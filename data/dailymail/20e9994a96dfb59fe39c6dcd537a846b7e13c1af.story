Jessica Devins, a photographer and graphic designer from Minneapolis, Minnesota, came up with a lovely way to announce to her husband that they were expecting.

Posing in a pizzeria photo booth, a tradition that tracks back to their first date, Jessica had planned the ultimate surprise - several months in the making.

In order to truly trick her man and ensure he wouldn't be suspicious, the mum-to-be had started taping her iPhone to the front wall of photo booths to capture video of their silly faces months earlier.

Jessica Devins came up with an adorably unique way to announce to her husband that the pair are expecting

In a pizzeria photo booth, Jessica snuck in a newborn-sized 'Baby' beanie to tell her husband the big news

It all starts when her husband asks which face he should make for the photo capture, to which his wife replies coyly, ‘Smiling first, I don’t know. Just wing it.’

Then, as the couple grin for the camera, she sneakily holds up a knit baby hat for all to see.

As her husband goes in for the next pose, she turns the hat, which reads ‘Baby’ across it towards him.

Photo booths are of special significance to the couple, who have been posing in them since their first date

To ensure her man stayed clueless, she began filming their photo booth snaps with her iPhone months earlier

Her husband's response was appropriately heartwarming, complete with tears, kisses and incredulous smiles

‘For real?’ he asks, seemingly shocked, as she laughs and nods.

Choked up with emotion, the man gives his wife a kiss before wiping the tears from his eyes.

‘I’m so happy!’ he exclaims, before quickly asking: ‘How long have you known?’

After revealing that she'd known for several months, her husband admitted: 'You got me'

To cap off their memorable photo shoot, the pair posed happily together with the sweet knit cap

‘Well, you got me,’ he admits, after a few more happy tears and kisses.

So how did the sweet couple cap off their memorable photo shoot? With one last smiling snap, together holding up the ‘Baby’ beanie cap, of course.

Baby Devins is due in June 2015.
