Raheem Sterling is a player Roy Hodgson saw as a versatile player at the World Cup in Brazil, trying him in a no 10 role and wide on the left as England were knocked out in the group stage.

And now the Liverpool playmaker has shown he is just as adaptable off the pitch - posing for photos in entirely different environments with his friends, and then members of his family.

Sterling will link up with Brendan Rodger's squad later this month after enjoying some time off after a long season at club level and a short, but tough, campaign with England.

But he is at least keeping himself amused during the downtime - meeting up with friends and taking his two sisters for dinner at TGI Friday's.

The 19-year-old posted the photo with his friends on Instagram with the caption: 'Ja turnt' before a trip to the American restaurant chain with family members.

Sterling is expected to be offered a new five-year deal at Liverpool after emerging as one of their star players towards the end of an ultimately unsuccessful Premier League campaign.

And fans will hope once pre season kicks off that he can continue his fine form and continue to be a versatile but prolific member of the squad once again.
