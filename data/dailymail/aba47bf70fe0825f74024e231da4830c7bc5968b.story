A tiny horse who suffers from a rare form of dwarfism has become an internet hit after his owner posted a video of him on Facebook. 

At just over 20 inches tall, Shammy is a third of the size of an average horse - but what he lacks in size he makes up for in personality.

As a result the five-month-old horse has a 500-strong following on Facebook and his owner, Michele Puryear, has written a book about him.

Ms Puryear said: 'He truly is a one in a million, dwarf horses are always very loveable and mischievous but Shammy is more affectionate than most.

'He is almost like a dog, he would rather be with me than with a herd of horses or even with his mama sometimes.' 

'He follows me around and runs in and out of the horse trailer - if he can find something to get into, he's going to get in to it.'

When he's not causing trouble around Ms Puryear's farm in the U.S. state of Georgia, Shammy loves nothing more than a good cuddle. 

She said: 'When I'm here I can just spend my time sitting on the ground with him and he'll stay with me until I make him get up - he just loves attention.

Almost famous: Shammy's antics inspired Ms Puryear to write a book about his adventures 

Small stead: Because of Shammy's condition he is likely to develop arthritis and heart problems

Happy couple: Ms Puryear said: 'When I'm here I can just spend my time sitting on the ground with him and he'll stay with me until I make him get up - he just loves attention.'

Keeping cool: Shammy wears a peaked cap as a fan leans in to pat his face

Feisty: Shammy is said to be mischievous, 'If he can find something to get into, he's going to get in to it'

'A lot of the time when I come home and get out of the car, he is stood there waiting at the gate and I have to stop what I'm doing and love him for a little while - he just can't resist.'

Ms Puryear was surprised at how quickly Shammy became an online star, with his Facebook account getting 90 visitors within 30 days of being activated. 

She said: 'People were just falling in love with him right away. They all want to take him home or buy him - but of course I would never sell him.

So cute: Shammy's owner normally breeds horses to sell but said she just 'couldn't with Shammy' 

'He's the only baby I ever kept. I usually breed my babies and sell them but I just couldn't with Shammy.' 

Unfortunately Shammy's condition will inevitably lead to problems later on in life, such as arthritis and heart issues.  

Ms Puryear, who works in finance and insurance, said: 'He won't ever be like the other horses, but I want him to be pain-free. That's my hope for Shammy.

'At any time he could lay down in his sleep and pass. So I try to treasure every moment, every spare moment I have I come and spend a few moments with him.'
