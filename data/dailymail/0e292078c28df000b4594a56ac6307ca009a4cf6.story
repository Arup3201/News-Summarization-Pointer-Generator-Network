Following two of the worst air tragedies in recent years, the shadow cast over Malaysia Airlines is growing ever darker.

A photo posted on Twitter claiming to show a Malaysia Airlines flight from Australia shows rows and rows of empty seats, with just three passengers visible. Another showed a young family enjoying the whole plane to themselves.

Meanwhile, nearly 200 cabin crew have resigned from the carrier, causing crew shortages among the staff still working for it.

Malaysia Airlines is rumoured to be ready to replace its chief executive as part of a major overhaul, and is expected to announce this week its earnings for the period between the disappearance of MH370 in March and the downing of MH17 over Ukraine in July.

Details of the revamp are said to involve a name change, rebranding and job cuts of up to 20 per cent of its 20,000 employees, as well as the slashing of routes along with what is expected to be woeful financial results. 

Around half of the airline's  employees are represented by the National Union of Flight Attendants Malaysia, which has halted previous reform.

Earlier this month, state investors Khazanah Nasional announced that they were offering to buy out the 31 per cent of the airline stock it does not already own.

In a statement, the airline said: 'We have received notice of Khazanah’s intentions to take full ownership and delist Malaysia Airlines. 

'Our Board of Directors will be deliberating this proposal and an official response from the company will be issued later. During this period, our business operations remain unchanged.'

The airline is said to be losing vast amounts of cash at a rate of around £1.3m ($2.16m) per day as it struggles to survive, with bookings at an all time low.

Troubled: Analysts believe Malaysia Airlines is unlikely to survive a year without a cash injection

In a bid to boost bookings, Malaysia Airlines has nearly doubled the commission for travel agents in Australia from 6 per cent to 11 per cent for flights

Meanwhile, the airline has confirmed there was a
 'spike' in crew members quitting their jobs following the loss of MH370
 on March 8 and the shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine on July 
17, which resulted in the loss of 537 lives.

Among those who left their jobs, a number cited fears for their safety as the reason for their resignation.

The
 airline said 186 crew had left in the first seven months of this year, 
with many blaming family pressure prompted by the incidents.

Malaysia
 Airlines confirmed in a statement: 'Following the MH17 incident, there 
was a spike in crew resignations but the number has now decreased to 
acceptable and routinely expected levels.'

Many cited 'family pressure' as the reason for their resignation due to the MH17 and MH370 tragedies.'

Concern: Nearly 200 cabin crew have resigned from Malaysia Airlines, causing crew shortages among the staff still working for it. Above, crew members are pictured weeping during a hand-over of bodies of flight MH17

Abdul Malek Ariff, secretary-general of the employees union, said some crew members 'are now afraid to fly'. But the airline said it was providing emotional and psychological support to workers.

In terms of finance, it is thought that Malaysia Airlines
 will employ Idris Jala, one of the country’s top economic policymakers,
 and the chief of the Malaysian government’s Economic Transformation 
Program. 

Some analysts say the airline is unlikely to survive a year without a cash injection from the Malaysian government.

Mohshin
 Aziz, aviation analyst at Malaysian financial company Maybank, told 
news.com.au: 'It’s completely not their fault, but right now if you ask 
any customers would they fly with Malaysia Airlines, they’d just have 
that negative sentiment of ‘I’d rather choose something else’.

Financial woes: Malaysian Airlines have allegedly been in the red for the past three years

The airline has allegedly been in the red for the past three years.

Ealier this month it came under fire after a passenger travelling on flight MH20 from Kuala Lumpur to Paris complained of inappropriate sexual behaviour by a member of the cabin crew. The member of staff in question was detained for questioning by the French police.

In a statement, the carrier said: 'Malaysia Airlines expects and accepts nothing short of the highest standards of conduct from its crew and takes any such allegations very seriously. 

'We will naturally assist the French authorities as they conduct their investigation and would stress that the safety, comfort and well-being of our passengers is always our highest priority.'
