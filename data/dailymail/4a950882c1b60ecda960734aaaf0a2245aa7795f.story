Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic has celebrated its inaugural Dreamliner flight with the first ever gig to be live streamed over the Atlantic Ocean.

UK chart toppers Rudimental and electronic music duo Gorgon City performed for an exclusive audience of fans and guests aboard the Boeing 787 and thousands of viewers who watched the performance on the airline's website.

The #Flightdecks gig, live streamed via the plane's wifi system, took place at 30,000ft as the aircraft flew from London Gatwick Airport to Atlanta, where co-owner Delta Air Lines is based, on Thursday.

Spinning their decks in the plane's 'upper class bar', Rudimental went up and down the aisles as they performed their two number one hit singles, Feel the Love and Waiting All Night, with live vocalists and horns.

They played back-to-back sets with Gorgon City as passengers were encouraged to get out of their seats and party.

The final set started with both bands walking the length of the plane accompanied by trumpet players and live vocalists as fans and guests sang along, according to the airline.

After the unique performance Amir Amor of Rudimental said: 'What a buzz. Having all the band together, playing to thousands of people around the world from the bar on a plane, you can't put a price on that. It's an experience we will never forget.'

Virgin's first regular commercial flights on the Dreamliner will be between London Heathrow and Boston starting Tuesday.

Other Dreamliner destinations from Heathrow will include Washington, Newark, New Jersey, and JFK International Airport in New York.

The Crawley-based airline's Dreamliner has been dubbed 'Birthday Girl' and features its 'Flying Lady', who is carrying a celebratory champagne coupe.

Virgin is hoping to Dreamliner will help to improve its standards, lure customers and reduce costs due to its fuel efficiency.

Airline spokesman Meigan Terry said: 'By adding the 787 to our fleet, we are taking a big step forward in innovation and an even bigger step forward in continuing our commitment to delight our customers.

'We decided to christen our new 787, Birthday Girl, in true Virgin Atlantic style and are thrilled to have both Rudimental and Gorgon City on board with us.'

Last year, the world's entire fleet was grounded for three months for repairs after lithium-ion batteries burned in two incidents in Japan and the United States. Boeing is confident the problems have been resolved.
