A U.S. tank commander has claimed he is America's deadliest soldier after having killed 2,746 enemy combatants.

Former Sgt Dillard Johnson notched up the incredible figure during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent years in combat.

The 48-year-old later trained as a sniper and 121 of the kills were down to his marksmanship.

He reportedly comes second in the number
of deadly hits to Navy SEAL Chris Kyle who had 160 kills and wrote a 
book about his exploits.

Johnson makes his claim to be the 
most deadliest soldier ever in the U.S. military in his new book Carnivore which documents his military service.

He was in charge of a Bradley 
Fighting Vehicle nicknamed the Carnivore during the 2003 Iraq invasion
and was at the forefront of the U.S. forces.

Johnson arrived at his total by 
counting the number of rifles and dead bodies he found after his tank 
engaged the enemy. He would jot down the numbers in a journal he kept 
during the war and a second tour of duty in 2005.

He was awarded as total of 37 medals for gallantry as well as a Purple Heart after being shot in the leg.

Johnson, who has retired from the 
army and works for an ammunition company in Daytona Beach, Florida, said
he does not like to boast about the number of people he killed in 
combat.

'It's sort of sad to say, but they are just another pencil mark,' he told the New York Post.

'I didn't think of the numbers. That's
not a boast I would make. I killed when I needed to. In my mind, I 
never killed anyone who wasn't trying to kill me or trying to do harm.'
