A former ballerina allows mothers to bring their babies to her pole-dancing class - and says it's cheaper than getting a babysitter.

Anna Milosevic, 34, from London, founded Pole Fit after she had her daughter Faye last summer and realised there was nowhere she could go to get her pre-baby body back, and bring her child with her.

The pole-dancing instructor's solution  was to create a class where new mums can work out on poles while their infants sit on cushions on the floor and watch - but she insists it's a clean-cut, family-friendly environment.

She has even added a soft play area so toddlers and older babies can  enjoy themselves as their mothers tackle the core-strengthening routines.

The 34-year-old, who is married to husband Vedran, 35, said she 'wanted to tone up' after the birth of her baby. 

Anna said she soon became aware of other mums who wanted to get fit post-birth but struggled with managing childcare. 

'I knew other new mums who wanted to lose their baby weight too.

After speaking to her midwife about the safety of post-natal exercise Anna decided to open her own class 

'Having trained as a pole fitness instructor I knew the benefits attached to pole dancing.

'The point is, you can come and get fit but you don't have to get a babysitter, just bring your babies with you.

'I don't teach the mums anything that you would see in a strip club and don't let the kids have a go because of the connotations. It's harmless.'

Children as young as a few months old watch their mothers twirling on the pole and she said the baby girls who attended the class liked it, while the boys were less interested.

Anna has designed her classes to fit around new mums, allowing them to bring children up to two into her lessons as she says that it is cheaper than childcare. Pictured: Some mums at a class

Anna's range of exercises are designed to help new mothers build up and strengthen their core muscles and improve their posture. Pictured: Anna teaching during her classes 

The babies are never allowed to join in on the classes but Anna says having them watch is harmless

'They don't care what's going on,' she said. 'It means their mums would get to exercise without having to find someone to babysit for them.'

The mother-of-one says that her classes are designed to go hand-in-hand with being a new mum and wanting to shape up.  

'Most mums already have upper body strength from picking up their babies.

'I spoke to my midwife to find out how soon new mums could exercise safely and what exercises were suitable.

Aside from the poles, the classes are crammed with toys for babies and young children to play

'I learned that eight weeks is enough time for the body to heal following a pregnancy, including after a woman has had a caesarean section.

'So only mums whose babies are eight weeks and older, and are fit enough to take part, are allowed to join.

'Some of the classes I run are shorter as newborns can get restless.'

Anna now holds classes for mothers with babies up to eight months old, then up to 18 months.

The classes are tailored so that mothers can tend to their babies at any point

Aside from the poles, the classes are crammed with toys for babies and young children to play with as well as soft mats and pillows help to keep the babies propped up and comfortable during the sessions.

The classes are tailored so that mothers can tend to their babies at any point, to feed them or stop them crying.

She added: 'My classes actually work better when there are lots of mums there.

'There are two people to every pole so while one mum is exercising the other can tend to their babies.'
