There is a lot of grumbling on the way here - and not just from me.

My wife's grievance is that, having given up alcohol for January, why on earth do we need to starve for a week in a remote part of Germany where we're bound to be confined to barracks because the weather will be foul.

I don't have the nerve to tell her we'll be pretty much confined to barracks whatever the weather, with an exhaustive timetable of treatments and deprivations.

My main worry is how to survive without coffee.

But a friend had said we should 'throw ourselves into it' and throw ourselves into it we do.

Lanserhof Tegernsee is the latest offering in homage to Franz Xaver Mayr (1875-1965), the Austrian physician who believed that health is centred in the gut. 

Lanserhof Tegernsee: More a sanatorium than a spa resort, albeit the most glamorous in the world...

In other words, get the plumbing right and everything flows nicely.

This outpost near Lake Tegernsee in Bavaria, about an hour south of Munich, has been open just over a year. It's a modernist monastery - all glass and wood and acres of calm space - built in a square around an outside courtyard with views of snow-capped mountains.

The 70 huge rooms are immaculately white, with more cupboards than in most one-bedroom flats.

Ours has two bathrooms - or, at least, two loos - which is a brilliant idea given the circumstances. My loo seat opens automatically when I stand in front of it.

When we arrive at 8pm on a Saturday most guests already have repaired to their rooms. Dinner, such as it is, starts at 5pm. But because we have not yet met the doctor and been given our programme, we are allowed soup and tender lamb chops for our first meal. Or last supper.

A member of staff quietly explains that we are not allowed to drink with our food and that we must chew everything 40 times before swallowing.

That pretty much rules out conversation - which is no bad thing, either, occasionally.

She also tells us to pick up our Epsom salts on the way to bed, which are to be drunk as soon as we wake up and at least half an hour before breakfast.

We're given a copy of the bible - Dr Erich Rauch's Health Through Inner Body Cleansing: The Famous F.X Mayr Intestinal Therapy. Not the sexiest of titles.

Our first morning does not start well. We sleep through breakfast (served from 7am to 8.30am) and have to ask for special dispensation to have our tiny bowl of spelt porridge.

Then we are measured and weighed. I'm nearly a stone and a half overweight, but am quickly told it's not a matter of burning more calories and that the doctor will see me shortly.

Which he does.

He thinks I could do with a liver detox (there's a surprise), some deep tissue massages (yes, please), plus a couple of intravenous (I hate needles) 'infusions' and various other treatments, including one called the 'hay pack'. 

Then he gives us detoxifying drops and acid-based capsules to be taken before meals and wishes us well.

My wife and I are put on the Level One diet for the first two days. Level 1 is harsh: yoghurt and stale bread for breakfast (good for chewing), same again at lunch and a pot of herbal tea for dinner. A buzz phrase here is 'the luxury of austerity'.

The stale bread is crucial. It means you have to chew, and the more you chew, the better. Saliva already gets to work breaking the food down so the gut has a much easier time further along the food chain, as it were.

'But where will the energy come from?' I had asked the doc. 'The detox,' he had said in that Germanic way that you do not question.

There's a gorgeous outdoor saltwater pool near the gym, but I haven't the energy to try it for the first four days.

I haven't the energy for very much, actually. This is not a spa resort, more a sanatorium, albeit the most glamorous sanatorium in the world. We are patients, not guests. The word 'therapy' is used a lot.

'Go with it,' a member of staff tells my wife, who, when not being treated, is in bed, the low point coming on day three when she hisses: 'Thanks so much for bringing me on this lovely holiday.' 

The 'hay pack' is a packet of straw that is placed round your liver, with a hot compress wrapped over it; 'energy island' involves lying on hot sand and staring up at lights that change colour; something called Feldenkrais is to do with the mind taking control of your muscles - at least I think that's right.

In the gym, fit young things come up with all kinds of exercises to improve balance, tone tummies and increase flexibility.

Lanserhof is all magnificently professional, discreet, caring, supportive. I turn native on day three and my big break-through comes on day four, when I bounce out of bed at 6.15am and join the communal 7am 'Awakening in the forest' session, where I imagine we'll be chanting 'the person I want to be is ME!' but in fact we just do some gentle warm-ups and watch the sky turn red behind the mountains.

I've hardly eaten a thing, but I'm a bundle of energy. I want to get things done. My skin is softer and less drawn. My eyes have rediscovered their sparkle (my wife assures me) and my belt has tightened by two notches.

Seeing the doctor the day before our departure is like an audience with the headmistress.

She is pleased with me. My abdomen has less gas and air in it and if I keep going once back in the real world, my life 'could change for ever'. I've also lost nearly 7lb. More importantly, I feel better than I have for years.

Lanserhof's seven-night basic programme (0049 8022 18800, www.lanserhof.com) costs from £2,824 pp, including all meals.
