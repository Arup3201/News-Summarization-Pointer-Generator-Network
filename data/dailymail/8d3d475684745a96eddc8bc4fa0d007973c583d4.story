Rick Lookebill bought his first car in 1972 - a lime green Mustang Mach 1 that was his pride and joy. Now, 24 years after giving it up, Lookebill's son has reunited him with his first love.

It's not known what the circumstances were surrounding Rick's parting with the vehicle - perhaps his growing family forced him to sell the Mustang for a more practical model.

Over the years, Lookebill talked about finding the car, even seeing it once in Clinton, Illinois back in 1999, but recently he redoubled his efforts to locate it.

All the while, his son was also secretly on the lookout for the Mustang, and in April this year, he found it in Florida.

After convincing the current owner to sell it to him, he drove the car back to its rightful owner at his home in Indiana.

Family members, in on the surprise, filmed the moments when Rick Lookebill realizes his beloved first car is sitting in his front yard.

The family gathers around a window facing the front yard of the house in Brazil, Indiana.

'Oh my god!' exclaims someone. 'Dad, what is that?' asks Lookebill's daughter.'What?' says Lookebill, looking alarmed. 'What's the matter?!'

His alarm turns into a huge smile when he sees (and hears) what's in the garden.

Lookebill runs out to the front yard and he and his son embrace.

Unchanged: After 24 years, nothing had been done to the body of the car

'Paying you back, buddy,' says the son to his father.

Lookebill approaches the car looking awestruck, opens the door and rubs the paintwork.

'Can you believe it?' asks his son.

'No!' comes the response.

Lookebill and his wife hug in front of the car's open door - perhaps where they had their first kiss. The father rubs his eyes beneath his glasses and looks at the camera, shaking his head in disbelief.

Emotional: Lookebill was briefly overcome

Then, 24 years after losing it, Lookebill gets into his car with his wife in the passenger seat.

Rick pulls out of the drive and then revs the engine, clearly having lost none of his boy racer enthusiasm over the intervening 24 years.

And the car sounds just as pleased to be back with its owner.
