Police said an argument broke out between the elderly man and the 40-year-old driver of another car after a minor collision east of Melbourne at about 9.30am on Tuesday.

Police said it's believed the younger man pushed the 72-year-old in the chest after the older man 'became aggressive'. 

Nine News reports that the 40-year-old entered a nearby building afterwards but when he later returned to his car, he found the 72-year-old on the ground.

Investigations are continuing as police are speaking to witnesses at the car park.
