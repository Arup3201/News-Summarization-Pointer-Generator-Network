There's nothing quite like bathing beneath the stars, even if the rest of your bathroom has crumbled into an abandoned mine.

That was the fate of the family who live in this house - swallowed up by one of Cornwall's countless unplotted shafts.

They fled the semi-detached home earlier this week after two-inch cracks appeared in the walls.

Then today just after 5am, a 'loud rumbling' gave neighbours a rude awakening.

Shall we go back to mine? Exhibitionists would love this attractive open-air bathroom... after one wall collapsed into an abandoned mine shaft this morning. The family in Camborne, Cornwall, had fled after seeing cracks

Exposed: It is thought the hole was been covered with slowly-rotting railway sleepers hundreds of years ago

An entire corner of the stone three-bedroom house toppled into the mine shaft, which was most likely used to harvest tin and copper.

It
 is believed the hole in the town of Camborne could have lain undetected
 for hundreds of years covered only by slowly-rotting railway sleepers.

The
 road has been shut outside the rubble-strewn house and cars are being 
directed around the scene with temporary traffic lights.

Michael
 Williams, who lives in the house with his wife, his son and his son's 
fiancée, told the BBC he had raised the alarm after seeing cracks in the
 walls.

Postmistress Barbara Beach added: 'We noticed a huge crack in the house. It was as if a couple of huge lorries were passing by.'

Room with a view: If nothing else, the house now stands out from its neighbours. In the nearby village of Troon engineers are working on a £1.6m project to stop homes sliding into a 300-year-old tunnel network

The heavy rain deluging Britain has opened up several holes in the ground. Yesterday a gap opened up in a road near the Cornwall town of Helston.

And
 engineers are due to finish a £1.6 million project to stop a row of 
houses from collapsing into a network of 300-year-old shafts in the 
village of Troon, two miles from today's incident.

The houses are held up by huge steel girders and piles 46ft deep in the earth.

Andy
 Richards, Camborne conservation officer for Cornwall Council, told 
MailOnline: 'There've been a number of collapses in former mining 
settlements.

'There are unplotted shafts and several collapses in gardens which seem to happen very quickly.

'When you find one you need to sort it out quickly and it usually involves capping the shafts with a concrete plug or a grill.

'People used to use railway sleepers or build a hedge around the entrances.'

It's a minefield: Cornwall's mining rush in the mid-1800s left a large number of dangerous unmapped shafts

A Cornwall Council spokesman confirmed a corner the home had collapsed into a 'mine feature' and was unoccupied at the time.

'Our Building Control... co-ordinated switching off services and fencing off the property,' the spokesman added. 'The
 situation is in the hands of the insurance company and loss adjusters, 
who our structural engineers are liaising with to determine a plan to 
make the building secure and remediate.

'Our
 structural engineers will be keeping a close eye on future 
investigations with respect to highway safety and any subsequent 
remediation should it affect the highway.

'There is no timescale at present for the works.'

At
 their peak in the mid-1800s there were 400 active mines across 
Cornwall, which broke new ground in technology and exported their skills
 all over the world.

The county had been exporting metals for thousands of years, with copper used for coins while tin became used for storing food.

But
 the rush of industry left many dangerous unmapped shafts, and others 
which were open to ramblers and children who didn't watch their step.
