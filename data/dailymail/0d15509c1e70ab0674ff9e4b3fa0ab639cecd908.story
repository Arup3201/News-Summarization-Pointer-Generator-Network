Michael Jackson's doctor was on the phone to his mistress at around the time the King of Pop stopped breathing, jurors in the Conrad Murray trial heard today.

Cocktail waitress Sade Anding revealed that Murray suddenly broke off from their call and she couldn't get back in touch with him.

Prosecutors claim the 11.51am call on June 25, 2009 was interrupted because the doctor had discovered Jackson's heart had stopped - but nobody called for an ambulance until 12.21pm.

Expressive: Murray's current girlfriend, actress Nicole Alvarez, 29, pulled a variety of poses as she took to the stand to tell how the doctor called her while her was in the ambulance with Jackson on route to hospital

Met Jacko: The actress said Murray took her along to meet Jackson at his Los Angeles mansion and the star took a special interest in her baby son

Miss Anding was one of a procession of Murray's girlfriends - including a stripper and his current live-in partner and mother of his two-year-old son - who testified at Los Angeles Superior Court.

She said she first met Murray at a Houston, Texas, restaurant and was chatting about her day to the doctor when she realised he was no longer listening. 'I heard mumbling sounds and coughing and voice. I kept saying, hello, hello, are you there? But I didn't get any reply,' she added.

Earlier that morning, Murray also left a message on the phone of Michelle Bella, an exotic dancer he met in Las Vegas the previous year, the court heard.

And jurors heard from another ex-girlfriend, Bridget Morgan, who testified that she called Murray earlier on the morning of the day Jackson died, but she said that he didn't pick up.

The court was told that Murray, 58, was on the phone for 46 minutes of the hour before Jackson died while prosecutors claim he should have been caring for Jackson.

Murray has pleaded no guilty to involuntary manslaughter by administering Jackson, then 50, with a fatal dose of the hospital anaesthetic Propofol.Â 

The prosecution claims the stream of 
phone calls to his girlfriends diverted the doctor at a crucial time 
when he should have been at the singer's side.

Murray
was also on the phone to his current girlfriend, Nicole Alvarez, at 
1.08pm when he was travelling in the ambulance with Jackson to the 
hospital, still pushing paramedics to try and revive the lifeless 
entertainer.

'I 
remember him telling me that he was on the way to the hospital with Mr 
Jackson and for me not to be alarmed. He didn't want me to be worried 
because he knew I would hear through the news and I would be upset,' she
said.

Murray went on to call Miss Alvarez four more times through the afternoon.

Miss Alvarez, 29, said she has been living with Murray for the last three to four years and had a son with him in March, 2009.

Prosecutors today put four of Dr Conrad Murray's girlfriends in front of the jury in an effort to establish the exact timeline of the 58-year-old's actions the day Jackon died.

Nicole Alvarez - the actress and mother to Murray's two-year-old son said he called her while in the ambulance on route to hospital

Sade Anding - cocktail waitress who met Murray in Houston was on the phone to him when Michael Jackson's heart stopped

Michelle Bella - exotic dancer Murray met in Las Vegas last year said he called her earlier in the morning and left a message

Bridget Morgan - a former girlfriend who rang Murray on the morning of Jackson's death but he did not pick up

The
actress said Murray took her along to meet Jackson at his Los Angeles 
mansion and the star took a special interest in her baby son.

'I first met him in 2008. It was a 
surprise and I was speechless. Michael was very excited about the 
pregnancy. He wanted to schedule visits so he could see my son and I 
went to see him one of two times during the day and once in the 
evening,' she added.

Miss
Alvarez said Murray paid the $2,300 rent on her Santa Monica, 
California, apartment. While he was working at nights caring for 
Jackson, his girlfriend said she was 'maintaining my instrument' to look
for acting jobs in Hollywood.

She confirmed receiving a series of 
packages at her apartment in the months before the star's death. 
Prosecutors have told the court they were shipments of Propofol, but 
Miss Alvarez denied any knowledge of what was in the packages.

Miss Alvarez said after April 2009, Murray would frequently leave her 
apartment at night and return early the next day.

She said she knew 
Murray was working as Jackson's personal doctor while the singer 
prepared for a series of comeback concerts.

Numerous calls: Earlier in the morning, Murray also left a message on the phone of Michelle Bella, an exotic dancer while another ex-girlfriend, Bridget Morgan, said she left him a message the same day

Arriving: Rebbie Jackson and Randy Jackson (left) arrive outside the courthouse where trial for Dr. Conrad Murray continues over the death of their brother Michael Jackson

At the time of Michael Jackson's death, Conrad Murray was
married to Blanche, his medical school classmate, and had a family home in Las
Vegas. He has six children with four different mothers.

Neither his marriage nor his tangled love life were
directly referred to in yesterday's hearing as a result of the judge's ruling
that Murray's private life should be kept out of the evidence where possible.
