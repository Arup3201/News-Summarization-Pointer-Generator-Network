With the sun on our skin, more of our bodies exposed, lazy afternoons at the pub fuelled by gallons of Rose it's really no surprise that our libidos lift during summer.

Which makes this the perfect time to talk about how to size up a potential new lover, with hardly any effort at all on your part!

Here are 13 secret signs that giveaway much more than he realises and help you figure out if he's worth it...

Tracey says that a man who bites his nails pushes boundaries which equates to passion meaning they make great lovers

He bites his nails

Nail-biters push themselves to the limits (hence the stress-busting biting habit) by pushing boundaries and going to extremes - which usually equates to passion. It might not look attractive but it can mean they're a great lover!

He owns a dog

They're used to putting others needs first (handy in bed for you!) and used to dealing with doggy drools and moulting hair, so unlikely to be a hygiene freak (the ultimate turn-off in bed).

He's no Bradley Cooper

If he's not terribly good-looking, he's not innundated with women pressing their bodies against his.So it's likely he'll spend time and effort keeping the ones that do, happy.

He's got loopy handwriting

According to handwriting specialists, people who sign a lowercase 'y' with a flourish in the tail have high libidos and lots of imagination.

He smells...divine

Smell is one of the indicators of attraction and the better he smells to you, the more genetically complementary the two of you may be.

He's erect

As in stands up straight! Posture is indicative of laziness. If he stands with shoulders back and tummy in, he'll make an effort.

Good posture also usually means the person is confident.

Tracey says that even small gestures like having flexible thumbs can give away a lot about what a man is like in bed

He isn't scared to take the mickey out of himself

Anyone who can laugh at themselves out of bed, is going to be unselfconscious in it. If his humour is self-deprecating, it's a great sign he doesn't take himself too seriously and isn't ego-centred.

He's bi-lingal

It's a very good sign if he speaks more than one language because it implies intelligence and effort: he's willing to work hard for rewards.

A fab attribute in a long-term lover!

He gets road rage

He'll be an impatient lover who's obsessed with the final destination (orgasm - his) and uninterested in the travelling (usually when you get yours).

If he's a fast driver, fasten your seatbelt but go along for the ride: it usually means he's passionate and into lusty, wanton sex.

Steer clear of cautious, slower-than-your-granny type drivers - even she'd want more action!

He's set in his daily routine

If he hyperventilates when forced to catch the 6.05 rather than the 6.03, it's a bit of a worry sexually.

He's robotic and so stinks of predictability: chances are he makes love in exactly the same way, every single time (and don't even think about moving an inch to the left or he'll wonder what's wrong).

It's one thing to find something good and stick to it, but it does help if he's flexible enough to mould to your needs.

He's attached at the hip - to his friends

The fact that he only moves as one means he'll be a nervous lover. He'd need lots of encouragement and approval before he'll relax because he's probably not terribly good at thinking for himself.

If you're a dominant lover and don't mind playing teacher, go for it! If you know what you want, he'll fit in with you.

But don't expect any surprises: he's probably got a few techniques down pat, but he's too scared to take a risk and veer into unchartered kingdoms.

He's talks with his hands

If he's using big, sweeping, dramatic movements, it probably translates well into the bedroom. It usually means he's imaginative and creative and will want sex to be a 'production'.

He's got flexible thumbs

See if he measures up to the ultimate sex flex by pulling his thumb: the ancient Chinese believed the more flexible it is, the more adventurous the lover.

If you can hardly pull his thumb away from the main body of the palm, he's a straight, conservative lover. The further it flexes, the more bent he becomes.

Take a good look at it while you're there: a large or long and heavy thumb means he's got vast amounts of sexual energy and likes to take control. Short thumbs aren't fab (weak-willed) but thumbs set very low on his hand are - this guy's sexually unconventional and highly adventurous.
