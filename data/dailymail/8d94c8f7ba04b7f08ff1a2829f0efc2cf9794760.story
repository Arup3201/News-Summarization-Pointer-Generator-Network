A toddler who suffered six cardiac arrests before his first birthday has made a miraculous recovery thanks to a pioneering operation.

One-year-old Joshua Newman was born three months prematurely with a severe heart condition that left him fighting for his life.

After suffering six cardiac arrests - four of them at just two hours old – doctors performed an operation that had never before been carried out on a baby so small.

After 22 weeks in hospital Joshua has recovered and is now at home with his family in Chelmsford, Essex.

Joshua Newman, one, of Chelmsford, Essex has recovered after suffering six cardiac arrests before his first birthday due to congenital heart disease

Doctors at the Royal Brompton hospital in London were unable to give Joshua's parents survival odds as the surgery he needed to widen his artery had not been performed there before on babies so young

It took Suzy Newman, 37, and her husband Alan eight years to conceive Joshua with IVF treatment.

At the 20-week scan she was told her baby had a heart condition and would need surgery as soon as he was born.

But, she said that did not prepare her for what happened when her son was born.

She said: ‘When Joshua was born it felt like a nightmare - it was so surreal.

‘A doctor explained to us that he’d suffered four cardiac arrests, and they didn’t know how long they could keep resuscitating him.

‘We couldn’t believe it - four cardiac arrests - it was horrifying.

‘After I gave birth my husband and I just had to sit for two hours and wait to find out if our baby was alive.

’But I just remember thinking that this wasn’t going to be how our story ended.’ 

Joshua was diagnosed with congenital heart disease in the womb. He was born with two holes in his heart and a narrowing of the aorta, the main artery in the body.

Mrs Newman said: 'When Joshua was born if felt like a nightmare - it was so surreal. My husband and I just had to sit for two hours and wait to find out if our baby was alive'

Suzy and Alan Newman cried and hugged each other in the street when they found out son Joshua had survived an emergency operation to widen his artery. He is pictured right with one of his surgeons

The narrow artery meant Joshua’s tiny heart was under too much pressure to pump blood around the body, causing him to go into cardiac arrest.

After being born at the family’s local hospital, Joshua was transferred to Royal Brompton, a specialist heart and lung hospital in London.

It was decided he needed an operation to widen his artery, but this type of surgery was not normally carried out on babies so small.

After initial scans, doctors there said the problem didn’t appear to be too severe, so they sent him back to the local hospital to grow bigger.

But Joshua began to go downhill, having yet another cardiac arrest, and sent straight back to Royal Brompton. 

His small size was still an issue, and so once again it was decided to wait until he grew bigger before he would have the operation, but he was struggling to gain weight.

As Joshua’s condition became worse, doctors were forced to operate.

Mrs Newman said she was petrified, as doctors were not able to say whether Joshua was likely to survive. 

She said: ‘The anaesthetist at the time said they couldn’t give us any survival odds as they didn’t have any for the type of operation on a baby so small.

‘We were told the words that no parent ever wants to hear - they might not be able to bring our precious baby back. 

 Mrs Newman said: 'That day Joshua broke Royal Brompton history and opened up new pathways for pioneering surgery to be performed on tiny babies in the future’

The Newman family are raising money for a £4.5 million state-of-the-art operating theatre for the Royal Brompton hospital in London, where Joshua received the surgery that saved his life

‘Waiting for the phone call to tell us whether he had survived the operation was truly one of the worst times of our lives.'

She describes the feeling of joy when she found out Joshua had survived.

She said: ‘But we were delighted when we were told that Joshua had pulled through - we were crying and hugging each other in the middle of the street.

‘That day Joshua broke Royal Brompton history and opened up new pathways for pioneering surgery to be performed on tiny babies in the future.’

Unfortunately, scans after the operation showed that Joshua’s problem had returned and he would need further surgery.

Twelve weeks later, Joshua had finally grown bigger, and the second surgery was performed - and this time it was successful. 

Donor tissue was placed into Joshua’s heart to make a bigger pathway allowing the blood to flow to the rest of his body without being obstructed.

They tiny holes in his heart were also fixed.

Once again, waiting for her son to come out of surgery was terrifying for Mrs Newman and her husband.

She said: ‘Eight very, very long hours later they brought our little hero back from surgery and yet again he had been amazing.

‘He was very poorly afterwards - and suffered yet another cardiac arrest a few days later - we couldn’t believe he’d had yet another one!

‘But once again he took it all in his stride.’

After 19 weeks in intensive care Joshua finally began to improve and doctors began to allow him to breathe for himself.

Mrs Newman said she was ‘over the moon’, when she was finally able to take Joshua home 22 weeks after he was born.

She added: ‘Walking through the door of our home, with no machines, nurses, or doctors, was the scariest thing ever.

‘But a year on, he’s doing amazingly well - he’s strong willed and determined, as he has always been!

She is now raising money for the hospital’s charity to open a new state-of-the-art operating theatre.

She thanks the hospital for their help at a truly difficult time.

She said: ‘The Royal Brompton has been fantastic and we can’t thank the staff enough - not only did they look after Joshua but they looked after us too.

‘We met so many amazing people there, it is a truly inspirational place.

‘The charity needs £4.5 million in total, but we’re determined to do our bit - they saved our son’s life, and we couldn’t be happier.’

Unless someone starts cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) the person may suffer permanent damage to the brain and other organs

A cardiac arrest happens when your heart stops pumping blood around the body.

If you have a cardiac arrest, you lose consciousness almost at once.

There are also no other signs of life such as breathing or movement.

This is an emergency and if you witness a cardiac arrest you should call 999 immediately.

What is the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest?

A cardiac arrest is different from a heart attack.

Most heart attacks are caused by coronary heart disease.

If you have a heart attack, it does not always lead to a cardiac arrest.

A cardiac arrest does not always happen because you have a heart condition.

If you witness a cardiac arrest, you can increase the person’s chances of survival by phoning 999 and giving immediate CPR.

Treating a cardiac arrest 

Unless someone starts cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) the person may suffer permanent damage to the brain and other organs. 

Ambulance staff are trained in advanced resuscitation and all emergency ambulances carry a defibrillator.

What causes a cardiac arrest?

The most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF).

Ventricular fibrillation occurs when the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead.
