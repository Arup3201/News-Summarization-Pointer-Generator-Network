Shrien Dewani Dewani, who has been diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, was not at today¿s hearing

The British man accused of murdering his wife on honeymoon 'could kill himself' if he is extradited to South Africa to face allegations of masterminding the killing, the High Court was told today.

Shrien Dewani's mental health has deteriorated to the point where he was 'too ill to be extradited' and was a suicide risk, his barrister said.

He could also face violence from other prisoners if held in south Africa, she warned.

Care home owner Dewani, from Bristol, is accused of arranging the contract killing of wife Anni in Cape Town in November 2010. He denies any wrongdoing.

Home Secretary Theresa May signed an order for his extradition after District Judge Howard Riddle ruled at Belmarsh Magistrates’ Court in south east London in August that the 31-year-old should be sent back to South Africa to stand trial.

But today Clare Montgomery QC, appearing for Dewani, asked two judges to block the extradition order on mental health grounds.

As family members looked on, Ms Montgomery also argued he was at serious risk of violence - including sexual violence - at the hands of other prisoners if kept in custody in South Africa.

Ms Montgomery said 'explicit public 
hostility' towards him had been fanned by the country's police and 
prosecutors, and the authorities would not be able to provide sufficient
protection.

'It will not be consistent with humanitarian principle to send some for extradition who is not fit to stand trial,' Ms Montgomery told judges.

'Were Mr Dewani to be extradited today, according to English standards, he would not be fit to stand his trial.'

She added: 'We do submit it will always be unjust to extradite somebody who is unfit - no matter how serious the charge.'

Mrs Dewani, 28, from Sweden, was shot when a taxi the couple were travelling in was hijacked in the Gugulethu township on the outskirts of Cape Town.

She was found dead in the back of the
abandoned vehicle with a bullet wound to her neck after taxi driver 
Zola Tongo drove the newlyweds to the impoverished area.

He and Mr Dewani were ejected by the hijackers before Mrs Dewani was driven away and shot.

Tongo,
who has admitted his part in the crime, claimed in a plea agreement 
with prosecutors that Dewani ordered the carjacking and paid for a hit 
on his wife.

Dewani, who has been diagnosed with 
severe post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression, was not at 
today’s hearing at London’s High Court.

Ms Montgomery argued he was so ill that he would be incapable of giving instructions to his lawyers or following trial proceedings, and extradition should be delayed until he had recovered.

The QC told Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen’s Bench Division, and Mr Justice Ouseley, that the businessman had always wished for a fair trial.

'However that is, at the moment, on the advice we have been given by those who are treating him, not possible.'

His illnesses began to develop shortly after the murder of his wife and before he was accused of her murder.

In April this year he was sectioned under the 1983 Mental Health Act to a psychiatric unit for his own protection, and in November was re-sectioned for a further six months following a deterioration in his condition.

All the doctors who had examined him, including the expert instructed by the South African government, agreed that he was suffering from PTSD and depression, said Ms Montgomery.

In a hearing expected to last two days, she asked the High Court to discharge the extradition order, or adjourn its implementation.

She argued that District Judge Riddle had fallen into error when he accepted South African assurances that Dewani’s life and health would not be endangered if he was sent back to South Africa.

She argued the limited assurances that were given were 'incapable of fulfilment'.

Ms Montgomery told the court Judge 
Riddle should have ordered Dewani’s discharge under section 91 of the 
Extradition Act 2003 on the grounds that sending him back would 
'manifestly endanger his health or risk his life'.

Today's application is being opposed by the South African government.Written statements before the court from Dewani's legal team say that his illnesses cannot be treated with anti-depressant medication because he suffers from a life-threatening drug reaction.

His recovery is likely to be 'slow and unpredictable'.

They state he is being visually checked every 15 to 20 minutes at his psychiatric unit because he is a high suicide risk.

Ms Montgomery told the judges that the risk would increase 'to an unacceptable level' if he was extradited.

The suicide management capacity of the South African prison system was 'inadequate', as had been admitted by the Prisons Inspector, she contended.

Experts also agreed that there was no evidence that the psychiatric hospital available to care for him could adequately treat his complex illnesses.

Extradition would be incompatible with articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protect the right to life and prohibit inhuman and degrading treatment.

In addition to Dewani being at 
increased risk of suicide, he would also be at serious risk of violence 
from other prisoners in the South African prison system, she claimed.

Ms Montgomery argued that Judge
Riddle had wrongly relied on limited South African undertakings to 
protect his health, and no effective undertakings had been given to 
protect him from sexual violence or other violence at the hands of 
prisoners.
