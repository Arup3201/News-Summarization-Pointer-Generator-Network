These remarkable shots reveal just how easy it is to fake dramatic weight loss in just 15 minutes.

Australian personal trainer Melanie Ventura recreated her own inspirational weight loss images, posted to her blog MelVFitness.blogspot.com.au, using some clever tricks used by the billion-dollar diet and fitness industries in before-and-after photos.

Inspired by personal trainer Andrew Dixon's step-by-step guide to faking a dramatic transformation, Ventura posted two pictures of herself showing the difference a change of lighting and bigger underpants can make in just 15 minutes.

Myth busting: Melanie Ventura's 'before' and 'after' pictures were taken within 15 minutes of each other, with the personal trainer using tricks of the trade to give the impression she lost weight

Ventura then explained on her blog how she did it.

For her first unflattering picture (left), the trainer ate a big breakfast, wore her tight bather bottoms and let her body sag.

But within 15 minutes, Ventura transformed herself into a lean and fit glamazon just by employing these tricks (right).

She changed her bather bottoms from red to black, 'cause they're a size bigger 
& black is slimming', and 'smothered on some fake tan'.

She clipped in long hair
 extensions, stood up a bit taller, sucked in her stomach, stood with legs wide and her hand on her 'popped' hip, pulled back her shoulders and wore a 'cheeky' grin.  

'Zoomed
 in on the before pic- zoomed out on the after & added a filter. 
Cause filters make everything awesome,' Ventura wrote.

'What's my point? Don't be 
deceived by what you see in magazines & on Instagram.You never see
 the dozens of other pics they took that wernt [sic] as flattering. Photoshop 
can make a pig look hotter then Beyonce.

'I feel like these '2 week progress' pictures set people up with unrealistic expectations of how fast they should be getting results. What a before and after shot doesn’t tell you how the person achieved it.'

Illusion: Melanie Ventura transformed herself in 15 minutes using body glow, make up, hair extensions, large black underpants and ditched the phone wallet

Concerned the before and after pictures often used in advertisements don't take account of how people lost weight, Ventura also posted 'a real life transformation photo that took a whole lot more effort than a few hair extensions and some fake tan'.

The first picture of Ventura (left) was taken in 2010 on a family holiday after a trip to America where she gained 17 pounds.

'I went to Vegas twice, I tried all the food, I drank almost every night, I went out dancing, I had desserts, and really had the most amazing time,' she wrote.

'Although i remember feeling sh***y about my body in that photo, to be honest I didn’t really care that much- I knew I would lose the weight eventually.

'I had lots of friends, I was confident, I went out all the time and people just gathered around me to soak up my awesomeness.. haha ok ok, maybe not, but I was pretty carefree!'

The incredible 'after' photo was taken three years later, when Ventura had 'become obsessed with fitness', teaching eight classes a week as a fitness instructor and then becoming a personal trainer. 

Over six months, she overhauled her diet, socially isolated herself, stopped weekend drinking and left parties early to gain a six-pack.

'I become totally obsessed with my progress, I had my skin folds done weekly, I trained like a dog and rescheduled my photo shoot 2 times so that I would have ‘more time’ to get leaner,' she wrote.

'By the time the photo shoot finally happened It was almost 6 months later, I was exhausted, Yeah i looked good on the outside- but I was a mess on the inside. I was tired, moody, i'd tainted good friendships and I actually really hated the person I had become [sic].'

Real before and after: The picture to the left was taken while Melanie Ventura was on a gluttonous vacation in 2010, while the picture to the right was shot in 2012 when Ventura had lost 15 pounds through disciplined training

Ventura said the best way to change your body is not by buying into the misleading 'two week progress' weight loss shots, but to 'learn about food, come up with an achievable plan and most importantly enjoy how you exercise and live your life.'

'Oh and transformation shots are great, but let it be clear- that being thinner doesnt always mean youll be happier, transformations take time, and good lighting can make buddah have a 6 pack [sic],' she advised.
