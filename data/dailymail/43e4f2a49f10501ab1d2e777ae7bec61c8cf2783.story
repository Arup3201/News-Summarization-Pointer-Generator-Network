Mario Balotelli needs to score more goals, according to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.

The Italian forward joined the club from AC Milan this summer in a £16million deal but has so far failed to live up to his billing.

While Rodgers admits Balotelli is working hard and trying to build his fitness, the former Swansea boss says the 24-year-old will ultimately be judged on his scoring record.

Rodgers said: 'I think in terms of his behaviour since he's come into here, into the training, he's consciously trying to work hard at the aspects of the game of which we would demand here at Liverpool in terms of his intensity and that work rate.

'I think in terms of goals he needs to improve. It's as simple as that.

'As a striker, not just him but any striker or attacking player, you're judged on your goals and your games and the number of assists that you make. 

'Of course at this moment he hasn't probably hit the numbers that he would want to.' 

The former Manchester City star posted a string of photos on his Instagram account of himself modelling the new PumaxBape range.
