NBC’s Brian Williams has long been considered one of America’s favorite news anchors, but his skills as a hip hop MC had for too long gone unnoticed until ‘Late Night’ host Jimmy Fallon recently revealed all.

Back in June, Fallon featured Williams hitting up some 90s West Coast flavor with a mash-up of Warren G’s 'Regulate' and Dr Dre's 'Nuthin but a 'G' Thang', but on Tuesday night's show it was time for Brian to get old skool (sic) with a blast of Young MC’s classic 80s cut ‘Bust A Move.’

The hilarious footage was created by splicing together Williams' words from countless news broadcasts to create an almost seamless mash-up of the first and second verses of the 1989 classic all about the age-old story of boys trying to impress the ladies.

‘Bust A Move’ was a top ten hit for the Young MC back in 1989 and won a Grammy the following year for ‘Best Rap Performance’.

It has since passed into hip hop folklore and was even covered on an early episode of ‘Glee’. 

The world waits with baited breath to see which rap classic Williams’ decides to tackle next.

He is currently taking a break from anchoring NBC Nightly News after telling viewers during last Thursday's show that he was having a complete knee replacement.

This here's a jam for all the fellasTryin to do what those ladies tell usGet shot down cause ya over-zealousPlay hard to get females get jealousOkay smarty go to a partyGirls are scantily clad and showin bodyA chick walks by you wish you could sex herBut you're standing on the wall like you was PoindexterYour movie's showin, so you're goinCould care less about the five you're blowinTheater gets dark just to start the showThen ya spot a fine woman sittin in your rowShe's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello,come sit next to me you fine fellow."You run over there without a second to loseAnd what comes next hey bust a move

The surgery isn't because someone has popped a cap in it, jealous of his rapping skills, but because he damaged it a high school football game decades ago.

Williams discussed the knee replacement surgery in a Nightly News segment last Thursday about the procedure by Dr. Nancy Snyderman.

'If
you don't see me around here for a while, this is the reason why,' he 
said, describing the 'helmet to the knee' injury he suffered playing 
high school football.

'I have been in pain for 35 years,' 
said Williams. 'I have paid a very high price from what's been confirmed
to be the single worst New Jersey high school Catholic League football 
career in history,' he joked.

Lester Holt will anchor the nightly news while Williams is away.

Williams, 54, said he's had three 
previous surgeries on his right knee but the pain was becoming more of 
an issue. When it began costing him sleep, Williams said he realized it 
was time to take care of it.

'If this doesn't go perfectly, it can't hurt any more than it does now,' he said.

Snyderman said most people who have knee replacement surgery miss between three weeks and three months of work, depending on the physical nature of their jobs. Full recovery takes between six months and a year.

Williams joked during an appearance on David Letterman's Late Show two weeks ago that 'I want to come back almost a little too early gooned on medication. I think it will be great viewing.'

His newscast showed a rare sign of ratings vulnerability last week. The Nielsen company said ABC's World News beat NBC among the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that most news advertising sales are based on, breaking an NBC winning streak of 243 consecutive weeks. NBC won when viewers of all ages were counted.
