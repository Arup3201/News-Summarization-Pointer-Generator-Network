Despite a raft of injuries, England are lucky enough to still be able to call on the goalscoring exploits of Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane ahead of their glamour friendly with Italy.

But Italian centre back Giorgio Chiellini is more concerned about the presence of Theo Walcott, the Arsenal winger with just three goals this campaign who hasn't started for his country in over 18 months.

Kane and Rooney have 50 goals between them this season, but Juventus star Chiellini picked out the 'terrifying' Walcott when asked which England players he admired most in the build-up to Tuesday's clash in Turin.

Walcott has struggled to find a place in the team for both Arsenal and England since returning from a knee injury that ruled him out for seven months and saw him miss last summer's World Cup.

But Chiellini believes that England are foolish to ignore the player he sees as one of his biggest threats on Tuesday evening at the Juventus Stadium. 

'I am always a fan of Walcott, a quick sprinter and terrifying for defenders,' Chiellini said. 'England notice his absence. For the world of football, it is positive that Walcott recuperates totally to his top level.'

Italy beat England 2-1 in last summer's World Cup and also eliminated the Three Lions from Euro 2008 in a quarter-final penalty shoot-out.

And Chiellini wants to make it three wins from three games against the English in a game he refuses to view as the friendly it has been billed as. 

'This is not a friendly match because matches between England and Italy are always of interest to the whole world.

'England have pride and want to avoid defeat even though this is not an official competition.

'The match is not a comfortable one because our victory at the World Cup is still very present in the mind and perhaps their hopes of revenge will make this a very intense match.'

Walcott came back from a seven-month injury lay-off and has struggled to find a place in either of his teams
