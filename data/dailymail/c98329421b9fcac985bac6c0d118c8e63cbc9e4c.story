GCSEs are the ‘new 11-plus’ as top universities are increasingly using them as a way to weed out candidates for degree courses, according to an Oxford don.

Dr Peter Claus warned that the approach disadvantages late bloomers in the same way as the 11-plus, which determines entrants to grammar schools.

Dr Claus, a historian based at Pembroke College, admitted that Oxford was ‘as guilty as anybody else in that’.

Exams: GCSEs are increasingly used by top universities to weed out degree candidates, claims an Oxford don

Advice to candidates from the university states that it ‘could not be optimistic of an applicant’s chances of gaining a place at Oxford without a high percentage of A* and A grades at GCSE’.

Dr Claus admitted that, as a late starter, he would have failed to reach Oxford’s high GCSE standards himself.

Many of the most sought-after courses at other competitive universities use high GCSE grades as a filter to decide which candidates to shortlist.

But critics are concerned that this approach could harm the chances of students who blossom post-16, particularly those from less well-off backgrounds or lower-performing schools, who may be unaware of the high GCSE entry requirements needed for the top universities.

The GCSE is turning into a kind of the new grammar school 11-plus type of qualification,’ Dr Claus told a conference held last week by The Brilliant Club, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to get bright pupils from non-selective schools into leading universities.

‘Oxford, I suspect, is as guilty as anybody else in that. Certainly some, not necessarily Oxford’s, of our university programmes are setting a very high bar for young people trying to get GCSEs.

'They’ve got GCSEs but perhaps not high enough GCSEs at that particular stage. I would have been counted among those.

'The trouble is…that you’re stymied if you don’t get that first rung through the GCSE process.’

Dr Claus, an ‘access’ fellow at Pembroke who champions initiatives to broaden the mix of undergraduates, said he originally achieved three O-levels but went ‘back into the education system’ to gain more qualifications.

‘You can’t really do that now,' he said.

But Dr Claus rejected a controversial proposal from a fellow speaker at the conference, Professor Patrick McGhee, who called for leading universities to apply a ‘systematic or blanket’ approach to admissions to increase their intake of disadvantaged pupils.

It would raise the prospect of applicants’ results being adjusted upwards according to various contextual factors, such as the overall performance of their school.

Professor McGhee, assistant vice-chancellor of the University of Bolton, said contextual data should be used ‘systematically despite the Russell Group saying that a systematic or blanket approach to the use of contextual data is problematic’.

But Dr Claus said the tactic could lead to ‘the barbarians…dancing on the table’.

‘The reason a systematic access weighting is problematic is it takes away autonomy from the academics,’ he said.

‘I’m not in favour of that because if you start down that road the barbarians will soon be dancing on the table, I’m really not interested in that.’

In advice to applicants on its website, Oxford says: ‘There is no absolute requirement for particular grades at GCSE, as there are no fixed examination results that must be attained for admission to Oxford University.

'Each application is considered carefully on its individual merits.

'When we look at GCSE results, we look at them in the context of the overall performance of the school or college where you studied. So if, for example, you didn’t get all A* and A grades, but your results were among the best in your year group, that will be taken into account.

‘However, competition for places is strong and many applicants have all A* and A grades at GCSE. Unless there are particular extenuating circumstances, we could not be optimistic of an applicant’s chances of gaining a place at Oxford without a high percentage of A* and A grades at GCSE.’
