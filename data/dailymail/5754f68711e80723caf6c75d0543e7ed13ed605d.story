Both Wednesday night Champions League ties will be refereed by English officials as Martin Atkinson takes charge of Schalke vs Real Madrid, while Mark Clattenburg covers Basle vs Porto.

The two appointments show UEFA's continued belief that English referees are among Europe's finest officials.

Atkinson has refereed three games in the Champions League this season: Bayer Leverkusen vs Benfica, Juventus vs Olympiakos and Barcelona vs Paris Saint-Germain. He also covered the Serbia vs Albania Euro 2016 qualifier which was abandoned after a drone flew a flag over the pitch.
