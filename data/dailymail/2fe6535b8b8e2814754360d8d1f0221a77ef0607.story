Thousands of North Korean labourers are working 18 hours a day to build Qatar's football world cup infrastructure while their wages are directly siphoned off to fund Kim Jong-Un's regime.

The men, who are told they've been awarded the privilege of serving the dictator abroad, must meet strict criteria in order to be eligible to work overseas.

This includes showing loyalty to the dictator's political party, having money to bribe migrant officials, and having a wife and children in order to dissuade defection.

North Korean labourers are working from 6am to midnight in Qatar (pictured) as they build infrastructure for the country's hosting of the 2022 Football World Cup

The conditions the men work under has been described as a modern form of slavery - they start work at 6am and do not finish until midnight - working under the illusion their pay will be available to collect when they return home,The Guardian reported.

The Qatar government said there were 2,800 North Koreans registered to work on Qatar's Lusail City.

To be finished in time for the 2022 Football World Cup, it will be home to more than a quarter of a million residents and be capable of hosting tens of thousands more at its array of luxury hotels.

It is formed by four islands and includes two luxury marinas - they will include a giraffe zoo, a snow park and a Six Flags amusement park, light rail network, two golf courses and a 86,000 seat stadium with a solar powered cooling system.

However, the manner by which this stunning architectural design is achieved remains dogged by accusations the nation is using an army of modern day slaves.

The Guardian reported one worker said he was paid nothing - with all earnings going back to North Korea where he believed he would be reimbursed upon his return.

A more senior worker said he was paid the equivalent of £250 a month and the rest would be available for him to collect when he returned home.

Choi Yunchul, a North Korean defector, told the paper: 'In the early 90s, workers did receive their salary but it has been stopped since the mid-90s. The construction company that employed workers sent all the money directly to the North Korean government's bank account.'

Accusations that labourers are being poorly paid and badly treated have plagued the country's world cup preparations. Pictured is the country's capital, Doha

Aidan McQuade, Anti-Slavery International director, said the conditions under which the labourers were working constituted slave labour.

He said: 'It is simply a further dreadful indictment of the dictatorship in Pyongyang, which exploits the vulnerability of its citizens to enrich itself in collusion with the Qatari autocracy.'

Qatar's drive to construct stadiums and infrastructure capable of hosting a massive international event such as the world cup has been dogged by scandals.

Only late last month was it was forced to refute claims that money for British firms working on the World Cup venues was being siphoned off to ISIS extremists.

The Commons was told British firms awarded contracts for the project in Qatar were being short-changed while some of the unpaid cash had ended up in the hands of the Islamic extremists in Syria.

But Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani told MailOnline it was a ’serious allegation’ which the government ’refutes completely’.

He said: ’Let me be clear, for the avoidance of doubt, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Middle East and around the world to face down the terrorist threat.’
