David Cameron has insisted he will not resign if Scotland votes to quit the United Kingdom in two weeks’ time.

The Prime Minister said it would ‘break my heart’ if the 307-year-old union were to end – but stressed it was ‘absolutely right’ to give Scottish  voters the chance to leave.

The pro-union No campaign has seen its lead slip from 22 percentage points to just six in the past month.

David Cameron, visiting a school in Wales, today insisted he will not resign if Scotland votes for independence, as Ed Miliband told Labour voters in Lanarkshire that the Tories are already on the way out

Sir Bob Geldof has urged Scotland to reject independence, saying nationalism is a ‘very dangerous political animal’.

The Live Aid organiser added: ‘I know this – I’m Irish. It’s a cheap 
political trick which twists the understanding of who we are.

‘I 
understand the emotional impulse towards independence. But always 
consider “independence” in inverted commas, because what the f*** does 
it mean? We are entirely dependent on one another. None of us, in our 
private lives or our political constructs, are ever independent.’

Last night it was rumoured that 
nationalists have seen private polling data that puts them in the lead 
for the first time in more than year.

On a visit to Scotland yesterday, Mr  
Miliband announced Labour would draft in party heavyweights including 
Lord Prescott for a last-ditch campaigning blitz next week. Gordon Brown
 will also appear in a joint rally with Mr Miliband.

The Labour 
leader, who has 41 MPs in Scottish seats, admitted he is under pressure 
after polls showed that up to a third of his party’s supporters back 
independence.

Critics said he had only made a handful of visits north of
 the border, despite a pledge earlier this summer that there was ‘no 
bigger priority’ than keeping Scotland in the union.

Appearing in  
Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, where party founder Keir Hardie was born, 
Mr  Miliband said: ‘I think for lots of people who have been here ... 
they have seen me many, many times in the last couple of months. I have 
been here a lot. And I will continue to be here a lot. I’ve been a very 
big and engaged part of this campaign.’

Mr Miliband used at the  Blantyre miners community resource centre in Scotland to make a series of pledges in a bid to shore up the No vote

The Labour leader urged voters not to think independence was the only way to 'get rid of this Tory government'

Britain could face a eurozone-style currency crisis if Scotland votes for independence, leading bankers have warned.

Goldman Sachs said a Yes vote 'could have severe consequences' for both Scotland and the rest of the UK.

It cited the rush to withdraw money from Greece and Spain, which led to economic turmoil and mass unemployment.

Kevin Daly, a senior economist at the firm, said the Bank of England could be forced to use taxpayers' money to prop up the pound within hours of a Yes vote. Even this would not prevent 'negative consequences', he added.

The prospect of Scottish independence saw sterling approach a five-month low this week, after polls showed the No campaign's lead had dropped significantly.

Mr Daly warned: 'Even if the sterling monetary union does not break up in the event of a Yes vote, the threat of a break-up would provide investors with a strong incentive to sell Scottish-based assets, and households with a strong incentive to withdraw deposits from Scottish-based banks.

'The most important specific risk, in our view, is that the uncertainty over whether an independent Scotland would be able to retain sterling as its currency could result in a [Europe-style] currency crisis occurring within the UK.'

Last month, former Tory 
leadership contender David Davis said a Yes vote would be such a 
‘humiliation’ to Mr Cameron that he would have to consider stepping 
down.

Michael Portillo has also claimed the Prime Minister would face 
‘tremendous pressure’ to leave Downing Street.

However, Mr Cameron told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It’s very important to say no to that emphatically.

‘What’s
 at stake here is not this prime minister or that prime minister, or 
this party leader or that party leader ... what is at stake is the 
future of Scotland.

'It’s a  desperately important question, I care 
passionately about it. It would break my heart if Scotland were to leave
 the United Kingdom.’

He said it had been ‘absolutely right’ to 
agree to the referendum, adding: ‘Scotland voted for a Scottish National
 Party whose policy was to hold a referendum.

'Now, if the British 
Government, led by me, had said “you’re not having a referendum”, that 
would have been a disastrous approach and would only have made Scottish 
independence more likely.’

First Minister Alex Salmond, who 
yesterday celebrated ten years in charge of the SNP for a second time, 
said he would not step down if Scotland votes No.

Asked if he would 
hand the reins to his deputy Nicola Sturgeon, he said: ‘No, we’ll 
continue to serve out the mandate we’ve been given and that applies to 
me, it applies to all of us.

'But I don’t think there’s any reason to 
expect we’ll be in that position – we’re far more likely to be seeing a 
substantial and decisive Yes vote.’

Two City grandees have criticised Mr
 Salmond for threatening to renege on Scotland’s share of UK debt if it 
becomes  independent and is not allowed to keep the pound.

First Minister Alex Salmond, touring Glasgow today, insisted Labour voters were turning their back on Westminster politics

Posing with Yes campaigners and Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (right), Mr Salmond hailed the 'once-in-a-lifetime' opportunity of independence with polls showing he is on the up

During his campaign visit, Mr Salmond signed a sofa where voters have been posting messages about independence

Former 
Bank of England deputy governor Sir Andrew Large and the former chairman
 of Prudential Sir Martin Jacomb said: ‘The threat to walk away from 
[Scotland’s] fair share of liabilities, an attempt to make reneging on 
the debt seem like a good idea, is shabby and in no one’s interest.

'For 
the rest of the UK it would leave a grudge, and would hardly be a 
sensible place to start a new relationship.’

They described the 
‘apparent attraction’ of such a course as ‘illusory’, and argued it 
would drive up borrowing costs for Scottish homeowners.

‘People 
considering whether to lend to Scotland, or invest in its debt, would 
remember the refusal to pay, and would want a higher interest rate to 
compensate for the risk of repetition,’ they warned.

The pair accused
 Mr Salmond of ‘confusing the public’ with ‘inaccurate’, ‘untrue’ and 
‘distorted non sequiturs’ in an open letter to The Scotsman newspaper.
