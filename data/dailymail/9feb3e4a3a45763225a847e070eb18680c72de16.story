German consumer goods company Henkel has caused a stink with its brand of toilet freshener after Ukrainians complained that it resembled their national flag.

The yellow-and-blue Bref Duo Stick freshener has been removed from sale in eastern Europe after a TV advertisement aired on a Russian channel was seen in neighbouring Ukraine.

The advert shows the freshener that looks like the flag being put under the toilet rim.

Insulting: The toilet cleaning product bore a striking resemblance to the Ukrainian national flagÂ 

Offensive: A yellow-and-blue Bref Duo Stick freshener caught the attention of Ukrainians for all the wrong reasons this week

Tore Birol, Henkel's general manager for 
laundry and home care products in Ukraine, said yesterday that the
company had pulled the product within three days of the 
complaints.

He said: 'We are very sorry if people were offended by the design of our new product'

Mr Birol explained that the freshener was coloured yellow to represent its lemon scent and blue to symbolise water and hygiene.

Spot the difference: The Ukrainian flag, left, and the tactless cleaning product, right

'A delirious idea from uncultured people,' one angry person commented on the YouTube clip.

Disrespect towards the Ukrainian flag has become a topical problem as earlier this month authorities found that Jared Hasselhoff, a bassist for American band Bloodhound Gang, had urinated on their flag during a gig in Kiev.

A criminal probe has since been launched against him and Hasselhoff has been banned from visiting the country for five years.
