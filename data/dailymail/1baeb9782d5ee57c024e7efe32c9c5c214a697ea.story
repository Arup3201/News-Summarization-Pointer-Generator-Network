This is the moment that ram-raiders used their car to smash their way into the headquarters of Formula 1 team Red Bull 

Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner branded the theft at around 1.30am on December 6, 'a pointless crime.' 

The ram-raiders escaped with haul of around 60 trophies after crashing through the team's glass display cabinet.

During the footage one of the raiders is even seen throwing throwing one of the trophies on to the floor. 

At the time of the raid a source close to the team revealed that many of the trophies were made of plastic and of no value.

This meant that the thieves were not able to melt them down or sell them for scrap metal.  

The crooks reversed their Mercedes vehicles, using foreign number plates, to reverse through the entrance

Around 20 of the trophies were recovered after a member of the public spotted them dumped in Horseshoe Lake near Sandhurst, Berkshire. 

Officers from Thames Valley Police are due to make an appeal for information about the break-in on BBC1's Crimewatch programme tonight.

Mr Horner, who is engaged to former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, said: 'It was a pointless crime, the value of which for these trophies is minimal in terms of raw material.

A total of six masked men were behind the early morning break-in at the factory 

'But the emotional value is huge and it would be great to see those trophies back in their rightful home in Milton Keynes.'

 The Austrian team won the F1 constructors’ championship and drivers’ title from 2010 to 2013, while Sebastian Vettel won the drivers' championship for each of the four years.

However the ram raiders, who used vehicles with foreign number plates, failed to get away with these trophies  as they had been passed on to this season's title winners Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton.

Red Bull staff were said to have been “absolutely devastated” by the theft of the trophies following years of work.

Mr Horner has previously warned that the team would have to limit access to the site in future, accepting the move would disappoint fans.

He said at the time: 'The actions of these men mean it's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future, which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our Formula One car.

'We would like to appeal to anyone who knows any information on the whereabouts of these trophies or the offenders involved to contact Thames Valley Police.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact Thames Valley Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
