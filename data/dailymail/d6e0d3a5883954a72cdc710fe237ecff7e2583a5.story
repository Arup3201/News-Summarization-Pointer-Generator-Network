Prince George of Cambridge is expected to live up to eight years longer than babies born in other parts of the country on the same day, new figures show.

Newborns in Westminster, home of St Mary’s Hospital where the prince was delivered on Monday, have a life expectancy of 81.2 years compared to just 73.8 years in Blackpool.

The dramatic difference in life chances was laid bare by the Office for National Statistics, which warned of a ‘north-south divide’ in the chance of reaching old age.

Latest data released today shows male life expectancy at birth was highest in East Dorset at 83 years in 2009-2011, an incredible 9.2 years higher than in Blackpool.

In Kensington and Chelsea, where William and Kate plan to have their family home in Kensington Palace, baby boys are predicted to live to 81.6 years.

The Cambridges were safely tucked away in
a small cottage in Kensington Palace's grounds today, with the only 
sign of movement this morning being a royal protection officer walking 
their dog Ludo nearby.

Prince George spent his first night at home after a dramatic evening where the waiting world had its first wonderful glimpse of him.

Bucklebury, in West Berkshire, where 
new grandparents Carole and Michael Middleton have a £4.8million 
Georgian mansion, has a life expectancy of 80.7 years for baby boys.

By
comparison areas in the north have much lower life expectancy, 
including 74.1 years in Manchester, 75.6 years in Salford and Burnley 
and 75.7 in Blackburn and Liverpool.

'The distribution of life expectancy in England was characterised by a north-south divide, with life expectancy generally being lower among local areas in the north of the country,' the ONS said.

For females, life expectancy at birth was also highest in East Dorset at 86.4 years and lowest in Manchester where females could expect to live for 79.3 years.

'These differences were statistically significant,' the ONS added.

Life expectancy for baby girls ranged from 86.4 years in East Dorset to the lowest in Manchester where females could expect to live for 79.3 years

In 2009-11, the difference in male life expectancy between the highest and lowest figures stood at 9.2 years and 7.1 years for baby girls, but there had not been a significant changer since 2005–07.

However in some areas life expectancy has fallen. In Rushmoor, Hampshire male life expectancy fell by 0.2 years but rose by 2.9 years in Camden.

For baby girls the greatest improvement was in Hartlepool where life expectancy has risen by three years but in Rutland it fell by 0.8 years.
