A formerly obese man has admitted joining his local slimming club was one of the best things he's ever done. Not only has it improved his health, it has also transformed his love life as he met his wife-to-be at the weekly meetings.  

Rob Poulton, 53, from Dudley, West Midlands, said he had given up hope of ever finding love before he joined Weight Watchers last year. 

He signed up for their weekly weighs-in and followed their diet plan after his GP told him he could die if he did not lose weight.

Found love: Kerry and Rob met at the slimming group, originally bonding over weight-loss tips 

It was at the meetings that he met Kerry Cadman, 42, from Rowley Regis, after she asked for his tips on dieting.

Rob, a full-time carer, said: 'Joining the group has been one of the best things I have done. I hadn't had a relationship for 27 years, and had given up hope to tell the truth.'

Recalling how he met Kerry, he explained: 'Kerry said she was having trouble losing weight and asked if we could meet for a coffee to talk about it.

'I had been in the group for around a year before I even spoke to her. I was very shy when I joined, I saw it was a room full of women so I just sat at the back and kept quiet.'

Since then the pair have lost 12st 5lb between them and last month Rob popped the question.  

Rob's battle with the bulge started when he was 18 and he got a job in a bakery. Surrounded by tempting treats, he would snack on cakes daily and even started eating cream straight from the spout.

When he tipped the scales at 22st 12lb, his doctor warned him he was a borderline diabetic and on the verge of a serious liver disease.

It was then Rob knew he had to take action and joined his local Weight Watchers group in February last year. As a result of following their advice, he shed 9st 1lb in 18 months.

He ditched his old diet of takeaway curries in favour of fresh fruit and vegetables and shrunk from a 50in waist to 34in. 

Slimmed down: Kerry, who was 15st (left) is now enjoying her new figure, weighing 11st 10lb (right)

Down on one knee: Rob proposed to Kerry last month at their Weight Watcher's meeting hall (left) and the newly slimmed down pair hope to tie the knot next year

After sticking to the same plan and with the support of her husband-to-be, Kerry lost 3st 4lb. 

She was 15st when she joined and is now 11st 10lb. 

She said before she met Rob, she struggled to shift the extra pounds after snacking every day on chocolate and crisps.

She initially claimed free check-ins at the club by running their shop selling Weight Watchers products.

It was only when she decided to sit in on the classes that she met Rob and finally was able to slim down from a size 20 to a svelte 14.

The grandmother-of-two said: 'We started going for coffees and it just went from there. I found he was a nice person, he is very thoughtful.

'I have always struggled with my weight, I was a yo-yo dieter, I always struggled to keep the weight off.

'But then Rob came into my life, he has just always been there for me, kept me strong when I was struggling and that meant I could keep going.'

Exercise convert: Rob's waist has shrunk from a 50in  to 34in and he now cycles 40 to 50 miles a week

Shared success: Rob (left receiving a Gold Certificate from Weight Watchers) and Kerry supported each other through their weight loss journey

As well as following a healthy diet, Rob is now also an exercise convert. He cycles 40 to 50 miles a week, is a regular on the golf course, and goes to the gym at least twice a week.

In August he did a 40 mile cycle ride to raise nearly £600 for the Acorns Children's Hospice, which has a centre in Walsall.
