All state schools, including primaries, will be forced to teach sex education under Liberal Democrat plans to be announced today.

Nick Clegg’s Schools Minister David Laws will commit the party to introducing sex education for all children aged seven and over to help them become ‘good citizens’.

The move, backed by Labour but opposed by the Conservatives, would force thousands of schools to increase the amount of sex education on offer.

Most state comprehensives already offer sex education as part of the national curriculum.

But thousands of academies, free and faith schools are not required to teach the national curriculum, meaning they are free to drop the subject.

Provision in primary schools is also patchy, with most not teaching anything until the final years.

Critics of the move say sex education should be left to parents. They warn that much of the teaching in schools uses explicit material that is inappropriate for young children.

But Mr Laws will say that sex education should be a central part of any rounded education, comparable to young people learning how to manage their money.

He will say: ‘We believe that by educating children about sex and relationships in an appropriate way, we can help them to make informed choices in their personal lives.’

The Lib Dems want to reduce the age for sex education from 11 to seven. Although parents will retain the right to pull children under 15 out of sex education lessons, many do not know about the option and it is little used.

Several attempts have been made to introduce compulsory sex education since the election but all have been blocked by Tory ministers, who argue schools should be free to decide with parents what they teach without undue government interference.

The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said sex education should be left to parents.

But supporters say too many children are leaving school without proper knowledge of sex and relationships.

An Opinium survey of 18-year-olds found 86 per cent said sex and relationship advice should be taught in schools.

Nick Clegg went barefoot and wore traditional headgear yesterday on a visit to a Sikh temple during a trade mission to India.

It is customary to remove your shoes at the Bangla Sahib Gurudwara in New Delhi and to cover your head.

The Deputy Prime Minister also helped stir vegetables in the temple’s community kitchen.

Mr Clegg later held talks with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on the prospect of bringing top teachers from the UK to India and of British experts helping to clean up the Ganges.

The delegation, including Mr Clegg’s unpaid India business adviser Lord Dholakia, hope to forge deals in aerospace, retail and science.
