A 29 year old first-time mother diagnosed with incurable bowel cancer has vowed to defy her doctors and beat the disease so she can take her daughter to her first day at kindergarten. 

On Boxing Day 2014, just three months after giving birth to her beautiful daughter Charlotte, Kate Vincent, from Newcastle in NSW, was told the killer disease was 'advanced' and had large clusters of tumours in her liver and lungs.

Distraught and shocked, the young mum fleetingly let her mind wander about the worst case scenario but seven weeks on, Kate told Daily Mail Australia that she was now determined to fight the illness head on, and letting it win just wasn't an option.

'In the really low moments it crushes your mind and I think it would be abnormal if I didn't (think about the worst),' Kate said. 

Her husband, Nathan, has been her rock through the tough times along with her amazing support group of family and friends and she believes that they are the reason she is willing to fight this battle.

'I'm not going anywhere and I was given this (cancer) for a reason and that reason is to find that other part of myself that I didn't know existed. The fight is on.' she said.

With no symptoms and a newborn baby to look after, Kate, who is on maternity leave from her job as a teacher, ignored a lump under her ribs, putting it down to the effects her pregnancy and labour had on her body.

'I just thought it’s hormones and it’s my body changing and getting back into shape after I’d had my baby,' she said. 

'It just so happened that I took my baby to the doctor because I thought she had a little bit of a cold and while I was there I asked my GP to feel the lump and she said "That’s your liver, we might get that checked out".'

Kate wasn't worried throughout her following CT scan on Christmas Eve, never allowing herself to think that the lump may turn out to be cancer.

The diagnosis came as a huge shock to her and her husband but she says she was 'lucky in a way' that the tumour had spread to her liver as she would never have known about the bowel cancer if those lumps were not showing. She also said it has raised awareness that the disease can strike at any stage and doesn't just happen 'to 70-year-old men'.

'There have been so many messages from people who I've never met before and it’s overwhelming how it’s touched a lot of people because I think they don’t realise that this can happen to a 29-year-old.' the mother said.

However, there was worse news to come, as a week after being told the devastating news that she had an 8cm tumour in her liver, her doctor gave her the dreadful news that it was incurable

However, there was worse news to come, as a week after being told the devastating news that she had an 8cm tumour in her liver, her doctor gave her the dreadful news that it was incurable.

'When I found out that it was cancer and that it was bowel cancer and that it had spread to the liver I was distraught and it was horrible,' she said. 

'It was probably about a week and half after that I was told it was incurable. 

Kate said she can't describe the feeling of being told you may die from cancer, however after coming to terms with her doctor's diagnosis, she is positive she can overcome the illness.   

'It was very surreal because you are thinking positively the whole time and to hear that it's incurable I can’t really describe what it was like,' the mother-of-one said, 

'I'm feeling very positive and I think my doctor would like me to prove him wrong.'

While dealing with the fact that she may never see her daughter take her first steps, Kate had to take care of her three-month-old baby. Charlotte, who is now over five-months-old, is the reason Kate has adopted an optimistic approach to her treatment. 

'Luckily we've been blessed with a very settled and beautiful baby who does all the right things at the right time so we’re very lucky in that way,' she said. 

'She’s wonderful. We have got so much family and friends support around us which is really handy.

'On the days that I'm not feeling wonderful I've got so much family support around that they can take Charlotte and look after her while I recover myself.' 

Kate has already had two rounds of chemotherapy and has six left, with her third round of treatment starting tomorrow. She admits that she's been fine with her therapy and has had no side effects yet. 

'Physically I feel fine so that makes it a hell of a lot easier to be positive about everything.'

For now, Kate is in the middle of launching a support group for mothers who are diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses. She believes it's important for women to talk about what might happen 'if I don't get to see them start kindergarten and how that feels for everybody else'. 

'It's very difficult for  friends to relate to where I'm coming from. There is nothing out there for young mums,' Kate said. 

'To be told that I may not see her grow up, I don’t think that people who aren't in that situation can quite fathom what that must be like for me. I don’t want it to be a big sob story but I think it’s really important to talk to people who are in the same boat.'

A Mycause page called Something For Kate set up by her best friend's husband has already raised over $46,000 for Kate and Bowel Cancer Australia

A Mycause page called Something For Kate set up by her best friend's husband has already raised over $48,000 for Kate and Bowel Cancer Australia. 

Kate requested that 60 percent of the money be given to charity and the remaining 40 percent to her and her family. 

'That’s been a really overwhelming part of it. The response has been very overwhelming and obviously you realise that it brings out the best in people I suppose when they realise that something like this is going on,' she said. 

'It can kind of scare people into thinking it could happen to them. It’s been great because it has really raised the awareness for people and it’s out there now. We’re getting a lot of responses from people realising that it is a disease that can affect people at any age.'

Initially when the funding page was set up, just looking at the comments upset Kate, reminding her of the long road ahead of her. However, the messages of support now provide her with some much needed comfort in her dark times.  

'The message of support have been the thing that I really hold on to. While it may make me cry every time I thought about it, holding on to those lovely words has really given me a lot to hold on to in my times that I'm not feeling very positive.'
