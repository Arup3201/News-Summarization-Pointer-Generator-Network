Rachel McIntyre, pictured leaving court,was seen holding the infant by his ankles before dropping him on the floor

A drunk former nurse fractured a baby's skull when she dropped him head-first on to the pavement after picking him up by his ankles, a court heard.

Rachel McIntyre, Edgemoor Park, Balloch, near Inverness had taken the four-month-old, who she was looking after last June, with her on a trip to the local shop to buy vodka.

Inverness Sheriff Court was told that McIntyre, 38, had taken the baby out in a pushchair when residents in the Kinymlies area of Inverness heard the sound of a distressed baby.

Fiscal depute Roderick Urquhart said: 'They looked out of their garden and saw she was holding the baby by his ankles over her left shoulder and had her other hand on the pushchair.

'One of the witnesses turned to his wife and said: 'She is going to drop the wain.'

'They then saw her drop the baby and he fell on to the road surface. It seems that McIntyre phoned an ambulance. 'The witnesses said she was 'out of it.'

The infant was rushed to hospital where doctors found he had sustained an 11cm fracture of the left side of its skull. 

'The baby spent a few days in hospital,' added Mr Urquhart. 'The child has since made a full recovery.'

When interviewed by police, McIntyre denied holding the baby by the ankles and dropping him, claiming the child had fallen out of the pushchair and 'bounced' the court heard.

McIntyre later admitted the wilful ill-treatment of the child while under the influence of alcohol on Lawers Way in Inverness on June 16 last year.

Defence lawyer Duncan Henderson said it was unlikely his client, who had previously struggled with alcohol, would be able to return to nursing.

He said: 'She had been a nurse and was well thought of by her colleagues. The likelihood is that she will no longer be allowed to practice as a result of this offence.

'She has struggled with alcohol in the past and did very well to get back to practising professionally. 'But in 2014 she suffered a triple whammy. One of her two sons was diagnosed with epilepsy, her father was seriously injured in a road accident and she had a premature baby.

'She found it difficult to cope and turned to alcohol again. When I met her in the cells the following day, her first question was: 'How's the wee boy?' 

'She has not been drinking since and has been receiving help and treatment. She is very contrite and knows she was wrong.'

McIntyre was spared jail and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. 

She refused to comment after the case.
