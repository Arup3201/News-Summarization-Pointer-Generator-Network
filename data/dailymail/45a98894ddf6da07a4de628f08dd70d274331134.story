A New York news anchor has advised his viewers not to eat infected mucus or feces they find in subway cars if they want to avoid catching Ebola.

Errol Louis, the host of Inside City Hall on NY1, offered the advice to his audience in the wake of Dr Craig Spencer being diagnosed as the first Ebola sufferer in New York.

Speaking on his show Thursday night, he said: 'People are wondering about methods of transmission... You have to come into intimate contact with it while the person is infected.'

'If you came across some strange mucus or feces or something out there on the subway, the street or anything else - don't eat it!

'Don't let it get into your body, don't touch it,' he continued.

The light-hearted recommendation echoed the sentiments of public health officials, who have said repeatedly that Ebola only spreads via bodily fluids, and is not easily contracted.

Officials including Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York governor Andrew Cuomo have said New Yorkers should not alter their daily lives in the wake of the first Ebola case, despite concern that Dr Spencer went jogging, ate in restaurants and rode the subway while feeling ill.

Nine people have been treated for confirmed cases of Ebola on American soil thus far. Only one, Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan, has died.
