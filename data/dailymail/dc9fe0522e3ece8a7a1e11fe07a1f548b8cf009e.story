As dwelling values across the country continue to rise while rental rates struggle to keep up, RP Data has revealed how the capital cities compare with their rental yields for both houses and units.

The property analytics provider has predicted a continued compression in rental yields across the major cities, as the last 12 months have seen the average typical gross yield for houses fall from 4.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent.

RP Data reports that the only two cities where the rental yield has risen in the last year are Hobart and Adelaide, with 5.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent recorded respectively.

Darwin recorded the highest rental yields for both houses, 5.9 per cent, and units, 5.8 per cent

The city with the top rental yield, of 5.9 per cent, was Darwin.

Brisbane came in third place with 4.5 per cent, while Perth and Canberra had 4.1 per cent each.

Sydney and Melbourne, which are suffering from the greatest yield compression, recorded the lowest rental yields of 3.6 per cent and 3.2 per cent.

'Over the past year we have seen Sydney's gross rental yields fall by 47 basis points from 4.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent,' RP Data research director Tim Lawless said. 

'In Melbourne, where rental yields are even lower, we have seen gross yields fall by 32 basis points over the year to reach 3.2 per cent gross. 

Hobart had the second highest rental yield for houses at 5.2 per cent, and the third highest for units, also 5.2 per cent

'Given the current rate of value growth and moderate rental growth, it wont be long before Sydney yields have moved below Melbourne.

'With yields so low in the cities where values are seeing the largest capital gains, it is clear that investors remain very much focussed on value growth rather than yields.'

Darwin also recorded the highest rental yield for units at 5.8 per cent, followed closely by Brisbane with 5.4 per cent.

Sydney and Melbourne were again at the bottom of the list, recording 4.5 per cent and 4.2 per cent. 

This comes as the figures also showed house prices in Australian capital cities recorded their strongest gains in winter since 2007, increasing by 4.2 percent in the three months to the end of August. 

 The lift in capital gains was driven by Melbourne which recorded a 6.4 percent increase, beating Sydney which recorded a 5 percent increase.

Melbourne and Sydney were the only capital cities to record double-digit dwelling value growth over the past year.

Melbourne outperformed Sydney over winter but Sydney was the leader year-on-year, with house prices increasing 16.2 percent in Sydney compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.

All other capital cities trailed behind with Adelaide recording a 5.9 percent rise year-on-year, followed by Brisbane with 5.4 percent, Darwin with 5.4 percent, Perth with 3.5 percent, Hobart 2.8 percent and Canberra with 1.4 percent.

 RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were driving these two tier conditions.

He added that he expected dwelling values to increase again this Spring.

'Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months,' Mr Lawless said.

'Consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter.'
