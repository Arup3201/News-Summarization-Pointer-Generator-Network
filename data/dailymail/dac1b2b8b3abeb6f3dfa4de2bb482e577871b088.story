Premier League clubs are screening African football players who have returned from international matches for Ebola, amid the Ebola crisis on the continent.

Cheick Tiote, Papiss Cisse and Wilfried Bony are among the players who will be checked for the virus, after competing in African Nations Cup qualifiers.

It comes as health officials announce that airport screening for the killer disease, which was put in place at Heathrow earlier this week, will be extended to Manchester and Birmingham.

Swansea City's Wilfried Bony, who plays for Ivory Coast, will also be tested after competing in West Africa

Although no players have travelled back to the UK from the worst-affected parts of West Africa, the potential spread of the killer disease is being 'closely considered' by various club medics.

Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew said the club had a 'strategy' in place to closely monitor cup hopefuls Tiote and Cisse, who returned to Tyneside after representing the Ivory Coast and Senegal respectively.

Wilfried Bony, who plays for Swansea, will also be put through tests after returning from playing with the Ivory Coast, his club confirmed.

But Manchester City FC  said the club would 'not be engaging publicly in any discussion' about Yaya Touré and Ebola for patient confidentiality reasons.

A spokesman did confirm the Ivory Coast captain was back at the training ground yesterday.

Speaking about his two players, Pardew said: 'We'd be naive not to have concerns. We have a strategy for when they return and making sure they and their families are taken care of.

'They're essential to us and our doctor has looked into the problems that might arise and also protection for them and to make sure we do our very best to help them.' 

Midfielder Tiote has been in DR Congo with the Ivory Coast, while Cisse was with Senegal in Dakar this week. Neither country has an outbreak.

Pardew continued: 'The two boys who travelled to Africa are not back yet but reports are that they're both well. 

Manchester City FC has refused to say whether Yaya Touré - the Ivory Coast captain - was screened for the virus on return from the African continent 

'Of course it's a worry when you've got players such a long way away, you're just looking at your phone hoping no messages come thorough that are negative. We've been lucky this time around.' 

A spokesman for Swansea insisted the checks being given to Bony were no different to those given to all players returning from international games.

But he said the club was 'well aware' of the Ebola situation.  

He said: 'Out of our players, it is only Bony that has returned from Africa. The club is well aware of the situation, but the doctors are quite relaxed about it.  

'He will go through normal fitness checks and medical tests which any player returning from an international game would go through.'

A football source said yesterday that the Premier League was not 'particularly concerned' about any risk of the deadly virus being brought back.  

Manager Alan Pardew said Newcastle FC would be 'naive' not to take precautions following the Ebola outbreak

They said: 'Players are probably more closely monitored health-wise than any individuals in the country. They are surrounded by doctors and their levels are tested daily.

'It has crossed the minds of the Premier League and certainly club doctors, but none of the players have gone out to countries affected by Ebola - unless you count the US.' 

A Premier League also told MailOnline that it had not issued any advice on Ebola because guidance was already available from health officials. He said it was up to each individual club to decide how best to look after their players. 

West Ham United refused to comment on whether there were procedures in place for the return of Cheikhou Kouyaté, who represents Senegal. 

When asked about Senegal player Mohamed Diamé, who competed in the qualifiers, Hull City also said it would not comment.

Another player who is believed to have competed in international qualifiers in Africa include Sadio Mané from Southampton. The club was not available for comment. 

The returning players were competing in qualifiers for the Africa Cup of Nations, due to be held in Morocco in January.

There have been fears the competition could be postponed if the deadly virus is not contained, while Ghana also revealed it has been approached about staging the competition if Morocco withdraws. 

Health officials began screening arrivals at Heathrow on Wednesday. Downing Street said the regime is poised to be rolled out across Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal 

The screening techniques include a form  for passengers to fill in, asking about potential symptoms of the virus

The Ghanaian sports minister said he had been contacted by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which was also said to have been in touch with the South African Football Association.

Up to a million spectators are expected to travel to watch the African Cup of Nations.

Pardew added: 'That's something that will play out as we go along. That kind of decision is a big, big one and I'm sure the countries will make that rather than club managers.

'It's something to be concerned about and we have to be on our guard.'

Agents for Tiote and Cisse refused to comment. Agents for Toure and Bony were unavailable for comment.

Meanwhile, Sierra Leone midfielder Michael Lahoud, who plays in the US for Philadelphia Union, said team-mates from the national side had felt humiliated by their treatment by opponents.

Sierra Leone have been forced to play home African Cup of Nations qualifiers in neutral countries because of the Ebola outbreak.

He said rival fans chanted 'Ebola' at the team and some opponents refused to shake hands or swap shirts after the game.

Dele Adebola, the former Birmingham City and Coventry City striker, was last week forced to deny that he has  Ebola.

The Nigerian forward, who currently plays in the Northern Premier League for Rushall Olympic, had been constantly asked on Twitter if he had the disease by those who thought his name sounded similar to the deadly virus. 

After several tweets and jokes poking fun at his name, Adebola finally responded: 'Guys please stop asking if I have ebola.

'I do not have it. But I thank you for caring about my health and wellbeing :-) Dele.' 

He told BBC Sport: 'It is really causing a lot of tension and friction.'

He has not been involved with the national side this month as it is the climax of the MLS season in the US.  

On Wednesday, Public Health England began screening passengers arriving at Heathrow Terminal 1 after taking indirect flights from West Africa.

It is expected to roll out across Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras, London, next week. 

Public Health England announced the regime will then be implemented at Manchester and Birmingham, once measures at the other ports of entry have 'settled'.

In his weekly message to staff, Duncan Selbie said: 'Next week the focus will be on Gatwick and St Pancras and, once settled there, we will then move to include Manchester and Birmingham.

'I appreciate very much that we are taking people away from their normal work, and please be assured that we are thinking hard and listening carefully to those on the ground to see how we can make this more sustainable.

'What I am certain of is that we have the people who know how to keep the country safe and that is exactly what we will do.'

 The process involves being questioned to establish any potential exposure to the disease. The person also has their temperature taken.

They are then declared free to go, referred for further assessment, classed as low risk and sent away with information to monitor their own condition, or classed as higher risk and actively monitored.

Authorities were heavily criticised on the first day of screening at airports when it emerged checks were not compulsory and only those who 'show symptoms of the virus' were being spoken to. 

David Cameron, who yesterday chaired a meeting of the Government's Cobra contingencies committee on the outbreak, will use an EU summit in Brussels next week to push for more funding and assistance for the poverty-stricken countries which are struggling to contain outbreaks.

Mr Cameron has urged other European countries to introduce Ebola screening regimes at airports, warning they 'must do more' to halt the spread of the killer disease.

At Thursday's Cobra meeting the Prime Minister voiced doubts about the quality of protection in place in Europe, saying other governments should emulate the checks brought in by the UK.  

It is estimated the death toll from the Ebola crisis will rise to more than 4,500 lives this week from among 9,000 people infected by the deadly disease.

Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the World Health Organisation said the new numbers also show the outbreak is hitting health workers hard, with 2,700 infected and 236 dead.

She told reporters in Geneva that cases are doubling every four weeks, and the effects of the crisis are increasingly being felt beyond its epicentre in West Africa.
