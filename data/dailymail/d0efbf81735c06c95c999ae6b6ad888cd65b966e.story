The prints on these T-shirts certainly jump out at you.

The eye-catching tops feature extreme close-up shots of animal faces in 3D.

Fans can adorn their chests with a whole host of creatures' faces; from docile dogs to snarling bears and even a hairless cat.

The designers behind the quirky T-shirts began with dog prints, but branched out to other animals when the 3D shirts caught on.

Michael McGloin, from New Hampshire company The Mountain, said: 'A light bulb just went off and I realized this is what we had to do.'

Mr McGloin said the New Hampshire firm's tops had become a phenomenon.

'We needed to be the only player in 
the dog themed T-shirt market. Covering all of the top breeds to start 
with and then eventually moving onto all animals.'
