Nigel Pearson wants to solve Leicester goalscoring problems by signing Jermain Defoe from MLS side Toronto.

The former England striker, who has been at St George’s Park recovering from a groin injury over the past few weeks, wants to return to the Barclays Premier League.

His former manager Harry Redknapp also wants him at QPR and Hull chief Steve Bruce has also confirmed that he has an interest in the Toronto forward.

Leicester manager Nigel Person wants Jermain Defoe to help solve his side's goalscoring problems

Defoe, 32, left Tottenham for MLS last year, but the move has not been successful.

Leicester have offered the striker, who began his career with Charlton, a lifeline and may be the only team willing to fund the deal.

Toronto spent £6m on Defoe and increased his £70,000 a week wages when they signed him from White Hart Lane.

They want to recoup a substantial part of that to release him and few Premier League teams are willing to match the huge salary for a player of his age.

Defoe is a noted goalscorer and Leicester are desperate to find a solution to their issues up front after slipping to the foot of the table.

Pearson’s side have won only three games all season since they were promoted to the Premier League and are fighting for survival under their manager.

Pearson is hoping that Defoe's prolific record could help Leciester climb out the relegation zone

He wants Defoe to join Leicester, who beat Hull and drew with Liverpool over the festive period, to increase their chances of survival.

Redknapp is also in the market for a striker and has made it clear on a number of occasions that he wants to work with Defoe again.

But the figures to bring him back to London appear to be prohibitive and Redknapp may have to look elsewhere if they cannot match Leicester’s bid.

Defoe, who is closing in on fitness, wants his future resolved before the end of January and is determined to return to the Premier League.
