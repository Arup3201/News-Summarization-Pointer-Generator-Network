A man suffered an electric shock after lightning hit a terraced house yesterday and set off a fire in Scotland causing a massive power cut to nearby homes.

Richard Werner, 32, from Edinburgh got a severe electric shock after the lightning strike and could face a massive repair bill 
to replace electrical equipment damaged by the ‘act of God.’

He said: ‘It came out of nowhere. I was in 
the basement and I got a shock through my hand. The fire alarm went off,
 and all the lights were off. I ran up to check if my wife was okay.

The lightning bolt, which earthed on a 
terrace house in Pilrig Street, sent sparks raining down from the rooftop
 and caused power cuts to several homes in the area.

In one property, the aerial box exploded
 while walls were left scorched and blackened due to smoke when the 
strike ignited a fire.

Fire crews extinguished smouldering items in the house and police sealed off a section of the main road to allow emergency services to assess any damage. 

A total of 16 firefighters rushed to the scene following the lightning strike at 3.25pm on Friday. A

Mr Werner added: ‘There was smoke in the house and there were sparks flying down the back of the building.’

The musician had been standing on a plastic stool and touching a wooden cupboard when he got the shock.

‘Neither of them are good conductors - it must have come up from the floor after it grounded.’

His wife Louisa, 33, was upstairs with their terrier Banjo when she heard a ‘colossal bang’.

She
 said: ‘The bang shook the whole house. The electricity went off and the
 sparks came down the window at the back. There was a smell of burning. Smoke was coming out of the top of the house.’

Neighbour
 Gunter Feldt, 87, a former German POW and paratrooper, compared the 
strike to a World War Two bomb, adding that the noise was ‘absolutely 
unbelievable’.

He said: ‘I heard bombs during the war and it was much louder than a bomb. I have never experienced anything like it.

‘There
 was no thunderstorm, just a bolt of lightning from out of nowhere - and
 that was it.’
