This is the moment a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador was seized by police because the owner had forgotten to pay his vehicle tax.

The 217mph supercar was stopped by officers in West Bromwich, West Midlands, on Saturday night and database checks revealed the imported German car was not taxed for Britain’s roads.

But the 35-year-old owner, who lives and works in the UK, had his car returned after paying a £260 fine. He was pulled over as part of Operation Jessica, a project being carried out by six UK forces.

It gives police powers to order owners of foreign vehicles to tax, insure and register their cars in the UK or leave the country within 56 days. If they do not comply then their cars will be crushed.

Detectives estimate that up to 350,000 foreign registered vehicles entered Britain and overstayed the six-month exemption period without registering and licensing between 2010 and 2013.

The problem is said to cost the taxpayer £60million a year in lost tax revenue. West Midlands Police stated in November that 130 foreign vehicles had been seized in the first few weeks of its operation.

Superintendent Paul Keasey, from the force, said: ‘The DVLA has provided us with a “hot list” of vehicles that have entered the country and stayed longer than permitted without licensing it here.

‘We are actively targeting these vehicles and making stops on other foreign cars to check they are complying.

‘It’s the responsibility of every driver, no matter where they come from, to ensure they obey the UK road laws and that includes falling in line with on taxation, registration and insurance, as well as those on safe driving.

‘This initiative allows us to deal more effectively with criminality on our roads, thereby increasing our communities’ safety and security.’

The Aventador can accelerate from 0 to 62mph  in 2.9 seconds and comes with a powerful 6.5-litre V12 engine. A Top Gear review described it as having 'bodywork that scares small children'.

The 700bhp vehicle, which can achieve 17.6mpg, costs between £242,000 and £295,000 - which is about 1,000 times the value of the fine given to the driver in West Bromwich.
