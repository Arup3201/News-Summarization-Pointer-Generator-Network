Lloyds last night dashed hopes that it will curb excessive bonuses,saying that it would not be reforming its pay structure in the ‘foreseeable future’.

Expectations were raised after it  emerged that the state backed lender has mooted plans to ban annual bonus payments for top staff in the wake of the investor backlash against boardroom greed.

Its remuneration committee has been discussing a series of proposals to change the way it dishes out windfalls.

Options include ditching annual bonus payments and extending the timeframe for share payouts – called long-term incentive plans – from three to ten years. This would tie the awards of directors to the long-term performance of the company and help clampdown on reckless behaviour.

But last night it appeared to distance itslef from the proposals.

 ‘We keep our remuneration plans under review at all times but have no current plans to change our structures and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.’

Deborah Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘It’s a shame that the first radical thinking to come out of the banks for five years has been rebuffed. We urgently need one of the banks to have the courage set an example.’

While rivals, including Barclays and Citigroup, faced a pay rebellion in the so-called shareholder spring, Lloyds escaped a bruising at this year’s annual showdown with investors in May. But the issue of pay is particularly toxic at a state-backed bank.

Lloyds and RBS are already banned from paying cash bonuses of more than £2,000. Loyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio also defused pressure by waiving his £2.4m bonus for last year.

But his pay package - worth up to £6.9m a year – has come under intense criticism.

News of the proposed reforms emerged as the incoming financial watchdog warned it would dish out early fines to clamp down on wrongdoing.

The Prudential Regulation Authority said enforcement action would no soon longer be used merely as a last resort and that it would consider taking enforcement action at ‘an early stage’.

The PRA will be one of two watchdogs taking over from the Financial Services Authority next April.

It will supervise banks to ensure they are being run safely while the Financial Conduct Authority will seek to protect consumers against mis-selling.

Blob: The FSA is unlikely to publish its report into the failure of HBOS until the Summer at the earliest, it emerged yesterday.

The news is a another blow to both shareholders and taxpayers who have suffered indirectly from the reckless lending of HBOS before the credit crunch.
