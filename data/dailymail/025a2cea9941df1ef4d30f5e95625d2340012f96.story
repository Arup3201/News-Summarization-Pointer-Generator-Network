Top table tennis players often return ping pong balls at speeds of more than 100mph (161km/h).

By their very nature, the ping pong balls are light and paddles are sturdy, but when fired at supersonic speeds, the whole dynamic changes. 

An air-powered bazooka has been designed that can fire the little white balls with so much power, they travel as fast as an F-16 fighter jet, with dramatic consequences for paddles that get in the way.

Now that's a smash: A ping pong ball travelling at around 400 metres a second (Mach 1.2) hits a wooden paddle, travelling straight through it. This video is made in slow motion

Unveiled last year, the air bazooka is made from cheap materials such as plastic tubing and duct tape.

It can fire ping pong balls as fast as 400 metres a second or Mach 1.2.

Fighter jets typically cruise at Mach 1.

The machine is so powerful because it uses a pressure chamber connected to a vacuum tube via a ‘convergent-divergent nozzle’.

The hourglass-shaped nozzle is similar to what is used in fighter jets.

When the pressured air rushes through the bottleneck it accelerates to supersonic speed as it helps propel the ball through the clear PVC barrel, its inventor explained.

The light-weight ping pong balls fired from the gun can bore through wooden paddles, aluminium and even dent steel.

John Huhn, from the Department of 
Engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, captured the 
destruction of one paddle in slow motion, to show what happens when a lightweight ball meets a wooden paddle at supersonic speeds.

The action can be seen in the video at 30,000 frames per second,The Blaze reported.

In February last year, engineers from the university revealed their deadly weapon – an air-powered bazooka – that fires balls at more than 400 metres a second, or about Mach 1.2.

The machine was created by an aeronautical engineer for the U.S. Air Force, Mark French with help from his graduate students at the university, Craig Zehrung and Jim Stratton.

The team made the machine - that can blast balls clean though plywood or aluminium and deeply dent steel - using materials including plastic tubing and duct tape.

Despite the low-tech materials, the machine can fire balls that break the sound barrier and can hit 919mph (1,479kph).

The machine is so powerful because it uses a pressure chamber connected to a vacuum tube via a ‘convergent-divergent nozzle’.

Dr French explained: ‘That hourglass-shaped nozzle is similar to what is used in fighter jets. When the pressurised air rushes through the bottleneck it accelerates to supersonic speed as it helps propel the ball through the clear PVC barrel.’

It is surprising that the lightweight balls - weighting just 0.08oz (2.3g) - can reach supersonic speeds because they have poor aerodynamics. 

  
Hole in one: Fired at close range, the ping pong ball blasts a hole through a traditional paddle at speeds of around 919mph (1,479kph)

Supersonic: The ping-pong ball fired by the researchers at their lab in Indiana achieved speeds comparable to that of an F16 jet (pictured) racing across the landscape

But they can deliver enough energy to blast through targets equivalent to a brick falling from a tall building.

‘There is not enough money you could give me to get me to step in front of that gun,’ he said.

The scientists explained that the ping pong gun is a popular tool for demonstrating acceleration and the power of pressure differentials in air when explaining concepts in physics lectures.

'It has even proven to be a challenging problem for computational fluid dynamics since it encompasses a range of aerodynamic phenomena that are particularly difficult to model,' Dr French said.
