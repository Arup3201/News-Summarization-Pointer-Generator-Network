A woman wearing the Google Glass while driving in San Diego, California, was fined by police for wearing the smart device while operating a vehicle.

Cecilia Abadie, a Google Glass explorer, was pulled over on Tuesday and given a ticket, which she promptly uploaded on Google Plus.

Her violation was ‘driving w/monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)’.

Illegal: Abadie's violation was 'driving w/monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)', according to the ticket, which she posted on Google Plus

The law prohibits drivers from operating vehicles if ‘a television receiver, a video monitor, or a television or video screen, or any other similar means of visually displaying a television broadcast or video signal that produces entertainment or business applications, is operating and … visible to the driver’, according to International Business Times.

The law exempts GPS devices, parking assist camera monitors, and ‘interlocking’ devices that automatically disable when the vehicle is in motion.

Google Glass is a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display that is being developed by Google with a mission of producing a mass-market product, which displays information in a smartphone-like hands-free format, and which can communicate with the internet via natural language voice commands.

The Explorer Edition is available to testers and Google I/O developers in the United States for $1,500, while a consumer version is expected to be available in 2014.

Abadie, who is a self-confessed ‘geek and Google Glass pioneer’, has received many support messages since the incident, some suggesting she challenge the ticket.

A fellow Glass Explorer, Matt Abdou, offered to help Abadie fight the ticket in court, according to the Times. However, the ticket shows she is also cited for speeding.

‘This law is to prevent people from watching TV in their car. Seriously. You don't need an attorney for this, you can beat this by yourself. I have won several tickets in court. I'll fly down there to help you in court if you like,’ he said in a thread on Google Plus.

Several supporters have encouraged Abadie to argue for Glass’ use on its basis as a navigation device.

Yet others have rejected that notion, writing that unlike new navigational systems, Google Glass ‘is not built to disable itself to block user interaction when moving’. 

Abadie, who is the founder and developer
at 
her company, 33 Labs,
has also given TED talks about the smart glasses.
