Former Canadian Broadcasting Corp radio host Jian Ghomeshi embroiled in a sex scandal now faces additional charges of assaulting three more women.

Ghomeshi, 47, was charged Thursday with the three new counts of sexual assault. He was charged in November with four counts of sexual assault and one of choking stemming from alleged incidents involving three other women.

His lawyer, Marie Henein, said he will plead not guilty to all eight charges.

The three new alleged assaults took place in August 2002, July 2003 and February 2008, Crown prosecutor Michael Callaghan said in court, reported Toronto Star. 

Dressed in a grey suit and black tie, and flanked by his lawyer, Ghomeshi stayed silent as he left the courthouse in Toronto Thursday.

He was greeted by a large crowd of reporters, curious onlookers and protesters, some of whom heckled him. One woman was heard yelling, 'castrate him!' according toThe Globe and Mail. 

The CBC fired Ghomeshi, the host of the internationally syndicated music-and-arts show ‘Q’ heard on public stations in 180 US cities, in October in response to media reports about the allegations.

Ghomeshi has maintained his innocence, saying he had consensual ‘rough sex’ with women, which he compared to ‘a mild form of Fifty Shades of Grey.'

He initially sued his former employer claiming wrongful termination but later withdraw the $55million lawsuit. 

The CBC said it had seen graphic evidence that he had injured a woman in what Ghomeshi said were consensual sex acts involving bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism.

In his seven years at the helm of Q, Ghomeshi interviewed numerous A-list celebrities including Woody Allen, Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney.

The Q show, now being hosted by other people, is carried on Public Radio International and has had a wide following on National Public Radio.

Sacked: The 47-year-old host of the popular culture radio show 'Q' was relieved of duties in October

Since Ghomeshi's November arrest, the CBC has launched an internal investigation into whether senior managers ignored the host's behavior because he boosted the broadcaster's ratings, particularly among a younger demographic.

Ghomeshi, who remains free on $100,000 bail, is due back in court February 4, when a preliminary hearing is expected to begin, but he is not expected to appear in person. 

His bail conditions, which include living with his mother in Toronto's north end until the trial, were renewed.

The CBC is struggling to contain the fallout from the allegations, which recall the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal at the BBC.

The UK broadcaster was accused of turning a blind eye to the sexual assaults because of Savile's celebrity.

The CBC placed two executives on leave of absence Monday. 

The allegations, first reported in the media in October, rocked the Canadian public broadcaster, a vaunted Canadian institution. 

Ghomeshi defended his actions in a 1,500- word statement on Facebook then, saying he had consensual 'rough sex' with women and is the victim of a disgruntled ex-girlfriend.

Canned: CBC fired Ghomeshi in October, saying his firing was prompted by the emergence of 'graphic' evidence that he had caused physical injury to a person

After the Toronto Star reported several more allegations days later, Ghomeshi posted that he would confront the allegations 'directly,' but wouldn't discuss them with the media.  

One of the 12 women who have contacted police since October was actress Lucy DeCoutere, a star of the long-running TV and film series Trailer Park Boys.

DeCoutere, who also serves as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force, was the first woman who made allegations against Ghomeshi to speak on the record about her experience. 

DeCoutere said she went on a date with him and alleges that when they returned to his home, he pressed her up against a wall, choked her and slapped her across the face several times.

Author and lawyer Reva Seth became the second woman to go public, writing in the Huffington Post that Ghomeshi put his hands around her throat and sexually assaulted her, although it was not known if she was one of the women who filed a complaint to police against Ghomeshi.

Seth described in the blog how Ghomeshi was 'funny and charming,' when the pair first started seeing each other casually.

But one evening, she claims, his behaviour suddenly changed.

Speaking out: Actor and Air Force Captain Lucy DeCoutere during a video interview with the Star in regards to her past personal experiences and interactions with CBC host Jian Ghomeshi. Lucy was the first one to speak out publicly about Jian Ghomeshi's hitting and choking

She wrote: 'When it was over, I got up and it was clear I was really angry. My sexual interactions until then had always been consensual, enjoyable and fun.

'He gave me some weird lines about how he couldn't tell if I was actually attracted to him or not. And somehow this was meant to explain his behaviour.'

Afterwards she decided not to involve the police and opted not to come forward fearing the impact of online trolls.

But she eventually decided to reveal her identity after hearing Lucy DeCoutere speaking on CBC about her 'remarkably similar experience'.

None of the allegations from any of the women have been proven.
