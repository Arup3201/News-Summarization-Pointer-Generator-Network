Kelly Brook is said to have dumped boyfriend Danny Cipriani after he allegedly cheated on her.

The model, 33, was horrified when she found messages to other women on the rugby player's mobile phone last weekend, according to The Sun.

The former Big Breakfast presenter's discovery came just days after they returned from holiday in Turkey.

It's over... again: Kelly Brook and Danny Cipriani, pictured in London in June, have reportedly split up for the second time

The Sun claims the Sale Sharks fly-half, 25, was even sending sexy messages to other women while Kelly nursed him back to health after he was hit by a bus in April.

The paper also claimed Danny had slept with other women during their seven month romance.

When Kelly found the messages, she threw
Danny out of her London home and has since deleted all recent photos of
him from her Instagram page.

Sales manager Stacey Simcox, from Birmingham, claims she was bombarded with sexy messages and photos from Danny after meeting him eight months ago.

Stacey told the paper: 'He'd send me filthy messages about what he wanted to do to me and begging to meet up for sex.

'It got progressively more explicit and I just thought, "What a rat."'

Stacey said she refused Danny's 
requests to meet up, even receiving an invitation as recently as July 27
- the day he flew to Bodrum with his famous girlfriend.

A friend told the paper: 'Danny is absolutely devastated. He just can't believe what he's done - he just wants Kelly back.'

While Kelly hasn't directly referenced 
the split on her Twitter, she did post a saying on her Instagram on 
Sunday, reading: 'Some people come into your life as blessings, others 
come into your life as lessons.' 

She wrote a cryptic Tweet on Twitter on Tuesday, which she has since deleted, reading: 'I often wonder if more girls were willing to be ladies, would more guys feel challenged to be gentlemen?'

In an interview in June, Danny denied speculation he was planning to propose to Kelly.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I’m very happy where I am and I feel very fortunate to have Kelly. But I’ve got a bad knee so I definitely won’t be getting down on one knee any time soon.

'I think everyone has got their own 
individual wants. Some want children and marriage, some don’t. I may be 
one or the other. I don’t know.'

Kelly started dating Danny - who she 
previously dated for 22 months until June 2010 - in January this year, 
just weeks after she split from his former London Wasps teammate Thom Evans, 28.

When Kelly and Thom announced their split, she vehemently denied it had anything to do with her spending time with her ex Danny.

Reports at the time claimed Thom was unhappy that Kelly kept in contact with her ex throughout their relationship.

Kelly and Danny share custody of their dog Rocky - which they got together during their original romance.

Meanwhile, retired rugby player Thom has also moved on and is dating former 90210 actress Jessica Lowndes.

In May, Kelly was involved in a war of words on Twitter with nemesis Katie Price - who briefly dated Danny in October 2011 - with the mother-of-three claiming Danny will 'never be faithful'.

Danny's representative declined to comment when contacted by the MailOnline. Kelly's spokesperson is yet to comment.

Despite a eight year age gap and a split three years ago, the couple were photographed spending time together earlier this year. When Kelly announced her split from Thom in February, she insisted 'Thom and I mutually agreed to go our separate ways some time ago. It had absolutely nothing to do with a third party.'

Just weeks after Kelly and former rugby player Thom started dating, the model announced she was pregnant with his child. However, tragically she suffered a miscarriage in May 2011 when she was five months pregnant.

Kelly fell for Titanic star Billy on set of Three (aka Survival Island), which coincided with the end of her seven year relationship with Jason Statham. Despite their engagement, the pair briefly split in April 2008, but got back together, before finally calling things off in August that year. During their brief split, Kelly claimed she was 'too young at 28 to get married'.

Kelly started dating action star Jason when she was just 18. During their seven year romance, Kelly lived with the actor in Los Angeles. She left him for Billy after falling in love, but insisted she was very honest with the English actor. She said in a 2004 interview: 'I respected him throughout the whole thing and I was totally honest with him. He doesn't hate me or think I humiliated him. What would have been ideal was if I'd been single for a while and then met Billy, but it just doesn't happen that neatly.'
