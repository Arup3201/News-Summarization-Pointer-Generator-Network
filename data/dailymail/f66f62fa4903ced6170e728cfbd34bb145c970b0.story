Prof Nicholas Roe claims the poet continued to use the drug after he took it to relieve a chronic sore throat

John Keats was an opium addict while he wrote some of his most famous poems, a contentious new biography claims.

Dismissing other experts who believe that the English Romantic poet experimented with the drug only briefly, author Prof Nicholas Roe claims that after using the drug to relieve a chronic sore throat, he continued dosing himself to ‘keep up his spirits’.

Prof Roe admits his findings in the biography John Keats – A New Life, to be published in October will be contentious.

‘This has never been said before: Keats as an opium addict is new,’ he told The Guardian.

The professor of English literature at the University of St Andrews in Scotland said: ‘My biography takes the contrary view that the spring of 1819 was not only one of Keats' most productive periods but also his most heavily opiated. 

‘He continued dosing himself to relieve his chronically sore throat; and that opium-induced mental instability helps to explain his jealous and vindictive mood swings regarding (his financee) Fanny Brawne.

Keats’ famous poems Ode on Indolence and Ode to a Nightingale were inspired while the poet was under the influence of opium, Prof Roe said.

He said: This explodes entrenched conceptions of him as a delicate, overly sensitive, tragic figure. 

‘That Keats was using opium to enhance what it meant to “fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget” the world gives us a different Keats: a Keats whose struggle with life was more complex, and darker than we have previously thought.’

‘Keats's odes of spring 1819 have often been read as his most “philosophical” engagement with the intractable contraries of beauty and mortality, time and eternity. 

‘To find those two odes and, I suspect, La Belle Dame sans Merci, arose from opium reveries gives us a less intellectual or “philosophical” Keats, and a poet who is closer to the mystical aspects of Romantic tradition associated with Blake, Baudelaire, Coleridge, De Quincey, Yeats, Huxley and Bob Dylan.

‘Like Coleridge's Kubla Khan and like Thomas de Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, Ode to a Nightingale is one of the greatest re-creations of a drug-inspired dream-vision in English literature – a poem that frankly admits his own opium habit.’

According to Prof Roe, the poet - who was also a trained physician - had access to laudanum to administer it to his sick brother Tom in 1818 who was dying of TB.

After Tom died of the disease which he gave to Keats, who would eventually die from it three years later, started using the drug regularly ‘to keep up his spirits’ according to his close friend Charles Brown.

Brown, a writer, is said to have warned Keats of the ‘danger of such a habit’ which Prof Roe believes ‘suggests Keats was indeed an “habitual” user of opium and had been dosing himself for a considerable time’.

Keats first showed symptoms of TB in 1820, after losing Tom as well as his mother to the illness.

Poem Ode on Indolence was inspired by ‘a reverie induced by taking laudanum to ease the pain of a black eye, got while playing cricket on Hampstead Heath in March 1819’.

Prof Roe said: ‘Apparent from his up and down moods, and the increasing turmoil of his relationship with Fanny Brawne in 1820, a phase of his life that resembles Coleridge's opiated anguish over his unrequited passion for Wordsworth's sister-in-law, Sara Hutchinson, in the years 1802 to 1804.’

‘The final, tragic twist of this story (comes) when Keats and the young painter Joseph Severn were voyaging to Naples, en route, they hoped, to find a cure for Keats's TB.

Keats was ordered by his doctors to flee the English winter and move to Italy so he went to Naples and Rome accompanied by friend, Severn.

Prof Roe claims that Severn stopped Keats taking laudanum by hiding the bottle in 1820.

Prof Roe said: ‘As a result, Keats endured the protracted suffering of pulmonary consumption and faced his death without the panacea that had helped his brother and called into being some of the greatest poetry in the language.’

Although the move improved his health at first, he collapsed and died on February 23, 1821.

TB is a bacterial infection which 
commonly attacks the lungs and can be passed to others through kissing, 
sneezing, spitting or breathing.

While it is now curable, it was responsible for one in four deaths in England in 1815.

Andrew Motion, who won the Whitbread prize for biography and wrote a biography of the poet said of Prof Roe’s book: ‘It's not beyond the bounds of possibility that he explored (the effect of the drug in his poems) from these remembered experiences rather than from a full-on vantage point.

‘Nick is making assumptions, just as I made assumptions - that's all we can do, because there is no hard evidence either way.’

The Romantic poet fell in love with the teenage Miss Brawne when she moved in next door to his home in Hampstead, north London but their relationship was never consummated because of his highly contagious illness.
