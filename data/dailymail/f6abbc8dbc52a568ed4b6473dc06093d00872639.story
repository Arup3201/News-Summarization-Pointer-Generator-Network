Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has described Iran and Cuba as threats to the national security of the United States as the leaders of the two nations met in the island's capital of Havana today.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrived in the country for a brief meeting with Raul Castro during his Latin American tour which has already taken in Venezuela and Nicaragua.

But in a statement issued earlier this week Ros-Lehtinen described the meeting as a 'tour of the tyrants' and said it was opportunity to 'spew anti-American rhetoric'.

Speech: Ahmadinejad told students at Havana's university that he wanted to know why Iran was being 'punished' no good reason

The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee added that the Iranian President's fifth visit to the region since 2007 gives an opportunity to unite Latin American leaders against the U.S..

And in a statement released today, the Republican representative from Florida said: 'Iran and Cuba are both state-sponsors of terrorism, and need to be 
treated as immediate threats to our national security.'

She added: 'Just as the Iranian regime has rejected every overture by 
the Administration, the Castro regime will never be coddled into 
changing its ways.'

Ahmadinejad was untroubled by the Congresswoman's comments as he landed at the island's Jose Marti International Airport today, flashing a victory sign several times at photographers as he was greeted by Cuba's Vice president Esteban Lazo.

Later, the Iranian President gave a speech at Havana University where he demanded answers as to why Iran was being 'punished' no good reason.

He told students: 'Have we assaulted someone? Have we 
wanted more than we should have? Never, never. We have only asked to 
speak about and establish justice.'   

He also railed against the United States and its allies and said heartless capitalism is the root cause of war during the speech.

'Thankfully we are already witnessing
that the capitalist system is in decay,' Ahmadinejad, who received an 
honourary doctorate from the university, said.

'On various stages it has come to a dead end - politically, economically and culturally.'

Greeting: Ahmadinejad shakes hands with Cuba's Vice president Esteban Lazo, who stands next to rector of University of Havana Gustavo Cobreiro Suarez

'You see that when it lacks logic, they turn to weapons to kill and destroy.' he added.

After the speech he refused to comment on a bomb attack this morning that killed a nuclear scientist in Tehran, although his government laid the blame on both Israel he U.S. and the UK.

But the Iranian leader spoke warmly of his 
Cuban hosts, describing the relationship of the two countries as 
'solidarity between two revolutionary peoples.'

Ahmadinejad began his Latin America tour shortly after Washington imposed tougher sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program.

Cuba was his third stop on his tour. He will visit Ecuador tomorrow.
