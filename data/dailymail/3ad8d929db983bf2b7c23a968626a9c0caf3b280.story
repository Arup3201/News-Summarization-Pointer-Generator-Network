A German man has won the annual race up the Empire State Building's stairs, dashing up the 1,576 steps in just over 10 minutes.

The men's race on Wednesday night was won by German runner Christian Riedel, a first-time winner of the Empire State Building Run-Up, who came in at 10 minutes and 16 seconds

And Australian Suzy Walsham came first in the women's elite field when she climbed to the 86th-floor observatory, winning the event for a sixth time in a record for the women's event.

Participants for the 38th annual tower climb, organized by NYCRUNS, came from around the world and were led by the elite women's and men's groups.

The general field followed, with staggered seconds-apart start times for racers to avoid a crush of people all trying to get into the stairwell at the same time.

Last year, Mrs Walsham won the women's event in 11 minutes and 57 seconds and Thorbjorn Ludvigsen, of Norway, won the men's race in 10 minutes and 6 seconds. 

The Australian's participation in the race to defend her title was well-hyped.

She said: 'It's a long, tough race, it's incredibly rewarding to run up such an iconic building.'

The course records are 9 minutes and 33 seconds for the men, set by Australian Paul Crake in 2003, and 11 minutes and 23 seconds for the women, set by Austrian Andrea Mayr in 2006.

German Thomas Dold holds the record for most men's victories, with seven.

The Empire State Building Run-Up is one of the most well-known tower climbs in the world and money raised through entry frees is used to help people with physical disabilities.
