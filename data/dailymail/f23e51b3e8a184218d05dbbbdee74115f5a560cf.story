Jose Mourinho is master-minding another ‘15 or 20 years’ as one of the world’s top managers.

The Chelsea manager is still only 51-years-old but is already one of the most decorated coaches to grace the game, having won titles in England, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

His latest project, returning to Chelsea for a second spell, is beginning to bear fruit in its second season with the side already storming ahead at the top of the Barclays Premier League, leading their Champions League group, yet to be knocked out of a competition and unbeaten in 14 games.

Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa clicked instantly but Mourinho insists his side isn't as good as that of 2005

Mourinho said: ‘For me the situation is clear: I want to work, 15 or 20 more years. If, during this time, I do well enough to stay in a top level club, I will. 

'If I don’t do well enough, and my market changes and I only have smaller clubs waiting for me, I will. Because I repeat, I want to work if I’m physically and mentally strong enough – which I expect to be – for another 15 to 20 years.’

The Portuguese claims that this team he has put together is still not comparable to the Chelsea side who he first won the title with back in 2005.

According to Mourinho, his current team take more work than the side from a decade ago because the players are not yet finished products.

‘Back then it was a new team with almost all of them final products, top players,’ he added. ‘This team is giving me more work, if we can use that word, to bring them to that level. Because, end products are one thing and players with great talents are another thing.’

The next step in that process is facing Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. Chelsea will be boosted by the return of top-scorer Diego Costa to the side. The striker has not played since he aggravated his problematic hamstrings away on international duty with Spain.

He has missed the past four games and Didier Drogba has flourished in his absence, scoring three goals in the last three matches.
