BBC business editor Robert Peston has revealed he still seeks advice from his late wife.

The 53-year-old broadcaster - whose wife Siân Busby died from lung cancer aged 51 last year - said their relationship has not ‘vanished’, and their ‘conversation’ has continued after her death.

Mr Peston, who was speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, admitted that he still seeks the advice of his wife - an author he had known since his school days - in ‘challenging situations’.

He was interviewed by his BBC colleague Huw Edwards at the Gloucestershire event about her last novel, A Commonplace Killing, which she authored quietly before she died last September.

Mr Peston, who transcribed the book after her death, said: ‘If you’re lucky enough, as I was, to have a partnership as rich and important as my one with Siân, you continue in a sense to have a dialogue.

‘Even after physically she’s gone. This was the most, I suppose, obvious way in which the conversation was kept going.

According to the Daily Telegraph, he added: ‘As the person who was mostly the counsellor in my life, I still find myself asking her in a sense what the right thing to do in a challenging situation [is].’

In an introduction to her book, Mr Peston said that he wrote up her final chapters out of ‘selfishness’, adding that he wanted to ‘keep talking to her’.

Reviewed by Geoffrey Wansell for the Mail in May, the crime novel was described as ‘deeply heartfelt’ and one that ‘brings a tear to the eye, for it shows what a fine novelist we have lost’

Set in North London in 1946, the book opens when two small boys discover a woman’s body on a bomb site. It is believed at first that she was raped - but when it is later discovered she was not sexually assaulted, police turn their attention to her private life.

The book was also labelled by the Mail’s reviewer as ‘elegant, spell-binding and unbearably sad’. Miss Busby, who was not a smoker, was survived by her husband and two sons.
