Travellers heading to this year's Ryder Cup, World Cup and Commonwealth Games are being urged to be on their guard for travel scams as figures show they cost holidaymakers £7million in 2013.

Fake airline tickets, bogus accommodation and scam package holidays left a huge dent in the wallets of UK travellers last year - with more than 4,500 holiday booking frauds reports to police.

The warning comes in the form of a joint initiative, launched today by ABTA, The City of London Police’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, and Get Safe Online, alerting holidaymakers to potential dangers.

Travel scams: Holidaymakers are being urged to research a company's credentials before booking

Its figures reveal nearly 30 per cent of holiday fraud victims in 2013 were scammed by fake adverts for villas and apartments, with some holidaymakers arriving at their destination to find the property didn't exist.

The second most common type of booking fraud is airline tickets (21 per cent), where a traveller pays for a fare and receives a fake ticket, or doesn't receive one at all. The average loss is more than £1,000 per person, with flights to West Africa a particular target.

While 17 percent of holiday fraud cases 
reported last year were package holiday scams, particularly group, 
sports and religious packages. 

The report highlights the Hajj 
pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia and major sporting events such as the Ryder 
Cup as particular targets for fraudsters.

Victims: Laura and Sean Parks, pictured on their wedding day, were left £1,000 out of pocket

And those heading to this year's World Cup in Brazil, or the Ryder Cup and Commonwealth Games in Scotland are being urged to be on their guard when booking their trips.

The report also highlights one couple - Laura and Sean Parks from Thirsk, North Yorkshire, who were left £1,000 out of pocket after booking a Loch Ness Valentine's weekend away, which turned out to be a scam.

The couple were 
stranded in a blizzard after paying for the break through a professional-looking website, which was advertised on Facebook.

However, the scammers had stolen the photos of the accommodation from a legitimate site, and Mr and Mrs Parks arrived in Loch Ness to find they had no accommodation booked. 

Laura, 21, who had booked the holiday for Sean, 33, a soldier on leave from Afghanistan, said: 'We were left feeling disappointed and angry after discovering the lodges did not exist. We had driven for more than seven hours, so were extremely tired and did not expect something like this to happen.

'It was an upsetting experience and one we hope we will never have again.'

Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer 
said: 'Group packages can be a particular target for fraudsters because they often involve very large sums of money and have a long lead time between booking and taking the trip.

'With the World Cup, Commonwealth Games and Ryder cup coming up, consumers should be wary of these types of scams. 

'We would advise consumers to make sure they book with a reputable company and at the very least, thoroughly research the company to make sure they, and the deals they are promoting, are legitimate.'

Scam warning: Sports fans heading to events such as the Ryder Cup are being urged to check their paperwork

NFIB director Detective Superintendent Peter O'Doherty said the internet has changed the way we look for and book our holidays. He added: 'Unfortunately it is also enabling fraudsters to prey upon those looking for that perfect break.

'We
 would urge those who have fallen foul of fraudsters to come forward by 
contacting Action Fraud to report their loss. By reporting it, victims 
are helping the NFIB to identify and effectively target those most 
responsible for this damaging and distressing crime.'

Get Safe Online chief executive Tony Neate said it was vital for holidaymakers to do their research before booking.

ABTA, the NFIB and Get Safe Online have published advice on how to avoid becoming a victim of holiday booking fraud – and on how victims should go about reporting it, including the top tips below:

Do your research: Don’t just rely on one review, do a thorough online search to ensure the company’s credentials.

@highlight

Look for the logo: Check whether the company is a member of a recognised trade body such as ABTA. You can verify membership of ABTA online, at www.abta.com

@highlight

Stay safe online: Check the web address is legitimate and has not been altered by slight changes to a domain name – such as going from .co.uk to .org

@highlight

Pay safe: Never pay directly into an owner's bank account. Paying by direct bank transfer is like paying by cash – the money cannot be traced and is not refundable. Where possible, pay by credit card, (or a debit card that offers protection).

@highlight

Check paperwork: You should study receipts, invoices and terms and conditions, and beware of any companies that don’t provide any at all.

@highlight

Use your instincts: If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
