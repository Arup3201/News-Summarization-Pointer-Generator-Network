A multimillionaire property tycoon shot in his Rolls Royce by a cyclist may have been saved by the car's thick windows. 

British-born philanthropist Kameron Segal, 48, was hit in the face and chest in a parking lot on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, on Friday night just before leaving work to discuss a $5million business deal. 

The CEO of Williams Holdings property and acquisitions was sitting behind the wheel of his $300,000 Rolls Royce Wraith at the time and may have escaped death because the bullets hit the denser glass - which are installed to mute exterior sounds. 

The LAPD are still searching for the man who fled the scene on his bike after firing into the car.

His family, including his four-year-old son, are believed to have travelled from the UK to be at his bedside in LA. 

Mr Segal's friends believe that he may have been the victim of a 'high-priced' hit as nothing was stolen from the car. 

Closing a deal: Kameron Segal, 48, was about to close a $5 million deal when he was shot on Friday. The thick glass on his $300,000 car may have saved his life 

Scene: Segal was shot in the face and chest in a parking lot on Sunset Boulevard before leaving to meet his business partner on Friday night

Motive: Mr Segal's friends believe he may have been the victim of a 'high-price' hit as nothing was stolen from the car. A manhunt for the suspect is still underway 

Josh Karp, a salesman at Meltdown Comics, which is just a couple of doors down from the parking lot, said he saw a 'stark naked' man get out of the car covered in bandages.

He told the LA Times: 'They quickly took him away. It was surreal.'

His friend, Steve Castro told ABC News: 'It seems like there’s something behind it and, hopefully, we can get to the bottom of it.'

Possible leads in the case include the unusual circumstances surrounding the lucrative deal he was believed to be on his way to completing.

Another friend, Mytchell Mora, said: 'In particular on a Friday night, making that type of investment at 10, 11pm at night; that to me just didn’t sound like Kameron.' 

Mr Segal was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in critical condition. He is expected to make a full recovery.

According to KTLA, witnesses saw the suspect fleeing on a bike after the shots were fired.

Installation: The windows on the $300,000 Rolls Royce Wraith are thicker so drivers and passengers inside the luxury vehicle are not subjected to noises from outside (file picture)

The LAPD have now launched a manhunt for the shooter who was last seen wearing a baseball cap and carrying a ruck sack as he fled the scene 

Authorities believe he is a black man in his late 30s to early 40s, is said to be around six feet tall and was last seen wearing a baseball cap and carrying a ruck sack. 

Aerial footage of the scene showed fire engines and patrol cars surrounding the vehicle which has suicide doors - where the hinges are at the rear rather than the front.

Mr Segal is the CEO of Williams Holdings property and acquisitions, one of the largest apartment complex owners in LA.

He was interviewed by News 11 in 2013 after he installed solar panels on buildings throughout the city.

In December 2013 he surprised a homeless woman who had lost her job by giving her an apartment for Christmas. 

A man matching the description of the suspect was taken into custody nearby but was later released.
