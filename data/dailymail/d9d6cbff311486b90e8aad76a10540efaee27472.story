Oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens and his fourth wife Madeleine are filing for divorce after seven years of marriage.

The separation is amicable although the couple are 'saddened' by the split, according to Pickens' spokesman.

Boone Pickens, an Oklahoma native, has made $1.2billion from oil drilling and corporate takeovers. The 84-year-old tycoon and philanthropist has become a vocal advocate for alternative energy in recent years.

Pickens is a prolific donator to the Republican Party. He has also given his alma-mater of Oklahoma State University $165million to athletics and $100million for academics.

Pickens is number 360 on the Forbes 400 richest people in the U.S. with an estimated wealth of $1.2billion. 

Madeleine Pickens, 65, is an animal rights advocate who campaigns to protect horses through her charity Saving America's Mustangs in Nevada.

The foundation is supported by her husband along with other high-profile board members including supermodel Erin Wasson and media billionaire Ted Turner. 

The Pickens married in 2005 after the death of Madeleine's multimillionaire second husband, Gulfstream Aerospace founder Allen E. Paulson in 2000. It is believed she was married once before and has one daughter, Dominique Richter.

In 2003, she was involved in an ugly custody battle over Paulson's $100million estate. Madeleine, his third wife, took Paulson's youngest son Michael to court claiming he had not honored his late father's estate.

She blamed him for allowing her health insurance to lapse and having her country club membership revoked, according to Forbes.

Michael Paulson alleged that Madeleine hid art and furniture in a warehouse and put a deposit on a Rolls-Royce which his father was dying from cancer. The court battle was finally settled in March 2004.

Madeleine and Boone tied the knot at her home in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Mr Pickens was three times divorced from Nelda Cain, Beatrice Carr and Lynn O'Brien. The tycoon has five children and 12 grandchildren.

Spokesman Jay Rosser said that while both Mr and Mrs Pickens are sad, 'they understand' that Madeleine has family interests and animal welfare projects in California and Nevada, while Boone primarily runs his empire from Texas.

The Pickens lived in an opulent mansion in the exclusive suburb of Preston Hollow, Dallas where neighbors include former president George W. Bush, many of the Dallas Cowboys and George Michael. Homes range in value from $800,000 to $40million.

Pickens also owns the Mesa Vista, a property worth around $35million set in 68,000 acres in Roberts County, Texas.

The billionaire has his own gulfstream jet which he parks at his private airport in Pampa, Texas and fuels up to take him to Oklahoma State football games. 

Pickens started his career at Phillips Petroleum before founding Mesa Petroleum in 1956. 

In recent years he has been a driving force in alternative energy, pushing his Pickens Plan - which promotes the uptake of wind and solar power along with natural gas across the U.S.

He had planned to build the world's largest wind farm in Texas but put plans on hold during the economic turn-down.
