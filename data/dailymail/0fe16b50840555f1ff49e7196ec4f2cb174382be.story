Doctors surgeries will be upgraded using a new £1 billion fund paid for by bank fines, George Osborne announced today.

The Chancellor said the cash would pay for a 'permanent improvement in GP services' and comes on top of an extra £2 billion injection into the NHS budget set to be formally announced on Wednesday.

The funding will allow patients  to undergo chemotherapy and dialysis closer to home.

Chancellor George Osborne will announce an extra £3billion is to be spent on healthcare in Wednesday's Autumn statement

The announcement, ahead of Wednesday's Autumn Statement by the Chancellor, is designed to blunt Labour’s electoral advantage on the NHS.

But Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls this morning promised to spend an extra £2.5billion on top of the Government's £3 billion cash injection.

Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show this morning Mr Osborne insisted that increasing funding for the NHS was only possible because the economy was growing.

He said: ‘Because we have a strong economy and we've got the public finances under control, we can afford to put £2 billion into the front-line of the NHS, across the UK.’

He added: ‘Indeed I can tell you we can go further and use those fines that have been paid by the banks for a permanent improvement in GP services. 

'This is a down payment on the NHS's own long-term plan.’

The new money for GPs from bank fines amounts to £250 million a year for four years.

The other £2 billion comes from £1.3 billion in new cash from the Treasury – with £700 million from Health Department ‘reallocated’ to the frontline NHS.

Mr Balls said a Conservative plan for £3 billion injection into the NHS was “crisis money”.

He said: ‘The Conservatives wasted £3bn on their reorganisation of the NHS. So, this is a typical Tory pattern - a winter crisis and then crisis money coming after it.

‘The question is: is this a one off? Or is this going to be actual long-term investment in the nurses and doctors we need.

‘Labour has said we will have a tax on high value properties, £2.5bn over and above Tory spending plans for 20,000 more nurses, doctors, care workers too. We will save the NHS. As you can see the Tories are really putting the NHS in danger.’

No 10 is acutely conscious that despite Ed Miliband’s rock-bottom personal ratings, the NHS remains the only policy area in which Labour consistently polls ahead of the Conservatives.

The expected announcement in Wednesday’s speech comes after days of behind-the-scenes jostling between the Tories and Liberal Democrats to claim credit for the NHS funding boost, with Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb publicly calling for more resources to prevent a ‘crash’ in services over the winter.

It had previously been rumoured that the NHS boost would amount to only £1 billion.

The Autumn Statement is also expected to contain a number of big budget infrastructure announcements, with priority given to major new roads.

Ministers are under orders from No 10 to be photographed next to the projects for use in ‘puff’ pieces for local papers.

Mr Osborne will claim in the statement – his last major pre-Election Commons setpiece other than March’s Budget – that his handling of the economy has enabled him to free up extra resources for the health service.

‘You can’t have a strong NHS without a strong economy to pay for it. If you don’t have a long-term plan for the economy, you don’t have a plan for the future of the NHS,’ he is expected to say, adding: ‘We have both. It’s because our economy is growing, and we’ve kept a tight control on the finances, that we can do more for the NHS.’

The Chancellor is also planning to make the political point that extra NHS funding should be allied to the more efficient management which he claims would be ensured by a Conservative administration.

‘This will support the day- to-day work of our incredible nurses, doctors and other NHS staff; but it is also a down- payment on the future of our health service.

‘This new money will be used to buy the new facilities and services that will help transform the NHS so it becomes more efficient for taxpayers and effective for patients.’

Mr Osborne will also claim credit for the fact that ‘the British economy is growing faster than any other major economy in the world’ – but will also repeat David Cameron’s warning earlier this month about the risks of a new global downturn hitting the UK economy.

Labour fought back last night, with Chris Leslie, the party’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, saying: ‘This week George Osborne will have to admit that he has broken his promises.

‘He has failed to deliver rising living standards and that failure is why he’s also set to break his promise to balance the books by next year.

‘We need a plan to save and transform our health service too. Labour will raise an additional £2.5 billion a year, on top of Tory spending plans, for an extra 20,000 nurses and 8,000 GPs.’
