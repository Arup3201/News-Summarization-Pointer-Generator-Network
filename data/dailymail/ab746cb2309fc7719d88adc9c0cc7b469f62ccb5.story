A mother who accidentally locked her toddler in her car was told by the AA they couldn't help unless she took out a £150 membership on the spot.

Nicola Millar, 36, was left stranded because her purse was inside the Ford Focus C-Max so she was unable to pay the money up front.

She flagged down a van driver who is a member of the AA - who describe themselves as 'the fourth emergency service' - but they told him they couldn't help.

Stranded: Nicola Millar, whose daughter Violet was trapped inside the car, was told by the AA they couldn't help unless she paid £150 for a membership

Mrs Millar, whose 17-month-old toddler daughter Violet was inside the car, burst into tears in Chingford, north-east London.

She said: 'I was told I needed to make the payment first over the phone. I told them I couldn’t as my purse and was in the car.

'They then asked me to ring someone I knew to make the payment, again I told them I couldn’t because I didn’t know any numbers off by heart and my phone was locked in the car.

Refusal: AA - who describe themselves as the fourth emergency service - said if it was an actual emergency people should call the fire brigade

'At this point, they said they couldn’t help me. I was disgusted by their response, it’s not as if I was going to knock them, I was desperate.'

After 45 minutes van driver James King decided to smash the back passenger seat window to retrieve the keys.

He also smashed a very small front window as well in an attempt to get into the car.

AA insisted today that they would normally help someone who was not one of their members and charge them a membership fee later.

However, they said a new member of staff took the call from Mrs Millar who did not know the correct way to handle the situation.

By way of apology, they have offered to give her a one-year membership for free.

Mother-of-one Mrs Millar had been shopping at Morrisons when she shut the boot as she tried to fold up a pram without realising she had accidentally locked her car.

Mr King, 57, phoned the AA for help as he has full membership - but they said they couldn't help unless Mrs Millar signed up herself.

Mr King says he has been let down by the AA.

'It is absolutely disgusting,' he said. 'If anything, they should have come out and done something using my membership but they totally refused.

Anger: After a 45 minute impasse, a van driver smashed the rear window of Mrs Millar's car for her

'This poor woman was really upset and it was out-of-order for them to leave her in tears whilst her 17-month-old girl is crying in the back seat.'

A spokesman for the AA apologised for the ‘unfortunate’ incident.

'We would like to apologise to Nicola Millar for the distress caused,' he said.

'We would normally send a patrol and sort the paperwork afterwards. Unfortunately, the call handler she spoke to was new to the team and didn’t flag it up to a manager, as should have happened.

'Every year we rescue thousands of children and animals locked in cars and our patrols regularly go way beyond the call of duty.'
