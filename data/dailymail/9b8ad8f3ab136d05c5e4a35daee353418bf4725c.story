Sergeant Major Harry Gurung killed a married couple when he had a sneezing fit as he was overtaking them on his way to his army barracks, a court has heard

A former Gurkha was cleared of killing a married couple in a car crash when he suffered a sneezing fit at the wheel.

Leading Gurkha Sergeant Major Harry Gurung, 45, sneezed four to five times as he overtook a car at 74mph on his way back to his barracks.

He was accused of killing pensioners David and Mary Marshall when he clipped the rear of their Ford Ka - but a top expert on the common cold supported his claim that sneezes could be to blame.

Professor Ronald Eccles, director of Britain’s Common Cold Centre, said it was 'impossible' for people to sneeze with their eyes open.

And a jury found Gurung not guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and by careless driving.

Professor Eccles, 66, who has been studying the common cold for more than 40 years, told the jury: 'A typical sneeze lasts for up to three seconds and both eyes always close during a sneeze.

'If Mr Gurung sneezed four times he would have been distracted by it for up to 12 seconds.

'His eyes would have been closed for up to four seconds.”

Professor Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University, said years of research had gone into sneezing.

He told the court: 'Researchers found that prolonged sneezing is accompanied by a loss of vision and an involuntary closure of the eyes which may be hazardous when driving.

'A sneeze during a critical moment of a journey could have serious consequences.'

Professor Eccles said a sneeze could be triggered by a jet of air coming from a car’s air conditioning system.

Career soldier Gurung was driving back to his barracks in Brecon, Powys, after an all-day Army event when he suffered the sneezing fit.

Gurung told police: 'I put my right indicator on and as I overtook I began sneezing in rapid succession.

'I was trying to keep my eyes on the road - I was trying all I could to control my vehicle.

'That was the last memory I have, it all happened so quickly.'

Retired RAF Flight Sergeant Mr Marshall, 79, was killed outright in the crash. His wife, Mary, 73, died four days later.

The pair were driving back from a church barbecue when the accident happened on the A40 near Abergavenny, South Wales,

Newport Crown Court (pictured) heard analysis of the onboard computer of Gurung's VW Golf showed he was travelling at a speed of between 69-78mph - with an average of 74mph

Newport Crown Court heard Gurung, of Brecon, is one of the most decorated Gurkhas ever to have served with the British Army.

He saw action in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan where he won bravery wards and was decorated by the US Government.

His commanding officer Major Stuart Lawrence told the court: 'As an individual he is honourable, loyal and completely at the top of his game. I have complete trust in him.'

Gurung, who is no longer in the Army and has a civilian job for the Ministry of Defence, is chairman of the Wales Nepalese Society.

He denied two charges of causing death by dangerous driving and two alternative charges of causing death by careless driving.

He was found not guilty by the jury at Newport Crown Court

Judge Daniel Williams said: 'There are no more difficult cases than this type.

'I extend my condolences to the friends and family of Mr and Mrs Marshall.'

The court heard analysis of the onboard computer of Gurung’s VW Golf showed he was travelling at a speed of between 69-78mph - with an average of 74mph.

The Gurkha had driven to an Army event in Swindon at 6.15am and was on his way back to his base in Brecon, Powys, when he claims he was hit by the sneezing fit at 9.25pm.
