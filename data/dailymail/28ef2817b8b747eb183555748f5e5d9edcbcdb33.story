A fourth member of a gang branded the 'ASBO Angels' has been named and shamed after exploiting frail old men for cash - by stealing kisses from them.

The four women would target the elderly by posing as carers or offering to help with their weekly shopping before asking for and taking their money.

CCTV captured one of the women flirting and planting a kiss on the cheek one of the victims after bluffing her way into his home.

At least 40 victims aged in their 70s and 80s handed over cash to Andrena Kelly, 36, Emma Reeves, 36,Tracy Halliday 40, and Lesley Bennett, 36, after the women carried out activities on their neighbourhoods looking for likely targets.

Police fear there are many other elderly men targeted by the women in Chorley, Lancashire, but are too embarassed to come forward.

Today Kelly joined accomplices Reeves, Halliday and Bennett by being issued with an anti social behaviour order, which has banned them from all sheltered housing and supported living accommodation in their hometown.

The orders say they cannot offer to provide any services for gain - except for legitimate employment or business.

They also cannot carry ID or bank cards belonging to another person.

After the hearing at Chorley Magistrates' Court, Inspector Dave Robinson of Lancashire Police said: 'This activity has been going on for some years and the victims we know about are potentially only the tip of the iceberg. 

'There are likely to be many other vulnerable victims we are not aware of who have not reported issues due to embarrassment or a lack of capacity to do so.

'A lot of this activity has taken place behind closed doors and so has been very difficult to get a handle on.

'This is a great result for us and indeed the community of Chorley as a whole. 

'Most of the victims have suffered some financial loss, as well as being made to feel threatened and intimidated in their own homes.

The victims’ vulnerabilities and associated problems have in the past presented considerable difficulties in mounting substantive criminal prosecutions.

'These ASBOs will give us the ability to closely monitor these individuals’ activities and hopefully prevent many more vulnerable people becoming victims. It will also give us the means to get these individuals quickly before a court for any breaches.'

Local Labour Councillor Adrian Lowe said: 'I’m delighted that these women have been given ASBOs.

'They preyed on men who were particularly vulnerable.

'A lot of hard work has been done by our officers working in partnership with the police and other agencies to gather the evidence to achieve this result.

'I would hope that this will give people who feel they’re being exploited the confidence to tell us and not feel embarrassed. If you are a victim of this type of crime, or any type of anti-social behaviour, then please tell someone, it’s the only way we can put a stop to it.'

Police said officers gathered a dossier of evidence showing the three women stealing from and offering services to vulnerable members of the community over the past year.

It included taking inappropriate sums of money to assist with domestic chores such as shopping.

They also offered sexual services for financial rewards.

Reeves had previously served three years jail after talked her way into the home of a couple aged 79 and 83 before stealing £740.

She was captured on CCTV taking money from one of her victims after giving him a kiss.

David Dickinson, 55, whose father Jack, 80, was targeted by the women in another incident said: 'My dad has has Alzheimer’s and now he keeps repeating: "Have I told you I’ve been robbed?” He has been left upset and confused.

'He keeps saying "I thought I was safe here".'

Mr Dickinson added: 'I am so angry with these women. They’re just horrible people. Your natural human instinct is to look after vulnerable old people yet these women pretended to care when they didn’t.

'In my dad’s case the woman said she was his carer but when he let her in, he realised straight away that she wasn’t his carer because they have a set routine and this woman wasn’t behaving in a way that the carers usually do.

'She started looking around and asked him if he had any money. God knows what she took. But apparently she was in and out straight away. Even if it was only a couple of quid, the effect it has had is awful.

'Then another time they came to the window and asked for a cigarette so he gave them one and she said 'have you not got anymore? I know you’ve got more.'

'They imposed themselves on him. They were making excuses trying to get into the building. It’s disgusting. They’re preying on the vulnerable. I’m not sure what good an ASBO will do? Some take pride in it, don’t they. They should be in jail.'

The orders will remain in place until December 2015.
