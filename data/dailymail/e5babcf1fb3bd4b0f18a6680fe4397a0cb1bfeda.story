Oscar Pistorius admitted he was ‘haunted’ by his ‘dark side’ in a devastating email which was never shown during his murder trial, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

In an emotional six-page message the Paralympian confesses to causing ‘pain and humiliation’ by bombarding an ex-girlfriend with 30 emails and phone calls a day, cheating on her, then keeping ‘secrets and lies’ from her.

But the letter was not revealed to the judge despite offering an insight into the emotional instability of the 27-year-old. 

Oscar Pistorius pictured with former girlfriend Sammy Taylor - her mother has now written a book that includes the email where the athlete admits being 'haunted' by his 'dark side' 

Writing to his ex-girlfriend Sammy Taylor during their break-up a few months before he met Reeva Steenkamp, Pistorius says: ‘Everyone has their darkness.’

‘The problem with personal truth is that as clean as the slate you want to portray may be, there are often very dark areas that haunt you.

‘For most of my adult life I have had moments when I sabotage the good that I have and find myself back in the comfort of the instability that I had become accustomed to.’

Ex girlfriend Sammy Taylor yesterday told of how she feared the ‘angry and possessive’ Pistorius would kill her and revealed she once hid his gun after he flew into a rage

The 2012 email was subpoenaed by State prosecutors but never offered as evidence. Now experts say prosecutor Gerrie Nel should produce it when the case re-opens on October 13 for sentencing.

The email is printed in full in the new book, An Accident Waiting To Happen, written by Sammy’s mother Trish. 

In the message, he says: ‘I’m not used to having to think and consider others’ feelings,’ and he confesses to an affair with Russian model Anastassia Khozissova.

‘I should never have done that,’ he wrote, ‘and I know it would have broken me if the roles were reversed. I don’t want to have any secrets or lies with you, even if it’s too late.’

Sammy yesterday told of how she feared the ‘angry and possessive’ Pistorius would kill her and revealed she once hid his gun after he flew into a rage.
