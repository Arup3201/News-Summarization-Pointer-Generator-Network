An ingenious blog featuring mocked-up images of a Philippine puppy with the Royal Family has raised £1,300 to find the neglected dog a safe home in the UK.

Mango the puppy was rescued by Martin Usborne from the street where dogs are sold for slaughter on the illegal meat market.

With slogans including 'Give this puppy a Royal new life' and 'Mango wants fish and chips,' Mr Usborne's comic approach to the sad cause has garnered huge support.

Yes we can: Mango's appeal went as far as the White House in this mocked-up image. The blog aimed to raise £1,000 for Mango's medical treatments and flight to the UK

He said: 'Often animal cruelty is so 
sad that people can't engage with it. I wanted to get people interested 
in Mango's story and the problems with the dog meat market, but to do it
in an entertaining way.'

40-year-old Mr Usborne set himself 
the challenge to save as many animals as he could in a year.

He 
travelled to the Philippines with UK charity Network for Animals, where 
he found Mango.

He created and sold the prints featuring Mango on his blog A Year To Help.

He said: ‘The response online has 
been incredible and I raised enough money to have her flown over in only
a few weeks of putting her on my blog.

'Mango is now safe and getting all 
her vaccinations in Manila. We are now looking for a home for her in 
the UK. She's a gorgeous playful dog.'

Mr Usborne said 3-month-old Mango was found on a street outside capital city Manila, where dogs are sourced for the illegal meat trade.

He rescued the puppy and bought her for $4. He said he hopes Mango's story will help raise awareness about the dog meat trade in the Philippines.

'It is more than likely that Mango would have ended up on a plate once she was big 
enough to be worth slaughtering.

Brit pup: Photographer Martin Usborne kept with the British theme to 
attract people to donate to his cause. He said he has no worries about 
finding a loving home for Mango

Neglected: Mango was found shivering and covered in tics on a street. She had been chained to the wall and was malnourished

Brush with death: Mr Usborne said Mango could easily have been one of 
the dogs that is killed and sold on the illegal meat trade

'A
few days before this photo was taken, I walked into a cafe and was 
offered illegal dog meat, known as 'pulutan.

'The situation is horrendous and leads to thousands of dogs suffering brutal deaths every year. 

'Typically, dogs have their snouts bound 
shut and their front legs forced behind their backs and tied, sometimes 
for days on end before being transported to slaughter

'The travel conditions are so extreme that sometimes 90 out of 100 dogs will die en route.

The dog meat trade is illegal, but is a widespread practice in the Philippines.

it is implicated in the spread of rabies, a disease that kills in the region of 10,000 animals and 300 people in the Philippines every year.

Mr Usborne said: 'I was shocked to find out that many of 
the dogs captured by dog meat traders are family pets.

'I have a dog and 
the thought of him/her being caught, slaughtered and eaten is 
horrifying.'

His Master's Voice: Mango spreads the word about the cruelty of the illegal meat trade

Mr Usborne sold his moving and funny portraits on his blog. He said he was overwhelmed by the support he has received

Tender moment: Mr Usborne is on a year-long mission to save as many animals as he can. He can now add Mango to his toll
