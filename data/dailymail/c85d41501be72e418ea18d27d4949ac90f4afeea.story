Isis is trying to swell its ranks and train fighters using hit video game Grand Theft Auto 5, claiming that what players do in the game resembles their battlefield operations.

They have posted a video to YouTube carrying their flag showing violent scenes from the game, including police officers being gunned down and trucks being blown up.

At the start of the video a message appears that reads: ‘Your games which are producing from you, we do the same actions in the battelfields (sic)!!’

Isis is trying to swell its ranks and train fighters using hit video game Grand Theft Auto 5

This appears to be a way of saying that if you’re playing Grand Theft Auto, you’re already part way to being an Isis fighter.

There are no real-life scenes in the video, which has been made using a mixture of the online multiplayer mode and the solo narrative.

Egyptian media said that the video is meant to ‘raise the morale of the Mujahideen, and the training of children and young teenagers to fight the West, and throw terror into the hearts of opponents of the state’, according toForbes.

It came as a Syrian who was interviewed by Isis to work in its media centre revealed just how slick and well-funded its PR machine is.

Experts believe that the terrorist organisation has amassed the money necessary to run such a formidable operation partly by smuggling oil from oil fields that it’s taken control of.

The Syrian said he had a job interview with Isis to work in its media centre in Raqqa, Syria's capital, and that he was amazed at the salary he was offered and the equipment he would have at his disposal.

The man, who turned the job down, told the Financial Times: 'They offered me $1,500 a month [five times the average Syrian salary], plus a car, a house and all the cameras I needed. I remembered looking around the office. It was amazing the equipment they had in there.'

The U.S is becoming increasingly focussed on finding out precisely where the group's money is coming from.

Barack Obama and other leaders will discuss the issue at next week's annual United Nations General Assembly.

And a new U.S-based research group called the Counter Extremism Project is poised to release to governments and media outlets a database of information about militants and their supporters.

It's convinced that Isis is generating a great deal of wealth – it’s thought to have stockpiled around £1billion - from shady deals with morally compromised companies.

Risk management group Maplecroft believes that Isis controls half a dozen oil fields in Syria and four in Iraq, with many officials convinced it's making millions from smuggling barrels to Turkey, Iran and Iraq.

The group is also known to make money from kidnappings, extortion and robbery.

More airstrikes are expected this week against the group, and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Face The Nation Sunday morning that other countries were willing to join the U.S. in these strikes, though she would not say what countries.

These strikes have already begun in Iraq, and been authorized to begin in Syria by Obama.

In addition, the Senate approved a bill to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels to battle Islamic State militants.

Meanwhile, a description of John Kerry by Isis as an ‘uncircumcised old geezer’ is further evidence of British involvement in the militant organisation, a terrorism expert has said.

The comment about the U.S Secretary of State came in an audio recording by Isis spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani.

He said: 'The uncircumcised old geezer, suddenly became an Islamic jurist, issuing a verdict to the people that the Islamic State was distorting Islam, that what it was doing was against Islamic teachings, and that the Islamic State was an enemy of Islam.'

Professor Anthony Glees, head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of Buckingham, said the use of British slang was hugely significant.

He told MailOnline: ‘I'd say the use of the word "geezer" is a massively important further giveaway about the identity of some of these Isis thugs. It's a term most usually heard in London.

'So Isis have drawn us, I'd suspect intentionally, back towards reflecting on the fact that Brits are fighting for these sadistic butchers, taunting not just the families of the hostages but our government and our position in the world.'

Britain's link to Islamic State became known around the world after shocking videos showed a British man known as 'Jihadi John' executing American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31, as well as British aid worker David Haines, 44.

Some sources believe that Jihadi John comes from a South London suburb about 10 miles from Central London.

Professor Glees added: 'It's my understanding that MI5 and the counter-terrorism police do know the identity of "John" but that like the UK government more generally they don't see any advantage at this stage in telling the rest of us, not so much out of consideration to "John's" family but to the hostages because this is about the lives of innocent hostages here, and every move that we take needs to be very carefully considered before we take it.'
