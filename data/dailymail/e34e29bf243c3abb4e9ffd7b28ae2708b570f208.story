The Ministry of Defence has been blasted for employing more accountants than Army Officers.

The number of beancounters at defence head quarters has risen to 858 - up almost three per cent in two years – at a time when thousands of frontline servicemen are facing the axe and swinging cuts.

New figures, revealed in a response to a parliamentary question, also show the MoD has more accountants than all other Government departments combined.

Facing cuts: The Army is in the midst of huge cutbacks to plug a defence budge black hole of around £42billion

Their army of Associate Chartered 
Accountant qualified number-crunchers dwarfs the 80 working at the 
Treasury department and eclipses the 381 at the Department for Work and 
Pensions, which processes welfare payments.

A further 153 employees were in the middle of their accountancy training.

The embattled MoD, which 
is midst of one of the toughest cost-cutting drives in its history, is 
having to axe 22,000 troops, fleets of warships, ships and armoured 
vehicles to fill a £42billion black hole in its budget.

On the rise: The number of qualified accountants working at the MoD has risen over the past two years to 858 - while servicemen are facing cuts

Yet despite the huge arsenal of accounting expertise, the MoD has still been hit by a series of damaging blunders and accusations of waste and profligacy.

Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of 
the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘People expect their hard-earned cash to 
be spent at the MoD defending the realm and properly equipping our 
troops, not creating jobs for hundreds of beancounters.

‘Over the years the size of the civil service has swelled to a point where it is now seriously bloated.

‘Quite
how this legion of accountants can be justified is a mystery, 
especially when you consider that all the other government departments 
manage with so many fewer.

‘Of course those in uniform need support staff, but this number of accountants is astounding.’

Under the Strategic Defence and 
Security Review (SDSR), unveiled in 2010, the Armed Forces must make 
huge cuts in order to plug a massive shortfall in funding.

Ministers said there was ‘no choice’ but to take ‘difficult decisions’ to tackle a ‘vast black hole’ in the MoD budget.

But
a withering Commons report earlier this year found the cost of Britain’s biggest military
programmes has soared by £500million in a year because ‘wasteful’ 
defence chiefs failed to ‘live within their means’.

Under fire: The Ministry of Defence has been hit by a series of damaging revelations over waste and profligacy which costs taxpayers billions of pounds

The Public Accounts Committee said 15 crucial procurement projects for new equipment, including ‘hunter-killer’ submarines, fighter jets, aircraft carriers and transport planes, are £6.1billion - or 11.4 per cent - over budget.

Defence chiefs wasted £258million during a series of U-turns to make sure the replacement for the scrapped Harrier jump jets could fly from the Royal Navy’s £6.2billion warships.

And last year it was revealed, cash-strapped MoD forked out nearly £600million of taxpayers’ money intended for equipment on hiring consultants, according to an internal audit.

The audit accused the MoD of having budget controls that are ‘poorly developed or non-existent’.

An MoD spokesperson said: ‘There are currently 632 qualified military and civilian accountants in posts across defence out of over a quarter of a million military and civilian staff overall.

'The number of Civil Servants in the MoD has fallen by nearly 15,000 since 2010 and the number of accountants is expected to fall.

‘The MoD has increased financial discipline to get the annual budget of around £35bn back on track. In addition to one of the largest budgets across Whitehall we have one of the biggest balance sheets, including nearly £130bn of assets.

'Accountants help manage hundreds of equipment projects to ensure value for money for the taxpayer and ensure that over 250,000 military personnel and civilian staff receive their pay and pensions.’
