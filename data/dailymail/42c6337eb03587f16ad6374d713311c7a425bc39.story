More than 1,000 convicts who are considered a risk to the public and should be behind bars are unlawfully walking Britain’s streets – including 21 killers and 15 rapists.

The shocking figure emerged in a blizzard of reports from the Ministry of Justice which critics said showed a justice system in ‘crisis’.

Other revelations included the Government failing in its promise to boot out foreign prisoners, a doubling in the number of Muslim inmates over the past decade and sharp rise in the number of criminals absconding from jail.

There was also a record number of violent attacks on prison officers – who are now forced to wear slash-proof vests and body cameras.

The bundle of reports showed how 1,030 criminals who had been recalled to custody for breaching the terms of their release – by, for example, harassing their previous victim - remain unlawfully at large.

Those who managed to go-on-the-run before being found and returned to custody include 17 murderers, four people guilty of manslaughter, 14 rapists, two paedophiles and a further 21 sex attackers.

The total number of offenders at large in this way increased by 23 last year.

There was also an alarming rise in the number going missing from jail – which rose to 225, up almost 30 per cent over the past two years.

This included 137 from open prisons, which have been the subject of controversy after a spate of criminals walked out.

The most high-profile was Michael Wheatley - known as the ‘Skullcracker’ - who sparked a nationwide manhunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.

Union leaders claimed the wrong people were being sent to open jails because of the huge pressure on the system.

In the past year, the total prison population has increased by around 2,000 to a record 85,509.

One reason is that, despite repeated promises by David Cameron to kick-out foreign criminals, the numbers remain stubbornly high.

Figures released yesterday showed there are 10,834 overseas convicts clogging up our jails, up from 10,786 last year.

Other data published by the MoJ showed:

Glyn Travis, of the Prison Officers’ Association, claimed the prisons service is ‘in crisis’.

He said: ‘The prison population is increasing and despite changes introduced by the Ministry of Justice we still believe that inappropriate prisoners are being sent to open conditions as the service tries to manage its available cellular accommodation.

‘The prison service recently crowded more prisons and despite this action, which endangers public safety and prisons, the problem continues to escalate.’

Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ‘Prisons are becoming places of extreme violence as men are caged with nothing to do all day, and in some terrible cases they have become death traps.’

Officials pointed to positive news in the report, with reoffending rates falling slightly.

Some 1,155 prisoners deemed as 'low risk' have worked outside of prison on temporary licences, earning a total of more than £3.6 million - an increase of almost £1 million compared to 2012/13.

The MoJ took around £1million of the money to provide help to victims.

In a statement, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘As with any significant period of change – coupled with prison population increases higher than expected – it has been a challenge. 

'We are responding to and managing the additional pressures but prisons are still running safe and decent regimes.’

He added: ‘Absconds have seen a slight increase this year but are still more than 80 per cent lower than they were a decade ago, and temporary release failures remain below 0.1 oer cent. Escapes are still incredibly rare.

‘The prison population has increased higher than expected. This is due to an increase in remands being held in custody and convicted sex offenders – 680 over the last twelve months.

‘We will always have enough prison places for those sent to us by the courts and we have taken sensible measures to create temporary accommodation until our new houseblocks open later this year.'
