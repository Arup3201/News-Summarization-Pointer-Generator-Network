John Boyett, 24, was arrested for assault, theft and harassment in Greenwood Village, Denver on Wednesday

A drunk former former football player headbutted a cab driver, stole a shovel and tried to hide in mulch before repeatedly telling cops trying to arrest him to call his boss.

John Boyett was arrested in Greenwood Village on Wednesday - and dropped from the Denver Broncos practice squad the following day.

The 24-year-old had been drinking at the Sports Book Bar & Grill, where a bartender and customers said he was very drunk and making threats.

Boyett, who had tried to take food off another person's plate, was soon asked to leave.

He then threatened to punch a bartender and refused to pay his tab. 

Two police officers arrived and called a cab for him - but five minutes later, the driver called to report he had been assaulted by Boyett. 

After he allegedly punched the cab driver, Boyett fled to a nearby construction site, took a shovel, and tried to hide by covering himself in mulch. 

He then told officers arresting him to call his boss, John Elway, the General Manager of the Broncos, before slamming his head repeatedly on the patrol car's window and spitting.  

He has been charged with third-degree assault, theft and harassment. 

The Broncos released him from the team following the arrest - Boyett's second in just over a year. 

The team tweeted yesterday: 'The Denver #Broncos have released safety John Boyett from their practice squad.'

The team told The Denver Post they were 'disappointed' to learn of his arrest and behavior. 

Last season, the Indianapolis Colts released Boyett after he was arrested. 

He was charged with disorderly conduct, public intoxication and resisting law enforcement. 

Boyett had been a sixth-round draft pick from the University of Oregon but he was dropped soon after his arrest.

Boyett had become aggressive with a bouncer and cops on a night out after he was refused entry into an Indianapolis night club because he was too drunk.
