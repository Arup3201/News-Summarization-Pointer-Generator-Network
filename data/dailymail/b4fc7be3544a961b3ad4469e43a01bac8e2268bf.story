A 10-year-old Girl Scout who was riding in an SUV driven by her 13-year-old friend has died after the vehicle crashed and landed on top of her.

The girl, Abigail Clements, was ejected from the rear window when the teenager lost control of the SUV while driving along a gravel road in Bryan County, Oklahoma on Sunday afternoon.

The 2001 Nissan SUV rolled over and she became pinned beneath it, killing her immediately.

The three other children in the car - the driver, another 13-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl - were taken to hospital with injuries. None was wearing a seat belt.

Loss: A 10-year-old girl, Abby, has died after she was thrown from an SUV driven by a 13-year-old friend. The little girl, apparently pictured on relatives' Facebook pages, died at the scene on Sunday

Tragic: The girl was 
thrown through the back window of the SUV and the vehicle then rolled on
top of her, troopers believe. She was inside with three other young 
friends who survived

Troopers said the teenage boy was 
inexperienced and driving at an unsafe speed when the vehicle ran off the
road, over-corrected, rolled over and came to a stop of the passenger's
side.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. Scott Hampton told KTEN that the vehicle rolled one and three-quarter times before stopping.

Several highway patrol vehicles, two fire trucks and two ambulances responded to the tragic scene.

'It's horrible. I can't believe she's gone,' Caitlin Perry, who was friends with the 10-year-old girl and her family, told KTEN. 'He just lost control, and it can be that easily.'

She added of her friend: 'She's just a
good kid. She never got in any trouble, Girl Scouts, cheerleading, her 
mom's real involved. She loved life, she loved living out here in the 
country.'

Scene: The crash, pictured, left the girl dead and 3 others injured. They had not been wearing seat belts

Heartbreaking: Two 13-year-old boys and an 11-year-old girl were taken to hospitals after the accident

Troopers said 
the family lives close to where the crash happened. They said they are 
investigating who owned the vehicle, how the children were riding inside
and the exact cause of the crash.

'As
always when we're at these accidents, we would like for people to 
reduce their speed on roads such as this and always wear their 
seatbelts,' says Hampton.

Another witness, Ronnie Ray Perry, added: 'They
need to pave this road everybody's trying that out here all the time, 
they go way too fast, be reckless, and it's just unreal.'

The
teenage passenger was taken to Dallas Children's Hospital by helicopter
and the 11-year-old girl was taken to MCSO in Durant. Their conditions 
are unknown.
