Cut off by the Nazis, 340,000 Allied troops were evacuated from northern France during the 'Miracle of Dunkirk' in 1940.

But somehow, James May got left behind.

Undaunted, the 20-year-old soldier stole a car and managed to evade the Germans, eventually finding a skipper six days later to sail him home.

Four years on, he was back - storming the beaches of Normandy as part of Operation Neptune - and lived to tell the tale.

Now aged 93, he has finally been awarded his campaign medals - almost 68 years after peace was declared.

Reluctant hero: James May, 93, pictured with his medals at home in Dunkeswell, Devon - he didn't collect the medals for 68 years, but says he is proud to have them now

Despite his 
heroism, Mr May prefers not to dwell on his wartime experiences - and it 
was not until a neighbour in his home town of Dunkeswell in Devon asked 
to see his war medals that he felt the absence of them.

As a young man 
after the war ended, he had never bothered to claim them.

After discovering this, the neighbour began the process of applying for them on Mr May's behalf.

The six campaign medals due to him were the 1939-45 star, the War Medal, the Defence Medal, the France and 
Germany star, the
 Normandy Medal and the Dunkirk medal.

Now that he has received them, Mr May said he is proud to have the reminder of his loyal service in - and lucky escape from - two such seminal historic events of the last century.

'I was just 20 years old in 1940 - I wasn't interested in medals but I'm proud now that I have got them,' he revealed.'

Mr May said that he left London and joined the Royal Army Service Corps in 1940 as a driver with the British Expeditionary Force.Â 

He was stationed in France and was meant to evacuate with other Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbours of Dunkirk as part of 'Operation Dynamo', intended to rescue the British, French and Belgian soldiers who had been cut off by the encroaching German invaders.

But while nearly 340,000 troops were rescued by a band of 850 ships - many of which were privately owned and included motor yachts and fishing boats - May was not one of them.

Left behind, the soldier went on the run across Nazi-occupied France in a stolen car with six of his army comrades.

Six days later the group found a 
skipper who agreed to sail them back home. On the way they were still under threat, and were shadowed
 by a German U-boat before they finally came ashore on the English 
coast.

After two years 
serving in Northern Ireland, he returned to France for the Normandy landings in 
June 1944 - also known as Operation Neptune, the invasion began on D-Day, 6 June 1944, and ended on 30 June 1944.

The landings were undertaken in two 
phases - an airborne assault landing of 24,000 troops shortly after 
midnight, and an amphibious infantry landing on the coast of France 
starting at 6.30am.

In total, more than 160,000 soldiers attacked along a 50-mile stretch of coast.

The Allies swiftly established a firm foothold in Normandy, and Mr May was part of one of the great turning points for Allied fortunes in World War Two.

His role was as a driver of one of the DUKW amphibious landing vehicle known as 
'ducks'.

'It was just luck I suppose, surviving 
the war,' said Mr May.

'I was a duck driver on D-Day and when they fired the big gun 
on the back the thing nearly went over.'

He remained in the Army until 1946.

After being demobbed Mr May began working in sales, married his wife Elsie, and retired to Devon with her more than 30 years ago.

Stoic: 'He is part of that generation who are not likely to start jumping around the room over a shiny bit of metal, but I could see what it meant to him,' said Mr May's neighbour

Next-door-neighbour Jim Greenshields helped Mr May obtain his six campaign medals after a chat revealed that Mr May had nothing to show for his time in the Armed Forces.

'I used to chat to him about the war - he has been through quite a lot but doesn't really want to talk about it,' said Mr Greenshields, a flying instructor at Dunkeswell aerodrome.

'It is amazing that he was at D-day and Dunkirk - not many can say that, as I would imagine the odds of surviving both are pretty slim.'

But Mr Greenshields said that his neighbour was not one for fuss, and preferred to be stalwart about the medals.

'He is part of that generation who are not likely to start jumping around the room over a shiny bit of metal, but I could see what it meant to him.'

Hailed
 by Winston Churchill as a 'miracle of deliverance', the evacuation of 
Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk is one of the 
best-known episodes of the Second World War.

After
 British, French and Belgian troops became cut off by the advancing 
German army, some 850 ships sailed to France to rescue them.

They
 included the 'famous little ships of Dunkirk', a flotilla of about 700 
merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft and lifeboats.

Between May 27 and June 4, 1940, around 340,000 soldiers were rescued, including almost 200,000 British troops.

The
 mission, codenamed Operation Dynamo, incurred significant losses, 
however, and Churchill warned afterwards: 'Wars are not won by 
evacuations'.

The
 British premier said there was not doubt in his mind that the Allied 
operations in Western Europe prior to the evacuation had been a 
'colossal military disaster'.

Nine
 Allied destroyers - six British and three French - were sunk during 
Operation Dynamo, and more than 100 RAF aircraft were lost in the 
fighting.
