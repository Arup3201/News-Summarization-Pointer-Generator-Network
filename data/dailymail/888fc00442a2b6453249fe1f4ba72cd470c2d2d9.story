The full horror of the crash of the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rocket emerged last night as witnesses described seeing the stricken pilot who died hurtling to earth in his ejector seat.

The accident over the Mojave desert in California – which was still unexplained last night – killed American pilot Michael Alsbury and injured his co-pilot, fellow American Peter Siebold, 43, who managed to parachute from an altitude of nearly 50,000ft and amazingly survived.

But Sir Richard Branson yesterday angrily dismissed critics who said the accident was predictable due to his commercial rocket ship’s ‘crude’ design, insisting that it would be ‘irresponsible’ to comment before a full investigation.

And, astonishingly, he revealed that someone had signed up for a flight after the tragedy.

At a press conference, Branson said he hoped the crash would not scare away the 700 who have already paid for a seat.

‘We have had numerous messages of support from the people – the astronauts – who have signed up for this,’ he said. ‘We even had someone sign up yesterday in support of the programme.

‘Anybody who ever wants a refund will be able to get a refund.’

The billionaire vowed to persevere with his ambition to take tourists into space, insisting he would lead the way. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I want to be on the first flight – I will be on the first flight.’

Two men working in the desert witnessed the explosion on Friday. One, Tom Guevara, 61, described seeing Alsbury hit the ground ‘still strapped into his ejector seat and bounce back up about 150ft in the air before coming to rest’.

He said it was ‘the most awful thing I’ve ever seen’, adding: ‘It’s not something you’d want anyone thinking of flying into space to see.’

His colleague, Mick Smith, 33, added: ‘The pilot’s body hit the ground first, coming down fast without a parachute. Perhaps the chute got burned up in the explosion, or didn’t open.’

Virgin Atlantic has long been accused of ignoring warnings that its £312million rocket was unsafe.

Sir Richard Branson angrily dismissed critics who said the rocket ship's accident was predictable, vowing that he and his son would be on the first commercial space flight

Carolynne Campbell, an expert on rocket propulsion, told a newspaper last night: ‘This explosion is not a surprise. It is exactly what I was expecting. It was Russian roulette which test flight blew up.’

Warnings were issued as long ago as 2007 after a previous explosion that killed three workers. Geoff Daly, a US-based British rocket scientist, warned US officials last year of another disaster if test flights were given the go-ahead.

At the time, Virgin Galactic had planned to begin its first passenger flights in December 2013.

Sir Richard Branson’s space tourism project has been plagued with problems and delays from the outset.

He launched Virgin Galactic ten years ago, promising to take his first passengers into space three years later.

But he encountered problems in upgrading his first spacecraft and there were claims that his ‘engineers were working in the unknown’.

The first Virgin Galactic disaster hit the project in July 2007 when an early version of the nitrous oxide liquid fuel tank exploded, killing three workers. 

It has also emerged that one of Virgin’s star pilots, who left the company for a competitor, had characterised the solid rocket fuel used until recently as being unstable during tests.

And, in his recent biography of the entrepreneur, the writer Tom Bower has questioned Sir Richard’s abilities to compete in the space tourism race.

He said that Branson ‘did not appreciate the consequence of his innocence as he embarked on his final attempt to become a major player in America’.

Last night, colleagues described Alsbury, who was married, as highly respected and experienced. He had worked for Scaled Composites, Virgin’s partner company in the programme, for 13 years and was a project engineer as well as a test pilot. Siebold is a design engineer for the firm.

Alsbury’s widow Michelle last night said: ‘I have lost the love of my life. I am living in hell right now.’

Siebold’s father, Dr Klaus Siebold, said last night: ‘It’s a miracle that my son is still alive. I talked to him recently about the new fuel mixture they were testing, and he was confident that it was going to be a great advantage. He had no concerns.’

Despite Sir Richard’s determination to carry on with his project, the tragedy has cast doubt on the future of space tourism, with some suggesting his dream might be over. But the billionaire entrepreneur said: ‘Once we find out what went wrong, once the test pilots have done all the test flights needed, and once we get the licence, myself and my son will certainly accompany the first commercial flight.’

His son Sam was with him during the visit to Mojave Airport, where Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo took off on Friday morning. Before they met crash investigators, Sam was asked if he still felt comfortable joining the inaugural flight, if it ever gets off the ground. ‘I’ll leave it to my father to do the talking,’ he said.

While praising his pioneering spirit, critics have accused Branson of overstretching himself with his latest venture, which he describes as his ‘boldest yet’. Yesterday his unofficial biographer, Tom Bower, said that the crash was ‘predictable’ because Virgin was using a ‘crude rocket’, with an experimental fuel.

Mr Bower said: ‘All the engineers in California working on the project I’ve spoken to said it was very dangerous. Just a few weeks ago the last of many of the Virgin Galactic engineers walked out of the factory and said he’d never work there again.’

But Sir Richard hit back, saying: ‘I find it slightly irresponsible that people who know nothing are saying things before the National Transportation Safety Board make their comments. We are determined to find out what went wrong... This is the biggest test programme ever carried out in commercial aviation history, precisely to ensure that this never happens to the public.

‘In testing the boundaries of human capabilities and technologies we are standing on the shoulders of giants. Yesterday we fell short.’

It could be months before the cause of the disaster is known.

Yesterday debris littered the scrubland chaparral dotted with dunes and Joshua trees near Cantil.Residents were evacuated from homes near to where the spaceship’s fuel tank fell, amid fears of further explosions and toxic poisoning.

After the blast, Mr Smith said he saw the spaceship ‘coming down, spiralling and trailing gas, as if it was leaking fuel. It didn’t look as though it was on fire. There was no explosion when it hit the ground. It just shattered apart’.

His colleague added: ‘The pilot’s ejector seat left a huge crater beside the road. We raced over to see if there was anything we could do. But the pilot was beyond help.’

The shattered tail section of SpaceShipTwo lay in pieces nearby, the word ‘Virgin’ visible on the torn metal.

Initial suspicions for the tragedy focused on a new mix of fuel being tested for the first time in flight. The accident occurred as SpaceShipTwo fired up its rockets.

Voyagers: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are among celebrities with tickets

It remains to be seen how many of the celebrities who paid £156,000 to blast into space with Branson will take up his offer of a refund.

More than 700 wealthy passengers – among them Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Justin Bieber – have booked seats on the first flights, which had been expected to begin next year.

While some are said to remain committed, many are expected to pull out quietly.

However, ticket-holder Jon Goodwin, 68, a retired British businessman and former Olympic canoeist, said the crash had not deterred him.

He said: ‘I am confident this will go ahead. Of course it came to me as a shock, it stopped me in my tracks – I could have been one of those people who was killed. But I am utterly confident the people in the Mojave desert will rectify the problem and I will fly and I am totally confident it will be totally safe before I do so.’

Other stars set to fly are Ashton Kutcher, Lady Gaga, Tom Hanks, Princess Beatrice and Katy Perry. 

So is it just a waste of time? 

The first space tourists will experience just five minutes of weightlessness on their flight, at the boundary of the Earth’s atmosphere and outer space.

One critic likened it to a ‘high-altitude bungee jump’, while astronaut Chris Hadfield, who flew two Shuttle missions, questioned whether the trip was worth the ticket price, saying: ‘It’s not much of a space flight.’
