The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested an Indiana man on Thursday night for threatening to kill House Speaker John Boehner.

Bernard J. Thompson, 32, was arrested for 'allegedly making email and telephone threats to an elected official,' according to a statement issued by the FBI.

''I’m coming after your oompa loompa f***ing husband. He should … he 
shoulda extended unemployment insurance. Now it’s too late. Imma rip his
 f***ing head off,' a man believed to be Thompson said in a message left on Boehner's wife's cell phone.

The FBI arrested an Indiana man on Thursday night for allegedly making threats on House Speaker John Boehner's life, including leaving a message on Boehner's wife's cell phone for the Speaker that said 'Imma f***ing rip his head off'

Roll Call reports that Thompson has admitted to making threats on Boehner's life.

Thompson was upset with Boehner and other House Republicans for declining to extend unemployment benefits. He was reportedly receiving checks from the government until January 11, when his unemployment insurance ran out.

Authorities believe he is the same man who has been leaving threatening messages on of Boehner's wife's cell phone for the past month.

Thompson reportedly made 19 calls between April 8 and May 6 to Debbie Boehner. She first reported the messages to Capitol Police on May 1. She again reported the threats on Tuesday, May 6.

'I’m going to rip his f***ing head off. He’s not untouchable, I will get my hands on him,' a phone message said.

Thompson is also accused of leaving a threatening message on Boehner's website.

A comment believed to be posted by Thompson reads:

'WELL YOU DRUNK JOHN BIN LADEN IT’S TIME TO TAKE YOU OUT 
MOTHERF***** YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH 2.7 MILLION PEOPLES LIVES I AM GOING 
TO TAKE YOURS YOU WILL NEVER SEE IT COMING WITH MY SNIPLE RIFLE WERE YOU

Free
 speech is the cornerstone of our democracy but threats of violence have
 no place in our civil society.  People who are inclined to make them 
need to know that they violate the law and they will be aggressively 
pursued.Read more at http://fox59.com/2014/05/09/fbi-arrests-new-castle-man-accused-of-threatening-public-official/#FkBSAqm2kkwI3wD2.99

The message came from an IP address registered to Thompson's neighbor, but police believe Thompson used the neighbor's wireless Internet signal to leave the message.

The neighbor told authorities that four years ago Thompson pulled a gun on debt collectors.

The accused has owns a concealed carry permit, the FBI says, which indicates that he may own a firearm.

He does not have criminal record, the FBI said, however Roll Call reports that he has had five protective orders filed against him since 2001.

In announcing Thompson's arrest, U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Hogsett said in a statement on Friday,'Free speech is the cornerstone of our democracy but threats of violence have no place in our civil society.'

'People who are inclined to make them need to know that they violate the law and they will be aggressively pursued.'
