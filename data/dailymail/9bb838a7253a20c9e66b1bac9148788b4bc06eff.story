As Christmas draws near, Manchester United are back on familiar territory. A Barclays Premier League title race that was only expected to feature two contenders suddenly has a third team loitering with intent at the head of the chasing pack.

Statistically, at least, United appear to be in a reasonable position. Third in the league on the back of a six-game winning run, their improvement has been enough to prompt captain Wayne Rooney to suggest this week that a 21st title triumph could yet be theirs.

With the busy festive period now on the horizon, what are the reasons for United’s improvement and can manager Louis van Gaal really  take his team all the way in the first half of 2015?

WINNING IS A HABIT

United’s form has, in all honesty, been rather up and down. In his more candid moments, Van Gaal probably realises that he could count the number of really convincing performances on the fingers of one hand and still have room for a mince pie.

However, there were signs against Liverpool at Old Trafford last Sunday that suggested, for the first time in a long time, that United had rediscovered the belief that was always there during the Sir Alex Ferguson years.

United weren’t comprehensively better than Liverpool in winning 3-0, but at no point did you think they would lose. On the counter, United played with a conviction and edge that always suggested that, whatever happened in their own penalty box, they would manage to put it right in the other one.

It was not dissimilar to the way Liverpool themselves felt at the back end of last season and look what it almost did for them.

BIG NAMES BACK LVG

As David Moyes discovered to his cost last season, a playing squad that isn’t fully behind its manager can quickly fall apart. Conversely, a less-than-perfect group of players can over-achieve if they are driven forwards by a close bond and a belief in what their coach is doing.

This time last year, senior players at Old Trafford — such as Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic — already had serious reservations about Moyes and Ferguson’s successor suffered as a consequence.

So far this time, Van Gaal has had no such problems and, crucially, he has quickly gained and maintained the trust and support of players such as Rooney, Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher.

Players in the United dressing room listen to these voices and it is the Old Trafford squad’s belief in their coach that has, for example, enabled Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young to perform much better as emergency wing backs than anybody ever expected.

These things can make a difference, especially during periods of transition. The decision to hand Rooney the captaincy was a clever one and it is paying off in terms of the England skipper’s performances and day-to-day influence.

An example of Rooney’s current approach is that when Van Gaal called him back to the training ground from an appointment on Merseyside to talk about a forthcoming game a month ago, the 29-year-old didn’t bat an eyelid.

IGNORE THE CRITICS

Van Gaal has made mistakes since he arrived at United. He still seems confused about what system he wishes to play and he probably should have bought another central defender in the summer. 

Nevertheless, the Dutch coach has brought an authority and a conviction to the club that is already serving him well.

United managers — just like their contemporaries at clubs like Spurs and Liverpool — will never be short of ex-coaches and players telling the world exactly what they are doing wrong.

Van Gaal has had plenty of that, but those who know him stress that he doesn’t even hear it, never mind pay attention to it.

Van Gaal can certainly get jumpy in press conferences and doesn’t like being reminded of things that have gone awry. But the key quality that the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach possesses is to forget all about it as soon as he has walked out of the room.

He is 100 per cent convinced that what he is doing is correct and that kind of self-belief is something you cannot buy.

RIDE YOUR LUCK

United have had a dreadful run with injuries and only time will tell if any of that is down to Van Gaal’s methods. The United manager has been fortunate, however, that a tiny pocket of players he really needs have managed to stay fit.

Rooney is certainly one of those — for many reasons — while David de Gea is another. The goalkeeper is on one of those runs of form that you can only dream about.

His performances against Arsenal and Liverpool not only earned his team victories, but actually stopped them losing. 

Take six points off United’s tally of 31 in the Premier League and Van Gaal’s record would look identical to that of Moyes a year ago and would see them outside the top six with only two points more than Newcastle.

That is how fine the margins are in English football these days.

Van Gaal and his staff will rightly claim an influence on their goalkeeper’s form — coach Frans Hoek has previously worked with Victor Valdes, Pepe Reina and Edwin van der Sar — but if a keeper is saving your skin on a regular basis then it’s best to close your eyes and hope it continues.

NO EUROPE

Despite the horrors of last season, perhaps the one big favour Moyes did for United before he left was ensure they didn’t qualify for the Europa League. United’s balance sheet may miss the income from regular European games but Van Gaal and his players should be grateful they don’t have the distraction. 

With the United squad creaking under the weight of injuries, one can only imagine what may have happened had they had Europa League commitments to cope with too.

While we are on the subject, the 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat at MK Dons that seemed to spell crisis back in August no longer looks like the worst result in the world either. United’s constant stream of free weeks has given them vital breathing space so far.

TITLE CHANCES?

So far they have not suggested they are good enough to lift the league title, especially when you consider the quality and depth of the two squads above them. United have dug very deep to find a good run of form and Van Gaal and his players deserve credit for that.

However, it must be said that United’s performances in taking 18 points from games against Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Hull, Stoke, Southampton and Liverpool probably merited about half of that total on balance of play and opportunities.

Good finishing and outstanding goalkeeping will only carry you so far and Van Gaal knows he still has issues to address in the days and weeks to come. 

His team struggle to keep possession for long periods and the defence — still missing some players — continues to look far too porous, particularly between the central defenders. It is worth noting that Moyes was still being asked if his team could win the title as United put together a six-game winning streak in all competitions this time last year. And look what happened to him.
