Brendan Rodgers has been written off way too quickly, even by some Liverpool fans. Liverpool’s results, performances, character, signings and selections can all be questioned and the manager deserves some criticism. But is now the right time to be judging Rodgers as a failure? In my view that would be harsh.

The critics have put last season’s massive improvement down to Luis Suarez. There have been plenty of teams who have had a special player who didn’t achieve what Liverpool did last season (look at Spurs with Gareth Bale as a recent example). It was so much more than that, and Rodgers deserves his share of the credit for taking a team from a bang average seventh-place finish in 2012-13, to within a whisker of the title last season.

He’s got a lot wrong this season, but in my view, January is going to be a massive month for the Liverpool boss. With Suarez going, he needed to bring the right strikers in during the summer, and that didn’t happen.

That business up front was mystifying. Rickie Lambert was only ever going to be a squad player. Wilfred Bony and Loic Remy both looked destined for Liverpool but for reasons not made totally clear neither deal happened. And everyone thought Fabio Borini was leaving, only for the player himself to change his mind at the last moment. The Mario Balotelli move looked a little desperate, and so it has proved.

So through mishap and bad fortune Liverpool have been left with one top-level striker. And he’s injured.

If Rodgers can address the problem in the window, I think he has a good opportunity to turn Liverpool’s season around. Assuming everyone sticks together, including the captain.

The focus has been on Steven Gerrard recently – what’s his best position? Should he be dropped? What about a new contract?

Well hang on a second. It’s not all about one player, and considering it was Gerrard’s unfortunate slip that cost Liverpool last season – and cost Rodgers a place in history - I think the captain (in my opinion the greatest player in Liverpool’s rich history) should not even be mentioning a new deal, as he did in an interview with Sportsmail in October, when he needs to get his own game sorted out – his club needs him doing it out there, not talking about contracts.

The deal has been offered, so once it’s signed that should be the end of that issue.

In my view, a manager who stood by Gerrard when so many were hammering him after that slip, deserves support from his captain. Times were tough for Gerrard back in April and Rodgers gave him total backing. Times are now tough for Rodgers, so the captain needs to return the favour to his boss.

Like Everton across the way, Liverpool Football Club has always shown a remarkable ability to stick together and support each other. If someone strays away from that, they are criticised. Right now, scrutiny of Rodgers’ ability is understandable. But a captain seemingly focused on a new deal instead of his football isn’t helping the manager.

With that crucial Basle game around the corner, Gerrard needs his big game mentality – he’s done it before on massive Champions League occasions, and Liverpool will need him to do it again.

It’s the least Rodgers deserves from his skipper. Win that and suddenly the pressure will ease a little bit.

And if Rodgers is allowed to follow it up with some shrewd wheeling and dealing in January, he can re-establish his reputation once again.
