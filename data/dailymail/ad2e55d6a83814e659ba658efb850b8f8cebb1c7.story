A two pence piece that was accidentally made in the wrong metal is set to sell for 50,000 times its face value.

The coin was struck in cupronickel, the blend of copper and nickel formerly used for 10p and 5p coins, when it should have been bronze.

The errant coin, thought to be unique, was discovered in 1988, by the owner of a petrol station in a roll of new coins.

The rare two pence piece, which is made in the wrong metal, which is set to sell for up to £1,000 when it is auctioned next week 

It is thought that a cupronickel blank had been left in the barrel during the minting process by mistake.

Richard Brommell, from Charterhouse Auctions, believes the coin could fetch up to £1,000 when it is auctioned in Sherborne, Dorset, on Friday.

He said: ‘It’s a conversation piece and a curio. The Royal Mint can produce the odd anomaly but this takes the biscuit. It’s a very difficult thing to value because there are no comparables.

‘We say £100 to £200 as an estimate, but if two people are bidding for it, the coin could go for more than £1,000.’
