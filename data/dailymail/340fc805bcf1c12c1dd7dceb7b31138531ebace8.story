A pilot crashed an experimental, homemade aircraft into the woods near an airport runway just moments after take off.

Andrew Liptak, 73, from North Carolina was in the Velocity aircraft when he saw the pilot door open and tried to make a u-turn and land at Sebastian Municipal Airport in Florida. 

The plane, which he had purchased just two weeks before, then plummeted towards the trees.

Golfers playing on adjacent course heard the aircraft crash and called the police.

Scene: Andrew Liptak, 73, from North Carolina was in the Velocity aircraft when he saw the pilot door open and tried to make a u-turn and land at Sebastian Municipal Airport in Florida. It then plummeted towards the trees 

They arrived at the scene and dragged Mr Lpitak out of the cockpit. He was taken to hospital but escaped without serious injury.  

John Abraham, chief pilot of Velocity, told the Scripps Treasure Coast Newspaper group: 'He could have continued flying, but he tried to make a 180-degree turn to land, and he hit the ground, went into the trees and totaled the plane.

Richard Ilg of Sebastian, was practicing on the driving range when he heard a loud bang which he said sounded like a car crash, he said.

He told the paper: 'I could hear the engine cut out. There was no smoke, but you knew what it was.'

The FAA confirmed in its preliminary report that a door had opened in flight. It is still investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash. 

The aircrafts cost between $34,650 and $110,000 to put together, depending on the kit purchased. 

A description reads: 'The Velocity is a true high performance airplane with the ability to make 1000 mile cross country trips at speeds in excess of 200 MPH – while carrying four adults and baggage in total comfort. With the rear mounted engine, the noise, propeller turbulence, engine heat and fumes are behind you, providing an atmosphere comparable to a modern sports sedan. 

'An adequate supply of cool fresh air is available through forward inlets; this air can also be heated by the forward mounted oil cooler.'

Response: An EMT is seen preparing a stretcher next the crash site. The pilot was the only person on board at the time of the crash and was taken to hospital 

An air ambulance is parked on a field near the Florida airport. Golfers playing on an adjacent course called 911 after hearing the plane crash into surrounding trees
