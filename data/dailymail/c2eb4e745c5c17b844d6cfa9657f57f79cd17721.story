The widow of disgraced publisher Robert Maxwell has died in France aged 92.

Betty Maxwell remained loyal to her husband until his death in 1991 and had no forewarning of the shameful legacy he would leave his family.

It was she and their seven surviving children who were left to face the music after the media mogul’s mysterious death after disappearing off his luxury yacht.

‘The fat fraudster’, as his daughter-in-law Pandora later referred to him, left the family’s reputation in tatters – and a £460million black hole in the pension fund of Maxwell’s Mirror Group Newspapers.

Two of Maxwell’s sons most closely involved in the family firm, Kevin and Ian, stood trial accused of taking part in the fraud. They were acquitted.

Yet during Maxwell’s lifetime, Betty had been the unstintingly supportive wife, acting as hostess and housekeeper at their Oxfordshire mansion, Headington Hill Hall.

She would often step in at the last moment and take his place at receptions and dinners, when he petulantly refused to go.

She cushioned their children against his
dictatorial rages and his warped habit of subjecting them to stinging 
criticism one minute and affectionate praise the next.

Robert Maxwell was born in Czechoslovakia and rose from poverty to build an extensive publishing empire.

After spending six years as an MP during the 1960s, he bought Mirror Group Newspapers, among other publishing companies.

He led an extremely flamboyant lifestyle and was also often embroiled in controversy.  

Maxwell was forced to sell some of his successful businesses in 1989 to cover his enormous debts.

But it was only after his death two years later - after apparently falling overboard from his yacht - that the full picture of his financial mess was uncovered.

With banks calling in huge loans, his publishing empire collapsed.

But things became much worse when it emerged Maxwell had stolen hundreds of millions of pounds from his own companies' pension funds to save the firms from bankruptcy.

Two of Maxwell’s sons most closely 
involved in the family firm, Kevin and Ian, stood trial accused of taking part 
in the fraud but were acquitted.

Born Elisabeth Jenny Jeanne Meynard at La Grive, near Lyon in France, in 1921, Mrs Maxwell worked tirelessly for good causes.

The daughter of a French protestant father and a Roman Catholic mother, who married the Jewish Maxwell, she committed herself to improving relations between faiths.

Fiercely intelligent and Sorbonne-educated, she was noted for her contributions to Holocaust studies, and earned the respect of members of the Jewish and Christian communities around the world.

She met Czechoslovakian-born Maxwell in Paris after the Liberation in 1944. He was serving in the British army.

Years later, when he was Labour MP for Buckingham, she was described as a first-class constituency MP’s wife.

She went on to take a degree at Oxford after suffering years of being branded ignorant and stupid by her husband, often in front of strangers.

Three years after his death in 1991, she published a memoir about her roller-coaster life with Bob Maxwell, and in her latter years she lectured widely on Holocaust studies around the world.

She developed a heart condition and finished her life in France.

She died on Wednesday, and is survived by three sons and four daughters.
