Phil Neville made his first cup of coffee for Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton as the pair sat down to talk about his time coaching at Manchester United, life as a commentator and more.

Former Manchester United and England star Phil Neville has failed to tackle a single piece of housework during his 15-year marriage, his wife has revealed.

The football pundit, who has just made his first cup of coffee at the age of 37, has no idea where the ironing board is kept and would not know how to turn on an oven.

'All his talent is in his toes, that's for certain,' a remarkably sanguine Julie Neville said.

With news of his relaxed attitude to housework floating around social media, Neville took the opportunity to poke fun at himself on Twitter.

The former Everton utility man tweeted an image of himself with a vacuum cleaner, a mop and a variety of cleaning products, along with the caption: 'Time to get started......#nescafe'.

Neville, who played 59 times for England and won six Premier League titles with United, first hinted at his lack of skill around the house on BBC Radio 5 at the weekend.

He said he 'sprinted into the kitchen' and phoned his wife to ask 'how the hell do I make a cup of coffee' after the Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton asked for one during an interview at the couple's £3.6million Cheshire home.

The father of two later told how he made it with a 'kettle… two little scoops of coffee', and laughed: 'I've lived in a bubble all my life.'

His wife then revealed in a separate radio interview that he had never used a vacuum cleaner, mop, dishwasher or washing machine.

And on Monday, when asked if he had any redeeming talents around the house such as putting the rubbish out or mowing the lawn, she said he did neither.

She added: 'Ironing? Oh gosh no, he wouldn't even know where we keep the ironing board… He wouldn't know how to turn an oven on.

'I've never known anything else and I'm super-domestic so I don't really mind. Phil is an amazing father and husband – just not domesticated in any way.'

Speaking about her husband's first attempt to make a cup of coffee, the 39-year-old said: 'If you'd seen it you would not have thought it was classed as a coffee. I didn't taste it, but it didn't look good.'

But Sportsmail's Lawton was more generous, saying: 'For a first go, it was very good.' 

As for Neville, he has insisted he would 'never drink the stuff' anyway but confirmed that he has made tea.
