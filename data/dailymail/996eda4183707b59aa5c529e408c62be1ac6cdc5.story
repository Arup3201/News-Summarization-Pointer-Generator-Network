Dermatologist Dr Michael Prager performs two laser hair treatments on men's feet each day. He said the number of men having the procedure has doubled in the last year

Rising numbers of men are having laser treatment to remove hair from their ‘Hobbit feet’, according to doctors.

They say trends for wearing flip-flops and sandals have made men increasingly self-conscious about the look of their legs.

At one private clinic in London, the numbers coming forward for the £700 treatment to remove hair have doubled in the past year.

Dr Michael Prager, a dermatologist based just off Harley Street, says he performs two sessions each day on men worried about looking like Hobbits from JRR Tolkien’s fantasy novels, in which they are described as having feet covered with curly hair and thick, leathery soles, making shoes unnecessary.

He said: ‘The fashion has changed: men show more leg and they want their feet to look good. I think what you’ll see soon is a trend for men to have no leg hair as well.’

Margaret Dabbs, a foot expert with clinics in Britain and Dubai, said the number of male clients had grown substantially over the past few months.

It takes about eight sessions of up to an hour to remove the hair from men’s lower legs and feet.

The treatment involves using a laser that damages the follicles and prevents hair growth. The hair will normally grow back within a few months or years depending on the individual.

Although it is often referred to as ‘permanent’, the hair will normally grow back within a few months or years depending on the individual.

Ms Dabbs said: ‘It used to mainly be metrosexual men, but we now have the whole spectrum.

Men are paying up to £700 to have foot hair removed in preparation for flip-flop season. Patients are said to be seeking professional help to avoid the hairy 'Hobbit feet' effect, that make-up artists created for Martin Freeman in the Hobbit (pictured right)

‘We have lawyers, company owners, MPs, even royalty.’

This is the latest trend that suggests men are becoming increasingly proud about their bodies.

In January, the Private Clinic on 
London’s Harley street reported that the numbers going under the knife 
to have their so-called ‘man boobs’ removed had risen by 38 per cent in a
year.

Dr Dennis Wolf one of the specialist doctors said: ‘I have certainly noticed an increase in the number of men who come to me to find out more about male chest reduction procedures.

‘Today men are more aware of the treatments available to them and are more open to the possibility of undergoing a cosmetic procedure in a bid to get the shape and the physique that they would like.’

Men account for ten per cent of all cosmetic surgery procedures - which doesn’t include laser treatment - according to the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons.
