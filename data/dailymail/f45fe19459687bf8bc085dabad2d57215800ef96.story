Two people were killed as a fire ripped through a cruise liner yesterday.

Four others were reported missing and nine were injured after a fireball engulfed the engine room of the vessel.

More than 100 passengers scrambled  into lifeboats to evacuate before the ship reached port.

With smoke still billowing, the rest of those on board then frantically made their escape.

Three Sea King helicopters, two coastguard ships, a rescue ship and firemen were dispatched to the scene. More than 260  people were on board the MS Nordlys when it caught fire off Alesund, 230 miles northwest of the Norwegian capital Oslo.

Police sealed off parts of Alesund because of the heavy smoke.

Fire chief Geir Thorsen said: ‘It was so  hot that our gloves were burning as we touched the railings. All the smoke also made it very challenging.’

Three British couples, aged between 50 and 60, had been travelling on the liner. They were badly shaken, but safe, said Andy Farstad, a local businessman and honorary British consul.

The two killed were crew  members. Dr Odd Vedding, medical director at Alesund Hospital, said two further crew members had been very badly burned.

‘Both of them were put on inhalators for lung damage from smoke inhalation,’ he said. ‘One was  then flown to nearby Bergen where  they have specialists for these type of injuries.’

The other injured people were also suffering smoke inhalation from the fire, which continued to burn late into yesterday afternoon.

The Nordlys was travelling along a popular cruise route up the  fjord-dotted western coast of  Norway. The line carries tourists eager to see the spectacular western coast and locals from coastal cities and towns.
