What could be worse than minus degree weather?

Watching Frozen on repeat, according to one Disney-ed-out mother.

Odessa Waters, who is currently snowed-in at home with her daughter in North Carolina, created a comical video to vent her frustration.

Her mix of facial expressions indicate that she's definitely at her wits' end.

'If I ever could choke some cartoon characters, it would be them,' Waters says after reciting some of the Frozen cast.

She continues her tirade while exhaustively rolling her eyes: 'I'd kill them if I could.' 

Meanwhile, her daughter enthusiastically sings the Frozen song 'Let it Go' in the background.

Waters says she's been stuck in the house for five day so far hearing about the animation non-stop.

'[I] don't even like going in their room because the theme is Frozen too. I definitely feel your pain.'

Let's hope the snow lifts in North Carolina soon!
