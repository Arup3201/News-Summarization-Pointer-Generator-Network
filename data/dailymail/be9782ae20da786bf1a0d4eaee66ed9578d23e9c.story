With Louis van Gaal embroiled in Holland’s preparations for the World Cup Finals, it may be a while before Manchester United supporters get to see their new manager at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal will finally be confirmed as United’s new boss this week but will remain at Holland’s training base 60 miles outside of Amsterdam ahead of the weekend friendly with Ecuador.

In advance of his unveiling by the deposed Barclays Premier League champions, however, Van Gaal would appear to have some encouragement for Ryan Giggs and indeed captain-elect Robin van Persie in terms of their own futures at Old Trafford.

Big job: Louis van Gaal has plenty of work to do when he takes over at Manchester United

In an interview talking about his philosophies and principles, Van Gaal has revealed how he always likes to keep one member of the club’s coaching staff on his team and that he likes to appoints captains that he knows and likes.

‘When I go to a new club, I always want to keep one coach from the existing staff,’ said Van Gaal. ‘At my last club Bayern that person was Herman Kerland, who is still working under Pep Guardiola now.‘I wanted to know who was coming through the youth system — and he is the man who said to me: “Muller, Badstuber and Alaba. These are the players”. So I let them train with the first team, I observed them — and then I decided where they were going to play.

‘As for the captains, this is more based on characteristics, which is very important for me. I choose the captain, not the players.

‘I’m always choosing the captains of my team. I have to live with them and give them more responsibility. I have to admire him also because of his personality, his identity. My captains are very professional, but also very ambitious and honest. You can see these qualities in the captains I have chosen.

All smiles: Ryan Giggs could remain at the club next season

‘Age is not important. When I moved to Barcelona, Guardiola was 27-years-old. Traditionally in Spain, the captains are the eldest players. I wanted to give him responsibility and transfer my philosophy. I have to click with my captains.

‘I told Pep “You have to be my captain.” He said: “No, no.” I told him: “I choose the captain and you understand the game how I understand the game.” That’s why I made him my captain. You can see what he is now.’

United have not confirmed Van Gaal as their new manager yet as they are continuing to talk to him about his coaching staff. Giggs, recently serving as the club’s interim manager, is likely to be offered a role but it remains to be seen if he will stay.

Van Gaal will speak at the Dutch training camp this afternoon but journalists from UK newspapers have been told they cannot attend.

He has admitted, though, that he missed the day-to-day contact with players during his second stint with Holland and it is clear he will attempt to bring attacking football back to Old Trafford next season.

‘I think it’s my philosophy that makes me successful because it binds players with my training and in my career I have had a lot of players who are fascinated by that philosophy,’ he said.

‘They find it nice to take part in it because it’s attacking, technical and tactical. They can show their qualities more than ever.

‘The characteristics come back to my point on vision. You have to play as a team and not as individuals. That’s why I’m always going back to the vision, then the team, and then which players fit in my system, a 4-3-3, because I’m always playing that.

‘If a young player can do it, then I select him. If it’s an older player, it doesn’t bother me; it’s not the most important factor. Age is not important.

‘I miss the club work every day. I said once in a press conference that I don’t like that part and the Netherlands were...well, it was not good for me to say it.

‘But I said it because of this. I used to be a physical education teacher because I loved communicating with young people. Now don’t always have that. I have to select, watch, observe and I only have contact with my players about eight times a year. That is what I don’t like.’
