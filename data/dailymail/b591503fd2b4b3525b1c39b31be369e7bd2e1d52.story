A man who displayed signs of mental health problems as a teenager has been locked up by his parents for 30 years.

Dong Hai,46, was caged in a five square metre stone shelter in his parent's back yard when they grew frightened that he could hurt someone.

Dong Watou and his wife Xiao Hong from Longhai, southeast China's Fujian Province said they had appealed to hospitals for help when their only son grew distressed and they feared for his mental health.

Caged: Xiao Hong uses a hole in the stone wall to wash her son Dong Hai inside the stone cage with a cloth

Trapped: Dong Hai crouches in the darkened corner of his stone cell, where his parents keep him locked away from the world

Desperation: The Chinese couple looked for help and tried to get their son treatment when he displayed symptoms of mental health problems, but they were turned away by local hospitals

They visited hospitals in the 
province but were turned away. The couple spent all their savings on 
medical treatment in a year and had to stop their son's treatment.

As time goes on the couple, who are now nearly 70 years old, say their greatest fear is what will happen to Hai when they die.

The couple's house is no different from others in the village, except the stone shelter in the yard.Â 

Hai hasn't stepped outside the bare hut for the past 30 years

Food is passed to him through a hole 
in the wall and each day Hai's father uses a scoop, which is tied on top
of a long bamboo pole, to shovel out excrement.

Inhumane: Dong Waitou peeks through a hole in the stone wall to check on his son, who has not left the stone hut in 30 years

Distant: Food is served in a tin can and passed through the hole in the wall. Hai receives no physical contact despite living just yards from his elderly parents

Watchful: Hai's parents stare at him through bars, but do not touch him. They say their greatest fear is what will happen to their son once they die

Hai's mother then squirts water inside to clean the ground and her son.

Several years ago, the land in the 
village has been taken away by the government for real estate 
development, and the old couple lost their only income source.

Now they are doing odd jobs in maintaining the life.

Last year Dong Waitou worked as a 
watchman in a village construction lot, and was beaten by a drunk 
driver. Now his right leg still has a long scar and he can't do heavy 
jobs.

Held back: Dong Watou was beaten up by a drunk driver, who left him with nasty scars (right) He now struggles to work and his family find it hard to make ends meet

Drastic: the couple say deciding to cage their son was the hardest choice they've ever made
