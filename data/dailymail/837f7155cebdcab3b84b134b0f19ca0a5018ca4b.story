A buzz of excitement is surrounding the Long Island race track where California Chrome could become the first Triple Crown winner since 1978 tomorrow.

The possibility that the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes could extend his winning streak to New York's Belmont Park is expected to attract thousands more visitors.

Belmont Park's director Martin Panza has been preparing for the extra attention California Chrome has brought, and has been adding extra seating, security and bathroom facilities.

Nearby businesses are profiting from the

anticipating an increase in customers.

California Chrome's chance to make it into the record books has coincided with a relaunch at the Belmont track.

New management have filled the undercard with high-stakes races, which increased the day's total purse to $8 million - the second-richest day in American horse racing behind the final slate of the Breeder's Cup.

It has also planned to surround the action with music from rapper LL Cool J, former New York Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams, and Frank Sinatra Jr singing New York, New York.

'For the first year of us doing this, under this new format, it's not going to get any better than this,' Panza said in an interview near his track office, which was filled with boxes of Belmont Stakes caps and bags of souvenirs.

'From our end, what we need to do now is observe how the day goes and see what we can do for next year, always thinking that there could be another Triple Crown on the line.'

California Chrome is the twelfth horse to reach Long Island with wins in the first two legs of the Triple Crown, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, since Affirmed won all three in 1978.

Attendance for those 11 races averaged nearly 30,000 more than in years without a contender - going from a low of 37,171 in 1995 when Thunder Gulch and Timber Country split the Derby and the Preakness, to a record 120,139 in 2004 when Birdstone upset Smarty Jones in the last of a three-year stretch of Triple Crown contenders in the Belmont Stakes.

On-site wagering on the race-day program also surged in those years, according to track records, jumping from $6.8 million in contender-less 1996 to $9.2 million the following year when Silver Charm took the first two races, and from $8.8 million in contender-less 2007 to $13.3 million when Big Brown raced for history in 2008.

I'll Have Another's wins in Louisville and Baltimore sent attendance for the 2012 Belmont Stakes to nearly 86,000 and on-site wagering to $13.8 million even though the horse was withdrawn the day before the race due to a leg injury.

The head of the track's management team said ticket sales for this year's Belmont Stake were already brisk before California Chrome broke from the gate at Churchill Downs in May.

More than 70 percent of tickets and premium tables for the race were sold before the Derby, and all were gone before the Preakness, according to New York Racing Association president and chief executive officer Christopher Kay.

After the Preakness, Kay said, they added a track-side tent and additional seating to accommodate the surge of interest in a potential California Chrome coronation.

General admission and grandstand tickets costing $10 remained available through the track late in the week and more than 3,000 tickets, ranging from $12 for grandstand to $2,300 for a table for two at the Garden Terrace Restaurant, were available on the secondary ticket sales website StubHub.com.

Good weather - 82F and sunny, according to the National Weather Service - could push the crowd into record territory.

'Our intent is to make Belmont Stakes day an important day year in and year out,' Kay said.

This year it has been an important day for business.

The largest hotel on Long Island, a Marriott with more than 600 rooms in Uniondale, and the ornate Garden City Hotel -  where management said all of the owners, trainers and jockeys in the Belmont Stakes were staying and where the menu includes a cocktail named for each horse - have sold out under race-related demand.

Other hotels were also booked solid, officials said, forcing some out-of-town fans to find lodging in Suffolk County, about 20 miles east, or stay in Manhattan, about 15 miles west.

'This Triple Crown opportunity doesn't come too often,' state hotel association chairman John Tsunis said. 'But, whoever wins in the race, the real winners will be Long Island and New York State.'
