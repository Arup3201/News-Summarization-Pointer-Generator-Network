A volunteer medic tweeted ‘I’m dying’ after she was shot in the throat, as violence exploded on the streets of Kiev again yesterday.

Olesia Zhukovska, 21, was able to send the message just moments before she lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital for an emergency lifesaving operation.

A shocking photograph of Ms Zhukovska being led from the protests on Independence Square with blood seeping from a neck wound has since gone viral, being shared thousands of times.

Shocking: This photograph of Ms Zhukovska being led from the protests with blood seeping from a neck wound has been shared thousands of times online

The 21-year-old was able to send this tweet, which reads 'I'm dying', just moments before she lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital for an operation

In the photograph Ms Zhukovska, a volunteer medic working with EuroMaidan protesters, can be seen clutching her mobile phone as blood soaks into her scarf and white medical vest.

The tweet she sent would have been sent around this time as Ms Zhukovska reportedly lost concioseness shortly after leaving Independent Square.It is believed she was subsequently taken to Kiev’s Number 17 hospital, before being moved the Institute of Neurosurgery.

Lawmaker Iryna Herashchenko of UDAR party visited her in hospital yesterday evening, reportedly telling the Kiev Post: ‘She gained consciousness already’.

Ms Zhukovska’s profile on Maidaners media project suggests she has been a part of the protests in Kiev since they first erupted back in November.

Although she returned to her hometown of Kremenets in Ternopil Oblast in January, she caught a bus back into Kiev two days ago as the violence grew, according to her profile.

Just 20 minutes before she was shot, Ms Zhukovska wrote online: ‘We need your support. The carnage started this morning. It can turn worse later in the day.

The incident comes as the bodies of 20 civilians lay strewn on the ground after riot police were authorised to use live ammunition in place of rubber bullets. There were reports of snipers firing at protesters.

And, in a chilling twist, the demonstrators took at least 67 police officers hostage, according to Ukraine’s interior ministry.

As many as 70 are believed to have died and up to 500 injured – on what was supposed to be a day of mourning for those killed earlier this week.

A protest doctor told AP that at least 70 protesters were killed Thursday and over 500 were wounded in the clashes - and that the death toll could well rise further

Protesters hurled petrol bombs and paving slabs at police in a three-hour battle to recapture Independence Square, where former hotels have become makeshift mortuaries.

Just hours earlier President Viktor Yanukovych had agreed a truce with opposition leaders ‘with the aim of ending bloodshed’.

But after the Ukrainian leader met an EU delegation of German, Polish and French foreign ministers to discuss a ‘road map’ to peace, demonstrators held police captive in Kiev’s occupied city hall.

The country’s parliament building and the foreign ministry were evacuated because of fears that protesters would storm them.

Last night, the EU imposed sanctions on senior Ukrainian figures as Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the violence as ‘utterly unacceptable and indefensible’.

Prime Minister David Cameron made an urgent telephone call to Russian president Vladimir Putin urging him to get behind the plan for negotiations put forward by the European foreign ministers in Kiev.

The opposition is insisting on Yanukovych's resignation and an early election while the embattled president is apparently prepared to fight until the end

A Downing street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister agreed with President Putin that they should both encourage all sides in Ukraine to get behind this emerging plan as a way to end the violence and open the way to a lasting peaceful solution.’

As the carnage intensified yesterday, footage on Ukrainian television showed protesters being cut down by gunfire amid the burning wreckage of the city’s streets.

At least 21 bodies were counted on the edge of the smouldering protest encampment in central Kiev and one policeman had been shot 28 times, according to reports.

Dozens of bullet-riddled bodies were seen by reporters laid out in white sheets on the marble floors of hotels around Independence Square, known as Maidan.

As support for President Yanukovych began to crumble, there were reports of his family and top officials leaving the country with suitcases of cash.

There were varying estimates of the death toll yesterday. But Dr Oleh Musiy, the top medical coordinator for the opposition, said at least 70 demonstrators were killed and more than 500 injured.

It was reported that 28 were killed and more than 500 wounded in fighting earlier this week.

The government blamed the opposition, saying the ‘calls for a truce and dialogue were nothing but a way of playing for time to mobilise and arm militants from Maidan’. But opposition leaders called the violence ‘an act of provocation’ by the authorities.

This week’s clashes are the most deadly since protests began peacefully three months ago when Yanukovych abandoned closer ties with Europe in favour of Russia.

Ukraine is a nation of 46million, ethnically divided between Ukrainians who favour closer ties with Europe, and Russians who prefer links to Moscow.

The president opted to sign a deal with Russia, who offered a multibillion-pound bailout for Ukraine’s severe economic problems, rather than sign a trade deal with Europe.

Protesters are calling for the resignation of Yanukovych and early elections, but the embattled leader was fighting on last night despite signs that his empire was crumbling. Leading figures left his party and troops were reported to have supplied protesters with weapons, while senior party members said he had ‘completely lost control of the situation’.

European Union foreign ministers have agreed to impose sanctions on those ‘suspected of violence against anti-government protesters’. Mr Hague said yesterday: ‘Of course we call on all involved to turn away from violence, but some people are responsible for the violence and so we have decided to introduce targeted measures and targeted sanctions involving visa bans and asset freezes on those individuals who are responsible.’

Earlier the Ukrainian ambassador to London, Volodymyr Khandogiy, was summoned to the Foreign Office for the second time to be told that action to crush the protests was ‘unacceptable’.

The White House is also urging President Yanukovych to withdraw forces from downtown Kiev immediately. Spokesman Jay Carney called for dialogue to address the people’s grievances.

But Ukraine’s defence ministry said last night that the military may use weapons against citizens committing illegal acts in order to restore peace and stability.

At the Sochi Winter Olympics, Ukrainian skier Bogdana Matsotska said she would not take part in protest at the treatment of demonstrators.
