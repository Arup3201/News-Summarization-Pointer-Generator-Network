Mark Serwotka's blood is pumped around his body by a ventricular assist device

Union leader Mark Serwotka has told how he was left without a pulse after catching a rare virus while out walking his dog.

He suffered a mysterious heart failure four years ago, which eventually starved his internal organs of blood. It meant he had to be fitted with a £130,000 battery-powered device strapped to his waist which pumps blood around his body.

He is one of between only 140 and 150 people to have one of the gadgets, called a ventricular assist device (Vad). From the pump, a cable runs under his ribs, out of his stomach and into the controller in a bumbag.

The 51-year-old head of the Public and Commercial Services union, the biggest civil service union, said in an interview: ‘When I’m watching telly, I plug myself into the mains to charge the batteries. When I’m driving, I use the cigarette lighter.’

Vads have a tube that goes into the main artery, the aorta, and should not be switched off in case this triggers a clot. This means Mr Serwotka and other patients like him fitted with one cannot shower or take a bath. He also avoids taking public transport for fear of getting the cables snagged.

He believes he picked up the virus while taking his black labrador, Scampi, for a walk. The dog rolled in something disgusting and the next day ‘my face, my legs, everything had swollen’.

His GP initially gave him antihistamines which seemed to do the trick until a week later, when Mr Serwotka suddenly felt his heart ‘going crazy’.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors assumed he was having a heart attack as his heartbeat was 220 beats per minute, more than double what that of a normal, resting adult should be.

But MRI scans showed heavy scars suggesting the virus from the week before had attacked his internal organs, including his heart.

His heart muscle was too weak to pump blood around his body so he was fitted with a pacemaker which gives an electric shock if his heart starts beating irregularly, similar to the one fitted to Fabrice Muamba, the former Bolton Wanderers soccer star who collapsed on the pitch two years ago after suffering a cardiac arrest.

Mr Serwotka, who lives in Surrey with wife Ruth and their two children, returned to work but his condition worsened dramatically in summer 2013.

He told The Guardian: ‘I couldn’t walk 50 yards without being sick. I would retch 20 times a day.’

After being referred to specialist heart centre Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, he was told he needed a heart transplant - but any new organ would fail because his lungs were so ravenous for blood they were exerting huge pressure.

Mr Serwotka said: ‘If I didn’t get treatment. I’d have between one and three years. Probably nearer one.’

Doctors decided to fit the Vad, which they hope will ease the pressure from his lungs so he can eventually have a transplant. The device took a six-hour operation to fit involving cutting through his breastbone and bending his ribs.

Mr Serwotka, who is now back at home and preparing to return to work this month, said: ‘You can say, ‘S***, I wish I’d never taken the dog out that day.’ You can wonder, ‘Why me?’

‘But I’m one of those who thinks the glass is half-full, rather than half-empty - even when it’s only a quarter-full.’
