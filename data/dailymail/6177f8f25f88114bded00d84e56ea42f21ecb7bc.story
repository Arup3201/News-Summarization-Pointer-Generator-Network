An intruder high on bath salts was no match for a retired bull rider who was able to stop the man with a karate chop and a punch to the throat.

'The guy went down cold,' said Ervin Brittnacher, the 79-year-old who took down the intruder half his age.

Charles Smith, 38, was arrested after Brittnacher called the local League City police and charged him with burglary of a habitation with intent to commit assault since he had a gun.

Police determined that he was high on bath salts and he allegedly has a history of using the synthetic drug.

'During the time I was actually patting him down and checking his pockets he asked if that was his dad's eyeball in his pocket,' one of the responding officers said.

Mr Brittnacher awoke on Monday morning to the rousing bark of his dog around 5.45am when Smith broke down the screen door and entered the kitchen.

'I heard a ruckus at the door, walked to the door, and saw the young man holding a gun. I used to own a nightclub, and I knew it was never a good idea to talk to people holding guns,' he told ABC News.

Not only that, but Smith was muttering incoherently, hinting at the trouble that a later drug test would later reveal.

'I didn’t know whether to be scared or feel sorry for him,' Brittnacher told local station KENS5.

'I just took that old hand and give him a good old chop, and normally, that really hurts bad,' he said, describing his karate-style moves.

To make sure Smith was out, Mr Brittnacher followed that with a punch to the throat, which ended the fight.

Playing dirty is nothing new to Mr Brittnacher who gained fame at an early age as a bull rider and cowboy who steadied himself on bucking broncos and bulls.

Beyond that, he also worked as a bouncer at a honky tonk that he owned so Mr Brittnacher is used to breaking up fights, though that was some time ago.

'You can get run over real bad if you don't protect yourself,' he said.

Smith did not suffer and permanent damage, and that comes as a surprise to some who know Mr Brittnacher.

'I figured he would hurt him worse,' Mr Brittnacher's son Mark told KENS5.

'He’s not someone to mess with. Nicest man you’d ever want to meet. Do anything for you. But you don’t want to cross him, push him around. He ain’t going to put up with that.'
