Tony Blair is to face calls in Parliament to open up his finances to public scrutiny after earning millions from foreign states.

MPs are to demand an end to the earnings and business interests of former prime ministers remaining secret.

It follows growing questions about Mr Blair's work for controversial foreign governments and businesses including Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.

MPs are to demand an end to the earnings and business interests of former prime ministers like Tony Blair remaining secret

Mr Blair has denied being motivated by money and has dismissed reports he has amassed £100million since leaving office as 'greatly exaggerated'.

But because he is not an MP or a Lord his finances are not published or open to scrutiny.

A parliamentary motion will be tabled tomorrow by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen who accused Mr Blair of bringing the country into 'disrepute'.

In particular he argues it is wrong for a former British Prime Minister to be paid to advise another sovereign state.

Mr Bridgen says ex-PMs should be bound for life by the seven principles of public life, known as the Nolan principles, which include accountability and openness. He told MailOnline: 'I am proposing a change of the rules governing the conduct and accountability of former Prime Ministers and brinigng them under the Nolan prociples of public life.

'If Tony Blair had 10 per cent of the integrity that he claimed to have when in offie he would be spearheading this campaign and I wouldn't have to do any of this.

'I believe he has bought the office of Prime Minister into disrepute and is bringing the constitution and our country into disrepute.

'He is the only former Prime Minister to work for another sovereign government. I don't think that anyone who has held the highest office in our country and knows our secrets should work for another country.'

Mr Blair has faced criticism for agreeing a deal to advise the developers of a gas pipeline backed by the government of Azerbaijan, which has been accused of human rights abuses.

His clients have also included the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.

As a former Prime Minister, Mr Blair can claim up to £115,000 a year for his public duties.

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'It's up to parliamentarians to decide what they want to discuss.'

Mr Blair returned to Parliament last week to be grilled over his role in the controversial 'comfort letter's given to IRA suspects telling them they were not wanted in connections with the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

Mr Blair, who is the UN’s Middle East peace envoy, gave evidence to MPs about the ‘on the runs’ programme after evading an appearance for more than nine months. 

During a heated two-hour session, Mr Blair was told the ‘unsavoury’ scheme, drawn up following pressure from Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, had left victims feeling ‘hurt and betrayed’.

But the former PM said the letters were ‘absolutely critical’ to the peace process and an ‘essential component’ in getting Sinn Fein to accept an overhauled police service in Northern Ireland.

In July last year Mr Blair broke his silence about his wealth, to play it down. 

Responding to a question about his lucrative earnings, Mr Blair, who was marking the 20th anniversary of becoming Labour leader, joked that his wife Cherie kept demanding to know where his reported money is.

And he insisted that he is still motivated by the same ‘values’ as he was when he became Labour leader in 1997.

‘Today my work is global,’ he told an audience of admirers from the Blairite group Progress. ‘But what gets me up in the morning is the same.’

He added: ‘I haven’t changed, despite people wanting to say that I have changed. The same thing that motivated me when I stood here as Labour 20 years ago motivates me today – it’s not about making money, it’s about making a difference.’

Speaking about reports of his fortune, Mr Blair added: ‘In respect to my new life, first of all, I have to say that reports of my wealth are greatly exaggerated. Just for the record, I read I’m supposed to be worth £100million – Cherie’s kind of asking where it is. I’m not worth that, half of that, a third of that, a quarter of that, a fifth of that … I could go on.’
