Incredibly, this is the second world record Mr Hussain has broken - his first was for typing the English alphabet in just 3.43 seconds with his fingers.

Mr Hussain told wowzeto: 'After entering the Guinness World Records for the first time in 2012, I got a lot of inspiration from my family, from my parents, from my neighbors.

Mr Hussain said he typed with one eye closed, because 'it is difficult otherwise to locate the keys'

During the record-breaking attempt, he held his hands behind his back while frantically typing the sentence using just his nose. A large crowd gathered to watch as he broke the record.

Hinting at his tips on becoming a successful record holder, he said: 'If you want to set a record, every millisecond counts.

'This time I typed with one eye closed, as it is difficult otherwise to locate the keys.'
