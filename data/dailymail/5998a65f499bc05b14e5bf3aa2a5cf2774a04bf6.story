It was no doubt a weekend to remember as she and her husband-to-be George Clooney celebrated their upcoming nuptials with a group of close pals.

But on Tuesday it was back to reality for Amal Alamuddin, who was spotted arriving into Heathrow airport alone... although she still received the VIP treatment from airport staff.

The human rights lawyer, who was no doubt returning to work, was seen chatting away excitedly as she made her way through the airport in London… flashing her £450,000 seven-carat diamond engagement ring as she did so.

On show: The lawyer revealed her large engagement ring as she pushed her hair off her face

Proving once again that she is both brains and beauty, the 36-year-old looked cool in a pair of ripped, loose fitting jeans which featured a turn-up.

Making sure she was comfy for her flight the Brit wore a taupe coloured top with matching cardigan, while she added a cool twist with a pair of silver brogues.

Amal, who is trilingual, was perhaps calling her husband-to-be George to let him know that she had landed safely.

On Sunday the lawyer, who famously represented WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange, was seen heading to Café Habana, the restaurant owned by his business partner Rande Gerber, in Malibu, California, alongside the Hollywood heartthrob.

As well as celebrating his engagement, George was also celebrating his 53rd birthday - and shared a party with Bono, who turned 54 on May 10 as well as Bono's daughter Jordan, who shares her dad's birthday and turned 25, as well as Rande, who turned 52 on April 27.

A source told MailOnline: 'It was a real family affair, Rande and his wife Cindy Crawford had their kids Presley and Kaia there and everyone celebrated into the evening.

'There was karaoke and a Casamigos tequila bar set up outside and Bono and Jordan sang 'Something Stupid' while Cindy sang We Are Family. Bono's U2 bandmate The Edge even sang Wonderwall by Oasis.

Meanwhile The Daily Mirror reported that George 
sent a tongue-in-cheek message to the lawyer after meeting her at a 
charity event, where she refused to take his number.

According to the Mirror, Clooney reportedly wooed Amal by sending her an email joking that the 'reported hottest man in the world should meet with the hottest human rights lawyer in the world,' as Amal was once voted the ‘hottest barrister in London.’

Although she found the email amusing, she still made Clooney wait a few days for a reply, a friend told the paper.

And George’s tactic clearly worked as the famous bachelor  - who was married from 1989 to 1993 and later and despite a string of girlfriends, claimed he was not the marrying type  - decided to ask her to marry him.
