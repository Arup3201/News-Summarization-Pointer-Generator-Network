Edinburgh airport was reopening tonight after dozens of flights were cancelled because a suspicious package was found.

A passenger going through security was apparently found with traces of explosives on his bands and bag and an immediate investigation was launched.

The terminal building was evacuated and it is understood a male passenger was being questioned by police about the incident.

However, tonight police concluded there was no threat and efforts were being made to return the airport to normal.

Alert: Edinburgh airport was evacuated this afternoon after a suspicious package was found in the security area

A source told the Telegraph
 that the man was going through security when traces of explosives were 
found. The fire alarm was set off and around 300 passengers were 
evacuated.

A 100-metre cordon was put in 
place around the package although people who were already through 
security were allowed to remain inside.

Inbound planes were diverted to Glasgow as the incident was dealt with while outbound flights were cancelled.

Jamie
 Wale, 26, an electrician travelling with his wife and son, said: 'We 
were waiting at baggage reclaim after coming off our flight from 
Alicante with about 200 people when the fire alarm went off.

'The Tannoy started saying something like "Stay where you are, the building is being evacuated".

'It went off just after 2pm, and about 45 minutes later we were evacuated as we were told we were in a safe area.'

Mr
 Wale, from Harthill, North Lanarkshire, said: 'We were told nothing 
about what was actually happening but there was armed police at the 
front doors from what we could see.

Evacuation: Police said that a 'suspicious package' had been found and army bomb disposal experts have been called in

'There was loads of fire engines and ambulances in the parking lot and people had been evacuated into a nearby car park.

'From what I could see, there were three of four planes which still had passengers on them.'

Passenger
 Mac Nicoll tweeted: 'There was a suspect package in the X-Ray 
machine at about 1315 when I walked through security. It's cordoned off.

'We're inside now due to rain. In the eastern part of terminal. Fire alarm is still going. 2 planes landed, none taking off.'

Security alert: People are led away from the terminal building this afternoon by police after the suspicious package was found

Evacuation: Crowds gathered outside the airport after being told to leave the terminal building

Chief Inspector David Campbell from Police Scotland's Border Policing Command said: 'As part of a routine bag search at the airport, suspicions were raised about the contents of one item of hand luggage and the decision was taken to evacuate the airport while the appropriate enquiries could be carried out.

'We are now satisfied there isn't, nor was there ever, any risk to the public and the airport will now begin to reopen.

'We would like to thank the public for their patience and co-operation during the emergency service response.'

Gordon Dewar, chief executive of the airport, told Sky News that police found there was no threat and efforts were now being made to return the airport to normal.

Mr Dewar told Sky News: 'Round about two o'clock we had an unidentified threat that triggered an investigation in terms of being an issue of airport security.

Tonight police concluded there was no threat and efforts were being made to return the airport to normal

'Unfortunately that meant as part of 
that we had to evacuate the terminal building so it's effectively been 
closed since about 2.15pm and we've not been able to operate as normal, 
clearly in that time there has been a very extensive investigation with 
police and authorities and I'm delighted to say that they've now 
concluded that there is no threat, obviously it has taken some time to 
do that, so the challenge now will be once they have handed back the 
site to us that we get the airport back up to full operation.

'We'll
 do that relatively quickly but inevitably passengers and aircraft may 
not be where we need them and it will be a number of hours yet before we
 can get to some normality.

'We
 now this causes huge disruption and upset to people, we have done our 
best to mitigate that and make people as comfortable as possible in the 
circumstances but it's a cold wet day in Edinburgh, there's limited 
facilities when the terminal is shut and we just want to make sure 
people can now get away on their travels as best as possible.

'All
 we can do now is keep people informed, try to help the airlines get 
back to normality and get as many people away on their journey as 
possible.'
