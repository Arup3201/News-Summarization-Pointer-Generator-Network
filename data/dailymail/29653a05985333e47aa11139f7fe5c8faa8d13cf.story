The Duchess of Cambridge was all smiles as she met the families of brave men and women killed in Afghanistan following a commemoration service at St. Paul's Cathedral today.

Kate, who is eight months pregnant, also provoked a smile or two from those around her, when she appeared to grimace as her unborn child kicked her as she made her way out of the cathedral.

The 33-year-old was accompanied by the Queen and other senior members of the Royal Family for the ceremony at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, which was also attended by veterans and family members of the soldiers who died.

The Duchess of Cambridge is perenially perfect. By this point, Kate Middleton has totally mastered the art of looking put-together and ladylike (as if she had any other choice!).

There's a reason why her outfits are endlessly replicated everywhere. Of course, being royalty has something to do with it, but apart from that, Kate has majorly enviable style so its understandable why so many people want to get a piece of it to call their own. As every pregnant woman knows, it's next to impossible to look chic and structured as your belly comes in, but Middleton pulls it off with ease!

The Duchess of Cambridge's coat is amazingly still available over at Beulah London for close to one grand. But as we all know, once word gets out about where to buy this jacket, it's sure to sell out super fast, so buy it while you still can! If you don't have the budget of a to-be-Princess, one of our picks in the edit below should fit the bill!

Tribute: The Duchess, 33, was at St. Paul's with husband Prince William for a service commemorating the men who died in Afghanistan

Windy: She also had some trouble with her hat, thanks to the chilly March breeze that sprang up

As she made her way outside, the Duchess went over to speak to the families and exchanged smiles with some of the brave fighters before joining the crowds outside for a flypast.

She also spent some time chatting to a glamorously dressed Duchess of Cornwall, with the two apparently enjoying a friendly, if rather animated, conversation.

Earlier, Kate had appeared moved as she sat beside husband Prince William and his brother Prince Harry to hear the tributes paid to the 453 men and women who died while serving in Afghanistan.

The service was held to mark the end of combat operations in Afghanistan after 13 years, with the final British battalions pulled out and sent home last autumn.

Harry, who served two tours of duty in the country, looked particularly solemn as Prime Minister David Cameron spoke of the 'outstanding bravery' of the men and women who fought. 

'We take pride in the scale of their achievements, driving out Al Qaeda and building up the Afghan forces so they can begin to take control of their own security,' he continued 

Light relief: The moment was one of the more light-hearted of a morning that had focused heavily on the sacrifice of UK troops

Safely down: The Duchess of Cambridge walks down the steps of St. Paul's accompanied by Prince William and Prince Harry

Contemplation: The Duchess had looked enormously moved as tributes were paid to the men and women who died

Senior royals: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were part of a party of senior royals that also included the Queen and Prince Philip

Family affair: Also at the service were the Earl and Countess of Wessex and Prince Andrew, Duke of York

Cheerful: The Duchess looked happy and relaxed as she joined fellow royals and veterans for a flypast outside the cathedral

Paying attention: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stand to attention as the planes soar overhead

Warm: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chat to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall following the service

'Thirteen years on, the terrorist threat to our country from the region has been substantially reduced. Our families are safer because of what our Servicemen and women have done.'

But the British withdrawal came too late for some, among them Cpt Thomas Clarke, 30, Warrant Officer Spencer Faulkner, 38, and Cpl James Walters, 36, all of the Army Air Corps, who were among the last to perish in the conflict.

The service, which was led by the Prime Minister and the Queen, involved almost every senior member of the royal family, among them the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.

Also seated in Sir Christopher Wren's magnificent cathedral was Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and Prince Andrew, Duke of York.

The Princess Royal, who looked wonderful in her military uniform and cockade hat, was also at the service and, afterwards, travelled back to Gloucestershire for the final day of the Cheltenham Festival.

During the service, a cross made of shell casings from the memorial at the main allied base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion was brought through the cathedral by representatives of the three forces and presented at the altar.

Officer Cadet Noor Aziz, from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, read a recital before the Archbishop of Canterbury blessed the Camp Bastion cross for its new memorial at the Royal British Legion's National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

Logan's father Daniel Prior, 27, from Peacehaven, East Sussex, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment was killed during the conflict in March 2011

Animated: The Duchess enjoyed an animated conversation with her mother-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall

Close: The Duchess of Cambridge chatted to a clearly moved Prince Harry following the service

Kate smiles as she leaves St Paul's with William after the service 

Important work: Sophie Wessex stands with her husband Prince Edward and the Duke of York after the service

Touched: Prince Harry, who twice served in Afghanistan, looked particularly moved by the tributes he listened to

Sombre: The service was held to commemorate the 493 British men and women who were killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan

Prayers were read by Squadron leader Adam Booth, from the Permanent Joint Headquarters, Corporal Julian Cocks, from the Royal Marine Reserve, Bristol and Liuetenant Colonel Andrea Lewis, of the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps.

Sarah Bushbye, former Corporal of the Army Medical Services, Kerry Ashworth, mother of Lance Corporal James Ashworth of the Grenadier Guards who was killed, and Darren Fuller, former Colour Sergeant of the Parachute Regiment also said a prayer.

Afterwards, the congregation made its way outside to see five detachments made up of serving personnel from the Army, RAF, Royal Navy and the Royal Marines take part in a parade ahead of the flypast.

They marched in silence past St Paul's accompanied by military bands and pipes and drums, with Prince Charles taking the royal salute, through the centre of London to Guildhall.

Among those watching in silence was Kate, who will join the military for a second time in less than a week when on Tuesday, she and William pay their annual St. Patrick's Day visit to the Irish Guards. 

Ceremony: Also at the event was Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, both of whom looked very moved by proceedings

Family: Charles, who later took the royal salute during the parade, is flanked by Camilla, his sons and daughter-in-law

Solemn: The scene in a packed St. Paul's Cathedral earlier this morning

Warm welcome: Prince Harry gives his father a kiss as he arrives, while the Duke of Cambridge chats to the Duchess of Cornwall
