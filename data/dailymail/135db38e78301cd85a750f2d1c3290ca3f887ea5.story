In life Luca Giovannini was a  loving, lively and generous young boy who brought joy to everyone he met.

And after he died suddenly at the age of five he has continued to spread happiness.

For Luca has given the gift of life to four people after his organs were used in transplant operations.

Gift: Luca Giovannini died just 24 hours after complaining he felt unwell. When doctors told his parents he was not going to survive they decided to donate his organs

One of those Luca has saved is a 
two-year-old girl who was close to death and is now expected to be home 
with her parents in time for Christmas.

A two-year-old boy also benefited from a transplant, as did a 35-year-old mother of two and a man aged 34.

Luca died just over 24 hours after he 
was taken to hospital complaining of feeling sick. Doctors are yet to 
confirm the cause of his death but believe he may have had a rare 
reaction to the usually-treatable Epstein-Barr virus.

Many children become infected with the
virus but these infections usually cause no symptoms or are 
indistinguishable from other brief childhood illnesses.

But in rare cases it can cause complications such as swelling of the brain and heart and problems with the nervous system.

When doctors told Luca’s parents 
Vickie and Renzo that their son was not going to survive they made the 
decision that his death should not be in vain and that Luca would donate
some of his organs for transplant.

Mr Giovannini, a 38-year-old financial
adviser from Stockport, said: ‘When the medics were trying to save 
Luca’s life I asked a doctor what his chances were of surviving and he 
said we were looking at the worst-case scenario.

‘It’s a scenario which no parent wants to be faced with, but it was at that stage that we discussed organ donation.

‘We mentioned to the ward matron that 
we would like him considered for donation because we wanted something 
positive to come out of this.

‘We send Luca’s organs with love to 
all these people, especially to the little girl who they told us was 
just days away from dying.

‘She is now expected to leave hospital on Friday and be home in time for Christmas.

‘Luca did a lot of things in his short
life whereas these two children have never been out of hospital and now
hopefully they will get the chance to live similar lives.’ The little 
boy, who loved gymnastics, fell ill at 4am on November 14 and died at 
7am the next day.

Mr Giovannini said: ‘One week we were 
thinking about buying Luca his Christmas present and the next we were 
looking for a grave for him.

‘He was such a lively lad who never sat still and he had such a sunny disposition and was a very happy little boy.’

Luca was taken by ambulance from 
Wythenshawe Hospital to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital where 
doctors battled in vain to save his life.

Janet Ayling, his teacher at St Hugh’s
RC Primary in Timperley, said: ‘Somehow Luca’s love of life and his 
spirit will live on in all of us. ‘He will leave a legacy for all of us 
to follow – his beautiful smile, his gentle nature, and his whole happy 
being will never be forgotten.’

An inquest has been opened and adjourned. The funeral  of Luca, who also leaves a brother Leo, two, took place yesterday.

Because the death of a child is often not foreseen, many families do not consider the possibility of organ donation.

It is therefore not common for 
children to become organ donors to adults although the organs of 
children can be transplanted into adults successfully.

Last week two children killed in a shooting in North Carolina saved 12 lives between them by organ donation.

Hannaleigh Michelle Suttles, eight, and 14-year-old Zachary Lee Smith were gunned down by Mary Ann Holder, 36, in Greensboro.

One person can save up to eight lives 
with their transplantable organs, which include the heart, lungs, liver,
kidneys, pancreas and small intestine.

Tissue donations can benefit up to 50 people.
