George Groves is threatening to pull out of the biggest fight in this country’s boxing history if any British officials are appointed for his re-match with Carl Froch.

That ultimatum ignited the first war of words between these two sworn enemies, even as the first tranche of 60,000 Wembley tickets sold out within an hour of going online.

That verbal exchange was followed by a shoving match as the pair posed for photographs at the Stadium, with Froch pushing Groves in the chest.

And the fight is still two months away.

Froch took patriotic exception to Groves demanding that the referee and all three judges on May 31 are foreigners.

The financial stakes are astonishingly high.

What is now certain to become the first 80,000 boxing crowd on home soil will, alone, generate £6million.

Sky are projecting one million pay-per-view buys, potentially worth £17m.

Even if the TV audience falls short of that prediction, broadcasting rights in the US and another 100 countries world-wide will ensure that Froch-Groves II breaks the £20m barrier.

Then, as promoter Eddie Hearn was able to joke as 1,000 internet ticket sales per minute justified his gamble of committing to Wembley even though England play a pre-World Cup match at the Stadium the night before: ‘We also have the ice cream sales.’

Yet Groves insists he is prepared to 
walk away from his first seven-figure pay night - Froch as champion gets
 the lion’s share of at least £5m - if his demands are not met.

He says: ‘One British official, no ring walk. Unless the ref and the judges are from abroad the fight won’t happen.’

Groves
 has inserted a clause to that effect into his contract but Froch 
counters: ‘This is a huge British fight and it makes a mockery of our 
Board of Control to ask them to sanction the fight but not invite them 
to the party. It’s insulting.’

The
 first clash  ended in that controversy of a premature ninth round 
stoppage by top British referee Howard Foster in favour of Froch, even 
though Groves was ahead on the scorecards after inflicting a shock 
round-one knock down.

Groves argues now: ‘Given the long, 
heated build up for this second fight I want neutral officials who don’t
 live here so won’t be affected, either consciously or subconsciously, 
by all the hype on TV and in the press.’

Matchmaker: Promoter Eddie Hearn poses with both boxers

Says
 Froch: ‘George is just worried about a backlash from British judges 
after the way he has hung Howard Foster out to dry following the first 
fight. But it’s not right. I have complete respect for the British 
Boxing Board of Control and we have some of the finest, most 
knowledgeable referees and judges in the world. Although the stoppage 
was early Howard made an honest decision to protect George when I had 
him in trouble. In America, the referees tend to let fighters keep 
taking so much punishment that it becomes up to the corners to throw in 
the towel.’

The IBF, 
whose world super-middleweight title is the principle championship on 
the line, have been asked provisionally by the British Board to include 
at least one British judge.

At
 a meeting last week, Hearn asked if they would settle for the 
appointment of a British supervisor, probably Board general secretary 
Robert Smith who is on the roster of IBF officials.

Hearn
 adds: ‘It’s  situation we have to resolve in the coming weeks, as 
George does have this condition in his contract. But I can’t believe he 
would pull out of a fight of the magnitude even if the Board took 
absolute exception.’

Record breakers: Tickets for Froch-Groves II sold out in an hour

Not playing the game: Froch refuses to look Groves in the eye after their press conference

Froch doubts it, too. Although Groves 
may be less willing to compromise after Froch levered him away with two 
hands to the chest at this, their first head-to-head meeting since their
 November collision in November – after Carl’s brother Lee loudly 
challenged him to an impromptu scrap.

The latter incident took place during the media launch of the event, at Wembley, and of itself was laughed off by Groves.

The
 confrontation between the two boxers themselves came after Froch had 
refused to engage with Groves in the traditional stare-down for 
publicity pictures and then declined the proffered handshake, although 
he did say: ‘Thank you, George.’

Both men had presented themselves initially as more calm, composed and respectful than in the build-up to their first fight.

Then
 came the difference of opinion about the officials, as well as barbs 
about Groves having played with a Rubik cube while Froch was addressing 
the TV cameras.

Groves jibed: ‘Carl is such a simple puzzle to solve. I wanted a harder one.’

Froch reacted: ‘I bet he didn’t work it out. He’s thick. In one email he spelled pretence as pretense.’

Know your enemy: Groves talks to one of Froch's entourage

Each denied hating the other, although the animosity clearly lingers on. Groves said he would not want to spend time in
 room with his rival unless he had to. Froch waved hand under his 
challenger’s nose by way of repeating his familiar claim that Groves has
 bad breath.

So while the physical brush was more handbags than harmful, it was not a publicity stunt.Not that this event needs one.

As
 those 60,000 tickets flew out over the ether, Hearn was seeking talks 
with the London Transport Authority to gain their approval for the sale 
of another 20,000 seats.

He
 may have to agree to bring the timing of the first bell forward, to the
 irritation of some overseas broadcasters, in the interests of safety as
 the crowd go home at night.

If
 so, it would be a small price to pay for breaking the live gate record 
of 70,000 set by Jack Peterson and Jack Doyle back in the mists of time.

The
 highest attendances claimed by Wembley are some 50,000 each for Henry 
Cooper versus Cassius Clay and Frank Bruno versus Tim Witherspoon.

The
 biggest turn out hitherto this century is 56,000 for Ricky Hatton’s 
fight with Juan Lazcano at his beloved Manchester City’s ground in 2008 –
 and that record has gone already.

Fingers crossed: Groves is hoping for a different outcome in the re-match

All smiles: Froch looks relaxed at the press conference

On one point the two boxers did agree. Both are hugely excited by being at the centre of such a momentous occasion.

Groves said: ‘Everything happens for a reason, even that stonewall robbery in Manchester which has made this happen. I’m doubly thrilled because its in my home city. That’s  one round to me.’

Froch said: ‘This is the national stadium, not anyone’s local football ground. I feel humbled to be part of this. I’m going to enjoy this, and so should everyone else.’

Of course, each thinks he will win.

Groves said: ‘Carl has been forced into taking a fight he didn’t want and after how badly I hurt him first time he knows he can’t win. If I decide to go for him early this will be like the old Leonard-Hearns classic, all over in three fantastic rounds.’

Froch said: ‘I had a bad night at the office in Manchester while George was the best he can ever be – but I still won. There will be no arguments after I knock him out here.’

The hype goes on.
