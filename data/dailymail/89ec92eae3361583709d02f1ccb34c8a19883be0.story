Some older women with breast cancer could safely avoid radiotherapy without harming their chances of survival, say researchers.

Older patients who are given breast-conserving surgery and hormone therapy gain very ‘modest’ benefit from radiation treatment, they found.

The findings suggest that carefully selected patients who are at low risk of recurrence could avoid the health risks and side effects associated with radiotherapy, such as fatigue and heart damage.

Some older women with breast cancer could safely avoid radiotherapy without harming their chances of survival, say researchers

Currently older women with early-stage hormone-sensitive breast cancer are offered surgery to remove their tumour, followed by hormone treatment and radiotherapy.

Conventional external beam radiotherapy, which irradiates the whole breast, involves many hospital visits, often spread over several weeks to reduce side effects, such as tissue shrinkage.

Few trials have assessed the benefits of radiotherapy in older women treated using breast-conserving surgery, where the lump is removed not the whole breast.

Scientists at the University of Edinburgh led an international trial involving 1,326 patients aged 65 or older with early-stage hormone-sensitive cancer, the most common form of breast cancer.

Their tumours were surgically removed and had not spread to the lymph nodes underneath the arm, says a report in the journal Lancet Oncology.

Half of the women were given radiation as well as hormone treatment and half were given hormone treatment alone.

After five years, roughly 96 per cent of both groups had survived, and most deaths were not caused by breast cancer.

Katherine Woods, of the charity Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘These results are very interesting'

Around 1.3 per cent of those given radiation had cancer recur in the treated breast compared with 4.1 per cent of those who did not receive radiotherapy.

Pregnant women are more than twice as likely to quit smoking if they are offered shopping vouchers as part of a treatment plan, according to a study.

Researchers from Glasgow and Stirling universities divided 612 pregnant smokers into two groups. Half were offered only advice and nicotine replacement therapy to help them stop smoking.

Half were offered up to £400 worth of vouchers to be used at stores including Argos, Boots and Toys R Us if they had the advice and treatment and quit while pregnant.

According to a report in the BMJ, 69 women quit from the group offered shopping vouchers, and 26 from the other group – 23 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. The results were confirmed by urine and saliva testing.

After 12 months, 15 per cent of women who were offered financial incentives remained off cigarettes compared with4 per cent in the other group.

The report says that widening the incentive scheme could produce public health benefits ‘as important as vaccines’. But critics are likely to claim ‘bribery’ is being used to get mothers to maximise the health of their children.

In the UK around 5,000 babies a year die in the womb or shortly after birth from mothers smoking in pregnancy.

Professor Ian Kunkler, of the University of Edinburgh’s Cancer Research Centre, said: ‘While radiotherapy will remain the standard of care for most women after breast-conserving surgery, the absolute reduction in risk of recurrence from radiotherapy in low-risk older women receiving hormone treatment is very modest. This makes omission of radiotherapy an option for selected older patients.’

In the UK, around 50,000 women develop breast cancer each year – four out of five in the postmenopausal years after the age of 50 – and almost 12,000 women die each year. Radiotherapy is offered to all women who have breast conserving surgery – around 35,000 a year.

The Edinburgh researchers stressed that the results were only applicable to patients aged 65 or older with grade 1 and 2, node-negative tumours up to 3cm in size.

Dr Emma Pennery, clinical director at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘We know that some older women find the prospect of radiotherapy such a burden that they opt to have a mastectomy to avoid it, so this research will be hugely welcomed by many patients.

‘Radiotherapy can cause side effects such as pain and fatigue, which can be very daunting.

‘However, this study is on a group of patients with a particular kind of breast cancer. Findings also show rates of local recurrence were nearly 3 per cent higher in women who didn’t have radiotherapy treatment.

‘Radiotherapy is still a highly effective treatment for many women with breast cancer.’

Katherine Woods, of the charity Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘These results are very interesting. However, with only five years’ follow up the results do need to be approached cautiously.’
