Voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the recreational use of marijuana Tuesday night, and before anti-drug advocates had time to complain, the movement already gained a celebrity endorsement.

Actor Seth Rogen posted an enthusiastic message to Twitter shortly after the law was announced: 'I'm moving to Colorado.'

Rogen's positivity about the law, which places the drug nearly on par with alcohol and cigarettes, comes as little surprise as he has been outspoken about his drug use.

Fan from out of state: Rogen currently lives in California

The actor has starred in a number of stoner comedies, most notably Pineapple Express and Knocked Up.

'It's funny because I'm from Vancouver where its just much more culturally accepted, even coming to America it was shocking to me and after getting detained by the police a couple times I realized how much more seriously it's viewed,' he said in a previous interview.

The change in legislation shows that Rogen's lax attitude towards the drug is being upheld in at least two states in the U.S. now, as residents of both Colorado and Washington will soon be able to walk into dispensaries and purchase up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use -- no prescription required. Users only have to prove they are at least 21.

Fifteen other states and the District of Columbia have approved marijuana for medical use, but it requires a doctor's prescription and certification that it will be used to treat a chronic health condition.

The ballot measures in the two western states defy the federal government, which still views marijuana as a controlled substance. It is unknown how the Obama Administration will handle the state laws -- which are still superseded by the federal prohibition.

Celebration: Supporters of Amendment 64, which legalizes marijuana use in Colorado, celebrated their victory last nigth

The Justice Department could potentially sue the states and block the laws entirely.

Federal officials have stayed silent on the issue during the election, though they have taken only small steps to crack down on state-sanctioned dispensaries and growers in places like California

'Federal law still
 says marijuana is an illegal drug, so don't break out the Cheetos or 
gold fish too quickly,' Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper, a 
Democrat who opposed legalization, warned supporters celebrating their victory.

Passed: Three states had the legalization of recreational marijuana on their ballots, measures that would set up a direct challenge to federal drug law

Opponents say legalizing marijuana will result in more abuse of the drug by children, as well as increased numbers of impaired who get behind the wheel under the influence.

In Washington, Initiative 502 passed by a massive 10-pount margin, 55 percent to 45 percent. It allows adults over age 21 to buy up to an ounce of marijuana from heavily-taxed state-run drug dispensaries.

Supporters poured money into the campaign, raising more than $6million, some which is spent on TV ads.

Colorado's Amendment 64 passed 53 to 47 percent. Colorado residents over age 21 will be able to purchase up an one ounce of the drug from heavily-regulated, privately-run retail stores. It's also legal to grow up to six marijuana plants.

Voters in Oregon rejected a marijuana-legalization bill that was even more liberal than those proposed in Washington and Colorado. It trailed by 10 percentage points and was roundly rejected in most counties last night.

Massachusetts voters approved the medical use of marijuana last night, though voters in Arkansas rejected a similar measure.

'Today the state of Washington looked at
 70 years of marijuana prohibition and said it's time for a new 
approach,' said Alison Holcomb, manager of the campaign that won passage
 of Initiative 502 in Washington.

Since California first legalized medical marijuana use in 1996, states across the country have begun to follow suit.

The votes last night make Washington and Colorado the only states to legalize use of the drug without a prescription.

Here is a list of places that currently allow medical marijuana use, an the year the laws were enacted.

The marijuana measures in Colorado 
and Washington will likely pose a headache for the U.S. Justice 
Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which consider pot 
an illegal drug.

The DOJ has declined to say how it would respond if the measures were approved.

Colorado's Amendment 64 will allow 
adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce of marijuana, though using the 
drug publicly would be banned. The amendment would allow people to grow 
up to six marijuana plants in a private, secure area.

Washington's measure establishes a 
system of state-licensed marijuana growers, processors and stores, where
 adults can buy up to an ounce. It also establishes a standard blood 
test limit for driving under the influence.

The Washington measure was notable 
for its sponsors and supporters, who ranged from public health experts 
and wealthy high-tech executives to two former top Justice Department's 
officials in Seattle, U.S. Attorneys John McKay and Kate Pflaumer.

'Marijuana policy reform remains an 
issue where the people lead and the politicians follow,' said Ethan 
Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance, which opposes the co-called 'war 
on drugs.' 'But Washington state shows that many politicians are 
beginning to catch up.'

Estimates show pot taxes could bring 
in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but the sales won't start 
until state officials make rules to govern the legal marijuana industry.

The Washington measure was opposed by
 Derek Franklin, president of the Washington Association for Substance 
Abuse and Violence Prevention.

'Legalizing is going to increase 
marijuana use among kids and really create a mess with the federal 
government,' Franklin said. 'It's a bit of a tragedy for the state.'

Historic: Colorado and Washington are blazing trails for greater acceptance of the drug -- though the federal government say marijuana is a controlled substance

The marijuana referendums in Colorado and Washington make the drug legal to possess -- but also heavily regulate its sale.

Here are a few details about the laws.
