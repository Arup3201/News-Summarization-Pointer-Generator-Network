An 82-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences as part of the Jimmy Savile investigation.

The pensioner is one of 11 people arrested so far under Operation Yewtree – the Met’s investigation into alleged offending by the former disc jockey and others.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said last night that the man, who has not been named, was interviewed under caution on November 29 last year, five days after a search warrant was executed at an address in Berkshire.

He has been given police bail until May. Earlier this week the Mail revealed that as few as three of the men arrested by Scotland Yard over suspected sex offences in the Savile case are likely to be charged.

Details of the small number of Yewtree prosecutions emerged a day after a former BBC producer was released without charge following his arrest over an alleged sex assault in 1965.

Wilfred De’ath, 75, who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused police of being ‘over-zealous’ because they had failed ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign of terror while he was still alive.

Amid claims of a celebrity witch-hunt, there has been growing speculation that Freddie Starr could soon be told that he, too, will not be charged.

Yewtree: 70-year-old entertainer Freddie Starr was arrested in November but there is speculation he will be cleared

The 70-year-old entertainer was arrested in November over claims he attempted to grope a 14-year-old girl in Jimmy Savile’s BBC changing room in 1974.

A woman called Karin Ward claimed Starr had had a ‘very bad attack of wandering hands’ with her nearly 40 year ago. He vehemently denied her claims.

Last month a Metropolitan Police report said Savile had abused adults and children across the country over more than five decades.

The NSPCC said Savile, who was 84 when he died, had been one of the most prolific sex offenders in its 129-year history.
