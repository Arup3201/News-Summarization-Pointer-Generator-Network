These three young with the infamous Reverend Bob Larson are the teenage exorcists who claim they can rid you of your demons - and they did just that to a woman named Cynthia.

Rev Larson and his assistants, daughter Brynne, 18, and her two friends, sisters Tess, 17, and Savannah Scherkenback, 20, collectively banish peoples tortured souls.

Cynthia believed a Chinese demon named 'Jezebel' was haunting her before the girls' exorcism in Arizona.

The trio met in karate class where they all excelled in self-defence, training to black belt standard.

But since then the girls, who also enjoy horseback riding and shopping, have exercised demons in over one hundred rituals since training at Larson's School of Exorcism.Â 

Larson said: 'I train the girls how to spot the difference between mental illness and possession.

'They learn some of the basic factors. If someone has been diagnosed with a mental illness we don't do an exorcism.

'Based on my experience, probably half 
the population of America is possessed. Also, based on things like rates
of abuse, drugs, and anti-social behaviour.

'We are a very desperate, morally bankrupt culture and that's where demons operate.'

Cynthia, who did not wish to provide her surname, was undergoing her third exorcism in Scottsdale. She believes 'Jezebel,' among other demons, was inside her tortured soul.

The girls set to work in a conference room, calling out the demon alongside Reverend Larson. They chanted for it to 'go to the pit of hell' and with one final call Cynthia vomited into a bucket.

Amazingly, at the end of it all, Cynthia requested one more thing - to marry her partner Ricky there and then.

After she retreated quickly to change into her white dress, Rev Larson - a veteran of some 15,000 exorcisms around the world - happily fulfilled the unusual request.

Brynne said: 'We worked with her (Cynthia) and got her demons drawn out and now she's all cleaned up.

'She's a great example of what can be done with deliverance. The exorcism with Cynthia was one of the most incredible that we had done in a long time. It was very dramatic and violent. But we had it under control. It was spectacular.'

'It was very intense,' added Savannah. 'The demon was very stubborn. We had to keep going. It was a battle. Then we ended with a wedding. That was a memorable night! It had such a beautiful ending.'

Larson was very happy with how it all turned out, and with the girls' performance.

'They did an excellent job,' he says. 'They handled it with dignity and boldness, even though this was very violent. There were times where I had to step in, but they were doing things that very few priests would do.

'They are very brave girls. They got up close with the demon. This is very unusual for teenage girls to do something like this.'

He added: 'I believe the girls' work in exorcism has prevented many people from entering into a destructive life and they should be seen as a great asset to society.'
