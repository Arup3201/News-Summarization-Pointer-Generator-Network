When Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note Edge in September, the South Korean firm said it would be available 'in the fall', but no exact date wasn't given. 

The latest filings from the Federal Communications Commission, however, now suggest the handset is imminent.

The FCC has officially tested and approved the sale of the curved phablet on certain LTE, also known as 4G, frequencies, and this is typically one of the final steps before a wide release.

When Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note Edge, the firm said it would be available 'in the fall', but an exact date wasn't given. Filings from the Federal Communications Commission (pictured) have now approved the phone to go on sale in the US, suggesting the handset is imminent

The files were originally spotted by the GforGames blog. 

It said the handset is likely to be available to T-Mobile and AT&T customers in the US first, because the files lists frequency bands used by the two network operators.

Prices for the device are yet to be announced.

Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device.

Processor: 2.7 GHz Quad-Core

Display: 5.6 inches (141.9mm) Quad HD+ Suiper AMOLED (2560 x 1440)

Operating System: Android 4.4 (KitKat)

Rear camera: 16 MP Auto Focus camera

Front camera: 3.7MP

Memory: 32/64 GB internal and microSD slot (up to 64 GB)

RAM: 3GB

Dimensions: 5.9 inches x 3.2 inches x 0.3 inches (151.3 x 82.4 x 8.3 mm)

Weight: 174g

The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it.

The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts.

The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example.

Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages.

The Note Edge was announced alongside the new Galaxy Note 4 phone, which lacks the side screen, and a virtual-reality headset called Gear VR.

The Galaxy Note 4 is available in the US and the UK on pay-monthly contracts starting from $30 in the US and £45 in the UK. 

The latest version of the large smartphone has an improved interface, including a new Multiwindow feature that enables users to minimise and resize different screens on their phone for multi-tasking in much the same way you would on a desktop computer.  

The Edge uses Samsung's flexible-display technology, which came out to much fanfare last year, but has seen little use beyond a phone and a fitness device with displays that were slightly curved.

With the Edge, Samsung is offering a practical use for the curvature. While the main screen remains flat like previous phones, the right edge extends and curves until it reaches the back.

The files also suggest the phone is likely to be available to T-Mobile and AT&T customers in the US first, because it lists frequency bands used by the two network operators. South Korean-based Samsung unveiled the curved 'phablet' in September to the surprise of many in the audience

The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge features a 16MP rear-facing camera (left) and a 3.7MP front camera (right). The tech giant also announced the Galaxy Note 4 and the Gear VR headset developed in tandem with Facebook-owned virtual reality company Oculus

That creates a side display so information such as weather and time can be seen from the side when the phone is laid on a table or nightstand.

With the side display, the phone's camera functions more like a stand-alone, point-and-shoot camera, as the shutter button and other functions appear on top when the phone is held horizontally.

The side display of the Edge also provides one-tap access to various apps normally found on the home screen. 

It will also have a panel of tools, like the flashlight and stopwatch, akin to what Apple offers in the iPhone's Control Center with a swipe up from the bottom. 

Samsung will look to app developers to find new ways to use the feature.
