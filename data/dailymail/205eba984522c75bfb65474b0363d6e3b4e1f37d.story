They were once confined to the burly arms of sailors and criminals.

But now it seems tattoos have an altogether more middle-class fan base, according to new research.

More than a quarter of this social class have ventured into the world of body art, with 28 per cent admitting to having at least one tattoo.

The study showed professionals are now marginally more likely to be tattooed than their working class counter parts – of which only 27 per cent have undergone the needle.

It is a trend that has even become well established in the ‘AB’ upper class, with 19 per cent adorned with body art.

Aman Malhotra, research assistant at Harris Interactive, which conducted the study, said that the tattoo was no longer the preserve of the working classes.

He said: ‘The tattoo appears to have transcended traditional class boundaries.’

The study, which looked at more than 2,000 people across the country and from different demographics, found that 6 per cent of the middle classes had between three and five pieces of body art and 17 per cent had between six and ten. Only 1 per cent had more than ten.

But according to tattoo parlours, these new customers are adopting a wholly more conservative slant on the ancient craft.

Middle-class women are most likely to opt for something small, discreet and feminine, while middle class men are choosing designs which are easy to hide under work clothes.

Mo Coppoletta, 43, the founder of The Family Business tattoo parlour in Clerkenwell, north London, said that their approach to body art was still ‘conservative’.

He told The Sunday Times: ‘Middle class women will go for something very decorative, with lots of embellishment and adornment, while men go for letters and scripts.

‘Women are always looking for something softer and feminine. They chose more intimate places for their tattoos — it is more for themselves than to show off.

‘They tend to be on the ankle, the foot, the lower back or the shoulder blade. Never prominent.

‘Middle-class men tend to go for letters and scripts. Koi fish tattoos are popular. Men tend to get tattoos on their backs, legs and under-arms. They don't tend to go really big.’

He said that after working in the tattoo industry for 18 years, he has seen a marked change in his customers in the last decade.

‘Tattoos are more accepted and more of a fashion accessory these days, so it has become more normal and therefore more attractive to all sorts of classes,’ he said.

‘Coming through the door now is mainly professionals, aged between late 20s and 40s. They are the main core of our establishment.’

The transition among the classes has been felt throughout the industry, with many parlours adopting classier looking décor to attract moneyed customers.

Fortunately most women don't go as far as having a tattoo  'sleeve' covering their whole arm

Roland Hyams, publicist for the international London Tattoo Convention, has seen a dramatic growth in popularity since the event began in 2005.

He said: ‘It's definitely sporting the middle classes, without a doubt. I think it is particularly because of celebrities and because tattoos have become more mainstream.’

When the convention first began, it had 3,500 visitors, now it has more than 20,000.

Dr Gemma Angel, a tattoo historian and professor at University College London, added: ‘The visibility of tattoos does make it more acceptable as time goes on. Once something becomes ubiquitous and I think tattoos are now, they are not such a taboo.’
