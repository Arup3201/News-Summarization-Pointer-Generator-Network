While his Italian team-mates are away vying for Euro 2016 qualification, Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is reminiscing on a past tournament... by recreating his famous goal celebration from 2012.

The out-of-sorts striker, who was left out of Antonio Conte's squad for Italy's qualifier against Bulgaria and a friendly with England, posted the picture to Instagram on Tuesday afternoon.

In 2012, after scoring for the Azzurri against Germany in a European Championship semi-final, Balotelli whipped off his shirt, before striking a pose to show off his muscular frame.

Perhaps serving as a reminder of what he can do, Balotelli recreated the celebration for Instagram, alongside the message, 'Old euro cup pose LOADING....'

In the most recent picture, Balotelli appears to be sporting a new tattoo on his pectoral, as well as a far less zany hairstyle.

The Reds forward has struggled for goals of late, only netting four in 25 matches this season. He did, though, get on the scoresheet for Jamie Carragher's XI in last weekend's Liverpool All-Star game.

He'll be hoping he can take that form into the Premier League, starting with Arsenal next Saturday.
