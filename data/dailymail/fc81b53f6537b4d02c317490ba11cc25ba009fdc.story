The Ronnie Corbett sitcom 'Sorry' that poked fun  at a middle-aged man living with their parents would be a 'documentary' today, Michael Gove claimed tonight.

The Government chief whip said  it was too hard for people to get on the housing ladder today, forcing people to stay at home later in life.

He said new plans to build 200,000 cheap 'starter homes' for the under 40s were needed to help a generation buy their first home.

Michael Gove said the Ronnie Corbett sitcom 'Sorry' would be a 'documentary' today because of the cost of buying a first home

Mr Gove's remarks, to LBC's Iain Dale, came after it emerged more than 30,000 people have registered for the new 'starter homes' schemes within 48 hours of its launch.

David Cameron yesterday announced that under a future Tory Government 200,000 new homes will be sold 20 per cent cheaper than the going rate - but only for those under 40 who haven't yet bought their own home.

Mr Cameron said building cheap new homes for first time buyers would be the centre-piece of the Tory Party's house-building strategy after the election.

Mr Gove tonight said the proposal was necessary to help young families get a leg onto the housing ladder.

He said: ‘What David has been talking about is extending the number of what have been called ‘starter homes’. These are homes that we will make available to people under the age of 40 so they can get onto the housing ladder.

‘The right thing to do is to help those people who, traditionally, would have been able to expect to get a home before they are 40.

‘I remember when we were growing up, there was a situation comedy called “Sorry” with Ronnie Corbett.

‘It was a comedy because you had a man in his 40s living with his parents. Well, it was a comedy then – it is a documentary now. We need to make sure we have more homes for young people.’

In the sitcom 'Sorry' Ronnie Corbett plays Timothy Lumsden, who still lives at home with his parents despite being middle aged

The Prime Minister yesterday promised the new homes for under 40s would be 'decent, well-built, homes – places to start and raise a family'.

Mr Cameron also promised to keep mortgage rates low, build more homes, extend the controversial help-to-buy scheme and encourage more people to buy their own council house.

Local councils will also be given more power to stop unpopular developments, Mr Cameron said.

The PM said: 'There is a particular kind of security that comes with owning your own home [but] too many people have been denied that security.

'The young people in their 20s and 30s still living with their parents, desperately saving for their own place.

'The couple who want a child but can't afford to upsize – even though they both have full-on, full-time jobs. It shouldn't be this way.

'Our goal is a Britain where everyone who works hard can have a home of their own.'
