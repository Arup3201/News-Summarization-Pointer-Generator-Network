A veteran of Mitt Romeny's failed presidential campaign unveiled a new slogan this weak meant to humanize the GOP's image, but older Republicans may experience a shudder of wary recognition upon hearing it.

'Republicans Are People, Too,' reads the new promotional material including a video, Web site, and social media campaign, launched by Republican Vinny Minchillo, and repeating the same slogan meant to make the brand more friendly in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal.Â 

Minchillo decided to revive the slogan because he believes that it has become 'socially acceptable to say bad things about Republicans' and that it's time to 'let people know that it's OK to be a Republican.'

A new campaign slogan meant to humanize GOP members has a sad history in the party after the Watergate scandal

'People, I'm afraid, think that Republicans spend their days huddling over a boiling cauldron throwing in locks of Ronald Reagan's hair,' he told The New Republic. 'We thought let's get out there and show who Republicans really are: 'regular folks interested in making the world a better place.'

He added that, like the Republicans in his campaign videos, he himself shops at Trader Joe's and reads the New York Times.

An executive at Glass Housing Strategies consulting firm, he says he came up with the idea on his own seeing Republicans lambasted on the internet.

Republican Vinny Minchillo came up with the slogan without knowing its history, saying he was inspired by seeing Republicans treated badly online

'A big part of the idea is from my life experience as a Republican online,' he said. 'I've been called a lot of really bad things. It seems like it has become socially acceptable to say bad things about Republicans.'

However speaking to Yahoo, Ronald Reagan biographer and political consultant Craig Shirley said the slogan was originally received as 'the wail of pathetic losers.'

He had already addressed the campaign's failure in his book Reagan's Revolution, comparing the 1974 GOP to a 'stray cat' people would like to 'immediately' euthanize.

He further mocked the campaign material for the then 'party of losers' writing: 'As if to remove all doubt about the Republican's insecurities and cowardice, the buttons were manufactured in bright yellow.'

The Republican National Committee spokesmen contacted by reporters about the slogan did not respond to interview requests.

Minchillo said he had no idea his campaign slogan was a repeat of the infamous tagline.

'That's a little before my time,' he told Yahoo. 'I'll have to go back and take a look at it. That's really funny. Those were some pretty dark times for Republicans for sure.'

He says he still has faith in the slogan despite its checkered history, and thinks the video could help with voter registration.

'I've heard from a lot of campaigns who say it's a breath of fresh air, especially this time of year. If you're in a competitive state it's just one negative ad after another,' he said.
