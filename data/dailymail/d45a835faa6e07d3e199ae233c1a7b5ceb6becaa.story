Tens of thousands of Americans whose computers are infected with malware will lose Internet service on Monday - but the meltdown is preventable by following a few simple steps.

The impending crash will affect those whose computers have been infected with the nasty 'Alureon/DNS Changer bot' when the FBI takes down the servers at 12.01 a.m. on Monday, July 9.

To avoid the meltdown, users need to determine if their computer is infected with DNS Changer. Antivirus software will not have offered protection, and Mac computers are also at risk.

Internet shutdown: Software called Alureon/DNS Changer attempts to change the website you visit - and those infected may get cut off on Monday

To check, users can visit www.dns-ok.us. If you see a red background, your machine has been 
infected, and while green signals good news, you could still be at risk.

You can also go to www.dcwg.org, run by the DNS Changer Working Group, a
collection of experts the FBI recruited to help with the problem.

The site includes links to 
commercial sites that will run a quick check on the computer, and it 
also lays out detailed instructions if users want to actually check the 
computer themselves.

Once there, click on 'Detect' and 
scroll to 'Manually Checking if your DNS server have been Changed'. 
Click on the option for your system and follow the step-by-step guide.

If you are worried about the impending meltdown, follow these steps:

1) Visit this FBI-approved site - http://www.dns-ok.us - and see if you get an 'all-clear' green background or an 'at risk' red background.

2) If you have a red background, visitÂ http://www.dcwg.org/fix which lists free virus scanner and removal software.

Our personal recommendations from the free range are Microsoft Windows Defender and Avira.

For more information, visit here: http://www.dcwg.org/detect/

Your Internet service provider might also be able to help if you think your computer could have been affected.

Scroll to the bottom of www.dcwg.org/detect to see a list of the pages set up by providers for users.

If you discover that your computer 
has been infected, you can follow the steps at www.dcwg.org/fix. It is 
recommended to back up your files.

The
cause of the crash is a piece of software, which was designed to redirect you from trusted websites to other sites in a bid to steal personal information and which found its way onto hundreds of thousands of computers
last year.

When
the attack was noticed, the FBI took the unusual step of setting up a 
'safety-net', routing infected machines through their server to stop the
'spoof' attacks.

These
servers will be taken down on 12.01 a.m. on Monday, July 9, and when this happens, people 
still infected are likely to lose their internet connection without 
warning.

The warnings about the problem have 
been splashed across Facebook and Google. Internet service providers 
have sent notices, and the FBI has set up its special website.

If you wish to check if your computer is at risk, visit http://www.dns-ok.us (linked above) and hopefully you will see the 'all clear' sign

Despite
repeated alerts, the number of computers that probably are infected is 
more than 277,000 worldwide, down from about 360,000 in April.

Of those still infected, the FBI believes that about 64,000 are in the United States.

Users whose computers are still 
infected on Monday will lose their ability to go online, and they will 
have to call their service providers for help deleting the malware and 
reconnecting to the Internet.

According to Tom Grasso, an FBI 
supervisory special agent, many Internet providers are ready for the 
problem and have plans to try to help their customers.

Grasso
said other Internet providers may come up with technical solutions that
they will put in place on Monday that will either correct the problem 
or provide information to customers.

If the Internet providers correct the 
server problem, the Internet will work, but the malware will remain on 
victims' computers and could pose future problems.

In addition to individual computer owners, about 50 Fortune 500 companies are still infected, Grasso said.
