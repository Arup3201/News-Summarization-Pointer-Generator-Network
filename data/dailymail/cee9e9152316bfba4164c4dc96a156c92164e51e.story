A Tory MP has landed an £800-an-hour job at the same firm he had lavished praise on while working a transport minister, according to a Labour MP.

Stephen Hammond took the role with Inmarsat, which makes communications systems for aviation and shipping, just months after he was sacked as Secretary of State for Transport.

Former City banker Hammond had said he was 'hugely impressed' by the company during his two years as a minister- where he attended official events alongside Inmarsat bosses.

Labour MP Karl Turner told the Daily Mirror that the situation was 'grubby' and accused Mr Hammond of 'feathering his nest' with the staggering fees.

'This is a perfect example of why the rules around MPs' second jobs need to change,' he added.

But Mr Hammond, who lost his position as transport secretary in the reshuffle, said he had done everything 'by the book' in regards to his new position which had been approved by the Commons authorities and the Department for Transport.

The Commons register of members' interests states that Mr Hammond has been paid £20,000 for just 25 hours' work advising Inmarsat plc with his contract due to run out at the end of March.

The MP for Wimbledon in south west London, had said he was impressed by Inmarsat on a visit to the company's headquarters in 2013.

He later gave a speech at an Inmarsat dinner where he said he was 'committed' to a government partnership with the firm.

Labour leader Ed Miliband had called for a ban on MPs having lucrative second jobs to 'restore the reputation' of the Commons in the wake of the cash for access scandal.

It came after revelations of former foreign secretaries Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Jack Straw being filmed by undercover reporters boasting about how they could be hired for £5,000-a-day.

Sir Malcolm announced he was suspended from the Tory party and forced quit as an MP after bragging that he could see any foreign ambassador in London and has 'useful access' to every British ambassador in the world.

Mr Straw was suspended by the Labour party after being filmed boasting about having laws changed 'under the radar'.

Commons Speaker John Bercow had warned last month: 'People should not be in Parliament to add to their personal fortune.'

But Mr Cameron has defended the right of MPs to do second jobs - insisting that extra work can be fitted in alongside constituency duties, and it was voted down.  

Mr Hammond has come under criticism before and even faced a Parliamentary inquiry in 2012 after failing to declare his shareholding in a firm that receives tax breaks and the very next year it emerged he had used an offshore firm to buy his luxury second home in Portugal worth half a million pounds.

He was also revealed to be one of the most frequent users of the government's chauffeur-driven cars- using them 138 times a year despite living just six miles away from Westminster.

And in 2013 it came to light that Mr Hammond had demanded a £40,000 pay rise for MPs.

Stephen Hammond took the role just months after he was sacked as Secretary of State for Transport in the last re-shuffle

He had responded to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) review into MPs' pay with a call for their salaries to be increased to over £100,000 - a 60 per cent increase. 

Mr Hammond said he felt MPs should be paid the same as GPs, with an average salary of more than £105,000.

But his comments attracted huge criticism as he suggested the massive pay rise for ministers during the financial crisis and at a time when many salaries were still frozen.
