Commons Speaker John Bercow charged taxpayers £624 to have his chauffeur rush him to Devon for a ‘dirty weekend’ with wife Sally before she entered Celebrity Big Brother.

His official limo picked him up at Westminster and drove him 224 miles to his favourite seaside resort, Woolacombe, where his wife and family were staying last August.

Mrs Bercow has confessed that while there she used sex to persuade her husband to drop his opposition to her appearing on the Channel 5 reality programme.

‘I just used my feminine wiles and took John away for a dirty weekend in Devon,’ she said. ‘I gave him a weekend he wouldn’t forget, which left him happy, if breathless. He eventually gave in.’

She made her comments amid reports that their marriage was on the rocks over her determination to use the programme to become a television star.

Now figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that days before Mrs Bercow went on the show, the Speaker spent almost £800 of publicly funded expenses on a round trip between Woolacombe and Westminster.

He was on holiday in Devon, but was called back to Westminster to chair a one-day debate on the summer riots.

The trip back to London on August 10 
involved a £95 taxi to Exeter and a £40 rail fare to Paddington, where 
his chauffeur was waiting to take him to his official residence at a 
cost of £37.20.

However, when he returned to Woolacombe the next day, immed-iately after the debate ended at 8pm, he took the official car back at a cost of £624.72.

His decision to be driven back meant he could spend the night snuggled up to his wife instead of arriving the next day by train.

A spokesman for the Speaker defended the ride, saying: ‘Otherwise it would have taken him an extra 18 hours to get back to his family.’

However, he could have caught the 11.45pm ‘Night Riviera’ sleeper service to Barnstaple, which arrives at 7am (cost £49), jumped in a taxi for the 11-mile ride to Woolacombe (cost £25) and been back in Sally’s arms by 8am, a mere eight hours later than the limo, but saving tax-payers £550.

The couple remained in Devon until the end of the weekend, and on August 18 Mrs Bercow went into the Celebrity Big Brother house. The following day she was quoted as having told a friend about the ‘dirty weekend’. Shortly afterwards she became the first contestant to be voted off the show.

Mr Bercow flew straight to India – the £6,155 flights were also charged to the taxpayer – on official business, which enabled him to avoid the hullabaloo over Big Brother.

His spokesman said: ‘The Speaker and his family only took one week’s holiday last year. This coincided with the recall of Parliament, and by the time the debate finished it was too late to get back to his family other than by official car.’

The documents also revealed that Mr Bercow charged the taxpayer £1,320 for a shower screen and £80 to repair a roller blind in a ‘baby bedroom’ at his grace-and-favour apartment beneath Big Ben.

Between September 2010 and March 2012 he spent £45,825 on travel – most of it on international flights – including  £8,429.86 for the Speaker and a member of staff to fly to Washington and Boston.

The documents also revealed Mr Bercow spent almost £13,000 over three months on entertaining and hospitality, including £3,599 on a three-night trip to Rome to attend a G8 Speakers’ conference.
