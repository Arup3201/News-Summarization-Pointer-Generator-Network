The girl, who is believed to be aged 10 or 11, was spotted alone inside the branch of Foxtons in Heath Street, Hampstead, by passers-by at 10.30pm.

She could be seen wiping down tables and emptying bins at the agency, which sells multi-million pound homes across the capital and Surrey.

Anger: An upmarket estate agents has come under fire after this young girl was pictured cleaning its offices

Yesterday, Marcus Butler, who noticed the girl as he was walking past Foxtons with his friends, described the youngster's actions as 'child labour'.

The 38-year-old garden designer, from Hackney, told the Evening Standard: 'It’s
 just not right, it’s effectively child labour. She looked around 10 or 
11 years old and were saying to each other that she should be at home in
 bed like everyone else her age.

'Estate agents are earning a lot of money at the moment and, well, to see this, it just didn’t feel right.'

People across the UK have also taken to Twitter to express their disgust at the estate agents.

One user wrote: 'The result of pitiful wages and unrealistic work schedules for cleaners.'

Rachel Lasserson ‏said: 'Unbelievable. How is this possible?', while Jess Bowie added: 'This doesn't look at all good for Foxtons.'

A spokesman for Foxtons said the girl had been taken to the offices by her mother, who was employed by a cleaning 
contractor, after her childcare arrangements fell through.

She told the newspaper: 'It’s obviously something we are not happy with and they [the cleaning contractor] are not happy with, but these things happen and they will deal with it.'
