This is the moment a frustrated student turns the tables on his teacher and begins giving his own lecture.

Jeff Bliss launched into a tirade after being ordered to leave his World History class at Duncanville High School in Texas, reportedly for asking too many questions.

His impassioned speech telling his teacher Mrs Phung how to do her job, secretly filmed by a fellow classmate, has gone viral since it was posted on YouTube earlier this week.

Lecture: Jeff's impassioned speech was secretly filmed by a fellow pupil and uploaded to YouTube

As the long-haired student gets up to leave he tells her: 'If you would just get up and teach them instead of handing out a freaking packet. There's kids in here who don't learn like that. They need to learn face to face.

'You're just getting mad because I'm pointing out the obvious. You need kids to come in here and get excited for this. You can't expect kids to change if all you do is tell them.'

The video has been viewed more than 65,000 times and debate has raged as to whether Jeff was in the right or whether he should have shown his teacher more respect.Â

The student, who had only recently returned to school after dropping out, admitted to Fox4 News his attitude 'could have been better'.

Duncanville Independent School District said it was aware of the video and was 'addressing the situation'.

'As a district with a motto of Engaging Hearts and Minds we focus on building positive relationships with students and designing engaging work that is meaningful,' the district said in a statement.

'We want our students and teachers to be engaged, but the method by which the student expressed his concern could have been handled in a more appropriate way.'
