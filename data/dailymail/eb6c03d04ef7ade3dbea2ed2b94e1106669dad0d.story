Ian Poulter has hit back at the president of the PGA of America for calling him a 'Lil Girl', labelling the comments 'pretty shocking and disappointing'.

The Englishman, star of several Ryder Cup triumphs, released his autobiography earlier this week, making critical remarks about Tom Watson and Nick Faldo’s methods as captains in the Europe vs United States format.

Ted Bishop thought Poulter airing his opinion was disrespectful towards two of the greatest players of the game and made his thoughts known in a series of outbursts on his personal Twitter and Facebook pages in posts that have since been deleted.

Ian Poulter says that Ted Bishop's comments were 'pretty shocking and disappointing'

Poulter was part of the Europe Ryder Cup team at Gleneagles that won the trophy for the third straight time

Bishop posted the remarks on Twitter calling Poulter a 'lil girl' before later deleting it

He first wrote on Twitter: '@IanJamesPoulter -Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl. @NickFaldo006 @pgaofamerica.'

Bishop then expanded his point on Facebook, saying: “Used to be athletes who had lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticized the icons.

'Tom Watson (8 majors and a 10-3-1 Ryder Cup record) and Nick Faldo (6 majors and all-time Ryder Cup points leader) get bashed by Ian James Poulter. Really? Sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess. C’MON MAN!'

Poulter, himself yet to triumph in a major, was taken aback by the remark.

 'Is being called a “lil girl” meant to be derogatory or a put down?' Poulter told Golf Channel.

'That’s pretty shocking and disappointing, especially coming from the leader of the PGA of America. No further comment.'

Nick Faldo, skipper of the last European team that lost in 2008, also came in for some stick

The 38-year-old questioned Watson in his book, saying his captaincy at the recent Ryder Cup - which Europe won 16 1/2-11 1/2 - was “utterly bizarre” and handed the initiative to Europe.

Faldo, Europe’s all-time leading points scorer, also came in for criticism from Poulter for saying Sergio Garcia was 'useless' in 2008 in television commentary.

'Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said,” Poulter wrote in ‘No Limits’. 

'[2008] is the only Ryder Cup we’ve lost in the last 15 years. And he was captain.

'So who’s useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.'
