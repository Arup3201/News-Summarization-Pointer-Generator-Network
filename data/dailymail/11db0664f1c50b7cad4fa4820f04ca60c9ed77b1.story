A shocked couple found a dead bird in their Tesco salad - after they had started tucking into dinner.

James, 30, and Jasmine Watson, 32, of Yate, Gloucestershire, made the grisly find in a £1.50 bag of the supermarket's Babyleaf Rocket Salad when they began eating in dimmed light.

The five-inch bird, which Tesco later identified as a Blackcap European warbler, was inside the salad which Mrs Watson had ordered from the supermarket’s website three weeks ago on January 30.

The couple went into their local Tesco Extra store to complain - and a manager visited their home to remove the bird. The supermarket later apologised and offered a £200 gift card as compensation.

But sales director Mr Watson wants to know how the bird ended up in the salad. He said: ‘We could not believe it. We stood there, completely amazed, for at least two minutes.’

He added: ‘We had the food delivery a couple of days before and then had gone out for a few drinks on the Friday evening. We came back and were preparing dinner in the kitchen.

‘My wife was cooking some scallops and steak and I prepared the salad. I opened the bag, tipped it into a salad bowl and cut up some other salad bits and put them on top.

‘Then I served the salad on some plates. We sat down at the breakfast bar and only had a few low lights on so we were effectively eating by candlelight.

‘I took three mouthfuls and then saw it. My first reaction was why have I got a soggy fishcake on my plate? But this was a full-size dead bird.’

Unable to contact Tesco's customer services, the couple went to the local Tesco Extra store that evening.

The store manager visited their home the following day and removed the food.

Since then, the firm has apologised and offered a £200 gift card by way of compensation.

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We were concerned to learn of this issue and have investigated thoroughly with our supplier.

‘Both we and our suppliers have robust 
measures in place to prevent incidents such as this, and our salad 
leaves go through complex filtering and washing systems.

‘We have been in contact with our 
customer to reassure them how seriously we have taken this matter, and 
offered them a gesture of goodwill.’

But Mr Watson said he had not been offered any explanation as to how the dead bird got into the salad bag.

He added: ‘I want to know how it 
happened. I would really like someone from Tesco to sit down and explain
 me how an animal so large got into a bag of salad not so large.

'If it was a maggot or something I could almost understand it, but how a whole bird was not picked up - I have just been gobsmacked by the whole thing.

'The magnitude of this was disgraceful. I find the offer of compensation a bit of an insult.’

The gruesome find comes after horsemeat was discovered in four products sold at Tesco.

Tests
 on beef products revealed positive results on Frozen Everyday Value 
Burgers and Spaghetti 
Bolognese, Frozen Quarterpounders and Flamehouse Frozen Chargrilled Quarterpounders.

Another couple found a dead bird inside the same type of Tesco salad just 15 months ago.

Paul Streeter and his vegetarian partner Julia Flynn, of Brinscombe, Somerset, found the bird after serving a portion of the salad on a plate.

The four-inch long dark coloured bird's skeletal remains were among the leaves, which were bought from a store in Burnham-on-Sea.

Tesco said at the time that it was investigating. A company spokesman could not immediately comment with any update on the probe today.

Last December a mother preparing a stuffing mix opened a Tesco bag of herbs when a six-legged live praying mantis jumped out.

Linda Hebditch, of Poole, Dorset, found the insect scurrying amongst the leaves imported from Israel in the 30g packet that cost 80p.
