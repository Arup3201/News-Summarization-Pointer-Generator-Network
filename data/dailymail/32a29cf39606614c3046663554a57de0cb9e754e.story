If the Jacksonville Jaguars are going to be victorious against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday at Wembley, the key to victory will likely be shutting down Big D – big DeMarco Murray that is.

After battling through a number of injury-plagued seasons, the 26-year-old is putting together one of the best years a running back not named Adrian Peterson has had in recent memory.

With 1,133 rushing yards on only 225 carries through the first nine weeks of the season, Murray has an outside shot at breaking Eric Dickerson’s single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards.

Last Sunday in Dallas the Arizona Cardinals held Murray under 100 rushing yards for the first time this season, an accomplishment the Jaguars hope to emulate this Sunday.

The Cardinals may have supplied the blueprint, but Jacksonville head coach Gus Bradley knows stopping Murray won’t be easy.

‘He’s got a unique style, a style all of his own because he has power and he can make people miss. That combination, you can see why he’s the leading rusher. Just really good patience, good poise.’

Sen'Derrick Marks, who has 21 tackles and four sacks this year, called Murray ‘tough to bring down’.

‘The majority of the time DeMarco has great vision, great feet. He can make all the cuts, he can make all the moves to get back to the outside so they work well together and they get a pretty good push,’ the defensive tackle added. 

‘He’s a phenomenal back,' safety Johnathan Cyprien said. 'He’s leading the NFL right now. We definitely have a challenge. We’re gonna have to come up to the challenge and make sure that we do much better than we did last week.’

The Jaguars surrendered 191 yards to the Cincinnati Bengals on only 34 rushing attempts last week, a mark Cyprien is aware they will have to improve upon.

‘We definitely have to clean it up. The longer runs that we gave up and some fundamental things like when the running back would cut back and get open. We don’t want to allow any open-field or explosive runs. We could have played a better game in the last one,’ the 24-year-old said.

Murray has been stellar thus far, but the Cowboys offensive line is undoubtedly one of the reasons he’s had so much success.

Bradley acknowledged that if Dallas’ line isn’t the best Jacksonville has faced, it’s ‘up there’. He said:

‘The offensive line is a real factor in this game. I think when you watch them, the athleticism they have at both tackle spots really jumps out at you. Just the whole offensive line, that combination along with his skill set is a good match for him.’

Marks concurred, saying: ‘It’s going to be tough. They’ve got a real good offensive line. They gel together well, they run the ball well.’

‘We have to make sure that we continue to stay in our gaps and get hats on them, get people to the ball and get them to the ground. I think it’s going to be difficult for us but we should be able to handle it.’

According to former Jacksonville and New England Patriot running back Fred Taylor Murray is ‘gonna get his runs’ no matter what the Jaguars do.

Taylor would know. The 38-year-old scored 74 touchdowns and accounted for more than 14,000 combined yards during his 13 years in the NFL. He said:

‘He has a great offensive line, big guys. They’re going to run it, especially with Tony Romo possibly being out. The way to defend him is not let him get outside. You have to keep him contained in the interior and hit his legs. You don’t want him high too much because he gets stronger as the game goes on.’

Whether Romo plays or not, Jacksonville will have to bottle Murray up early and shut him down late if they want to emerge with a big W against Big D.
