The miracle koala who clung for his life to the grille of a car for nearly 90kms after being hit, has recovered from his injuries and released back into the wild.

Nicknamed Blinky Grille, the koala arrived at the Australia Zoo Wildlife hospital four weeks ago after colliding with a car on the Bruce Highway, three hours north of Brisbane.

Blinky surprised staff at the hospital by escaping with minimal injuries, suffering just a broken toenail, superficial trauma to the nose and a case of Chlamydia, which is common in the marsupials.

All his ailments have been successfully treated.

Timberwolf the miracle Koala released back into the wild after being in treatment at Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital for four weeks.

Dr Amber Gillett, the Senior Veterinarian at Australia Zoo who treated the koala, was thrilled to see him released after treating him for the past month.

'Not all koalas that come into contact with cars are so lucky, which is why being able to release Timberwolf was the best result we could have hoped for,' said Dr Gillett.

He was found at a service station near Gympie after he was hit by a car at Maryborough 90 kilometers away.

Blinky Grill was lucky enough that the owner of the car he'd clung to took him to a local vet, who then had him taken into the care of vets at Australia Zoo.

Blinky Grille, hailed a miracle koala, was released in a large koala habitat bushland outside of Maryborough.

'Timberwolf leapt from one eucalypt to another' on his release back in the wild

Once released he leapt from one eucalyptus tree to another, giving Dr Gillett confidence that he would remain the survivor that came through the hospital doors at the end of July.

'Timberwolf is a tough koala and the fact that he's exploring his environment confidently indicates that he's still fit and healthy after being in care with us for three weeks,' she said.

Timberwolf nicknamed Blinky Grille was x-rayed on arrival at the Australia Zoo wildlife hospital to check the extent of his injuries

The Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital sees more than 800 koala patients each year.

More than half of these are suffering from trauma caused by being hit by cars and other vehicles, followed closely by injuries from domestic dog attacks and disease.

The Wildlife Hospital relies on donations from the public to continue its work to help koalas like Timberwolf and ultimately safeguard the species.
