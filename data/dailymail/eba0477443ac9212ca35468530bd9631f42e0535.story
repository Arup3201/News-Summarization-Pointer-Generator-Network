The Texas high schooler who told off his teacher for being lazy, in a video that went viral this week, says in a new interview that he has no regrets about his in-class rant.

Jeff Bliss, a sophomore at Duncanville High School in Texas, said that someone needed to stand up to the instructor who he accused of relying too much on handouts and not actually teaching.

'I want to see a teacher stand up and interact with the students, get involved, discuss, talk, question and get deep into the subject,' he told WFAA-TV on Thursday.

Impassioned: Jeff Bliss, a student at Duncanville High School in Texas, says he has no regrets about launching a tirade about his teacher's poor performance in the classroom

No holds barred: Jeff Bliss, 18, gave his teacher a tongue lashing in a 90-second video that was uploaded to YouTube and has been viewed over 2 million times

The 18-year-old told the local news station that the monologue criticizing his world history teacher, believed to be Julie Phung, was sparked by a complaint he made in class about how students didn't have enough time to prepare for the STAAR test.

STARR, the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, are standardized tests given to students in grades three to 11.

The teacher kicked him out of the class for asking too many questions and Bliss decided to seize the moment and lay out his thoughts on her less than impressive teaching style.

'If you would just get up and teach 
them instead of handing out a freaking packet. There's kids in here who 
don't learn like that. They need to learn face to face,' he said in his impassioned plea, that was recorded by a classmate.

As the student exited the room, he began unleashing on the woman and telling her that she could do a better job engaging with the students.

'You want kids to come to class? You want them to get excited? You gotta come in here, you gotta make 'em excited, to change him and make him better, you gotta touch his freakin' heart,' he added.

The 90-second video was uploaded to the web on May 8 and took the web by storm.

In just a few days it has been viewed over 2 million times and many have come out to support the articulate student delivering his dreams of better education in the classroom.

Bliss said he has no regrets about his speech but didn't expect this kind of attention.

'I believe that someone needed to say this,' he told the news station.

Pride: Jeff Bliss's mother Rhonda, back right, is a teacher and is proud that her son was confident enough to speak his mind

The student's mother is a teacher and he said that he learned the value of education when he dropped out of school for one year.Â 

'Without an education, I'm not going to make any steps forward into the future,' he added.

Bliss' mother, Rhonda, has come out to support her son and is proud that he spoke his mind.

The school has responded, saying that it encourages students to be engaged but believes Bliss could have found a more appropriate way to vent his feelings.

Duncanville ISD Superintendent Alfred Ray told the local news, 'I think the setting and the tone could have very well been different. I think that Mr Bliss probably understands that himself, but I tell you that our core beliefs value all of the individuals in our district and we value the input Jeff has as we would for every student in our district.'

Aftermath: Officials at Duncanville High School have placed the teacher on administrative leave and are investigating what led the student to launch his scathing criticism

The district announced this week that they wouldn't be punishing Jeff for the rant.

Meanwhile, the teacher in the video has been placed on administrative leave while the school investigates what led to Bliss being kicked out of class.

He alleges she said something profane to him before he launched into his tirade.

Though Bliss' speech has become wildly popular, he also has his critics.

'His choice of protest venues and methods is one I will never celebrate,' Dallas Morning News editorial writer Ted Robberson wrote in an op-ed on Friday.

'He owes everyone involved an apology. And if he ever makes it onto the Today show, that might be an excellent venue to do it.'
