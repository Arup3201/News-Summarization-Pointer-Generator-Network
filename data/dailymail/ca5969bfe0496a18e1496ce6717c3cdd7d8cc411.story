These photos capture the moment a hunt master was hurled from his horse into a muddy ditch during a mock fox hunt.

Mercifully Jersey's master of the hounds Mark Evans escaped unharmed from the fall - which was captured frame-by-frame by a local photographer.

The island's veteran huntsman climbed out of the four-foot hole with little more than a few mud splatters on his sharp green-and-white uniform.

Drama: The horse drew back in surprise as the master of the Jersey Drag Hunt fell towards the ground

Mr Evans, who has taken part in the Jersey Drag Hunt for almost 20 years, was thrown from his horse Bonnie when she pulled up at the last moment.

There are no foxes on Jersey, so instead hounds follow an artificially-created scent which is laid down by two horsemen who ride ahead of the rest of the pack.

Photographer Ian Le Sueur, who captured the fall on Wednesday, said: 'They 
came hacking across a field towards this ditch, which the hounds had no 
trouble with - but it obviously proved too much for Bonnie.

'Half way across she changed her mind without telling her rider, who was propelled over the top.

'Thankfully nothing more than pride was hurt. Mark extricated himself from the hole and he and Bonnie continued the hunt.'

Safe: Mr Evans is barely visible in the deep ditch below, but miraculously he escaped without a scratch

Mr Evans was leading the hounds through fields in the parish of St John, on the northern side of the island.

His hunt claims to be one of the oldest in the British isles and was started in about 1884 by army officers who were stationed in the Channel Islands.

Hounds are imported from Hampshire and Surrey for the twice-weekly event, which is popular with farmers on the island.
