Concerns are growing amongst residents of the upmarket Hamptons that their exclusive beaches are set to be overrun by less desirable visitors this summer driven north by Superstorm Sandy’s devastating impact on the Jersey Shore.

For so long an exclusive enclave for the rich and famous, the group of villages and hamlets which form the South Fork of Long Island, New York have some of the most expensive residential properties in the U.S.

Last year, a young and rowdy party crowd started regularly showing up at Indian Wells Beach in East Hampton.

The beach is so exclusive that only cars with the blue-and-white permits of local homeowners can parked in its lot, but the out-of-towners got around this by being dropped off and picked up by buses and vans - at least one was seen flying a pirate flag.

Suddenly locals were faced with over-crowded beaches full of twenty-somethings hauling kegs of beer, out for a good time and not concerned about not fitting in with the local khakis and blue blazer brigade.

This year residents throughout the Hamptons are bracing themselves for an even greater invasion exacerbated they fear by Superstorm Sandy having destroyed the more traditional habitat of this young crowd – the Jersey Shore.

Paranoia is growing that Indian Wells Beach and others will be overrun with the type of reckless young party-goers best personified by Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi and the rest of the Gudios and Guidettes from the cast of MTV’s ‘Jersey Shore’ reality show.

Hamptons locals have complained about an influx of young out-of-towners who travel to their beaches via coaches to avoid the rules preventing them from parking by the beach

‘You don’t want to come across as snooty, but it’s about peace and quiet for all of us,’ said Dayna Winter, 49, a registered dietician and a year-round resident told The New York Times. ‘It’s not a party scene; it’s not what we want it to become.’

‘With the devastation of Sandy,’ she added, ‘we’re all a little nervous.’

Other residents fear their neighbourhood is in danger of losing its identity and in one local’s words is in danger of ‘becoming Cancun during Spring Break.’

The old money set has already had to endure the arrival of the nouveau riche  - most recently Jennifer Lopez - with their mega-mansions, corporate planes and over-the-top tent parties, but an even greater fear it seems is this new group of day-trippers hell-bent on having a good time.

In a bid to see off the packed buses and vans driving through the residents-only parking lot, a weekend ban on allowing parking lot non-resident vehicles longer than 30 feet or carrying more than eight passengers are being considered.

‘There was a time when you had to be on the inside to be part of the Hamptons, and that’s not true anymore,’ East Hampton-based author Steven Gaines told The Times.

‘It’s become a tourist stop, and it has lost some of its exclusivity.’

Meanwhile Snooki and the rest of the 'Jersey Shore' cast where in Seaside Heights, N.J. on Friday to help open the resort for summer, even if it is still very much a work in progress.

Saws and sledgehammers joined beer and barbecues as a fixture of the first Memorial Day weekend at the Jersey shore since Superstorm Sandy roared through.

Seven months after the devastating storm pummeled large swaths of the shore, the tourists made their way back, though many substituted porch parties for a day at the beach on Saturday due to rain that has lingered since Thursday.

Speaking on 'Today' on Friday, Snooki declared: 'Everyone’s here and it’s getting rebuilt.'

The residents of the Hamptons will be hoping those words will be enough to encourage Snooki's fellow Guidettes and Guidos to party at the Shore rather than taking a trip further north.
