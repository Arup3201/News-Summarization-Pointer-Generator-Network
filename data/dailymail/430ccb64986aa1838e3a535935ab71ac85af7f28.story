Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has warned Real Madrid that Ramires is 'not for sale' as Carlo Ancelotti continues his pursuit of the Brazilian midfielder.

Ancelotti is keen to be reunited with a player he originally brought to Stamford Bridge in 2010 from Benfica but Mourinho is not willing to let his Madrid counterpart sign the 27-year-old.

The Portuguese is in the process of rebuilding his Chelsea squad and he sees Ramires as an integral member of his side going forward - despite the £30million acquisition of Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas.

Industrious: Ramires is a hard-working midfielder who has been an ever-present in Mourinho's side

Mourinho believes both players can help Chelsea progress and create a 'very complete midfield'.

He told Marca: 'Ramires is staying at Chelsea. He's not for sale.

'I have an excellent friendship with important people within Real Madrid and they know that Ramires is going to stay at Chelsea.

'Cesc is a great player who adds a new 
dimension to our side. He is different to Matic, Ramires and Oscar. We 
will have a very complete midfield with him.'

Keen: Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, who signed Ramires for Chelsea in 2010, wants to bring him to Spain

The 51-year-old was also quick to distance himself from reports that he was interested in signing French defender Raphael Varane or German midfielder Sami Khedira from Los Blancos.

'They know that Ramires is not leaving, 
but they also know that I'm not interested in any Real Madrid players,' he said.

Ramires himself told Marca of his admiration for former boss Ancelotti, describing him as a 'very special coach'.

However, Mourinho seems unwilling to allow his industrious midfielder to move to the Spanish capital and will do everything in his power to keep the Brazilian in west London.

Ramires has played 196 times for Chelsea, scoring 26 goals.
