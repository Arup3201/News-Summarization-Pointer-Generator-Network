A 'heavily intoxicated' Bristol Palin screamed 'who the f**k are you?' at the male host of the South Anchorage party her family gate-crashed last month before punching him at least six times in the face, according to the police report released today.

Witnesses to the booze-soaked brawl involving nearly every member of Sarah Palin's family told police that Bristol, 23, was 'out of control' and accused her of striking Korey Klingenmeyer repeatedly before he pushed her to the ground in defense, sparking the 20-person fight.

According to police who responded to the chaotic scene, Bristol claimed that Klingenmeyer was calling her a 'c**t and s**t' and that after he pushed her over someone began dragging her 'around on the grass by her feet'.

However, Klingenmeyer told police that when they arrived he was furious 'the Palins had showed up and were causing the problems' and added for good measure, 'a fight broke out and the Palins ended up losing.'

Family fun: Todd Palin, 50, with son Trig, six, Sarah, 50, Bristol, 23, with her son Tripp, six, Willow, 20 and Track, 26, with his daughter Kyla Grace, three

The police report paints a confusing picture of the huge fight, with each version of events from those involved differing wildly, no doubt impaired by alcohol.

Indeed, it is not clear from any of the witnesses who started the fight and the report essentially boils down into a he-said, she-said situation.

However, while blame may not be clear, the police report which dates from the night of father Todd Palin's 50th birthday celebration on September 6, lists Bristol Palin as a suspect, her brother Track, 26, as a victim and Sarah Palin and her husband as witnesses.

It also lists Willow Palin, 20, as a 'person interviewed.'

The Palins had been celebrating Todd's birthday at a do in their home town of Wasilla and had decided to go to their friend Klingenmeyer's house afterwards as he was also having a party.

Klingenmeyer, who has decided not to press charges in connection with the alcohol-inspired melee, claims that a fight started out front of his house and that Bristol came out the back where he was and began punching him repeatedly after crossed words.

When he stopped her punching him again, pushing her to the floor - her brother and father ran over and began fighting, sparking a brawl involving at least four men.

Bristol Palin claims that the fight began when an 'older woman' allegedly pushed her little sister Willow and that Klingenmeyer became involved, calling her a 'sl**', pushing her to the ground and that the brawl erupted from there.

Willow Palin told police that during the huge fight, many people were shouting 'f*** the Palins'. 

Klingenmeyer, who police described as only 'moderately intoxicated' said that he initially wanted to file charges against Palin.

He said that he was told a fight had broken out in the front of his house in the cul de sac and that he had told everyone at the party in his house not to get involved.

He claims he stayed at the back of his property and waited there but Bristol Palin and her sister Willow came round.

Klingenmeyer then says that Bristol told him she was going to 'knock that b***h out' at which point he claims he says he told her he wouldn't stand for that language and advised her to go home.

Infuriated by this she asked him 'Who the f**k are you?', to which he replied he was the owner of the house and that he wanted no fighting.

The police report states that Bristol then told him that he was lying, this was not his house and that she was going to 'kick his ass'.

Klingenmeyer then told police that Sarah Palin's eldest daughter punched him in the face, to which he replied, 'hit me again if that makes you feel better.' At which point Bristol Palin did.

Allegations: Host Korey Klingenmeyer (above) was allegedly punched in the face up to eight times by Bristol when he asked her to leave the party

Husband Todd Palin - who was celebrating his fiftieth that night although it was not his party- became involved

The host alleges that Palin punched him in total up to eight times  in the face and that 'she was hitting pretty hard.'

Klingenmeyer then told police that on the sixth punch thrown he put out his hand to stop Palin and pushed her back, at which point she fell over.

She got up, he claimed and tried to throw another punch and he pushed her away using her fist again.

'At this time three or four guys come up the driveway and one was yelling that they were going to beat his ass for beating his sister.'

For her part, Bristol Palin told police that while they were at the birthday party, an older lady, believed to be the mother of Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, pushed Sarah Palin's youngest daughter.

Bristol responded strongly to this and claims that Klingenmeyer approached her while she was tackling the older woman and pushed her to the ground, calling her 's**t' over and over.

She then claims that she was dragged around on the grass by her feet after being pushed over and that someone stole her shoes and sunglasses.

One witness told police that after Todd weighed in to combat Klingemeyer he was jumped on by four people and that Track ran in to help his father.

Todd, who arrived with his family to Klingenmeyer's home just after 10pm, emerged from the scrum with a torn shirt and a bloody lip according to the police report.

Indeed, when police arrived at the Anchorage home around midnight they saw Track walking towards his mother's limo, shirtless and one officer noted that Track's friends seemed, 'intent on keeping him away from me.'.

The police report describes Track as appearing 'heavily intoxicated' and that he had blood on his hands and around his mouth.

He also seemed to have been hit under his left eye and was 'belligerent' when officers first approached him.

He only agreed to speak to officers when his mother made him exit her limo and give officers his version of events. 

Track was 'angry and intoxicated' and told police that 'some guys were talking rudely to his sisters, making them cry.'

The report states that as they tried to leave the party, a friend of his was sucker punched and knocked to the ground.

'Track said he then confronted one of the guys and said he would fight him, so Track took off his shirt to fight,' wrote one officer.

However, at this point, Track claims he was attacked from behind by four 'skinny white males'.

Todd Palin told police that when this happened, 'everything escalated and it was a situation they couldn't walk away from.'

Another witness, Matthew McKenna, told the police that 'about four unknown guys then jumped on Todd,' and that Track 'jumped in and was fighting with the people that jumped his dad.'

And as if to compound the confusion from the police report, another witness, Brian Horschel told police that during the brawl, Track tried to 'start a fight with his dad'.

McKenna said that he felt 'the problem was that Bristol and Willow were drunk as were their boyfriends.'

And he said that after Bristol punched Klingenmeyer, 'a bunch of wives tackled her ass'.

The police report makes it clear that Sarah Palin was not involved in the physical fighting and was waiting inside the family's white limousine during the altercation, helping to calm everything down afterwards.

She did not give a statement to the police on the fight. 

The former vice-presidential candidate has not commented publicly on the episode, but RealClearPolitics spoke with a source close to the Palin family last month, who wanted to provide their version of the events in question. 

The source said oldest son Track, 26, soon found himself struggling against four men who had 'piled on him' after his sister was knocked to the ground by Klingenmeyer.

That was when father Todd Palin - who was celebrating his 50th that night, although it was not his party- became involved.

Partygoer Eric Thompson told Good Morning America, 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, "You know who we are, don’t you?"

But the source told the website Palin was shouting: 'Don't you know who he is? He's a vet!'

Her son Track served with the U.S. Army service in the Iraq War. 

Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. 

She wrote: 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly.'

But the source said that Bristol is left-handed.

One report suggested host Korey Klingenmeyer was allegedly punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party. 

Another report claimed that Willow and Bristol apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend.

The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said. 

'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,' police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News. 

Scene of the crime: The home of Klingenmeyer in Anchorage, Alaska

'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence.

'At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made.

'Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.'

Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office.
