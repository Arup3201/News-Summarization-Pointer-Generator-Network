This week's 45th anniversary of man's first landing on the moon is being celebrated at the White House in Washington D.C.

President Barack Obama met with representatives of the Apollo 11 mission in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning.

Apollo 11 landed on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969. Astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon, died two years ago.

Armstrong's fellow crew members, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, were among those who met with Obama, along with Armstrong's widow, Carol.

NASA administrator Charles Bolden and White House science and technology official Patricia Falcone also participated in the private meeting.

'One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, ‘said Neil Armstrong  as he landed on the surface of the moon 45 years ago and left the first footprint in the new age of space travel.

The spacecraft’s two parts consisted of the command module called the Columbia manned by Collins and the Eagle manned by Armstrong and Aldrin.

'The Eagle has landed,' Armstrong famously said as the Eagle safely arrived at a moon basin called The Sea of Tranquility with only 40 seconds of fuel left to burn.

After Armstrong set foot on our moon, Buzz Aldrin followed behind him and the two men read from a plaque that said, 'Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.'

Collins stayed on the Columbia and orbited the moon, though he was no less a part of the historic mission.

Watched by over 600 million people around the world, Apollo 11 became the first spacecraft with human passengers to land on the moon.

CNN reports that Neil Armstrong acted as the commander, Buzz Aldrin was the lunar module pilot and Michael Collins acted as the command module pilot.

The crew traveled 240,000 miles from Earth to the moon in just 76 hours.

Networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC spent somewhere between $11 and $12 million on coverage from Apollo 11 and covered the mission from Sunday morning to Monday evening.

Networks televised a two-minute call between President Nixon who spoke to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin by radio from the Oval Office of the white house in what some call 'the most historic phone call ever made.'

Buzz Aldrin took to social media this week to talk about meeting yup with Michael Collins and to post what may be the 'best selfie ever.'

Though Armstrong died two years ago and wasn't able to celebrate the 45th anniversary, Aldrin said that he knew he's be there in spirit.
