The Western New York Flash have been forced to play Sunday's 4 p.m. season opener without their star forward, Abby Wambach, who has suffered a broken bone beneath her left eye.

The 33-year-old sustained the injury â€” a broken orbital bone â€” on a collision with a Chinese player during the second half of the United States' 3-0 win in San Diego on Thursday, according to Democrat and Chronicle.

It happened when the players smacked heads going up in the air for a header.

A release from the Flash said Wambach's long-term status is 'day-to-day'.

Wambach led WNY in scoring last year with 11 goals and eight assists in 19 matches.

She ranked second in the National Women's Soccer League in both categories and was runner-up for MVP of the pro league in its inaugural season.
