A holidaymaker who lost his camera overboard while kayaking in Australia six months ago is set to get his holiday snaps back in tact after it was discovered in a river.

Traveller Chris Hesford, from Jersey was kayaking with friends off the coast of New South Wales when a rogue wave swept away his GoPro camera.

Chris was halfway through a round-the-world trip and lost two months' worth of photos with the camera, which he never expected to see again.

British backpacker Chris Hedford, from Jersey, was on an amazing round-the-world trip when he lost his camera

But last week Australian Steve Carmody contacted the 22-year-old out of the blue via Facebook to say he had found his camera - in a riverbed 60 miles away from where it was lost.

And despite six months of being dragged underwater, the 32GB memory card was still in tact.

Law student Chris, 22, who lives in London, said: 'I got a message out of the blue from an Australian man, who said he'd found my camera.

'I was astonished - I thought it was lost for good.

The GoPro contained images of Chris' travels so far and he didn't have any copies of the pictures taken

The backpacker had travelled tgrough America, to Dubai and enjoyed the sunshine in Fiji before arriving in the United States

'Steve found the camera, and uploaded a couple of pictures to Facebook and started a campaign to try and find its owner.

'I think it took about two weeks, but it went viral and somebody recognised me.

'I couldn't believe it - I thought at first he was pulling my leg, but he wasn't, and now the camera is in the post on its way to me. What a nice guy.'

Chris lost his camera near Byron Bay in September last year, but it was found by Australian Steve, who decided to start a campaign to find its owner.

Chris Hesford was travelling alone so snapped plenty of selfies at iconic sites like the horse shoe bend in the Grand Caynon

The 22-year-old globetrotter also visited New York City on his travels before heading down to Fiji and Australia

Logging on to Facebook, Steve wrote: 'OK Facebook do your thing. If we can track down this bloke I have 32 GB of precious memories to be returned.

'If you lost a GoPro in the surf at Fingal Rovers SLSC in NSW Australia, the camera has been found on Fingal Beach at the Tweed River mouth.

'Bad news is the GoPro is dead, but your memory stick survives. Inbox me if you know this bloke.'

Chris is now waiting for the GoPro and memory card to land in the post within the next couple of days.

The Australian, Steve Carmody, who found the camera posted some of Chris' pictures on Facebook in his bid to find Chris

Chris' camera contained a whopping 32GB of pictures and video of his trip, which took in Washington (pictured) New York and Arizona

The iconic tourist snaps were Chris' way to document the once-in-a-lifetime trip but were all lost when his camera fell overboard

The images record his travels across America and Fiji before he arrived in Australia and he had only been in the country for a week before he lost the camera.

Chris added: 'I was just in shock, really - I thought they were gone for good.

'The pictures were of my trip of a lifetime, so I was really upset by losing them.

'It's amazing that Steve made such an incredible effort to find me.

'I will be eternally grateful to Steve - and if he's ever in London I'm definitely buying the first pint.

'He's asked for nothing in return - he's just a good Aussie bloke who has really shown the good in humanity.'

Despite spending six months underwater and travelling a total of 60 miles, the camera's memory card survived in tact

Chris also travelled via Dubai, where he managed to take a pictures of himself stood by the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel

One of the last pictures taken before Chris lost his camera shows him posing at Sydney Harbour after he had arrived in Australia

Steve's Facebook post was shared by more than 8,000 users, and it is thought an acquaintance of Chris spotted him in the picture and pointed Steve in the right direction.

Steve said: 'It's very cool, it just goes to show the power of social media.'
