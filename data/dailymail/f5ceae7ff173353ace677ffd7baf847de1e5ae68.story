A college football player who was convicted of rape and expelled from the Air Force Academy is finding his way into the public spotlight again - this time as a college football star in Mississippi. 

Jamil Cooks, 23, is a defensive end for the Alcorn State University Braves and has been one of the team's standout players this year. 

In 2013, he was convicted of sexual assault and expelled from the US Air Force Academy as part of a crackdown on sexual violence.

Cooks must register as a sex offender. His registered address is a dorm on the Alcorn State campus

He must register as a sex offender in the state of Mississippi. His address is listed as a dorm on campus. 

Alcorn State, a historically black university with 3,900 students, has seemingly welcomed him with open arms.

A spokesman for the college told ABC News that the university has 'no problem' with his enrollment there.

Incredibly, the NCAA has no rules barring convicted sex offenders from competing in college sports.  

Cooks had been a standout players on the Air Force Academy football team before he was arrested in 2012 on allegations that he raped a woman in her dorm room on the Colorado Springs campus in 2011, the Colorado Spring Gazette reports.

Cooks' lawyer says the player was falsely accused and that the woman came forward because she was angry he didn't want a relationship.

Cooks was also charged with unlawfully entering the dorms of two other female cadets.

In 2013, he was convicted of sexual assault by a court martial and sentenced to time served, about a year. He was expelled from the school and kicked out of the Air Force. 

Alcorn State has refused to comment on why officials allowed Cooks to join the team.

The fifth-year senior was named the university's athlete of the week earlier this season after recording six tackles, three of them for a loss, and one sack. 

Two weeks ago against Texas Southern University he recorded six tackles and three and a half sacks, for a total loss of 11 yards.
