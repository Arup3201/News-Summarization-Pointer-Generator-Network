Child killer Subhan Anwar was murdered in his cell

A prison has been criticised for taking 50 minutes to call in medics after two inmates strangled a child killer with a pair of jogging bottoms in his cell.

An official report into the murder of Subhan Anwar at Worcestershire's Long Lartin Prison found the authorities took 50 minutes to call in paramedics who then took a further 30 minutes to reach the prison's rural location. 

The report also revealed the two killers, Gary Smith, 49, and Lee Newell, 45, had both taken hostages during earlier, but separate, prison sieges in 2007 and 2011. 

Smith and Newell, who were already serving life sentences for murders committed in the 1980s and 1990s, blamed each other for the death of Anwar.

The pair had only moved on to the vulnerable prisoner wing because they owed prison drug debts. 

The convicted murderers tied up and strangled Anwar with a pair of jogging bottoms in his cell in a vulnerable prisoner wing on Valentine's Day last year.  

After Anwar was strangled, Smith calmly made Newell a cup of hot chocolate - even sweetening it with icing sugar - during a stand-off with prison staff.

Prison staff were initially told Anwar had been taken hostage because the two inmates were 'bored' - with Newell telling a warder: 'He's gone, he's with Allah.'

Both defendants opted not to give evidence at the trial, but CCTV and DNA evidence proved they were involved in the killing.

A post mortem examination found Anwar's neck had been broken.

They were found guilty of murdering the 24-year-old  last September following a two-week trial at Warwick Crown Court.

Newell also confessed to stealing a watch, prayer beads and a metal earring belonging to Anwar, while Smith admitted the theft of property from the child-killer's cell. 

In the report from the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, it said Newell had 47 prison disciplinary adjudications against him while Smith had 32 proven disciplinary adjudications between 1999 and 2011.

The report added: 'Both men had previously been involved in hostage-taking, but there had been no recent evidence to indicate that either of them posed any significant risk of violence to other prisoners.'

It criticised the time it took for an ambulance to be called, and said: 'While it would not have altered the outcome for the man, we consider that an ambulance should have been called as soon as it became apparent that there was the possibility of serious injury which would require immediate medical attention.

'A delay in calling an ambulance could have serious consequences in future hostage incidents where a prisoner is still alive. We therefore make the following recommendation: the Governor of Long Lartin should ensure that in the event of a hostage incident, staff call an ambulance immediately if there is any indication that a prisoner has been, or could be, injured.' 

Sanam Navsarka suffered 107 injuries during a month of 'unbelievable' cruelty before she died

Anwar, a salesman from Huddersfield, was serving a life sentence for killing his partner's two-year-old daughter, Sanam Navsarka. 

The youngster suffered 107 injuries during a month of 'unbelievable' cruelty in which she was battered with metal poles and had all four limbs broken.

The child, who was afraid of the dark, was 'disciplined' by being repeatedly locked in an unlit cupboard, while Anwar also put her in a tumble drier and dumped her in a bin for his amusement.

Sanam suffered further agony when aftershave was splashed on her nappy rash and open sores. She was not taken to a doctor, so her fractures remained untreated.

In her final days she was suffering so much from her injuries that she could not walk and died when fat deposits from her broken bones entered the bloodstream.

A post-mortem examination revealed that along with her broken arms and legs, there were 36 bruises to her head and neck, 26 to her arms and ten to her abdomen.  

Her mother Zahbeena Navsarka, then 21, was sentenced to nine years in jail after she was cleared of her daughter's murder but found guilty of manslaughter.

A prison service spokesman said: 'We will look closely at the findings of the inquest and any report the coroner may make to see what lessons can be learned.'

A response from the prison to the report read: 'The relevant contingency plans have now been updated to specifically state that an ambulance is called immediately.'
