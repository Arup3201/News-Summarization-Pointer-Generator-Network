One of the most cherished old buildings in Manhattan - a tiny wooden farmhouse nestled between highrises - might get torn down to make way for condos.

The 1,000-square-foot home, which is at 121 Charles St. in the storied West Village neighborhood, has been listed as a 'development site' priced at $20 million.

Preservationists are outraged, saying that anyone who tries to demolish the house will 'have a mighty fight on their hands,' reports the Daily News.

Very inviting: The little farmhouse stands out among all the larger apartment buildings around it

'This is one of the most beloved and historic corners of the Village,' said Andrew Berman, of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. 'We and many others would fight very hard to keep it that way.'

The building's owner, Suri Bieler, who is behind the sale and refused to comment, chose to list it exclusively with ERG Property Advisors, a Manhattan-based commercial real estate firm. She bought it in 1988.Â 

Ms Bieler, who is president of a prop-styling company, told The New York Times in 2008 that she had 'pined for the 
house since she was a child in the 1960s, when she spotted it from the 
back of her parents' station wagon.'

She said people frequently send her old pictures of the property, evidence of its sentimental value to New Yorkers.

Though Ms Bieler wouldn't tell the Times what she bought it for, a previous owner said she sold it to someone in 1986 for $725,000.

The farmhouse was built during the 1800s and, interestingly, it was originally located on the Upper East Side. It was moved by trucks down Second Avenue in 1967 to avoid demolition by the Archdiocese of New York, which wanted to replace it with senior housing.

Another tidbit: Margaret Wise Brown, author of the popular childhood book 'Goodnight Moon' lived in the house during the 1940s.

The property's listing calls its 5,000-square-foot lot a 'large blank canvas for a developer or user to execute a wide variety of potential visions, from boutique condominiums, apartments, or a one-of-a-kind family residence.'

There is no mention of the farmhouse.
