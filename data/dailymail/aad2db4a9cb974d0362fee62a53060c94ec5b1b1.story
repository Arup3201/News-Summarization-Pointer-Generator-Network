Tens of thousands of people gathered in Madrid today to witness the beatification of an early leader of Opus Dei, an organisation within the Roman Catholic Church.

At a large outdoor Mass, Cardinal Angelo Amato began the process that will confirm the Blessed Alvaro del Portillo as a saint.

The Blessed Alvaro succeeded Opus Dei's founder, St Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer, as the leader of the organisation.

Opus Dei, once considered a secretive, right-wing, cult-like group that curried high favour within the church, has been trying to foster a friendlier image in recent years.

Dan Brown's best-selling novel, The Da Vinci Code, and subsequent 2006 film portrayed Opus Dei as a murderous, power-hungry sect at the centre of a complex conspiracy to cover up secrets at the heart of the church.

The Blessed Alvaro's journey toward sainthood got under way after Pope Francis confirmed a miracle attributed to his intercession – a requirement to become a saint. A second miracle must be confirmed before the Blessed Alvaro can be canonised.

A Chilean baby boy's heart started beating again in 2003 after hospital staff had failed to resuscitate him for 30 minutes. The boy's parents say they had prayed to the Blessed Alvaro – whom many saw as an affable, approachable man – for his intercession from Heaven.

During the Holy Mass, Cardinal Angelo read out a text in Latin confirming the Blessed Alvaro's beatification.

'We have come from Kenya to be here,' said James Gundiri, a financial analyst from Nairobi. 'He came to Kenya in 1989 and we are very happy, we want to emulate his life and live according to the teachings of the Church.'

'Our whole family has come from Colombia for this beatification,' said lawyer Jorge Gomez, 39. 'For us Catholics, it is like a symbol that helps us live according to the Gospel.'

The Blessed Alvaro's beatification is interpreted by many as a confirmation that Opus Dei has refined its place in the Church

The Blessed Alvaro's beatification is interpreted by many as a confirmation that Opus Dei has refined its place in the Church.

'My general impression is they have gone from being the Darth Vader of the Catholic Church to being another piece of furniture in the living room,' said John Allen, who wrote an authoritative 2005 book on the movement and is currently associate editor of Crux, a news site covering Catholicism.

The Da Vinci Code was a massive shock for Opus Dei, shaking everything up internally including its communications strategy, Allen said.

Dan Brown's character of Silas, a celibate albino Opus Dei monk who practises corporal mortification and who is capable of anything to cover up the idea that Jesus Christ had been a King of Israel whose heirs survived him to this day, seriously dented the movement's reputation.

The practices of self-harm, aggressive recruiting techniques, segregation of sexes in its residential centres and reports by former members that they were forbidden from having contact with family members only added to the perception that Opus Dei was a cult-like institution that nevertheless had the blessing of the papacy.

Rather than call for a boycott or launch defamation lawsuits, Opus Dei seized the opportunity that the publicity generated to open up.

After years of dodging press inquiries and fending off criticisms that it was a cult, Opus Dei launched a global, media-friendly PR 'get to know us' campaign that culminates with the beatification that was open for all to attend.
