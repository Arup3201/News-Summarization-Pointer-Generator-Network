A former professional Grand Prix motorcyclist has been arrested in Dubai just weeks after his wife plunged to her death from a hotel room during their honeymoon.

Abbie Emmett, 27, died just days after she had arrived in the United Arab Emirates with new husband Sean, 43, following their wedding in South Africa.

Mr Emmett is now facing jail after he was accused of smelling of alcohol when he went to sign police papers to organise the release of her body.

Sean Emmett was arrested when police said he smelt of alcohol as he went to a station to organise the release of his wife Abbie's body. She died last month after falling from a hotel window during their honeymoon

He said he had drunk three beers, three sambucas and two brandies the previous night but denied being drunk in public, according to The Sun.

The authorities in Dubai are now pressing charges despite the alcohol being legally bought at the Jumeirah Creekside Hotel.

Father-of-three Mr Emmett told The Sun yesterday: 'There is no way on Earth I would walk into a police station drunk.

'Unfortunately if you have any alcohol in your system it seems to be very black and white here - they just think you're drunk.'

Mr Emmett said he has already spent four days in a prison cell after his arrest on February 28 and is now banned from leaving Dubai until he is brought before a judge on April 30.

He has signed a statement admitting that he drank alcohol without a licence, The Sun reported.

Drinking alcohol in Dubai is illegal without a specific licence.

The Foreign Office said it is providing consular assistance.

The couple had been staying at the luxury Jumeirah Creekside Hotel in Dubai, when Mrs Bennett died

Mrs Emmett, a vicar's daughter, fell from the hotel balcony on February 19.

Reports at the time quoted local police as saying that forensic tests had revealed she had been drinking but they said there were no suspicious circumstances and the case was recorded as a suicide.

The couple shared a flat in Addlestone, Surrey, where Mr Emmett runs a bike taxi service.

Reverend Christopher Elson, the father of Mrs Emmett, said previously that his family were 'shocked and devastated' about her death.

He told 7Days: 'Abbie was loved for her talent and humour by us all.'

Mr Emmett made 50 MotoGP appearances and competed in Grand Prix races for Suzuki between 1993 and 1996.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of the arrest of a British national, Sean Emmett, in Dubai on 28 February.'We are providing consular assistance.'
