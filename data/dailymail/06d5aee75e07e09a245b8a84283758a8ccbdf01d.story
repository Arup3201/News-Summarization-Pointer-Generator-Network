A woman who was filmed drunkenly attacking and killing her neighbours ducks because she was fed up with their quacking escaped with just an order to pay costs and a five-year ban from owning animals.

Charlene Winter, 34, was caught on CCTV stumbling around a garden chasing and attacking the helpless birds.

She had become so enraged with the ducks' quacking she clambered into her neighbour's garden after a heavy drinking session.

A surveillance camera captured her stumbling and lurching before falling over as she tried to attack ducks - and also set her dog on them.

Winter eventually killed one bird by stamping on its neck and letting her pet maul it before wandering out of the garden.

Winter, 34, of Littlehampton, Sussex, admitted two counts of animal cruelty at Worthing Magistrates Court.

A camera set up by the homeowner filmed Winter on September 3 last year, lurching drunkenly around the garden at 8am.

The video captured the horrifying moment she lurched after a duck, stamped down on its neck and allowed her dog to attack it.

A post mortem revealed the bird had died from a compressive trauma from being squashed with a heavy weight.

She was ordered to pay £300 costs and banned from owning animals for five years as punishment for her vile attack.

Animal rights campaigners have slammed the sentence because she could have faced a lifetime ban from owning animals, a £20,000 fine and six months in jail.

RSPCA Inspector Andrew Kirby said: 'This poor duck died after being stood on. It was clearly an intentional and incredibly cruel act.

'Winter showed no regard whatsoever for this duck and was seen standing on her in a deliberate way - crushing the poor bird to death.'

Sue Baumgardt from Brighton Animal Action said: 'Why is she allowed to have animals after five years, why not ban her for life?

'If she is drunk with a dog and then stamping on a duck, is she capable of looking after anything?'
