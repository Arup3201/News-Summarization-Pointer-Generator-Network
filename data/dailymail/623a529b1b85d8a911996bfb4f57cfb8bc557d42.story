A man was fined for parking his motorbike behind yellow lines in front of his house, despite it causing no obstruction to pedestrians.

Alex Bowman, 21, has parked his motorbike in front of his home for four years, after coming to an agreement with neighbours.

But despite his front doorstep sticking out further into the street, a traffic warden slapped a ticket onto the seat of the red Aprilia 125.

Fined: Alex Bowman was given a parking ticket despite keeping his bike behind yellow lines and out of the way of pedestrians and cars

The nursing home worker was about to 
set off for work from his home in Scarborough when he found the ticket, 
and claims he is a victim of 'underhand tactics'.

He said plant pots outside people's 
homes and bin bags waiting for collection on the street caused more of 
an obstruction than his bike.

'I have been riding a bike for four years and this is the first time I have
had a ticket for something like this.,' he said. 'It's not doing any 
harm to anyone. It's parked there so I can keep an eye on it.

'It's ridiculous. There's an alleyway opposite without any double yellows but if I parked it up there it would block people walking up and down, while at the moment it's completely out of the way.

'It's pathetic. I think they use little cases like this to make money. 

'They have just seen this and thought technically it's double yellow lines so let's just give him a ticket. They just don't use their common sense.

'I have spoken to a few neighbours and they think it's ridiculous.'

Narrow: Mr Bowman has agreed with neighbours he will keep his motorbike behind the yellow lines as it keeps the narrow street in Scarborough clear

Mr Bowman has contested the ticket and it is currently being reviewed by Scarborough Council.

'I'm not going to move it for them. That's the only parking available,' he said.

A spokesperson for Scarborough Council's parking team said: 'A yellow line applies from the centre of the carriageway to the property boundary.

'A property boundary relates to the edge of a building, or in the case of a property having a forecourt or garden, to the edge of the forecourt or garden. 

'Areas at the side of roads adjacent to property boundaries that aren't privately owned are automatically adopted highway.

'The yellow lines are sited for safety reasons. It is illegal for a vehicle to wait on a yellow line during the controlled hours, regardless of the length of time involved, unless it is otherwise exempt from the regulations.'
