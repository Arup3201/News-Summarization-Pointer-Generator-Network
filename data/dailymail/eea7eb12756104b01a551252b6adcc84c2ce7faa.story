State agents have seized a polygamous group's Texas ranch where hundreds of children were removed during a 2008 FBI raid prompted by child sex abuse allegations.

The group's leader, Warren Jeffs, is serving life in prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting two girls he took as child brides.

The Texas Department of Public Safety says its agents took possession of the secluded property near Eldorado on Thursday.

In a statement, DPS says authorities were helping the remaining eight adults living on the ranch leave and to do an inventory.

A judge in January ordered the forfeiture of the Yearning For Zion Ranch, which was owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

The state sought to seize the property over allegations of mismanagement by Jeffs.

According to KSBW, the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Schleicher County Sheriff's Office met Wednesday afternoon with two residents of the Yearning for Zion Ranch who told them eight adults are currently living there.

'Law enforcement personnel are working with the occupants of the ranch to take all reasonable actions to assist with their departure of the property, to preserve the property, and to successfully execute the court order,' the state agency said.

The ranch was raided in 2008 after phone calls to a family violence hotline alleged abuse and rape.

Police removed some 468 children from the ranch, and another 130 women left voluntarily.

The children were eventually returned after the Supreme Court rule there was no indication they were in imminent danger.

Created specifically as a center for Warren Jeffs' leadership of Mormon Fundamentalists, the 1,700-acre Yearning for Zion Ranch once had about 700 inhabitants.

Jeffs was convicted in 2011 of sexually assaulting two minors whom he described as his spiritual wives. At trial, prosecutors presented DNA evidence to show he fathered a child with one of those girls, aged 15.

Jeffs, 58, is serving a life prison term in Texas. He has continued to try to lead his roughly 10,000 followers from behind bars. The sect is a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism whose members believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven.

Online records from the Schleicher County Appraisal District indicate a dozen pieces of property at the ranch's address that are owned by the trust and total 1,691 acres. Combined, the most recent appraised value of the properties is $33.4 million.

Jeffs' most devoted followers consider him God's spokesman on earth and a prophet, but they were absent from court for the bulk of his criminal trial.

Paving the way to Jeffs' conviction were his own 'priesthood records' - diary-like volumes, covering tens of thousands of pages, in which Jeffs recounted his sexual encounters and records even his most mundane daily activities.

'This will be a major gathering place of the saints that are driven,' Jeffs wrote of the ranch. 'You can see it is well isolated. In looking at this location, we can raise crops all year round.

There is no building code requirements. We can build as we wish without inspectors coming in.'

Jeffs wanted the 'a rural location where the FLDS could operate a polygamist compound where the systemic sexual assault of children would be tolerated without interference from law enforcement authorities,' according to the affidavit.

The ranch was largely abandoned after Jeffs' conviction and neighbors told Fox 13 that most of the polygamists have moved to other enclaves in South Dakota, Colorado, Arizona and Utah.
