Two engineering bosses have drunk fracking fluid in an attempt to show the world it is safe to use in the ground.

John Gorman, vice-president of Halliburton, and Michael Binnion, chief executive of Questerre Energy Corp, drank samples from champagne bottles.

They urged onlookers to sip the mixture – which is injected into the ground during the fracking process – and 20 other executives did so.

Fracking Fluid: John Gorman, Vice-President of Haliburton Canada, sipped the drink during a PR stunt to prove it is safe

Ironically Halliburton says the 
liquid is not safe for human consumption, but Mr Gorman said that what 
he drank was modified slightly with food additives.

Mr
Binnion told the Quebec Oil and Gas Association conference in Montreal 
that the fluid was ‘very stale-tasting’. But he hoped his drinking it 
would make people reconsider their views on its safety.

The
stunt recalls  that in 1990 when John Gummer, then minister of 
agriculture, tried to persuade his four-year-old daughter to eat a beef 
burger to play down the dangers of BSE – ‘mad cow disease’. She refused.
Thirty-two people later died of CJD, the human form of BSE.

Campaigners
say chemicals mixed with water and sand in the fracking process to 
force gas out of deep rock could contaminate soil and water supplies.

'We were trying to show that whenever the oil and gas industry is shown a challenge, we view it as an opportunity to find solutions,' Gorman told the Financial Post, adding that they replaced 'very few' chemicals with food additives.

Halliburton invented the controversial oil and gas extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking', that allows hydrocarbons to be removed by injecting a chemical fluid into shale rock formations. It is now the biggest provider of services in America’s fracking industry.

But it
has been fighting allegations that the fluids it injects into the 
ground as part of the hydraulic fracturing process are toxic, harmful to the environment and can contaminate human water supply.

So the gas provider developed the CleanStim liquid using 
ingredients 'sourced from the food industry.' Although Halliburton does say the fluid is not for human consumption.

Controversial: Fracking allows hydrocarbons to be removed by injecting a chemical fluid into shale rock formations causing tiny fractures which allow long-term release of gas. But some say the fluids are toxic

'The purpose of drinking frack fluid is to say how one can in a dramatic way show people that their accepted wisdom on frack fluid disclosure is simply wrong,' Mr. Binnion said. 'It is especially wrong today as more and more companies have joined in to disclose contents of the fluids.'

'It was absolutely the first time I drank fracking fluid - you can be 
sure of that,' said Michael Binnion, President of QOGA and CEO of 
Questerre Energy Corp. 'I feel fine.

'There was quite a
build-up, but it was a bit of a let-down as it was less viscous than I 
thought it would be, but more viscous than water. And very 
stale-tasting.'

It comes a month after Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper told a Senate committee that he drank a glass of Halliburton's fracking fluid.

'You can drink it. We did drink it around the table, almost rituallike, in a funny way,' Hickenlooper told the Washington Times. 'It was a demonstration. … they’ve invested millions of dollars in what is a benign fluid in every sense.'

America's biggest: Halliburton invented the controversial oil and gas extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking', and is now America's biggest provider

Invented in 1949, hydraulic fracking involves drilling more than 7,000ft down into gas-bearing shale before pumping a mixture of water and sand at high pressure into the shale, causing tiny fractures which allow long-term release of gas.

In the US large-scale fracking since 2005 has caused energy prices to plummet, sparked economic recovery and cut greenhouse gas emissions to levels last seen in 1990.

However, survey by the Pew Research Center showed the public’s growing anxiety over fracking.

Almost half (49 per cent) of those polled in a recent survey opposed the increased use of fracking — up from 38 per cent people in a similar survey in March — while 44 per cent were in favour.

The skepticism comes as the industry is making concerted efforts to change the ingredients used in fracking fluids and focusing on recycling the water it consumes.

'The oil and gas and oilfield services companies together have not done a good job in the past ten years in defending or proposing solutions,' Mr. Gorman admitted. 'But now obviously it is in our best interest to say, "Look, here are some of the answers to the questions you had". And we think we have done a good job and with data and with facts — not with rhetoric and rumour.'
