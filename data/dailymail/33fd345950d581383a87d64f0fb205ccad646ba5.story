The feet have been revealed to be the least appealing part of the anatomy by neuroscientists studying the links between sex and the brain.

A study conducted jointly by Bangor University and the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg found that feet were the lowest ranked of all 41 body parts in terms of sexual attractiveness, closely followed by kneecaps.

The results, which debunked the commonly held theory that the feet have a sensual connection to the genitals, were published in neuroscientific journalÂ Cortex and a number of newspapers, including the Observer.

Other findings included a male penchant for the backs of the legs (although women were less impressed) and also the hands - another body part that left the female sex drive unmoved.

Men were also revealed to have almost as many erogenous zones as women - a departure from the commonly held perception that they have just one (the genitals).

'A lot of people assume that women's bodies are just full of erogenous zones and that men only have one - the obvious one,' Professor Oliver Turnbull of Bangor University's School of Psychology told the Observer.

FEMALES

A woman's mouth and lips was voted the most erotic body part with the highest rating of 7.9 out of 10.

The nape of neck scored 7.5 out 10.

Nipples and breasts came in joint third with a rating of 7.3.

Bottoms came fourth with 4.5 out of 10.

Hips scored 3.5 and feet received a rating of just one out of 10.

MALES

The mouth and lips received the highest rating of seven out of 10.

A man's inner thigh received a rating of 5.8 out of 10.

The nape of the neck scored 5.6.

Nipples received 4.8 out of 10.

The lower back was rated as the fifth most erotic body part on a man with 2.8 out of 10.

While the least erotic part of a man's body was the forearm with a score of one out of 10.

'But this is clearly not the case. It's pretty equal, with just perhaps a modest advantage to women - but certainly nothing like the way sex differences have been so hugely exaggerated.'

According to scientists, the results, which were collated from questioning 800 people in the UK and South Africa, were also remarkably consistent and held true regardless of race, gender and sexual orientation.

The most popular body part was, inevitably, the genitals, followed by lips, ears, inner thighs, and the shoulder blades.

'We
 have discovered from this that we all share the same erogenous zones in
 at least two very different continents, whether we are a white 
middle-aged woman sitting in a London office or a gay man living in a 
village in Africa,' added Professor Turnbull.

'It suggests it is hardwired, built in, not based on cultural or life experiences.'

Thanks to the findings, scientists now suspect that sexual response is controlled by a different part of the brain to the sense of touch.

Turnbull added: The Cosmopolitan magazines of this world have been running half-baked surveys on this for years and years.

'But we wanted to look at the question of why the side of the neck is interesting if nibbled but not the forehead or the head, which both have the same sensory receptors.

As a result, Turnbull thinks that the sexual response may be controlled by the insula [cortex], although he says that confirming his suspicions could be difficult.

'There are a few ethical issues in trying to take the next step and measure that, as it obviously means that someone has to be stroking someone else whilst the brain is monitored,' he added.

It is highly unlikely, however, that feet will be involved in the process.
