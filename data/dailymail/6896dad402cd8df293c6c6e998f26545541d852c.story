It comes with a villa, four other buildings and even a fish farm - plus you get your very own island thrown in for good measure.

And if that wasn't enough to seal the deal, you will also have Venice on your doorstep.

This stunning property, complete with panoramic views across the city's lagoon, comes with a price tag of €12million (£9.5million).

Serene dream: An island near Venice complete with a villa and fish farm has gone on sale for £9.5million

Breathtaking: The island offers beautiful panoramic views across the lagoon of Venice

For that, you get around 1,660,000 square metres (395 acres) of land, around 380,000 square metres (93 acres) of surrounding water, but also a swamp.

The freehold development, called Venice Island, has gone up for sale on the website Private Islands Online, which says the property is in a 'charming location' near the iconic Italian city.

But the advert suggests elements of the property would need some work.

It says: 'There are four big buildings to be restored. 

'The existing building consists of approximately 2,000 sqm in surface and about 6,000 cubic meters volume to be restored fully.'

Place in the sun: Italy does not have many restrictions regarding foreign ownership, but the site warns buyers to 'use a bilingual lawyer' when making the purchase

The city of Venice and the surrounding lagoon consists of more than 100 islands in a bay with a surface area of around 550 sq km.

Private Islands Online says: 'Imagine exploring the canals of Venice from your own front door... it’s hard not to fall in love with this country.'

Italy does not have many restrictions regarding foreign ownership, but the site warns buyers to 'use a bilingual lawyer' when making the purchase.

It points out that, in Italy, debt remains attached to a property even after the sale, so advises prospective buyers to check the status before going ahead with the sale.
