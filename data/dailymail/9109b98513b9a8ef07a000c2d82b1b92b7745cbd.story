They turned out in their thousands yesterday, dressed to impress in a colourful range of costumes inspired by their favourite comic book characters.

And today revellers at London's Super Comic Book Convention didn't let down, showing off wild headdresses and painted torsos in homage to their fictional counterparts. 

Pausing for a break from the festivities, some were seen lifting out cash and enjoying cups of coffee in full costume. 

Others lived up to their roles, acting out scenes from their favourite books to the delight of friends and fellow enthusiasts.

More than 25,000 people were expected to visit the event in east London's Excel Centre over the weekend. 

The convention, now in its fourth year, is the largest comic book event in the UK.
