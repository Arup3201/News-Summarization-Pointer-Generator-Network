A 92-year-old World War Two veteran has finally earned his wings - 69 years later.

Great-grandfather Ralph Mayville joined an Canadian and U.S. paratrooper unit nicknamed the Black Devils yet never got the chance to jump during the conflict.

He was given the American and Canadian military jump wings, but didn't feel he could wear them on his uniform because he had never performed a jump.

Lifetime ambition: Marv Doney, a 2nd Commando Airborn Regiment veteran, pins jump wings on 92-year-old Ralph Mayville who has completed his first skydive after never getting the chance during World War Two

Sky's no longer the limit: The great-grandfather completes his first skydive nearly 70 years after the war ended. He joined an elite paratrooper unit yet never got the chance to jump during the conflict

Mr Mayville was a member of the elite First Special Service Force nicknamed the Black Devils.

According to the First Special Service Force Living History Group, the unit 'received the most rigorous training schedule (under live fire) ever undertaken by an American Army unit'.

This included 'intense training as paratroopers, ski troops, mountain fighters, demolition experts, amphibious forces and hand-to-hand combat experts.'

The group, which was a joint U.S. and Canadian commando unit, formed in 1942 but disbanded two years later.

But he can finally wear them with pride after completing his first skydive from 14,000ft almost 70 years after the war finished in 1945.

He completed his jump at a skydiving school near Niagara Falls on Saturday.

Ralph, from Windsor in Ontario, Canada, said: 'It's something I always wanted to do. It was fantastic - really beautiful.'

During the jump, his family watched on - with some more nervous than Ralph.

Granddaughter Louanne White said: 'I think he's crazy. He was a little too calm - I was more nervous.'

Well-earned refreshment: Ralph enjoys a beer after his jump which he described as 'fantastic, really beautiful'

Earlier this year, a 93-year-old war veteran completed a skydive after claiming his late wife told him to do something with his life in a dream.

Confined to a wheelchair, Billy Hawes from Tiptree, Essex, had been housebound for four years.

But after a message from his wife in the dream, the widower found a remarkable new lease of life.

After building up the strength to walk again, Mr Hawes flew to South Africa to visit family and celebrated his transformation with an 11,000ft parachute jump.
