Alesha Duncan has a phobia of cats which she says is ruining her life

A mother claims a rare phobia of kittens is ruining her life.

Alesha Duncan, 27, from Waterloo, London, says the sight of a kitten leaves her sobbing with terror and that even a picture of one can trigger a panic attack.

She says her phobia - known as ailurophobia - has ruined relationships and is now threatening friendships, but she is determined to beat it.

Ms Duncan, a fulltime mother to Sapphire, 13 and Luke, two, said: ‘I know most people love little kittens but to me they are just evil. There is nothing cute about them at all.

‘I hate the way they are allowed to just roam around the streets staring at people and hiding. It’s terrifying.

‘I don’t see them as harmless and cute. They are just little monsters. I absolutely hate everything about them.’

She says her phobia is debilitating because the animals are almost impossible to avoid, meaning she is confined to the house is she sees one and refuses to visit anyone who has a kitten as a pet. 

She claims her phobia has already ended one long-term relationship because her former partner had a cat - meaning she was unable to visit.

She said: ‘It was going really well between us but once I found out about the cat, I kept making excuses not to go and see him.

‘I was too embarrassed to admit the real reason so would invent reasons to cancel.

‘I would have invited him to my house but I wasn't ready for him to meet my child, so in the end there was nowhere we could relax together.

‘He couldn’t understand what was wrong with me and when I finally admitted the truth to him the damage was already done. We’d had too many arguments and decided to split.

‘He was sympathetic but people who like cats just cannot understand why I find them so scary.’

Ms Duncan thinks her phobia may have been triggered by an event she witnessed as a child aged eight.

Ms Duncan (pictured with her daughter, Sapphire, and son, Luke) thinks she developed the phobia after seeing her father being attacked by a cat when she was a child

She remembers her father taking her to visit her grandmother who owned a cat.

She said: ‘Dad was playing with the cat like he usually he did and suddenly it just turned and scratched him across the face.

Ailurophobia is a fear of cats which causes undue anxiety.

It occurs even though sufferers know their fear is irrational.

Some sufferers fear a bite or a scratch from a cat.

Others are scared of the 'evil mystique' of the creatures.

Symptoms can include breathlessness, sweating, shaking, heart palpitations and a fear of dying.

The phobia is often triggered by an unpleasant experience involving cats, but some people develop it with no obvious trigger.

Treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy.

‘There was blood dripping down his cheek and dad looked shocked. I was so scared I burst into tears. I never looked at them the same again after that.’

Initially she avoided cats without too much issue, but as she grew older her fear worsened.

She said: ‘I noticed it got much worse after I had my eldest daughter.

'I wouldn’t let her touch cats because I was worried about her getting scratched like my father had.

‘Then as my fear of her getting hurt grew I just started avoiding them all together.’

Ms Duncan would scour the streets from her flat window before daring to leave home to make sure it was free of cats.

If she spotted one she would stay inside until up to an hour after it had gone to make sure the coast was clear.

If she ventured out and saw one she would turn and run the other way.

Now she claims even the sound of a cat screeching at night sets her palms sweating.

She said: ‘My children have grown up 
with this so they understand mummy hates cats.

'I don’t want them to be 
scared of them so I try to play it down if I see one but there’s no way I
 could handle seeing them touch one.

Ms Duncan says that when she goes out her daughter, Sapphire (pictured with her little brother, Luke), has to act as a lookout to make sure there aren't any cats nearby

‘My eldest is so lovely, she knows what a state I get into so she acts as a look out look, warning me if there is a cat ahead so we can go a different way.

‘When we go to the park they’ll have a quick check around for me before we sit down but if one comes along we have to go.’

Now she refuses to date cat owners but says her phobia has also threatened friendships.

Recently one of her closest friends 
needed support after an illness so Ms Duncan agreed to stay for the
 night if the cat was locked away.

But she ended up fleeing in the middle of
 the night when it wandered into the room she was in.

She said: 
‘I wanted to be there for my friend. But I just couldn't handle being in
 the same house as the cat. She needed me and I couldn’t be there for 
her because of this phobia.

‘I felt awful. I haven’t been able to go back since and I hate knowing I am letting her down when she needs me.

Ms Duncan says she is terrified of her children (pictured) being hurt by a cat

Ms Duncan says that before she leaves her flat she has to look out of a window to make sure there are no cats nearby. If she spots one, she will not leave her home for at least an hour to make sure it has gone

‘There are other friends I’ve grown apart from because they have cats. It’s such a shame. My heart sinks when I meet someone new and they tell me they have a cat.

‘I think "why can’t you have a dog"? They are so much nicer. I can’t understand how anyone would want to share their home with something that skulks around and could scratch them at any time.’

But she has so far been unable to seek treatment because she’s terrified it will involve her having to face her fear by holding a cat or kitten.

She said: ‘I just cannot cope with the thought of having to try and touch one so I have avoided it.

‘I’ve tried to discuss it with my GP but I just feel such a fool and I’m worried I won’t be taken seriously. People I have told have usually laughed but it’s not funny to me.

‘I want to beat it because it affects my everyday life so much but the truth is I’m too scared.

‘I hope talking about it now helps others understand how terrifying a phobia can be - even one of cute little kittens.’
