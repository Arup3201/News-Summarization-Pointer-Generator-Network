Chaos: Rising numbers of blood donors are being turned away due to bureaucratic errors

Soaring numbers of blood donors are being turned away without any medical reason - but because of chaos at clinics.

The number of donors being being sent home as a result of an inefficient system has risen by 40 per cent compared with two years ago, which equates to one in 80 patients - or tens of thousands every year.

While 10 per cent of donors are turned away for medical reasons, such as anaemia, recent piercings or infections, a further 10 per cent do not donate because of problems with the running of a clinic.

The figures include people who are told 
that they can no longer be fitted in because of late-running sessions, 
sick staff and other problems, as well as those who have to wait so long
 that they give up and go home, The Times reports.

Long waits to donate mean that many frustrated donors leave before giving blood.

It's estimated that only 4 per cent of people in the UK regularly give blood.

The problem now means that on average, one donor at every donation session is lost to bad management.

Blood donation bosses say part of the reason for growing inefficiencies is because costs have had to be cut to reduce the price of blood to the NHS.

But transplant experts have warned that public faith in the blood donation system will be eroded if the current situation continues.

According to figures from NHS Blood and Transplant, 24,014 people arrived at 
donation sessions last year but could not give blood to due admin or bureaucratic reasons - compared with 19,239 two years earlier.

Jon Latham, assistant director of marketing at the agency, told the newspaper the  very nature of blood donation walk in centres meant that there would sometimes be a wait.

'If you walked in to a doctors’ surgery, then you wouldn’t expect to be seen straight away. But that causes friction,' he said.

'We know people can get frustrated and I really sympathise. [But] I don’t think there’s any other way we can do it. We do all we can to mitigate it but there probably isn’t a better system.'

But James Munro, chief executive of Patient Opinion, said it was 'surprising' that 10 per cent of donors could not do so for non-medical reasons.

he said: 'Blood donation... embodies the relationship we have with the NHS; we all put in and we all benefit. When it goes wrong . . . it undermines that essential public trust.'

He added that if donors don't feel appreciated, they won't turn up.

Defending the situation, NHS Blood and Transplant said the problem may have been over-estimated, with the rejected donor forms being counted incorrectly.
