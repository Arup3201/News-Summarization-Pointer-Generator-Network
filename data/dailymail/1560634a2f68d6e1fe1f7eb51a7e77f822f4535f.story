While his international teammates flew back to England in disgrace after a shambolic World Cup, Arsenal winger Theo Walcott was enjoying a round of golf in the Algarve.

Walcott, who is on holiday in Portugal with his wife Melanie and two-month-old son Finley, looked relaxed as he walked off the final green and to his car.
