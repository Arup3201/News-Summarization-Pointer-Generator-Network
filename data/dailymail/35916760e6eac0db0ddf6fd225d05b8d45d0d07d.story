My five-year-old son Stanley sat beside me in the dentist's waiting room, his little hand clutching mine as he tried his best to be brave. But a few minutes later, I was the one choking back tears as the dentist injected Stanley's mouth with anaesthetic and tugged a rotten molar from his gums.

I was filled with a terrible sense of shame. He wouldn't be suffering if I had taken better care of his teeth.

I'd assumed that regular tooth-brushing and a healthy, low-sugar diet would be enough. To my shock, it wasn't. A combination of lazy brushing and one too many treats was most likely to blame. My only comfort is that I'm not the only parent in this situation.

Stanley had to have one of his teeth removed as he hadn't brushed his teeth properly

The most recent NHS figures reveal that tooth decay in under-fives is a major problem, with more than one million pre-schoolers and reception class pupils having at least two fillings. Each year, 30,000 children end up being admitted to hospital because of rotten teeth.

Many have five or six taken out at once; some their entire set of baby teeth. Perhaps it's hardly surprising, given that 2 per cent of mums say their children don't brush their teeth at all, and 6 per cent of UK children never have dental check-ups.

Dentists call these juvenile patients 'Ribena babies' - children whose teeth have been damaged by soft drinks containing sugar, one of which is Ribena, and other sweet fare. I'd assumed they had ill-educated parents, so was mortified to discover Stan was one of them.

He and his six-year-old brother Frank are banned from fizzy drinks, and have squash, fruit juice or sparkling water. They eat porridge rather than sugary processed cereals. Biscuits, cakes, chocolates and sugary drinks are not allowed in their school playground. 

They have always brushed their teeth twice a day, morning and evening, and I've spent a small fortune on Spider-Man toothbrushes and novelty toothpastes to make the experience fun.

Claire felt dreadful when she had to hold Stanley's hand at the dentist and watch his tooth being removed, knowing she was responsible

Yet when the dentist prodded one of Stanley's bottom teeth, he squealed with pain. There was a hole in his tooth, which would have to be extracted, and he was given antibiotics for a gum infection.

The dentist said I should keep a closer eye on how they brush and how long for. I was also told to ditch the 'fun' toothpastes for one with the same fluoride content advised for adults - 1,350 to 1,500 parts per million.

At home, I sat down and made a note of how many snacks and treats they eat in a week - and  I realised I'd been deluding myself. They were eating a lot of sugar.

As well as natural sugars in apples, bananas and rice cakes, there were after-school pastries, sweets from grandma, boxes of raisins and iced lollies on a trip to the park. And the crumble, custard and flapjacks, which I'd convinced myself were healthy because they were home-made.

To my sons' horror, I've stopped all after-school sweet treats. But when I think of Stanley cowering in the dentist's chair, I know I'm doing what's right for my children.
