A crowd of angry mothers staged a mass-breastfeeding outside an Australian television channel after a male anchor called on mothers to be ‘classy' and 'discreet’ when nursing in public.

Women and children gathered outside the Channel Seven television studios in Sydney to protest against comments made by David Koch, host of Australia's most popular breakfast show Sunrise, on Friday.

About 100 people gathered for the ‘Sunrise Nurse-in’ to defend the legal right to breastfeed in public, demanding an apology from Mr Koch.

Protest: Angry mothers staged a nurse-in protest outside an Australian television channel's studios after a show host said breastfeeding mothers should be more 'classy and discrete'

Mr Koch made the comments on Friday 
morning's show whilst discussing a case where a mother breastfeeding at a
public swimming pool had been told to move to a less public 
area.

He said: ‘I totally agree with 
breastfeeding in public but I think that you have to be a bit classy 
about it that feed on the edge of the pool isn't discreet enough.’

His comments landed him in the hot seat with breastfeeding advocates who staged the protest outside the Sunrise studios.

‘I just feel like their dangerous and offensive,’ protest organiser Amy Ahearn told ABC.

‘They’re dangerous because some women 
find it very difficult to breastfeed, especially in public and I think a
comment like that can shame them into not doing it in public and feel 
like it is not supported by people.'

Tiny turnout: Although 800 had signed up for the protest outside the Sunrise studios, only around 50 attended

Holding her four-month-old daughter Bennie,
the mother-of-two, who was later invited as a guest on Sunrise, urged 
Mr Koch to 'acknowledge' the law which protects mothers from 
breastfeeding in public.

Another woman added: I don't go out 
thinking I'm going to be discreet, or I'm going to be indiscreet, or I'm
going to flop my boob out or whatever people keep saying.

‘I go out and if my baby wants to be fed, I feed him.’

The host, who was named Australia’s  
Father of the Year in 2007, issued an apology on his own show on Monday
morning during but said his position on the matter has not changed.

He maintained that he did not think that women should breastfeed or sunbathe topless in ‘high traffic areas’.

‘When you're at a public swimming pool
and you pull your top down it does show a lot of flesh,’ he told Ms 
Ahearn during a debate. ‘It's important for women to be aware of their 
environment.’

‘I don't mind if women sunbathe 
topless but out of respect for others I hope they would not do it 
between the flags in high traffic areas where families are around.’

Mr Koch, said he was surprised by the venom of the reaction and said the protest was ‘terrific.’

‘They were just 50 lovely ladies with 
their babies who had a different point of view to mine and we had a 
really constructive discussion,’ the presenter said.

‘I've got two daughters, one who's 
torn strips off me saying “I should be able to breastfeed anywhere, any 
way I like”, but I think you've got to be courteous to those people 
around you and be sensitive to their views.’

David Koch is one of the most popular 
television hosts in Australia with his weekday Sunrise show topping the 
ratings for breakfast programmes for the past seven years.

He is affectionately nicknamed ‘Kochie’ and a 2006 Reader’s Digest poll found him the 24th most trusted person in Australia.
