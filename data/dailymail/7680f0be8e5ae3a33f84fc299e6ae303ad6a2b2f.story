New York Yankee's boss Brian Cashman knew about steroid use in the team but turned a blind eye because he had a 'win-at-any-cost' attitude, explosive court papers claim.

The papers were filed yesterday on behalf of Louise Meanwell - who had an affair with Cashman in 2011 and was later accused of stalking and extorting money from him to stay quiet about their relationship.

The British native claims the Yankee's boss told her about steroid use within the team and even named specific players.

The papers also state that Cashman admitted to her during 'pillow talk' that he intentionally misled 
federal investigators during the Roger Clemen's investigation.

Demands: Louise Meanwell filed legal papers in a bid to force Joe Tacopina to drop A-Rod as his client

Allegations: Explosive court papers say that Brian Cashman, right, knew about steroid use in the clubhouse and that A-Rod is a victim of a Yankee 'take down'

'Mr Cashman was ambivalent to the use of performance 
enhancing drugs so long as nothing came back to the Yankee’s 
organization,' the papers state. 'And shared with [Meanwell] his win-at-any-cost attitude.'

Ms Meanwell spent five months in Riker's Island prison after she was 
arraigned on grand larceny, stalking and harassment charges in February
2012 relating to the affair.

Court papers filed on behalf of Ms Meanwell's
mother in January this year accused Cashman of conspiring to have his former lover 
committed so their affair would never be revealed.

Ms Meanwell claims Rodriguez is another victim of a Yankee 'take-down'.

'Mr Rodriguez and his current circumstance is consistent with a New York
Yankee management take-down, as was in the case of [Meanwell],' the papers state.

The motion was filed to force Joe Tacopina into ditching the Yankee's player on the basis his legal firm, Tacopina Seigel & Turano, had a conflict of interest.

Ms Meanwell
is being represented by Stephen 
Turano from the same law offices on a 
separate case in New Jersey, not related to the Cashman affair.

She claims Tacopina did not ask 
her permission when he agreed to represent Rodriguez, who earlier this 
month was handed a 211-match ban after he admitted to using performance 
enhancing drugs.

Ms Meanwell
says she paid Turano $10,000 and gave him 'intimate details' of her 
relationship with Cashman and their conversations - some of which were about steroid use in the Yankees.

Bullish: Joe Tacopina has hit back and accused Ms Meanwell's lawyer of 'not knowing the facts' of his own case

Peter Gleason, who filed the latest 
papers on behalf of Ms Meanwell, said as Cashman’s former lover she 
could be called to the stand in a forthcoming case involving the Yankee's slugger.

Ms Meanwell's court papers claim: 'Prior
to Tacopina, Siegel & Turano PC representing Alex Rodriguez, [Meanwell] was never contacted nor did [she] give informed consent so 
that Tacopina could represent what could be the differing interests [of 
Meanwell and Rodriguez].'

Gleason said: 'You
don’t drop a blue-collar client, who has paid a considerable amount of 
money, for a marquis client coming down the pipe unless you get informed
consent.'

But Tacopina hit back, arguing Ms Meanwell had hired Turano’s separate New Jersey firm, and not the New York-based Tacopina, Seigel & Turano - as her court papers 
claim - to represent her.

Centre stage: Alex 'A-Rod' Rodriguez was banned for 211 matches earlier this month after admitting to taking performance enhancing drugs while he was playing for the Texas Rangers

Tacopina also noted that Ms Meanwell was not 'dropped' as a client by Turano’s New Jersey firm.

He pointed out Turano was still on retainer, adding Gleason 'should not make statements when he does not know the facts of his own case'.

Tacopina said: 'It’s the most ridiculous motion I’ve ever seen. Even if they had gotten the law firm right, there is no conflict of interest.

'I don’t represent Brian Cashman, and I clearly don’t represent the Yankees. Their argument makes no sense.'

But a legal expert told the New York Daily News there does appears to be a conflict of interest, regardless of whether two firms are involved.

'The problem is that the lawyer [could] be less than loyal to one client or the other,' said Monroe Freedman, a professor of law at Hofstra University.
