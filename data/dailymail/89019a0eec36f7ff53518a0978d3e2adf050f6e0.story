The 2014 Honda Odyssey has become the first minivan to be awarded the Top Safety Pick Plus designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety after passing a rigorous new crash test with flying colors.

The Institute, an independent non-profit, named the Odyssey its top pick after the car received a 'Good' rating - the highest possible - in a series of crash tests.

To win the commendation, a vehicle must earn 'Good' ratings in four out of five crash tests and no less than 'Acceptable' in the fifth.

Safest ever: The new Honda 2014 Odyssey minivan displayed at the 2013 New York International Auto Show in March

'Safety is high on the list for parents when it comes to shopping for a family vehicle' Institute President Adrian Lund told CBS.

'Consumers look for models with the highest safety ratings. Honda is ahead of many of its competitors in building state-of-the-art crash-worthiness into its vehicles.'

The crash simulations the minivan was tested for were moderate overlap front, small overlap front, side, rollover, and rear crashes. 

The small overlap front test  measures how well the vehicle would protect its passengers if some, not all, of the front bumper hit another vehicle or vehicle.

Small overlap collisions are some of the most common and most dangerous types of accident, and the Odyssey received a 'Good' rating in the test.

In the test, 25 per cent of a vehicle’s front end on the driver side struck a five-foot rigid barrier traveling at 40 mph. 

'In the Odyssey test, the driver’s space was maintained reasonably well. Injury measures on the dummy indicated a low risk of injury in a crash of this severity,' read a statement from the Institute.

'Because the structure helped keep the steering column stable, the front airbag stayed in front of the driver dummy during the crash to provide good protection. The side curtain airbag deployed and had sufficient forward coverage to protect the head from contact with the side structure and outside objects.'

Although the recommendation is positive for Honda, many other vehicles in the Odyssey's class also received high ratings.

The Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country, and Toyota Sienna have all been named IIHS Top Safety Picks.

According to the LA Times, Honda made some key changes to its 2014 Odyssey including adding 60lbs of additional high-strength steel to help offset the force of a crash.

The car remains the most fuel-efficient in its class, despite the extra weight.

The base model Odyssey costs just less than $30,000, but if you're after a deluxe version, the Touring Elite model costs $45,000 and comes with an integrated vacuum cleaner.
