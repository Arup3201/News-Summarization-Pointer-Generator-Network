Every year on his daughter's birthday, Ian Sullivan visits the grave of the child he lost when a gunman slipped into a Colorado movie theater and fatally shot the six-year-old as she sat with her mother in the fourth row.

And every year, he finds a birthday card on the headstone from the man who was with Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6,  when he couldn't be: the police officer who carried the dying girl out of the theater in his arms.

Since losing his daughter in the 2012 attack, Sullivan withdrew, cutting ties with many of those he had been closest with and retreating to a home in the mountains.

But the 28-year-old found a lifeline in the police officer who shared in his daughter's final moments. The officer he only knows by his first name: Mike.

Lost: Ian Sullivan, 28, lost his daughter, Veronica Moser-Sullivan,6,  in the July 2012 Aurora, Colo. theatre shooting that left 12 dead and 70 injured

Veronica: Veronica was with her mother, Ashley Moser, in the Aurora theatre when shots rang out hitting them both, fatally wounding Veronica and paralyzing Moser

Officer: While grieving the death of his daughter, Sullivan has found a lifeline in the officer who carried his dying daughter out of the theatre, Mike Hawkins (photographed) 

Just after midnight on July 20, 2012, Sullivan fell asleep at his Denver studio apartment, exhausted after returning from one of the long-haul routes he drove as a trucker. Two hours later, he was awakened by his phone.

Sergeant: Hawkins, of the Aurora Police Department has since been promoted to the rank of Sergeant

A relative of his ex-wife, Ashley Moser, told him there had been a shooting at the theater. Veronica was dying.

He arrived too late to say goodbye to his daughter. Her mother was paralyzed in the attack.

Days later, he asked a victim's advocate to introduce him to the police officer who carried Veronica from the theater. 

The officer is Mike Hawkins, who declined to comment to The Associated Press, citing a judge's gag order barring attorneys, authorities or witnesses from talking to the news media about the case.

They met at a police station in Aurora, not far from the theater.

The officer told Sullivan that he, too, was a father. Sullivan said the officer told him that he thought he felt Veronica's heartbeat as he carried her. Sullivan realizes the officer probably felt his own pulse racing.

'The most comforting thing for me was knowing he was a father himself. To know that he picked her up the same way he picks up his own kids and he carried her the same way he carries his own kids,' Sullivan said.

He told the officer the hardest part was feeling powerless and unable to protect his daughter.

'I know it took a lot out of him as well,' he said. 'I could see how much damage it had done to him.'

More than two years later, the officer still checks in on Sullivan with texts on the days that are the hardest — holidays and the birthday, Sullivan said.

Lifeline: Since the fatal shooting, Sullivan has found a lifeline in the police officer who shared in his daughter's final moments  

Divorced: Sullivan (right) and Moser (back right) divorced when Veronica was 3, but Sullivan still saw Veronica regularly and reveled in their time outdoors 

'It's not so much all he was able to tell me, but more so the understanding that I was not alone,' he said. 

Getting the sporadic text messages and seeing the birthday cards reminds him that someone else out there is thinking about his pain.

'It helps,' Sullivan said, 'to understand there's still someone there who actually cares.' 

The young girl Hawkins scooped up that night was born when Sullivan was 19. At the time, he and the girl's mother, Moser, weren't necessarily ready for parenthood, he said.

Withdrew: After the death of his daughter, Sullivan withdrew, cutting ties with many of those he had been closest with and retreating to a home in the mountains 

Change: Veronica was born when Sullivan was 19 years old, and he said having her dramatically changed his life 

But he was proud when he saw his newborn daughter. 'It dramatically changed my life to have her,' he said.

The couple divorced when Veronica was 3, but he still saw her regularly. He reveled in their time outdoors.

On a recent afternoon at his home, Sullivan flipped through photos of her: Veronica on a sandy beach. In a race car. On the first day of kindergarten. She flashes a toothless grin beneath her sandy blonde hair and Hello Kitty earrings.

He pushed a button on a photo frame she gave him a month before her death, and her voice filled the room.

'I love you, Daddy,' she cooed, stumbling over a Father's Day greeting.

To keep Veronica's memory alive, he tries to do the things he used to do with her — hiking, skiing, working on cars. She used to hand him wrenches while he was under the chassis, he said.

He tries to stay busy to keep his mind from wandering into darker thoughts. It doesn't always work.

'I wasn't there to protect her,' he said.

Sullivan's father, Robert Sullivan, said he encourages his son to talk and tries to listen.

'What I notice is a very strong underlying anger and anguish that is going to be very difficult to overcome,' he said. 'It's going to forever alter him.'

Attorneys for the gunman, James Holmes, acknowledge that he killed 12 people and injured 70 others. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Jury selection in his murder trial began Tuesday and is expected to continue for months.
