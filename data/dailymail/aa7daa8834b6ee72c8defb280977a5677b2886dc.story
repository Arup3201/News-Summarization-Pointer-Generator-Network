Two more suspects in the Bali murder of Australian businessman Robert Ellis have been arrested after a violent confrontation with police.

Both men were arrested on Sumba island, in Bali's east and were shot in the leg by officers, Bali police spokesman Hery Wiyanto said.

They had been hiding at a friend's house in West Sumba and fled into the forest when they heard police approach about 3am local time.

Police take evidence from the victim of a Bali homicide, dual Australian and British passport holder Bob Ellis, from Sanglah hospital, Bali. Mr Ellis' body was found in a rice field last month with his throat slashed

'The two of them tried to resist arrest by firing poisonous arrows and using machetes before they were shot at,' he said.

'At 5am this morning, finally the two of them were arrested and at this moment, they're on their way to Bali.'

Police allege the pair, both aged 24, were involved in killing Mr Ellis, 60, in the kitchen of his Sanur villa last month.

His funeral was held in New Zealand on Saturday.

Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids

Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids.

Police allege Ms Noor confessed to organising the crime in anger over marital and money issues.

But Ms Noor's lawyer says although she paid the maid's boyfriend to solve her problems, she never wanted her husband harmed.

Mr Ellis's body was found wrapped in plastic in a rice field, his throat slashed three times.

Two suspects remain at large, both aged 28. However, police believe they know their whereabouts.
