Defence Secretary Philip Hammond wants to expand the reservists

Former servicemen are to be offered cash incentives to join the reservists, the Government will announce today.

Defence 
Secretary Phillip Hammond is proposing the scheme as part of a package of measures intended to improve the reserve forces and place them at the heart of the Armed Forces.

In a speech today, he will set out plans to enable the Territorial Army (TA) - which will be renamed the Army 
Reserve - to play a bigger role in future operations.

With thousands of serving personnel being made redundant through defence cuts, the scheme will enable them to rejoin the Forces in a reservist capacity.

The plans will also allow the 18,000 members of the Armed Forces who voluntarily leave 
their jobs every year to serve again as reserves.

Another proposal is to allow regular personnel to transfer to the reserves on
departure.

Mr Hammond's announcement comes as 30,000 posts are slashed from the regular Armed Forces.

The Army is
losing 20,000 soldiers and will be reduced to 82,000 by 2020.

But the gap will be filled by a newly-expanded reservist force, which will be better integrated with regular troops.

Under the plans, which will be subject to a consultation, the number of training days for reservists 
will increase from 35 to 40 a year. Recruits would expect to serve a six-month tour of duty at 
least once every five months.

To bolster recruitment, they and their employers will be given more notice of 
mobilisations, and companies will be encouraged 
to hire and retain reservists.

It is hoped the plans - to be published in a 
Green Paper - will enable the TA to increase its size from 25,000 official members to 30,000.

Calling for a 'radical shift' in attitudes to the so-called 'weekend warriors', Mr Hammond will say today: 'We're looking for people who are 
going to turn out when they're required to turn out, who are going to do
the training they need to do and who are available for deployment.

'So the message to future reservists 
is clear: promise us you will make the commitment; turn up regularly to 
train and be prepared to deploy. And in return, we promise to equip you,
train you, fund you and use you as an integral part of the British 
Army.'

Mr Hammond will also pledge a 'fresh 
start' in the Government's relationship with reservists, who will in 
future be required to routinely share responsibility for 'activities 
once the exclusive domain of regular forces'.

But shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy 
said more support for non-regular forces was needed.

He said: 'We support action to enhance the role of the reserves, but the 
Government can go further to protect our reservists' patriotism.

'If more is going to be asked of 
reservists, ministers must provide more support. Anti-discrimination 
legislation, improved pre-deployment training and better mental 
healthcare are vital.

'At a difficult time for many companies, employers must be given the support they need when their workers serve on reserve duty.

'Crucially, reserve units must be 
integrated with regular forces rather than form stand alone units and 
civilian skills must be maximised in military contexts."
