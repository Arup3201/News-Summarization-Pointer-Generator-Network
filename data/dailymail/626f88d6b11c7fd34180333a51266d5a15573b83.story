In the ongoing quest for world's best burger, sometimes there's a game changer - and this bacon cheeseburger perched on a Bloody Mary could be it.

The Fully-Loaded, Cheeseburger-Bloody Mary was dreamed up by Dave Sobelman six weeks ago, owner of Sobelman's Pub & Grill in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The drink/burger creation is garnished with shrimp, Polish sausage, cheese, pickled asparagus and sticks of celery - all for just nine dollars. And don't forget the chaser of Sprecher beer.

Dave Sobelman, who started the business with wife Melanie in 1999, told MailOnline today that he originally came up with combination to get people talking on the pub's Facebook page.Â 

Mr Sobleman, who opened his business in 1999, said: 'We are known for our Bloody Marys and so I decided to put a slider on the side.

'It was originally just something for the weekend but then people started showing up during the week asking for them.

'We sold around 80 Bloody Marys with the cheeseburger on Saturday.'

Sobelmans Pub & Grill is a family business - with Mr Sobelman's son Tio, daughter Davia and mother-in-law Lynda all working in the bar. His youngest daughter Daniell is also set to join the family business.

After more than a decade at the helm, Mr Sobleman is an expert in the burger trade and has tweaked the Bloody Mary combination to perfect it.

He added: 'I've stopped putting the 
bacon on it - it was causing the burger to slide down the cocktail 
stick. The best way is to put a slice of cheese on each side of the 
burger which sticks everything together.'

Sobelmans only use burgers made from fresh Angus beef sandwiched between a country butter roll. Many of the garnishes come from the Bay View Packing Company - a pickling business situated right next door.
