Vogue is branching out into the teenage market with the launch of Miss Vogue, aiming itself at the £7billion annual spending power of Britain's 7.5million teenagers.

The 116-page magazine, which is out on Monday, features an £890 handbag in its fashion pages while designer labels DKNY, Coach and Michael by Michael Kors have also placed adverts inside.

The back cover advert is for Dior Addict lip gloss, which costs £21 a tube, and a feature on work experience fashion features clothes totalling more than £1,000.

The first edition of the fashion bible's younger sister stars 20-year-old model Cara Delevingne on its cover, who is praised by Vogue editor-in-chief Alexandra Shulman for her 'maverick sense of style and fun'.

In her editor's letter, Ms Shulman writes: 'Targeted at younger readers specifically, its remit is the same: to inspire even if you're a bit short on cash.'

Designer Henry Holland, 29, and socialite Pixie Geldof, 22, discuss fashion in one piece, Homeland actress Morgan Saylor is interviewed, while 17-year-old American fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson, editor of online magazine Rookie, writes about wearing crowns.

Miss Vogue, which comes free with the June print and iPad issue of its sister publication, follows in the footsteps of Teen Vogue, which launched in the United States in 2003.

Ms Shulman told Women's Wear Daily: 'I admire Teen Vogue and it certainly was an inspiration but I felt Miss Vogue needed a different feeling for the UK; It’s got a more British sensibility, I think, than Teen Vogue.'

The magazine contains 35 pages of adverts, with advertisers stumping up £15,000 for a double page spread and £7,750 for a single page - 60 per cent less than the fee for Vogue itself, reports WWD.

The back cover advert and inside cover pages - occupied by River Island and Topshop - cost an extra 10 per cent.

Other high street advertisers include H&M, Miss Selfridge, Forever 21, and Accessorize.

Miss Vogue was created by the 
existing editorial team behind British Vogue, who are mainly in their 
thirties, the Guardian reports.

It was edited by Ms Shulman's deputy Emily Sheffield, the sister of Samantha Cameron.

Publisher Stephen Quinn told WWD that 300,000 of British Vogue's 1.3million readership were aged between 15 to 24.

'We simply want a percentage of those to buy the magazine at UK newsstands,' he said.

But Miss Vogue, part of the Conde Nast publishing empire, is unlikely to become a monthly magazine in its own right.

'We're doing to it to see if there is the reader and the interest out there,' Ms Shulman told the Guardian.

'We might well sell it twice a year, say, with the main magazine.'
