French fries are unarguably America's favorite side, but a new exhibition makes them the main dish, celebrating the humble fried spud in all its various forms.

Fries from 100 New York restaurants have gone on display at a pop-up space on the Bowery in Downtown Manhattan.

And the examples on display show just how many different forms the fry can take, from the 21 Club’s pommes souffles to the paprika spiced curly fries at hot dog chain Papaya King.  

Now that's a real spud: A new exhibit pays tribute to the French fry with specimens from 100 New York restaurants, such as this spiral creation from Queens eatery Twist and Smash'd

The pièce de résistance is a 'tornado fry,' a spiral creation from Queens burger restaurant Twist and Smash'd. Its creator, Brianna Cano, told MailOnline that the unusual structure was inspired by a dish she tried during a family vacation in Quito, Ecuador.

The exhibit was organized by condiment company Sir Kensington’s to pay tribute to an unsung hero of America's culinary repertoire.

The New York-based firm’s co-founder and CEO, Mark Ramadan, told MailOnline: 'So many chefs all around the city put so much effort and so much work into making the perfect fry, and we didn’t feel like they were getting enough attention.

'Food has gone through an amazing revolution in past few years,' he continued. 'Burgers have gotten better, bread's gotten better, cheese has gotten better, and so have French fries. But no one's really talking about that - the burger gets all the attention.'

In fact, even he was impressed by the level of effort that went into some of the fries on show. 

'There's a restaurant called Colonie and they wrote three paragraphs about how they sent their chef out to a local farm and found this super-unique potato that only they used for their fry, and they fry it three times at very specific temperatures,' he said.

Accoutrements: Wall art illustrating fries from the exhibit hangs above a table of condiments, spices, oils and garnishes 

'Whether it's a cheap fry from Papaya King or a really expensive fry from the East Pole, they care and there's thought that went into this.'

Each fry on display was immediately preserved with an imperceptible layer of resin as it came out of the fryer, and, like a precious artifact, displayed in an individual glass cloche.

In Mr Ramadan's opinion, the most underrated varieties are the waffle fry and curly fry, both of which 'really maximize the surface area of delicious fry.' 

Underrated: Sir Kensington's owners want to show visitors that fries should be as celebrated as burgers and other restaurant items

Unsung heroes: 'So many chefs all around the city put in so much effort and so much work into making the perfect fry, and we didn’t feel like they were getting enough attention,' Sir Kensington's co-founder and CEO Mark Ramadan toldMailOnline

Newfound respect: 'I think if there's one thing people leave this event thinking, it's that fries are incredibly diverse and incredibly unique and chefs think a lot about them,' he added

While he said those were harder to find, the exhibit does include plenty of visually diverse varieties, with waffle fries from Quality Meats and Max Brenner, a curly fry from Papaya King, and a sweet potato fry from Bareburger for viewers to feast their eyes on.

Ultimately, Mr Ramadan wants to show visitors that fries should be as celebrated as burgers, and any other menu item.

'I think if there's one thing people leave this event thinking, it's that fries are incredibly diverse and incredibly unique and chefs think a lot about them.'

Fries of New York is located at 168 Bowery and is open to the public November 7 and 8. For more information, visit fries.sirkensingtons.com.
