A South Korean health and safety worker responsible for a concert at which 16 people plunged to their deaths when a ventilation grid collapsed has been found dead just one day after the tragedy.

The 37-year-old was found dead yesterday morning after reportedly leaping from the roof of a 10-storey building in Seongnam, the city south of Seol, where more than a dozen died on Friday while watching a girl band. 

It is understood the man, named locally as Mr Oh, was questioned by police on Friday after the concert was brought to an abrupt halt.

Around 30 people had climbed onto the ventilation grid in X for a better view of the performance when it collapsed, killing 16 and leaving another 11 with serious injuries.

South Korean Police revealed today the man was found at around 7am on Saturday near to where the tragedy occurred.

It is understood he was questioned by police on Friday before his death which is being treated as a suicide, officials said.

Hundreds had gathered in Pangyo Techno Valley on Friday to watch girl band 4minute as part of a local festival. 

The 37-year-old man is thought to have leapt from a 10-storey building on Saturday morning  

The grill on which the crowds stood covered a shaft that led down to an underground parking area some 33ft below 

Eleven others were seriously hurt with eight people receiving treatment for life-threatening injuries

Dozens of people climbed to the stand on the ventilation grid to gain a better view of the performance when it suddenly gave way to their weight. 

The victims fell 33ft to their deaths, while 11 remain in hospital, eight with life-threatening injuries. 

An eyewitness told YTN news channel: 'There was a sudden, loud screaming, and when I turned it looked as if people were being sucked down into a hole.'
