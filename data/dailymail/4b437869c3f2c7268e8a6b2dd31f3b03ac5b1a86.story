A student was booted off a Southwest Airlines flight during a stopover because he refused to take off a shirt emblazoned with the F-word.

Daniel Podolsky was flying from Dallas to Chicago with the budget carrier after attending the South by Southwest (SxSW) festival in Austin, Texas - and decided to wear a souvenir.

He was dressed in a Comedy Central shirt he was given at the trendy festival, which read BROAD F****** CITY.

Controversial: Daniel Podolsky was thrown off a flight to Chicago for wearing the above Comedy Central shirt, which he was given at the trendy South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas

His quarrel with staff came when bad weather in Chicago forced the plane to pause at Lambert airport in St Louis, Missouri, Fox2 News reported.

Until this point he had been wearing a jacket, but he took it off. When he went to get back on, the gate attendant challenged him.

Podolsky cited his 'freedom of speech', but was told he would be breaching Southwest's rules by wearing an offensive shirt, so couldn't get on.

He refused to back down, and was left behind as the flight soared off to Illinois.

Podolsky then got in touch with Fox to tell them his story, and handed over video footage of the exchange.

He told the station: 'It just happened so fast. Within thirty seconds the flight was gone.'

When asked whether he considered covering up, or taking the shirt off, he replied: 'I mean I would have gladly done so.'

However, his own cell phone video shows him being asked first to change the shirt, then to turn it inside-out, and lastly to do 'anything' not to display the shirt.

Each time he answers 'nope'.

He was later allowed to board a flight to New York, his ultimate destination, after changing his shirt.

A Southwest Airlines spokesman backed up its staff, telling Fox: 'We rely on our Employees and Customers to use common sense and good judgment.'
