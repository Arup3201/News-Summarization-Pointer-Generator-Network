Crowds watched in horror as an escapologist misjudged his act, leaving him dangling upside down by a single burning rope.

Antony Britton was wriggling out of a strait-jacket suspended by burning ropes during a performance in Bradford, West Yorkshire when the accident happened.

The daredevil didn't realise that high winds would speed up the time it took the flames to burn through the ropes, meaning he had to dislocate his shoulder before being lowered to the ground.

Antony Britton was trying to escape from a strait-jacket when high winds meant flames burnt through two of the ropes suspending him faster than expected

Mr Britton was performing at the Escape for Life event earlier this month, which was planned to raise money for a multiple sclerosis charity World Multiple Sclerosis.

He was attempting to escape from a strait-jacket as he hung, suspended upside, from three burning ropes.

But the crowds who had gathered for the event were left shocked when the fire burned through two of the ropes too quickly.

Mr Britton was left suspended by just one rope and was lowered to the ground after dislocating his shoulder.

He said: 'The ropes burned through too quickly. I can usually count on 60 seconds before the first rope burns through, but it was more like 45 seconds, which was too fast.

'The second rope went after 60 seconds and the third would have been another 30 seconds before that burned through.

He added: 'I had to pop my right shoulder 
to get free more quickly and the safety team were all for lowering me 
before I'd got out of the strait jacket, but I was determined I was 
going to do it.'

The stunt is the latest accident Mr Britton has been involved in and he previously burned himself performing a similar trick.

In 2012, a burning rope he was suspended from snapped midway during his show and set his trousers on fire.

Friend Mark Walker said Mr Britton was still happy the event raised money for a good cause and is already planning his next trick.

He said: 'I have known Antony for many years and I always said he had a screw loose, but Escape for Life hits the awareness hard and gets the message across loud and clear.'
