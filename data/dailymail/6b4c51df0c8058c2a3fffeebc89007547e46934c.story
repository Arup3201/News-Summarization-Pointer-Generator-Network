He is already recognised as one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance period.

Now a stunning new exhibition at Buckingham Palace demonstrates how Leonardo da Vinci was also one of the most ground-breaking anatomists of all time.

Indeed his findings dating from the late 1490s and early 1500s were so revolutionary that some could not be conclusively proved until the development of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanners in the 1980s, which use radio waves to take detailed pictures of the body.

Among the 24 sketches never before seen included a detailed study of the right ventricle and valves of the heart

Da Vinci's fascination with the human 
body began through his desire to be 'true to nature' in his paintings 
and led him to embark on what can only be described as a campaign of 
dissection in hospitals and medical schools throughout Florence.

Many of the corpses he worked on were the bodies of executed criminals or those who had no relatives to claim them for burial.

He had hoped to publish his findings 
in a treatise on anatomy and had he done so, his discoveries would have 
transformed European knowledge on the subject.

But on his death in 1519, his notes 
and drawings remained hidden away amongst his mass of private papers and
effectively lost to the world for 400 years.

Arguably his greatest investigations 
focus on the workings of the heart - and the artist came tantalisingly 
close to discovering the science behind the circulation of blood, a 
century before it was officially achieved.

According to Royal Collection curator 
Martin Clayton, da Vinci became fascinated with a swelling he discovered
at the root of the aorta, just beneath the aortic valve.

Leonardo Da Vinci, right, also paid close attention to the abdomen, left, during his extensive analysis of the human anatomy

In order to investigate this he injected melted wax into the heart of an ox in order to make a cast from inside the cavity.

He then made a glass model from the 
cast which he pumped with water containing a suspension of grass seeds 
so that he could witness the 'turbulence' that took place.

From his research he deduced that this
swelling was responsible for the closure of the aortic value after each
beat of the heart - a theory which was not suggested again until 1912 
and even then not conclusively confirmed until less than 30 years ago.

Another ground-breaking discovery came in the winter of 1508-1509 when da Vinci was present at the death of an old man.

He wrote: 'And this old man, a few 
hours before his death, told me that he was over 100 years old, and that
he felt nothing wrong with his body other than weakness... And I 
dissected him to see the cause of so sweet a death.'

Da Vinci then goes on to provide the 
first ever description and diagnosis of coronary vascular occlusion - a 
partial or complete blockage of an artery to the heart - as well as 
arteriosclerosis, or a hardening of the arteries, and cirrhosis of the 
liver.

Other studies concentrate on muscle 
form and the body's reproductive organs, particularly the formation of 
embryos, with astonishingly detailed drawings of babies still inside 
their mother's bodies.

One study illustrating every bone in 
the human body is accompanied by 240 individual drawings of astounding 
clarity and more than 13,000 words of notes - all in his famed 'mirror 
writing'.

There has been much debate as to why 
da Vinci wrote backwards but most seem to think that it was down to a 
combination of him being left handed and dyslexic. Writing in this 
manner enabled his hand to move quickly without smudging the ink.

'To say that Leonardo was a man ahead of his time doesn't even come close to describing his genius,' explained Mr Clayton.

'His drawings are among the finest 
depictions of the human body ever created. Had he published this work, 
he would now be known as one of the greatest scientists in history.'

Professor Peter Abrahams, Professor of
Clinical Anatomy at Warwick Medical School, added: 'For me as an 
anatomist, what Leonardo did was bring all his disciplines of 
architecture, geometry, engineering and combine it with an art 
expression that was quite unique. He put all these things together to 
try and explain not only how things looked but how things worked, and in
that he was certainly unique.

Amongst his studies he also investigated the thoracic and abdominal cavities of an ox, left, and right, the blood supply of a foetal calf

'If you were to take ten specialists 
in the fields of which he worked, geometry, anatomy, physiology, 
engineering and architecture, I doubt if ten professors in those fields 
would have the knowledge base and talents that Leonardo had.'

Da Vinci, who died in 1519, 
bequeathed all his notebooks and drawings to his young assistant, 
Francesco Melzi, who, over the next 50 years, tried to make sense of his
master's daunting legacy.

His son sold on many of the papers to 
the sculptor Pompeo Leoni who mounted the anatomical drawings into a 
large album which eventually made its way to England and is believed to 
have been bought by King Charles II.

It has been in the Royal Collection, which is held in trust by The Queen for the nation, since at least 1690.

The collection boasts the largest 
compendium of Leonardo drawings in the world, some 600 in all, of which 
268 are anatomical sketches. Only one other of his anatomical drawings 
exists elsewhere today.

Of these, 87 are currently on display 
at The Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace - many of which have never 
been publicly seen since they were drawn by the genius himself.
