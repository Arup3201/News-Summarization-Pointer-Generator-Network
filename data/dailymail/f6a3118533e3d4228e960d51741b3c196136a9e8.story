Just one month after being sacked by TV station KFYR for swearing on his live presenting debut, A.J Clemente is back at work - as a barman.

The former news anchor became a viral sensation after he spluttered 'F****** S***' as he attempted to pronounce the name of the London Marathon winner (Tsegaye Kebede) as he began his first broadcast. He was fired 24 hours later.

The TV reporter is now working as a bar tender for $2.23 an hour plus tips at Dewey Beach's The Table and Taproom in Delaware.

Poor introduction: Clemente made the blunder during his first presenting debut on KFYR

Still the star of the bar: A.J Clemente is now working at Dewy Beach's The Table and Taproom in Delaware

Clemente, 24, told rumourfix.com: 'This is what I'm doing for now — I definitely need to make money for bills.'

He added that he would continue to 
work behind the bar throughout the summer before he applies to any more 
TV presenting positions.

Although he lost his job at KFYR, 
Clemente did take advantage of his new found fame after the incident on April 21, telling David 
Letterman on The Late Show that he now prefer to work for ESPN.

Talking about his now infamous first 
appearance on KFYR, ' Clemente told Letterman he ‘crawled in bed’ after 
being told that his slip had been broadcast live.

New found fame: A.J. Clemente told Letterman that he'd jump at the chance to work at sports channel ESPN if they offered him a job after his infamous swearing outburst

Clemente admitted to Letterman that his first reaction after the swearing incident was to crawl into bed and call his parents

‘I went home, crawled in bed and 
called my parents,’ Clemente admitted. ‘But the next day, you gotta pick
yourself up, you gotta laugh at yourself and keep going.’

Clemente proved a figure of fun for Letterman and he had even devoted his Top 10 list to the sacked anchor's plight.

Several more gags were made at Clemente’s expense on the show, but Letterman also offered words of encouragement during their chat and told him 'he would be just fine.'

But when a cocky-sounding Clemente made it clear he was hoping his moment of madness might turn into an offer of a bigger job ideally from ESPN, Letterman told him to forget it.

‘Look, I'm trying to get you the job back in Bismarck, forget about ESPN,’ said Letterman. ‘That ain't gonna happen. You're going back to Bismarck.’

Second chance: A.J. Clemente, from Bismarck, North Dakota, also appeared on the Today Show

Getting by: Clemente did his best to laugh with the NBC anchors over the situation while still calling his gaffe inexcusable and fully expected to be fired like he was

It was a busy couple of days for
Clemente following his blunder as he made appearances on both Live With Kelly and Michael and the Today show.

On Live With Kelly and Michael, the show's control room bleeped Clemente even when he didn’t swear as a joke. Kelly Ripa explained it was a ‘precautionary bleep.’

Still Clemente had the last laugh as the show hired him as celebrity correspondent for a night.

Cohost Michael Strahan told Clemente, ‘One thing about New Yorkers, we believe in giving second chances, man. Yesterday, we called for you. You came here today. (Applause) So, we have a challenge for you if you're willing to accept it. We're going to send you to cover the star-studded red-carpet premiere of Pierce Brosnan's new movie, Love Is All You Need.’

Said Ripa: ‘Now, should you choose to accept this mission, your job is to interview all the celebrities that you can and bring the tape back to us here tomorrow. Are you up for it? What do you think?’

Spotlight: AJ Clemente also appeared on LIVE with Kelly and Michael

Clemente agreed. ‘Yeah,’ he said, adding, ‘yeah, definitely.’

Earlier on the Today show he had revealed that at first he had no idea that his astonishing outburst had been broadcast live on air last Sunday.

'When
I first saw the clip, it was gut-wrenching,' Clemente told the Today show of those two words that first introduced him to Bismarck's evening 
news audience, as well as the rest of America.

'F****** S***,' Clemente is heard just as the camera cut to him hiding his face at the anchor desk.

'I didn't even know I said it on camera until my news director walked in on the third break,' he said.

His co-anchor appeared to stumble over his profanity but he says it was all a situation of the two of them being tossed to from the control room while caught off guard.

Off guard: Clemente told the Today show that he didn't have an ear piece and the control room cut to him and his co-anchor 30 seconds earlier than expected

He says he hadn't yet been given an ear piece by the station and his co-anchor had forgotten hers in her car.

'I was looking down, I was going over my script, Van my co-anchor happens to be looking at the camera and she notices the red light comes on, we actually came on 30 seconds early,' he says.

Then when he saw several names he couldn't pronounce related to the London Marathon winners in his upcoming script, 'fireball shot came right out of my mouth,' he explained.

'I fully expected that they would fire me' he said while calling those two words 'inexcusable.'

'Rookie mistake. I’m a free agent. Can’t
help but laugh at myself and stay positive,' Clemente later wrote on 
Twitter after first being suspended by the station and getting through what he described as a
'tough day.'

Opportunity: Helping him out the anchors allowed Clemente to toss to a commercial break as part of his new anchor reel

‘I want to apologize for an incident 
that occurred prior to our early newscast this evening, when one of our 
employees used profanity on the air,’ Monica Hannan, KFYR-TV wrote in an apology on the station's Facebook page on Sunday.

‘He
did not realize his microphone was on, but still, that's no excuse. We 
train our reporters to always assume that any microphone is live at any 
time. Unfortunately, that was not enough in this case. WE can't take 
back what was said,' she wrote.

At the end of his interview Clemente was given the privilege by NBC’s Matt Lauer of teasing the next segments on Today while throwing to a commercial break.

'Thank God for each day,' Clemente tweeted.
