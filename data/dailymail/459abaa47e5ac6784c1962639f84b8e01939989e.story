A Second World War re-enactment has brought Dad's Army back to life just as hype over the wildly popular TV show's film adaptation begins to build.

The annual Pickering Wartime and 1940s Weekend is running this weekend, with some of its participants bearing an uncanny resemblance to two of the beloved characters from the classic British comedy - Lance-Corporal Jack Jones and Commander Chuck Mainwaring.

Wartime and history enthusiasts dressed as  British, German and U.S. soldiers sent Pickering Showgrounds, in Yorkshire, back in time to celebrate everything 1940s in a surreal recreation of Britain during the Second World War.

The festivities today included an Eastern Front re-enactment, set in Autumn 1942 as the German troops invaded the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa, and a Western Front battle re-enactment - complete with sound effects and pyrotechnics - of the 1944 liberation of Europe.

Although the original Dad's Army TV series featured no women in leading roles, in the new film actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has been lined up to play a glamorous journalist.

The remake will begin shooting this month in Yorkshire and has been picked up by Universal Pictures, which means that it will be distributed worldwide.

Toby Jones – who appeared in The Hunger Games – will play Captain Mainwaring, with Love Actually star Bill Nighy taking on the role of Sergeant Wilson.

Starring alongside them will be Michael Gambon as the frail medic Godfrey, Tom Courtenay as Jones and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison – who will play Private Pike.

The bumbling teenager was originally played by Ian Lavender, who at 68 is the only one of the original cast still left alive. Frank Williams who played the Reverend Timothy Farthing, the vicar of St Aldhelm's Church, joined the programme in the second series and is going strong at 83.

The film will be directed by Oliver Parker, whose previous projects include a remake of St Trinian’s, and produced by Damian Jones, whose credits include The Iron Lady.

Along with the cast list, a few details about the film’s plot have been released, revealing that the remake will be set in 1944 near the end of the Second World War, when morale among the Home Guard is low.

The journalist played by Catherine Zeta-Jones proceeds to set the Home Guard’s pulses racing when she is sent to Walmington-on-Sea to write about their attempts to root out a spy.

A statement detailing the new film's plot outline explains: ‘Their new mission to patrol the Dover army base is a great chance to revive spirits and reputation, that is until glamorous journalist Rose Winters arrives to write about their exploits, putting the local women on red alert.

‘MI5 then discover a radio signal which was sent direct to Berlin from Walmington-on-Sea.

‘There’s a spy on the loose! The outcome of the war is suddenly at stake, and it falls to our unlikely heroes to stand up and be counted.’

Dad’s Army ran from 1968 to 1977 and attracted 18million viewers at its height, with the original cast making their own film in 1971.

So far fans have been skeptical about the remake, with Adam Ward writing on Twitter yesterday: ‘You can’t remake Dad’s Army. Oh please don’t ruin one of our greatest ever comedy shows.’

Paul Oscroft added: ‘Unbelievably great British cast for the new Dad’s Army film – but still dubious about a remake.’

But producer Mr Jones has promised that the film will remain faithful to the spirit of the original show, which is considered a classic of British comedy.

The film will be a comeback for 45-year-old Zeta-Jones, whose career has taken a back seat recently while she sought treatment for bipolar disorder.
