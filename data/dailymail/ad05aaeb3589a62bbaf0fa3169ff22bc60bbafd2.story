Is Cardiff the right move for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set to be confirmed as the new manager of Cardiff City on Thursday afternoon.

He was spotted at the Emirates Stadium before Cardiff's game against Arsenal and in the directors' box watching the 2-0 defeat after flying into London on owner Vincent Tan's private plane.

It is hoped Solskjaer will officially be Malky Mackay's replacement before the FA Cup tie against Newcastle at the weekend.

Sir Alex Ferguson, Solskjaer's former manager at Manchester United, reportedly told him to steer clear of the club and Tan after three months of chaos finally led to the departure of Mackay last Friday.

But Sportsmail understands Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman held further talks with the Molde manager’s representatives and it seems that has convinced him to move to South Wales, despite the former United striker's reservations.

Solskjaer is a patron of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust, who led the stand against Glazer regime.

On the pitch, the 40-year-old has led Molde to the Norwegian title twice, in 2011 and 2012, and to the Norwegian Cup last year.

Dalman has also been authorised by Tan to 
offer a hefty January transfer budget that will extend to ‘whatever it 
takes to secure survival’, according to one source close to Tan.

Reports in Norway say Solskjaer, who has a contract until July has not committed to leaving Molde.

Time's up: Malky Mackay was sacked last Friday after a chaotic last three months in charge at Cardiff

Only one Norwegian has managed in the Premier League and that did not have a happy ending. Egil Olsen took charge of Wimbledon in 1999 but lasted for less than a season as the Dons were relegated from the Premiership (table below is all competitions)

Two more Norwegians have managed in England, although both were in the Championship. Henning Berg was in charge of Blackburn for just 57 days, registering one win, three draws and six defeats in his time there and famously storming out of the club's Christmas party after he was made to go on stage and wear a stocking on his head, and a Michael Jackson wig, and dance on stage.

Stale Solbakken was a disaster at Wolves in the first half of last season, beginning a campaign which was to end in relegation to League One.

The club's CEO 
Tarje Nordstrand Jacobsen told Romsdals Budstikke: 'Ole Gunnar did not 
leave us a message about it one way or the other. He is still our 
manager, at least until the summer.'

He
 would not comment on the information that Solskjaer will be heading to 
England and that he can be presented as new Cardiff boss already.

'It's
 nothing new to say about this situation from the club side. We still 
speak regularly with Ole Gunnar and both parties know well how we have 
each other.'

Former Norway striker Jan Aage 
Fjortoft, now a pundit, tweeted: 'Will try to keep you updated! Can't 
still believe Solskjær is going to Cardiff. Against everything he has 
said/stand for.'

This a staggering volte face if 
Fjortoft is to be believed, as he went on talkSPORT earlier in the week 
and said: 'It won't happen. I understand that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer won't
 pick a club, he will pick a owner so Cardiff won't happen.

'Ole
 Gunnar Solskjaer did an interview some weeks ago and said if he goes to
 England he will be very aware of what owner he's going to work with. 
Based on what I know there's no chance he'll go to Cardiff City.'

Paul Ince and Dan Petrescu have been lined up as insurance options in case Solskjaer turns down the job.

Assistant manager David Kerslake and first-team coach Joe McBride are taking charge of the New Year's Day game at Arsenal.

Until the Norwegian is confirmed, it remains business as usual for Kerslake and McBride.

After the 2-0 defeat by Arsenal on New Year's Day, Kerslake said: 'Although Joe and myself and the rest of the staff know it is only temporary, the last thing I said to the players that they made me feel immensely proud of the performance they put in.

'I am really unsure whether they knew or not (that Solskjaer was at the stadium).

Breaking the deadlock: Nicklas Bendtner netted Arsenal's first of two goals just two minutes before time

'There was no talk of it on the team bus and the hotel and in the dressing-room, so I would not totally unsure about that.'

Kerslake added: 'Whoever comes in, obviously there is an important month coming up, so if he can add to it, make the squad better, then all well and good, but I believe the team are good enough to stay in the Premier League.'

There have been no indications as to whether any of Mackay's former backroom staff would be kept on once a new manager has been appointed.

'No, (I have heard) nothing at all,' said Kerslake.

Taking charge: David Kerslake took charge of Cardiff for their draw with Sunderland and defeat to Arsenal

'I am contracted to the club until the owner or chairman tell me different.

'I will be in work tomorrow as usual.

'Coaches and managers in football know that it's a precarious job and we just get on with it. There is no problem there, it is business as usual.'

PS Malky's back and smiling at Celtic

Malky Mackay, the man Solskjaer seems set to replace at Cardiff, was pictured at Parkhead ahead of Celtic's Scottish Premiership match against Partick Thistle.

Mackay, who played for Celtic, was greeted by Lison Lion Bertie Auld and it seemed to take his mind off the acrimony surrounding his sacking by Vincent Tan.
