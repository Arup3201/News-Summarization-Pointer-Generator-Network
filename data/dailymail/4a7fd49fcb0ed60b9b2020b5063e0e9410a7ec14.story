Grand National-winning rider Ryan Mania will today undergo a precautionary MRI scan following his heavy fall at Hexham but then hopes to be able to leave hospital.

The irony, of course, is that if he had not won Saturday's big race, these words would never have seen the light of day. On Saturday morning, Ryan was just another ambitious jump jockey recognised by only the keenest of racing fans.

The Ryan Mania of 24 hours earlier being airlifted to hospital would hardly have warranted a paragraph in a national newspaper. But after his win on Auroras Encore at Aintree, I watched him walk into the Hexham track flanked by security guards.

There were no gasps of horror - 
watching live, things happen too quickly to get a proper perspective - 
but when Ryan did not get up immediately, eyes remained on him.

Then green protective screens were 
erected to treat him in privacy. When races end, the crowd normally slip
away to bars, tearooms or the paddock. But not when things happen like 
this.

For 25 minutes, Ryan was treated on 
the track and a significant number of concerned spectators did not go 
anywhere, remaining largely silent and concerned.

That silence was broken by the noise 
of the air ambulance but the absence of an announcement meant people on 
the course were searching for information as he was loaded on to the 
aircraft on a spinal board.

It seems people watching on television always get more information than those at the track - which is wrong.

But clerk of the course James 
Armstrong calmed fears, telling me they hoped the situ ation was not as 
serious as it looked. Armstrong said: 'His agent and partner are with 
him. He has had some scans and they are waiting for the results.'

And it was a great relief later to 
see that Ryan himself had Tweeted good news, saying: 'Thanks so much for
all the messages. I'm grand. Staying in hospital to get another scan 
tomorrow then should be home. #highsandlows'

I can remember Mark Pitman, son of 
Jenny, being admitted to hospital following a horror fall less than two 
hours after winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup on his mother's Garrison 
Savannah.

Luckily I never had such a dramatic 
reversal of fortune in such quick succession. But it just illustrates 
the thin line between triumph and disaster that is a jump jockey's 
working life.
