A central Ohio university short on housing says some students will start the school year in temporary, off-campus living quarters with an unusual perk: free access to water slides.

Capital University says Fort Rapids Indoor Water Park and Resort will serve as a temporary dormitory for about 30 students until more rooms become available at the Columbus school.

School spokeswoman Nichole Johnson tells WBNS-TV that Capital had high enrollment and demand for on-campus rooms, causing the student housing squeeze.

Johnson says officials decided the water park hotel was a better solution than adding beds to existing rooms or converting storage spaces into dormitory areas.

The university plans to offer the students a shuttle for the five-mile trip to class from the water park.

A full time member of the college's residential and commuter staff will also live at the water park while the students reside there.

Nichole Johnson, told The Columbus Dispatch: 'We're trying to make it as fun and as safe and engaging for the students as we can while they're there.

'When you look at what your options are, you can either increase the number of beds that you put in each residential space, or you can convert some storage spaces or some student lounges into temporary housing.'

Officials at the university said they expect to see around 50 beds available after two or three weeks into the semester.
