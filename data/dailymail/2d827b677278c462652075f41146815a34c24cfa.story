History makers? Atletico are looking to win the Champions League for the first time in their history on Saturday

The 
forward stepped up his recovery to be fit for Saturday's showpiece by 
training with team-mates on Thursday, before they flew out.

The
 Brazil-born Spain international was thought to be doubtful for 
Saturday's match against Real Madrid due to a nagging right thigh 
injury, but the Vincente Calderon outfit is not giving up.Â 

The
 club sent Costa to Belgrade to seek treatment from Marijana Kovacevic, 
who uses fluid derived from horse placenta to repair damaged cells, 
after he injured himself early in the first-half during their 1-1 draw 
title decider at Barcelona last Saturday.

Costa,
 who has been heavily linked with a summer move to Chelsea, has enjoyed a
 stellar campaign - scoring 36 goals in all competitions for Los 
Rojiblancos.
