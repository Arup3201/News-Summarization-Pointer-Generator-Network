A woman has been killed after her car was rear-ended by a Magical Express bus that was ferrying tourists to Walt Disney World.

The bus slammed into 63-year-old Solange Blain's car at around 3:25 p.m. Friday at Overpass Road just near Epcot theme park. Witnesses said the driver stopped the 1996 Buick in the middle of the road and the bus failed to brake in time, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Blain was taken to Celebration Health in Kissimmee where she was later pronounced dead.

The Magical Express was carrying 36 passengers. Two others were hospitalized with minor injuries.

The bus driver, David Lee Morales, 33, was not hurt and no charges were immediately filed.

Disney's Magical Express is a complimentary shuttle service that transports guests between the airport and the resort. It is operated by Mears Transportation.

Investigators interviewed passengers on the bus and drivers who witnessed the crash.

They will also examine the Buick to determine whether a mechanical failure caused Blain to stop in the road. The speed of the bus may have been a factor, Sgt. Kim Montes, a Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said.

She added that a dip in the road may have prevented the bus driver from seeing the Buick until the last moment.

'He applied his brakes,' Montes said. 'He just couldn't stop.'

One passenger said on Twitter that her children were traumatized by the crash. She told cfnews13.com that she and her family were just arriving at Disney World for a vacation when the crash happened.

She said passengers weren't transported from the wreck site for two hours, but Mears told passengers they were waiting for clearance from FHP to move them off the bus.

'We are saddened by today's tragic accident and offer our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the driver who passed away,' Disney spokeswoman Marilyn Waters said in a statement. 'In addition, we are providing support to the passengers on the bus.'

Mears said it was cooperating fully with the highway patrol.

'Our deepest sympathies go out to the family of the individual who tragically lost their life in this accident,' a spokesman said.
