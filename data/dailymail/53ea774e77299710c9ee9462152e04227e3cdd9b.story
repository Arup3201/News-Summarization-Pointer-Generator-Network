Manchester United have held discussions with Sporting Lisbon about including Nani as a makeweight in their attempt to finally land Argentina defender Marcos Rojo.

After a row between Rojo’s agent and Sporting earlier this week, United are prepared to offload Nani on loan in return and pay most of his wages.

One sticking point of the deal, however, is that 27-year-old winger Nani is reluctant to return to his former club in Portugal.

With the Doyen agency owning 75 per cent of Rojo, Sporting were keen for any potential buyer to meet a release clause of £24million.

United have so far offered £16m but Sporting this week accused Doyen of encouraging interest from the English club and of sending an employee to a meeting with them pretending to be an Old Trafford director.

Rojo, 24, apologised to Sporting’s supporters in an interview on the club’s official television channel on Sunday night for trying to force through the move.

The defender said: 'I was hot-headed and I'm sorry. I'll be back with the rest of the [Sporting] squad tomorrow (Monday).'
