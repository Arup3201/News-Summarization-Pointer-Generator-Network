Injured Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge continued his rehabilitation from a thigh complaint on Monday as the 25-year-old underwent a session in the Boston Red Sox gym.

Sturridge has not featured for Liverpool since August following a series of muscular injuries, the first of which he suffered while on international duty with England.

The former Chelsea man has been training in the United States as he bids to hand manager Brendan Rodgers a fitness boost in the new year.

Sturridge could be back in action by early Janury, claims Reds boss Rodgers

Rodgers revealed last month that the former Chelsea striker has suffered nine separate injuries in his left thigh alone during the course of his career.

But the Liverpool boss delivered some better news on his striker revealing he is closing in on fitness.

Asked when Sturridge would return, Rodgers said: 'That will be just after the Christmas period.'

Sturridge's latest injury was not connected to the one he suffered while on England duty in September

'The first stage of his rehab was in Los Angeles, he's gone to Boston and he will move on to a specialist facility there and hopefully in the early part of the new year he will be back.

'Some point in January we will get him back and that will be really exciting for this team.'
