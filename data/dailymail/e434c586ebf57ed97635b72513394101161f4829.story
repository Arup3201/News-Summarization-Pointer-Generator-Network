What's small, costs $1,685 and looks like Karl Lagerfeld? It's Fendi's limited edition Bag Boy Karlito, of course; the peculiar pom-pom-esque handbag charm with a waiting list of over 600 fashionistas and counting.

The Karlito made its first appearance at the fashion house's Milan fall runway show in February, dangling from the poised fingertips of supermodel Cara Delevingne. Its waiting list officially opened last month, with deliveries scheduled for September, according to WWD.

And animal rights enthusiasts may wish to look away. Designed to resemble the 80-year-old designer's signature monochrome uniform, the Karlito's 'sunglasses' are black mink, his 'torso' is silver fox, and there's a tuft of goat fur sprouting from his 'head' for good measure.

At a steep $1,685 each, the Karlito has already made Fendi over a million dollars.

Miss Delevingne, a firm favorite of Mr Lagerfeld, has had a long-standing affection for trinkets that resemble the iconic designer.

Before the Karlito came into existence, she was regularly spotted carrying round a knitted doll version, which retailed for a much more modest $134.

Fluff galore: The famously outspoken designer has been Fendi's designer of fur since 1965, and once described ethical conversations on the matter as 'childish'

During an interview with Topshop two years ago, Miss Delevingne yanked the knitted doll out of her handbag and said: 'This is what I keep with me every day.

'You can change him, I've got different outfits for him. Karl told me I need to change his outfit every day.' She added that she sometimes braids the doll's wool hair.Â 

Mr Lagerfeld, has been Fendi's designer of fur and ready-to-wear since 1965. Famous for his blunt approach and acid tongue - he's called Pippa Middleton ugly, Adele fat, and Lana del Rey fake - he once said of the animals who end up on his runways that he is simply 'killing those beasts who would kill us if they could' and that 'the discussion of fur is childish.'

Likeness: Before the Karlito, Miss Delevingne carried this knitted doll (pictured) in her handbag with her 'every day,' even changing its outfits and braiding its hair

Designer Stella McCartney, who never uses fur or leather in her collections, once sent Mr Lagerfeld an anti-fur video, later telling animal rights charity PETA that he 'didn't have the balls' to watch it, and had 'rather predictably felt the need to return it.'

PETA spoke to MailOnline about the Karlito, stating: 'Either Karl Lagerfeld is losing his marbles and has forgotten that not so long ago, he was sensibly praising faux fur as a substitute - or his innovative years are behind him.

'There's nothing new or exciting about draping models in the skins of dead animals.'

There is at least one fluffy animal who makes it into Mr Lagerfeld's work without first being dead, however, and that's his beloved Siamese cat, Choupette.

This week, it was revealed that the blue-eyed, white-furred feline will be fronting a new make-up campaign Mr Lagerfeld is heading up with Japanese cosmetics brand Shu Uemura later this year.
