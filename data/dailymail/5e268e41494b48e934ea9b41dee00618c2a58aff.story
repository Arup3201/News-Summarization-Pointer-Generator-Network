George Moore died aged just 10 months old after going on his first foreign holiday to Tunisia with his mother Emma, 24

A baby who fell ill on a flight to his first foreign holiday died hours later from  suspected meningitis.

Ten-month-old George Moore became poorly after arriving in Tunisia with his mother and grandparents.

After appearing hot, lethargic and sleepy on landing, he was seen by the hotel doctor who recommended he go to hospital.

But once there his condition  deteriorated and despite the best efforts of medical staff he went into cardiac arrest and died.

Last night his mother Emma Moore, 24, urged parents to be  vigilant and told how the disease struck with shocking speed.

She said: ‘We couldn’t believe that such a healthy, advanced, happy, little boy could be gone with hardly any warning. You truly wouldn’t believe it unless you had been unfortunate enough to have experienced a similar situation.

‘George was such a happy little boy who was always laughing and giggling. No one expects to go on holiday and come back without their baby.’

The tragedy occurred last month as Mrs Moore, a bank clerk, waited at Manchester Airport with her parents, Chris and Lesley Wignall, to board their plane.

Suddenly George was sick but the family presumed it was down to the change of routine and the fact he had just drunk a whole bottle of milk. He fell asleep on the plane but when he woke he appeared grumpy and soon fell back to sleep again.

Mrs Moore of Penwortham, near Preston, said: ‘Once we arrived in Tunisia I fed George another full bottle and he again seemed tired, grumpy and lethargic which we thought was due to the fact that he’d been woken in the night and was still catching up on sleep.

‘At the hotel I fed George his baby 
food jar which he ate half of before falling asleep again and I began to
think there was something not quite right.

‘I dug out my thermometer and realised
he had a temperature and I ran a cool bath. He was very floppy and 
needed holding up in the bath.’

The hotel doctor was called and he recommended they go to hospital. Within half an hour they were in a children’s ward.

Emma said her son had been sick and grumpy before boarding the flight at 6am, but she put this down to the change in his usual routine and the fact that he had drunk a bottle of milk

Baby George slept through most of the flight and it was only when Emma arrived at the hotel she began to think that something was wrong when she struggled to wake him up

The hotel doctor recommended George be taken to hospital but said it was 'nothing serious'. However, when George arrived his skin became blotchy and he struggled to breathe before dying shortly after

There are two types of meningitis, bacterial and viral. Bacterial is the most dangerous because it can cause septicemia - or blood poisoning, which can be fatal.

Most people know to look out for a rash which doesn't fade when pressed against a glass - but this is a later symptom and doesn't always appear.

In babies and very young children, early warning signs include being floppy or unresponsive, vomiting or refusing food, and being very sleepy and reluctant to wake up.

The child may also develop a staring expression, pale or blotchy skin, and be irritable and not want to be held.

Other symptoms can include having unusually cold hands and feet, blue lips, shivering, and pain in muscles or joints.

If you detect any of the above symptoms with a fever, you are advised to call 999 immediately and request an ambulance.

Later symptoms are drowsiness, confusion, seizures, sensitivity to bright lights, rapid breathing, and a rash.

Viral meningitis can still be serious, but usually has mild flu-like symptoms.

George’s hands, feet and ears were 
turning slightly blue and were very cold even though he had a high 
temperature. He had also developed tiny, blackhead-like spots around his
mouth.

He was placed on a drip and a heart monitor but appeared frustrated and began wriggling and getting tangled in the wires.

Mrs Moore – whose self-employed 
husband, Richard, had stayed at home to work – said: ‘George’s whole 
face had turned a purple  colour and he had developed big red blotches 
all over his head.

‘The nurses immediately began giving 
him oxygen via a mask and told us they needed to take him straight to 
intensive care. When my dad and I went to see George, his whole body was
red with big white blotches.

‘I stayed alone with George for a 
while singing, talking and kissing him before the doctor came to examine
him and told me to leave the room.

'I could hear the machines beeping 
and nurses rushing in and out and they informed me it wasn’t good, that 
he was unstable and they were massaging his heart.

'Within 15 minutes the 
doctor returned to tell us his heart had stopped and he had 
unfortunately passed away. I couldn’t believe it.’

A post-mortem examination was carried 
out in Tunisia and the results are still unavailable, although British 
doctors believe George died of meningococcal septicaemia.

The family flew back to the UK three days later and want to raise awareness about the disease by raising funds for charity.

The family have set up a fund for Meningitis Now in remembrance of George and want to raise as much money as possible to fight the disease.

George was also on holiday with his grandfather Chris Wignall (right). His father, Richard, was unable to come because he is self-employed and struggles to get time off work
