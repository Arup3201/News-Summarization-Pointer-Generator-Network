With her husband still recuperating after his recent abdominal surgery, the Queen had to rely on the company of her faithful canine companions when she arrived in Scotland on holiday today.

Dressed in a pink raincoat and familiar flowered headscarf, the monarch  flew up from London to Aberdeen in a private jet to begin her two-month Highland break at Balmoral Castle.

This year, however, she will spend the first few weeks of her holiday alone as her 92-year-old husband is still recuperating from recent abdominal surgery.

After spending several weeks with his
 wife at Windsor Castle, the 92-year-old has now moved to Sandringham, 
the Queen’s private Norfolk estate, where he continues to recover.

Doctors
 have given him the all-clear to join the monarch but he will make his 
own way up in mid-August, palace sources have revealed.

‘The Duke of Edinburgh plans to join the Queen in Balmoral in August,’ they said.

Although
 the Queen’s 50,000 acre private estate is remote, medics are clearly 
confident that if the doughty duke does feel poorly, he can still be 
swiftly treated.

Indeed,
 last August Philip was admitted to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for 
treatment of his recurring bladder infection after falling ill at the 
royal residence.

Sources also confirmed that he still hoped to resume some ‘light duties’, including public engagements, later in the autumn.

Philip’s
 decision to move to Sandringham alone for the time being, however, 
will, inevitably, spark further fears for his health.

He was admitted to The London Clinic last month – his fourth hospital stay in just 18 months – for an ‘exploratory operation following abdominal investigations’.

A source said at the time: ‘The Duke underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation.

‘He was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly - and without any panic - after a garden party, where appeared in particularly good form.’

He was discharged 10 days later and announced he would take two months off from public duties to recuperate. Buckingham Palace have never revealed the results of his tests, citing medical confidentiality.

Last year the Duke was twice hospitalised with a serious bladder infection during the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and missed a number of key events.

And at Christmas in 2011, he was rushed to hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery while staying at Sandringham. Doctors fitted him with a stent to relieve the problem.

Philip is already the longest-serving consort in British history and the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch.

He has already scaled back on all but his most important patronages but still carries out more than 350 engagements a year, making him one of the hardest-working members of the Royal Family.

At the moment he is the only senior member of the royal family not to have met the latest addition to the royal family, baby Prince George.

Philip enjoys a particularly close relationship with his grandson, Prince William – the pair often shoot together – and it is certain the new parents will want him to meet their son as soon as possible.

Yesterday neither Buckingham or Kensington Palaces could suggest when that might be, however.‘It is a private matter,’ they both said.

But well-placed sources suggest the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge may try to see him in Norfolk before he flies up to Scotland to join his wife.

Last week the Queen revealed that she was desperate for her new great-grandson to arrive before she left to go to Balmoral.

On an engagement in the Lake District, she told schoolgirl Fay Batey: ‘I would very much like it to arrive because I'm going on holiday soon.’

Fortunately he arrived on Monday and she was able to spend 30 minutes with him at Kensington Palace on Wednesday morning.

As always with the Queen, her beloved dogs went with her too - and could be seen being carried off the plane by her servants.

At present the sovereign owns two Corgis: Willow and Holly (who found instant fame when they appeared in last year’s James Bond skit filmed for the opening of the London Olympics) and two Dorgis: Candy and Vulcan.

The palace website say of her pets: ‘The Queen’s corgis travel with her to the various residences, with Her Majesty looking after them herself as much as possible given her busy schedule.’
