It helped the Caped Crusader thwart four of Gotham City's most dangerous villains - now Batman's 'batboat' is going under the hammer.

The fully-working power boat, complete with 'bazooka hatches' and glowing eye-style lights, is expected to fetch up to £42,000 when it appears at auction in Surrey later this month.

Designed for the 1966 film with Adam West in the title role, the vessel also made an appearance in two series of the classic 1960s TV show.

A batboat, built ahead of the 1966 Batman film, is going up for sale  later this month for around £40,000

The boat was made for the 1966 Batman film, featuring Adam West and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin

Boat manufacturers Glastron Industries built two of the brightly coloured crafts and, while one was used for filming, another boat, which is now up for sale, toured the US promoting the film and TV series.

Designers Mel Whitley and Robert Hammond based the boat on a Glastron V-174 but added a red flashing beacon, seats for both Batman and Robin at the front and a deck cover with a glowing Bat sign on the tail fin.

The 17ft 10inch boat has a beam of 74 inches, a top speed of 40mph and seats two - ideal for Batman and his crime-fighting sidekick Robin.

And although the boat is powered by a standard Mer-Cruiser L-6 stern drive, TV executives added a water squirter and a jet nozzle to make it look ‘nuclear-powered’.

Size: Length - 17ft 10in.  Beam - 74in

Speed - 40pmh. Seats - Two

Power - L-6 stern drive. 'Nuclear power' effect made by jet water nozzle

Features - Bazooka hatches, twin wind screens, center console and glowing Bat-Signal on the tail fin

Based on - Glastron V-174 powerboat

Time taken to build - 31 days 

Owner Mark Perkins bought it from the US three years ago and had it restored before shipping it over to the UK where he also owns a replica Batmobile.

He said: 'Although I'm sad to see it go I think it will do really well at auction. It's been a pleasure to have it.

'We recently towed it through London for the Gumball Rally and the looks we get are hilarious. People can't believe what they're seeing.'

Scores of comic and film fans are expected when the boat goes up for sale at the auction house, Historics, on August 30 at Brooklands near Weybridge in Surrey.

The batboat idea first appeared in Detective Comics in April 1946, when it was provided by Scotland Yard to help Batman track down bad-guy Professor Moriarty.

After appearing in the 1966 film and then the TV series, the boat also appeared in the animated series before a more high-tech version was brought in for Batman Returns, starring Michael Keaton. A further-developed craft was used in Batman Forever, starring Val Kilmer.

The boat took 31 days to build and was converted by speedboat manufacturers Glastron Industries

Batman's most famous machine is the Batmobile, which first featured in the Detective Comics in May 1939. Originally a simple red sedan, it later started featuring a prominent bat motif.

After a sleek, open-top red and black Lincoln Futura car (below) was used in the 1966 film and TV series, the car has become much more heavily-armoured in the recent films.

The 'tumbler' version of the car (bottom) featured in the Dark Knight trilogy features automatic cannons, a rocket launcher, a jet engine and converts into a 'Bat-pod' motorbike when damaged.

The 1966 film also featured the Batcopter, which was only slightly modified version of a normal helicopter as it was leased to movie-makers Fox for £500 a day.

One of the aircraft's few features was rope ladder, which Batman climbed down to kick an exploding shark in one scene of the film.

Many forms of Batman have also had a Batcycle, a heavily-armed, high-tech motorbike.

In the comic book universe, the motorcyle is a modified street-bike with a 786cc liquid-cooled V-4 engine. It contains a computer-controlled carburettor and bulletproof wind-guard.

The films have also featured the Batwing, an updated version of the original Batplane, seen in the comics. It is a custom-built air combat vehicle armed with miniguns and missiles.
