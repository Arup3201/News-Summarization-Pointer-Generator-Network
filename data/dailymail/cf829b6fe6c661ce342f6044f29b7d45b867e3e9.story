His list of ‘likes’ covers a broad range of interests – from sunshine to dancing, good food to fitness.

Nowhere, however, does Clinton Baugh admit to a penchant for sleazy late-night clinches with the wives of prominent politicians.

The DJ and professional dancer was yesterday revealed as the man that Sally  Bercow was pictured kissing at a West End nightclub last Saturday.

Named: The man who kissed Speaker's wife Sally Bercow is believed to be DJ and fitness fanatic Craig Oliver, 49

And perhaps worryingly for her 
husband, Commons Speaker John Bercow, Mr Baugh is also on the lookout 
for ‘the love of a good woman’.

Mother
 of three Mrs Bercow, 44, has insisted she is just friends with the  
muscle-bound 49-year-old, who also uses the name Clinton Oliver.

Mr
 Baugh, who also works as a personal trainer and dance instructor, 
describes ‘beautiful girls’ and ‘female fitness models’ as two of his 
likes on his Facebook page, where he has posted pictures of athletes 
posing seductively in skimpy bikinis.

In a separate profile, he describes  himself as a classically trained professional dancer with more than ten years’ experience.

He
 adds: ‘I like warm sunny days, great music, good food, and the love of a
 good woman. I understand the need to dance and the need to dance to 
good music.

‘This has helped me greatly in moving the dancefloor for over 10 years now … Here I am, come and get me.’

The
 astonishing pictures of Mrs Bercow and Mr Baugh kissing  at London’s 
No5 Cavendish Square nightclub last weekend were first published in the 
Sun on Tuesday.

The 
Speaker’s wife was pictured in a brown wig at the party, which was 
hosted by Calum Best – son of late Manchester United  footballer George 
Best – and  The Only Way is Essex star  Chloe Sims.

One
 clubber who witnessed the clinch told the Sun: ‘They were snogging with
 tongues and couldn’t take their hands off each other. It lasted for at 
least two minutes. I wonder if he knew he was kissing the Speaker’s 
wife?

‘You could tell Sally
 was drunk. She appeared unsteady on her feet and her top was stained – 
 so she had obviously had a fair bit to drink.

Ms Bercow attempted to play the photographs down on her Twitter account after they emerged

She said the images of her kissing the unknown man had been incorrectly interpreted by the media

Ms Bercow took to the social network to deny her marriage was in trouble after she kissed another man

Description: Mr Oliver, 49, says online that he is a man who likes to 'live, love and dance'

‘It
 was very intimate. She didn’t seem to care who was watching her. 
Perhaps she thought the wig would disguise her. It is humiliating for 
her husband. I am sure he’ll be upset and appalled.’

Such
 was the potential embarrassment for Mrs Bercow’s husband, that copies 
of the Sun were diplomatically removed from the Commons tea room by the 
time MPs arrived at work on the morning of publication.

But one MP later placed a photocopy of the front page – headlined ‘Out of Order! Order!’ – on each of the tables.

Meanwhile,
 Mrs Bercow launched an extraordinary defence of her behaviour. She 
said: ‘Of course I’m still together [with John], I don’t need to 
apologise to John, I’ve done nothing wrong.

‘My marriage is my business. I couldn’t give a damn what  people think. Let people judge me if they want.

‘I’m still very much with John, I’m sitting here in the flat with John and I did nothing wrong.

‘I went out for a friend’s birthday party. I love my husband, he is the most important man in my life.’

She told the London Evening Standard: ‘The guy in the picture is a friend. End of.

‘I
 can’t wait until John  finishes being Speaker, maybe then the media 
will leave me alone. No marriage is perfect but ours works for us.’

She
 also took to Twitter to claim The Sun took the photographs ‘completely 
out of context’, and she accused the newspaper of ‘shoddy journalism’ by
 failing to contact her before publication.

The Sun said it had repeatedly tried to contact her through her husband’s Westminster office.

With the identity of her ‘friend’ still a mystery, the following day more details of Mrs Bercow’s night out emerged.

Compromising photo: The picture surfaced on the Guido Fawkes blog, showing Sally Bercow straddling a pub sofa and holding a champagne flute

Denial: Mrs Bercow claimed the images of her kissing a man in a nightclub are 'totally misleading'. The Labour party activist has regularly courted publicity in recent years, including appearing in Celebrity Big Brother 2011

Aisha Laine, who was also at the club, said that the kissing was so passionate she assumed they were a couple.

She told the newspaper: ‘I’d no idea who she was until afterwards. I thought she must be in a relationship with the guy.

Outraged: Mrs Bercow claimed the images are 'totally misleading' and denied her marriage was in trouble

‘Someone told me it was Sally out of Big Brother but I didn’t recognise her. She looked a mess.

‘I
 was shocked when I saw The Sun picture and read she was married. You 
don’t expect someone in her position to carry on like that.’

Ms Laine said when she tried to dance with Mr Baugh, Mrs Bercow’s friends made it clear he was  off limits.

The
 newspaper appealed to its readers to help them find the mystery 
smoocher. And yesterday they succeeded as they were able to unmask Mr 
Baugh.

Mrs Bercow and Mr Baugh are not believed to have planned to meet at the club, and bumped into each other by chance.

A friend of Mr Baugh told the Sun: ‘He’s a lovely bloke, although Sally is not the type of girl he would normally go for.

‘He’s
 a great guy, really into his fitness and isn’t a drinker as far  as I 
know.’ If the kissing picture wasn’t embarrassing enough, a  second 
photograph from her night out showed her being grasped around the waist 
as she straddled the arm of a sofa while holding a champagne flute.

Mrs
 Bercow has claimed she only started drinking again in 2012 after a 
decade off alcohol and that, while she likes a few drinks, she is ‘very 
strict’ about how much.

Celebrity haunt: previous guests at the nightclub where Mrs Bercow partied have included Helen Flanagan

‘I 
only started to drink again last year after ten years off it. I  drank 
every day, sometimes up to two bottles of wine, and I was out  of 
control.

‘I don’t drink every day but I know I’m an addictive person so I have to watch it.’

Mr Baugh, who lives in a £600,000 terrace house in Battersea, South West London, did not respond to requests to comment.

Sally Bercow has courted controversy since her husband was elected Speaker – despite insisting she hates publicity.

Months after John Bercow started his high-profile Commons role in 2009, she gave a remarkable interview describing her previous ‘ladette’ behaviour of heavy drinking and casual sex.

She said: ‘I would end up sometimes at a bar and someone would send a drink over, and I’d think, “Why not?” and we’d go home together.’

Her role as the Speaker’s wife was also drawn into question after she posed in nothing but a bedsheet against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament for a magazine photoshoot in 2011.During her time on 2011’s Celebrity Big Brother she also forged an unlikely friendship with My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty.

She later took the Irish traveller and his wife on a tour  of Parliament and Mr Bercow later joined them for a  double date.

Last year, she was forced to pay £15,000 damages to the late Tory grandee Lord McAlpine after wrongly linking him to child abuse allegations on Twitter.

The following month it emerged that she had been selling antiques on eBay from her free home in Parliament.

The furniture was her own, but photographs of it were clearly taken in the grace-and-favour apartments provided for her husband.

In October, she put on an unexpected show for paparazzi when she danced in the street as she emerged from a party.

Flashing her knickers as she clambered into a taxi, she grabbed a friend’s leg, provocatively placed it over her own and made a rude gesture with her middle finger.
