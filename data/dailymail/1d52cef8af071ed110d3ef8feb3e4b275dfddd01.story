Luke Armstrong ran up the massive bill after calling and texting his first love

When Luke Armstrong got his first girlfriend it was understandable that he wanted to spend every possible moment talking to her.

But sadly Luke soon learned that love comes at a price -  £912 to be exact.

The 14-year-old left his mother Julie Muller stunned after running up the staggering amount in his phone bill for just one month.

Ms Muller, who says she has forgiven 
her son, has now called on mobile phone companies to prevent the problem
by creating spending limits.

Luke,
who goes to Oasis Academy in Chadderton, Oldham, Greater Manchester, 
went over his 300-minute allowance last month - increasing his bill from
the usual £28 a month to more than £900.

His mother says phone company O2, who the contract is with, should have registered the usage as 'out of the ordinary'.

Ms Muller, from Moston, also thinks mobile companies should send warnings when the bill gets close to the limit.

She
said: 'Luke got a girlfriend and was using the phone in the middle of 
the night and at lunch times at school to talk to her. It is quite sweet
but when I realised what the bill was I nearly had a heart attack.

'I think it’s shocking that companies like 02 don’t give you a warning when you get close to the allowance.

Luke's mother Julie Muller (pictured) said O2 should have warned him when he was over his monthly limit

'They do it with data usage - like the 
internet - and I just don’t understand why they don’t let you know that 
you are running up a bill.'

Ms Muller said that, in the three years 
that Luke has had his phone, he has only gone over his allowance once, 
and then only by about £10.

Phone giant O2 has asked Ms Muller to pay £168 a month to clear the debt

She added: 'He’s never done anything like this before and has been a really responsible kid.

'Both Luke and I thought there was a warning text or phone call to ensure he didn’t breach his allowances.'

O2 have now asked Ms Muller to pay £168 a month to clear the debt. and have blocked the use of the phone until the bill is paid off.

She said: 'I just can’t believe they have shown so little understanding in this matter.'

A spokesman for O2 said: 'Many parents prefer to provide their children with Pay & Go phones which give them more control over the bills.

'We have a wide range of tariffs to suit different usage levels and customer’s can change these to suit their individual circumstances.'
