A kind stranger waited at a cashpoint for more than an hour to return £70 to a shopper who had accidentally left it behind.  

Now Nanette Lovell, 54, from Helston in Cornwall, wants to thank the man who waited for her in the cold after she left her cash in the machine.

She had just withdrawn her weekly food budget from the machine outside her local Tesco when she became distracted and dashed inside the store without taking her money.

She only realised her mistake over an hour later when she went to pay for her shopping at the till.

Ms Lovell went back outside and was astonished to find the mystery man, who had been queuing behind her at the cashpoint, still standing there with her money.

Ms Lovell, a reflexologist, hurried back inside to pay for her shopping but by the time she left the shop the Good Samaritan had left.

She is now appealing for him to come forward so she can thank him properly and offer him a reward.

She said: 'I went and did my shopping and I really dawdled around the supermarket. I was waiting for my son Felix, who works as a baker there, to finish his shift.

'I went to pay and there was no cash in my pocket and I realised what must have happened.

'I went to customer services in the hope that someone had handed it in - but there was nothing.

'I came outside, trying not to cry, when this man came up to me and said, "have you lost something?"

'I was gobsmacked. He said to me, "I've been waiting out here hoping you'd come out. I did try and follow you but I couldn't find you in the store."'

Ms Lovell said she was so shocked she forgot to ask the man his name, but says he was in his fifties, with short brown hair and brown eyes.

She added: 'I think the fact he waited such a long time was really impressive.

'I think he needs recognition for being such a kind man. 'I'd really like the chance to thank him properly.

'I couldn't have afforded to lose that money.'
