A popular photo-sharing website owned by Facebook has told users it now owns the rights to their pictures.

Instagram will not give any warning or payment before cashing in on the images posted on its site. It means pictures by children as young as 13 could be sold to advertisers.

People whose photos have been taken by Instagram users risk finding their image published without their knowledge.

'Did we mention its free?' Except Instagram's new terms of service makes clear that users grant the company rights over all their photos and personal information uploaded to the site

The new policy will operate from the middle of January under changes to terms and conditions announced yesterday.

Instagram’s 30million global users cannot opt out and must close their accounts to maintain control over their images. The change does not affect users of Facebook, which bought Instagram for £616million in April.

The new terms make clear that users effectively hand over the rights to their pictures and personal information in exchange for ‘free’ access to Instagram.

Its website now reads: ‘You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos ... in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.’

The site also updated its privacy settings to share information about its users with Facebook as well as with other affiliates and advertisers.

Instagram says users must be at least 13 years old to sign up for the service. But the new rules assume that when an underage teenager signs up, a parent or guardian is aware that their child’s image, username and photos might be used in adverts.

The shake-up was described as a ‘disgusting’ and ‘egregious’ breach of privacy yesterday. Nick Pickles, of campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘People thought they were Instagram’s customers, but in reality users are Instagram’s product. It goes to show when respecting people’s data and privacy come into conflict with profit, there’s only ever going to be one winner.’

Instagram said the changes will make it easier to integrate with Facebook.

If
 Instagram's new terms of service are tough for your to swallow, there 
is a quick way to remove yourself from the service - and save all your 
pictures.

First
 you need to download all the pictures you have handed over to the app. 
Wired Gadget Lab recommends using Instaport, which will download your 
entire library in just a few minutes.

Once your photos have been rescued, you can upload them to another photo-sharing service with less invasive terms like Flickr.

Once your photos have been removed, its time to delete your account - but bear in mind that once it's gone, it's gone forever.

Instagram
 will not reactivate delected accounts and you will never again be able 
to sign up to the service with the same user name.

‘This means we can do things like fight spam more effectively, detect system and reliability problems more quickly, and build better features for everyone by understanding how Instagram is used,’ it said.

It came as Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, told a Commons committee that ministers shouldn’t introduce tough laws surrounding the use of data.

‘Our services are free to users but they don’t cost us nothing. We have to pay for it and the way we pay for that is advertising and that involves innovative use of the data people provide to us,’ he said yesterday.

Instagram launched in 2010 and allows users to share on Twitter and Facebook images they have taken with digital devices including iPhones.

The app configures photos to produce a square shape similar to the Polaroid images of the 1970s. There are 11 filters that can produce a ‘retro’ look.

Instagram no longer allows Twitter users to view its photographs in tweets in an effort to drive more people away from the rival social media company to its own website.

Kevin Systrom, CEO of the photo-sharing service, which was snapped up by Facebook earlier this year, said Instagram has turned off support for 'Twitter cards,' signalling a deepening rift between two of the web's biggest brands.

Twitter users started to complain earlier this month in public messages that Instagram photos were not displaying properly on Twitter's website.

Clarifying the situation, Mr Systrom released a statement saying: 'We believe the best experience is for us to link back to where the content lives.'

Instagram started off as a smartphone application-only service but has recently improved its website.

'A handful of months ago, we supported Twitter cards because we had a minimal web presence,' Mr Systrom said, noting that the company has since released new features that allow users to comment about and 'like' photos directly on Instagram's website.

The rivalry between Facebook and Twitter intensified in April when the former outbid Twitter to nab fast-growing Instagram in a cash-and-stock deal valued at the time at $1billion.

Facebook is developing its own in-house equivalent to Snapchat, the controversial photo messaging app that has been accused of promoting 'sexting' among youngsters.

Snapchat allows users to send pictures with a time limit - meaning that they automatically delete themselves after a predetermined time has elapsed.

The messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures, with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online.

However, it has come under fire for promising more privacy than it can guarantee, since it remains possible to take a screengrab of the picture before it self destructs.

Facebook, the world's most popular social network, reportedly plans to launch its own Snapchat-like service in the coming weeks, before the end of the year.

The new app will be standalone and separate from the main Facebook app, bringing the social network's app count up to five.
