There's no doubting 2013 was the year of the selfie but a young designer from Colorado took the craze of taking your own photo one step further.

Kyle Warfield, 23, took a selfie every day of the year, and then turned all 365 photos into a gif, or moving, film-type image.

The result is this astonishing piece of footage, entitled Last Year Of Selfies, which it is almost impossible to tear your eyes away from.

Mr Warfield, a graduate in communication design, says he did it as a commentary about the sort of 'hungry for attention' people who spend hours posing to achieve the perfect selfie.

Mr Warfield, from Arvada, Denver, took his picture each day with his Nikon camera on a tripod and then put used the photoshop programme to move his picture to ensure his eyes were lined up with the previous day's picture.

The resulting gif starts off as you would expect, with picture after picture of him staring expressionless at the camera.

But as the gif unfolds, he spits, tears his t-shirt off, pulls it over his head, turns around 360 degrees, and finally - thanks to yet more computer trickery - appears to 'melt' in front of the camera.

Mr Warfield, a graduate from Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design (RMCAD), said he created the footage as a commentary on people who take photographs of themselves.

He said it was a commentary on, specifically, 'those people that constantly post different photos of themselves but consistently make the same exact gesture in each one.'

The graduate in communication design said his project was a commentary on people who pose for selfies

He added: 'I think this type of person is hungry for attention and requires some kind of validation of themselves by acquiring likes and comments.'

Mr Warfield said: 'There is a selfie-formula for these people. And they take the photos with intentionality, often spending far too long to get the perfect self shot, to accentuate their best features. In doing this, they unconsciously generate a facade of themselves.

'This is not how they look on a regular day, and it is far from authentic. For my project, I tried to do the opposite, and make some of the ugliest faces I could.

Mr Warfield said he wanted to show himself as he is, instead of posing to take the perfect, flattering shot

As the year went on, the designer became more adventurous, turning around and pulling his shirt over his head

'I tried to demonstrate the broad range of expressions my face can conjure, instead of posting a singular image of me at my best.'

Mr Warfield, who says he is single, told fans on reddit that making the gif was hard work.

'Some days I got lucky, with just the right amount of change from one photo to the next, but some days I'd have to reshoot my face over and over to get it right,' he said.

'It took forever to accurately capture the spit part. And where my shirt came down my face....I had to attach a string to my shirt with a safety pin, holding the other end of the string with my hand, and then photoshop out the string.

Changing appearance: In some pictures Mr Warfield is more hirsute, while in others he is cleanly shaven

He said that while people who take selfies want to look their best, he wanted to 'pull the ugliest faces I could'
