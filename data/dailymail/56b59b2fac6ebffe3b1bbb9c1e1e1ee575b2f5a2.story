Incredible journey: Tan Le, CEO of San Francisco bioinformatics firm EMOTIV, started life fleeing squalor in Vietnam for a new life in Australia 

Boarding a tugboat in search of a new life, four-year-old Tan Le's mother was clutching one precious possession: a vial of poison.

In the highly possible circumstance of a pirate boarding the vessel, she would feed it to her two daughters and her mother, before taking it herself.

It was a precaution so many had taken before her as they fled squalor in Vietnam for hope in Australia.

Little did they know, as the family huddled together crashing over the China Sea, that one of the little girls would become one of the science world's most successful CEOs with a home in San Francisco.

Tan Le is the founder and chief executive of EMOTIV, a bioinformatics company that studies the brain and teaches computers to think for themselves.  

It is a world, a life, a career she could not have imagined growing up as an Asian outcast in Footscray, a working-class suburb of Melbourne.

Speaking to family history enthusiasts at the RootsTech conference in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Le described her ascension from life as an immigrant with nothing - and taunts of 'slit-eye'; graffiti screaming 'go home Asian'.

She told the Deseret News her success is thanks to 'humility with daring' - traits she accrued growing up.

The journey, both physical and psychological, that she went through with her mother, grandmother, and younger sister gave her the strength and confidence to push boundaries.

Describing the start of that journey, aboard the boat, she told a Ted conference: 'I don't remember the pirates who came many times, but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours. 

'But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died, the journey's end too much for him, and the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig. No apple has ever tasted the same.'

Struggles: Le said the hardships of immigration helped her to grow resilient to new challenges in life

At just 16, after intense studying, she was accepted to college. Just a couple of years later she was named 'Young Australian Of The Year.' 

To get there she obtained grants and scholarships. It sent her into a parallel world.  

'In one,' she said, 'I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself. In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.'

When she was invited to speak about social activism, Le was more than capable, but petrified. 

'I didn't know the protocols. I didn't know how to use the cutlery. I didn't know how to talk about wine. I didn't know how to talk about anything. I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb.

'I told my mother I couldn't do it. She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat. No had never been an option. "Just do it," she said, "and don't be what you're not."'
