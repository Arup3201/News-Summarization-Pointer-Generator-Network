Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's wife accidentally crashed the family SUV into a $78,000 Porsche belonging to one of her husband's donors.

Rubio, 43, is considering a possible presidential run and the incident took place at a 'Team Marco 2016' summit on Saturday morning, where he was speaking to 300 of his top donors and supporters at the Delano Hotel in South Beach.

His wife of 16 years, Jeanette Dousdebes Rubio, accidentally crashed the family SUV into a parked Porsche as she dropped the senator off at the event.

Page Six reported Mrs Rubio had driven the family's Ford pickup truck to the hotel, but as she drove up the entrance ramp she got too close to a guest's Porsche Panamera and scraped it.

The website reported that damage to both cars was 'minimal' and no one was hurt.

The owner of the Porsche, which retails for around $78,000, is believed to be a Rubio supporter who was attending the event.

Although Rubio hasn't officially declared his candidacy, he  is doing well in opinion polls among Republican voters, particularly women

One of the hotel's valets called the police, who confirmed an incident had taken place and added that the parties declined to file a report. 

Mrs Rubio, 40, a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader, is now a stay-at-home mom to the couple's four children and runs a weekly Bible study group.

Although Rubio hasn't officially declared his candidacy, he has heightened his profile in recent weeks for admonishing the Obama administration over its Cuba policy.

Reports suggest he has leaped to front of the 2016 pack among Republican voters, with a recent poll putting him in second place in the GOP primary, just behind Mitt Romney and level with Jeb Bush.

Rubio polled at 13 percent - just three points behind front-runner Romney.

Among women, he came in first, earning 22 percent of female respondents' support. 

Saturday's event kicked off a week-long campaign effort.

The Senate seat Rubio holds is due for review in 2016, and the Republican politician has said he won't ask Florida voters to re-elect him if he runs for president. He has until May to decide.

Rubio suggested last week that he is still mulling over his options.

But an adviser told ABC, 'he has told us to proceed as if he is running for president.'
