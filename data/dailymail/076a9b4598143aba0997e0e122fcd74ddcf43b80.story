They may all be acclaimed actresses, but Mia Goth, Imogen Poots and Marine Vacth prove their worth as models too.

The trio have been snapped up to front Miu Miu's slick new campaign shot by industry heavyweight, Steven Meisel. 

The moody shoot, captured in what looks like a hostel, is vintage and cinematic in style.

Imogen Poots, who made her first acting appearance in an episode of Casualty and found major fame in 28 Weeks Later, stars in the new Miu Miu campaign 

Miu Miu called on the best in the business to beautify its campaign stars; hair was coiffed to perfection by Guido Palau and make-up was applied by Pat McGrath.

The Italian fashion house, which is part of the Prada family and headed up by Miuccia Prada, has long had a love affair with actresses.

Previous silver screen campaign faces have included Lupita Nyong'o, Elizabeth Olsen and Elle Fanning. 

The three models have been displaying an avid interest in the fashion world since finding fame. 

Mia Goth, a 21-year-old actress who is dating fellow actor Shia LaBeouf, also stars in the sultry new campaign

Marine Vacth, 23, who took over from Kate Moss as the face of YSL perfumes, also features in the campaign

Poots, who made her first acting appearance in an episode of Casualty and had a non-speaking role in V for Vendetta, attended Miu Miu’s SS14 show at Paris Fashion Week. 

The 25-year-old, from London, has seen her acting career go from strength to strength since being cast in 28 Weeks Later. 

She will be starring alongside Dianna Agron and Riley Keough in Bare, in cinemas later this year.

Mia, 21, is half-Canadian, half-British and regularly attends Louis Vuitton events.

She starred alongside boyfriend Shia LaBeouf in last year's Nymphomaniac film.

The Daytime Emmy winner and his  ladylove have been inseparable since meeting on the set.

Last month, Mia spoke candidly about her 'boy crush' in a video for British Vogue.

When the interviewer asked Goth who was the last person she told I love you to, she smiled and stammered: 'To my boyfriend.' 

Meanwhile, Marine, 23, who lives in Paris with her boyfriend and their son, took over from Kate Moss as the face of YSL perfumes and has also worked with Chloé.
