Controversial MP George Galloway is being investigated by police after declaring his constituency an ‘Israel free zone’.

The Respect MP – who has represented Bradford since 2012 – started the row when he spoke to activists at a meeting in Leeds and attacked Israel for the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

Calling on party members to boycott goods from Israel, their services and academics, he said: ‘We have declared Bradford an Israel-free zone…we don’t want any Israeli goods.

‘We don’t want any Israeli services. We don’t want any Israeli academics coming to the university or the college.

‘We don’t even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford, even if any of them had thought of doing so. We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel. And you have to do the same.’

However, just eight days after Mr Galloway’s comments, a Jewish and Israeli group led by Rabbi Shneur Zalman Odze visited Bradford to ‘prove a point’ and claimed they had received a ‘nice reception even from those who weren’t pro-Israel’.

The group wanted to show they would not be intimidated by what they described as Mr Galloway’s ‘extreme, arrogant and discriminatory’ remarks.

Rabbi Odze even took the time to post a Tweet directly to Mr Galloway along with a picture of the visiting group with the words: ‘In Bradford today with my Israeli friends, we got a tremendous reception – how’s your ban going?’

Speaking after the visit Rabbi Odze said: ‘Britain is renowned for being an open, tolerant and fair society, so for Galloway to appoint himself as a spokesman for the city in such demeaning and dismissive tones is unacceptable.’

He also dubbed Mr Galloway’s Leeds outburst as a ‘hate speech’.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘We have received two separate complaints about comments attributed to George Galloway MP during a speech he gave at a public meeting in Leeds on August 2. We are currently investigating the complaints.’

George Galloway has been involved in numerous anti-Israeli comments in the past. During a July 2006 demonstration he stated: ‘Hezbollah has never been a terrorist organisation.’

In 2009 he received a Palestinian passport from a senior Hamas official.

In the same year Mr Galloway also helped arrange a series of aid convoys to Palestine after helping to raise more than a million pounds to pay for humanitarian aid.

In November 2012, during an anti-Israeli demonstration in his Bradford constituency, he told those present: ‘We do not hate Jews.

'We hate Zionism, we hate Israel, we hate murder and injustice. Israel blasphemes against the Torah (books of Jewish scriptures) by calling itself a Jewish state.'

He later also called for the outlawing of British-Israeli citizenship.

In February 2013 Mr Galloway walked out of a debate at Oxford’s Christ Church College when he discovered his opponent was an Israeli, declaring: ‘I don’t recognise Israel and I don’t debate with Israelis.’
