Barbara Davis, 61, was arrested on charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, violating a restraining order, and mayhem

A Massachusetts woman was arrested during the  blizzard that walloped New England after she attacked her neighbor with a snowblower.

Barbara Davis, 61, was arrested on charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, violating a restraining order, and mayhem, according to police.

She is alleged to have lost her temper and attacked her neighbor at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday as the snow fell heavily throughout parts of New England.

Police were called to a home in Boston's upscale suburb of Arlington to find a 60-year-old woman, who has not been identified, suffering from lacerations to her foot. 

The neighbors had, allegedly, been embroiled in a long-standing dispute, but the victim was not seriously injured.

Arlington Police Chief Fred Ryan said: 'Emotions may run high during a historic weather event like the blizzard we just endured, but that is no excuse for violence.' 

'We are supposed to come together as a community during events like this, and I am very disappointed with these allegations.' 

Anderson was held on $35,000 bail and is expected to be arraigned tomorrow. 

Suffolk County courts remain closed today after the massive storm that left Boston digging out from more than two feet of snow that fell Monday into Tuesday. 

However, roads in and around Boston have begun to re-open and public transit was back up and running this morning.

The blizzard dumped 26 inches of snow on Boston and 31 inches on South Boston. It was the sixth-largest snowstorm on record in the city's history and the largest ever in January.
