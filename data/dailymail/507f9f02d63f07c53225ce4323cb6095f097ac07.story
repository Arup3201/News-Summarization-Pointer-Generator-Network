Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc has joked that Jose Mourinho is a 'genius' for getting Chelsea knocked out of the FA Cup.

Chelsea's shock 4-2 defeat against League One Bradford last month now means Mourinho and his side have a free weekend to prepare for the Champions League last 16 clash against PSG next Tuesday.   

Meanwhile, Blanc's side face a Ligue 1 clash against Caen on Sunday afternoon and will have just one full day to recover before the first leg clash at the Parc des Princes.

Blanc told Le 10 Sport: 'Jose Mourinho is a genius. He lost his cup match 4-2 (against Bradford) and he has given himself a week to prepare for his match against us in the Champions League. 

'I can only imagine the tsunami and the turbulence that we would have had here if we had lost the same kind of match.

'It would have been said that the PSG coach did not understand anything. He is very strong, Jose.'

Speaking after the Bradford defeat, Mourinho, whose side had surrendered a 2-0 lead at Stamford Bridge, admitted he was 'embarrassed' by the result.   

He said: 'Frustration is not the right word, embarrassed would be more appropriate.

'I repeat the words from my press conference that in case we lose, it’s a disgrace.

'It’s a sports disgrace ­obviously, but it’s a disgrace. In this competition this happens to every team now and again.'
