Factories and businesses will be paid to turn out their lights between 4pm and 8pm under emergency measures designed to head off the threat of blackouts next winter.

They will be asked to save energy by halting production during the peak period for households if high demand caused by unusually harsh weather puts families at risk of being plunged into darkness.

Industry watchdog Ofgem has decided the plan is necessary to ensure an adequate supply of electricity and prevent the lights going out in homes.

But the cost of running the scheme, if it needs to be implemented, is bound to fall on the shoulders of consumers through their bills.

The measures would also inevitably affect the nation’s productivity, thereby harming the economic recovery.

They are needed because many coal and gas-fired power stations are being closed or mothballed to meet government promises to cut carbon emissions. 

At the same time, not enough wind turbines are being built to cover the resulting fall in Britain’s electricity-generating capacity.

Hundreds of firms could sign up to the scheme, with the National Grid giving them a total of around £10million for agreeing to take part.

The bill could double or treble if the requirement to cut energy use is triggered.

The system of payments will only kick in if winters are particularly harsh and demand from households rises as a result.

Factories would cease production between 4pm and 8pm, when demand peaks as millions of children and workers return home.

The Energy Intensive Users Group, which speaks for heavy industry, said there is a real risk of power shortages next winter and even more so for 2015-16.

'How are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having Third World levels of reliability for power?'

Its director, Jeremy Nicholson, said: ‘These are, in effect, emergency measures to deal with the possibility of electricity shortages until new supply comes on line.’

He said that the scheme was a necessary response to the situation, but added: ‘This can’t be a sustainable way of managing the energy system. We should not be in this situation.

'Ofgem has been warning governments about the threat to supply margins for many years. But the changes to the energy market, such as the building of new nuclear power stations, is coming too late.’

Speaking of the economic impact,  he asked: ‘How are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having Third World levels of reliability for power?’

Ofgem chief executive Andrew Wright said it was prudent to develop new measures as insurance against blackouts, adding: ‘There can be no room for industry complacency on security of supply.’
