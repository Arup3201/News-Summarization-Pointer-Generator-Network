Boris Becker was seen having a knock up at the U.S. Open practice court with an extraordinary case of what appeared to be tennis elbow.

The former tennis player, who won the Slam himself in 1989, is at the tournament as world number one Novak Djokovic's coach.

But it seems the former German star, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, needs to put his racquet down and give his arm a rest.

The large bump did not stop the former world number one from going for a knock-up on a practice court

Ouch: The lump looks sore but Becker, who is Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic's coach, carries on

The 46-year-old former world number one was only named as the Serbian's coach last year but the huge lump on his elbow may be a sign he needs a rest.

Surprisingly the lump is on his left arm, suggesting the injury may not be tennis-related as he is a right-handed player. 

However Becker will have to go careful on the double-handed backhands for the time being, especially when facing this year's Wimbledon champion, Djokovic. 

Fans spotted the lump on Becker's left elbow was he watched the Serbian breeze past Argentine player Diego Schwartzman 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 today. 

Is that a grimace? Becker's injury may not be tennis-related as it is on his left hand and he is a right-hander

But more pictures of the uncomfortable-looking bump appeared later on as photographers watched Becker having a knock-up at the Arthur Ashe stadium court at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York.

Djokovic, who said he enjoyed playing in the late evening slot at the Open, next plays Paul-Henri Mathieu.

Djokovic and Murray are on course to face each other in the quarter finals should they both reach that stage.

Murray laboured to beat Dutchman Robin Haase yesterday over four sets.

It is not all work for Becker, however. 

He was seen relaxing in the Flushing district of Queens, New York yesterday with his wife Lilly.

The couple were seen laughing and kissing as Mrs Becker sipped on a glass of wine.

Tennis elbow is a condition that causes pain and inflammation around the outside of the elbow.

It is caused by the overuse of the muscles of the forearm and lasts between six months and two years.
