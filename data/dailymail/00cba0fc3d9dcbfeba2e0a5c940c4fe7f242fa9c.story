Gerard Depardieu has delivered a withering verdict on his homeland.

'France is sad and I think the French are fed up,' the star declared. He said the problem is 'especially the lack of energy'.

The Government, he added, 'doesn’t know how to do its job' as President Francois Hollande has 'never held a ministerial post'.

Withering attack: Gerard Depardieu said 'France is sad' and the French are fed up under President Hollande

The 63-year-old actor's broadside came during a TV interview in Belgium, where he resides.

Many of France’s wealthiest figures have decamped across the border to avoid the threat of a 75 per cent tax rate.

But Depardieu, who last year accepted Russian citizenship from Vladimir Putin, said it was 'not quite true' he moved to Belgium for tax reasons.

Referring to the central in-the-sticks region, where President Hollande made his early political career, the film star told Notele: 'He just had the Correze, which is in deficit.'

Depardieu sparked bemused annoyance from the French and anger from politicians when he accepted President Putin's offer late last year in a move that was widely perceived to be a refusal to pay taxes.

Sporting a two-headed eagle brooch -- a symbol of Russia -- and framed by a large ham drying in the background, a relaxed Depardieu spoke from the Belgian village of Nechin, near the French border, where he has set up home.

'It was not quite true,' he said of the claim he left France over a tax row, adding that he already paid '50 percent' tax in Belgium. He was not in Belgium 'to make money', he said.

Not only is Nechin only 125 miles from Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, he explained, but having friends in the village and the high quality of the local meat were also factors that tempted him away from France, he said.

But he nonetheless judged Hollande’s fiscal policy to be 'a bit over the top'.

French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, both of whom were highly critical of Depardieu’s flight abroad, also received a verbal swipe from the actor.

'You can’t criticise someone who pays 87 percent tax,' said the star of Cyrano de Bergerac and Green Card.

Depardieu has said that he paid 85 percent tax on his revenues in 2012 and that over 45 years of working and running businesses in France he had paid 145 million euros to state coffers.

In the interview he also revealed his plans to buy a restaurant near Nechin and, on the film side of things, said he had projects in both the United States and, of course, Russia.
