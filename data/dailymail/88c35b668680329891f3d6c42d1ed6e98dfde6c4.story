An 8-year-old boy got a Nintendo DSi for Christmas from Walmart along with an unsavory surprise---pornographic photos saved on the 'new' gaming device.

Tom Mayhew of East Hampton, New York told wavy.com that the family discovered the images on Christmas Day during a family party with several innocent children in attendance.

'He went to play his games, not knowing anything was on it,' Mayhew said.

'After a while, [the kids] took pictures of themselves and when the picture was taken it went to a file,' continued the boy's father.

Tom Mayhew's 8-year-old son was shocked to discover pornographic photos on his new Christmas present

Upon opening the file, the children opened and saw over a dozen pornographic images. The children were shocked and utterly confused by the images depicting acts they'd never even had 'the talk' about.

'It was a shocker because we had family here, and there were a lot of kids here,' said Mayhew.

'The kids were the ones that discovered those pictures.'

Mayhew has been trying to come up with an answer as to how pornographic photos somehow ended up on his son's Christmas present.

At first he thought Nintendo was to blame but after some investigation, Mayhew came to the conclusion that he may have bought a used product that has been returned.

'There is no reason for them to be even really on there,' Mayhew said. 'It's disgusting for one. It seems that this was the only thing left on it.'

The dates on the wuestiobale photos were from earlier in December. There was also a parental control setting account that already had a log-in and password.

WAVY reports that Mayhew bought the game at the Walmart on Cunningham Drive on on December 23.

Tom Mayhew thinks he may have accidentally purchased a used DSi that was marketed as new

Walmart sold Mayhew the product and gave him the impressions the product was brand new

'It was possibly a bought item at one time and returned,' said Mayhew.

'Those things were not deleted from it, so it wasn't a new product. It was a used product.'

The Huffington Post reports that the DSi has internet access and players can browse the web as well as play virtual games. It comes with cameras and can store downloaded materials from the web or elsewhere.

The Huffington Post also reports that this isn't the first time a child has accidentally gotten porn as a gift.

Last year, a Colorado father bought his son a Nintendo 3DS for christmas for hos five year old that had 9 pornographic photos on it.

In 2012, a 9-year-old girl from Sacramento, California found pornographic videos on her new Android tablet. CBS13 reported that the Android came from Target who advised the mother to return the gift.

The Mail Online tried contacting Walmart's corporate office but no one was available for comment.
