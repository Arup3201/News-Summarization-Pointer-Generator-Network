Police were called after a boy of just ten took a knife into a junior school and produced it in front of other children.

The youngster had the Swiss army blade on him at Abbotswood Junior School in Totton, Hants - on the edge of the New Forest, which officers said was visible to fellow pupils.

There are claims the knife was also used to threaten another child.

Concerned parents have since spoken out in anger at the incident while others have decided to keep their children away from Abbotswood altogether.

Police are investigating after the ten year-old carried a Swiss army knife into Abbotswood Junior School (pictured) in Totton, Hants

One mother who did not want to be named, said: 'A pupil threatened another pupil with a knife in the school grounds.

'A few parents are worried and have not sent their children to school today.

'We all think parents should be made aware of this via a letter but they are keeping it quiet.

'What was this child doing with a knife, even taking it to school? Our children need to be made aware of the dangers of weapons.'

Hampshire Constabulary are refusing to discuss further claims one of the children was threatened with the blade but parents remain worried for their children's safety.

Another 'horrified' mother said the boy had not returned to school since the incident, which occurred before lessons started.

Totton town and district councillor Di Brook, a former chairman of governors at the school, said: 'It's horrific that something like this can happen at a junior school.

'You hear about inner city secondary schools being equipped with metal scanners but someone of this age carrying a knife is very worrying.'

Officers said the knife was 'visible' to fellow children which has led to parents voicing their anger and dismay (picture posed by models)

Totton county councillor David Harrison added: 'This sounds like a very serious and unusual incident.

'It's something that should never happen anywhere, let alone in a school environment.'

Head teacher Glenn Moore issued a brief statement but made no mention of the incident.

It said: 'The safety of children in our school is of the utmost importance and we take every step possible to ensure they are secure and well cared for.

'While we are not able to discuss individual cases when incidents occur on school premises they are thoroughly investigated and dealt with appropriately.

It is illegal to carry a knife over 3 inches long (7.62 cm) in public without good reason

While a Swiss Army knife would not typically exceed 3 inches in length, it is also illegal to use any knife in a threatening way

Certain types of blades, including switch or butterfly knives, disguised knives or samurai swords, are completely banned and should not be carried, bought or sold 

It is also an offence to sell a knife of any kind to anyone under 18

The maximum penalty for an adult carrying a knife is 4 years in prison and a fine of £5,000

'With teachers and support staff working to very clear and comprehensive guidance that includes child protection, anti-bullying and positive behaviour policies the school is able to respond quickly and take appropriate action when required.'

A police spokesman said that a ten-year-old boy 'had been spoken to' after taking a Swiss army knife to school.

Councillor Peter Edgar, Hampshire County Council's executive member for education, said: 'Any incident which potentially compromises the safety of a child is taken extremely seriously.

'Follow-up action is taken immediately to ensure firstly that children are safe, and secondly that if appropriate, any wider ramifications are discussed with the wider school population.'

Abbotswood, which has a little over 600 pupils, is a foundation junior school for seven to 11 year olds.

The school displays a proud statement from school inspectors Ofsted on its homepage, who write pupils 'enjoy coming to school and behave well'.

It reads: 'The outstanding care, guidance and support, along with the exciting opportunities provided by the improved curriculum, are motivating, engaging and having a significant impact on the well-being of all pupils.

'As a result, they enjoy coming to school and behave well.'
