A hapless burglar tried to hide his identity by moving a CCTV camera, but just ended up pointing it at a mirror which captured his face.

The man was caught on camera as he robbed a Coral Gables law firm in Florida on 19 September.

Police have now released the video in an attempt to catch the man who stole around $3,700.

A hapless burglar tried to hide his identity by moving a CCTV camera, but just ended up pointing it at a mirror which captured his face

In the clip the thief can be seen creeping into the law firm's suite.

He moves the surveillance camera to try to conceal his identity, but instead angles it towards the elevators where a large mirror is located, allowing the camera to continue to capture his actions.

Police said he went to the office where he forced open a drawer and left with the money.

'He opened the door,' attorney Carlos Del Amo, told NBC Miami.

'He did not pry it open.

'There was no destruction to my front door, so either he had a key or he knew how to jimmy the door.'

Del Amo said the fact there was money in the office was 'very strange' timing.

'I don't keep that amount of money in my office at any time, but that day I had a client come in and give me that,' he said.

'While the money is important, okay, it's not in comparison to feeling violated.

Coral Gables Police Officer Kelly Denham told WSVN.com: 'Fortunately for us he was not smart enough to recognize that when he tilted the camera, he titled it right toward a mirror located right in front of the elevators to capture more of his movements.

'He then eventually covered it up,' Denham said, 'but it was a little too late, so what we're doing is we're asking for the public's help to try to ID this person.'
