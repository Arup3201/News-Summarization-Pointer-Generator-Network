Powerful loss: Julia Gillard stepped down as Prime Minister after losing the Labor leadership

Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has spoken for the first time about her ‘physical and emotional acute distress’ at losing her position of power.

Ms Gillard, 51, was ousted as the leader of the country’s Labor party this June, forcing her to resign as prime minister.

She describes the loss of her position as being ‘hit like a fist’ and says she grieves the loss of her political career.

Writing for The Guardian Australia, she speaks of a pain ‘so strong you feel it in your guts, your nerve endings.’

She was ousted in a leadership challenge on June 26th this year which saw her predecessor Kevin Rudd re-take the position as leader of the party.

‘Losing power is felt physically, emotionally, in waves of sensation, in moments of acute distress,’ Ms Gillard writes, adding that since finding herself without a party and country to lead, she sometimes finds herself realising what it feels to be relaxed and not under constant strain.

‘I know now that there are the odd moments of relief as the stress ekes away and the hard weight that felt like it was sitting uncomfortably between your shoulder blades slips off.

'It actually takes you some time to work out what your neck and shoulders are supposed to feel like.

‘I know too that you can feel you are fine but then suddenly someone’s words of comfort, or finding a memento at the back of the cupboard as you pack up, or even cracking jokes about old times, can bring forth a pain that hits you like a fist, pain so strong you feel it in your guts, your nerve endings.’

Julia Gillard was born in Barry in Wales and her family immigrated to Australia when she was five years old.

Following a double degree in Bachelor of Arts and Law from University of Melbourne she worked as a lawyer before entering politics for the Labor Party.

Woman in charge: Julia Gillard became Australia's first female Prime Minister in 2010 when she took over from Kevin Rudd, who eventually took her seat this June

She became the first female Deputy Prime Minister in Australia's history in 2007 under Kevin Rudd, and took over as Prime Minister in 2010.

Last week, just a few months after he took over from Ms Gillard, Mr Rudd led his party to a defeat in Australia’s federal election.

After losing out to Conservative Tony Abbott he has stepped down as leader of the Labor Party.

Julia Gillard made a promise when she was outvoted as head of Labor that she would retire from politics and is now expected to follow a similar route of ex British Prime Minister Tony Blair and enter into public speaking.

In her open letter, she criticised Labor’s switch back to Rudd just weeks ahead of the election.

She says saying it sent Australians 'a very cynical and shallow message' about the party's sense of purpose.

She writes: 'It was not done because caucus now believed Kevin Rudd had the greater talent for governing.

'It was only done — indeed expressly done  - on the basis that Labor might do better at the election.

'Labor unambiguously sent a very clear message that it cared about nothing other than the prospects of survival of its members of parliament at the polls.'

In addition, Ms Gillard writes, Mr Rudd failed to articulate a reason why he had been installed as leader, saying that he brought ‘not one truly original new idea to substitute as the lifeblood of the campaign.’

Following her promise to depart from politics, she praises her former colleagues, urging them to unite.

‘I know that my colleagues are feeling all this now. Those who lost, those who remain. We have some grieving to do together.'
