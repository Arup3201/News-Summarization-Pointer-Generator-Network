Facing the music: Jesse Calloway turned himself in and was charged with misdemeanor graffiti

A Houston teenager turned himself in to police Friday to
face charges over defacing a replica Space Shuttle.

Jesse Calloway, 19, was wanted for scrawling racist and
politically-motivated graffiti Nov 27 on the replica shuttle outside Space
Center Houston.

The graffiti defaced one side of the model, and included the
words ‘Houston we are the problem.’

Racist messages and a cartoon teddy bear were also scribbled
on to the right side of the mock space ship.

The brazen work was first discovered by a tour bus operator
cruising past the landmark site, according to KHOU.

Mr Calloway had been wanted for some time before turning
himself in to the Harris County Precinct 8 Constable’s Office, according to the
station.

Officials were tipped off to him being the vandal through an
anonymous call to Crime Stoppers.

The teen told investigators that he was part of a group of
people who tagged the ship in the early morning hours of Nov 27, officials told
the Houston Chronicle.

'The ultimate tag': Mr Calloway boasted of his graffiti prowess while being questioned by investigators

‘He told investigators this would be the ultimate tag,’ an
official told the paper.

The hooligan has not named the other people who helped him
deface the space ship, the official added.

Visitors to the park the day the graffiti was discovered
told KHOU they didn’t understand why someone would deface a replica space
shuttle.

‘I think probably, to the people, they thought there was a
message, but no one else besides them knows, and it’s kind of pointless
really,’ one woman told the station.

‘To do it with this, it’s kind of off the wall,’ another
visitor said. ‘It’s disgusting.’

It cost roughly $500 to clean the spray paint off the
shuttle, which arrived in Houston in 2012, according to KHOU. It had previously
been on display at Florida’s Kennedy Space Center.

Pointless: Park visitors said they didn't understand what the vandals were trying to say with the graffiti

It is sitting outside Houston’s Johnson Space Center and
will be part of a larger exhibit on the history of the space program, according
to the Chronicle.

Mr Calloway was charged with misdemeanour graffiti and
granted a $1,000 bail. He has since posted and been released.

Investigators are still working to find the other vandals.
