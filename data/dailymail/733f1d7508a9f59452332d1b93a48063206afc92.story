It's every little girls dream to look like a princess and now thanks to a new app you can... kind of. 

The YouCam Make Up promises to make users look just like Cinderella, just in time to tie in with the release of the new film starring Lily James.

Or, if you fancy taking a walk on the dark side you could try out being Cinder's evil step-mother.

The free app which is downloadable from the app store on your phone harnesses the latest facial detection and skin analysis technology to precisely apply realistic cosmetic looks on selfies and other photos.

YouCam Makeup also features a complete set of true-to-life makeup effects, including eye shadow palettes, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, foundation, as well as hairstyles and flawless skin effects.

'With our new princess looks, we wanted to empower users with beauty tools to help them visualize themselves as the hero of their own story and feel more confident in their photos.' said Alice H. Chang, CEO of CyberLink.

The new element to the already hugely successful app comes just ahead of the new Cinderella film's release this Friday.  

Femail put the app, which has previously claimed it could turn us into supermodels, to the test to see how Princess-like we could look...

Whilst we certainly looked more made up than before, did we really look like Cinderella? 

Bianca London thought she looked 'terrifying' as the evil stepmother but liked the blue eyes

Writer Olivia Foster said: 'While I was pleased that the app seemed to smooth out my imperfections, I would have liked it to add a few more sparkles and perhaps a crown.

'After all, you're not really a true Princess until you have a crown. 

'Also, I am unsure about the eye make application, especially on the evil step-mother look,  as it made me look a little bit like I was squinting.'

Food writer Anucyia Victor said: 'I wasn't that impressed with the app as there didn't seem to be much difference between the step-mother look and the Cinderella transformation. 

 

The YouCam Make Up app has a new element which means you can make yourself look like Cinderella

'I would have liked to have looked a lot more evil as the step-mother! I'd also like to see some-more looks, for example, Pocahontas.

'It also gave me a fatter face, which I wasn't too pleased with!'

And writer Bianca London said: 'I think Cinderella got carried away with her new blusher and what is with that droopy brow? 

'As for the evil stepmother, I look nothing short of terrifying. I quite like my blue eyes and, of course, Scouse brows do befit the evil stepmother.'
