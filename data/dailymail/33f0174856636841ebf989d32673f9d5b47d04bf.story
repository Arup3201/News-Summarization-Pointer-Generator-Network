Facebook co-founder and former Mark Zuckerberg roommate, Dustin Moskovitz, is by many accounts the world's youngest self-made billionaire. But as Facebook's long-awaited May 18 share floatation approaches, the 27-year-old isn't sipping champagne in the Caribbean.

Instead he is in the mist of throwing himself back into San Francisco's start-up mix, even as the looming IPO seems likely to send his wealth spiraling even higher.

Moskovitz and his friend Justin Rosenstein, a former Facebooker himself worth $150 million, head a company called Asana which employees 24 staff and is run out of inconspicuous Mission District offices, where it just launched the first paid version of its online project management service.

And the pair have no plans to retire.

'When we think of work, we think of work as an act of service, as an act of love for humanity,' said Rosenstein, 28, in a recent interview.

Added Moskovitz: 'If we were just retired, we wouldn't be serving anyone.'

Like Zuckerberg, reportedly worth $17.5 billion and rarely seen out of a
hoodie, they seem uninterested in the flash and status-hoarding that great wealth makes possible.They don’t have an entourage, sit among their staff in the office, and prefer to dress down.

Casual: Moskovitz prefers to dress-down and sits among his employees in the office

On the streets of their neighborhood, which brims with twenty-something hipster geeks, they'd blend right in.

What sets them apart, they acknowledge, is their absolute freedom to pursue their particular vision of how to change the world. And they seem to have no doubt that their software will do just that. After all, as some of Facebook's earliest engineers, they've seen their code change the world once already.

Moskovitz spent two years at Harvard where he helped Zuckerberg start the site before they dropped out and moved to Palo Alto. He left Facebook in 2008 and started Asana with Rosenstein.

Like other similar products, their software lets users set up Web-based to-do lists that any group focused on a common goal can use to assign jobs and keep track of what gets done.

The pair believe Asana will win out on its speed, versatility and ability to maintain the flow alluded to in its name, which in yoga refers to the poses meant to aid the flow of spiritual energy in the body.

Regular yoga sessions are among the 
perks of office life at Asana. Other benefits include an in-house chef 
and $10,000 for new hires to set up their desks with whatever computing 
gear they want.

Several marquee tech companies have embraced Asana, the company reports, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Foursquare. Individual backers betting on Asana include venture capital celebrities like Peter Thiel and Mark Andreessen, as well as several of Facebook's earliest employees.

Moskovitz holds nearly 134 million shares of Facebook stock, giving him a 7.6 per cent stake in the company.

His net worth stands at more than $4 billion but like many of the richest Americans, Moskovitz has signed a pledge initiated by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett to give away most of his money. His wife runs his philanthropic foundation, which is still getting off the ground.

Contrary to Moskovitz’s modest lifestyle, fellow Facebook investor Eduardo Saverin and his estimated $2billion fortune have been living it up in Singapore, where he has 
become notorious for his playboy lifestyle.

He regularly buys bottles of 
Moet champagne and Belvedere vodka at the most exclusive clubs in the company of the super-rich, drives a Bentley and lives in a penthouse in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods.

Blogs have sprung up tracking his partying with many locals hoping to get close to the self-made billionaire.

According to Asia Tatler, Saverin is a 
fan of hanging out at Singapore's only private members club Filter in the 
Conrad Hotel.

Investment: Saverin has invested in a start-up cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Singapore 2009, to whom he also offers his business expertise

The whirlwind 
of parties, adoring friends and fast cars seems to have left little time 
for business apart from Saverin's investment in Rachel K - a start-up 
cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Universe 2009 whom 
Saverin also mentors.

During a launch for the brand at a rooftop party, Saverin said: 'With a company like Facebook, it's not just three people deciding how the world communicates, it's really about providing a tool so your customers can be themselves.'

He added: 'I think it really inspired me to see that she [Rachel Kum] went from Miss Singapore to pushing her line, that she's going with her passion.'

He has also ploughed money into information site Qwiki and online payment service Jumio.

The Facebook share flotation is expected to happen on Friday, May 18, with Mark Zuckerberg planning to start the 'roadshow' preceding the initial public offering (IPO) on Monday.

The social 
network, now eight years old, has 900million members and was valued at up to $79.3 billion.

It
is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world's biggest - 
stock market entry of an Internet company since Google floated in 2004.

Zuckerberg, Saverin and the original start-up Facebook team including Dustin Moskovitz, Sean Parker and Chris Hughes were immortalised in the 2010 film The Social Network.

Saverin was played by Andrew Garfield and is portrayed as a slightly naive player in the game. Moskovitz was played by Joseph Mazzello.

One thing Saverin does prize highly
is his privacy and closely guards details of his life. He attends few 
of the many public events he is invited to speak at and endorse and 
rarely gives interviews.

It
is presumably why he chose to set up home in Singapore which has 
relatively few tabloids and paparazzi who follow the rich and famous 
compared to the U.S. and Europe.

Those
who wish to speak to him on a business level must try to make contact 
through an intricate network of society contacts and similarly rich 
friends.

John Fearon, CEO of Singapore-based start-ups dropmysite.com and dropmyemail.com told the Wall Street Journal: 'Eduardo doesn't invest in much. He doesn't invest in Singapore companies.'

Last August, Saverin was spotted partying with dozens of models in St Tropez and spending $50,000 on champagne.

He flew a number of his friends over from Singapore and checked into the $8,000-a-night Hotel Byblos before going clubbing until the early hours.

The entrepreneur was also seen at the trendy Bagatelle Brunch in Nikki Beach with three friends and ten beautiful women drinking Cristal champagne from the bottle and spraying it over each other. The bar tab reportedly came to a cool $50,000.
