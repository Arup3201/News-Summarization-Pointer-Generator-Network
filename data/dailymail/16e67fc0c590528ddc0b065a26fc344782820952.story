A dying father known as 'napkin dad' for his daily heartfelt notes to his daughter, has celebrated seeing her achieve another milestone: making her high school varsity softball team. 

Garth Callaghan, 45, from Glen Allen, Virginia, has been writing short messages on napkins for his daughter Emma, 15, since she was in kindergarten - and now she looks forward to them every day.

The heartwarming ritual has scored him a book deal and a movie is said to be in the works too.

This week the doting father-of-one - who has stage four kidney cancer - uploaded a snapshot to Facebook revealing his latest note, reading: 'Dear Emma, I'm so proud that you made the varsity softball team. I can't wait till your first game!'

Garth says doctors do not know how long he has to live but he's determined to remain strong. 

'My goal is to actually write notes for my grandkids and I can't think of a better thing to fight for every single day.'

Emma says that she also maintains a positive attitude when it comes to her father's illness.

'I don't even really think about the fact he has cancer too much because he's so present and always there.' 

The note-writing has long been a tradition in the Callaghan household; it began when Garth worked a busy sales job in Emma's elementary school days and wouldn't see her often.

Thoughtful gesture: It began when Garth worked a busy sales job in Emma's elementary school days and wouldn't see her often 

Daily dose: So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box

Still going strong: But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos

So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box. 

But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos.

Some days, she would look at her lunch before he had placed on inside, and she'd demand to know where it was.

'That's when I realized, this is something that really matters,' Garth said.

Garth's wife, Lissa, said the task also means he's taken over the chore of making his daughter's lunch, which he tries to keep healthy.

'I think it's great,' she said. 'It's nice that he keeps that connection with her.'

Lunchtime treat: He pops the notes in with her lunch, which he tries to make as nutritious as he can

Determined: After learning he had cancer, Garth sought to write 800 notes so that his daughter would have one every day throughout high school - even if he was no longer alive to put it in her lunch box

But in 2011, Garth was diagnosed with cancer and his desire to write the notes became even stronger because, 'at the end of the day, these notes might be the only thing my daughter has left of me'.

His tumor was successfully removed - but he has since been diagnosed twice more, and his doctor has told him that he will lose his life to the disease.

A loss of taste, tiredness and nausea are among the symptoms which blight Garth. He says his ultimate hope is to inspire parents to write notes to their children.

His book, Napkin Notes: Make Lunch Meaningful, Life Will Follow, has been published in several countries and half a dozen languages.

In the tome, Garth  introduces each chapter with a napkin note and then shares a story connected to it and to his life. 

The cancer patient is now writing notes ahead of time and storing them away so his daughter can still receive them after he is gone.
