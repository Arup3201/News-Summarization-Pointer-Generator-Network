Britain consumes more anti-depressants than almost all our neighbours in Europe, an international study has found.

The UK has the seventh-highest prescribing rate for drugs such as Prozac in the Western world, with 71 daily doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011.

This is almost double the 38 doses a day prescribed a decade earlier, according to the study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents the world’s industrialised nations.

The surge has led to concerns among some doctors that antidepressants are being overprescribed in Britain.

There has been a particular rise in the use of a family of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), like Prozac and Seroxat. There have been concerns that some of these drugs may be linked to suicide attempts among younger users.

These SSRIs are taken by almost 4million people in the UK every year.

The OECD figures show Iceland to have the highest prescribing rate, at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011, up from 71 a decade earlier.

Behind Iceland is Australia, then Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal. The lowest levels are seen in Chile and South Korea.

Antidepressant use in the UK is far higher than much of mainland Europe.

In France and Germany, for example, prescriptions are at only two thirds the level – at 50 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants. In Italy, the level is just 42 doses a day.

A spokesman for the OECD said: ‘The consumption of certain types of prescribed drugs has increased significantly since 2000 in the UK, notably the consumption of antidepressants and antibiotics. 

‘As in several other countries, the rise in consumption of antidepressants preceded the financial and economic crisis in 2008, but consumption has continued to grow rapidly since then: it nearly doubled in the UK between 2000 and 2011, and is now well above the OECD average. 

‘Greater intensity and duration of treatments are some of the factors explaining the rise in antidepressant consumption in the United Kingdom and other countries.’ 

The increases in antidepressant use has caused concern because rates of depression have not risen to the same extent – indicating that doctors may be prescribing the drugs unnecessarily for people will only mild depression.

The OECD said that rising consumption levels could be explained by the use of antidepressants in milder cases. ‘These extensions have raised concerns about appropriateness,’ it said.

Dr Mark van Ommeren, of the World Health Organisation's department of mental health and substance abuse, said: ‘The explosion of antidepressants you see in most countries reflects the fact that lots of people with moderate to severe depression are getting treatment – that's a good thing.

‘But the negative thing is that a lot of people are getting antidepressants who shouldn't be getting them. Doctors and healthcare providers should be able to recognise depression correctly so that those who need antidepressants get them and those with only mild cases do not get prescribed.’

Professor Tim Cantopher, consultant psychiatrist with the Priory Group in the UK, said: ‘Antidepressants are widely oversubscribed to get rid of unhappiness.

‘They were not designed for that. Unhappiness is part of the human condition. But real clinical depression does respond to antidepressants. And not to prescribe in these cases is to sentence an individual to a far longer illness than he or she need suffer.’

Professor Tim Kendall, director of the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health in the UK, said the rise was a ‘testament to the effective marketing by the pharmaceutical industry’.

‘I also wonder if, in better-off countries, we don’t have time to be depressed and seek chemical solutions to “get rid of it”.’

The OECD figures on antidepressants were contained in their Health at a Glance 2013 report, released yesterday. It also showed that Britain’s cancer survival rates are on a par with Eastern Europe, and that our GPs are the best paid in the Western world.
