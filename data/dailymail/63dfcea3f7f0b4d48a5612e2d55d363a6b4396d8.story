Gareth Bale said he felt 'fulfilled' after a brilliant debut season with Real Madrid, which culminated in Champions League success.

The 25-year-old joined Real last year and has already lifted three trophies, including the Champions League. 

Bale said: 'Winning the club's tenth (Champions League) title was fantastic for everyone. Scoring a goal in the European Cup final is one of my biggest dreams.

'It was a good season for the team. I felt fulfilled.'

The former Tottenham man's ambitions remain undiminished, though, and Bale said the club will aim to become the first team in history to retain the Champions League.

'We have to look to the future and try to win it again,' he said. 'We want to make history by winning the Champions League again.

'We know there is always a lot of pressure on us, but we like it and we want to win more titles this year.'
