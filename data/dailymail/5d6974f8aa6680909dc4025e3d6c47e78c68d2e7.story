A Spanish state research vessel carried out 'irresponsible' and 'dangerous' manoeuvring in British Gibraltar territorial waters, potentially risking the lives of Royal Navy personnel, the Foreign Office said.

Europe minister David Lidington called Spain's secretary of state for foreign affairs Gonzalo de Benito to express 'grave concerns' about the incident, which occurred yesterday.

It is the latest in a series of rows between the UK and Spain over Gibraltar, and Mr Lidington stressed that the waters around the territory are 'indisputably British'.

Mr Lidington said: 'The irresponsible actions and dangerous manoeuvring of this vessel were not only unlawful but also presented a significant risk to the safety of Royal Navy personnel at sea.

'Under no circumstances should Spanish vessels be provoking a situation that could result in serious injury or a fatality.

'The waters around Gibraltar are indisputably British. We will continue to take whatever action we consider necessary to uphold British sovereignty and the interests of Gibraltar, its people, its security and economy.'

The incident yesterday involved the two-year-old, 951-ton research vessel Angeles Alvarino, which the Foreign Office said deployed equipment to survey two locations within British Gibraltar territorial waters.

The incident is just 24 hours after news that Spanish fighter jets flew 'across the bow' of a Monarch airliner as it landed on Gibraltar.

Angeles Alvarino entered Europa Point in British Gibraltar Territorial Waters to 'take samples' of the reef at 3pm local time.

The Royal Navy immediately surrounded the vessel and ordered it out of British waters but the captain of Angeles Alvarino ignored the demands and probes were put into the seas.

One of them landed on a Royal Navy Rigid-hulled Inflatable Boat, which had been sent out to investigate.

Mr Lidington said: 'The irresponsible actions and dangerous manoeuvring of this vessel were not only unlawful but also presented a significant risk to the safety of Royal Navy personnel at sea.'

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office added: 'The British Government takes very seriously any attempt by Spain to exert authority or control within British Gibraltar Territorial Waters and considers such incursions as a violation of UK sovereignty.
