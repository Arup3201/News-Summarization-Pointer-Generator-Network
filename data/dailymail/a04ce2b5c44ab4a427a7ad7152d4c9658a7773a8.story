A pair of frisky Louisianans were arrested last week for allegedly engaging in oral sex in a moving vehicle.

A Kenner police officer pulled over driver Mario Espinal, 33, and his passenger Arletha Alexander, 46, on New Year's Day after first noticing them driving with no headlights around 10pm.

The officer said he then noticed someone's head 'moving in an up and down motion' before the passenger began to 'scramble' back to her seat.

Once  at the side of the road, the officer says he found Espinal with his pants hanging down by his knees, reports NOLA.com.

Caught: Mario Espinal, 33, and his passenger Arletha Alexander, 46, were arrested New Year's Day after a cop noticed them engaged in oral sex with Espinal behind the wheel of a moving vehicle

In his pants leg was a bulge that turned out to be Espinal's underwear. 

When questioned, Espinal allegedly came clean to the officer, saying Alexander offered to trade him oral sex for a ride.

Alexander, however, demurred. She told the officer that she would never perform such an act on Espinal because, reports NOLA, 'she didn't even know him.'

Both were arrested.

Espinal was charged with obscenity, prostitution, crimes against nature, driving with no license, failure to obey a police officer, failure to use headlights and having no registration certificate.

He was held without bond thanks to an unrelated fugitive charge.

Alexander's bond was set at $9,500 after she was booked for prostitution, obscenity, crimes against nature and four traffic attachments.

She remained behind bars as of Tuesday.

Pants down: Espinal and Alexander were cruising down this Kenner, Louisiana street during the alleged incident. Espinal's pants were slung near his knees when the officer pulled them over. His underwear were wadded in his pants leg somewhere near his ankle
