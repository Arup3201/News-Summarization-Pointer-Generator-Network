The company started by the Google founder's ex-wife has been ordered to stop selling their at-home genetic testing kits because the FDA says they are not backed by science.

Sergey Brin's wife Anne Wojcicki launched the company, called 23andMe, in 2006 and the Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to Ms Wojcicki on Friday.

This step comes after many rounds of back-and-forth between the FDA and 23andMe, not to mention a personally difficult year for Ms Wojcicki after she and her husband split following the revelation that he was said to be having a relationship with a 27-year-old Google employee.

'However, even after these many interactions with 23andMe, we still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated the (Personal Genome Service) for its intended uses, which have expanded from the uses that the firm identified in its submissions,' the FDA wrote in its letter, listing multiple instances where they did not respond to calls for clarification.

The FDA's letter is demanding that the company 'discontinue marketing the PGS until such time as it receives FDA marketing authorization for the device'.

The personal testing kits retail for only $99, and though it is meant to give peace of mind for a small price, the federal agency asserts that it could be ineffective.

The concern at the FDA comes from the fact that the device claims to identify more than 250 diseases and conditions, but the agency asserts that the scientific research does not back up the company's claims.

'For instance, if the BRCA-related risk assessment for breast or ovarian cancer reports a false positive, it could lead a patient to undergo prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention, intensive screening, or other morbidity-inducing actions, while a false negative could result in a failure to recognize an actual risk that may exist,' the FDA wrote in the letter posted online.

Dangerous conclusions: The FDA asserts that the research behind 23andMe tests is not solid enough and may cause people the believe false negatives and avoid seeking treatment

Wojcicki started the DNA testing venture in 2006, one year before she and Brin got married. The company has raised $68million in venture capital, has 70 employees and nearly 150,000 paying members.

Ms Wojcicki studied biology as an undergraduate at Yale and then went on to manage healthcare investments and biotechnology funding.

'From her vantage point, Anne saw a need for creating a way to generate more information - especially more personalized information - so that commercial and academic researchers could better understand and develop new drugs and diagnostics,' the company's website reads.

The 40-year-old has two children with her husband Sergey Brin- a nearly 5-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter.

Brin was one of the early investors, underwrote the costs for creating and testing the company's research on Parkinson's disease as his mother suffers from the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.

In August, Sergey Brin's spokesperson confirmed that he and Ms Wojcicki had been living apart for several months.

Other woman? After the separation, Brin (right, seen at an event with Dian von Furstenberg) appeared publicly with Amanda Rosenberg (left), a 27-year-old Google employee who he is said to have started a relationship with

Since their separation was made public, more information has emerged about the Silicon Valley titan's new paramour, the British-born Amanda Rosenberg, 27, who left London in search of fame and fortune with Google.

There is no suggestion that the pair became an item before Mr Brin’s separation from Ms Wojcicki.

Google has been rocked by talk of the romance, and a spokesman yesterday confirmed that Brin – one of the world’s richest men with a $22.8billion fortune – has for several months been living apart from his wife of six years, the mother of his two children.

If they divorce, Californian law suggests their massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement.
