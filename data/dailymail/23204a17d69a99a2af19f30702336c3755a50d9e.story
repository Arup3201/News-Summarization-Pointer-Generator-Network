Joe Andrews, 19, died in a crash after he briefly fell asleep at the wheel.
His grieving family and girlfriend are now committed to making people aware of the potential hazard of 'microsleep'

An exhausted teenager died in a crash after he 'microslept' at the wheel.

Experts said Joe Andrews, 19, dozed off for just a few seconds when his Vauxhall Corsa collided with a HGV on the A590 at Linda in Cumbria.

An inquest established that the cause of the accident last year was caused by Joe having a microsleep - a sleep lasting just one to 30 seconds where the eyes can stay open, usually caused by sleep deprivation.

Joe’s grieving family and girlfriend are now committed to making people aware of the hazard of microsleep so other families do not have to go through their anguish.

Joe, of New Leys, in Barrow, Cumbria, had been out fishing and digging for bait in the early hours.

He picked up and his girlfriend Allanah Salton, and they went for a drive and to watch the sunrise together. The accident happened as they were heading back to Barrow at around 5am.

Joe had been driving well under the speed limit at 40mph, as had the HGV driver.

The North West Air Ambulance transported Joe from Furness General Hospital to the Royal Preston Hospital, where he later died.

Mother Julie, Andrews, 49, said: 'We are having really good weather this summer and it was good weather when Joseph had his accident.

'Microsleep caused Joseph’s accident. He hadn’t been drinking or taking drugs, he wasn’t speeding, he wasn’t smoking, he wasn’t on his phone, he just had that microsleep and unfortunately his injuries were too bad for him to be saved.

'We want to raise awareness about microsleep, particularly among young people who are finishing college or university for the summer. They stay up all night on social media, gaming, talking to friends and trying to fit so much in.

'We want to explain from the parents’ point of view and warn about the hazard we don’t see, you don’t think of tiredness.

'I never wanted to be a "what if" mother but I am. You think if only the car had been five minutes earlier or later Joseph would have rolled into the verge and he would have phoned and said I’ve damaged my car, and it would not have damaged him like it did.

'We’ve lost our only child, we have lost our life. It rips your world apart.

'It was that one little second that changed our lives forever. All our hopes and dreams have gone with him.'

Father Gavin Andrews, 50, said: 'The kids have just had all the pressure lifted off them at the end of their exams. You see them on Facebook up at goodness knows what time and a lot of them are mobile with mopeds and cars.

'As parents you drum into your kids about drink and drugs but you don’t think of this microsleep, sleep deprivation. We want them to be aware of this danger.

'It’s happened to all of us. How many times have you nodded off in front of the TV? You can rewind a TV programme, we can’t rewind what happened to Joseph.'

He added: 'You can’t decide when it happens, your brain shuts down and your eyes can be open.

'This message is for kids who still have the summer in front of them. We don’t want other parents to feel like we do, or girlfriends and boyfriends to feel like Allanah does. One second can change your life.'

Allanah, 17, who was injured in the accident, said: 'Everyone thinks it won’t happen to you. Just think about everyone involved.

'Some people still think Joe had been speeding but he hadn’t. He was sensible and a good driver.'

Joe, who studied joinery and carpentry at nearby Furness College, was popular with his friends.

Popular: Joe was described as a joker and 'would make people feel good about themselves'

Allanah added: 'He was unique, everyone knew him, he was a joker. Joe just had a special thing about him. He would speak to anyone and he would make people feel good about themselves.

'We loved being in the car, that car gave us our adventures, and it has given me memories.'

Mrs Andrews said: 'Joe lit the place up. He was a good-hearted kid, who had respect for people young and old. He was unique. Everyone enjoyed his company.'

The family said Joe was always helping others, such as following a friend’s car in the snow when they were nervous about driving. They said his friends looked out for one another, always having a designated driver to call upon after a night out.

Coroner for South Cumbria, Mr Ian Smith, said: 'It was a momentary matter and sadly Joseph paid the ultimate price for it.'

Mr Smith recorded a verdict of death in a road traffic collision.

Microsleeps are brief, unintended episodes of loss of attention associated with events such as blank stare, head snapping, and prolonged eye closure which may occur when a person is fatigued but trying to stay awake to perform a monotonous task like driving a car or watching a computer screen.

These are potentially among the most dangerous consequences of insomnia.

Microsleep episodes last from a few seconds to two minutes, and often the person is not aware that a microsleep has occurred. In fact, microsleeps often occur when a person's eyes are open. While in a microsleep, a person fails to respond to outside information.

A person will not see a red signal light or notice that the road has taken a curve, which is why this phenomenon is of particular interest to people who study drowsy driving. During a microsleep, a pilot might not be aware of flashing alarm lights in the cockpit.

Microsleeps are most likely to occur at certain times of the day, such as pre-dawn hours and mid-afternoon hours when the body is programmed to sleep.

It is estimated that drowsy driving is a factor in 10 to 30 per cent of all crashes.
