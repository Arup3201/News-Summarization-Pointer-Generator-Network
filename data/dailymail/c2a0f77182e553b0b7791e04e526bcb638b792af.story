Elegant in summery pale green and pink florals, the Queen was on typically stylish form as she arrived at a school in London this afternoon and was met by crowds of cheering pupils.

The Queen also revealed that she, like the Duchess of Cambridge, is a fan of recycling her outfits, after she arrived in the same Angela Kelly ensemble that she wore to watch the action on day two at Royal Ascot last year.

But while this visit didn't have much in the way of horses, there was plenty of sporting action on offer as the Queen was treated to an assured display of fencing as she opened the new sports hall at Westminster School.

All smiles: The Queen beamed as she met pupils at Westminster School and appeared to enjoy the fencing display almost as much as the racing

The Queen, who is scheduled to appear at this year's Royal Ascot which takes place next week, is a regular at the races and was last spotted enjoying the Derby on Saturday after rushing back from Paris.

A keen racing fan, the Queen's career as a racehorse breeder and owner spans more than 60 years, and began with the handful that she was left by her father George VI.

Since then, her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races, including all five British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby, although she has managed a second place finish with Aureole in 1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton House.

While the Derby has so far eluded her, the Queen has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the UK, among them Dunfermline who managed to win both the Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 Guineas in 1958.

Stylish: Like the Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen is fond of getting as much wear out of her favourite ensembles as she possibly can

Thrilled: The Queen couldn't hide her delight as her bay filly Estimate romped home to triumph in the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot last year

Last year, the Queen achieved a long cherished ambition when her filly Estimate romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - much to the obvious delight of the monarch.

Her appearance at next week's Royal Ascot will be the latest in a series of engagements, which began last week with the State Opening of Parliament and a state visit to France for the D-Day celebrations.

After processing down the Champs-Élysées on Thursday evening, the Queen spent the Friday meeting world leaders and paying her respects to the fallen in Bayeux and on Sword Beach.

The following day, she toured the Marche aux Fleurs - now renamed Reine Elizabeth II - before rushing back to the UK just in time to see chestnut three-year-old Australia romp home to victory in the £1.3m Derby.

This week has also proved busy with the Duke of Edinburgh's birthday on Tuesday followed by today's visit to Westminster School.
