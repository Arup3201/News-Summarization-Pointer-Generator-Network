Reassurances: Thailand's Deputy PM Chalerm Yubamrung confirmed a man had been arrested on suspicion of a terror plot in Bangkok, but insisted the situation was under control

British tourists were warned today to beware of possible attacks targeting westerners in Thailand after police thwarted a terror plot in Bangkok.

The US Embassy revealed a ‘real and credible’ threat against Americans and western holidaymakers in the Thai capital.

The alert – the first of its kind in Bangkok in recent memory – followed the arrest of a Lebanese man with suspected links to Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.

He was seized following a tip-off that helped foil a planned attack on New Year’s Eve. A second plotter was still at large last night.

US officials urged Americans to ‘keep a low profile’ in public and to exercise caution in areas where western tourists gather.

‘Foreign terrorists may be currently looking to conduct attacks against tourist areas in Bangkok in the near future,’ they added.

The warning in Bangkok comes at a time of heightened tension between the West and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.

Thousands of mourners chanted anti-US and Israeli slogans at the funeral in Tehran yesterday of slain nuclear expert Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Wednesday’s motorcycle bombing a ‘cowardly assassination’ and accused the US and Israel of being behind the attack.

American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denied the US played any role in the bombing.

Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Chalerm Yubamrung said Israelis were thought to be the targets of the New Year’s Eve terror plot in Bangkok.

‘At first, we were told the Palestinians were behind it, but it turned out to be Hezbollah,’ he said.

He said two men were arrested on Thursday.

‘The authorities had been following two Lebanese men and called in one of them for questioning,’ he said.

‘Technically the two men have not committed any crimes under Thai law so we could only use the immigration law to keep this one suspect in custody,’ he added.

Despite the US warning, he insisted the danger had passed: ‘I want to confirm and I am confident that we have the situation under control.

'And I can guarantee no terrorist attacks will be allowed to take place. If they have disagreement, they should go fight somewhere else.’

Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant group, is the most potent military force in Lebanon, far stronger than even the national army. It is backed mainly by Iran and Syria.
