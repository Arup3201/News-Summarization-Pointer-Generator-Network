Facebook has been heavily criticised by users and authorities alike about the way the site harvests personal data and uses it for advertising.

But the social network’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has spoken out in defence of the site, vehemently denying sharing its user's data.

During an interview with BBC Breakfast, Sandberg said Facebook was very protective of its users' privacy and personal data.

She continued that despite the use of personalised ads, the site 'does nothing to compromise its user’s data.'

'Privacy is of the utmost concern and importance to Facebook and it's important to us that the people who use our service know that we are very protective of them,' Sandberg explained.

‘It is their data, they have control of it, they share it.

‘When we are able to personalise ads, we are doing that without sharing their private data with any advertisers.’

Her comments follow the launch of the UK and Ireland Small Business Council at the company's international headquarters in Dublin.

This council aims to increase participation between Facebook and small to medium-sized businesses.

Sandberg said working with small to medium-sized businesses was important because ‘our missions are inextricably tied and the challenge and the opportunity of this huge technological shift that we're going through is one that we can work together (on).

Sandberg said that despite the use of personalised ads, Facebook 'does nothing to compromise its user's data. Privacy is of the utmost concern and importance to Facebook and it's important to us that the people who use our service know that we are very protective of them. It is their data, they have control of it, they share it'

When a company creates an advert, they can add a number of parameters to target the most appropriate people.

These include the user's location, gender, age, likes and interests, relationship status, workplace and education.

Rather than sharing this information directly with advertisers, Facebook uses a process called hashing.

For example, personal information such as email addresses and names are automatically encrypted - making it impossible for the advertisers to uniquely identify the user.

Facebook then converts the other information into a sequence of numbers and letters. 

For example, the information for an 18-year-old who likes reading the MailOnline and lives in Boston becomes a string of numbers, along the lines of '145sjfor23455djj'.

Adverts are then matched to the appropriate series of characters, meaning private data is never directly shared.

‘We have 25 million small to medium-sized businesses around the world that use our free products to set up a page and use it to reach their customers.

‘So just as I can share with you if we're friends on Facebook, small businesses can reach their customers.’

The sixth most powerful woman in the world, according to Forbes magazine, said: ‘We are in the middle of the fastest adoption of disruptive technology the world has ever seen.

'The word 'online' is becoming an old-fashioned word because we're all going to be connected all the time.’

Sandberg also wrote and published Lean In last March, which advised women on how to be more confident and successful at work by becoming more involved and to face their fears.

But she said there was still more to be done: ‘Despite all the progress women have made, men still have the great majority of the leadership positions in every business, in every industry, in every country in the world.

'It's really important that since women make up half the population, women start having half the seats at tables where decisions are made, and that's not where we are today.'

She said women thinking about doing something should ask themselves what they would do if they were not afraid and then do it.
