Christopher Bailey hit the headlines recently when he was named CEO of Burberry at the age of just 42.

And his successful streak shows no sign of coming to an end: the Yorkshire-born designer has now been inducted into the fashion Hall of Fame at the fourth annual WGSN Global Fashion Awards 2013.

The Hall of Fame honour is the ceremony's most prestigious award and is given to an individual who has 'furthered the interests of the industry, broken new ground and inspired the world', according to WGSN.

Previous winners of the prize include photographer Rankin and Biba founder Barbara Hulanicki.

The 
designer has been a driving force at Burberry since he joined
the label as creative director in 2001, and took the reins as chief 
creative officer in 2009.

In a statement released by the brand, 
Bailey described himself as 'humbled' after being offered the role which
he will take up in mid-2014 when current CEO Angela Ahrendts departs 
for Apple.

The WGSN Global Fashion Awards, which took place at the Victoria & 
Albert Museum last night, recognise international achievement in fashion and retail design.

Other A-list attendees include Amber Le Bon, who presented an award and pulled out all the stops with her outfit.

The 24-year-old model looked stunning in her unusual floor-length dress as she arrived at the star-studded event.

She completed her look a simple top knot and stunning drop earrings which matched her sparkly, silver clutch.

Laura Whitmore, 28, stood out on the 
red carpet in a statement mini dress by designer Nicholas Oakwell.

The
MTV star's flamboyant frock was covered in white feathers giving a 
voluminous shape, cinched in with a silver belt.

The
star finished off her look with a stunning gold perfume 
bottle clutch bag that coordinated with the metallic trim on her dress 
perfectly.
