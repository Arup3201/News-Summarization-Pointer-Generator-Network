Two-time winner Padraig Harrington has been preparing for the The Open... by practicing blindfolded.

The double Claret Jug champion will be looking to make it a hat-trick of victories on Sunday having triumphed in 2007 and 2008.

But his preparation has been slightly unorthodox. Harrington, with the help of caddie Ronan Flood, tries to hole a shot from 135 yards whilst blindfolded.

His first effort, as part of a promotion for sponsors HSBC, is a complete air shot, he makes contact on his second and hits a tree yards away with his third.

But with Flood guiding, Harrington eventually starts to find the green before eventually managing to make the seemingly impossible shot.

Padraig Harrington will start his first round at Hoylake on Thursday at 9.15am with 2011 Masters winner Charl Schwartzel and Korea's KJ Cho.
