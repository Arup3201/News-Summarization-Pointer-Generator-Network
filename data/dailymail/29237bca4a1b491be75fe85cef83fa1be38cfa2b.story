He may be laying low for six months.

But disgraced Nightly News anchor Brian Williams couldn't escape ridicule in one of the biggest comedy events in TV history.

On the red carpet for Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary Jim Carrey alarmed Today newscaster Matt Lauer when he bluntly asked: 'Where are you hiding Brian Williams?' 

Tina Fey's eyes widened and Savannah Guthrie squealed during an awkward pause before Lauer exclaimed: 'Look at the time!'

And during the three-hour episode, Jerry Seinfeld took to the stage to say: 'I just found out one of the original cast members was Brian Williams. I don't know if that's true... doesn't sound true.'

Jerry Seinfeld took to the stage to say: 'I just found out one of the original cast members was Brian Williams. I don't know if that's true...'

Awkward! Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie maintained smiles but Tina Fey turned awkwardly as Jim Carrey asked about Brian Williams

Awkward moment: Carrey demanded to know where the disgraced Nightly News host is

Williams, who has been suspended for six months without pay for allegedly fabricating anecdotes, is the only news anchor to have hosted the show.

But happily for Williams, the jokes at his expense were barely a fraction of the material on Sunday evening.

Musicians, actors, and politicians alike lined up on the red carpet to tell Lauer, Gutherie, Al Roker and Carson Daly how much they love the show.  

And the first joke of the night came when Kanye West spoofed himself at the end of the red carpet by interrupting the hosts as they wrapped up. 

Williams, who has been suspended for allegedly fabricating anecdotes, is the only news anchor to have hosted the show. He is pictured here with Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers during weekend update in 2007

On again: Here he played the character of Carl Bacon alongside Kristen Wiig as Cheryl Bryant in 2007

Presenters: Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake opened the show on Sunday, as they have done many times

'Oh Kanye!': The Today show hosts exclaimed as Kanye West interrupted their closing comments in an apparent spoof of himself

Other stars: Robert De Niro (left) hailed the show as iconic and Sarah Palin (right) said her appearance was the best part of her 2008 campaign

Heavyweight guest: Donald Trump, pictured with wife Melania, told Carson Daly he is 'honored' to be attending the historic event

Seth Meyers attributed the success of the show to creator Lorne Michaels' 'good taste'.

In a moving tribute, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani remembered the show's first post-9/11 show as 'one of the most patriotic moments for this show, maybe for America.'

Sarah Palin spoke alongside Alec and Hilaria Baldwin to hail the show as a center for 'the most intelligent and comedic minds in America in one place.'

She appeared on the show in 2008, during her presidential campaign, beside a lookalike version of herself played by Tina Fey.

In a nod to that episode, she told Lauer and Guthrie: 'If this is indicative of the campaign it was the most fun moment of the campaign.'

Musical opening: Jimmy and Justin danced and sang to open the episode before screaming 'Live in New York it's Saturday night!'

Honoring hosts: After the opening credits rolled, Steve Martin came out for a monologue and was joined by Chris Rock and Miley Cyrus

Palin was stood with Alec Baldwin, with whom she shared an awkward cold open in 2008. 

Baldwin said: 'We get to relax and have fun regardless of people’s politics. And I often think, if only Lorne Michaels could produce the Congress, maybe we’d have more fun and we would get more done.'

Donald Trump told Daly he is 'honored' to be attending the historic event. 

Despite suggestions to the contrary, former cast member Chevy Chase, who first pioneered the Weekend Update news spoof segment, turned up. 

Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake opened the episode with a musical number and the words: 'Live in New York it's Saturday night!'

Steve Martin followed.

Opening the show, he said: 'Tonight is like an enormous high school reunion, a high school that is almost all white.

'Tonight we’re going to honor pay tribute to those greats who are no longer with us,' before naming John Belushi and Gilda Radner - as well as Jon Lovitz who was stood there shaking his head.
