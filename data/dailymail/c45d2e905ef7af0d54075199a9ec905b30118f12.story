Ismael Bouzid has set his sights on winning a deal at Rangers after clocking in for a trial at Murray Park.

The Algerian central defender reported for the first day of pre-season training along with the rest of the squad and hopes to prove his worth to manager Ally McCoist in the coming days.

The 30-year-old joined Kilmarnock this time last year yet only played in four games under Allan Johnston.

Trial: Ismael Bouzid trains in pre-season with Rangers and hopes to prove his worth to manager Ally McCoist

The player’s first experience of Scottish football came during a two-year stint with Hearts between 2009 and 2011.

Signed by Csaba Laszlo, Bouzid struggled in his first season at Tynecastle with an eventual seventh-place finish costing the manager his job at the turn of the year.

Bouzid was a much improved player under Jim Jefferies, however, and was a mainstay of the side which finished third in 2010-11.

Moves to Greek side Giannina and Algerian outfit USM Alger pre-empted a move back to Scotland with Killie last summer but it proved to be a largely frustrating experience.

Bouzid, who played with Lee Wallace, Ian Black and David Templeton during his time at Hearts, hopes to extent his trial to Rangers’ tour of the Highlands next week.

McCoist’s men head north on Tuesday before facing Buckie Thistle and Brora Rangers.

The Ibrox side will then travel to North America from July 12 for a four-game tour.

McCoist has already added Kenny Miller and Darren McGregor to his squad but has yet to finalise a deal for Kris Boyd.
