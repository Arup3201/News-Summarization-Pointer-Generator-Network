Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann's White House bid has been thrown into doubt after a staff exodus, including her pollster and senior adviser, has led to questions about her campaign finances.

Pollster Ed Goeas plans to leave the campaign after upcoming debates in New Hampshire and Nevada, and senior adviser Andy Parrish is returning to the Minnesota congresswoman's office where he served as chief of staff.

The latest staff changes follow four previous resignations from Mrs Bachmann's campaign team.

She is now trailing in seventh place in a new opinion poll of public support for Republican presidential candidates.

Maybe even more than the Republicans, President Barack Obama is looking forward to the GOP picking a candidate to challenge him.

For now and months to come, Mr Obama is an incumbent with no specific rival, a campaigner against various forces but not one in particular.

He is running against a staggering economy. And Congress. And himself - that history-making version of Mr Obama that many voters remember from 2008.

The longer it takes for Republicans to rally around a nominee, the more the election remains a referendum on Mr Obama and jobs.

That's not what the White House and his campaign eagerly want - a clear choice between the president and another candidate who holds starkly different views about how to improve the economy.

With polls showing his approval rating in the low 40s, Mr Obama even contended yesterday that he's the underdog.

'I don't mind - I'm used to being an underdog,' the president said in an interview with ABC News.

With no control over when he gets an opponent, Mr Obama is now waging what amounts to a proxy campaign against the eventual Republican nominee.

Every time he presents his jobs bill as a choice between helping the middle-class or protecting the ultra-rich, every time he tells Democratic donors that his opponents' approach to governing 'will fundamentally cripple America', he is previewing a campaign argument that he will apply against whoever his opponent is.

Republican insiders say their party's battle could extend into May - meaning Mr Obama would not have a specific challenger for more than seven months.

Alice Stewart, a Bachmann spokeswoman, 
said: 'Given the changing caucus and primary schedule, we will not be 
utilising full-time polling consultants and will concentrate heavily on 
retail politics in Iowa.

'Ed will work on several projects with us this month, then we shift focus to Iowa and he will shift to other projects not associated with the campaign.'

Mr Parrish's return to Minnesota follows a move to Iowa last summer to build support before the state's lead-off 2012 caucuses.

The moves signal an effort to preserve money three months ahead of the first Republican nominating contests.

Mrs Bachmann began July with about $3.6million (Â£2.3million), most of which had been transferred from her congressional campaign account.

She has struggled to match her vast reach among small-dollar givers with cheques near the $2,500 maximum donation. An update on her campaign's financial health is due by October 15.

In other staff changes, deputy press 
secretary Doug Sachtleben transferred back to the congressional office 
after only a couple months with the campaign. So has Mrs Bachmann's 
scheduler, Kimberley Rubin.

In
a statement released last night, Ms Stewart said the moves were part of
a long-standing strategy to 'shift people and resources as needed'.

She
said: 'We are adding staff in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to
meet the demands of the changing caucus and primary schedule.

'With Congress back in session, we have shifted some employees back to the congressional office to meet the demands there.'

Only last month, Mrs Bachmann's campaign manager Ed Rollins and his deputy stepped down.

Mr
Rollins cited health reasons and deputy David Polyansky attributed his 
departure to differences over the campaign's direction. Their exit came 
within weeks of the candidate's Iowa GOP straw poll victory.

After a strong start, numerous gaffes that earned her comparisons with that other hard-right conservative, Sarah Palin, Mrs Bachmann's standing in the race is starting to suffer.

She now stands as the seventh most popular Republican candidate.

A fall in support was first noticeable when Texas Governor Rick Perry announced his candidacy.

She
fell further in opinion polls after suggesting an unproven link between
vaccines and mental retardation while trying to criticise Governor 
Perry's executive order requiring young girls to get immunised for the 
human papillomavirus, a sexually spread virus that can cause cervical 
cancer.

Mitt Romney now leads the Republican race for the White House with 25 
per cent support for a consecutive month, according to a Washington 
Post/ABC News poll of the 2012 GOP presidential candidates.

A favourite among Tea Party supporters and evangelical voters, Mrs Bachmann is now betting her campaign on Iowa.

She
hopes a win there would propel her back into contention with national 
poll leaders Perry and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. 
She spent parts of yesterday in Iowa and will remain in the state today.

Mrs
Bachmann is midway through her third term in the House. She suspended 
her congressional campaign efforts when she announced for president but 
hasn't explicitly ruled out a re-election bid.

Mrs Bachmann's propensity for gaffes has earned her comparisons with fellow conservative Republican Sarah Palin (pictured), who has yet to enter the presidential race

She
would have until next June to decide, although many party insiders are 
doubtful that Mrs Bachmann will try to reclaim her seat.

Texas Governor Perry's popularity has fallen - he is now joint second 
alongside businessman Herman Cain now ties with 16 per cent.

Congressman Ron Paul is fourth with 11 per cent, while Mrs Bachmann 
trails at seventh where she ties with former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich.
