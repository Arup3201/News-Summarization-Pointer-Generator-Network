A woman has lost eight stone through dieting and exercise after she was compared to Emmerdale character Mandy Dingle.

For years, Julie Butler, 38, liked nothing better than a cosy night in and a takeaway with her husband Andy Butler, also 38. 

But the Southampton couple's evening habits caused her to eat her way to 18 stone.

Julie Butler, 38, from Southampton was upset after being compared to Emmerdale's curvy Mandy Dingle. She went on a diet and lost 7st 7lbs

When Julie was at her largest, at size 24, a stranger making jokes in her local pub remarked that she looked similar to ITV soap Emmerdale's larger-than-life character Mandy Dingle, played by actress Lisa Riley.

The mother-of-three was mortified by the remarks and made a vow to lose the pounds.

After cutting down her daily meals by thousands of calories, she has now lost 7st 7lbs. 

Her husband, who weighed 20 stone at his heaviest, was so inspired by his wife's diet that he decided to join her and has now shed six stone himself.

Julie said: 'The Mandy Dingle comparisons are now long gone. I feel so much happier and more confident in myself.'

The stay-at-home mother met her husband Andy shortly after she turned 18 and they pair married in 1998 when she weighed 13 stone.

Julie Butler and her husband Andy piled on the pounds after getting in the habit of eating takeaways every evening. The couple have since lost almost 14 stone between them 

Julie was slim until her late teens, when she swapped healthy eating and athletics for pub lunches and boozy nights.

But she finally lost control of her weight gain after she piled on extra weight throughout her three pregnancies. 

Now that her three children, Lewis, 14, Mitchell, 12 and Sophie, 9, are older, she decided the time was right to regain control of her diet. 

She said: 'I put on weight with each of my pregnancies - it was partly natural baby weight, but a lot of it was because I was eating unhealthily.'

'We fell into the habit of snuggling up on the sofa, eating takeaways and treating ourselves to chocolate and crisps.'

But it wasn't until Julie the incident in the pub where Julie was compared to Emmerdale's Mandy Dingle, who was played by Lisa Riley in the popular Yorkshire soap from 1995 to 2001, that she decided to bite the bullet.

She said: 'The comparison upset me because she is known for being big.

'Lisa Riley is a lovely woman and Mandy Dingle is a great, bubbly character - but I didn't like being compared to her size.

'At the time I wasn't bothered about my weight. I thought it was a part of who I am. But that comment stuck with me. 

'I started to worry about how large I was.'

While celebrating her 15th wedding anniversary in May 2013 with a burger and chips at T.G.I. Friday's, she put down her knife and fork and vowed to change her lifestyle.

She said: 'Both me and Andy realised we were not happy with our weight - both of us were the biggest we had ever been.

'Our health was suffering - I had irritable bowel syndrome and Andy had acid reflux. We decided, then and there, that we would sort our lives out.

'We both loved each other whether we were fat or thin, big or small, but both of us were unhappy with ourselves.'

The couple swapped fast food for lean meat and fresh fruit and vegetables and started calorie counting. They also went on 5k runs in their local park 

Mrs Butler signed up to her local Slimming World group and started attending weekly meetings. 

The couple swapped fast food for lean meat and fresh fruit and vegetables and started calorie counting.

Before beginning her weight loss Mrs Butler typically ate three slices of white toast with butter and marmalade followed by a cup of tea with biscuits for breakfast. 

For lunch she would have a ham and cheese sandwich, crisps and a chocolate bar. 

For dinner she ate a Domino's pizza with all the toppings, garlic bread, chicken strippers and wedges with dips. 

During the evening she would snack on Maltesers.

Today, Mrs Butler eats fruit and yoghurt with an omelette for breakfast, a jacket potato with ham and cottage cheese and a salad for lunch, and salmon stir-fry for dinner. 

Throughout the day she snacks on fresh fruit.

They also started taking part in weekly five-kilometre runs in their local park.

After embarking on a strict diet and exercise regime, Mrs Butler soon shrunk down to the 10st 7lb she is today, allowing her to fit into size 12 dresses

Soon Mrs Butler had shrunk down to the 10st 7lb she is today, allowing her to fit into size 12 dresses. 

Mr Butler, the manager of an electrical store, dropped from 20 stone to just 14 stone.

Mrs Butler said: 'I feel so much healthier and more confident. I think I look great.

'I loved losing weight with Andy - he looks amazing as well. 

I loved having the support of someone at home going through the same thing as me. I. couldn't have done it without him.

Andy and Julie supported each other throughout their weight loss with shared goals 

'I really appreciate going into shops and picking fashionable dresses straight off the rail, rather than having to dig through the XXL section.'

Mr Butler said: 'I feel like a different person. My life has completely changed in a good way.

'Before I lost weight I was at work all day and falling asleep after a couple of ciders at home. 

I didn't have enough energy to do anything with my kids.

'Now I come home and spend time with my children because I am full of energy - I feel like I can do anything.

'Julie and I had to make a lot of sacrifices, and I'm glad we were there for each other.'
