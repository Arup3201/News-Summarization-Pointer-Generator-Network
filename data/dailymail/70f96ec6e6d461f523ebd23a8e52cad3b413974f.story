Sacha Baron Cohen, pictured with his wife Isla Fisher, is allegedly one of many who face calls to pay back tax

Tory peers, celebrated comedians and a Treasury quango chief are among the latest big names who could receive hefty bills from the taxman for investing in potential tax avoidance schemes. 

Four of England’s Ashes-winning cricketers can also be revealed as among the backers of film and property financing funds that appeared to be legitimate investments but may now be challenged by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. 

Over the next few weeks up to 33,000 people who invested in the tax-saving schemes could receive letters warning them they may have to settle unpaid bills within 90 days – or risk being taken to court.

HMRC refuses to discuss individual cases but analysis of Companies House files suggests that  those who potentially face paying back thousands because of investments in contested schemes include:

• Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, the Tory peer and president of the supermarket chain.

• Lord Edmiston, the motor industry tycoon and Tory party donor.

• Banker Robin Budenberg who advised ministers in the credit crunch.

• Comedy stars Sacha Baron Cohen, David Baddiel and Neil Morrissey.

• BBC broadcaster Kate Adie.

• Former England cricket captains Michael Vaughan and David Gower, and 2005 Ashes heroes Paul Collingwood, Matthew Hoggard and Marcus Trescothick.  

All were encouraged by financial advisers to put money into schemes that would pay for movies to be made and buildings to be developed, giving them big tax breaks.

But HMRC now believes dozens of the investment vehicles were really just sophisticated tax dodges, as they allowed investors to get large refunds the year after they invested.

Also involved? Cricketer Michael Vaughan and Lord Sainsbury are said to have used tax-avoidance schemes

Last week HMRC published a list of 1,200 investment partnerships under scrutiny and said it would use new powers to claw back an estimated £7.1 billion of tax from the individuals and businesses that invested.

But the revelation that Tory peers and donors are among those facing repayment orders will embarrass David Cameron after he declared he was opposed to all ‘aggressive tax avoidance’.

Several of the contested schemes are known to be linked to film and games giant Ingenious Media, which claims to have helped fund blockbuster films such as Avatar and The Life Of Pi. 

Lord Sainsbury, Sacha Baron Cohen, Kate Adie and David Gower all invested in a scheme called Ingenious Film Partners 2, which also attracted David Beckham, TV stars Ant and Dec, and ex-Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell.

Lord Edmiston, who is worth an estimated £440m, is said to be on HMRC's list

DAVID GOWER

Finances: After retiring he was team captain on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It’s All Over before becoming Sky’s main cricket presenter.

None of the scheme investors contacted by The Mail on Sunday responded to requests for comment except for Gower who said his investment was legal.

‘HMRC are now changing the goalposts,’ he added.

In a separate move, Ingenious has written to thousands of its own investors telling them HMRC will let them settle their tax bills early, but for a limited time only.

This is understood to affect investors of the ‘Inside Track’ schemes, among them Budenburg, Baddiel and cricketers Vaughan, Collingwood, Hoggard and Trescothick.  

All may claim to have made legitimate investments that were encouraged by the previous government, after Gordon Brown introduced tax breaks for investors in order to boost Britain’s film industry.

Those who put money into films would have their investments matched or even doubled by the scheme’s managers, but they were allowed tax relief on the total investment.

Those who put their money into films, potentially including Neil Morrissey, would have their investments matched or even doubled by scheme's managers, but would be allowed tax relief on the total figure

So if a celebrity paid in £100,000 it would be topped up to £300,000 – and they could write off the entire sum as a loss against their income the following year, cutting their tax bills substantially.

In this way it has been possible to defer tax payments for up to 15 years.

But since 2010 HMRC has been investigating many of the schemes over fears they were simply being used to avoid tax.

A
 spokesman for Ingenious Films insisted: ‘Ingenious film partnerships 
are not tax avoidance schemes and were never designed to be.

The BBC’s flagship current affairs programme Newsnight had a big story last week about public figures including Andrew Mitchell MP who had invested in alleged tax avoidance schemes.

But it failed to mention that among the backers of a similar scheme run by the same company, the Inside Track film financing partnerships, was Jeremy Paxman.

The BBC said: Our report focused only on MPs and peers.’

'They are commercial film production partnerships that have funded films including Avatar, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, life of Pi and Hot Fuzz.

‘They have already generated more than £1billion of film income for the partnerships which is taxable in the UK. Ingenious is looking forward to demonstrating this at a Tax Tribunal in November. Ingenious does not and cannot advise investors on its film partnerships.’

Another scheme on the list of HMRC targets is Cobalt Data Centre 2 and 3, which funded a business estate near Newcastle – invested in by leading football figures including Wayne Rooney and Roy Hodgson. Lord Edmiston can now also be named as a member of this scheme, investing more than £250,000.

Financial Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke said: ‘Accelerated payments will tackle the small minority of taxpayers who are currently able to put off paying tax, sometimes for several years.’

Claims management firm Rebus, is acting on behalf of investors suing financial advisers for ‘mis-selling’ the schemes.

A spokesman said: ‘The one thing they all have in common is their professional adviser failed to be clear as to the risks they would face when they invested in, sometimes multiple, tax avoidance schemes. Many now face severe financial hardship.’
