Former minister Paul Goggins was today hailed by Labour leader Ed Miliband as ‘one of our best’ as mourners gathered for his funeral.

Mr Goggins, a former Northern Ireland and Home Office minister, died last week after collapsing while out jogging over Christmas.

Dozens of family, friends and politicians gathered for the funeral service at Salford Cathedral, including Mr Miliband, shadow ministers Ed Balls, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham and Commons Speaker John Bercow.

Mr Goggins, 60, was rushed to hospital
 after falling ill near his Salford home on December 30, where doctors 
diagnosed a brain haemorrhage.

He was placed on a life support machine but died last Tuesday night, with his family at his bedside.

He leaves behind his wife of 36 years, Wyn, 59, and three children, Matthew, 33, Theresa, 31, and Dominic, 28.

Only
 family members spoke during today’s service, but in speaking earlier Mr
 Miliband paid tribute to the late MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East in 
Greater Manchester.

Mr Miliband said: ‘Paul was a family 
man, a man of deep faith and one of the kindest, most decent people I 
have ever had the privilege of meeting.

‘A
 life-long member of the Labour Party, his deeply-held principles and 
firm conviction shone throughout his career as social worker, 
councillor, MP and minister. He earned the respect, trust and affection 
of all communities while serving as a minister for Northern Ireland.

‘He
 was one of our own and one of our best. My deepest condolences - and 
those of the entire Labour movement - go to his wife, Wyn, to his 
children, Matthew, Theresa and Dominic.’

John
 Hayes, minister without portfolio, represented Prime Minister David 
Cameron at the funeral and Graham Brady, Conservative MP for Altrincham 
and Sale West, also attended.

Mr Goggins, who held the Greater Manchester seat of Wythenshawe and Sale East with a majority of 7,575 in 2010, served as minister of state for Northern Ireland and had previously been in the Home Office.

As a young man, Mr Goggins studied at a Roman Catholic seminary but decided against entering the priesthood. Instead he became a social worker before being elected as MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East in 1997.

He quickly became widely liked and admired by both colleagues and constituents for his dedicated work and served in a number of posts in Westminster, including at the Home Office and as Northern Ireland minister.

Since 2010 he had been a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, overseeing the work of the UK's spies.

Mr Goggins was also well-known as a keen runner and fundraiser and campaigned for compensation for the victims of asbestos-caused cancer.

Mr Goggins also co-founded the all party parliamentary group Friends of Cafod and was an unpaid board member at the Catholic aid agency for England and Wales between 1998 and 2003.
