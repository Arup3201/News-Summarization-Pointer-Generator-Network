SportsmailÂ columnist Jamie Redknapp enjoyed a glittering football career before injuries forced him to retire at the age of 31.

The midfielder starred for 11 years at Liverpool following a two-year spell at Bournemouth - where he began his professional career at the age of 16.

Following his time at Anfield, Redknapp moved to Tottenham where he scored four goals in almost three years at the club.

The 17-time capped England midfielder moved to Southampton during the January transfer window of the 2004-05 season in what proved to be his final campaign due to constant injury problems and on the advice of his medical specialists.

The Redknapp's are joined by Marvin and Rochelle Humes as well as couple Rik Edwards and Emer Kenny in the #PANDORAwishes campaign.
