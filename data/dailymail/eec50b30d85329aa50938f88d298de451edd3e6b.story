Questions: Police have said there was no evidence of foul play, and are awaiting autopsy and toxicology results

There were no witnesses involved, police spokesman Dwight Mitchell said in a statement, and on Wednesday officials said Cogswell's death was likely caused by an overdose.

Police are waiting for the results of a toxicology test to confirm the cause of death, which could take between 60 and 90 days.

Cogswell, who tranferred from the University of Arizona a year ago to be a part of the University of Louisville's cheerleading program, was described by the university's sports information director Kenny Klein as an 'elite athlete.'

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requires regular drug testing for college athletes, but cheerleading is not part of the association and therefore team members do not undergo drug screenings, Klein told the Louisville Courier-Journal

'Obviously we're devastated at the loss of Dani,' Klein said at a media conference.'She
 was clearly, as you've seen from the photographs that are circulating, 
beautiful on the outside but that paled in comparison to her inner 
beauty. She was incredibly talented.'At
 the University of Louisville, as most people know, our spirit program 
is nationally and world-renowned. And Dani absolutely fit the bill for 
one of our elite athletes. She is definitely at an elite status within 
an elite program. She was on the upper echelon of our program here.'
