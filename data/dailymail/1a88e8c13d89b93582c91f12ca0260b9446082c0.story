Arrested: Darlene Jo Lewis was arrested on suspicion of having stolen $8,900 from her daughter's Girl Scout troop

The former treasurer of a Girl Scout troop stole $9,800 from the group and spent some of it on a dating service for seniors, police say.

Darlene Jo Lewis allegedly stole the four-figure sum from Georgia's Girl Scout Troop 798 in Douglasville, which her daughter attended.

Police in Douglasville, GA, where she was the troop's treasurer from 2010-2012, believe that the loss of money means the Scout troop will now have to close.

Lewis, 49, who was arrested on 
Friday, is said to have spent the money on gifts, on her son, and also 
on a dating service for seniors.

Lewis faces felony theft by taking charges and is being held at the Douglas County Jail.

Meanwhile
two Girl Scout groups on the other side of the country have fallen 
victim to a hoaxer who placed an order for thousands of dollars' worth 
of cookies - and then failed to pay up.

Someone posing as an employee of a large corporation placed an order for $24,000 of cookies from the Scout troops in Portland, Oregon, raising the girls' hopes of making enough 'cookie credits' to attend summer camp.

The girls ordered the 6,000 cookies requested, but when the time came for the person who made the order to pay up, it became apparent that the Scouts had been hoaxed.

Luckily, however, word about the cruel prank spread, and crowds descended on the Girl Scouts' headquarters wanting to purchase the over-ordered cookies.

One woman even drove down from 
Vancouver to hand over her money for the cookies, saying the hoax was a 
'dirty trick' to play on the young girls.

They sold all their cookies and said they were taken aback by the kindness of strangers.
