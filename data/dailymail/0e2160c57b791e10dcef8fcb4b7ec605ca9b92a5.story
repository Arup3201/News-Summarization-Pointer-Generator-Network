A Texas federal judge has accused the Department of Homeland Security of delivering children smuggled into the United States to their illegal immigrant parents.

U.S. District Judge Andrew S Hanen filed a court order late last week claiming that in more than one case before his court, immigration officials had arrested human traffickers and then delivered the children being smuggled 'to the custody of the parent illegally living in the United States.'

This action makes the DHS complicit in aiding that Mexican drug cartels that control the people smuggling rings, says Hanen, adding that the 'government is not only allowing [illegal immigrants in the U.S.] to fund the illegal and evil activities of these cartels, but is also inspiring them to do so.'

Reunited: Judge Hanen says the DHS is reuniting children with their illegal immigrant parents in the U.S. after intercepting people smugglers

The court order containing Hanen's accusations was filed against Mirtha Veronica Nava-Martinez who attempted to smuggle a 10-year-ol El Salvadorean girl to the U.S. where her mother is living illegally.

The child's mother Patricia Elizabeth Salmeron Santos has 'solicited human traffickers to smiggle' her daughter from El Salvador to Virginia where she was living.

'The criminal conspiracy instigated by Salmeron Santos was temporarily interrupted when Nava-Martinez was arrested,' wrote Hanen. 'Despite this setback, the goal of the conspiracy was successfully completed thanks to the actions of the United States Government.'

Despite knowing that Salmeron Santos had instigated the illegal conduct, she was not arrested but gained the outcome she had desired, says Hanen: 'the DHS delivered the child to her - thus successfully completing the mission of the criminal conspiracy.'

Judge Hanen noted that it was the fourth such case to come before his court in as many weeks.

Danger: Hanen wrote that if the DHS continues to 'choose not to enforce U.S. law' it places children in danger and costs U.S. taxpayers money

Hanen accused the Obama Administration of allowing illegal immigrants to avoid deportationÂ  and 'chosen not to enfore the United States' border security laws,' he wrote.

Hanen wrote that his court is 'quite concerned with the apparent policy of the Department of Homeland Security of completing mission of individuals who are violating the border security of the United States.'

In addition to aiding and abetting people smugglers, Hanen wrote, the DHS is costing U.S. taxpayers money in the form of travel and accommodations to get the children to their parents and in one case 'flew a child to multiple locations.'

A common occurrence: The Texas judge said the case of Salmeron Santos was one of four that had come through his court in as many weeks

Fox News reports that in the case of Salmeron Santos, a federal prosecutor requested that the mother be placed in immigration proceedings but that it's unclear whether or not that has happened.

Hanen also noted that he is 'not unsympathetic' to the plight of the parents and children in these cases, but that it is the children who are at risk if the DHS continues to allow smuggled children to be reunited with their parents.

He wrote that while some are transported across the border in cars, others are 'made to swim the Rio Grande or other bodies of water in remote areas.'

'These entities [drug cartels] are not known for their concern for human life,' Hanen wrote.

'They do not hire bonded childcare providers to smuggle children. By fostering an atmosphere whereby illegal aliens are encouraged to pay human smugglers for further services, the Government is not only allowing them to fund the illegal and evil activities of these cartels, but is also inspiring them to do so.'
