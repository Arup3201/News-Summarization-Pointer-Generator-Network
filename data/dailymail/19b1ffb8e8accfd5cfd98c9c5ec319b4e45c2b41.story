A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer who was forced to hand over his uniform after he smoked medical marijuana for PTSD while wearing it has taken his own life.

Corporal Ronald Francis, a father-of-four and 21-year veteran of the force in New Brunswick, died on Monday afternoon. His cause of death has not been released.

Last year, he had appeared in an interview with CBC and smoked  marijuana while wearing his red serge uniform, explaining that it helped the post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his job.

'I get up in the morning, have my coffee and the marijuana. I go at lunchtime, have a marijuana joint, and then again in the evening. That would be my medical regime,' he said.

Suicide: Corporal Ronald Francis, 43, took his life on Monday. He is pictured in an interview with CBC News last year, in which he smoked medical marijuana which had been prescribed for his work-related PTSD

Reliant: He smoked upto 15 joints a day - but his bosses said he could not do it while wearing his uniform

'I'm still functional, but your nervous system is relaxed, and that makes a big difference.'

In the interview, he explained that every time he saw a black mat on the ground it would trigger flashbacks of him returning after a gruesome job and wiping brains from his boots.

Francis said he was first prescribed anti-depressants by doctors when he developed signs of mental stress but noted no improvement.

After being prescribed the marijuana, the corporal smoked three grams - or up to 15 joints - a day.

But his bosses said smoking in his uniform sent mixed messages to the public about drug use. Recreational marijuana is illegal in Canada.

RCMP Deputy Commissioner Gilles Moreau said officers with a medical marijuana prescription could take their medication but he said they shouldn't use it while in uniform in public. 

Emotional: After sparking the public debate, the 21-year veteran of the force returned his red serge uniform

Upset: He sobbed as he was filmed handing over the uniform. He was still on leave at the time of his death

Francis was put on restricted duties while on the drug and was not allowed to carry a firearm or drive a patrol car. 

Francis countered that he wanted employers to better understand the importance of medical marijuana. He argued that it was a PTSD issue rather than about taking drugs.  

'I'm trying to draw attention to the fact that the RCMP fails to have a program in place for proper [PTSD] screening for their members and proper information for their families,' he told the National Post at the time. 'People are dying, they're committing suicide because there's no proper backup.' 

Francis was eventually ordered to turn in his uniforms. He was captured sobbing on camera as he arrived to hand them over. 

In December 6 last year, he allegedly punched and shoved two RCMP officers who had confronted him in an effort to take him to hospital for a mental-health assessment.

A few weeks later, he allegedly assaulted two other officers in Oromocto after they arrested him for breaching the terms of his probation by drinking alcohol, the National Post reported.

He was later charged with assault and breaching an undertaking to not possess or consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs.

He pleaded guilty to three counts before his trial was to begin and the other charges were dropped. His sentencing was scheduled for November 3.

Concerns: In an interview after he was put on leave, Corporal Francis said he feared for his health

He was still on medical leave from the RCMP at the time of his death. He was 43. 

Chief Gabriel Atwin of Kingsclear First Nation spoke about the loss on Monday night, CBC reported.

'It's a tragic, tragic event,' he said. 'Tragic loss to our community. Ron was not only a good friend of mine, and a great community member, but also a family member of mine. It's a tragic event.'

A Facebook group, Families of the RCMP for PTSD Awareness, posted a tribute to Francis.

'Our hearts go out to Ron, who struggled for so long, his family who journeyed with him, and all those who knew, worked with and loved him, all of whom are struggling to deal with the aftermath of suicide,' it read.

'Please know that we at Families of the RCMP for PTSD Awareness are devastated and we are working tirelessly to do all we can to stop these tragedies from occurring.'
