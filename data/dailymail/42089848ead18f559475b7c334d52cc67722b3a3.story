The tour promoter for sea shanty group Fisherman’s Friends was killed and a band member seriously injured when a metal door fell on them at a concert venue.

Paul McMullen and Trevor Grills were believed to have been unloading gear for a gig when the tragedy occurred at G Live in Guildford, Surrey, on Saturday morning.

Mr McMullen, 44, suffered serious leg injuries. He was treated by paramedics but died at the scene.

Mr Grills, 54, sustained serious head injuries and was last night in a critical condition in St George’s Hospital, Tooting, South London.

Tragic: Band promoter Paul McMullen was killed when a door fell on him at G Live venue in Guildford

The sea shanty group were given a £1m recording contract after being discovered by music industry bosses during a pub concert

Saturday night’s concert by the ten-piece Cornwall-based act, who sang When The Boat Comes In for a Young’s seafood advert on TV, was cancelled.

The Health and Safety Executive has been informed of the tragedy.

It is believed the nine singers not involved in the accident have returned  home to north Cornwall.

All of the Fisherman’s Friends, who have performed in Port Isaac for more than 15 years, are or were fishermen, coastguards or lifeboatmen.

Tributes were paid last night to Mr McMullen, who is thought to have been married and a father. In a statement Darcus Beese, president of the group’s label, Island Records, said: ‘Everyone here is shocked by this tragic event, our hopes and prayers go out to the friends and families of those involved.’

A spokesman for a group, Said The Maiden, who had worked with the singers, said: ‘We are deeply saddened by the news. Paul was an amazing man, who gave us a fabulous opportunity to sing for the Fisherman’s Friends.

'We feel honoured and grateful to have been able to work with him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the guys.’

There were more tributes on social media sites. Bekki Vousden said: ‘Was a pleasure knowing and working with such a lovely guy, my heart goes out to your family.’

Performer Davina Lines wrote: ‘Your family and friends will miss you very much. You were a top bloke.’

It is believed Mr McMullen, of Disley, Stockport, had been touring with the band for several months.

Tributes have begun pouring in on social media sites including Facebook and Twitter.

On Facebook, Mr McMullen's sister Sarah McMullen paid an emotional tribute to her brother.

She said: 'As a family we are in shock and devastated. Paul loved you and was very proud of the fact that he worked with you.

'Please keep singing, and sing one for him as soon as you are able.'

Friend Jacqueline O’Connor said: 'As a neighbour and foremost a friend for seven years I can certainly say my life has been enriched for knowing Paul McMullen.

'Always a delight, nothing to dislike, a good person to the core...one of life’s treasures that will be sorely missed.'

The sea shanty group were given a £1m recording contract after being discovered by music industry bosses during a pub concert.

They have since performed at the Glastonbury Festival.

Ealing Studios has also been working on developing a film charting the rise of the a capella group.

It is believed the nine members of the group not involved in the accident have since returned to their homes in north Cornwall.

A statement from G Live said: 'This is a terribly sad day and our thoughts are with the family of the deceased at this incredibly difficult time. '

The venue’s main hall is home to the prestigious International Orchestral Concert Series, which features the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and London Symphony Orchestra among its concerts.

It also holds children’s shows and community activities as well as conferences, business events and is home to a restaurant and cafe.

Surrey Police is investigating and the 
Health and Safety Executive - which investigates work-based accidents - 
has been notified.

The £26m G Live building was designed as a 'state-of-the-art' venue and hosts music, dance and comedy shows.

In recent months it has played host to a number of well-known acts including the Russian State Ballet and indie band The Kaiser Chiefs.

Acts due to play at the venue include Jools Holland and The Stranglers.

The 1,700 capacity venue was hailed as a 'local landmark' by councillors when it opened in 2011.

Speaking at its opening, Mayor of Guildford Councillor Terence Patrick said: 'The state-of-the-art venue realises our vision for a vibrant, dynamic space for the community.

'It will give a boost to the local economy and is part of our strong commitment to the arts and leisure.'
