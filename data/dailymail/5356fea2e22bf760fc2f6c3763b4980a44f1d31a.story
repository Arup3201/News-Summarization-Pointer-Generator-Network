As the back-and-forth continues over Apple and Samsung's trial on patent infringement, one thing aside from many others is evident: Judge Lucy Koh is over it.

Responding to a 75-page briefing presented by Apple before Samsung's closing arguments in San Jose, California on Thursday, Koh released on their suggested offering of 22 rebuttal witnesses.

'Ridiculous .... unless you're smoking crack, you know these witnesses aren't going to be called,' Koh retorted according to The Verge.

'First, your honor, I'm not smoking crack. I can promise you that,' Apple attorney William Lee replied.

The legal team said they would slim down their document adding having truly believed they would be able to bring all their witnesses to the stand in the trial's remaining time.

'I'm billing time because you all are being unreasonable,' Koh told both parties with her upset.

The courtroom's high emotion is of little unfamiliarity with the smartphone and tablet designers' on-going battle over alleged stolen designs rolling since 2011.

In the biography of Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs, he heatedly vowed with his 'last dying breath' he would destroy Google's Android.

'I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,' he said.

'I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.'

'Everyone is out there with that basic form factor,' Samsung attorney Charles Verhoeven said last month in court over the accusations of design theft. 'There is nothing wrong with looking at what your competitors do and being inspired by them.'

Apple has since filed a $2.5 billion patent infringement case against Samsung which uses Google's Android operating system.

In response, Samsung counter sued them for approximately $400 million in claimed damages to reputation and $22 million in royalties.

The evidence stage of the trial ended on Friday with only final arguments by both sides remaining and set for Tuesday before a decision in the multibillion-dollar case will be made.
