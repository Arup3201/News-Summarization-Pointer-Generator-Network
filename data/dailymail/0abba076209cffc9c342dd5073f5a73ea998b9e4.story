Possessive: John Yates has been found guilty of killing his wife and driving her body to a police base where he handed himself in

A violent and jealous man who killed his estranged wife before driving her body in the boot of his car to a police traffic base has been found guilty of her murder. 

Barbara Yates, a 49-year-old mother-of-two, was looking forward to her 50th birthday when she was killed by John Yates, 58, of Padgate, Warrington. 

The violence and abuse Mr Yates showed towards his wife went back 30 years, Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales heard. 

According to prosecuting barrister Wyn Lloyd Jones, Mrs Yates had told her sister that her husband had once locked her in a cupboard. 

In 1987, she was admitted to hospital after he allegedly punched her repeatedly, tried to strangle her and banged her head on a car dashboard. 

But in 2009, Mrs Yates decided she couldn't take anymore and finally left her abusive husband.

But he was jealous of her new life. 

In 2011 she was taken to hospital after a 'prolonged assault' by him.

At one stage he allegedly got a hammer and hit her over the head. 

Mrs Yates, a taxi escort for disabled children, had also described how her husband went berserk after being refused sex.

But she withdrew a complaint against him.

Seven months later, on July 18, she was killed. 

Controlling and possessive Yates told the jury how he headbutted, strangled, punched and stamped on Mrs Yates in the Warrington area.

It is still not known exactly where she died.

'I don't know the sequence of events, I lost my head.' he said.

He disputed touching her in an intimate area during the attack and insisted he didn't kill his wife, who was a parent governor at a special school, because she wanted a divorce.

Torture: Barbara Yates was tormented for 30 years by her violent husband

Following the killing he drove her body in the boot of his Peugeot 306 estate to a police traffic base 45 miles away at St Asaph where he handed himself in.

The cause of death was severe blunt force head, face and neck injuries. A hand may have been put over her mouth during the attack.

Yates had been on police bail following an incident 13 days earlier when he stole 35 pairs of shoes and a new dress from her home.

Grim: John Yates drove his wife's body to a police traffic base 45 miles away in St Asaph

Guilty: Yates had admitted the manslaughter of his wife but a jury took just two hours to find him guilty of her murder before he drove her body to a police base

Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told Yates: 'You have been convicted on overwhelming evidence of the murder of Barbara Yates your wife and partner of over 30 years.

'You have denied her murder but admitted her killing. There is only one sentence that I can pass which will be of life imprisonment.'

The minimum term will be determined at a sentencing hearing next month.

Yates had admitted the manslaughter of his wife but a jury took just two hours to find him guilty of her murder which he denied. 

Speaking outside court Cathryn Huddlestone, who had the grim task of identifying her sister's body, said: 'He is a brutal, brutal animal. He shouldn't be free to roam after what he did to my sister.

'I can't believe he could have that much anger and jealousy. If he loved her he should have let her get along with her life.'

Another sister, Angela Hyland, said : 'He controlled her and abused her mentally and physically and tried to get rid of her body like garbage.

'Barbara wanted a life of her own but he wouldn't allow it. He was a controlling monster.'
