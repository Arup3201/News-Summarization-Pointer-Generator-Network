More Americans than ever before believe global warming isn't happening, a new study has found.

The Yale Project on Climate Change Communication study found the number has risen to 23 percent, up 7 percentage points since April 2013.

The latest survey, taken in November 2013, finds that the majority of Americans — 63 percent — do believe in climate change, and 53 percent are 'somewhat' or 'very' worried about the consequences.

Climate change protesters on Capitol Hill: Despite protests, more the number of Americans who do not believe in global warming is rising.

'The great majority of climate scientists have concluded that global warming is happening, mostly human caused and, if left unchecked, will have serious consequences for human societies and the natural world,' the report's authors said.

'Yet, over the years, there has been considerable confusion within the American public about the level of scientific agreement on the subject.'

The study, conducted in November, found About two in three Americans (63%) believe global warming is happening.

'Relatively few – only 23 percent – believe it is not,' they said.

'The proportion who believe global warming is real has remained steady since Spring 2013.

'However, the proportion who do not believe global warming is happening has increased 7 percentage points since Spring 2013.

'The proportion of Americans who say they 'don’t know' whether or not global warming is happening has dropped 6 points – from 20 to 14 – since Spring of 2013.

The researchers also say Americans believe that even if it exists, global warming is not their problem.

'Over years of research, we have consistently found that, on average, Americans view global warming as a threat distant in space and time – a risk that will affect far away places, other species, or future generations more than people here and now,' the report says.

'We still find this same pattern, in which fewer than half of Americans (38%) believe they personally will be harmed a 'moderate amount' or a 'great deal' by global warming.

'People who prior said don’t know are increasingly saying they don't believe it,' said Anthony Leiserowitz, who led the study.

He told Livescience media coverage surrounding the release of the IPCC report in September may be the explanation for the shift.

While the report made a strong case for human-caused climate change, the majority of global media coverage focused on the question of whether there has been a "pause" in global warming.

'Media frames can be really important in shaping the way people interpret the news,' he said.

The findings divide Americans into six distinct subsets. Sixteen percent are "alarmed," sure global warming is happening and concerned about it.

On the opposite end of the spectrum are the "dismissive," who comprise about 15 percent of the public and who almost all see global warming as a conspiracy theory or hoax.

Changing either of these two groups' opinions about climate change is nearly impossible, the report found.
