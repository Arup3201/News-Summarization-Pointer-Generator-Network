Film star Sean Connery is urging fellow Scots to vote for independence when a referendum is held in September.

The longtime independence advocate says in The Sun on Sunday newspaper that the opportunity to separate from the rest of Britain is too good an opportunity to miss.

The 83-year-old says independence would galvanise the film and creative industries, creating new jobs in Scotland.

Connery, who was born in Edinburgh but no longer lives in Scotland, said the decision should be made by the people who choose to live and work there.

He said a vote for independence would bring renewed focus on Scottish culture, heritage and creative excellence.

His view is not shared by rock star David Bowie, who has urged Scottish voters to remain part of the United Kingdom at the Brit Awards.

Prime Minister David Cameron revealed that he ‘let out a cry of joy’ when the music legend used his acceptance speech at the Brit Awards last week to urge: ‘Scotland, stay with us.’

she collected his award for best male artist.

In the past Connery, who now lives in the Bahamas and also has a home in Marbella, Spain, hinted he may return to his home country, which he left in the 1950s, after previously saying he would only consider moving back if there was an end to the Union.

The actor has praised Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond and the work of the SNP government since it came into power in May 2007.

He wrote: 'I've always been hopeful about Scotland's prospects. And I now believe more than ever that Scotland is within touching distance of achieving independence and equality.'

He adds that the first step towards this was winning Scotland's parliament in 1997.

The second, the actor says, was electing an SNP Government last year.

He added: 'I believe we have what it takes to take the third step, and I am convinced it will happen in my lifetime.'

In 1997, Sir Sean claimed he rejected a knighthood from Labour because of his support for the SNP. In what was decribed as a 'spectacular U-turn', he became Sir Sean in the 2000 New Year's Honours List.
