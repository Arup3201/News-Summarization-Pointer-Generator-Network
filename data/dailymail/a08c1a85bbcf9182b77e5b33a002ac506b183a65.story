Father Christmas will be sitting pretty this Christmas after swapping his tired wooden sledge for this high-tech 'super sleigh'.

The £200,000 ($313,000) carriage comes complete with built-in GPS navigation, parking sensors and a chimney camera.

It also features a bulletproof Lexan polycarbonate front window, a convertible roof and a built-in nose wiper for Santa's magical reindeer.

And more presents could get delivered this year as Rudolph and his friends will have access to hybrid-powered rocket boosters when they are running low on energy.

Other features include an e-reader mount for easy access to the naughty-and-nice list, a mistletoe air freshener and a cup warmer with hot chocolate.

The concept Gadget Sleigh 900 (GS-900) has been designed by Metals4U in Pontefract, West Yorkshire in time for Christmas Eve.

'We just felt like Santa deserved a bit of an upgrade,' said customer service operative, Michael Ward said: 'His old wooden sleigh is a little bit dated and we wanted to bring him into the 21st century.'

'The rocket boosters can give the reindeer a hand too if they get tired.'

The sleigh is streamlined, for maximum efficiency and, for the first time ever, Santa can now listen to festive tunes on his travels, with the integrated sound system.

According to science, the speed at which the reindeers fly will cause them to burst into flames almost immediately after taking flight

He's making a list, and checking it twice, to find out who has been naughty and nice.

But Santa might also want to jot down a few equations and sums, as he'll need to grapple with the laws of physics come Christmas Eve.

Of course, it's unlikely Santa has to deal with the rules of science in quite the same way as regular people, but he might want to take a glance or two at the task awaiting him on his trip this year.

For starters, assuming that Santa doesn't handle certain faiths, he'll have about 378 million children to deliver to in a fairly short time frame, according to one scientist. That means he has 822.6 visits per second to cope with, requiring a stay of about one thousandth of a second to deliver presents to each home. 

All in all, Santa's sleigh will need to move about 650 miles (1,050km) per second, which is 3,000 times the speed of sound or 0.35 per cent the speed of light. iF each child were to receive a present no more than 2lbs (0.9kg) in weight, the sleigh would still weigh more than 320,000 tons - just shy of the weight of the Empire State Building, 370,000 tons.

An average reindeer on Earth can pull only 300 pounds (135kg), so in this scenario 214,200 reindeer would be needed. But with the weight and speed of the sleigh, it appears that the front two reindeer - Dasher and Dancer, until Rudolph's inclusion - will be subjected to 13.4 quintillion joules of energy per second.

This will cause them to burst into flames almost immediately after taking flight. The entire reindeer team, assuming only eight are used, would be vapourised in 4.26 thousandths of a second. 

If anyone but Santa wants to fly through the sky, they'll need to stump up a hefty of £200,000 ($313,000).

Mr Ward said: 'We've had a lot of interest but no-one has actually ordered one yet. If anyone does order one, we will build one complete with all the features.'

The Gadget Sleigh's product page comes with fake reviews from Rudolf, Mrs Claus and an elf.

'I love the sleigh. It makes my job easier and the nose-wiper is perfect. I've noticed my nose shining brighter than ever,' wrote Rudolf.

Mrs Claus said: 'The GS-900 is far better than the wooden sleigh and also much safer. He'll get back from his trip much earlier this year which is great as I always give him a little treat on his return.'
