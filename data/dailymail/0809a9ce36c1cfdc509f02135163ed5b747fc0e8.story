Whether it's tornadoes, hurricanes or lightning storms, Nicolaus and Daow Wegner aren't afraid to get dangerously close to them.

The photographer, 34, and his wife, 32, from Casper, Wyoming, US, chase extreme weather conditions to create incredible snaps.

Daow is pictured standing fearlessly with her back to the camera, while the sky looks menacing and threatening - or beautiful - in front of her.  

The couple use forecast tools to predict where storms will show before chasing them down and waiting for them to materialise.

Most of their shots are taken across Wyoming, but sometimes they travel to neighbouring states such as Montana and Nebraska. The pair admit there is an element of danger in their work.

Daow said: 'I'm a little nervous sometimes - but I find the experience exciting and scary at the same time. Life is short so I try to enjoy the moment.'

Nicholaus revealed lightning is the most dangerous element to deal with and has halted their shoots in the past.

He added: 'I try usually to set up well before the storm gets to us.

'Daow does well with the danger but we communicate and if either of us feels unsafe then we pack up and move on.

'My two favourite subjects to photograph are storms and mountains. Mountains are epic in their scale but nothing compares to being next to a dramatic supercell.'
