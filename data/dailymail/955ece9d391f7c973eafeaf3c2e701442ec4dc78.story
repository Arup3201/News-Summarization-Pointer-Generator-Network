Claire O'Hanlon pictured, died after she grabbed onto the back of a truck while drunk and slipped under its wheel after it went over a speed ramp

A ‘bubbly’ woman was crushed to death under the wheels of a scaffolding lorry after drunkenly jumping onto the back to get a lift home, an inquest heard today.

Claire O’Hanlon, 47, suffered massive head and pelvic injuries after the lorry bounced over a sleeping policeman and she fell under the wheels of the five ton truck.

She and housemate Michelle Moore had clambered onto the back of the lorry around 4pm on November 15, 2013, after their friend Kate McMullen got into the cab to join her boyfriend Damon Carr and driver John Boswell.

The women had been waiting at a bus stop near the scene at Danebury Avenue, Roehampton, on their way home following an afternoon out drinking at a nearby club.

Ms O’Hanlon was more than three times over the drink driving limit when they flagged down the lorry after spotting it in the street, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard.

Ms Moore broke down in tears as she told how she pulled Ms O’Hanlon up on to the flatbed lorry after climbing up herself when it was travelling at roughly 3mph.

She looked on in horror as Ms O’Hanlon fell from the vehicle after it moved off and was crushed underneath the rear near-side wheel.

Giving evidence, Ms Moore said: ‘Claire was unpredictable. She could come across as if she wasn’t heavily intoxicated.

‘We were going towards the bus stop when Kate saw Damon go by in the lorry and went over to ask for a lift.

‘He said no, but Kate and his daughter Ella got into the cab and suggested we jump on the back.

‘Claire asked me to give her a lift up by the time the lorry was moving and it all happened very quickly.

‘There was a bus behind us and I tried to give Claire a hand up as the lorry was moving off after I jumped on the back.

‘I looked over and before I knew it, she had gone. The lorry had hit a sleeping policeman, which was where she died.’

In a statement to police, Ms Moore - who had got onboard into a gap between the scaffolding poles - said: ‘Claire’s hands were slipping, I looked behind and saw her lying on the floor.’

Ms Hanlon's friends left a floral tribute near the scene of the tragedy after her death in November 2013 

She described her friend as a ‘happy go-lucky, bubbly’ person.

Paramedics arriving within two minutes of a 999 call found Ms O’Hanlon close to the sleeping policeman surrounded by a crowd.

Nothing could be done to save her and Ms O’Hanlon of Clarence Lane, Roehampton, she was declared dead at the scene.

A post mortem revealed the cause of death as a ‘significant’ head injury following a ‘massive trauma’.

Tests showed she had 293 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of blood, and a 364mg urine alcohol level, which is four times the legal drink drive limit.

Cocaine was also found in her bloodstream plus a small amount of the anti-depressant diazepam.

Driver Mr Boswell, who was driving home from work, told the inquest: ‘I was just driving off with my new passengers in the cab, I didn’t know there were other people (on the back).

‘I knew Damon’s girlfriend was getting in but that was it. As soon as the door was shut I just thought ‘That’s it, we’re ready to go’.

‘Then suddenly we had to stop, the lorry came to a standstill and I knew something had happened.’

Mr Carr told the hearing he heard a ‘scream’ and he jumped off to help but his ‘body turned numb’ and he ‘couldn’t do anything’ to help.

They ruled there was good visibility and the road was dry at the time of the incident, which took place on a ‘cool, dry, evening’.

Cars were parked along the road but traffic levels were good, the inquiry found.

Collision investigator PC Richard Clark, of Thames Police, said: ‘This is not an incident where it requires the benefit of hindsight. It was clearly dangerous.

‘The lorry was excessively overweight but Mr Boswell did not need any extra driving license.

‘Anyone who passes a driving test is told to check their mirrors regularly when moving.

‘A trained HGV lorry driver would be expected to pay extra attention and look constantly for hazards in this built up area, but Mr Boswell was not one.’

Westminster Coroner's Court, pictured, heard that Ms O'Hanlon had an alcohol level in her system of four times the legal drink-drive limit, as well as cocaine and a small amount of the anti-depressant diazepam 

Coroner Shirley Radcliffe recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Ms Radcliffe told the court: ‘This was the tragic death of a young woman who was only 47 years old and fit and well.

‘Sadly she had been drinking on this afternoon, to the extent that her decision making was impaired.

‘Standing at a bus stop with her friends and their friend’s daughter, a lorry drove by which they flagged down and were given a lift on the vehicle.

‘In circumstances not entirely clear, Ms McMullen said the couple should just jump on the back.

‘I am satisfied the driver was unaware of Ms O’Hanlon and Ms Moore and their attempts to get on.

‘Ms Moore was lucky to get a good position on the vehicle, although clearly it was a risky one but Claire could not and sadly tried to get on the side.

‘It was only moving at about 3mph at the time and sadly did not seem as dangerous to her as it does in the cold light of day.

‘The lorry picked up to 15mph and tragically went over a speed cushion, creating some sort of jolt and Claire lost her grip and went underneath the lorry rather than just fall down.

‘Having gone under the rear axle, she was run over by a tyre, giving her a head injury.

‘This was simply a tragic accident and I offer my deepest condolences to her family and friends.’

Mourners left cards, flowers and notes - plus champagne bottles and scones - in memory of Ms O’Hanlon at the scene and paid tribute to a ‘very popular, lovely girl’.
