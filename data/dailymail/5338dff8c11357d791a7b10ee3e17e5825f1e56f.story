Louis van Gaal gave an intriguing insight into his infamous management style during an animated morning at Holland's pre-World Cup training camp.

The 62-year-old Dutchman is set to be named as David Moyes's permanent replacement at Manchester United next week but is busy preparing his Holland squad for the summer showpiece in Brazil.

While many of his country's stars - such as United striker Robin van Persie - are still involved in club action across Europe, Van Gaal is working with players from the Dutch league whose domestic season is already over.

One player who got a hands-on experience of Van Gaal's style was Ajax midfielder Davy Klaassen, who was pictured having his arm grabbed during a particularly animated discussion.

Feyenoord defenders Terence Kongolo and Daryl Janmaat watched on as Klaassen was dragged, literally, in the direction Van Gaal wanted.

While Ryan Giggs may be many fans' choice to take the hot seat at Old Trafford due to his links with United's glorious past, Van Gaal will not shy away from sweeping away any deadwood and imposing his own, distinct style on the squad.

That approach has left a sour taste at several of his previous clubs, including Barcelona and Bayern Munich. In addition, many big names have admitted becoming disillusioned with his attitude, notably Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who branded him a 'dictator with no sense of humour'.

But with spots in his World Cup squad up for grabs, the Dutch youngsters were in no position to argue and listened intently to Van Gaal's instructions.

Daley Blind, the Ajax left back and son of Van Gaal's assistant, Danny Blind, was among the players listening in as their boss barked orders at the training camp in Hoenderloo.

Another one of the Holland assistant coaches Patrick Kluivert, who could also team up with his boss at United was also in attendance, along with Blind Snr.

Van Gaal has revealed he would love to be the next manager of United and will be unveiled once he and the club have agreed the make-up of his coaching staff. 

The former Ajax boss is still talking to other clubs but told BBC Sport: ‘I would love the (United) job. For every coach who takes the job it’s a fantastic challenge.

‘I hope I shall be the one but you’ll have to wait and see. There are more clubs interested. I have more options. It is a process we’re in and everybody has to wait patiently on my choice and that of the clubs.

‘But United are the biggest club in the world’.

United have agreed most of the details with Van Gaal but want to announce his appointment, and the composition of his coaching staff, all at the same time, rather than have a drip-feed of information as was the case when Moyes took the job last year.

United also have to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the Dutch FA. Holland have a World Cup to prepare for under Van Gaal and understandably do not want their preparations disrupted by the publicity surrounding their coach’s future beyond Brazil 2014.
