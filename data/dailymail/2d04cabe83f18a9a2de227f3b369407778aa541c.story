Rosie Fortescue and Millie Mackintosh may be regarded as Chelsea's most stylish exports, but there's a new cast member following in their fashionable footsteps.

Clearly keen to give the stylish duo a run for their money, Made In Chelsea star Lucy Watson has adopted a slick new look - and is preparing to launch a style site to go with it.

The 24-year-old reality TV star has been keeping her fans up-to-date with her trendy new outfit choices via Instagram ahead of the launch of her style blog next year.

Watch out, Millie Mackintosh! Made In Chelsea star Lucy Watson has adopted a slick new look

Lucy, who already runs her own jewellery line and has designed for Lipsy, champions high street brands such as Lipsy, Missguided and Topshop.

There's also a fair few bikini shots thrown in for good measure - so how does Lucy stay so trim during party season? 

Speaking about her festive fitness regime, Lucy, who stars in MIC: FIT, the new Chelsea exercise DVD, said: 'It's important all year to be fit, but obviously if you're going away then you really want to be bikini ready. 

'But if you're staying in London then it's important too because you're going to be invited to parties where you want to wear a little black dress and you want to feel confident. I think it's good to have a balance. 

Balanced approach: Lucy, 24, who has been showing off her toned body on Instagram lately, says she can't stop herself from eating her favourite foods

'I can't, personally, really stop myself from eating what I want to eat. I love food. And I'm a veggie so it's pretty boring for me just to eat vegetables, with no carbohydrates.

'So I just exercise more when I know I need to really look good.'

Currently single, Lucy says her ideal date would be at Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park because the food - in particular the doughnuts - is amazing. 

Although judging by her latest Instagram snaps, she hasn't been indulging on too many sweet treats.

Big plans: Lucy's career has sky-rocketed since joining the hit show and now she's preparing to add another string to her bow with the launch of her style site

Lucy's career has sky-rocketed since joining the hit show. She was recently unveiled as the face - and smooth legs - of Wilkinson Sword, the face of Skinny Tan, as well as Lipsy VIP and has her own book, The Dating Game. 

Currently starring in season 8 of the E4 show that propelled her to fame, Lucy has her sights set on another reality TV show. 

She said: 'I know this is really weird, but I quite like Simon Cowell. Not in a fancying way. I just really want to be good friends with him. I think he'd be really fun. I'd just hang out with him and talk about stuff. 

'Maybe we could judge together. It's my dream job.'

Watch your back, Cheryl! Lucy says she wants to be good friends with Simon Cowell and judging with him on X Factor would be her 'dream job'
