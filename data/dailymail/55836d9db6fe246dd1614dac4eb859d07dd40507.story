Candy corn may be the sweet most commonly associated with Halloween, but it seems the American population is not as enamored with it as one might think.

According to Forbes, a survey conducted by the National Confectioners' Association found that only 12per cent of Americans say the sugary kernels are their favorite Halloween confectionery

The overwhelming majority - 72per cent - said they would much rather trick-or-treat for chocolate, with Reese's the most popular chocolate treat.

Sweet tooth: A new survey conducted by the National Confectioners' Association found that only 12per cent of Americans say candy corn is their favorite Halloween confectionery

The survey found that gummies, chewy and hard candies, lollipops, mints and gum are our least favorite Halloween treats, making up a combined total of just 16per cent.

This is important information to keep in mind next week, since 74per cent of households said they intend to give out candy to visiting trick-or-treaters.

The NCA estimates that the country will spend a whopping $2,392billion overall on Halloween candy this year.

The most popular chocolate brand is Reese's; website 24/7 Wall St found that sales of Reese's candies were around $510million in the past year alone.

M&M's
are Americans' second favorite chocolate, raking in $500.82million in 
sales, and Snickers came in at third, with sales of $456.91 last year.

For parents, the holiday can prove to be a frustrating one when young children get their hands on too many sweets at once.

As such, 41per cent say they limit 
the amount of candy their kids can eat to just a couple of pieces a day 
until their stash runs out.

But while they may keep an eye on 
their little ones' sweet tooth, 41per cent of mothers and fathers 
confess to waiting until their children are in bed or at school to 
pocket candy from their supplies.

1. Chocolate (72%)

2. Candy corn (12%)

3. Chewy and hard candies, lollipops, mints and gum (combined 16%)

When it comes to choosing which candies to offer trick-or-treaters, more than 60per cent of adults said they pick their own personal favorites.

Candy corn may not be America's most preferred Halloween treat, but those who like it certainly are particular about how they eat it.

According to a survey of 1,335 Americans, 42.7per cent prefer nibbling off the narrow white end before eating the rest of the candy.

Nearly half - 46.8per cent - like to eat it all in one bite, and just 10.6per cent start with the wider yellow end first.
