North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-Un has warned that war could break out 'without notice' as he called on his military to be combat ready.

The warning came a day after reports that satellite images appeared to show North Korea has started producing fuel rods for its nuclear reactor.

The U.S. and South Korea had been wary of possible threats from the North, where tensions have been high since the execution of Kim's uncle and mentor.

The latest sabre rattling came as Kim visited his troops on Christmas Eve, according to Al Jazeera.

'He instructed the unit to put utmost 
spurs on rounding off its combat readiness ... always bearing in mind 
that a war breaks out without any prior notice,' reports from state media said.

Tens of thousands of troops pledged their loyalty to Kim last week at a parade to mark the anniversary of the death of his father, and former leader.

Satellite images seen by the Johns Hopkins University appeared to show facilities at the North's scientific research center could be used to make fuel rods for the plutonium reactor.

'The
 identification of these facilities indicates a more wide-ranging, 
extensive effort by North Korea to modernise and restart the Yongbyon 
complex dating back to 2009 than previously understood,' the report 
said.

North Korea's reactor was put back into service earlier this year, after a six-year break, according to the New York Times.

Evidence of renewed activity at the plant comes as the North repeatedly said it was working to improve its nuclear arsenal.

UN inspectors were forced out of North Korea in 2009, a year after the latest round of nuclear arms negotiations failed.

North Korea has also carried out three nuclear tests since 2006, including two since Kim Jong-Un took control of the country after his father's death in 2011.

After the latest calls for troops to be ready, the South has called for its troops to bolster its security measures.

During her trip to a military post on the border, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye described the threats as 'ominous'.

'We should react sternly and mercilessly to any provocations by North Korea,' she said.
