This is the moment a cleaner was caught on camera stealing £140 cash from a 99-year-old woman whose suspicious son had set up a spy camera.

Alan Howarth, 68, planted £200 in cash and rigged up a hidden camera when money started going missing from his mother Elizabeth’s home in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester.

Days later Ivy Peachey, 63, was filmed taking some of the money and stuffing it into her pinafore as she cleaned the house. She has since admitted theft of £140 and been jailed for one month.

Concerns: Alan Howarth (left), 68, planted £200 in cash and rigged up a hidden camera when money started going missing from the home of his mother Elizabeth (right)

However, the family claim an estimated £30,000 of Mrs 
Howarth’s savings remains unaccounted for - an allegation which the Crown Prosecution Service has investigated but found no evidence to support.

After
 the case, Mr Howarth said: ‘I’m just very happy that it she has been found guilty. My mum was absolutely devastated when
 she found out the truth.

‘She
 regarded Ivy as a close personal friend. She’s okay now but it has 
really taken its toll on her. At first she wouldn’t believe it was Ivy 
who had taken the money. It took a lot of convincing.

‘Even
 I couldn’t believe it. My mum finds it hard to trust now and she will 
definitely not be employing anybody else to help with her cleaning. The 
family does it between us now.’

Peachey had been visiting Mrs Howarth’s home for nine years, and cleaned once a fortnight. Mr Howarth then planted £200 for a first time.

Shortly after the cleaner’s visit, Mr Howarth noticed £160 had vanished. He then contacted police who suggested doing the same thing, but planting a camera to catch the culprit in the act.

Mr Howarth said: ‘I decided to plant some money in a little box and monitor it. So after going to the police I did the same thing again and placed a hidden camera there and saw Ivy take money from the box and put it in her pinny.

'I’m just very happy that it has all come out and she has been found guilty. My mum was absolutely devastated when she found out the truth'

‘I even took a note of the serial numbers on the cash and when the police searched her house they found the notes.’

Prosecutors said there was no evidence that Peachey had any access to the pensioner’s bank cards or pin numbers.

Sentencing Peachey yesterday after she
 admitted theft following the incident last year, magistrates told the 
thief that she had shown no remorse throughout the year-long 
investigation.

'Couldn't believe it': Elizabeth Howarth (left) was 'absolutely devastated when she found out the truth' about the thefts by Peachey (right), who has since been jailed for a month and ordered to pay costs of £800

Peachey was jailed for a month last Friday and ordered to pay costs of £800 at Wigan and Leigh Magistrates Court in Lancashire.

'My mum finds it hard to trust now and she will definitely not be employing anybody else to help with her cleaning. The family does it between us now'

Alan Howarth, son

The CPS said: ‘There was no evidence to establish that Ivy Peachey ever had access to the victim’s bank account.

'Therefore there was insufficient evidence to provide a realist prospect of conviction in relation to the allegation of theft of £30,000.’

However, Mr Howarth added: ‘I’m just happy that she has been proven to be a thief and I hope that others who have been victim to her get some satisfaction.’

MailOnline has contacted Peachey's solicitor regarding the case.
