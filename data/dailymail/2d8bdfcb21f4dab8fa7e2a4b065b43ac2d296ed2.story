Allegations: HSBC has made nearly £100m through 'bankrolling' forestry companies who have destroyed vast swathes of the Malaysian rainforest

Global banking giant HSBC has raked in nearly £100m by bankrolling Malaysian logging companies who cause widespread rainforest destruction and abuse human rights, a watchdog has claimed.

The bank is also providing financial services to companies widely suspected of systematic bribery and corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia, according to an investigation by The Global Witness.

The region exports more tropical timber than South America and Africa combined and HSBC's loans and services to logging conglomerates have generated at least £80m in interest and fees.

The watchdog claim that these companies have devastated Malaysian Borneo's rainforests and carried out abuses against indigenous peoples.

These companies are currently logging in an area three times the size of Norway.

'HSBC has bankrolled some of the world's worst logging companies and in some cases got them off the ground with their first commercial loans,' said Tom Picken, Global Witness Forest Campaign leader.

'The destruction they have caused simply couldn't have happened without the services and kudos the bank provided.'

The Global Witness report, entitled 'In the Future There Will Be No Forests Left', also suggests that HSBC is at risk of violating international anti-money laundering regulations because of its links to Malaysia's 'corrupt' forestry sector.

Because Sarawak is headed by Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud, currently under investigation by Malaysia's Federal Anti-Corruption unit, HSBC could fall foul of regulations requiring extra checks on clients linked to senior politicians.

Taib is widely believed to use his complete political control over the region's forestry licensing to benefit his family and associates, says the report.

Global Witness say they have obtained strong evidence showing Taib and members of his family are engaged in systemic corruption and money laundering.

'In light of recent money-laundering scandals, HSBC and its financial regulators urgently need to find out whether the bank is handling illegal transactions from this notoriously corrupt and destructive sector,' added Picken.

The report names four forestry companies linked to HSBC who have violated the bank's 2004 forestry regulations, which state that operations must be certified to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). None of the four had any FSC certification.

They include:

Picken added: 'In 2004 HSBC brought in progressive world-wide forest policies designed to avoid precisely these sorts of commercial relationships and make the bank a market leader on sustainability.

'It has consistently traded on these commitments in public, yet failed to meet them in practice. The bank should hold its hands up, drop these clients immediately and compensate the victims for the mayhem it has helped cause.'

A HSBC spokesman said: 'HSBC cannot discuss current or former clients, whether individuals or corporates, for reasons of confidentiality - in fact to do so would be against the law.'

'HSBC remains committed to sustainable banking, working with interested parties and undertaking responsible engagement with clients to ensure they meet and continue to comply with its sector-specific policies.

'We value the information that NGOs can provide us to help us improve our Sustainability Risk Policies over time and also to help us assess the commitment, capacity and track record of our customers to implement them.

'We look forward to reading your report on forestry in Sarawak and will follow up on credible evidence of social or environmental impact and will take action where necessary.'
