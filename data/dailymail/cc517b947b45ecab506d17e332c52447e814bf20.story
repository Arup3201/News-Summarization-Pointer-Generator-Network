Ryanair's image overhaul will extend to a redesign of their aircraft's interiors that removes 'in your face' yellow and blue colours in favour of something more subtle, the budget carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary says. 

Images of 'happy, smiley people' could also go in place of the Ryanair logos on the walls of their planes as the airline continues an attempt to improve its no frills image, moves for which have already included the reduction in some charges and family incentives.

'If we're going to focus more and more, as we are, on the customer experience, maybe a little less in your face and the use of more subtle colours and better imaging,' said O'Leary in a press conference, admitting he gave the green light to the in-cabin yellow a decade ago.

'I think on the bulkheads we're looking at something a bit more lively than just the yellow with the blue Ryanair logo. 

'We're looking at different alternatives such as photos of happy, smiley people, destinations – something a bit more visually interesting than just the traditional old logo.'

There could be a wait however for any such changes, with O'Leary's publicly announced plans not always coming to fruition - in the past the CEO has mused about standing-room only cabins, coin-operated toilets ('spend a pound to spend a penny') and a 'fat tax' for larger passengers. 

Grain of salt: Not all of the plans O'Leary has spoken of have come to fruition

The earliest travellers are likely to any any widespread change to the Ryanair plane designs would be in 2019 when the airline rolls out a new fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 200s.

O'Leary made his comments while announcing almost 200 of the planes would be delivered as part of a £13.6bn deal with Boeing.
