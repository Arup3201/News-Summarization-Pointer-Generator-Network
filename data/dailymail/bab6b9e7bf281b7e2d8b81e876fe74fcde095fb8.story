Eden Hazard has defended himself against accusations of laziness after some fans and even a Belgian football legend claimed he ‘needs a kick up the a***’.

The Chelsea playmaker is likely to be central to Belgium coach Marc Wilmots’ plans in Brazil but his poor form and apparently indifferent attitude have sparked criticism.

Former Belgium striker Marc Degryse, 48, said the 23-year-old midfielder needed to show more maturity if he is to thrive at the World Cup.

‘Hazard is the type of player who sometimes needs a kick up the a***!’ said Degryse. ‘Against Sweden he switched off several times, just like he did in the Champions League for Chelsea against Atletico Madrid. If that doesn’t change Wilmots will have to resolve it by dropping him.’

Hazard did not appear to be putting in much effort while Belgium were at a training camp in Sweden last week and despite scoring a wonder goal in their 2-0 defeat of Sweden, looked uninterested at times. But, he said, fans should not be deceived by appearances.

‘The way I play I can sometimes seem nonchalant,’ said Hazard. ‘It has always been the same for me. People demand a lot of me and that’s to be expected. But when I play for Chelsea you play one game and even if it doesn’t go well you can immediately play another and redeem yourself.

‘But with the national team, there is more pressure to perform every time. They always expect me to do tricks all the time and score goals and that’s not easy.’

His club manager Jose Mourinho also criticised Hazard after  Chelsea lost 3-1 at home to Spanish side Atletico Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals. Mourinho claimed Hazard neglected his defensive responsibilities.

‘I wouldn’t say the two goals we conceded against Atletico were a result of my lack of effort,’ said Hazard. ‘I don’t agree with that. It was a team error and we have collective responsibility.’

Belgium have been picked by many as dark horses for the World Cup. Hazard said the near 4,000 crowd who have attended every training session at their camp in Westkapelle on the Belgian coast is indicative of the high expectations people have of the team.

Interest in England is heightened by the inclusion of 12 Premier League players in the squad. Only England, with 22, have more.

Hazard is joined by Chelsea team-mates Thibaut Courtois and Romelu Lukaku, who both spent last season out on loan. Tottenham provide a trio, Nacer Chadli, Mousa Dembele and Jan Vertonghen, there are Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj from Manchester United, Manchester City’s Vincent Kompany, Arsenal’s Thomas Vermaelen, Everton’s Kevin Mirallas and Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet.

‘People expect a lot of us and obviously we would like to go very far although we are very young and inexperienced in World Cups and major tournaments,’ said Hazard.

‘But having so many players who play every week in the Premier League shows the talent and quality we have.’
