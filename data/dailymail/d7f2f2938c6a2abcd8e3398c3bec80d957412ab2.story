Leeds United proved their Championship top-half credentials with a hard-fought 1-0 win over struggling Millwall.

Alex Mowatt's deflected free-kick gave Neil Redfearn's side their fourth win in five games, a run of form that had seen Leeds move into the top half.

Redfearn issued his players a challenge to finish in the top-half this week, and despite a scrappy performance, Mowatt's free-kick moved the Whites ahead of Bolton Wanderers following their 4-3 defeat to Watford.

Martyn Woolford - a Leeds target during last month's transfer window - missed Millwall's best chance in the second half and the home side clung on for a valuable three points.

The 29-year-old winger also saw a volleyed effort fly over as the clock ticked down for Millwall to find an equaliser.

Leeds dominated the opening period, with Sol Bamba and Rodolph Austin both missing chances - but they had to wait until six minutes before the half-time break to open the scoring.Â

Shaun Williams brought down Sam Byram on the edge of the box, and Mowatt's free-kick crept inside David Forde's near post via a deflection.

Both sides missed chances in the second-half, with Ricardo Fuller hitting the side netting for Millwall, but Leeds held out for all three points to move them into Redfearn's desired top-half spot.
