Passengers arriving in the U.S. were removed from a plane because of a threatening note suggesting explosives were on board.

The US Airways flight that arrived on Friday in Philadelphia from Scotland was taken to a different part of the airport to be inspected.

But a thorough search of Flight 968 by officials and explosives experts found no problems and the plane continued onto Anchorage, Alaska.

The note in question was sent to a London address and mentioned an explosive threat on the plane, FBI officials told NBC Philadelphia.

The Boeing 757 with 157 passengers and six crew members had landed in the Pennsylvania city on Friday afternoon from Glasgow.

But Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials asked everyone on board to get off so it could be swept by law enforcement officials.

The passengers were taken inside one of the airport's seven terminals, and baggage handlers unloaded the Boeing 757 across the tarmac.

An explosive ordnance removal technician x-rayed at least one suitcase outside, and a policeman later dumped its contents onto the ground.

Other items aboard the plane from Glasgow to Anchorage, which also was carrying commercial cargo, were examined too.

Passengers inside the terminal who were continuing on to Alaska were interviewed by investigators but no delays were caused by the evacuation.

Philadelphia International Airport handled 31 million passengers last year and it is the only major airport serving the Philadelphia area.

Airlines that use Terminal A, where the passengers were taken, include Lufthansa, British Airways, US Airways, Air Jamaica and Frontier.

In June, flights were grounded at Reagan National Airport near Washington D.C. after a woman said there was a bomb on board a plane.

The woman, who had a history of mental health problems, claimed the warning came to her in a message from God.

No explosives were found aboard the jet that flew from Dayton in Ohio to Reagan Airport and the woman was taken to a mental health facility.
