An American Eagle aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing and evacuate passengers following a report of fumes in the cockpit.

Flight 3235, carrying 63 passengers, made the unscheduled landing at Tulsa International Airport 45 minutes after taking off from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

Tulsa Airport Authority spokeswoman Alexis Higgins said the plane, which was traveling to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was evacuated on the runway at about 6.15pm last night, local time.

Ms Higgins added that the plane was able to safely taxi down the runway after landing.

One passenger on board spoke of how he tried to remain calm as the plane made the enforced landing.

Speaking to ABC News Gibril Mansaray said: 'I tried to logic the fear out of myself,' 

'I tried to say like, you know the odds of me dying in a plane crash, are very minute, so let me just try to keep myself together and then I was still thinking, I don't want to die in a plane crash.'

Ms Higgins said none of the 67 passengers or crew members was injured. She did not know what caused the fumes in the cockpit, and referred questions to the airline.

American Airlines spokeswoman Victoria Lupica says the airline is still trying to determine the cause of the fumes.

Once the aircraft was on the ground, fire crews investigated the source of the fumes and mechanics are also examining the plane.

Fire engines were called into action once the plane grounded and passengers had vacated the aircraft and taken to the terminal.

Speaking to Fox23, passenger John Clark said: 'It was exciting enough, but not crazy,' 

'Enough to make your heart beat a little fast, but people weren't like taking crash procedures or anything. Just a little white knuckled.'

The American Eagle jet, operated by American Airlines, offers flights to cities throughout the United States, Canada, the Bahamas, the Caribbean and Mexico.
