Barack Obama has failed black Americans as unemployment soars to depression-era levels, a Republican presidential hopeful has claimed.

Michele Bachmann said that unemployment among the black community has rocketed to 16 per cent during Obama's term.

Shockingly, the African-American unemployment levels are the same as the depression era in 129 and up from 12.7 per cent when Obama was inaugurated in January 2009.

Figures: Republic presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said Barack Obama had failed blacks after African-American unemployment reached 16 per cent

Ms Bachmann singled out the figures during a scathing attack on the first black U.S. president at a talk in New Orleans over the weekend.

'Mr. President, the status quo is not working for Americans,' she said at the Republican Leadership Conference.

'This president has failed the Hispanic community. He has failed the African-American community. He has failed us all when it comes to jobs.'

Ms Bachmann, who hopes to be the Republican presidential candidate, spoke at the event alongside the other current contenders Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul and Herman Cain. Her figures were backed up by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Recent figures show that overall African American joblessness stands at 16.2 percent. For black males, unemployment is 17.5 per cent while black teenagers have a  41 per cent unemployment rate - up from 36.3 percent when Obama was elected.

Overall unemployment in the Hispanic community was 9.9 per cent when Obama was inaugurated but by May 2011 it had risen to 11.9 percent. Among Hispanic 16 to 19-year-olds the unemployment rate was 24.3 percent in January 2009 and had risen to 26.1 percent by May 2011.

Ms Bachmann targeted the area which is considered by many to be Obama's weakest area.

Poor: Recent figures show that overall African American joblessness stands at 16.2 percent - up from 12.7 per cent in January 2009.

Commentators suggest that his hopes of winning the 2012 election rest on how he can perform on key financial issues and reassure struggling Americans.

'The status quo certainly isn't working for the African-American community, with 16 percent unemployment, or the Hispanic community, with nearly 12 percent unemployment,' Ms Bachmann added, according to CNS.

'It's even worse for the youth: For Hispanic youth right now, 26 percent unemployment; for African-American youth, 40 percent unemployment.

'This president has failed the Hispanic community. He has failed the African-American community. He has failed us all when it comes to jobs.'

The worrying figures emerged as leaders of a national Hispanic organization slammed  Obama for skipping their annual conference for the third consecutive year.

He had previously promised in 2008 when he was running for election that he would return as president to speak. But the no-show has angered the group.

Members of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials have also criticised Obama's earlier pledges on immigration reform after deportations actually increased during his term.

The president is attempting to woo many Hispanic voters. The community has traditionally had low turn outs at elections but their influence could swing the final vote, commentators suggest.

'It is getting harder and harder for the president to go into a venue where he is confronted by Latinos because he is in a jam,' NALEO member Luis Gutierrez told Politico.

'In front of a group like NALEO, blaming Republicans for their intransigence on immigration reform and not addressing what the president’s own administration is doing to immigrants would not wash. So it isn’t surprising to me that the president is not showing up.'
