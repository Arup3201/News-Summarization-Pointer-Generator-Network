A dilapidated old mill that starred in Bryan Adams’ huge hit (Everything I do) I Do It For You, has just been put on the market for £60,000.

There's thick vegetation growing on the roof and debris and decay is all around, but Silk Mills on the outskirts of Holford in Somerset’s Quantock Hills is a historic building with links not just to the Canadian crooner but also to the Huguenots and textile production.

The building, a few miles from Kilve beach, near Bridgwater, and its leafy grounds appeared in the video that topped the British charts in 1991 for a record-breaking 16 weeks.

For sale: It's seen better days but this mouldy mill has a rich history, including a starring role the Bryan Adams video (Everything I Do) I Do It For You

Atmospheric: The mill and its shadowy grounds gave a soothing touch to Bryan Adams' video. The Canadian crooner owns a £2.4 million London home, but will he put an offer in?

It was also the theme for the Hollywood blockbuster Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, starring Kevin Costner.

It is being sold by the League Against Cruel Sports, which will retain sporting rights over the land. The deadline for bids is 7 December.

Joe Duckworth, Chief Executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: 'The League is selling this particular property to help us to achieve our immediate charitable objectives, which at present this does not contribute to. Any money raised will be reinvested to aid the achievement of our charities aims.'

The ramshackle remains at the heart of the 1.3 acre site date from the 18th century when French Protestants began making textiles there.

The property is 11.2 metres long and 3.7 metres wide with a potential for extension say the local estate agents Seddons. Depending on the final planning permission that is granted, the site could be used for residential or business purposes or a mix of both.

Damp and dilapidated: Claire Bellew of Estate Agents Seddon in Tiverton, Devon, is marketing the mill. A nearby stream has the potential for hydro power

Potential for a good view: Depending on local authority restrictions, estate agents say it could be used for housing, business or both

Down but not out: The building and surrounding grounds have potential for residential and business oportunites say local estate agents

The building is part of a mill complex
says Richard Stagg from Seddons in Tiverton, Devon, who 
says he has been inundated with inquiries.

There are the footings of larger buildings on the site and it is believed that the area was involved with textile production, including the usage of silk.

'It's
been a long time since it was used and bringing it back to life is 
important... it's very important how we treat our heritage,' said Mr 
Stagg.

There is a stream running through the grounds and a feasibility study carried out in 2009 concluded that the site would be suitable for hydro power, according to Seddons.

The Rock ballad (Everything I do) I 
Do It For You, is Bryan Adams' most successful song -- it has sold 
millions of copies worldwide and it has also been covered by numerous 
artists. It dominated the charts in the UK and the US for several weeks,
breaking lots of records.

Adams owns a house in London worth 
£2.4 million and announced last month that he was expecting his second 
child with his assistant Alicia Grimaldi.

He is still performing - his latest 
tour is called The Bare Bones Tour - and earlier this month he published
a book of his of photographic work called Exposed.
