A soldier beat up an RAF comrade after discovering he was having an affair with his wife, a court martial heard.

Lisa Jacques, 28, and Corporal Justin Ashton, 37, started the relationship after swapping illicit texts and photos showing each other naked in the bath.

In order for the pair to carry out the affair in the privacy of his quarters, IT expert Cpl Ashton paid for the mother-of-two to hire a babysitter.

But it all came to an end after 
Corporal Dale Jacques was tipped off about the relationship and 
allegedly attacked his love rival, leaving him bloodied and bruised.

Furious at being beaten up, Cpl Ashton
then demanded Mrs Jacques pay him £50,000 in return for not reporting 
the alleged brawl to the RAF police.

Last night Cpl Jacques, serving with 
the Royal Signals, was cleared of actual bodily harm by a court martial 
in Catterick, North Yorkshire.

Now Cpl Ashton is facing a perjury 
investigation amid allegations that he lied by telling the hearing that 
he did not sleep with the married woman. The incident happened in March 
last year while the two men served at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire, the 
headquarters of the Armed Forces Joint Service Signals Organisation.

The court martial heard that Cpl 
Jacques confronted the airman in a laundry at the base’s gym after he 
was told about the affair by a friend.

The physical training instructor and 
ex-boxer headbutted and punched Cpl Ashton up to 50 times after 
discovering he had swapped intimate text messages with his wife, it was 
claimed.

But Cpl Jacques said he threw only one punch when provoked by Cpl Ashton who was wielding a traffic cone.

Cpl Ashton, who had high security 
clearance, claimed he was just friends with Mrs Jacques but admitted 
they had sent mobile phone pictures of each other in the bath.

But Mrs Jacques told the hearing they did have sex and that he tried to force her to delete the offending messages.

She told the court martial that Cpl 
Ashton demanded £50,000 to stop him reporting the alleged assault, then 
cut his demand to £2,500. When she insisted she only had £300 he 
replied: ‘That’s not enough.’

After he failed to get any money, Cpl 
Ashton reported the incident to the military police. He admitted asking 
the woman for £50,000, but denied blackmailing her.

The court martial heard that because 
of Cpl Ashton’s high-level security vetting ‘engaging in an illicit 
affair with another soldier’s wife would be about as bad as it gets’.

The panel cleared Cpl Jacques of 
causing actual bodily harm and accepted his argument that he had used 
‘minimum’ force against Cpl Ashton. Cpl Jacques and his wife are now 
getting divorced.
