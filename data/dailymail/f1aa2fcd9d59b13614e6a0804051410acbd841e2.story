Tragedy: Rebecca McManus, 21, was killed when a car crashed into a bus shelter in Birmingham on Saturday

A recent graduate has been killed after a car ploughed into her as she waited for a bus with a friend on a night out to celebrate finishing her degree.

Rebecca McManus, 21, died after she was hit at by a Mitsubishi at a bus stop close to Birmingham city centre at 7.50pm on Saturday.

Miss McManus was pronounced dead at the scene while her friend, also 21, was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where she remains in a critical condition.

Miss McManus had recently moved back to Oldbury after completing her three-year English Literature with Creative Writing degree at the University of East Anglia in Norwich last month.

Her family today paid tribute to her saying: 'Rebecca lived life to the full; she was bright and funny with a wonderful future to look forward to. We are totally devastated by her loss.'

A 32-year-old man from Birmingham has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Sgt Paul Hughes, from West Midlands Police, said: 'This is a tragic incident which has left a young member of the local community dead and another critically ill in hospital.

'I have been overwhelmed by the number of witnesses that have come forward so far but continue to appeal for the public's help.

'I know the vehicle involved, a red Mitsubishi, travelled along the A4123 WolverhamptonÂ  Road before turning onto Hagley Road West, and may have been travelling with another dark-coloured vehicle, possibly a BMW.

'If anyone saw these vehicles then I would ask them to contact me or my team.

'It's important for the investigation and the families that we piece together all the events and I can only do this with the public's help.'

Tributes have been left at the scene of the crash. One said: 'Becky, one of the nicest people I've ever met. Rest in peace, love Luke and George.'

Tributes: Flowers and cards have been left at the bus stop, which was destroyed when a Mitsubishi ploughed into Miss McManus and her friend, who is in a critical condition

Lynsey Grant, who stopped to help Rebecca shortly after the crash, left a card to her family, saying: 'We are so sorry for your pain.

'Please know that these young ladies were cared for with urgency and compassion by all at the scene. My heart and thoughts are with you.'

Witness Furquan Shamshi has described how the car ploughed into the two women.

He said: '[The driver] lost control, smashed into the bus stop and went into the girls waiting there.

'The noise was so loud and was just awful. The car ended up in the park about 100 yards down from the bus stop.

'The park was busy with people enjoying the weather, so I'm amazed more people weren't hurt.

'I ran over to help and saw two women lying on the ground.

'It was clear she had already gone.

'It looked like the girls were heading into town to enjoy a night out and that that happens. It's so tragic.'
