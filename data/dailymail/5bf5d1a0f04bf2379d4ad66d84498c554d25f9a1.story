A new band designed to prevent shark attacks on surfers and swimmers is surfacing this weekend, with endorsements from survivors of such traumatic experiences endorsing the new technology.

Created by American Nathan Garrison in partnership with his father David, Sharkbanz is already available stateside, while the Australian launch will take place in Melbourne this weekend.

Using electromagnetic currents to deter sharks from an area, the band – which is about the size of a watch – has been tested on nearly a dozen species of sharks so far and aims to ensure that humans and sharks can enjoy the ocean together without danger.

A new device called Sharkbanz is launching in Australia this weekend, aiming to make the ocean a safer place

Shark attack survivor Paddy Trumbull, 65, who had her buttocks torn off by a bull shark in Queensland in February 2010 said such a device would have 'absolutely' prevented her attack.

Mrs Trumbull was swimming out to a boat which had taken she and three other couples snorkelling off Dent Island in the Whitsundays when she felt an 'almighty grab'.

'It was part of the way back to the boat I felt this almighty grab … and I knew immediately without even looking back that it was a shark,' Mrs Trumbull told Daily Mail Australia.

'I turned around and faced this shark and he had the top of his teeth on my back and the bottom of his teeth on my thighs.

After being shaken 'like a ragdoll' a dragged underwater Mrs Trumbull, still fighting the creature by punching and poking it was finally released.

'The shark let me go and I remember feeling the shark rip my flesh and the stinger suit from my body.'

Despite this horrific experience the 65-year-old said she wishes no harm on the marine creatures, instead saying the Sharkbanz will allow her to once again harmoniously share the ocean with sharks. 

'I'm very anti-culling and I have a fascination with sharks', she said before adding that doesn't mean she isn't apprehensive to enter the ocean after her experience.

Mrs Trumbull said there was 'no question' the Sharkbanz would mean she would spend much more time in the water.

'It would really really help me.'

The device's co-founder Nathan said the inspiration for the Sharkbanz came from a life spent on the water and a number of traumatic experiences of his own. 

'I grew up on the ocean my whole life on the east coast of the USA … I had my first real experience with sharks when I was 15 when my best friend got bitten by one which tore up his foot,' Nathan told Daily Mail Australia.

He said as an avid surfer and diver he'd had many close calls since his teenage years which prompted him to think about what could make the experience safer for everyone.

'A lot of surfers can attest to being out there in the ocean and feeling an eerie feeling and just being watched by something, especially in murky water,' said Nathan.

'It's just really hair-raising and I just wanted to have something that could help protect people', he said before adding that the Sharkbanz in no way harms sharks.

Akin to shining a light in the shark's eyes, the device sends out a signal to let the creatures know that humans aren't food

Aimed at warding off common 'hit and run' attacked by many shark species, the technology has been tested on the most predatory species including bull sharks, blacktips, lemon sharks and tiger sharks.

Akin to shining a light in the shark's eyes, the device sends out a signal to let the creatures know that humans aren't food. Similar products currently on the market sell for upwards of $300, while the Sharkbanz is only $84. 

'I wanted to make something that combined affordability, simplicity and stylishness,' Nathan said.

'I'd love to see people adopt the product and see a reduction in those kind of attacks.'

'A lot of it is about getting people back in the water who are scared in light of recent attacks,' he added.

'I want people to enjoy how glorious and wonderful the ocean is.'
