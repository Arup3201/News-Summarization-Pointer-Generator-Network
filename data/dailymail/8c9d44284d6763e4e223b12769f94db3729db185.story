Fortified with barbed wire, and defended by machine guns and mortar, it was once a symbol of the bloody Battle of the Somme - fiercely fought over by British and German forces.

Now, the Butte de Warlencourt - one of the most iconic features of the Great War - stands overlooking the landscape of Northern France, almost unrecognisable.

Overgrown and unkempt, the mound, once a position of great strength for German forces, affording them clear views across the surrounding countryside and their opposition, was destined to be bulldozed to make way for housing by French developers.

But thanks to a band of World War One enthusiasts, the Butte will be restored to its former glory in time for the centenary of the Great War, next year.

The Western Front Association bought the site 23 years ago from a local farmer for £7,500 in a bid to preserve it for future generations, the Express reports. 

The group has now chosen to transform it into a 'must visit' location.

They plan to restore the pathway to the summit, install new walkways and handrails, and also place memorial benches around the site. 

They will mount information boards on the mound explaining its historical significance.

The project will start in the autumn and the group aim to be finished in time for next year’s commemorations.

During the Battle of the Somme the Butte became an obsession.

In German possession throughout 1916 it only came into Allied possession in 1917, after the German retirement to the Hindenburg line in February, despite an earlier attempt by British forces to gain control of it. 

At 250ft the Butte had given German commanders clear views across the battlefields and on enemy lines.

The Butte de Warlencourt became significant to many as the final hurdle before the strategically-important town of Bapaume

According to Lt Colonel Roland Boys Bradford -  who was awarded a Victoria Cross for his role in an attempt to scale the mound and seize it from the Germans -  it 'loomed large in the minds of soldiers' in a battle which has since come to symbolise the horrors of warfare in World War One

In an account, he said: 'The Butte de Warlencourt had become an obsession.

'Everybody wanted it. It loomed large in the minds of the soldiers in the forward area and they attributed many of their misfortunes to it. The newspaper correspondents talked about "that miniature Gibraltar".'

The Battle of the Somme started in July 1st 1916 and lasted until November that year.

The date of July 1, 1916, is remembered as the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army. The Battle of the Somme began at 7.30am that day, and by the following morning 19,240 British soldiers had died

The bloody fighting led to 420,000 British Army casualties including nearly 60,000 on the first day alone. The French lost 200,000 men and the Germans nearly 500,000.

But the Butte de Warlencourt became significant to many as the final hurdle before the strategically-important town of Bapaume.

WFA's Bob Paterson told the paper the Butte was the 'jewel in our crown'.

He said: 'Having saved it from destruction this piece of France will continue to be preserved as a fitting memorial to those of all nations who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the fields that surround it.

The WFA is appealing for sponsorship and donations towards the Butte de Warlencourt restoration project.
