Distraught: Singer Ian 'H' Watkins, pictured, has been confused for the convicted paedophile with the same name for a second time

Pop star Ian 'H' Watkins tweeted his anger after he was mistaken for his Lostprophets namesake for a second time.

Last month, a picture of the former Steps singer was mistakenly used on celebrity website E! Online instead of the disgraced paedophile rock singer.

Former Lostprophets frontman Ian Watkins 
was jailed for 35 years at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday for a string 
of child sex offences. 

'H' received a High Court apology from US parent company E! Entertainment Television in London yesterday.

But last night the singer tweeted his 
anger after another article appeared online alongside his photograph.

The second incident was nothing to do with E! 
Online.

'H' posted a screen-grab from Google showing a CBS News story about the sentencing of the former Lostprophets singer alongside his photo, with a caption from BBC News.

Watkins said on Twitter: 'I can't actually tell you how angry and upset I am right now.

'SORT THIS OUT @CBSNews @google !!!! I am very upset ... Again !!!'

He later posted, 'So, it seems @CBSNews are not to blame..... My lawyers are now dealing with @google'

Yesterday H's agent told The Mirror: 'Ian is astonished that in spite of yesterday's public apology from E! Online, Google have now created far more damaging and far-reaching false and defamatory coverage linking our client to the appalling crimes of the Lostprophets singer.

'His solicitors are taking immediate and determined steps to urgently rectify the position.'

A Google spokesman said yesterday they were looking into the issue and today said it had been resolved.

A court yesterday heard Watkins had already been 'receiving abuse as a result of people confusing the two Ian Watkins' before the initial error over the photograph was made on November 27.

Distress: The singer took to Twitter to vent his anger at the  mistake last night

Mistake: The singer's photo appeared next to a CBS News article, pictured. The Steps star tweeted this image of the mistake

Convicted: Lost Prophets singer Ian Watkins was sentenced to 35 years in prison this week for a string of sex offences

His solicitor John Reid told the judge
 that the defendant, E! Entertainment Television, 'reported the guilty 
plea of Ian Watkins of the Lostprophets in an article on E! Online.'

He
 added: 'However, the defendant mistakenly included a photograph of the 
claimant, Ian 'H' Watkins of Steps, instead of Ian Watkins of the 
Lostprophets.'

He said: 'The error quickly came to the attention of the defendant, which promptly replaced the photograph with the correct one.'

Mr Reid told the judge that the defendant also promptly added an editor's note to the article, stating: 'This story was originally published with an image of Ian 'H Watkins of the band Steps rather than Ian Watkins of the Lostprophets. E! Online deeply regrets this error.'

E! Entertainment Television also promptly emailed and telephoned his management to apologise.

Solicitor Timothy Pinto told the judge that, on behalf of the defendant, he confirmed everything said by Mr Reid 'and apologises for the distress and damage caused by the publication of the photograph'.

Last night, celebrity friends of 'H' showed support for the singer.

Singer Michelle Heaton said: 'It's disgusting how anyone can make a huge mistake like that.'
