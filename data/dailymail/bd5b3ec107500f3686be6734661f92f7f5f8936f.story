A California man claims Los Angeles police officers attacked him while he was riding his bicycle to work on Friday night, leaving him with a dislocated shoulder, a fractured elbow and a bloodied face.

Brian Cisneros, 34, told KCAL that he was traveling to his job in Marina del Ray around 11 p.m. when he was approached by a police car. 

'The doors flew open, and the lights were on me,' he said. 'They drew their guns down and they just attacked me. And they threw me on the floor, and they started stomping my face in.'

LAPD officials say they are investigating the incident.

Cisneros' sister, Cassandra Gonzalez, said the officers kept shouting for Cisneros to stop resisting, but she claims he wasn't putting up a fight.

'They choked me out and all that, and then they threw me on their hood,' Cisneros told KCAL. '[I thought] I’m gonna die, I’m never going to see my kids again.'

After he was allegedly brutalized, the officers issued him a citation for operating his bicycle without lights after dark. 

Cisneros went to the hospital the morning after the attack, where he was treated for his injuries. He later filed a complaint against the police.

Cisneros has a criminal record but says his record has been clean for the last 10 years.

'I’m a working man, a family man, I’m just trying to take care of my business,' he said.

In a message posted to Facebook, his sister said: 'Brian is not on parole or probation. Nor does he have any warrants out for his arrest. We are looking into whether or not there is a documented call dispatched making him a person of interest or a suspect to establish reasoning for the initial stop.'

She added that Cisneros is currently 
staying with a relative 'in fear of retaliation for going public and 
speaking out against the abuse of these LAPD officers.'

Police say Cisneros has given them conflicting statements about the incident and that his accusations are under investigation. 

LAPD officials told KCAL that the officers involved in the incident logged it as a traffic stop.
