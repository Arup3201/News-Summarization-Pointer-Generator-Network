Miralem Pjanic's superstrike may have come as a surprise to the watching world, but the Roma playmaker had been readying himself for such an opportunity this week.

Footage has emerged of the 24-year-old trying out a similar technique while practicing American Football field goals during training with the Denver Broncos.

And perhaps United 'keeper Ben Amos would have been wise to check out the vine of his long-range effort before the Guinness International Champions Cup friendly to avoid being embarrassed by the Bosnian midfielder.

Just for kicks: Miralem Pjanic practices the technique that brought about his wondergoal against United

Pjanic and his Roma team mates have been put through their paces at the Broncos' training base during their US tour - and some downtime allowed him to have a kick at goal with an American football.

His kick was hard and true - much like his goal against United, and it seemed to prove that practice makes perfect.

Roma boss Rudi Garcia later said: 'Pjanic's goal? Amazing.

'They'll watch it the world over. His practice with the Broncos yesterday paid off...'
