Manchester City full-back Aleksandar Kolarov has admitted he would like to return to Italy.

Inter Milan are among the clubs tracking the Serbia defender who spent three years in Serie A with Lazio before joining the Barclays Premier League champions for £16million.

It was Roberto Mancini who signed Kolarov at City in 2010 and the Inter manager is understood to be interested in being reunited with his former player this summer.

Kolarov's wages could be an issue for Inter after he signed a new three-year deal with the club in June 2014, but the 29-year-old could be looking for the Etihad exit at the end of this season.

'I'd like to return to Italy, but it's difficult,' Kolarov said following Serbia's 2-1 defeat by Portugal on Sunday night. 'I'm happy for [Sampdoria manager Sinisa] Mihajlovic.

'He's doing very well, as are Lazio. They're having a great season and I hope they can end it in third or even second place.'

Kolarov has made 101 appearances in the Premier League for City, winning the title twice.
