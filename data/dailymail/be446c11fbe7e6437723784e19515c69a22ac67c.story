A plan to keep David Cameron as Tory leader even if he loses the election to Ed Miliband, is being drawn up by senior allies.

Cabinet colleagues, including George Osborne and Michael Gove, will attempt to form a protective ring around Mr Cameron if he falls short in May – provided Mr Miliband does not secure a decisive victory.

They believe that continuity at the top will be essential if there is a prospect of a second general election.

Senior Tories have hatched a plan to keep David Cameron as Tory leader even if he loses the election to Ed Miliband

Tory high command is even preparing to declare a ‘moral victory’ if – as some polls suggest - Mr Cameron secures more votes than Labour but emerges with fewer seats.

Mr Cameron will come under intense pressure to step down if he loses to Mr Miliband, who many Tories rate as the worst Labour leader since Michael Foot.

The last leader of a major party to cling on after defeat was Neil Kinnock in 1987.

One Tory MP said Mr Cameron ‘won’t last five minutes’ unless he manages to retain the keys to Downing Street in May. ‘He either wins, or he goes,’ the MP said. ‘He has said himself that if he can’t beat Miliband he doesn’t deserve to be in this game, and he’s right.’

But some senior ministers believe Mr Cameron should stay on if Mr Miliband is only able to cobble together a fragile coalition.

In this scenario, they fear the party could be plunged into a destabilising leadership battle in the run-up to a second election that could take place as early as the autumn.

Mr Osborne is reported to have held talks with Tory whips last week to draw up a ‘Save Dave’ strategy for protecting Mr Cameron from an internal challenge, although a source close to the Chancellor insisted the Conservatives were still ‘playing to win’.

Current polls suggest that neither Labour nor the Conservatives will secure an outright majority in May – raising the prospect of either another coalition or a period of minority government.

Senior Tories are urging Mr Cameron to govern alone if the Conservatives emerge as the largest party but do not have an overall majority. They argue that ditching the Lib Dems would allow the party to govern properly, and free up 23 ministerial jobs to aid party management.

One Cameron ally said: ‘If there is an opportunity to govern without going into coalition, we would seize it.’
