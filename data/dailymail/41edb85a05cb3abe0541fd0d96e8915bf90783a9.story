Mayor Alan Long, of Murrietta, California, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influece

The mayor of a California city was driving under the influence when he rear-ended a car and injured four cheerleaders, police said.

Murrieta Mayor Alan Long, who was arrested on suspicion of DUI, was released Friday on $50,000 bail.

Long, who is also a battalion chief with the Anaheim Fire Department, failed a field sobriety test Thursday, but passed a breathalyzer test. 

Police are awaiting blood test results, according to police Lt. Julie Hoxmeier.

Long, 44, plowed into the back of the car carrying Murrieta Valley High School cheerleaders from a pep rally while it was stopped at a light, police said.

The girls, ranging in age from 14 to 17, were taken to the hospital with moderate to major injuries.

Andrea Williams and sisters Camille and Chloe Rogers were treated and released, KGTV reported.

A fourth cheerleader, Melissa Reynolds, remains in the hospital. 

Mayor Long's attorney says he was going at 25mph when he rear-ended a car and injured four cheerleaders

Long will remain on duty with the Anaheim Fire Department as the investigation proceeds, said Lt. Bob Dunn, an Anaheim police spokesman.

The mayor made national news in July when he encouraged residents to oppose a federal government plan to process Central American immigrants at the U.S. Border Patrol facility in Murrieta.

Buses transporting the immigrants to the facility were forced to turn around when protesters blocked the road. 

Long's attorney , Virginia Blumental, says the mayor 'extends his sincere apologies,' the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported. 

'Mr. Long has never been arrested before and has never been at fault in an accident,' Blumenthal said in a statement to the paper.

'It is my firm belief that while there has been an accident, there was no crime committed.'

Long is running for a second-term in the November 4 election.

The attorney, who says Long was traveling at 25mph at the time of the crash, said the mayor helped the victims at the scene and spoke to their parents after, according to the Press-Enterprise. 

'No special favors were extended to the Murrieta Mayor by the city’s police department, and the mayor did not request any special favors in the handling of his case,' Blumenthal said in a statement. 

'The police did their jobs as Mr. Long would expect them to do.' 

Long did not immediately return an email seeking comment. Calls to his office rang unanswered.
