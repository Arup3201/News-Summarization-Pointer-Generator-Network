A magistrate was today cleared of benefit fraud after claiming £22,500 in incapacity allowance while working as a salsa teacher.

Wayne Middleton, 48, took up salsa dancing as a hobby seven years ago and continued to teach despite being 'unable to walk without being in severe pain'.

He was also filmed abseiling down a 150ft tower, stilt walking and grass skiing when he appeared on Channel 4’s Coach Trip.

Mr Middleton trained as a salsa teacher in 2008 and taught at least two 45-minute classes each week.

But the former zoo volunteer was found not guilty of fraudulently signing paperwork declaring he was incapable of working.

District Judge Lorraine Morgan said she believed his role as a dance instructor was 'passive not active' and that his TV appearance took 'exceptional effort'.

She added that his work at a salsa club mainly involved aspects of organisation and administration.

The judge also said she could 'not attach any importance' to the fact that he was fit enough to work as a magistrate while claiming to be unfit to do paid work.

Sitting at North Somerset Magistrates Court in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, District Judge Morgan said: 'At first glance, the activities seem to be at variation with the money awarded to him and on the face of it wholly inconsistent.

'But I accept his participation in 
those activities needed careful planning and preparation and came at a 
price of increased pain and greater restriction on his mobility in the 
days that followed.'

Mr Middleton, from Stanton Drew, near Bristol, first received benefits in 1999 after he twice appealed a decision to reject him.

He re-filed his application in 2003 and was listed as receiving the benefits indefinitely unless he informed officials that his circumstances had changed.

Mr Middleton claimed he was entitled to the cash because he suffered with fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over his body.

He was accused of fraudulently claiming at least £22,500 in disability living allowance and incapacity benefits from 2005 onwards.

Prosecutors claimed he failed to declare a change in his circumstances which left him fit enough to work.

During the trial, Mr Middleton 
insisted he did not want to 'sit around and do nothing' and that his 
doctor recommended he take up salsa dancing.

He told the court: 'I have nothing to hide whatsoever. My condition is very real.

Wayne Middleton appeared on a salsa class flyer 
(circled in red). In relation to his salsa dancing, 
District Judge Morgan said: 'I have found the defendant's role at Salsa 
Bristol is more of an involvement in the organisation and administration
of the club than that of a leading dancer or instructor'

'I knew I would never be able to be a dancer so I decided to learn to teach. It gave me a lot of friends, it makes you feel like you are alive and have something to do.

'I have to do something with my life - you just can’t sit and do nothing.

'You don’t know what it is like to live in pain your whole life, my pain is never going to go away. It doesn’t matter what I do - you either do these things or you don’t.

'You have to live with it.'

In 2008, he helped set up Salsa Bristol, a dance company to teach others after training as an instructor.

The court heard that Mr Middleton also undertook a volunteer role at Bristol Zoo to help feed birds one day a week in 2005 but it soon became apparent it was 'beyond his physical capabilities'.

But despite the role, Mr Middleton said his condition left him in so much pain that he could not stand to cook a meal.

He
said: 'I don’t eat in the mornings, I don’t want to get out of bed. 
Many times my first meal is at around five or six when friends come to 
visit me.

'Other than that, I just stay in bed, it is too painful to move. I just lie there, take my medication and that’s it.'

During Coach Trip, Mr Middleton was filmed abseiling down a 150ft tower, stilt walking, salsa dancing and tumbling head over heels while grass skiing (pictured above). Mr Middleton was found not guilty of two counts of dishonestly making a false statement to obtain payment between 2005 and 2011

In 2009, Middleton successfully applied for the position of magistrate at Bristol Magistrates' Court, overseeing and determining the outcome in hundreds of cases.

He told the court: 'My condition hadn’t improved from 1999 and 2003 but it allowed me to fulfil my responsibility as a magistrate.

'Sitting as a magistrate was fantastic, it was one of the proudest achievements of my life.'

In 2011, Middleton signed up for Channel 4 show Coach Trip, which required participants to undergo strenuous activities.

He was filmed abseiling down a 150ft tower, stilt walking, salsa dancing and tumbling head over heels while grass skiing on the trip to Poland and Slovakia.

The Department of Work and Pensions began investigating his circumstances after receiving an anonymous tip-off.

Divorcee Mr Middleton, who takes 39 
tablets for his condition, told the court: 'I had reservations to taking
part, they knew my condition.

'I didn’t say no to some things, especially the grass skiing, because I really wanted to do it.'

District
Judge Morgan agreed with his version of events and said she was not 
fully convinced that his active lifestyle had amounted to a 'permanent 
and long-lasting change in his condition'.

She
added that she believed his ability to take part in the activities 
needed careful planning and had not been without consequences.

Mr Middleton told the court: 'I have to do something with my life, you can't just sit and do nothing'

'I’m satisfied the defendant was aware of the legal responsibilities of reporting changes in his condition,' she said.

'Using evidence given to me on the limitations of the defendant's mobility, which his friends witnessed on an almost daily basis, I am drawn to the conclusion that the defendant was able, on the programme Coach Trip, to make a very limited and exceptional effort to participate.

'That is what is shown in the edited programme that was broadcast.

'I’m not satisfied that I’m sure that the broadcasting activities are a representation of his general daily level of his mobility.

'What was broadcast on Channel 4’s Coach Trip was three minutes' total of footage showing the participation in the activities.

'Participants were filmed for 12 hours a day and what was broadcast was highly edited and was selected to make good television.

'The audience do not see the defendant being persuaded to take part and the consequences of his actions.

'I’m not satisfied so I’m sure that the prosecution have satisfied me that those permanent and long-standing changes to his condition have taken place.'

In relation to his salsa dancing, District Judge Morgan said: 'I have found the defendant's role at Salsa Bristol is more of an involvement in the organisation and administration of the club than that of a leading dancer or instructor.

'His technique to teach is passive not active.'

Dismissing his ability to work as a magistrate, she added: 'The magistracy prides itself on being open to anyone of any ability so I do not find that this is a point the court can attach any importance to.'

She said there was no evidence to prove that Mr Middleton had been earning a wage from Salsa Bristol and breached the conditions he was under to gain incapacity allowance.

Mr Middleton was found not guilty of two counts of dishonestly making a false statement to obtain payment between 2005 and 2011.

He declined to comment following the verdict.
