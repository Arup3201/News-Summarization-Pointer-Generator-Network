A Brooklyn woman is distraught after a cold-hearted thief drove off with her Audi with her  tiny Chihuahua puppy  still inside.

Elani Pappas, 23, from Mill Basin said she feels sick that her little dog, Leo, has gone missing and is  desperate to get him back.

‘We just hope that the man didn’t harm him,’ she said. ‘We don’t want the car — we just want Leo.’  

Best friends: Elani Pappas, 23, said she feels sick at the thought of her little dog Leo being taken by the thief

Missing: Leo the Chihuahua was inside the car when the vehicle was stolen at a gas station in Mill Basin 

Pappas pulled into a gas station on Avenue U in Mill Basin for a minute before the car was swiped from right in front of her.

‘My puppy was in the car and I didn’t want him to get cold,’ she said.

She left the car running and went inside the gas station to pay for her gas.

‘It was literally not even a minute,’ Pappas told The New York Post explaining how long she left her  puppy alone.

The 23-year-old legal assistant said: ‘I threw 20 dollars on the attendant’s desk, and I said ‘20 dollars on pump six,’ and as soon as I was walking out I saw the man sitting in my car and he just took off!’

She said:‘I tried to run after him, but he started going like 60 miles an hour.’

Reward: Dozens of family members and friends have helped Pappas to hang up missing posters for the dog

Devastated: Pappas said she wouldn’t care if she did not ever find the car but just wants the dog back

The thief drove  right onto Hill Avenue in Pappas’s dark blue 2010 Audi A4, and disappeared, with Leo barking loudly inside.

‘My dog is like my kid,’ Pappas sobbed.

Dozens of family and friends have helped Pappas to hang up missing posters on Sunday morning.

‘We wouldn’t care if we ever find the car.’
