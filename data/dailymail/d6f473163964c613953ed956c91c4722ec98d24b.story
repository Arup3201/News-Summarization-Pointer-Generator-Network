Nearly three-quarters of all Airbnb rentals in New York City are illegal because they violate zoning regulations and other laws, according to a new report released on Thursday.

Airbnb in the City was compiled by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and has found that commercial operators are abusing the website which promotes itself as part of the ‘sharing economy.’

While Airbnb likes to promote how the service can help homeowners supplement their income and give visitors more usual traveling experiences, the report found that large commercial operators supply more than a third of the units being advertised and generate more than a third of the revenue.

The report, which is based on four years’ worth of data that the attorney general only secured after a court fight, found that a small number of landlords are using the home rental service to run what amount to illegal hostels.

Following the release of the report, Airbnb - which is valued at $10 billion - admitted that better regulation would help ensure it doesn’t become overrun by large-scale commercial operators.

‘We need to work together on some sensible rules that stop bad actors and protect regular people who simply want to share the home in which they live,’ spokesman Nick Papas told the New York Times.

Schneiderman and city regulators are set to announce a new joint enforcement initiative on Thursday to shut illegal hotels down. Regulators will investigate violations of building and safety codes and tax regulations.

‘Anyone operating an illegal hotel should be on notice that the state and city will take aggressive enforcement actions in this area,’ Schneiderman told the Times. 

‘A slick advertising campaign doesn’t change the fact that this is illegal activity.’

Airbnb has said that the vast majority of properties advertised on the site are not ‘illegal hotels’

‘Most of our hosts are regular New Yorkers, and the overwhelming majority live outside of Manhattan,’ said Papas.

He said that New York’s ‘myriad’ of complex housing rules make it difficult to prove the report’s claim that 72 percent of listings were illegal

‘Every single home, apartment, co-op and living space in New York is subject to a myriad of rules, so it’s impossible to make this kind of blanket statement,’ he said. ‘That kind of uncertainty and lack of clarity is exactly why we’re advocating for clear, fair rules for home sharing.’

According to Airbnb only 18 percent of its New York rentals are 'where the hotels are,' which it defines as Midtown Manhattan

According to Airbnb only 18 percent of its New York rentals are 'where the hotels are,' which it defines as Midtown. 

The attorney general’s report found that the most popular rental areas were all in Manhattan - the Lower East Side/Chinatown, Chelsea/Hell’s Kitchen and Greenwich Village/SoHo. These three accounted for 40 percent of private stay revenue, or $187 million.

Reservations in Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx accounted for just 3 percent, or $12 million. 

In April, in the midst of Airbnb’s negotiations with Schneiderman over turning over its data, the company said it was expelling hosts with 2,000 listings in New York because they ‘weren’t providing a quality, local experience to guests.’

A Quinnipiac poll last month revealed that 56 percent of NYC residents agreed that New Yorkers should be able to rent rooms to strangers like a hotel, while 36 percent said no.
