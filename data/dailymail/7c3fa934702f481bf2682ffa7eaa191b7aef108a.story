She's been transformed into some of the most influential beauty icons of the past, from Audrey Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot to Farrah Fawcett and Madonna, but Gwyneth Paltrow has taken it one step further.

The 42-year-old actress, who is the face of Max Factor, has been transformed into a modern interpretation of Marilyn Monroe - and she's barely recognisable thanks to her new look. 

The star was given the makeover in celebration of the 1940’s and to continue the brand's Hollywood legacy.

Guess who? Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, has been treated to a 'modern day' Marilyn Monroe makeover for Max Factor - the beauty brand she is an ambassador for

Rocking a  40’s statement lip and volumised lashes, the brand say that Gwyneth's look is an interpretation of one of the most iconic looks of all time. 

Perhaps Gwyneth is picking up some beauty tips as she prepares to launch her own cosmetics range on Goop.

The firm, which started out as the actress’ personal blog on how to live a ‘whole and healed life’, is set to launch its own range of clothing and beauty products to turn around its flagging fortunes.

Paltrow, 42, has hired American lawyer Lisa Gersh to heal the brand’s image following years of negative publicity.

Spot the difference: Rocking a 40's statement lip and volumised lashes, Gwyneth's look is meant to be an interpretation of one of the most iconic looks of all time, right

Critics have mocked Miss Paltrow’s tendency to champion expensive products such as £46 homemade fishfingers, £3,000 wardrobe essentials and a £15,000-a-week holiday in her favourite French chateau.

Now, as well as giving its 150,000 subscribers tips on fashion, food and décor, it will offer them the chance to buy Goop-branded merchandise.

Miss Gersh, who is now Goop’s chief executive, told the Sunday Times: ‘The good stuff, the lifestyle advice and the travel tips, will still be there. But we will be selling our own Goop brand of clothing and beauty products online.

‘This is a chance to develop a massive new type of e-commerce company that was just not possible when I started out in the 1990s.’

The mother-of-two, who recently split with husband Chris Martin, has shared the Goop pre-holiday cleanse in her most recent blog post, which she promises will provide a 'jumpstart' so you can hit the party circuit in check.

She writes: 'While we usually devote a chunk of January to getting ourselves back on track after the holidays, we thought we’d do things a bit differently this year.

'Have no fear, the annual goop Detox will be waiting to welcome you into the New Year, but we wanted it to feel a little less shocking.'

The clean eater did, however, add: 'If you’re anything like us, you hit the holidays hard - holidays that seem to start earlier and earlier...putting them closer and closer to our summers of over-indulgence.'

So, the stylish A-lister called on her good friend Dr. Junger and his team at Clean to help her put together a healthy eating regime.

It's not the first time! Gwyneth also transformed into iconic Audrey Hepburn for the beauty brand a few months ago 

It includes recipes such as chai gingerbread shake, roasted and clean carrot soup, coconut poached salmon and balsamic miso root salad.

There's also pan-steamed chicken and broccoli and miso sweet potato and broccoli bowl, each featured alongside an artsy and appetising photograph.

Gwyneth adds: 'This is not a full detox - and it’s not difficult. You also don’t need to buy anything special.

'It’s just a way to eat a little bit cleaner and more mindfully, while giving the wine bottle a bit of time off before it takes center stage. (We’ll be doing it with you @goop, starting on Monday November 10th' and adds the hashtag #goopcleanse to encourage her followers to get involved on social media.
