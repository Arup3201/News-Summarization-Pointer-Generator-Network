While she is no stranger to being in cuffs, Lindsay Lohan has passed judgement on her own father's arrest.

The 25-year-old actress, whose father Michael was taken into custody yesterday, told her fans 'it's about time'.

Lindsay, who today completed the remaining eight hours of her work at the morgue, also told her mother Dina that she loved her in the tweet.

She posted: 'Unfortunately.... Its about time he got 'served' I love you *mommy/calm*& @jazejazz7.'

Around the same time her father emerged from jail after posting bail, Lindsay emerged from the LA County Morgue after working her second gruelling day shift.

It's no surprising there is little love lost between Lindsay and her father after he recently accused her of taking crystal meth while discussing her court appearance on TV earlier this month.

The Mean Girls actress undertook another day of community service at the LA County Morgue - and got back to work scrubbing toilets, washing floor and cleaning up after autopsies.

She left the morgue with expensive handbag over her head as she returned home, probably thankful she has completed the 16 hours ordered before her next court appearance on November 2.

And it appeared that one designer bag was not enough for the actress who took a £3,000 Fendi bag as well as a £1,000 YSL purse to her community service.

Lindsay was pictured this morning reporting for duty, looking scruffy in a beanie hat, a green hoodie, black trousers and shades.

It was a far cry from her glamorous day yesterday, when she stripped down for a reported $1m Playboy photoshoot at a Beverly Hills mansion.

According to TMZ, Lindsay posed for full frontal shots for the magazine. Radar.com claims the actress only took part in the magazine spread because she is concerned about her dwindling finances and is desperate to earn more money.

While Lindsay is seeking atonement by way of community service for shoplifting a necklace earlier this year, her father Michael was today hauled before a court on charges of domestic
violence after allegedly assaulting his live-in girlfriend Kate Major.

A Florida judge set bail at $5,000 for 
the 51-year-old, who police claim threatened to smash Major's cell phone and throw her from a fourth-floor balcony.

Michael was seen leaving jail after posting bail and gave the 'thumbs up' sign to photographers.

Meanwhile, the drama continues to unfold for Lindsay.

Pictures have emerged this morning of
the troubled star arriving back at her Venice Beach house last night 
after celebrating her bumper pay day at Hollywood's Chateau Marmont.

Lindsay was snapped sprawled across the floor after her garage door closed on her, sending her tumbling to the ground.

However the actress managed to stay 
on her cell phone during the entire mishap, as well as keep hold of her 
black hat and cigarette.

Lindsay's
ultra high wedge fringe boots probably didn't help the actress keep her
balance as she made her undignified trip, ending up next to a bicycle 
and some boxes.

She 
looked a little worse for wear in black jeans and a white silk shirt, 
with her bleached blonde hair pulled into a scruffy bun.

In any case, she still managed a bright and early start this morning.

At her court hearing last week, Lohan was ordered to complete 16 hours at the morgue ahead of her next appearance on November 2.

Family tradition: Lindsay's father Michael was hauled before a Florida court today on domestic violence charges, exactly a week after his daughter's appearance before a judge in LA

It
came after Judge Stephanie Sautner revoked her probation in relation to
her necklace theft earlier this year because the actress failed to turn
up nine times to the Downtown Women's Center - a shelter for homeless 
women where Lohan had been ordered to perform community service.

Lohan still faces going back to jail when she next returns to court if the judge formally rules she breached her probation.

The Mean Girls star did her first stint at the morgue on Friday, after arriving late and being turned away the day before.

Yesterday Lindsay made her way to a swish Beverly Hills mansion for the racy photo shoot for Hugh Hefner's famous publication.

The star was described by 
onlookers as being in 'such a good mood' when she left the swanky 
Château Marmont after spending five hours celebrating her Playboy shoot. 

Lindsay's mother Dina told X17Online.com that: 'The photo shoot went well.'

Sources told TMZ that the shoot has been in the works for months, with Lindsay 
refusing the initial $750,000 in favour of a higher price.

The high-money offer is in stark 
contrast to the gritty reality of scrubbing toilets and washing soiled 
linens at the Los Angeles County morgue where she was this morning.

Lindsay arrived at 6.50 am in a Cadillac with her assistant and driver, according to Rumorfix.com.

Lindsay has been ordered to complete 16 hours between now and her next court appearance on November 2.

Judge Stephanie Saunter ordered the punishment last Wednesday following the Lindsay's most recent court appearance.

The
judge was riled after discovering the star had failed to complete 480 
hours of community service she was ordered to complete as part of her 
sentence for the theft of a gold necklace earlier this year.

Lindsay was handcuffed and taken into custody before later posting $100,000 bail.
