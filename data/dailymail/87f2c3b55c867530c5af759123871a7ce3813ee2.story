Hull defender Alex Bruce will be out for up to a month after injuring his hamstring.

After a spell out of the side, Bruce returned for the Tigers in their 0-0 draw at Liverpool last month and was expected to keep his place for Saturday's home clash against Southampton.

But he went down at the end of the final pre-match training session and missed the match.

The 30-year-old will also be unavailable for Northern Ireland's Euro 2016 qualifier in Romania on November 14, though it is understood he was not in the provisional squad.

'Alex got injured in training on Friday, one of the last kicks of the session,' manager Steve Bruce told Hull's official website.

'It's a hamstring but we don't think it's too serious. It's probably going to be two, three or four weeks.'
