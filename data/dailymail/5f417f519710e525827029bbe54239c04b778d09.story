A British student has been killed in France today and another badly injured as they tried to cross a busy motorway to get to a nightclub.

One of the victims, aged 23, died at the scene, while a second, aged 22, was 'wounded in the legs', according to a police source in the southern city of Montpellier.Â 

The pair - who have not yet been named - had been part of a group of six friends trying to make their way to a nightclub in the city, which is hugely popular with British students.

They are believed to have been struck by a car.

A driver was arrested shortly after the incident, which happened at about 1.25am.

The students were last seen in the central reservation of the three-lane A9 motorway, which runs between Orange, near Avignon, and the Spanish border.

'The fatal accident happened on the main motorway, which was briefly closed shortly afterwards,' said a police source.

'It is thought that the car hit the two students as they tried to get across one of the carriageways.

'The second victim was badly injured, 
but the leg injuries are not life threatening. The victim was taken to 
the university hospital in Montpellier.'

He added: 'We are unable to release the names of the victims until their families in England have been informed.'

The driver of the car, who is in his 30s, was treated for shock at the same hospital. He has now been formally placed under criminal investigation.

A spokesman for local prosecutors said the suspect - who has not yet been named - was being questioned on suspicion of 'manslaughter and causing injuries' in a police station in Montpellier.

He said results of tests for alcohol and drugs were not yet known.
