In the late 18th century, the well-heeled came in their droves to admire the views along the Wye Valley.

The lush countryside of Monmouthshire, in south-east Wales, proved an irresistible draw for such luminaries as poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Nelson and Lady Hamilton.

As they embarked upon their trek - possibly inspired by Rev William Gilpin's book Observations On The River Wye - they would have come across Piercefield House, a beautiful country retreat to the north of Chepstow.

Designed by British architect John Soane, it was commissioned in 1785 by Durham banker George Smith, and was heralded as a neoclassical masterpiece... but today, it lies in ruins.

The three-storey property is to the north of Chepstow in Monmouthshire, south-east Wales

In its heyday, the three-storey estate proudly overlooked 129 acres of parkland - enhanced by a series of picturesque walks laid out in the 1750s by Valentine Morris, the son of a sugar plantation owner from Antigua

The latter purchased the property from Smith after he went bankrupt.

After passing through several owners - and serving as a base for U.S. troops to conduct D-Day Landings exercises in 1944 - it was bought by billionaire businessmen brothers David and Simon Reuben, albeit indirectly through a subsidiary company.

No one is quite sure why the brothers allowed the house to fall into disrepair.

Sir John Soane (right) was the son of a bricklayer who rose to become professor of architecture at the Royal Academy.

He specialised in the neoclassical style of design and his architectural works are distinguished by their clean lines,  decisive detailing, careful proportions and skilful use of light.

The influence of his work, coming at the end of the Georgian era, was swamped by the revival styles of the 19th century. It was not until the late 19th century that his influence was widely felt.

His best-known work was the Bank of England, a building which had a widespread effect on commercial architecture.

He also designed Dulwich Picture Gallery, which, with its top-lit galleries, was a major influence on the planning of subsequent art galleries and museums.

His main legacy is Sir John Soane's Museum, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London.

He received a knighthood in 1831, six years before his death at the age of 84. 

London-based art dealer Edward Strachan attempted to buy Piercefield when it was put up for sale two years ago, offering £1million.

The offer was rejected - and adding £300,000 to his bid made no difference. The Reubens declined to comment on the matter.

Now, the house is firmly on the radar of a conservation group which is determined to save the Grade II*-listed building from further decay.

Campaigners from Save Britain's Heritage are hoping to acquire a CPO (Compulsory Purchase Order) or possibly turn the house over to a trust.

Marcus Binney, co-founder and 
president of Save told the Daily Telegraph: 'Edward's was a handsome 
offer. Piercefield really is an important house.

'It's
a fine early work by Soane wrapped around an older Baroque house that 
might have been by William Talman [Sir Christopher Wren's assistant], 
and there's evidence the house has Tudor or even earlier origins.

'It's also hugely important in terms of the Romantic movement and, because of its location, it's truly a gateway to Wales.'

SInce Piercefield is listed as a 
ruin, Cadw, the Welsh government's historic environment service, is 
unable to serve an order for repairs on the owners.

However, hope remains if other Soane 
house are anything to go by: Tyringham Hall in Buckinghamshire and Pell 
Well in Shropshire are among those that have recently been saved.

Among
the Reubens' companies is Arena Racing. Its portfolio includes Chepstow
racecourse, whose track is on land that was once part of the 
Piercefield estate.

A 
source close to the Chepstow Racecourse Ltd told the Telegraph that no 
realistic offer has been made for the house: 'Over the past two years, 
the only people who've expressed an interest are conservationists.

'If anyone wants to make a serious offer, they're welcome to contact the company direct.'
