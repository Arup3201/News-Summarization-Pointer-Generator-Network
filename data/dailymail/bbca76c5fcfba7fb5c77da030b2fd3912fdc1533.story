Spending by overseas visitors to the UK is expected to hit record levels next year with London leading the way as one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations.

According to forecasts from VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, spending is likely to reach £22bn in 2015 and will likely top out at £21.3bn in 2014 after passing £20bn for the first time in 2013.

As tourists spend more money across the UK, the number of overseas visitors is expected to rise to 35.1 million next year, up 2.5 per cent on 2014.

The UK had 29.8 million visitors in 2010, but that was before worldwide interest in Britain hit new heights with the marriage of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, and the London Olympics and Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said: ‘The tourism sector is driving economic growth for Britain. The Olympic Games and Diamond Jubilee gave us a great platform to showcase the best of Britain but we didn't stop there and have kept up the momentum in the last two years.

‘Britain has so much to offer tourists with our stunning countryside, great heritage and world-class sport and culture. Working closely with the tourism industry we will continue to champion the UK abroad as part of our long-term economic plan.’

In recent months, tourism bosses have launched publicity campaigns to lure tourists from China and Mexico.

Growth from Chinese tourists – the world’s most lucrative market – has been particularly strong in the last four years. They spent £492million in 2013, up from £184million in 2010.

Over that period the number of visits from Chinese people rose by 79.1 per cent to 196,000.

The government is encouraging more visitors from Mexico to come to Britain in 2015, which is also the Year of Mexico, in which both countries have partnered to showcase their best culture, arts and creative industries.

The number of visits from Mexicans has climbed from 67,000 in 2010 to 108,000 in 2013.

Visitors from the US are still the biggest spenders in the UK, splashing out £2.5bn in 2013, an increase of 19.4 per cent on 2010.

Spending by visitors from France (up 18 per cent to £1.35bn) and Germany (up 18 per cent to £1.4bn) also grew strongly in the four years to 2013.

The French visit Britain the most, with 3.9 million visits in 2013 while Germany is second, with 3.1 million visits in 2013.

Overall, spending by overseas visitors rose from £16.8bn in 2010 to more than £20bn in 2013.

VisitBritain chief executive Sally Balcombe said: ‘Tourism will continue to be one of the country's major export earners with VisitBritain playing a critical role in its success.

‘One of our priorities for 2015 will be to inspire international visits to the nations and regions and showcase Britain's magnificent countryside.

‘In 2010 total spend from overseas visitors was £16.8 billion from 29.8 million trips that shows how well the tourism sector has performed in the last four years and how the government's tourism strategy, supported by the GREAT campaign, has worked.’
