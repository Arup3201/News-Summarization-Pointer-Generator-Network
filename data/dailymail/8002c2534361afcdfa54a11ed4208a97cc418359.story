Hero: Paul DeSousa, 27, (photographed) was hit by a car after pulling a teen boy out of harm's way when an out-of-control vehicle came hurtling toward them Friday.

A New York police officer was hit by a car after pulling a teen boy out of harm's way when an out-of-control vehicle came hurtling toward them Friday.

Westchester County police say Officer Paul DeSousa, 27, was treated and released from a hospital after the rescue Friday morning. 

The officer was struck just before 10am, CBS reports.  He saw a 15-year-old boy walking along a Yonkers parkway and feared the boy would be hit by a car during the morning's snow storm.

He pulled over and was offering the boy a ride when an 2014 Infiniti lost control in the center lane, NBC reports. 

The vehicle struck an embankment and then hurtled toward the officer and the teen.

DeSousa had to think fast.

He grabbed the boy and hoisted him onto the hood of his squad car. DeSousa was then struck in the leg, The Journal News reports, and sent flying into the air. 

DeSousa managed to radio for help as witnesses rushed to help the officer, police say. He was taken to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx with back and neck injuries.  

The teen wasn't injured.

Investigated: The crash was still being investigated Friday evening but the driver, an unnamed woman, was not charged with any wrongdoing

The crash was still being investigated Friday evening but the driver, an unnamed woman, was not charged with any wrongdoing.

Kieran O'Leary, police spokesman, said the woman was most likely going the speed limit, but may have been going a bit faster than the hazardous weather permitted, according to the Journal.

DeSousa is being hailed as a hero by Westchester County public safety officials for the bravery he exhibited Friday morning.

Injuries: DeSousa was treated for minor back and neck injuries and released from a hospital after the rescue Friday morning

Police say Desousa joined the Westchester County Department of Public Safety a year ago after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
