Two convicted Islamic extremists who were deported from Britain in 2012 have emerged as jihadis fighting for ISIS in Iraq - one as a senior commander, and the other as a suicide bomber.

Christian Emde, 30, and Robert Baum, 25, were convicted of entering the UK in possession of computers filled with radical material, including a chilling document explaining how to make bombs.

The German nationals, who are both Muslim converts from the city of Solingen, were remanded at Belmarsh high security prison awaiting trial and, upon being convicted, the Home Office was able to send them back to Germany to serve their respective 16 and 12 month jail sentences.

It has now emerged, however, that both men subsequently made their way to join the Islamic State  in Iraq - with Emde a senior commander based in the terror group's stronghold Mosul, and Baum a suicide bomber who ISIS claimed had blown himself up in a sickening recent propaganda video.

Details of Emde's rise within ISIS emerged when maverick German journalist Juergen Todenhoefer recently spent 10 days with ISIS in Mosul - the oil rich city in north west Iraq which was captured and occupied by the terrorists in June of this year.

Remarkable footage taken within the city shows how everyday life is continuing within the city, despite the militants enforcing a brutal interpretation of Sharia law, deliberately destroying ancient buildings and monuments and forcing Christians to either convert, pay a tax, or face execution.

Although hundreds of thousands of persecuted locals have fled the area over the past few months, Todenhoefer has spent that time in deep online conversation with representatives of terror leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and was eventually granted permission to travel to Mosul.

The journalist was provided with written assurances that he would come to no harm during his visit and fighters gave him a guided tour around the city - including visiting the Mosul mosque where al-Baghdadi famously gave a public sermon upon his self-declaration as a new caliph.

While many of the jihadis tell of their experiences fighting for the Islamic State, one calling himself Abu Malik al-Almani speaks with greater authority on behalf of the terror group's leadership, and details ISIS' future strategies and chilling plans to expand into Europe.

This man is Emde, the former radical convicted of bringing computers laden with terror material into Britian - including a copy of the official Al Qaeda magazine Inspire which featured an eight-page article titled 'How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom'.

Militant: Wearing a bobble hat and spectacles, clean-shaven Robert Baum could easily be mistaken for any bookish young Westerner. That is until he points at a detonator on his vest and utters the chilling phrase: 'With a press of the button, everything blows up'. Later in the ISIS video he carries out a suicide attack

Speaking to Todenhoefer in a video report published by CNN, Emde vowed that ISIS would soon bring their campaign of brutality and persecution to Europe. 

'We will conquer Europe one day. It is not a question of if we will conquer Europe, just a matter of when that will happen. But it is certain,' he said. 

'And the Europeans need to know that when we come, it will not be in a nice way. It will be with our weapons. And those who do not convert to Islam or pay the Islamic tax will be killed,' he added. 

'Our expansion will be perpetual... For us, there is no such thing as borders. There are only front lines,' Emde went on to say.

When asked about ISIS' treatment of those practicing other religions, the militant said the terror group will 'kill them all', adding: '150 million, 200 million or 500 million, it does not matter to us'.

His shocking views on ISIS' barbaric practice of taking female sex slaves was equally barbaric.

'I would say that slavery is a great help to us and we will continue to have slavery and beheadings, it is part of our religion ... many slaves have converted to Islam and have then been freed.'

On the subject of ISIS' filming their savage beheading of Western journalists and aid workers, Emde said: 'People should really think about the case of James Foley...He did not get killed because we started the battle. He got killed because of the ignorance of his government that did not give him any help.'

Tour: The journalist was provided with written assurances that he would come to no harm during his visit and fighters gave him a guided tour around the city - including visiting the Mosul mosque where terror leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) famously gave a public sermon upon his self-declaration as a new caliph

Stronghold: Although American airstrikes continue to bombard ISIS targets, Todenhoefer thinks the militants are unlikely to be defeated in Mosul (pictured) anytime soon

Emde's shocking comments came just weeks after his partner in crime Robert Baum reportedly appeared in a sickening suicide bomb attack that ISIS filmed and released online in a five-minute long propaganda video titled 'Our State is Victorious'.

Wearing a knitted bobble hat and spectacles, clean-shaven Baum could easily be mistaken for any bookish young Westerner until he points at a detonator on his suicide vest and utters the chilling phrase: 'With a press of the button, everything blows up.'

The video then cuts to a scene showing an explosion and the vehicle in which Baum - who called himself by the noms de guerre Abu Uthman or Abu Sara al-Almani - had been travelling is seen as a fireball.

The sickening attack came just two years after Baum converted to Islam in the same German city, Solinger, as his friend Emde. The pair quickly became embroiled in the more radical side of the religion and, after leaving prison following his British conviction, lived a radical mosque in the city.

When the group was banned later in 2012, many of its members reportedly went to Egypt to support the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. At some point over the next two years, both Emde and Baum instead travelled to Syria where they waged jihad on behalf of the Islamic State.

Caliphate: A map purportedly showing the areas ISIS plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online. As well as the Middle East, North Africa and large areas of Asia, it also reveals ISIS' ambition to extend into Europe. Spain, which was Muslim-ruled until the late 15th Century, would form part of the caliphate, as would the Balkan states and eastern Europe, up to and including Austria

Todenhoefer's incredible journey to visit the ISIS-held city of Mosul was the result of months of negotiations via Skype with the terror group's senior leadership.

Having previously written articles critical of ISIS, Todenhoefer demanded written assurances that he would not come to harm and, astonishingly, the terror group kept their word.

Upon return the journalist told how ISIS is a larger and more united force than is widely believed in the West, and said he was concerned America and Britain had underestimated the jihadis.

Todenhoefer said that he stayed in a recruitment house where 50 new foreign fighters arrived every single day, and was introduced to militants who claimed their success is driven by their not fearing death, while their enemies - including the Iraqi army - do not have the stomach for the battle.

In one heartbreaking encounter a young boy clad in ISIS' black uniform identifies himself as being just 13-years-old. Although his smiling face is one of innocence, the assault rifle in his hands points to a dramatically different future for this young jihadi-in-training. 

Although American airstrikes continue to bombard ISIS targets ahead on an expected Iraqi army spring offensive to force the terrorists out of their strongholds, Todenhoefer thinks the militants are unlikely to be defeated anytime soon.

'I think the Islamic State is a lot more dangerous than Western leaders realize... They believe in what they are fighting for and are preparing the largest religious cleansing campaign the world has ever seen,' he said.
