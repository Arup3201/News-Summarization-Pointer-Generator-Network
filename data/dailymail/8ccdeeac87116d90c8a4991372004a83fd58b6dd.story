Phil Parkinson hailed a result to put Bradford City back on the footballing map as the League One side stormed back from two goals down to dump Premier League leaders Chelsea out the FA Cup.

The City manager set his sights on Manchester United in the next round after an incredible comeback at Stamford Bridge left Jose Mourinho’s hopes of the ‘Quadruple’ in tatters.

Trailing to first-half goals from Gary Cahill and Ramires, a terrific strike from Jon Stead shortly before the break gave them hope and second-half goals from Filipe Morais, Andy Halliday and Mark Yeates ensured a famous win against all the odds.

And Parkinson, who guided the then-League Two side to the League Cup final in 2013, reckoned this result was every bit as good.

‘It has put Bradford on the map again,’ said Parkinson. ‘Two years ago we did that and today we have got a lot of people talking about Bradford again.

‘When we were on the pitch at the end celebrating, it did feel a bit surreal. We’ve come to the league leaders and scored four goals.

‘It’s a great feeling and it will be remembered in Bradford for a long time and the rest of the country as well. It was a great performance from the lads, we were disciplined throughout and we always carried a threat going forward.

‘We’re at our best when we’re positive and we showed that today. To be 2-0 down, the heads never dropped. As much as the goals were highlights, the honesty and the discipline of the performance was brilliant.’

The thrilling 4-2 win sent Bradford’s 6,000 travelling fans at Stamford Bridge into dreamland and Parkinson hopes another glamorous tie awaits.

‘If Man United get through against Cambridge, I’d love to have a go at them,’ he said.

‘I’m sure if we went to Old Trafford, we’d have 15,000 fans there. It was like a home game in the second-half and I’m just so pleased for every one of them.’
