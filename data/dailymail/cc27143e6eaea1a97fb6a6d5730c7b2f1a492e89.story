'Cureable': Errol Denton is said to have used Twitter and his own website to boast that the diseases were curable

A Harley Street practitioner is being prosecuted for allegedly claiming he could cure cancer and HIV.

Errol Denton is said to have used Twitter and his own website to boast that the diseases  were curable with ‘lifestyle changes and herbs’.

He also advised women not to wear bras as a tip for fending off ‘acidity’ in the breasts, Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told.

The case is a rare prosecution under the Cancer Act 1939, which prohibits advertisements offering to treat or to cure cancer.

Denton – who calls himself a ‘non-medical doctor’ – used his personal Twitter account to claim ‘Cancer, diabetes, HIV, etc etc, all curable without the big pharmaceuticals’,  it is alleged.

His website, livebloodtest.com, advertises a form of blood test involving ‘a very powerful microscope’, used to detect ‘imbalances’.

The court heard one article claimed: ‘I have advised women for years not to wear bras.

‘When they return for a blood test, the results show a reduction of acidity in the breast area.’

Further passages on the website read: ‘Wake up to the fact that cancer is a disease caused by lifestyle and as such is curable by lifestyle changes and herbs.

‘Natural cancer cures are being suppressed in order to cull population growth.’

Denton, who represented himself, at first refused to confirm his name to District Judge Andrew Sweet.

‘I’m not “Mr” Errol Denton. I’m Errol of the Denton family, not ‘Mr’, the corporate fiction,’ he said.

‘I am a living soul, I have inalienable rights. I am here by special invitation.’

Prosecutor Alexandra Ward opened the case for Westminster City Council, ignoring frequent cries of ‘objection’ from Denton. She said Denton was the manager of a company called Live Blood Test which rented a room at No 1 Harley Street.

‘Mr Denton operates from there regularly,’ she said. ‘He regularly uses the internet to post advertisements of his website and through Twitter, as well as blogging sites to advertise his microscopy service in relation to this blood test. 

'Wake up to the fact that cancer is a disease caused by lifestyle and as such is curable by lifestyle changes and herbs': Denton's claims have lead him to be prosecuted under the Cancer Act 1939

‘In part, it is suggested it could assist with the treatment of cancer,’ Miss Ward said.

Denton, however, claimed he did not write the articles, adding: ‘They were done by a corporate entity not based in the UK.’

He claims that various websites bearing his name are run by a Dubai-based company.

‘My representation has been damaged by internet agitators. They are the ones who made the complaint. They are sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies,’ he claimed.

Denton, of, Woodford Green, east London, denies nine breaches of  the Cancer Act. The trial will resume in March.
