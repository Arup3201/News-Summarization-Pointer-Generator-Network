A Polish burglar battered and stabbed an elderly couple to death at their home – a week after arriving in the UK to stay with his sister in the house next door.

In a tragic irony, his victims were also immigrants to this country who, by contrast, had worked hard and built a model family life in Wolverhampton following their arrival from Italy more than 50 years ago.

Killer Ireneusz Bartnowski, 22, watched grandparents Guiseppe and Caterina Massaro’s movements for several days before breaking in to their home while they were out shopping.

When they returned, he lay in wait in 
their bedroom for ten hours until Mr Massaro, 80, and his 77-year-old 
wife retired to bed, then attacked them with a knife and a foot-long 
hammer.

Yesterday Bartnowski, who tried to 
blame a fellow Pole for the killings, was jailed for life with a minimum
tariff of 34 years after being convicted of the double murder.

Mr Justice MacDuff told him: ‘You lack
all humanity, you are evil beyond belief. You have told this court 
breathtaking lies in an attempt to escape justice.

‘You showed no mercy, no compassion. 
You left them dead upon their bedroom floor and you set about stripping 
them of their valuables. This was a cold-blooded murder. Yours was an 
intention to kill. You knew you had no intention but to end their 
lives.’

The judge said he had been ‘moved almost to tears’ by the Massaro family’s suffering.

Bartnowski, an ex-soldier, had been convicted of burglary in his homeland four years ago and given a suspended sentence.

But despite the conviction he had open
access to the UK as a citizen of the European Union, under free 
movement directives which stipulate that only the most serious offenders
can be turned away. He arrived in Britain by bus in April.

Last night, Mr Massaro’s sister 
condemned the regulations and told the Daily Mail the Polish criminal 
‘should never have been allowed in to the country’.

Luisa Mastrobuono said: ‘He’s a 
convicted criminal. If he’s committed crimes in one country then he will
do it again in another country.’

The victims’ granddaughter Lindsey 
Booth, 24, who found their bodies on Good Friday last year, said: ‘We 
hope in prison he gets what he truly deserves and is subjected to the 
very pain, violence and fear my grandparents were subjected to.

‘We hope the very moments that have confined him will torment and disturb his corrupted mind every moment of every day.’

She said of the ‘vile’ killer’s 
sentence: ‘The death penalty would have been the easy way out for 
Bartnowski. We would rather have him suffering for what he has done for 
every day of his sentence.’

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the 
Italian couple – who moved to the city from Naples in 1960 – were found 
side by side by Miss Booth on the floor of the bedroom.

They are believed to have been 
attacked the previous evening. Following the attack, Bartnowski was 
caught on CCTV loading his victims’ two televisions – later sold for 
£200 – into their Peugeot car and driving away.

A short time later he was recorded 
buying beer in a nearby Asda. The next morning he was twice filmed by a 
CCTV camera returning to the property to search for ‘further pickings’. 
It could not be established what, if any, valuables he took.

Peter Grieves-Smith, QC, prosecuting, 
said that Mr Massaro, a factory worker before his retirement, or his 
wife would have seen the other being attacked and would have known ‘the 
same thing would happen to them’.

Mr Massaro received blunt and sharp 
force injuries to his head, neck and abdomen, with two areas of skull 
fracturing caused by the hammer, which led to haemorrhaging of the 
brain.

His wife had stab wounds to the neck as well as defensive injuries.

Bartnowski’s fingerprints and blood 
were found on the murder weapons and his DNA in a pair of gloves and on a
pear he had taken a bite from in the kitchen. Mr Massaro’s DNA was 
recovered from trainers found at Bartnowski’s sister’s home.

But the killer tried to pin the double
killing on a 32-year-old fellow Pole, Wojciech Ostolski, telling the 
jury: ‘I did not kill them. I was downstairs when it happened. I did not
want to know what he had done to the old folks.’

Ostolski, of Wolverhampton, a father 
of two who came to England in 2006, denied handling the stolen property 
from the Massaros’ home and was cleared by the jury.

Philip Davies, the Eurosceptic Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘This sort of incident is sickening.

‘Being an island nation, we should 
have an advantage in terms of controlling who comes through our borders 
but through our membership of the European Union we have tossed that 
advantage away to the point that we don’t know who has come in to the 
country. The consequences of that, as in this case, can be incredibly 
serious.’

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: 
‘Public protection is our number one priority. We will not accept 
foreign criminals breaking UK laws and will seek to deport any European 
national who commits a serious offence.’
