She has already admitted that on the eve of her Victoria's Secret runway debut, she opted for a McDonald's lunch and pizza dinner.

And despite claiming that she does 
'nothing' to prepare for her catwalk appearances due to a hectic work 
schedule, the size 6 Cara Delevingne always looks incredibly slim.

Now the 5ft 9in model of the year has given girls worldwide even more reason to envy her after taking to Twitter to expressing her love for fast food once more.

The 21-year-old was snapped on the social networking site by best friend Rita Ora gorging on a hamburger.

Rita asked: 'Was the burger nice?' to which petite Cara replied: 'Was delicious!'.

Her previous tweet showed a full McDonalds meal on her lap with the caption: 'First thing I do when I get to America... get a Mcdonalds'.

Talking to Beauty High around the time of the Victoria's Secret show that cemented her place as one of the world's top models she said: 'I need to eat a lot otherwise I feel faint. I get in the worst moods if I don’t eat'.

And it seems she isn't the only genetically blessed model that loves a good calorie-laden meal.

Cara's good friend and fellow model Jourdan Dunn proved she doesn't live on a diet of lettuce and water in the latest episode of her cooking show Well Dunn.

The show, which appears on Jay-Z‘s Life + Times YouTube channel, shows Dunn cooking up hot chicken wings with lashing of Frank’s RedHot sauce before leaving them to sizzle in the deep fat fryer.

Speaking on the show, she said: 'I always get so excited cooking chicken wings.

'I don’t know, because it’s chicken wings! I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like chicken wings. You say chicken wings and everyone’s like "What, what? Chicken wings? I’m there."

'Chicken wings and beer, chicken and beer. Perfect.'
