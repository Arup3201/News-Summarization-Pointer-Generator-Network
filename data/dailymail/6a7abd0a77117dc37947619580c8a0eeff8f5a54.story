Darren Fletcher sealed a deadline day move to West Bromwich Albion from Manchester United, where he has linked up with his former Old Trafford team-mate Ben Foster.

The Scotland captain is a welcome reinforcement in the midfield of Tony Pulis' squad and Foster has been giving the lowdown on exactly what he will bring to the side.

'It's great for the club - he fits perfectly into the ethos of what we want here,' Foster said to the club's official website. 'We built our foundations on players like that - hard working, good quality, honest, a player you can rely on.
