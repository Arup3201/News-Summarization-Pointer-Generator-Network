A nurse who breathed on a critically ill baby while she was suffering from a throat infection and said the newborn was ‘better off dead’ faces being struck off.

Claire Orton giggled after exhaling onto the 'extremely poorly' child while it was being treated at University Hospital in Coventry, Warwickshire, a tribunal heard.

She had told colleagues she had been ill with a throat infection before she deliberately breathed on the infant’s face as if to infect him, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing was told.

Orton was being investigated by Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust over a separate incident when the allegations over 'Baby B' came to light.

Colleague Daniel Top told the panel how he was shocked after Orton made the insensitive comments - which came while she under investigation for allegedly leaving a student nurse to look after a poorly baby, despite being unqualified to do so.

Robin Somerville, NMC panel chair, said the panel believed Mr Top's evidence.

He said: ‘Mr Top demonstrated to the panel what he said he saw.

‘This consisted of a sharp exhalation directly onto Baby B’s face. He added that you had then walked away and giggled.

‘The panel believed this evidence.

‘The panel understood that there was an undoubted sense of strain on the ward as a result of Baby B’s situation.

‘In these circumstances, the panel considers that your remark was not intended maliciously but as an expression of an opinion to any colleagues who were in the vicinity.’

Orton previously told the panel that her breathing on the baby might have been mistaken for her ‘sighing’ at the sadness of the baby’s condition. 

Orton could be struck off as a nurse at University Hospital in Coventry, Warwickshire (pictured) if her fitness to practice is found to be impaired. The Nursing and Midwifery Council tribunal into the allegations continues

In the earlier incident, the nurse was found to have failed to call assistance to a student nurse who was left in care of another sick baby on 2 July 2012.

She was accused of not responding promptly to Jade Matthews's calls for help while the child was suffering from brachycardia - a low resting heart rate.

Orton accepts that a doctor was not called and that she failed to record any notes about the incident.

She later admitted she should not have allowed the student nurse to look after the baby, but thought it was a good learning experience.

Orton denies inappropriately breathing on Baby B's face and saying the child would be 'better off dead.'

If her fitness to practice is found to be impaired, she could be struck off.

The hearing continues.
