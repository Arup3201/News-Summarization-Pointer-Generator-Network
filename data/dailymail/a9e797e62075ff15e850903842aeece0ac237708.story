Phil Neville has paid glowing tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson and revealed how the legendary former Manchester United manager encouraged him to play cricket during the off-season.

Neville spoke about his love of the summer game while a guest on the BBC's Test Match Special programme at lunch on the second day of the fourth Investec Test between England and India at Old Trafford.

A talented batsman, Neville was a contemporary of Andrew Flintoff at Lancashire and captained England at Under 15 level before deciding to concentrate full-time on football.

And a big factor in the decision was Ferguson, who put him on the path to a glittering Old Trafford career that saw him win six Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the Champions League alongside brother Gary.

'He was the best manager in terms of making you feel special,' Neville told TMS. 'Gary sometimes needed that kick up the backside, sometimes needed bringing back down to earth.

'With me, it was more of a wink or a tap on the shoulder. I never got the hairdryer - well, maybe once.

'He would only give you the hairdryer if there was a problem with your attitude. If you played badly, he would put his arm around you.

'He had an unbelievable quality of knowing, at just the right time, when to talk to you.

'He was the type of manager that when you went in for a new contract and asked for £150 more in wages, you would come out having signed the same contract and thanking him for it.'

Hero: Phil Neville made 386 appearances in all for Manchester United in 11 years at the club

Neville left Old Trafford back in 2005, joining Everton in a deal worth £3.5m, and would go on to captain the team and make 303 appearances.

But even then, Ferguson continued to have an influence on his career.

Neville, who will be part of the Match of the Day punditry team this season, said: 'When I left United, he told me which club to join and what to do and said 'one day you'll be back at Old Trafford.'

'It was not just Fergie the manager, he had a strong bond with his players and a very human side.

'He was brilliant at decision making, knowing the right players to sell at the right time. He slowly built a new team without us.'

Neville worked as first-team coach to David Moyes at United last season but will not be part of Louis van Gaal's backroom staff.

He has recently bought non-league club Salford City alongside brother Gary and fellow Class of '92 members Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt.

They played with invited guests in a charity match against Salford on Thursday night, losing 5-1 at the AJ Bell Stadium.

Among those on the Class of '92 team were former cricketers Michael Vaughan and Steve Harmison.

Neville said both 'did ok' in the fundraising match though Vaughan 'fluffed a good chance' and Harmison played 'like Tony Adams in the nineties'.

He added: 'I have never seen a centre-back play so far forward.'

Neville compared facing a ball of 90mph in cricket to playing football at an intimidating venue like Anfield or Galatasaray's old Ali Sami Yen ground.

And it seems Ferguson was more than happy to see a young Neville toughened up by facing the quick bowlers in the summer months.

'Ferguson encouraged me to play cricket,' he said. 'He didn't like cricket or understand cricket but he was fine with me playing it.'
