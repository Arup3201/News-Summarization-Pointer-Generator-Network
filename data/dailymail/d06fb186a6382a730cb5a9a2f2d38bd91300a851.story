A teenager on probation told police he struck his girlfriend’s young son Friday night after the boy wouldn’t stop crying, resulting in the toddler's death.

Tyree Wright, 19, who was arrested five times before for assault and robbery charges, reportedly told police that while babysitting 23-month-old Jacquil Degraffenreid for his girlfriend, he struck the boy twice.

The boy’s mother, 21-year-old Natalie Garner received a call from Wright around 9pm Friday night to say that her son was sick.

Ms Garner had apparently left her son in Wright’s care while she went to work at her catering job.

By the time she returned to Wright’s home on Shepard Avenue in Cypress Hills around 2am, she told police that Jaquil was acting sluggishly and lost consciousness, the New York Post reported.

That’s when Ms Garner called 911, sources told the paper.

Jaquil was taken to Kings County Hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. The autopsy report says his cause of death was caused by ‘lacerations of the liver and pancreas with internal hemorrhage due to blunt-impact injuries.’

Authorities are still investigating what caused the toddler’s injuries.

Doctors told police they also found bruising on the boy’s forehead and torso.

Wright was charged with felony assault and acting in a manner injurious to a child, though it is likely that the charges will be upped to murder, a spokesman for the Kings County district attorney’s office told the New York Times.

Records show he was jailed in both 2009 and 2011. He was on probation until 2014 for robbery, CBS New York said.

Neighbours were devastated when they heard the news. ‘It broke my heart in pieces, a little boy suffering like that,’ neighbour Ivan Sanchez told the Post.

‘He’s evil,’ Mr Sanchez added. ‘I hope he gets what he deserves.’
