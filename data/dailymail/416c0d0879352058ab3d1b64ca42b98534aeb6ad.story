A Russian air hostess who posted a picture of herself giving her passengers the finger has been given her job back.

Flight attendant Tatiana Kozlenko was initially sacked by Aeroflot airline bosses after the photograph ended up on Twitter.

The Russian state airline had a change of heart following worldwide sympathy for the 25-year-old flight attendant who was adamant the offending picture did not show her making the rude gesture.

Ms Kozlenko posted the picture on her personal page on Vkontakte, one of Russia's most popular Facebook-style social networks and within hours the snap had clocked up dozens of 'likes'.

The image then spread to international social network Twitter where it was re-tweeted by hundreds of users.

As a result, Aeroflot airline bosses soon found out about the photo and fired Ms Kozlenko.

Aeroflot - which announced the sacking on its own Twitter account - said: 'Posting this photo shows Tatiana’s attitude towards passengers and her duties. She acknowledged her fault when she spoke to her managers.'

Ms Kozlenko herself turned yet again to 
the social network to defend herself and display her upset at her 
sacking. She admitted that she tagged herself in the photo, which does 
not show anyone's face - but claims it isn't her.

'I
don’t consider myself guilty! The photo was added to my page, I only 
tagged myself on it!!! The hand isn’t mine, the plane is not my 
company’s!!! I don’t understand what they spoil my life for!!! I’m 
asking you for help and support,' she said on her Vkontakte page.

After support for her cause came 
flooding in, Aeroflot had a change of heart and has now allowed her to 
fly again, albeit on a six-month probation period.

‘General Director Vitaly Savelyev has
decided to take the girl back to Aeroflot. Hopefully, passengers will 
accept it with understanding,’ said Aeroflot spokesman Andrei Sogrin 
adding that ‘the girl was desperate to come back to work.

‘She was able to prove her sincerity 
and professional viability. Of course she pleaded guilty, and understood
that such things are not allowed.’

Ms Kozlenko, who claim it was neither her nor Aeroflot in the photograph, will be working under supervision and has deleted her Vkontakte account.
