This is the terrifying moment police shot dead a man in California after he brandished a pair of gardening shears.

The incident on a street corner in the city of Salinas in broad daylight, was witnessed by passers-by, with one filming the stand-off and posting the video to Youtube.

It is thought that police were called to the street following reports that a man was trying to break into a local resident's home and was threatening to kill them.

Officers were sent to the scene after the resident complained the man, who they say was armed with scissors, tried to kill their dog and exposed his genitals, while make inappropriate comments.

Despite the officers telling the man to stop and get down on the ground, he continues to walk away and at one point one officer tried to use his taser on the suspect but it was ineffective.

He then drew the shears from his backpack with police saying he swung them at the officers who were standing in close proximity and in danger of being stabbed or slashed.

The footage then shows the man being followed down the street by the two officers pointing their guns at him, while he swung the shears towards them.

The incident is the third this year in Salinas where police have shot and killed men they have been trying to apprehend, which has raised concern among people in the city.

But a police statement said: 'The Salinas Police Department is well aware of the concerns raised by the community in regards to this and other officer-involved shootings. We take the investigation of any act causing loss of life to be one of our most important responsibilities. 

'We ask the community to be patient and remain calm until enough facts are known so that a conclusion as to the appropriateness of the officers' actions can be determined.

'At this time evidence is being collected, video evidence is being evaluated, interviews are being conducted and a thorough investigation is underway.'
