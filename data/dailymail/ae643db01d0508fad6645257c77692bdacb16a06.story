Two terror suspects, one of whom is thought to be British, have reportedly been arrested by police in Kenya.

The pair were allegedly carrying hand grenades when they were detained in the beach resort of Diani on the country's south coast.

The Foreign Office said it is investigating, but has been unable to confirm the reports.

Two British citizens have reportedly been arrested in by anti-terror police in the Kenyan beach resort of Diani

It was initially reported that both suspects were British, but sources have since told Sky News they believe one of those arrested was from the UK.

The sources have also suggested the pair may have been carrying hand grenades.

A spokesman for the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office said: 'We're looking into reports of two British 
nationals detained in Kenya. We stand ready to offer consular 
assistance.'

Reports of the arrests come two months after gunmen 
stormed the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, killing 67 people 
including six Britons, and injuring more than 170.

Earlier this month, four men appeared in a
Nairobi court charged with 'supporting a terrorist group' in connection
with the attack in September.

Terror police are hunting the fugitive
'White Widow' of a 7/7 London bomber who is said to have masterminded 
the siege and is known to have links to the country.

Interpol issued a 'Red Notice' warrant 
for her arrest shortly after the attacks for terrorist offences in 
Mombasa dating back to 2011.

British-born Samantha Lewthwaite is also wanted in connection with seven murders in Kenya.

Kenyan
security officials have described her as an 'incredible threat' and 
said they are working 'around the clock' to bring her in.

Seven
of Lewthwaite's Â­disciples, including a Tanzanian preacher, a Somali 
national, a Ugandan and three Kenyans, are also being hunted.

There are currently thought to be around 200,000 British nationals living in or visiting Kenya.
