'Unjustifiable': Pressure is mounting on George Entwistle to hand back some of his £450,000 pay-off

Failed director general George Entwistle's 'obscene' £450,000 pay-off was signed off by a BBC Trust boss as she watched Strictly Come Dancing, it has been revealed.

Lord Patten telephoned his deputy Diana Coyle during the hit show on Saturday evening and they agreed that Entwistle should get double what he was entitled to if he did the 'honourable' thing and quit.

After the £1.3m deal was done, which also included a £877,000 pension pot, Ms Coyle went back to watching dancers like Denise Van Outen, Fern Britton, Kimberley Walsh, Michael Vaughan and Louis Smith, the BBC Trust confirmed to MailOnline.

Entwistle's pay deal has caused huge controversy and the admission the offer was sealed in this way could cause more damage to the BBC.

'Diane Coyle was consulted on Saturday evening as a member of the Remuneration Committee.  During the broadcast of Strictly Come 
Dancing she took a call from the Chairman for this and then returned to 
watching television afterwards,' a BBC Trust spokesperson said.

'There was not a formal meeting of the Remuneration Committee but each member of the Committee was consulted.'

Ms Coyle is married to BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones and was economics editor for The Independent for eight years.

Meanwhile the BBC was locked in an extraordinary standoff with Parliament and Downing Street last night over the ‘unacceptable’ £450,000 double pay-off to the former director general.

MPs on all sides voiced outrage over a ‘reward for failure’ as it emerged Mr Entwistle had been paid double the cash he was entitled to in order to ‘conclude matters quickly’.

Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman urged Mr Entwistle to give up half his pay-off – £225,000 – saying it was impossible to justify.

Deal: BBC Trust vice chairman Diana Coyle was called by her boss Lord Patten during Strictly - they agreed on Entwistle's deal and then she went back to watching the show

Strictly business: Fern Britton stunned the judges with her routine on Saturday - an episode watched by Diana Coyle as she helped agree George Entwistle's pay deal

Strictly one payoff: Diane Coyle, Lord Patten's deputy, sent this Twitter picture as she prepared to watch reality show Strictly Come Dancing and sign off former director general George Entwistle's £450,000 pay off

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also said it was difficult to justify, saying today: 'Mr Entwistle was offered this money, he did not need to take it.'

He told ITV's Daybreak that it was 'up to the BBC to justify, as Lord Patten sought to, why they took the decision'.

Mr Entwistle resigned on Saturday night, saying he was doing the ‘honourable’ thing by taking responsibility for Newsnight’s disastrous investigation into child abuse.

Royal Opera House chief executive Tony Hall is said to be the early favourite to replace George Entwistle as the next director general.

Hall joined the BBC as a trainee after graduating from Oxford and helped launch BBC Parliament, Radio 5 Live and by 34 was editing the 9 O'Clock News.

He then went on to hold several senior executive roles before going to the Royal Opera House in 2001 - two years after a failed application to be director general.

He did not apply last time but an insider said he is 'respected inside and outside the BBC' and could be ideal to steady the ship.

His pay-off came after just 54 days in the job, making it worth more than £8,000 for every day he served.

He also leaves with an £877,000 pension pot.

But Culture Secretary Maria Miller told MPs it was ‘not right’ for Mr Entwistle to be handed such a massive pay-off and urged him to ‘consider whether it is appropriate for him to accept those payments’.

Mrs Miller, who invited the National 
Audit Office to investigate the deal said it was a ‘reward for failure’,
adding: ‘The circumstances of his departure make it hard to justify the
level of severance money agreed.’

Ministers
say they are powerless to block the payment but hope to shame Mr 
Entwistle into giving up part of it, as they did with the vast pension 
owed to Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin.

A Downing Street source said the 
payment was ‘hard to justify’, adding that it was now ‘a matter for 
George Entwistle’s conscience’.

Earlier,
the BBC chairman Lord Patten claimed the decision to hand Mr Entwistle a
pay-off worth a year’s salary was necessary to ensure his swift 
resignation and co-operation with a series of internal inquiries.

Mr Entwistle’s contract entitled him 
to only six months’ severance pay if he resigned. But Lord Patten 
suggested that Mr Entwistle would have been sacked if he had refused to 
quit – in which case he would have been entitled to a 12-month pay-off.

Lord
Patten’s explanation irritated Downing Street and led to fresh calls in
Parliament for his resignation. In other developments:

■
An official report by Ken MacQuarrie into the disastrous Newsnight 
investigation said the programme failed to complete ‘basic journalistic 
checks’,

■ The BBC’s director of news, Helen Boaden, and her deputy, Stephen Mitchell, ‘stepped aside’,

■
Boris Johnson called on Lord Patten to apologise ‘on his knees’ to Lord
McAlpine, the former Tory Treasurer smeared by Newsnight,

■
The Corporation’s new acting director-general Tim Davie, a former Pepsi
marketing man turned up tieless on the second day of the job –but 
pledged to ‘get a grip’ of the crisis. He refused to be drawn on Mr 
Entwistle’s pay-off,

■ Iain
Overton, head of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which helped 
Newsnight produce the child abuse report, resigned from his post,

■
Labour’s deputy chairman Tom Watson was urged to apologise for using 
Parliamentary privilege to make separate claims that a senior Tory was 
involved in child abuse.

Humiliation: George Entwistle, flanked by BBC chairman Chris Patten, announces his resignation to the media over the 'unacceptable' Newsnight broadcast which wrongly implicated a senior former Conservative in a child abuse scandal

During an emergency debate in the Commons four MPs called for Lord Patten to go.

Philip Davies, a Tory member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee said the former Conservative Party chairman had been ‘asleep at the wheel’.

Labour MP John Mann said Lord Patten should be sacked to allow the BBC to ‘move on’.

Tory MPs Peter Bone and Philip Hollobone also called for him to go.  

Mrs Miller, who is privately dismayed by Lord Patten’s slow response to the crisis, suggested his job was safe for now, saying it was ‘in the long term interests of the BBC to have a period of stability’. She said Lord Patten had ‘a key role in ensuring this crisis is handled successfully’.

Tory MPs David Nuttall and Justin Tomlinson said the crisis of trust raised questions about the future of the licence fee.

Mr Nuttall said: ‘This latest debacle will bring forward the day when the British people will have the freedom to decide for themselves whether to pay for the BBC.’

Other MPs insisted the crisis must not be used as an excuse to dismantle a much-loved institution.

Senior Tories claimed an anti-Conservative bias within the BBC helped explain the haste with which Newsnight attempted to ‘smear’ members of the Thatcher government without proper checks.

MP Conor Burns described the Newsnight investigation as a ‘vengeful and spiteful’ attack on Lady Thatcher and her legacy.

Boris Johnson called for everyone involved in the broadcast to be sacked immediately. He said the false claim that a senior aide to Lady Thatcher had been involved in child abuse was ‘like a dream come true for any vaguely resentful and left-of-centre BBC producer’.
