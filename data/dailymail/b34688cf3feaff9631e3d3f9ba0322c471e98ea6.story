Audacious: Reece Scobie (pictured) duped leading travel companies to pay for a six-month globe-trotting spree

It was a lavish con worthy of actor Leonardo DiCaprio’s character in hit movie Catch Me If You Can.

Teenager Reece Scobie repeatedly jetted around the world, flying business class and staying in luxury hotels, after duping his travel agent bosses.

And, as with DiCaprio’s film character Frank Abagnale jr, who posed as an airline pilot to travel the world, the 19-year-old proved adept at living on his wits.

Scobie spent more than £70,000 on a jetset lifestyle by conning his former travel agent bosses, a rival travel company, and even Scottish court officials.

He booked business-class flights to destinations around the world, including Singapore and Los Angeles, during a six-month spending spree.

The teenage conman, who lives with his mother in Rait, Perthshire, also booked round-the-world trips taking in Dubai, Auckland, New York and Vancouver.

While he was being investigated, Scobie even managed to dupe court staff into handing back his passport which had been confiscated as a condition of bail.

The teenager only worked for Thomson Travel for two months but continued to use the company’s passwords to book flights and hotels after leaving his job.

Perth Sheriff Court heard that Scobie has, according to his lawyer, been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome.

Dubai: Scobie used both his own name and a series of aliases to book the rooms at locations including Dubai

The hearing was told that he used both his own name and a series of aliases to book the rooms. He treated two of his friends to a night in a luxury hotel.

On one occasion, he was in a British Airways airport lounge and spotted that the previous user of a computer there, who worked for Cambridge Business Travel, had not properly logged off.

Scobie was able to gain access to the 
company’s booking system and used it to arrange flights to LA, New York,
Atlanta, Abu Dhabi and Singapore.

It was while Scobie was in Los Angeles that irregularities came to light and his return flight was cancelled, forcing him to borrow cash to pay for a flight home.

Scobie admitted two charges of fraud by obtaining services, flights and accommodation while employed at Thomson Travel in Perth.

He
also admitted that between July 2011 and January 2012 he booked an 
unspecified number of flights and hotel rooms on the company’s account 
using company passwords.

He also admitted accessing the accounts of Cambridge Business Travel and booking numerous flights in January last year.

The court was told that Thomson Travel had been conned out of £11,256, while Cambridge Travel was duped out of £59,878.

Scobie made some of the bookings from the public computer in Perth’s AK Bell Library.

He was arrested early in 2013 and had his passport taken by Perth Sheriff Court as a bail condition.

However, he returned to court on April 18 and falsely said he had a new job in the travel industry and would need his passport.

The passport was returned after he produced a series of faked documents relating to his ‘new’ post.

Vancouver: The teenager also visited Vancouver while on his travels

Yesterday, defence solicitor Jim Laverty said his client knew he was at serious risk of being sent to prison because of the sheer scale of the fraud.

Mr Laverty added: ‘I fully accept on his behalf that unless I can convince your Lordship that there is a credible and realistic alternative then you must detain him.’

He told the court his client had been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. Sentence was deferred for psychiatric and restriction of liberty order reports.
