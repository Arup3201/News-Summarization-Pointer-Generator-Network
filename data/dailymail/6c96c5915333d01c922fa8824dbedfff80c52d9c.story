In the battle of the broadcasters, Sky has announced plans to launch its own mobile network, powered by O2. 

O2's owner Telefónica UK  will give Sky wholesale access to 2G, 3G and 4G voice and data services, with the first deals expecting to launch in 2016.

Sky is hoping to rival fellow broadcaster Virgin Media, which uses EE's network for its mobile services, and BT, which is said to be in talks to buy EE.

O2's owner Telefónica UK will give  Sky wholesale access to 2G, 3G and 4G voice and data services. The first deals are expected to launch in 2016. Sky is the country's second-largest provider of home broadband and is the most popular 'triple-play' provider, with 40% of customers taking its TV, telephone and broadband

Additionally, Three is  poised to buy O2.

Under the terms of Sky's multi-year deal, Telefónica UK will share its network with the media giant across the UK, and the first services will launch next year.

Jeremy Darroch, Group Chief Executive, Sky said: 'Sky has a proven ability to launch new services, at scale. 

'Through our partnership with Telefónica UK, we can build on our expertise to launch a range of exciting new services and exploit the opportunities for growth in the fast-changing mobile sector.' 

Sky is the country's second-largest
provider of home broadband since entering the market seven years
ago, with more than 5 million customers. 

Under the terms of Sky's multi-year deal, Telefónica UK will share its network, and the first services will launch next year.

Meanwhile, Telefónica UK already rents part of its network to Tesco Mobile.

Sky is hoping to rival fellow broadcaster Virgin Media, which shares EE's network, and BT, which is said to be in talks to buy EE. 

Additionally, Three's owner Hutchison Whampoa is said to be poised to buy Telefónica.

Vodafone was initially seen as a leading contender for the wholesale
partnership with Sky as the two firms already have content partnerships
in place. 

Vodafone Red 4G customers can get access to Sky Sports as part of their plan, for example.

Instead, Vodafone is planning to launch a broadband and TV service later this year that will use its Cable and Wireless business fibre network, and BT's Openreach network. 

It is also said to be the most popular 'triple-play' provider, with almost 40 per cent of its customers taking its three services - TV, telephone and broadband. 

Adding a mobile service would make it a so-called 'quad-play provider.'  

More recently, it launched a mobile TV service Sky Go that lets people watch live and on-demand  films and TV shows on their phones and tablets.

Financial terms of the partnership were not given and an O2 spokesman said the deal would not affect existing O2 customers.

Meanwhile, Telefónica UK already rents part of its network to Tesco Mobile and showing its willingness to open its network to Sky could help it gain regulatory approval for its acquisition by Three.

If this acquisition is approved, it will create the country's largest mobile network.

Ewan Taylor-Gibson, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'Sky is keeping up with the Joneses - Virgin Media, TalkTalk and potentially BT later this year - to become the latest telecoms giant to offer all four services.

'Quad play is proving all the rage amongst telecoms providers, but mobile often seems like the afterthought of these four-way bundles.

'Many customers are already tied into long contracts so aren't in the market for a new mobile deal.

'The advantage is that all your services are under one roof, making billing far simpler, but if one service isn't up to scratch, it can be harder to leave.  

Meanwhile, the biggest fixed-line provider, BT, is in
talks to buy EE  as companies increasingly
seek to offer a package of services including fixed and mobile
calls, broadband and entertainment.

The new tie-up could be bad news for Vodafone, though, continued Mr Taylor-Gibson.

Jeremy Darroch, group chief executive at Sky said: 'Sky has a proven ability to launch new services, at scale. Through our partnership with Telefónica UK, we can build on our expertise to launch a range of exciting new services.' Following the news, Sky shares dipped by one pence to just below 936.7p

'With Sky piggybacking off O2's network, which also provides services to Tesco Mobile, the tie-up could be bad news for Vodafone, which had been seen as a leading contender for a wholesale partnership with Sky,' he said.

Sky and Vodafone already have a number of content partnerships
in place.

Vodafone Red 4G customers can get access to Sky Sports as part of their plan, for example.

Vodafone is planning to launch a broadband and TV service later this year that will use its Cable and Wireless business fibre network, and BT's Openreach network. 

Pricing details, and what TV content will be offered, has yet to be announced. 

Commenting on the Sky and Telefonica UK partnership, Paolo Pescatore, director of apps and media at CCS Insight said: 'Sky was forced down this route. It can't afford to be left behind in the multi-play market.

'With BT's plans to launch a consumer mobile offering and the acquisition of EE as well as Vodafone's plans to offer broadband and TV, Sky had no choice but to launch its own mobile offer.'

Dominic Baliszewski, telecoms expert at broadbandchoices added: 'This is further proof of the UK’s inevitable shift towards ‘Quad-Play’ services, but it remains to be seen how quickly customers will adopt these new bundles.

'At the moment, just understanding the new mobile world order is going to be confusing enough for customers with Sky teaming up with Telefonica, Telefonica selling O2 to Three and BT buying EE outright. 

'When the dust settles and packages become available it is important that customers are given clear information to help them understand how these deals are structured, priced and delivered if they are to avoid signing up to something that they don’t really need.'
