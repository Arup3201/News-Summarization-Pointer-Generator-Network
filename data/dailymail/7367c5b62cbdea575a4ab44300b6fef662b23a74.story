The swashbuckling drama Poldark launched last night on BBC to rave reviews by critics.

What captured the attention of viewers was not only the tousle-haired Captain Ross Poldark, played by Aiden Turner, but the rugged Cornwall which served as a backdrop to the action. 

Tourism bosses are predicting a stampede of the show's fans to be booking West Country hotels, guest houses and campsites, to experience the spectacular scenery.

The drama is set in 18th century Cornwall, with filming locations Gunwalloe, Charlestown and Porthgwarra taking the spotlight. Pictured here is the coast near Gunwalloe Fishing Cove

Porthgwarro, near Land's End, served as a backdrop to the passionate mining drama, which is set for an eight week run on BBC One

Holidaymakers are set to flock to filming locations such as Gunwalloe, Charlestown and Porthgwarra, which take their turn in the spotlight in the 18th century family drama.

Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall for Cornwall Development Company said that if Downton Abbey can put Highclere Castle on the map, the West Country can expect similar hoards of crowds.

The adaptation of Winston Graham's book debuted last night on BBC One, and tells the story of Captain Ross Poldark, who has returned from war in America to find his father has died, his tin mines are in disarray and his house is a wreck.

A passionate plot weaves around the 18th century mining history of the area, and Visit Cornwall is predicting tourists will be lining up to see the sights of the county where it is set.

Mr Bell said: 'Prime-time coverage such as this can have substantial impact on a destination.

'If the initial reviews are anything to go by, Poldark looks set to be a massive hit, and with 12 novels in the Poldark series there is potential for it to run and run.

'The opportunity is there to be seized and I look forward to working with the tourism industry to turn the success of the production into a success for Cornwall.'

Charlestown was one of the filming locations for the family drama. It is estimated a production of the scale of Poldark can bring in £32,000 per day in the region through hotel stays for the team, food, transport and hiring local crew

The drama was filmed at various locations across Cornwall from Charlestown to Porthgwarra last summer and the series put the spotlight on the county's breath-taking landscapes 

The tourism service is preparing to maximise on exposure from the eight week series by creating Poldark-themed holiday ideas and competitions.

Kaye Elliot, head of production services at Creative England agrees, saying: 'Filming can bring a huge amount of money into a region.

'When a production like Poldark comes to town, they can spend up to £32,000 per day in the region, on things like hotels, food, transport and hiring local crew.

'Over the last year, filming has brought £11 million of inward investment from on location spend into the South West - and that's before you consider the impact of tourists visiting their favourite film locations.'

Poldark hires the fiery Demelza to help out at his Nampara estate, kickstarting one of the most popular love triangles of modern fiction

Cornwall councillor Julian German, portfolio holder for economy and culture, said: 'Through Poldark, Cornwall has been offered a valuable showcase.

'With the series running until the end of April, the profile boost will coincide with the Easter break and when people are starting to make bookings. 

'It is hoped that the stunning scenery will inspire viewers to visit for themselves and discover the mining heritage which plays a central role throughout the story.'

The original adaptation of the  book series by Winston Graham was a huge success with the series being broadcast in more than 40 countries. If this is anything to go by, the remake is set to bring flocks of holidaymakers to its Cornish backdrop
