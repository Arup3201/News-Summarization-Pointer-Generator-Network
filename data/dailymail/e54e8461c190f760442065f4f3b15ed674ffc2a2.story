Having fertility treatment can be very stressful for hopeful parents, but now one clinic has found a way of making it slightly easier.

A fertility clinic in Barcelona has created an app that allows parents-to-be to see their embryos in the lab in real-time.

The Institut Marquès fertility clinic offers the service to couples who are having IVF and whose embryos are being incubated in an ‘Embryoscope’.

This state-of-the-art incubator contains
 a camera which takes a photograph of the embryo every 20 minutes for 
the three to five days that it is being incubated after fertilisation, 
and before it is transferred to the mother-to-be.

These images can then be accessed be the parents via an app – known as ‘Embryomobile’ - on their smartphones.

Dr Victoria Walker, fertility specialist at Institut Marquès fertility clinic, told MailOnline: ‘This app helps parents-to-be feel close to their embryos and it makes them feel empowered.

‘It allows them to feel more in touch with the embryo.’

She added: ‘We have had very positive feedback. During trials 100 per cent of people said seeing the images was very powerful and 87 per cent said it was a powerfully positive experience.

‘People also say it makes them feel calmer and they say it is amazing to see the creation of new life.

The images are taken by a camera in the incubator every 20 minutes. They are also used by the embryologists to track which are likely to be the best quality for transfer to the mother

‘They are amazed to be able to see their children being created and they say it makes them feel part of the process.’

Dr Walker said the images are also beneficial for the embryologists as seeing how the embryo changes can allow them to detect which are of good quality and which are not.

This allows them to select the strongest embryos for transfer to the woman, giving the best chance of a successful pregnancy.

Dr Walker said: ‘Most people are extremely impressed by the images – parents are watching the beginning of their child’s life. It is very moving.’

She compared the experience to the first antenatal scan and said the average couple look at the images three or four times a day.

One hopeful parent said: ‘It's 
definitively incredible. It's an awesome view of the origin of a human 
life. I've studied biology and my husband and me feel really rewarded 
and full of joy for being the witnesses of such an amazing event.’

Another added: ‘I have seen the creation of life and it is something very special when you know they are yours.’

Only hopeful parents who pay an extra 500 euros to have the special incubator are able to use the app.

If the embryo is successfully transferred to the woman, and the pregnancy is successful, the parents receive a DVD showing a slideshow of the images.

The fertility clinic has also established that there is a greater chance of fertilisation if eggs in the lab are played music. Freddie (pictured) was the first British baby to be born thanks to the technique

The Institut Marquès fertility clinic hit the headlines last year for using a technique which sees music played to embryos while they were in a petri dish.

The first British baby born thanks to the technique was born in 2012.

Freddie was played pop songs by Michael Jackson and Madonna as well as tracks from Nirvana and Metallica while in the dish.

Researchers believe the vibrations caused by the music aid fertilisation.

The scientists found that the chance of fertilisation during IVF treatment is five per cent higher if music is played in the incubators.
