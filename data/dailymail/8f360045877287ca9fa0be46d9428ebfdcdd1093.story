The ex-wife of former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman was yesterday arrested and charged with being drunk in public.

Rhonda Aikman, 43, who last year divorced the three-time Super Bowl winner after a ten-year marriage, was released from jail the same day on a $269 bond.

She was taken to Collin County Jail after appearing to be drunk near Plano, Texas, and her car was towed to a pound, according to TMZ.

The mother-of-three was charged with public intoxication, but police have not revealed any more details about her arrest.

It comes 16 months after Mrs Aikman, who is a cast member of the upcoming Bravo TV reality show The Real Housewives of Dallas, quietly divorced her 45-year-old husband.

Following an agreement last April the former Dallas Cowboys publicist was paid a $1.75million chunk of Mr Aikman’s $25million fortune he accrued after his football career ended in 2001.

They announced they were separating in January last year but did not reveal what was behind their decision, saying only that they ‘remain deeply committed to our children’

They reportedly began dividing their property between them months before they officially split.

The couple had wed in 2001, months after Mr Aikman retired from his highly successful 12-year career with the Cowboys.

Mrs Aikman, who had one child from a previous marriage, had two daughters with Mr Aikman – Jordan, 11, and ten-year-old Alexa.

Mr Aikman, who works as a TV commentator for Fox Sports and also co-owns the San Diego Padres baseball team, is considered by many experts as one of the finest quarterbacks of all time.

Despite being a promising ball player during his teenage years in West Covina, California, he rejected an offer to sign for the New York Mets.

Instead he joined the University of Oklahoma’s football squad in 1984 and embarked on a journey that would later see him being inducted into both the college and NFL halls of fame.

However, his first season ended badly when he broke his ankle during a game.

After sitting out most of the National Championship-winning 1985 season, he transferred to UCLA.

He led the Bruins to the 1987 Aloha Bowl, won the Davey O’Brien Award as the nation’s top college quarterback in 1988 and helped his side achieve a 17-3 victory over the Arkansas Razorbacks in the 1989 Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas.

After the game, the Cowboys snapped him up as the Number 1 NFL draft for the 1989 season.

In the 1992 playoffs, he broke Joe Montana's passing record to help Dallas first get into and then win the team’s first Super Bowl since 1977.

He helped the Cowboys win the NFL championship again in 1993 and 1995.

His career ended after suffering a string of injuries, including ten concussions.
