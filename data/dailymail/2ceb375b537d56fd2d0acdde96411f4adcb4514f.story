Victoria is set to introduce 'no jab, no play' legislation to ban unvaccinated children from attending childcare centres.

The policy was successfully introduced in New South Wales in 2014 and Victoria's participation signals a progression in the nationwide effort to crack down on parents that reject vaccination.

The state government have begun preparations and the legislation could potentially be finalised by as soon as early 2016, according to Health Minister Jill Hennessy.

Victoria will introduce 'no jab, no play' laws to ban unvaccinated children from enrolling at childcare centres

The legislation was introduced in New South Wales in 2014 and are expected to be in place in Victoria by as early as 2016

The government is passionate about these laws, with Ms Hennessy taking the tough stance in the hope parents understand that failing to vaccinate a child is 'unsafe' for both the child and any children they come in contact with, according to The Australian.

According to the laws, preschools and day care centres have the right to prohibit children from attending if they have not been vaccinated.

Parents who are conscientious objectors can only enrol their child if they have permission from a medical practitioner, who has given the parents counselling and made the parents aware of the inherent risk of failing to vaccinate their child.

Children who are proven to be unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons are also exempt from the 'no jab, no play' laws.

It has also been announced that whooping cough vaccines will be made free to all Victorian expectant parents once again, the state government says.

Disease rates have jumped by more than 50 per cent in the last year with children under one the most affected by the increased rates.

Premier Daniel Andrews met with new parents at Melbourne's Royal Women's Hospital on Sunday to announce the program which will provide free vaccines for women in their third trimester and parents of babies up to six months old.

'Parents will get the free whooping cough shots to protect them from giving to their children, unknowingly, what can be a deadly virus,' he told reporters.

'This will save lives.'

A tender process will be carried out to source the vaccine, which is currently in a worldwide shortage.

Health Minister Jill Hennessy said more than 80,000 Victorians would be vaccinated under the program.

The program had previously been in place but was removed by the Liberal government in 2012.

It will cost the government $8.4 million over four years and will be paid for through the scrapping of the Building Code and Construction Code Compliance Unit.

Earlier this week, pro-vaccination campaigners took to social media to express their outrage over an anti-immunisation advocate's plans to come to Australian shores.

Sherri Tenpenny, who has written books such as Saying No to Vaccines and Flu and Flu Vaccines: What's Coming Through That Needle?, will be touring in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sydney in February and March.

The seminars are called Raising Healthy Children Naturally, and Birth, Baby and Beyond.

People will also get the chance to sit down and have dinner with the high-profile anti-vaccination campaigner, with tickets ranging from $125 to $200.

On her website, Dr Tenpenny writes she believes 'vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual' and is against 'a system that forces parents to inject their children, against their better judgment'.

Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site, which read: 'I didn't deny my children vaccines... I spared them' and 'Fact: 1 in 50 = Autism Overall, Fact: 1 in 25,000 = Unvaccinated, Prove Me Wrong'.

But Dr Tenpenny's visit have people so outraged they have vowed to write to local politicians to stop her from spreading her message, with Stop the AVN - a group who are for vaccines - leading the charge.  

The seminars are called Raising Healthy Children Naturally and Birth, Baby and Beyond, and will be held in Queensland, NSW, South Australia and Victoria

Stop the AVN's Dave Hawkes told Daily Mail Australia the group's concern was Dr Tenpenny 'peddled misinformation'.

'She's giving information that's not supported by evidence and marketing it to people with alternative views and possibly leaving them in danger by not vaccinating their young children,' he said.

Dr Hawkes - who has a PhD in HIV research - said it was also concerning that people who were joining Dr Tenpenny, like Isaac Goldman, were spruiking homeopathic vaccines, which are 'essentially water'.

'The evidence shows they don't work… and leaves their kids susceptible,' Dr Hawkes said.

'Recently a seven-month-old child who was not vaccinated died from whooping cough.'

One of Stop the AVN's supporters wrote on social media she was going to write to federal politicians asking for their intervention.

'I'm writing to the Hons Sussan Ley and Fiona Nash (health minister and assistant health minister). Vaccines are recommended by every state body in Australia. They are incentivised by our federal govt,' one woman said on Facebook. 

People have taken to social media to express their outrage, with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign

Some have even taken to the Facebook pages of venues slamming them for holding the events

While others have expressed their disgust on the social media pages of the venues holding the seminars.

'I am beyond disgusted that you are hosting an anti vaccination seminar in March... Children die each year in this country as a result of this misinformation, is the small amount of money you are going to get... worth it?' a Facebook user wrote on Melbourne's Bayview Eden page.

Another wrote: 'Cannot believe you are hosting an anti vaccine seminar in March, disgusting. Never staying here, ever.' 

This comes after the Federal Court ruled against Homeopathy Plus, finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective, and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines, News Corp reported. 

National Centre of Immunisaiton Research and Surveillance director Peter McIntyre told Daily Mail Australia Dr Tenpenny was tapping into people's 'fear factor'.

'When we've got no disease to see, it's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it's something we still don't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated. You can understand why people would believe that,' he said.

'But there are hundreds of studies that disprove that.'

Professor McIntyre added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases.

He said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with 'sterile water'.

'It's just laughable really,' Professor McIntyre said.
