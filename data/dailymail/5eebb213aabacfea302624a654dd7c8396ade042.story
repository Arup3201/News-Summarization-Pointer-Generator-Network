Argument: Sally Roberts arrives at the High Court in London for a hearing to decide whether her son Neon should have life-saving radiotherapy treatment

A 37-year-old who took her critically ill seven-year-old son into hiding today denied she was a 'bonkers mother' and said she 'only wanted the best for her son'.

Sally Roberts ran away with her son Neon from Devon to Sussex because she thought cancer treatment would 'fry his brain', she told the High Court in London.

She believes Neon is 'not a sick boy' and should only be given 'natural remedies' while he recovers from surgery on a brain tumour, because radiotherapy could 'damage his growth'.

Her lawyer today asked the judge for sympathy, insisting that Mrs Roberts's position was 'principled, reasonable and in the best interests of Neon [her son]'.

But doctors said it is 'clearly' in Neon's best 
interests to have radiotherapy and chemotherapy and today argued that 'the alternative is death'.

Mrs Roberts said, 'I very much apologise', as she gave evidence on the first day of the hearing to decide what treatment Neon should have.

She told the judge that whatever decision the court made, 'I would still like every day to be part of my son's life. I feel I must be part of his care . It is very important for me and my son. We are very close.'

She fled the house in Devon where she and Neon were staying on Monday and took him to Sussex to stop him having the life-saving radiotherapy.

Fearing for Neon's survival, a judge ordered a nationwide search and allowed the boy's identity to be released to the media to help track him down.

The schoolboy is currently staying with his father, Ben, while his mother argues over his treatment in court.

A lawyer representing health authorities treating Neon told the court the 'alternative is death'.

Mr Justice Bodey said Neon's illness was the 'stuff of every parent's nightmare' and added that he would have to balance what treatment would achieve against the 'downsides'.

But doctors told that court that without it, the boy's medulloblastoma tumour may recur and he will die.

Mrs Roberts said her big fear was Neon being left with a lowered IQ after the treatment.

'I want him to have the best quality of life and I fear that radiotherapy could damage and greatly affect his future,' she told the judge.

'He has an incredible sense of humour. He is a great artist.

'He has been made out that he is sick and this is not true. He is very well. He is running around. He is not a sick boy.

A High Court judge made the extremely rare ruling that Neon could be named in an attempt to find him after Mr Roberts, 34, became concerned at having not heard from his wife and son in four days

'I feel that, if you go ahead with the radiotherapy, we are depriving him of his talents.

'He is thriving . He has done so well since being in hospital.'

A High Court appeal helped locate the pair in East Grinstead, West Sussex.

'I was forced into that situation,' Mrs Roberts told the court. 'That was the very worst thing I could possibly have done.

'I was given no choice. I thought if I brought him to the hospital they would not let me take him home and proceed with the treatment.'

Robin Tolson QC today told Mr Justice Bodey he hoped for 'much sympathy' for Mrs Roberts' position, and pointed to evidence of risks of significantly lowered IQs in those who undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as opposed to chemo alone.

'Such a significant loss of intellectual functioning is a real impairment to quality of life, particularly in the world Neon is likely to inhabit as an adult,' he said in court documents.

But NHS barrister Eleanor Grey QC argued that radiotherapy has been the norm for medulloblastoma patients since the 
1950s and before that 'all patients died'.

'Alternatives such as omitting 
radiotherapy and using chemotherapy only are associated with 
significantly poorer survival rates,' she told the court in written 
arguments.

'If a balancing exercise assessing the
proposed treatment is conducted, on the positive side of the scales is 
the fact that prompt treatment, involving radiotherapy and chemotherapy,
leads to a high chance of recovery.

'Since with no additional therapy medullablastoma will recur, the alternative is death.'

Mrs Roberts claimed last night in court that a doctor told her radiotherapy would ‘fry his brains’.

High Court judge Mrs Justice Hogg made
the extremely rare ruling that Neon could be named in an attempt to 
find him after his father Mr Roberts, 34, became concerned at having not heard from
his wife and son in four days.

Police and social workers took Neon from his mother shortly after 1.30am yesterday in East Grinstead.

He was temporarily placed into foster care and then given to his father, who is separated from Neon’s mother and lives in London.

But Mrs Roberts said she was out of contact because she was in Sussex taking Neon for treatment in an oxygen chamber and does not carry a mobile phone in case it affects his health.

Neon’s brain tumour was reportedly removed in full during surgery on October 25 – immediately after he was diagnosed with the aggressive medulloblastoma form of cancer.

Doctors then wanted to carry out the standard procedure of treating him with radiation to remove any further cancer cells and reduce the chances of the disease recurring.

However, Mrs Roberts, from Brighton, East Sussex, claims that when a doctor, he referred to the procedure as ‘frying his brains’.

‘I lost all confidence in him,’ she said. ‘It was frightening and very unprofessional. I thought, they have got the whole tumour out so why are they frying his brain?

‘I fear they are going to fry my son’s brain when there are other ways we could proceed. I feel it is very unnecessary and I’m sure any mother who had researched like I have would feel the same.

‘This is my only son. He’s my world. I need to be able to tell him I did everything I could for him.’

Sally Roberts says that she fears radiotherapy will permanently harm Neon's brain, affecting his IQ

Mrs Roberts, who is originally from New Zealand, added that she fears radiotherapy will permanently damage Neon's growth and future fertility. She wants to see if the tumour returns before resorting to radiation.

She said: ‘If I truly believed he had cancer now in his body I would agree to go ahead. But they are going after one cell that might be there. I am convinced it is not there because of the scans and because his spinal fluid is clear.

‘I don’t want to fry his brain and have his quality of life ruined just on the off chance there is a floating cell that is going to multiply.

‘All I’m doing is protecting my child. I’m doing what any mother would do.’

Neon has undergone a range of alternative therapies since his operation, including hours in an oxygen tank.

Mrs Roberts will not allow mobile phones near Neon in case they damage his health, feeding him a diet of organic foods and juices.

She is well-known in music circles and has performed as DJ Sally at venues ranging from Glastonbury Festival to Boujis Nightclub in London.

Her parents, Don and Lilian Leese, who live in North Tawton, Devon, said they support their daughter’s decision.

Doctors disagree with Mrs Roberts' decision to use only natural medicine and have started legal proceedings

Mrs Leese, 72, added: ‘Sally is the most caring, wonderful mother. She is totally dedicated to her children. Everything she is doing is what she believes is in Neon’s best interests.

‘She wants to work with [the doctors] but the medical profession want to do it all their way. One of the doctors scared the living daylights out of her, referring to it as “frying his brains”.

'That is something you don’t say to a mother whose child has just been diagnosed with a brain tumour.’

Mr Roberts, an IT consultant from Knightsbridge, west London, and the son of British actor Christian Roberts, described his estranged wife as a ‘concerned mother’, but added: ‘I want to make sure [Neon] has everything available to him. I understand there are lots of things that can be done to minimise the effects of radiotherapy.’

The hearing continues and the judge is expected to give his ruling tomorrow.
