A Polish man is facing jail after creating a fake booby-trap at his flat by tying disarmed hand grenades, bullets and an old alarm clock to pieces of string.

Bonifacy Wisniewski, 55, rigged the device to his front door to deter burglars at his apartment block in Zator.

A neighbour who knocked on his door to complain about loud music rang police after fearing his flat could be caught up in an explosion.

Bungler alarm: Bonifacy Wisniewski rigged his flat to make it look like a booby trap by tying disarmed hand greandes, bullets and an old alarm clock to pieces of string outside his door to deter burglars

Bogus: Bomb squad experts who examined the device said the alarm clock didn't even have batteries in it

Bomb squad experts who examined the device declared that although the grenades were real they had all been disarmed.

However, it was still illegal because they could technically be re-armed.

Likewise, the man was not licensed to own the ammunition that was also positioned around the flat.

Facing jail: Owning the hand grenades was still illegal even though they were disarmed because they could be re-activated and he was not licensed to have the ammunition

A police spokesman said: 'Even the clock did not have any batteries in it.

'It looks effective but would never have caused an explosion.

'Nevertheless it was completely illegal just to possess it and a report has been sent to prosecutors.'

In theory the man could end up with up to eight years in jail for illegal possession of the ammunition which was confiscated and destroyed.
