Â A man searching for prehistoric fossils in a river has found an entirely different type of treasure.

Dr Brian Tovin was swimming in South Carolina's Cooper River when he saw something shiny at the bottom. The water was so inky that a diving light provided only about 3 feet of visibility, The Post-Courier reports.

Instead of a shark tooth, Tovin was surprised to find a large class ring from the College of Charleston. The ring was inscribed with the initials RLP and the year 1974.

Tovin hunted down the ring's original owner by first calling the college's alumni association, CNN reports. The college confirmed that only two people graduated in 1974 with the initials 1974, including one female student. Tovin determined he was looking for Robert LeVaughn Phillips.

Phillips graduated from the College of Charleston with a degree in business administration. The ring was the last gift his mother gave him before she died from pancreatic cancer.

Tovin searched on social media to find Robert's son, Eric Phillips, CNN reports. When he contacted the younger Phillips, Tovin quizzed him to confirm the ring owner's identity. Phillips submitted an emailed copy of his father's college diploma as proof.

Tovin presented the ring to Phillips, who is now fighting cancer and recently underwent brain surgery. He presented Phillips with the ring in front of his family.

'I was down there fighting strong currents and alligators trying to get you your ring back,' he said.

Phillips lost the ring when it came loose when he got stuck on a pop top while opening a beer can, The Post-Courier reports. He had been boating on the Cooper River with his future wife Nancy.

'Thank you Lord that I got it back,' Phillips said to CNN. 'I had a nightmare the other night that I lost it again.

'No more beer cans.'
