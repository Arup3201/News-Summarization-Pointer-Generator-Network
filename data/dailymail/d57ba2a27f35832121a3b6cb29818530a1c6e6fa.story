Nurses wore too much protective clothing while treating Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, the CDC has claimed. 

The shocking accusation is the latest of many contradictions made by the center as it emerges medical chiefs are still not sure how to tackle the deadly virus.

Blaming staff at Texas Presbyterian Hospital for the latest outbreaks, CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden said removing multiple layers of gloves and overalls is so difficult that it increases the risk of contamination.

His words come hours before he faces a grilling alongside the operator of the Texan hospital on Capitol Hill as Congress desperately tries to determine why so many failings have occurred.

Too much? The CDC now claims Texan nurses should have worn less protective clothing to avoid infection

'These are good, dedicated people who worried about themselves and their families and they were trying to protect themselves better, but in fact by putting on more layers of gloves or other protective clothing, it becomes much harder to put them on, it becomes much harder to take them off. 

'And the risk of contamination during the process of taking these gloves off gets much higher. That's true for several different areas of the body,' Frieden said last night.

The allegation is expected to be rebuffed by Dr Daniel Varga, the operator of the Texan hospital in which two nurses contracted Ebola, when the pair appear together before Congress at noon today. 

Dr  Varga, chief clinical officer at Texas Health Resources, conceded that errors were made by Presbyterian hospital in Dallas, which sent Thomas Eric Duncan home after he complained of a fever and abdominal pain when he arrived from his native Liberia last month.

'Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr Duncan, despite our best intentions and highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes,' Varga will tell the US Congress. 'We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry'.

Duncan died on October 8, a week after he became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US, and two weeks since he first sought treatment at the hospital's A&E department. 

Texas Health initially explained its failure to diagnose Duncan, who did not have health insurance, by saying a nurse had not shared the patient's travel records with a doctor. However, it has subsequently retracted this statement. 

Dr Varga wrote in his testimony: 'In our effort to communicate to the public quickly and transparently, we inadvertently provided some information that was inaccurate and had to be corrected.' 

He conceded that this had been 'unsettling to a community that was already concerned and confused'.

Two nurses involved in his care – Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29 – have since been diagnosed with the virus, raising serious questions about the hospital's procedures. 

Dr Varga said said he and his colleagues 'don't yet know precisely how or when' Pham was infected with Ebola as she was 'using full protective measures under CDC protocols'.

The National Nurses United union criticised Texas Health for Duncan's care after medical records suggested staff worked in the quarantine unit with their skin exposed during the three days between when the patient was admitted and when he was diagnosed. 

They alleged other failings in protective clothing and the isolation of Duncan. 

The 77 healthcare workers believed to have worked in the quarantine room with Duncan or handled samples of his blood are being monitored for symptoms. 

Dr Varga said in his testimony the staff had been separated into three categories based on how at-risk they were. 

Those at highest risk have been told to stay off work and not use public transport and were required to remain in the county where they live.  

In a statement on Wednesday, the CDC said: 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms that the second healthcare worker who tested positive last night for Ebola traveled by air October 13, the day before she reported symptoms.

'Because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning, CDC is reaching out to passengers who flew on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 Cleveland to Dallas/Fort Worth on October 13.

CDC is asking all 132 passengers on the Frontier Airlines flight (the flight route was Cleveland to Dallas Fort Worth and landed at 8.16pm CT) to call 1 800-CDC INFO (1 800 232-4636). After 1pm ET, public health professionals will begin interviewing passengers about the flight, answering their questions, and arranging follow up. Individuals who are determined to be at any potential risk will be actively monitored.

The healthcare worker exhibited no signs or symptoms of illness while on flight 1143, according to the crew. Frontier is working closely with CDC to identify and notify passengers who may have traveled on the flight.'

However, according to Flight-tracker, the plane was used for five additional flights on Tuesday before it was removed from service. 

Those flights include a return flight to Cleveland, Cleveland to Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport (FLL), FLL to Cleveland, Cleveland to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and ATL to Cleveland. 

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have also come under fire for their handling of the deadly virus.

CDC Director Thomas Frieden has admitted he should have sent a bigger team to Dallas after the initial diagnosis.

This was despite him making a prediction in August that major hospitals would be equipped to tackle the disease. 

The CDC have also faced criticism for allowing Ms Vinson, the second nurse to contract Ebola, to board a commercial flight despite her alarmingly high temperature. 

Ms Vinson had asked the CDC whether should could take a flight on October 13 to Ohio, where she was to spend time with her family. 

She had been told to proceed because her temperature of 99.5F (37.5C) fell below the CDC threshold of 100.4F.

CDC officials have since acknowledged that she should not have flown on a commercial plane. 

Dr Frieden said: 'Those who have exposures to Ebola, she should not have traveled on a commercial airline.

'The CDC guidance in this setting outlines the need for controlled movement. That can include a charter plane; that can include a car; but it does not include public transport. 

'We will from this moment forward ensure that no other individual who is being monitored for exposure undergoes travel in any way other than controlled movement.'

The CDC is now trying to contact every person that was on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 on Monday.

Ms Vinson reported to the hospital on Tuesday, the day after she landed, and was put in isolation within 90 minutes.

Dr Frieden has said his agency will 'double down' on disease surveillance and interventions to stop the spread of Ebola.

President Barack Obama has pledged to tackle Ebola in a 'much more aggressive way' 

His pledge was echoed by President Barack Obama, who has said his administration will target Ebola in a 'much more aggressive way'. 

He said: 'We're reviewing exactly how we're going to make sure that something like this is not repeated – and we are monitoring, supervising, overseeing in a much more aggressive way exactly what has taken place in Dallas initially, and making sure that the lessons learned are then transmitted to hospitals and clinics all across the country.'

The President also said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would launch a 'rapid response SWAT team' within 24 hours whenever a new case is confirmed.

Obama is struggling amid low approval ratings to show that he is in command of the world's most sophisticated public health infrastructure as Ebola threatens to claim tens of thousands of lives across the Atlantic Ocean.
