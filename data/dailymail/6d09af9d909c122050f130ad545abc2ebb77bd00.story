Winston Bogarde has applied for the vacant manager's job at Oldham Athletic.

The former Holland international, infamous for four bench-warming years at Chelsea, is one of 70 people who have registered their interest in becoming Lee Johnson's successor at Boundary Park.

Bogarde, 44, won a Champions League with Ajax in 1995 but it is the the centre-back's lucrative stint at Stamford Bridge for which he is most remembered in this country.

Winston Bogarde spent four unsuccessful years at Chelsea between 2000 and 2004

Picking up a reported £10m, he started just four games under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri and spent his final season commuting from Amsterdam, catching the early flight into Heathrow and training with the youth team at Harlington before his eventual retirement.

In 2011, Sportsmail revealed Bogarde was facing financial ruin after his £3.2m luxury home was repossessed.

Oldham say they are in no rush to appoint a new man after Johnson left to join League One rivals Barnsley despite being only five points outside the play-offs with a game in hand on most others.

They were hammered 4-0 at home by Preston North End on Saturday and head to Port Vale on Tuesday evening again under the guidance of caretaker boss Dean Holden and playing assistant Adam Lockwood.

Oldham have spoken to lifelong fan Paul Scholes about taking the role but admit any agreement with the United legend is unlikely.

Former boss Iain Dowie is a fans' favourite but whether the club could give him the funds he feels he needs to take them to the next level is doubtful.

Others in the frame include ex-West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Irvine, former player Shefki Kuqi and ex-Manchester City coaches Scott Sellars and Steve Eyre.
