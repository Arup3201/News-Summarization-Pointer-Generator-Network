Scientists at the centre of the furore surrounding the death of the world's oldest-recorded animal, have hit back at claims they killed the 507-year-old clam simply to find out how old it was.

The giant mollusc - nicknamed Ming because it was born at the time of the Chinese Ming Dynasty - met its demise at the hands of marine researchers, when they froze it to take back to their lab at Bangor University in 2006.

Last week the researchers announced the clam was more than 100 years older than their initial 2007 estimate of 405 years old - but ended up facing a storm of consternation as reports suggested they had killed the animal while trying to find out its age.

This is the only picture of Ming, believed to be the world's oldest animal at 507 years old. Not knowing the long life of the mollusc, researchers at Bangor University opened its shell for analysis, killing Ming in the process

By counting the number of rings visible on the outer shell of the mollusc, researchers calculated that Ming was an incredible 507 years old

Dr Paul Butler, a climate scientist from Bangor University, said Ming was one of many samples collected as part of a climate change research project that he was working on.

He said that researchers had no idea of the animal's age when they found it on the coast of Iceland in 2006, then dealt the fatal blow by putting it in a freezer before opening it.

Dr Butler said: 'This particular animal was one of about 200 that were collected live 
from the Icelandic shelf in 2006.'

A quahog’s shell grows a layer every summer when the water is warmer and food plentiful.

By counting the number of rings visible on the inside of Ming’s shell, scientists initially thought it was around 400 years old.

Ming's life came to an abrupt end seven years ago when scientists from Bangor University dredged the seabed near Iceland (pictured) as part of a study into climate change

However, after analysing the clam more closely, the experts now believe Ming, who was named after the dynasty thought to be ruling China at the time of its birth, was a century older.

‘We got it wrong the first time and maybe we were a bit hasty publishing our findings back then,’ Paul Butler, from Bangor University, told ScienceNordic.

The findings mean the mollusc was born seven years after Columbus  discovered America.

It lay on the ocean floor throughout historical milestones such as the English Civil War, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution and two world wars.

While the lifespans of different species may seem random, there is a pattern.

Generally, big creatures live longer than small ones and this goes for plants as well as animals.

At one end of the scale are mice and shrews, which live just a couple of years, while at the other are large animals like rhinos, hippos, giant tortoises, lions and elephants, which have life expectancies measured in decades - or even centuries.

Some Galapagos tortoises, for instance, have been recorded to reach nearly 200 years.

The bowhead whales have been found recently with antique harpoons embedded in their skulls dating from the 1790s.

Unless these were a freak, this means that in the sea today there may be large, intelligent animals that pre-date the invention of the railway engine.

Other Methuselahs include orange roughly, a Pacific fish increasingly popular as food.

These cold-water fish can live to more than 150 years old, meaning that your dinner could date back to a time when Queen Victoria was still middle-aged.

But there are some interesting anomalies. Humans, for instance, live longer than is to be expected for our size.

Marine biologist Doris Abele believes that Ming's ability to live for centuries could be down to the creatures slow metabolism.
