Fossils of three squirrel-like species from the time of the dinosaurs suggest mammals have been around on Earth for more than 200 million years.

The discovery in Liaoning Province, China, pushes back the date that mammals roamed the planet by around 40 million years, researchers claim.

The creatures, which are around the size of a mouse, also provide more clues about how the first mammals began diversifying.

The discovery of three new squirrel-like rodents from the time of the dinosaurs suggests that mammals have been around on Earth for more than 200 million years.

Scientists believe they later evolved into egg-laying monotremes such as the platypus, marsupials like the opossum, and placentals which include humans and whales.

The six well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called Haramiyida which until recently were only known from teeth.

'For decades scientists have been debating whether the extinct group, called Haramiyida, belongs within or outside of Mammalia,' said Dr Jin Meng, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

'Previously everything we knew about these animals was based on fragmented jaws and isolated teeth. But the new specimens we discovered are extremely well preserved.

'And based on these fossils we now have a good idea of what these animals really looked like which confirms they are indeed mammals.'

The six well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called Haramiyida. 

Haramiyidans represent one of the earliest known mammals and range from the Late Triassic to the Mid Jurassic.

Previously everything scientists knew about these animals was based on fragmented jaws and isolated teeth.

But the new specimens discovered are extremely well preserved. 

From their structure scientists have learned Euharamiyida, which were part of the Haramiyda were good climbers and probably spent more time in trees than squirrels.

The members of Euharamiyida likely ate insects, nuts, and fruit with their 'strange' teeth which have many cusps - or raised points - on the crowns. 

Despite the unusual teeth the overall physical characteristics seen in the new haramiyidan fossils is mammalian. 

The animals have been named Shenshou lui, Xianshou linglong, and Xianshou songae and lived about 160 million years ago during the Jurassic period.

The study, published in the journal Nature, suggests they evolved from a common ancestor during the Late Triassic around 208 million years ago.

They have placed in a new group - or clade - called Euharamiyida and probably looked similar to small squirrels.

They weighed between 1 and 10oz (28g and 280g) and had tails and feet suggesting they were tree dwellers.

'They were good climbers and probably spent more time than squirrels in trees,' said Dr Meng.

'Their hands and feet were adapted for holding branches - but not good for running on the ground.'

The members of Euharamiyida likely ate insects, nuts, and fruit with their 'strange' teeth which have many cusps - or raised points - on the crowns.

Mammals are believed to evolve from a common ancestor that had three cusps - human molars can have up to five.

But the newly discovered species had two parallel rows of cusps on each molar with up to seven cusps on each side.

How this complex tooth pattern evolved in relation to those of other mammals has puzzled scientists for decades.

But despite the unusual teeth the overall physical characteristics seen in the new haramiyidan fossils is mammalian.

For example the specimens show evidence of a typical mammalian middle ear - the area just inside the eardrum that turns vibrations in the air into ripples in the ear's fluids.

The middle ears of mammals are unique in that they have three bones - as evidenced in the new fossils.

Based on the age of the Euharamiyida, species the divergence of mammals from reptiles had to have happened much earlier than some research has estimated.

Instead of originating in the middle Jurassic between 176 and 161 million years ago mammals likely first appeared in the late Triassic between 235 and 201 million years ago - a finding corresponding with some studies using DNA data.

Dr Ming said: 'What we're showing here is very convincing that these animals are mammals and we need to turn back the clock for mammal divergence.

'But even more importantly these new fossils present a new suite of characters that might help us tell many more stories about ancient mammals.'

The fossils were found in the Tiaojishan Formation, Daxishan site of Linglongta in Liaoning Province, China
