Veteran presenter Bruce Forsyth's future on Strictly Come Dancing appears to be in doubt after a BBC executive hinted that his days on the show might be numbered.

The 86-year-old, who first appeared on Sunday Night At The London Palladium in 1958, is to have a meeting with BBC One Controller, Charlotte Moore, when he returns from his holiday in Puerto Rico, she said this weekend.

Moore said: 'He is not young and has missed a couple of programmes, so it is really important to have that conversation.'

Bruce Forsyth, 86, will have a 'conversation' about his future at Strictly, which he presents with Tess Daly

Asked if the BBC's most popular programme could cope without him, Moore added: 'Strictly is a phenomenon of British television and very robust.  But it isn't about one presenter.'

Before Christmas, the popular presenter admitted he was living 'on borrowed time' and said he struggled with the relentless schedules of filming Strictly.

'The constant week after week can drag you down, especially when you are getting older,' he said.

Forsyth said he had several work projects lined up for 2014, but added that that didn't necessarily include Strictly.

'I've got three one-man show dates fixed for next year and I'm doing another thing for TV in April that I can't talk about yet,' he said.

'So if I was to leave Strictly, I wouldn't retire.... While I'm able to walk and play golf, I'll still work.' 

The veteran presenter, seen here with Artem Chigvintsev and Natalie Gumede, first appeared on TV in 1958

Forsyth has presented the dance show since it launched in 2004, and has missed just two live shows because of sickness, once in 2009 and once last November.

Moore, who earns more than £240,000 a year in her BBC post, took on the job last summer, saying she wanted to shake the channel up and make it more diverse, to 'reflect the mix of a nation which itself has changed'.

She said she wanted a regular female presenter on Match Of The Day, and said she wanted to 'be brave and take risks' with her decisions for BBC One's output.
