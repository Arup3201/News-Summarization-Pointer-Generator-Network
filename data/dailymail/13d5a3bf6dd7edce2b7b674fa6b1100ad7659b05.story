Her aristocratic father-in-law chose to snub the marriage that officially made her part of his privileged - and eccentric - family.

But the new Viscountess Weymouth is making sure Lord Bath gets a good look at what he missed – by exhibiting the wedding snaps on the walls of his stately home.

Emma McQuiston, 27, has decorated Longleat House with her designer wedding dress and a large portrait of herself after she married Lord Bath’s son, Ceawlin Thynn.

His parents had refused to attend the event, and went to another wedding instead, after father and son fell out over the removal of murals from the walls of the historic country pile in Wiltshire.

Lady Emma, who has appeared in photo shoots for glossy magazines, later said of Lord Bath’s absence: ‘It’s very sad he didn’t come to the wedding and that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point, but what can I do?’

And in what many may see as an 
appropriate – if slightly cheeky – response, the new glamorous 
viscountess has installed an exhibition of her own.

It is part of a show organised Lady Emma - who will become Britain’s first black marchioness - called ‘Something Old and Something New’, examining the history of family weddings at the 9,500-acre estate, which is famous for its safari park.

Her Collarusso-made wedding dress has been put on display, along with a new portrait of the blushing bride painted by renowned artist Paul Benney.

The showcase includes portraits of her big day as well as diaries, photos, portraits and even newsreel footage of previous Thynn family weddings 

She explained: ‘The new exhibition is a lovely reminder of the wedding and it is a great way to showcase all the amazing work and effort others put in to make it such a memorable and joyous occasion.

‘It’s also fascinating to be able to compare it to other weddings which have taken place here at Longleat over the centuries.’

Argument: Ceawlin Thynn (right) was not on speaking terms with his parents after he removed murals his father Alexander Thynn (left), the seventh Marquess of Bath, had painted on the walls of the stately home

Lady Emma gained her title in June last year, when as plain Emma, the daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon, and an aspiring TV chef and food-blogger, she married Ceawlin Thynn, 40, whom she has known since she was four years old.

But the groom was not on speaking terms with his parents after he removed murals his father Alexander Thynn, the seventh Marquess of Bath, had painted on the walls of the stately home, when he moved into the property. 

Lord Bath, 82, failed to attend the wedding and instead attended the marriage of a family friend in Hampshire.

He is the seventh Marquess of Bath and is known for his Bohemian lifestyle and sex life which has famously involved a so-called ‘harem’ of scores of ‘wifelets’.

Lady Emma has previously spoken of racism in the British aristocratic circles in which he now mingles, telling Tatler magazine: ‘There has been some snobbishness, particularly among the much older generation. 

‘There’s class and then there’s the racial thing.’
