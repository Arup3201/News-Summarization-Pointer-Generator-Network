News Corp’s nine independent directors are worried about new U.S. legal trouble, reported the New York Daily News.

They are concerned in addition about Rupert Murdoch's stewardship of News Corp as the British scandal at the News of the World has grown.

News Corp has also hired Foreign Corrupt Practices Act specialist lawyer Mark Mendelsohn, reported the Wall Street Journal.

Experts say shareholders are concerned at Rupert and James Murdoch’s denial they knew anything about alleged phone hacking.

An investigation into whether News Corp employees hacked phones of 9/11 victims in the U.S. is already underway by the FBI.

The bribes the company allegedly paid to British police could also violate the corrupt practices act in the U.S, reported the New York Daily News.

Attorney General Eric Holder also confirmed the Justice Department is considering opening a formal investigation into the 9/11 hacking claims.

Meanwhile, New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg has asked the FBI to look further into a computer hacking case from 2009.

Allegations were made that a News Corp subsidiary hacked into the computers of a New Jersey rival to steal business secrets in 2004.

News America Marketing came to a $29million settlement with marketing firm Floorgraphics, reported the New York Daily News.

Rupert Murdoch also has former New York City school chancellor Joel Klein as an advisor to help him clear-up the phone-hacking mess.

He has been billed by the Daily Beast as 'Rupert Murdoch’s secret weapon in the battle to restore News Corp to its former glory'.

Mr Murdoch also has former Capitol Hill staffer Michael Regan who oversees the firm's political donations, reported the Washington Post.
