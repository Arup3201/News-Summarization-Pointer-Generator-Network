Minister for the Disabled Mark Harper has been labelled a 'hypocrite' after it emerged his own office isn't wheelchair friendly.

The Tory MP recently criticised businesses around the country for not making it easier for the disabled to get in and out.

But critics pointed out that the minister's own constituencyÂ office in Cinderford, Gloucestershire is on a steep hill with a large step from the pavement to the front door withno handrail.

Constituents have attacked Mark Harper, Minister for the Disabled, after it emerged he criticised 'inaccessible' shops and restaurants - despite his own constituency office being 'difficult to get into'

Local Labour councillor Max Coburn branded the MP was a 'hypocrite', adding: 'It's a bit rich criticising people when he doesn't do it himself.

'It's an awkward slope up to the door and you think he would have done something since he moved but he hasn't.'

Mr Harper, member of Parliament for the Forest of Dean, hit out earlier this month after a survey he commissioned discovered around a fifth of shops and a third of restaurants lack facilities to allow access for wheelchair users.

In response he said: 'This isn't just about doing what's right. Businesses are missing a trick by not doing more to tap into this market.

'Everyone deserves to be able to go Christmas shopping or enjoy a festive meal or drink with their friends or colleagues. Improving accessibility is a no-brainer.'

Mr Harper recently railed against shops with bad accessibility and insisted that improving it is a 'no-brainer'

Critics say the large step and lack of rail in front of his office's front door make it difficult to enter

He has now shrugged off criticism of his  office, claiming only a small number of constituents visit him in person and insisting he's willing to meet them elsewhere.

He said: 'Any constituent can use either the phone or email to reach my office.

'If anybody wishes to meet me to discuss an issue in person at a surgery then I hold these on a regular basis in accessible venues around the constituency.

'If a wheelchair user was to do so, then we do have a ramp available.'

His original comments came after a government audit of more than 30,000 shops and restaurants branded access for disabled people  'shocking'.

The report found only 15 per cent of restaurants and shops had hearing loops and three quarters of restaurants did not cater for those with visual impairments.
