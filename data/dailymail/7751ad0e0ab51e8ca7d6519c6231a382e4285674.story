A damning study by MPs has found that pupils are getting less than two hours of PE lessons a week.

The education select committee questioned more than 300 primary and secondary school teachers, less than half of whom claimed that school children have two hour of sports education each week.

Just 43 per cent said pupils enjoyed two hours of physical work a week, compared to 90 per cent in the academic year 2007 - 2008, when the sports survey was carried out under Labour's government.

Teachers' comments suggested that a full curriculum meant PE was often sacrificed in order to meet the criteria of the timetable

The figures suggests that since the Coalition came to power in 2010, the number of children having at least two hours worth of sport lessons has halved, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The Telegraph reported that teachers' comments suggested that a full curriculum meant PE was often sacrificed in order to meet the criteria of the timetable.

But the Department of Education said to compare with it the survey conducted in 2008 was 'ridiculous' because the earlier study spoke to more than 21,000 schools and asked different questions.

A spokesman said: 'It is ridiculous to compare a scientific research study of more than 21,000 schools to a self-selecting survey of just over 300, and each with completely different questions.'

The survey comes after comments made by Baroness Campbell, the head of the Youth Sport Trust, earlier this year.

The Coalition has emphasised it's commitment to reforming sport in schools to create a lasting Olympic legacy

She claimed that many children starting secondary school  were unable to throw a ball, catch, jump or run.

She
said that even pupils inspired to take up a sport after watching the 
Olympics missed out because teachers were not well trained enough to 
help them.

The Coalition has emphasised it's commitment to reforming sport in schools to create a lasting Olympic legacy.

In 2010 the Government said that far 
too few children were participating in regular competitive sport and 
that schools be given the freedom to organise more competitive sport.

Ministers want to encourage more competitive sport so it is a vibrant part of the ethos of all schools.

Earlier this month Lord Coe helped launch a new £150 million grant for school sports facilities. The investment comes as the Government unveils plans to train teachers to specialise in PE at primary school.

Lord Coe said: 'The problem in primary schools is that PE has become too much of a lottery. If you have a head teacher – male or female – who understands sport then probably you’ll have  a better chance of getting good provision.

'But if their experience of sport was not good then that tends to filter through the school. It occurred to me that the big gap in provision was in primary schools.'

However, in a direct contrast the Government's goal of creating more a more competitive atmosphere when it came to physical games, last week a group of MPs warned that such sports put some children off exercise for life and primary schools should be told to offer less taxing alternatives.

Safeguarding Britain’s Olympic legacy is about allowing as many children as possible to enjoy the health benefits of sport through non-competitive activities, they said in a report published on July 22.

The Commons Education Committee warned that competitive team sports have a ‘limited appeal’ to some children and politicians’ focus on them can be ‘counter-productive’.

But the committee of MPs urged the Department for Education to make clear to schools that there should also be non-competitive activities to increase the wellbeing of all children, and help control obesity.
