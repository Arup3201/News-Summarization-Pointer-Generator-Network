In the clear: Lindsay Lohan will not be prosecuted in her alleged September hit and run case

Lindsay Lohan's hit and run case has been dropped.

The actress will not be prosecuted 
over the alleged incident which happened outside a New York City hotel 
back in September, TMZ reports.

Lohan, 26, had been scheduled to 
appear in Manhattan court in New York on Tuesday over her September 19 arrest for leaving the 
scene of the accident, in which she allegedly drove a Porsche into a 
bystander at The Dream Hotel.

However after examining surveillance footage, prosecutors have determined there is not enough evidence to get a conviction.

The alleged victim, restaurant worker Jose Rodriguez, could still pursue 
civil charges - but Lindsay is said to be 'ecstatic' that the criminal 
case has now been dismissed, TMZ claims.

The news comes as Lohan's father is seeking a conservatorship for her.

Michael Lohan is convinced his 
daughter has resumed abusing drink and drugs and after trying to stage 
an intervention on Friday he is trying to go through the courts to get a
conservator appointed to look after Lindsay.

Michael claims his daughter is hanging out with the wrong people, including her mother, Dina Lohan.

He is not requesting he be made 
conservator - an appointed person who has legal control over the subject
- as he doesn't want to be in control of Lindsay's finances, so people 
can accuse him of going after her money.

According to website TMZ, Michael wants a judge to decide who to appoint conservator, but he says he will not accept Dina.

Michael has told his lawyer the first 
thing he plans once there is a conservatorship in place is to convince 
them to send Lindsay to rehab.

He claims every time Lindsay has been to rehab 'she went in dirty and didn't come out clean'.

He also blames the people around Lindsay for helping to fuel her addictions.

And he believes he, Dina and Lindsay need to go for family therapy, which his ex-wife has refused in the past.

However according to TMZ Lindsy has laughed off reports that he father wants to be made her conservator.

According to the website, the actress told a pal: 'No judge would buy it

'They would have a hard time 
believing the claims of someone who was investigated for insider 
trading, arrested for domestic violence multiple times, arrested for 
assault, has a drunk driving arrest, and has been in and out of jail and
prison for years.'

Not enough evidence: Prosecutors determined surveillance footage was not enough to secure a conviction

While many have accused Michael of 
interfering, his intervention on Friday had the full backing of 
Lindsay's legal team, including her lawyers and manager.

Michael's intervention failed as 
Lindsay phoned the police and he claimed she also kicked out her 
boyfriend Josh Chunn, who tried to reason with her.

She is now reportedly seeking a restraining order against her father to stop him from interfering in her life.
