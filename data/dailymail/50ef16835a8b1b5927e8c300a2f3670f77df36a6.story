Whatever you do, don’t try this at home.

While the BBC might think it’s a bright DIY idea, sawing the top off an old rusty gas canister to create a custom-made light fitting just happens to be illegal - and highly dangerous... and potentially fatal.

Renovators Ruth and Tony Lawrence’s idea was described as ‘a fantastic example of homespun  creativity’ on BBC2 show The House That £100k Built.

The canister was owned by gas company Calor, which yesterday condemned the 
programme, broadcast at 8pm on Wednesday October 2.

Renovator Tony Lawrence was praised for his 'innovation' for turning a gas canister into a lampshade on The House That £100k Built but Calor Gas said the process is illegal and can be fatal

A spokesman for Calor Gas said residue gas in the canister can explode when the metal is cut.

By law, all empty canisters must be disposed of by qualified technicians.

The programme gained an audience of 1.9million people who watched TV architect Piers Taylor encourage the couple to salvage junk from their Shropshire farmyard and put it to use indoors.

The pair were trying to build a new home 
for under £100,000 to replace their crumbling farmhouse, and were 
understandably glad to save on the cost of expensive light fittings.

Mr Lawrence was soon seen 
enthusiastically chopping the top off a large gas canister with a 
circular saw, sending sparks flying around his feet. 

Calor Gas said residue gas in the canister can explode when the metal is cut and branded BBC 'irresponsible'

He later proudly showed off his new improvised light shades to the TV cameras.

As the show’s narrator 
said: ‘Their low-cost solutions are a fantastic examples of homespun 
creativity and Tony’s prized cylinder lights are a great statement.’

‘We can’t believe the BBC and Endemol would be so irresponsible. I hope their insurance is good. This isn’t so much DIY, more DYI – Do Yourself In'

But
 it seems nobody in the programme - produced by independent company 
Endemol - realised just how close Mr Lawrence came to a nasty accident.

Experts said sawing canisters is potentially lethal as residue gas can be ignited by sparks caused by cutting the metal.

Last year, a 48-year-old man from 
Oxfordshire was killed when he tried to turn an old gas cylinder into a 
barbecue. It exploded as he used an angle-grinder to cut open the 
40-gallon drum.

In 2011, the health and Safety Executive 
fined a building company £2,000 after an employee suffered extensive 
burns while cutting open an empty canister.

Spokesman Paul Blacklock said: ‘Not only is sawing open a gas canister unlawful, it is also highly dangerous.

‘Decommissioning one of our gas canisters is an extremely hazardous process which should only be carried out by qualified technicians, in specialist facilities and by the bottled gas company that always own the cylinder - in this case Calor.

‘Given that someone killed themselves last year trying to convert an oil drum into a BBQ, the chances of someone getting hurt, indeed fatally, are extremely high.

‘We can’t believe the BBC and Endemol would be so irresponsible. I hope their insurance is good.

‘This isn’t so much DIY, more DYI – Do Yourself In.’

After it was alerted to the dangerous segment the BBC removed it from last week’s episode.

A spokesman for the programme said: ‘The episode of October 2, 2013, with Tony and Ruth featured a short section on the reuse of gas cylinders. Cautionary lines were included in the programme warning viewers that any modification of found objects needs to be carried out safely.

‘As soon as we were made aware that the cylinders remained the property of the gas company the programme was taken down from the BBC iPlayer.  We have also amended the programme for any further repeat.’
