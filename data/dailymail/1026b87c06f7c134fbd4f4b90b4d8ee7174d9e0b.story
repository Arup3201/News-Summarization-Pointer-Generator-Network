A nature-lover has completed a barking challenge of travelling across Europe to climb a different tree every day for a year.

Henrik Dahle, 36, clambered up the branches of 365 trees on his journey through 10 countries.

He scaled trees almost 100ft (30metres) high during and spent between 10 and 90 minutes a day climbing.

Mr Dahle, from Southampton, Hampshire, loved climbing trees as a child and said he wanted to experience the thrill of the adventure again.

He left the UK and took a tree-climbing road trip across France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

He also interviewed 80 people in the boughs of various pine, ash, oak, beech, silver birch and poplar trees to keep his mission interesting.

One of his most notable conquests was ascending a Norwegian spruce, which later was used for London's Trafalgar Square Christmas Tree.

He also climbed a tree in Norway on Christmas Eve dressed as Santa in minus 23 degrees temperature.

Mr Dahle said: 'Climbing a different tree every day for a year was a personal challenge.

'At first, I took a short part of the day out to find a tree and climb it, fitting it in around my everyday life.

Challenge: Dahle said he wanted to raise awareness about 'sustainability and staying in touch with nature'

'But as the project went on it took up more and more of my time and took over.

'I
soon realised it was going to get boring if it was just me, so I 
started to invite other people to join me and interviewed them up trees.'

Mr Dahle said he got the acorn for the unusual endeavour at a friend's party.

He said: 'Everyone was playing a game, messing around putting a pirate hat up a tree.

'I ended up joining in and it reminded me how much I enjoyed climbing trees as a kid.

'An idea came to me of holding an acorn in my hand and saying 'I am going to climb this tree.

'It's a sign of hope that the tree will grow and be big enough for me to climb, and that I'll still be around to do it.'

Henrik went travelling with six friends, regularly making them pull over so he could climb his next tree.

He said: 'A good tree needs enough branches, to pose a bit of a challenge, but also manageable so you feel comfortable.

'If you have to stretch too much and extend yourself, it's no fun. Once you're in the tree, there needs to be space to move around in.

'The friends I was with were very patient - they were always having to wait for me at the bottom of a tree.

'I
was adamant I had to climb a tree every 24 hours, and often we'd be 
driving for hours and hours, then have to stop for me to get a climb in 
before midnight.

'I'd get as high up in the tree as I could but had to be fairly careful - I also had a "no falling and dying" rule to stick to.

Mr Dahle said there was a serious point to the fun.

He said: 'I'm passionate about sustainability and staying in touch with nature.

'People were usually keen and excited when I told them about the project, and a bit curious about why I was doing it.

'When it was over, it felt very strange. You'd think I'd feel relieved but I had become so used to looking for the next tree it was odd not to anymore.'

In Bristol, he encouraged 44 people to join him in a tree - ranging from an eight-month pregnant woman, children to climbers aged in their fifties.

Mr Dahle interviewed a belly dancer, a class of schoolchildren, a Shaman's family and an economist in trees.

He also climbed a tree drunk, got his hair cut in a tree and disturbed a young couple kissing under a tree so he could climb it.

His family - some of whom had not seen him since he was a baby - joined him up his last tree, in Norway, for a 'family tree' party.

Mr Dahle, whose father is Norwegian, said: 'I loved the family tree, that might be my favourite.

'I'm sure some of my relatives were just humouring me, but they showed up.'

One of his earliest memories is from the age of three, when his brother made him climb a tree in the New Forest, Hants, in a game.

He is writing a book, 'Uptrees', about his adventure.
