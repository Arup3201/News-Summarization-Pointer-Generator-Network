It is one of the biggest days in the British racing calendar.

And no Epsom Derby would be complete without the presence of the country's most high-profile horse-racing fan - her Majesty the Queen.

The 87-year-old monarch was resplendent in a mint green dress coat with a co-ordinating hat as she arrived at Epsom Downs ahead of the Investec Derby today.

Favoured pastime: The Queen, a familiar face at all the major dates in the horse-racing calendar, visited Epsom Racecourse in Surrey ahead of the Derby today with her husband the Duke of Edinburgh

Bird's eye view: The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie observed all the action from their vantage point on the Queen's Stand at Epsom

Studying the form: The Queen was deep in conversation on the stand while the Duke of Edinburgh used his binoculars to get a better view

Sporting event: Princess Beatrice wore a cloche-style hat by milliner Karen Henriksen, and a monochrome dress with a circle print

The Queen and Prince Philip were joined by their granddaughters, Princesses Beatrice, 24, and Eugenie, 23 in the Surrey sunshine today.

The girls' father Prince Andrew, Duke of York, was also in attendance at Epsom today, making it something of a family affair for the royals.

Princess Beatrice, famous for her unorthodox choice of hat at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in April 2011, again decided on a statement headpiece for her day at the races.

Prince Andrew's eldest daughter wore a black and white patterned dress with black heels and gold jewellery, which she accessorised with an unusual maroon cloche hat by milliner Karen Henriksen and a matching clutch bag.

Princess Beatrice's dress was cinched at the waist with a black and gold studded belt.

Her sister Eugenie chose a more 
spring-like palette, wearing a full-skirted frock in shades of blue, 
white and taupe, with a co-ordinating taupe hat and nude heels.

Her hat was created by Sarah Cant, the couture milliner behind the cream headpiece Eugenie wore on Easter Sunday this year.

The Newcastle University graduate's 
patent shoes were similar to the LK Bennett heels famously favoured by 
Prince William's wife Kate Middleton.

Other famous faces spotted in the crowd on Derby day today included comedian Jack Whitehall and Les Miserables star Samantha Barks, who looked incredible in a knee-length body con dress and co-ordinating hat.

Glamour: Ladies' Day was yesterday but that didn't stop the girls pulling out all the stops for the Epsom Derby today

Ruler Of The World provided Aidan O'Brien with a fourth Investec Derby and maintained his unbeaten record under Ryan Moore at Epsom today - with favourite Dawn Approach well beaten.

Ruler Of The World (7-1) showed a smart turn of foot to go clear, but Battle Of Marengo, Galileo Rock and Ocovango all set off in pursuit.

The gap was closing at the line as Libertarian flashed home to claim second with Galileo Rock in third.

The race was watched by over 100,000 people at Epsom Downs.
