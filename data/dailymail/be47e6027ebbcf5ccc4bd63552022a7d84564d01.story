Potential Republican Presidential candidate Ben Carson said on Thursday that Americans should take cues from ISIS in how to stand up for what they believe in and to die for their cause.

The conservative Carson made the statement at the Republican National Committee winter meeting  and certainly raised some eyebrows.

While he said ISIS has the 'wrong philosophy' he lauded them for standing up for what they believe in through their violent actions. He likened them to America's founding fathers who waged revolutionary war against the British.

Raised eyebrows: Potential Republican Presidential candidate Ben Carson said on Thursday that Americans should take cues from ISIS in how to stand up for what they believe in and to die for their cause.

ISIS beheaded journalists last year and shared video of the gruesome attacks.

'We've got ISIS. They've got the wrong philosophy, but they're willing to die for what they believe, while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness,' he said.

'We have to change that.'

Carson told the audience he knew his controversial comments would get attention from the press but said he'll readily brush them off.

'Now I recognize that there's press here and some of the press will say, 'Carson said that ISIS is the same as the United States,' he said.

History of comments: Ben Carson, a retired surgeon popular with Tea Party conservatives known for making controversial comments, speaks at a luncheon during the Republican National Committee

'They are just so ridiculous, so ridiculous.'

Carson made headlines in the past for comparing the United States to Nazi Germany because they both 'work to silence their opponents,' reports CNN.

Carson has said he feels an urge to run for president, and that he 'feels fingers from God' pushing him towards his goal.

His blunt commentary has made him popular with the GOP and just last month he polled third in a CNN/ORC survey of the potential GOP presidential field, reports CNN.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus told NBC on Thursday that Carson was talking about standing up for beliefs.

'I think what he was saying basically was that you have to believe in what you stand for, and that we have to believe in the ideals of America, I didn't think anything odd of it,' he said.

'I think he was making a point, and I think his point was to stand up for the things that you believe in.'
