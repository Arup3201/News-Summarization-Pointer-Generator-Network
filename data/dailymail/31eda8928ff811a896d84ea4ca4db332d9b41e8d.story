U.S. women's national soccer team goalie Hope Solo sat on the bench on Saturday, as her team Seattle Reign FC played Sky Blue FC - just one week after she allegedly assaulted her sister and nephew in a drunken rage.

Seattle Reign announced before the home game that Solo would not start, Q13Fox reported. She did not play at all in the match, which ended 0-0.

Fans shared their disappointment about Solo's absence from the field with the affiliate station.

'Most of us came here to watch her and the better players on the team,' Kalea Kelly said. 'So yeah, we were kind of bummed.'

Shanna Keeger, a mother in attendance at Saturday's match, told Q13Fox she 'was a little disappointed about [Solo's] arrest, but not surprised.'

'I remember some of the past troubles she’s had. So I was disappointed, of course.'

On Thursday, Solo apologized on Facebook for her involvement in the 'highly unfortunate' incident at her sister's Kirkland, Washington house last Saturday, but insisted her 'name will be cleared'.

Solo allegedly her nephew in the face, and hit her sister over the head with a broomstick after showing up at the house angry after missing a flight.

'I would like to apologize to my fans, teammates, coaches, marketing partners and the entire US Soccer and Seattle Reign FC communities for my involvement in a highly unfortunate incident this past weekend. I understand that, as a public figure, I am held to a higher standard of conduct. I take seriously my responsibilities as a role model and sincerely apologize to everyone I have disappointed,' Solo said in the Thursday Facebook post.

'I love my family dearly. We, like all families, have our challenges but my sincere hope is that we are able to resolve this situation as a family. Adversity has always made us stronger and I know this situation will be no different.

'I also would like to thank everyone who has reached out with messages of support and encouragement. I truly appreciate your loyalty, concern and well wishes.'

'Due to pending legal issues, I cannot comment further at this time. However, I am confident in the legal process and believe my name will be cleared.'

Solo finished the message by saying she looks forward to getting back on the soccer field.

Her statement came two days after police in Seattle released the shocking 911 call that brought them to Solo's sister's house last Saturday.

'Hope solo is going psychotic - she's 
f***ing beating people up!' the unidentified caller tells a police 
dispatcher, in audio published by TMZ.

The goalkeeper, who is also one of the most recognizable 
faces on the U.S. Women's National Team, was arrested on Saturday night 
after the fight during a family barbeque.

Solo's
 unnamed 17-year-old nephew told investigators that the altercation 
became so heated, he had to retrieve a gun to defend himself from his 
enraged relative.

That revelation surfaced Monday, as 
Solo made her first appearance in court and plead not guilty to charges 
of domestic violence.

According to documents obtained by TMZ, Solo came over to the 17-year-old's house on Saturday night, angry after having missed a flight.

The two started talking and Solo became even more infuriated when she believed he was offending her.

Solo went on to tell her nephew that he would never be a pro athlete because he was 'too fat and crazy'.

The nephew went into another room where Solo continued to berate him, calling him a 'fat p****' when he called his mom.

'I then told her to get her c*** face out of my house' the boy told police.

That's when Solo got offensive and stared punching her nephew and grabbing his hair.

When the boy's mother intervened, Solo lashed out at her as well, beating her over the head with a broomstick.

Solo finally let up and left he house when the nephew called police.

Allegations: Solo is accused of hitting her sister and 17-year-old nephew early Saturday morning at the relative's house where a 'big party' was going on. Pictured above in court on Monday. Her next court appearance is scheduled for August 11

There for her: Hope's husband Jerramy Stevens appeared in court to support his wife. He is a former Seattle Seahawks tight end

After entering her not guilty plea in 
court on Monday, Solo was released without bail and ordered not to have 
contact with the alleged victims and to not drink alcohol.

Authorities
 say Solo was intoxicated during the assault, but her lawyer Todd 
Maybrown insists she was actually a victim in the altercation.

'Hope
 is not guilty of any crime,' Maybrown said in an email sent on 
Saturday. 'In face out investigation reveals that Hope was assaulted and
 injured during this unfortunate incident. We look forward to the 
opportunity to present the true facts in court and to having this matter
 behind Hope very soon.'

Solo was arrested at her sister's house just before 1am Saturday morning, after police were called to the Kirkland residence where a woman was hitting people and refusing to stop or leave.

According to a police report obtained by The Seattle Times, a male caller told 911 the 32-year-old was 'hitting people' at a family gathering.

'Officer arrived and immediately heard the sounds of the disturbance inside the residence,' the report noted.

'They entered and contacted several persons; one being Hope A Stevens (Solo) who appeared intoxicated and upset.'

Authorities said Solo's 17-year-old nephew and her sister had visible injuries.

'After receiving statements of the persons involved, Officers determined that Solo was the primary aggressor and had instigated the assault,' the report said.

Solo's sister has not been identified, but according to the soccer star's memoir she has a half-sister named Terry. Pictured above at a U.S. women's soccer match against Australia on October 20, 2013

Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray said there was 'a big party going on at her house'.

'It was an out-of-control situation' Lt. Murray told The Times.

Solo was booked into jail for investigation of two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault.

The sister was not identified by police, but in her memoir, Solo writes that she has a half sister named Terry.

Solo's late father, Jeffrey Solo, had two children, Terry and David, before divorcing his wife.He then remarried and had Hope and her brother, Marcus.

Solo has won two Olympic gold medals for the US women's national team. She also plays with the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League.

'We are aware of the situation with Hope and are now gathering information,' the Reign posted on the team's Twitter feed.

In 2012, she married former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens.

This isn't the first altercation Solo has had with police. Reports show police were called to a disturbance at her Kirkland home in the early hours on November 12, 2012, with her then-boyfriend Jerramy Stevens (pictured with Solo in 2013) arrested pending domestic violence charges. Stevens was released and the couple were married the following day

He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving her, but he was not charged. Maybrown represented Stevens in that case.

Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy.

'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said then. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.'

In her last appearance for the US, Solo recorded her 71st career shutout, a 1-0 victory over France on June 14 in Tampa, Florida. She sat out the team's game against France on Thursday night in Connecticut.
