After a disappointing World Cup there could be more trouble ahead for Italy striker Mario Balotelli, who has been caught smoking while on holiday in Miami.

The Milan forward, who was fined by his club last year for trying to smoke on a train, doesn't seem to be able to kick the habit, lighting up on his hotel balcony.

The 23-year-old is on holiday with fiance Fanny Neguesha after a World Cup in which he managed just one goal, a header against England, as Italy were eliminated in the Group Stage.
