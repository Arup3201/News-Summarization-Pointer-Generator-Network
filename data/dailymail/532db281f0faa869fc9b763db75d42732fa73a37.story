Former rugby league player, Keith Mason, 32, has spoken with officers regarding an alleged hit-and-run

Former rugby league star Keith Mason is being investigated by police over an alleged hit-and-run that saw a family, including a girl of eight, requiring hospital treatment.

Mason, 32, who played for Super League giants St Helens and Huddersfield, has spoken with officers about a collision in Birstall, West Yorkshire. 

A mother and her two daughters, aged eight and 11, were treated in hospital after the head-on crash between two cars.

They were in a Mini that was left badly damaged following the crash with a 4x4 Nissan Qashqai on Saturday afternoon.

A witness said the former rugby league prop reversed his damaged car afterwards.

The woman, a friend of the family who did not want to be identified, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'The car was smashed up and her youngest daughter hurt her neck and bit her lip - there was a lot of blood.

'The driver of the Nissan reversed after the crash. He got out of the car and came over.'

Mason was then said to have fled on foot.

Since retiring from Super League, Mason, who lives in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, has been pursuing an acting and modelling career.

He has already landed a role alongside Hollywood star Mickey Rourke in crime drama Skin Traffik and has said he would love to appear in a James Bond film.

At the time, he said: 'It's been a whirlwind. To have a part alongside some of the best actors there'll ever be is amazing. 

'I am just a normal lad from ­Yorkshire and now I am seeing all this glitz and glamour, it's surreal. But I am really enjoying the lifestyle. I could get used to it.

'I'm from a humble background, with a single mum who brought five kids up on a council estate. I've had nothing given to me, so I know I need to work very hard to get anywhere in life.'

Last year, 
Mason was awarded almost £150,000 in damages after his former club 
Huddersfield Giants sacked him when a naked picture of his team-mate, 
Scott Moore, was posted online. 

He was dismissed from the team on grounds of gross misconduct in October 2012 after the picture appeared on Twitter.

But
 Moore successfully argued that his  former employees wanted to get rid 
of him because of his expensive contract and that the Twitter picture 
was only a smokescreen.

Mason, who is now a budding actor and model, asked his Twitter followers on Wednesday if they would like to see him appear back in the Super League

West Yorkshire Police confirmed that Mason, who has not been arrested, is 'helping with enquiries'.

Richard Cramer, Mason's lawyer, told MailOnline: 'Keith is co-operating with the police and it would be inappropriate to make a comment at this time.'

A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police told MailOnline: 'Police were called to reports of a road traffic collision on Cambridge Road, Birstall at 4.53pm on Saturday August 9.

'The incident involved two vehicles, a Qashqai and a Mini. An eight year old child in the Mini was left with slight injuries.

'The Qashqai driver has got out and spoken with the Mini driver and then left his car and walked off from scene.

'Police have recovered the Qashqai and are treating it as a fail to stop collision.

'The registered owner of the Qashqai has been identified and is helping police with our enquiries.'
