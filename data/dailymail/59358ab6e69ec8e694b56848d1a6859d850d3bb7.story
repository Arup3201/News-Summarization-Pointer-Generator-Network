Chris Gayle has rejected speculation he will quit international cricket and confirmed he will target next year's World Twenty20 tournament despite persistent back problems. 

The West Indies opener posted 'I'm not leaving' alongside an Instagram video on himself singing along with an amused singer in Sydney on Sunday.

Gayle, laughing while attempting to hit the high notes as an amusing singer covers Sam Smith's Stay With Me, is no doubt referring to the picturesque Opera Bar on Sydney Harbour at which he's clearly enjoying himself.

But it also follows good news for fans of the 35-year-old's explosive and unpredictable batting style.

'Definitely want to play the T20 World Cup next year for West Indies, there's no doubt about that,' Gayle told ESPNcricinfo.

'I've got a few concerns and a few injuries to try and solve. I'll give myself some time and hopefully look back at it and see how well I can actually progress for West Indies cricket at this point in time.'

'I'm actually out of the Test series, the back won't hold up for that format at this point in time, but I haven't retired from any format as yet.' 

And why would Gayle retire if he's enjoying life both on and off the field.

Also on Sunday Gayle, who plays in the Big Bash League for the Sydney Thunder, posted happy snaps with a female police officer and of himself relaxing on a boat, along with an image on Twitter of a meal he was enjoying 'Back in paradise #Sydney' with the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the background.  

Gayle headed to Sydney after the West Indies were dumped out of the World Cup by an impressive New Zealand outfit on Saturday as his shortlived World Cup record of 215 was broken by Martin Guptill's remarkable 237. 

He smashed a 33-ball 61 in the Windies' unlikely chase but it was nowhere near enough as they lost the quarter-final by 143 runs.

Gayle posed for photos with Guptill after the match and was far from downbeat as he thanked West Indies supporters. 'It was fun while it lasted #CWC15,' he wrote on Instagram.

However, they won't see him for a while as a recurring back injury keeps him out of the three-match Test series against England starting next month. 

Gayle has played 103 Tests and 269 ODIs, and was instrumental in the West Indies' 2012 T20 triumph, a performance he's keen to replicate before hanging up his bat.
