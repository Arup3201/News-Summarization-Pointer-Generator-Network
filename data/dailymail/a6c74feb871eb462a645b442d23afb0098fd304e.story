Roy Hodgson has come under fire for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia.

The Liverpool star told the England manager that he was too fatigued to start the match in Tallinn after shouldering a heavy burden this season for both club and country.

Hodgson then made Sterling's comments public ahead of the match, which England won 1-0 thanks to Wayne Rooney's second-half free-kick.

England manager Roy Hodgson was criticised for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 win over Estonia 

Sterling did not make England's starting XI in Tallinn but came on as a second-half substitute

Sterling was replaced by his Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana in the starting line-up but came on as a second-half substitute.

Sky Sports pundits and former Liverpool players Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher both criticised Hodgson for not keeping their conversation private.

Redknapp said: 'I would never have dreamed of saying that [I'm too tired] to an England manager, but then I picked up a lot of injuries.

'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers would have been leaning on him, [saying] you need a break and this is an opportunity to get one.

'Why on earth did Hodgson say it though? Honesty is not the best policy. Why has Roy got into this? He could have said 'I want to freshen this up.' This wouldn't even be a conversation.'

Jamie Carragher, also talking on Sky Sports, agreed that Hodgson should have used more discretion 

Carragher agreed that discretion would have been a better idea: 'Me as a player, I would never give a manager a chance to leave me out.

'But keep it between yourselves, just come out and say Lallana played well last game and say Raheem needs a rest. But now we are having a debate on it.

'Hodgson could have been more careful, but I don't think Rodgers would have been involved.'

Sterling, 19, came off the bench to win the 74th-minute free-kick that led to England skipper Rooney curled in for his 43rd international goal.

Hodgson said after the game: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically.

Sterling's Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana started in his place in the England midfield diamond

'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said ''look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired''.

'So I said best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that.

'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything.

'It was a question of having two players, who both did pretty well against San Marino and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded, the other one is full of beans.

'We'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve.

'I think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they're 100 per cent when they aren't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity. I thought Lallana had a good game.'
