Confidence is running high in the England camp and Chris Robshaw believes his side have developed the composure to lose their ‘nearly men’ tag and finally challenge for the elusive Grand Slam.

England have finished second in every RBS 6 Nations since Stuart Lancaster took over in 2012, but the Red Rose side are now the bookies’ favourites to win the championship after their opening-round victory over Wales.

Robshaw’s side trailed 10-0 after just eight minutes at the Millennium Stadium, but the 28-year-old skipper believes previous heartbreaks ensured there was no panic in the face of adversity — contrasting Friday’s performance to the 30-3 defeat in 2013.

‘We probably weren’t as flustered, were we?’ said Robshaw. ‘Two years ago we probably panicked and chased things a little bit. The good thing was that no-one went off script. It was still reasonably early in the game and the guys stuck to doing their jobs.

‘We had a great win, but it’s a start to the campaign for us and that’s all. It’s about how we back it up because we’ve had some great wins in this tournament but unfortunately we haven’t picked anything up. We’ve got a triple crown, but the big prize at the end has eluded us three times. That’s our main objective.’

Next England must overcome wooden-spoon tipped Italy, and Robshaw has stressed the importance of not being caught off guard.

‘It’ll be a completely different pressure,’ said Robshaw. ‘I’m sure most people will expect us to win comfortably.

‘We’re treating them with the utmost respect, like we treat every other side that we’ve played. They will have nothing to lose.’
