Perhaps he had refused to help carry the shopping, or maybe he had lost the grocery list.

But whatever he did, this man bore the brunt of a woman's fury after she began pelting him with her shopping in the middle of the street - and all while captured on video.

A short clip shows the enraged woman emptying her shopping trolley - and launching a volley of potatoes, biscuits and packets at the startled man, all accompanied by her tirade of shrieks at him.

One local resident, who witnessed the attack, said today: 'I've never seen anything like it. 'They must have been husband and wife. She just started emptying her trolley and chucking all her shopping at him.

'When she ran out of things to throw - she picked up her trolley and battered him with it, but he still did not react or retaliate.

'I'm not sure what he had done but he was really in the doghouse for something.'

YouTube user bermudaviper, who uploaded the video, posted on the site: 'We were alerted to the disagreement by shouting which sounded like a dog barking.

'Woman goes mad at man in the middle of the street and starts emptying the contents of her shopping trolley to attack him including potatoes and milk.

'Workmen carry on with their work as though nothing happens. Amazing stuff.

'She wasn't exactly causing him any real harm.

'If things had turned nasty we would have stepped in and called the police.'

The pair  filmed it from the safety of behind some window blinds across the street.
