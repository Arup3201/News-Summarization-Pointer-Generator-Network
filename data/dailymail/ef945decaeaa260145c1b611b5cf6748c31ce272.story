She was last week dubbed ‘Two Kitchens Kate’ after installing a second kitchen at her Kensington Palace apartment, but The Mail on Sunday can reveal the Duchess of Cambridge has gone one better.

Kate is now installing a third new kitchen – this time at her and William’s country mansion in Norfolk –after replacing a lovingly-crafted £38,000 kitchen most young couples could only dream of.

Pictures of the out-of-favour kitchen at Anmer Hall, the ten-bedroom country bolthole William and Kate are renovating in North Norfolk, were proudly posted online by the designer couple who installed it about six years ago.

Gleaming: The lavish kitchen also boasted a white artisan espresso maker worth £630, and a £195 end-grain chopping block.  Even the drainage board represented the height of luxury, costing £275

Jamie and Jayne Everett, who run a bespoke kitchen design firm, installed the lavish kitchen – with gleaming surfaces and state-of-the-art appliances – when they lived at the Georgian mansion, which is  in the grounds of The Queen’s Sandringham Estate.

It featured £17,000 worth of beautifully hand-crafted hardwood worktops with inset double Belfast sink and elegant mixer taps, a large Aga costing £11,495 and an £8,630 fridge.

It also boasted a white artisan espresso maker worth £630, and a £195 end-grain chopping block.  Even the drainage board represented the height of luxury, costing £275.

But a Royal source, who asked not to be named, said the kitchen would probably be unrecognisable once Kate and William had turned it to their own taste, saying: ‘The couple have decided to make changes to the kitchen at Anmer Hall and a lot of what was there is not there any more.’

News of the redesign will be a blow to the Everetts, whose current website wishes the Duke and Duchess well in their new kitchen.

The couple posted a message alongside the photographs which reads: ‘We left behind one of the most gratifying kitchens we made, the Anmer Hall kitchen.

'The silver lining to this is that I am certain that the new occupants, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, are enjoying it as much as we did!’

The Duchess was dubbed Two Kitchens Kate after it emerged she and her husband had installed a second kitchen in their new Kensington Palace apartment.

Having already replaced the existing 350 sq ft kitchen designed by Princess Margaret’s husband Lord Snowdon, at  a reported cost to taxpayers of £170,000, William and Kate then wanted a second, private family kitchen in their four-storey home.

Royal officials have been keen to stress that the couple paid for this one themselves.

The cost of renovating Apartment 1A, which takes up more than half  of one of the wings at Kensington Palace, has now spiralled to more than £4 million.

Meanwhile, the refurbishments at Grade II-listed Anmer Hall are costing £1.5 million, which will be paid mostly by the Royal Family from private funds.

The figure includes £500,000 to replace roof tiles and a further half a million to landscape the front lawn.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman last night declined to comment on what she insisted was a  private matter.

The Everetts were unavailable  for comment.
