Oscar Pistorius is so paranoid about being poisoned in prison that he is reportedly surviving on tinned food from the tuck shop.

The Paralympic star, who was jailed four months ago for killing his girlfriend, has lost so much weight that his prosthetic limbs no longer fit him, according to local media.

The 28-year-old South African sprinter is allegedly refusing his daily rations at Kgosi Mampuru prison following death threats by fellow inmates.

Instead, he is using his monthly allowance of £9 to buy food at the tuck shop, including tins of ‘chakalaka’ - a spicy African vegetable concoction, reported South Africa’sYou magazine.

News of the fallen track star’s poisoning fears and dramatic weight loss follows an improvement in his prisoner status, as exclusively revealed by MailOnline last month.

Now a category A prisoner, the ‘Blade Runner’ is entitled to the maximum privileges afforded to a convicted inmate, including ‘contact’ visits, the freedom to wear jewellery, pursue a hobby and own a radio. His budget at the tuck shop has also increased, from £6 a month to £9.

Pistorius is four months into a five-year sentence for the manslaughter of Reeva Steenkamp, following a lengthy murder trial last year during which his doctor described the pain he suffers as a result of poorly-fitting artificial limbs.

The London 2012 star is being held on the hospital wing of the sprawling correctional facility in Pretoria, which is dominated by a violent gang culture, where he is said to have little contact with other inmates.

One of his neighbours is Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir, who is facing a number of charges including murder, with whom he shares a running machine and exercise bike.

In October, Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide over the death of 29-year-old Reeva at his home on Valentine's Day in 2013.

The double amputee shot the model four times through a locked toilet door after mistaking her for an intruder. He could be released from jail in August and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.

However, the state has appealed Pistorius’s acquittal on a charge of murder. The athlete’s own lawyers have challenged the ruling to allow the appeal. The next hearing in the case is next week.
