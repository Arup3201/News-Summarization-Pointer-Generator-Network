You're a mean one, Mr.Grinch.  

A California couple say a real-life Grinch stole Christmas from their autistic son.

Surveillance footage captures a man taking seven packages containing presents from Chuck and Colleen Saftler's Los Angeles home's porch Friday afternoon, according to CBS Los Angeles.

Around 3.30pm, a man is seen driving up the Saftler's driveway in a silver car, he unlatches the Saftler's fence and begins loading the packages from the porch in to the car.

The man, wearing dark pants and a gray, hooded sweatshirt then drives away.

CBS reports that the suspect followed a UPS truck who stopped at the family's home, the man then circled the block and returned to the Saftler's home to steal their packages. 

The family notified the police and Chuck, an FX Networks executive, even took to Twitter and Facebook, posting the surveillance footage, enlisting the help of the public to identify the man and save his son's Christmas. 

Though the thief took several presents from the Saftler's porch, Colleen and Chuck are most concerned about one.

For the last three years, their autistic son Jackson has asked for one thing for Christmas: the Disney Collection CD’s Volumes 1-4.

The Saftler's say that routine and predictability are vital to their son's day. The CD is the only gift Jackson asks for and the only gift he anticipates.

Jackson checks the mailbox religiously each day, waiting for a gift that already came -- and went. 

Many of the gifts are replaceable, the Saftler's told CBS, but the Volume 3 edition of the Disney Collection is hard to find.

Social Media: Chuck, an FX Network executive, shared the surveillance video on Twitter and Facebook, enlisting the help of the public to identify the thief 

So hard, in fact, the Saftler's only found the hard-to-find import in the UK. There is no time to replace or duplicate the CD in time for Christmas.

'It seems silly because it’s just a CD but to him it’s everything and this is all he wants and all he asked for and it’s not too much to ask for him to get something he wants for Christmas,' Colleen told CBS. 

'It’s not fair.'

Colleen and Chuck say they just want the CD back for their son.

'It’s gonna ruin [my son’s] Christmas,' Colleen said.
