As 12 million British hayfever sufferers struggle with the worst season for years, they are turning to private clinics for a 'wonder-cure' jab the NHS no longer offers because it is too 'toxic'.

Internet forums have been swamped by people fuming at not being able to get the injections from their GPs.

For many years, kenalog jabs were prescribed to those with the most severe symptoms, but they were withdrawn when it was realised they left patients at greater risk from contagious illnesses.

Suffering: People with hayfever are turning to private clinics who inject patients with a powerful drug which the NHS has rejected as 'toxic'

The injection contains the drug 
triamcinolone, a corticosteroid that suppresses the body's immune system
to prevent allergic reactions to pollen.

But it leaves the body open to infections such as chicken pox and measles, for three weeks after being administered.

Other potential side effects include bone
pain, easy bruising and bleeding, severe stomach and abdominal pain, 
shortness of breath and irregular heartbeats.

The 50mg or 100mg doses are 10 or 20 times stronger than the oral steroid tablets now offered on the NHS. In tablet form the steroid can be regulated for its effect on the body.

By suppressing the immune system, kenalog also leaves people unable to cope with serious illness or the trauma caused by an accident or sudden shock, for example being in a car crash.

Many of those posting on the internet believe the kenalog jabs have been withdrawn as a cost-cutting measure, but doctors fear the public simply does not realise how harmful this powerful drug can be.

Desperate: There are 12 million people with hayfever in Britain who are suffering in the worst season for years

Dr James Cave, whoÂ  edits the Drugs 
And Therapeutic Bulletin, said: 'Let's be clear, it's incredibly 
effective but just as you can light a barbecue with petrol, you can 
treat hayfever with kenalog, and I seriously suggest you don't because 
of the dangers associated with it.

'Kenalog does not have a place in treating hayfever, due to its significant side effects.

'For
three weeks after having the injection your immune system is 
suppressed, which means you are seriously at risk of infections like 
chicken pox and measles.

'Likewise
if you have a serious illness or a road traffic accident, you may not 
be able to cope with the stress, with kenalog suppressing your own 
stress reactions.'

Dr Cave said oral steroid tablets when
needed, combined with daily antihistamine tablets, nasal sprays and eye
drops, work for most sufferers.

This combination could be needed during the heatwave forecast for the rest of July.

Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP from Glasgow, added: 'This is not a drug that is suitable for hayfever, because its side effects outweigh dramatically any possible benefits.

'You can get the benefits in far less toxic ways.'

Beverley Adams-Groom, from the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit, warned that the pollen count will return to 'very high' for the next two weeks.

She said: 'The good news is that the better the weather during the main flowering season, the shorter the season will be, as the grasses become exhausted of pollen under continuing favourable conditions.

'The bad news is that very high counts mean greater symptoms for sufferers and a higher number of people are affected.

'We are now about halfway through the main grass pollen season.

'Fine weather forecast for much of July in the South means that the season should be over before the end of the month.

'In the northern regions, the weather outlook is not so good and this will extend the season a little into August, although there will be a mixture of risk over that time period.'
