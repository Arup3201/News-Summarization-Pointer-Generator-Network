Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has been greeted with a 21-gun salute during a state tour of China.

Mr Mugabe, 90, is in China with his wife Grace to ask for help to prop up his country’s ailing economy. Officials say he seeking funds to help rebuild decaying roads, rail and power facilities as well as faciities to help their agriculture industry.

His visit comes as central bank figures today revealed foreign investment into Zimbabwe plunged 59 per cent to $67million in the first half of this year.

Mr Mugabe was met with a 21-gun salute outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing before being ushered in to meet Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.

Mr Xi called Mr Mugabe a 'renowned leader of the African national liberation movement' and 'an old friend of the Chinese people whom we respect very much'.

He said: 'The traditional friendship between China and Zimbabwe was forged in the glorious years when we stood shoulder to shoulder against imperialism, colonialism and hegemony.'

The leaders oversaw the signing of a number of agreements, including on economic, trade and tourism cooperation and emergency food donations and concessional loans from China to the southern African nation. No details were immediately released.

Mr Mugabe has increasingly leaned on China for financial support after being shunned by Western trade and financial partners following his re-election in 2013

China invested more than £360million in Zimbabwe in 2013 and has granted more than £600million in loans.

Mr Mugabe told Mr Xi that Zimbabwe, being the smaller country, benefited more from the relationship, but said his government would do its best to 'reciprocate your friendship'.

Zimbabwe, a once-prosperous nation of 13 million people, has struggled since Mr Mugabe defeated rival Morgan Tsvangirai in a 2013 vote marked by allegations of irregularities. And he has increasingly leaned on China after being shunned by Western trade and financial partners.

His victory ended an uneasy power-sharing deal, but foreign investors have been deterred by concerns about corruption and government policies to force foreign-owned and white-owned businesses to cede 51 per cent of their shares to black Zimbabweans.

Hundreds of manufacturing companies have closed in the past year.

Announcing the drop in foreign direct investment in Zimbabwe, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor John Mangudya said exports, mostly minerals and tobacco, were also down 13 per cent in the first half of the year, to $1.3billion, compared with the first six months of 2013.

Mr Mangudya said: 'There is therefore need for the country to create an investor-friendly environment so as to tap into these external capital resources to boost employment, production and exports.'

Zimbabwe's economy is experiencing a serious dollar crunch and electricity shortages. Several companies have failed to pay salaries or have closed altogether, in a country where only 500,000 hold formal jobs.

The economy did return to growth in 2009, after nearly a decade of recession, when Mr Mugabe was forced to share power with his opposition rivals.

The government has cut its growth target for this year to 3.1 per cent from 6.1 per cent previously.

Mr Mangudya said the tough economic conditions had strained the capacity of companies and individuals to repay loans.

The percentage of non-performing loans out of total loans had risen to 18.5 per cent from 17 per cent at the start of the year. Banks in turn have tightened their lending to customers.
