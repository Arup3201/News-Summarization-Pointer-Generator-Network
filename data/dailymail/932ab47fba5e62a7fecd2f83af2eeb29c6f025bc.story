Shoppers at a supermarket in Cambridge were left baffled to see fruit and vegetable signs written in Welsh.

Customers at the Asda store at the Beehive Centre were confused to see the Celtic signs almost 200 miles away from Wales.

Thankfully, the banners which signpost fruit and vegetable aisles were also written in English so local residents were able to find their way around.

Lost in translation: Shoppers were baffled by the signs which give the Welsh names for fruit and vegetables

A spokesman for the store at the Beehive Centre in Cambridge said the signs were the result of a mix-up at the printers

'I was really confused when I went into the shop to buy some apples and saw all the Welsh signs,' said Catherine Wade, 38.

'None of them make any sense to me and I'm sure there are very few Welsh speakers in the city,' the local resident said.

'It's rather strange having them up in a shop that is so far away from Wales.'

A spokesman for the store said today the Welsh signs were put up as the result of a mix-up at the printers, leaving them no choice but to use what was available to them..

It is thought less than 20 per cent of the population in Wales is fluent in Welsh which is considered a minority language

One shopper expressed confusion at the signs, saying she was sure there were 'very few' local Welsh speakers

Staff at the store in Cambridge were reportedly joking with customers about the blunder, saying 'wps', the Welsh word for 'oops'

He said: 'The signs that are up in our stores at the moment are a temporary measure whilst we get the correct ones ready for the store.Â 

'In the mean time we invite all customers to have a go at brushing up on their Welsh.'

Store staff were reportedly joking with customers about the blunder, saying 'wps', the Welsh word for 'oops'.

Just 19 per cent of the population of Wales is fluent in Welsh which is considered a minority language.
