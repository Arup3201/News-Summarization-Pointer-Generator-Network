Technology-savvy criminals could be listening in to the conversations of people visiting voice-controlled websites using Google’s Chrome browser, one computer expert claims.

Computer security expert Tal Ater discovered that criminals could potentially use the web browser’s voice recognition abilities to invade users’ privacy.

While the Israeli programmer reported the problem to Google last September, he says the search giant has not yet fixed the issue.

Technology-savvy criminals could be listening in to the conversations of people visiting voice-controlled websites using Google's Chrome browser, one computer expert claims

After reporting the problem to Google 
last year, he immediately received a response from the company saying 
that their engineers were busy fixing it.

Mr Ater said that within two weeks of reporting the problem, a patch for the fix was ready.

'Google’s
 engineers, who’ve proven themselves to be just as talented as I 
imagined, were able to identify the problem and fix it in less than 2 
weeks from my initial report.

'I was ecstatic – they system works,' he 
wrote on a website dedicated to the problem.

But to date the solution has 
not yet been put in place.

Google says it has looked at the problem and found there was 'no immediate threat'

'This feature was designed with security and privacy in mind,

'We’ve re-investigated and still believe there is no immediate threat, since a user must first enable speech recognition for each site that requests it.

'The feature is in compliance with the current W3C standard, and we continue to work on improvements.'

Most websites that use voice recognition also use HTTPS secure servers, which means that Google Chrome does not have to ask permission every time it wants to run sound-sensitive software.

While this usually lets web users interact with sites that use voice-recognition more easily, it also means in this instance that there is potential for a cunning criminal to tap into the feature to invade peoples’ privacy, NBC News reported.

The programmer warned that as an HTTPS certificate of a secure server is not particularly hard to get hold of, a malicious web developer could programme an invisible pop-up window to let them listen and even record the conversations of users of Google Chrome – even after a specific speech recognition website has been closed down.

While the threat has been identified, no-one is sure how much a hacker could gain from exploiting the flaw and how much they could actually hear, as few people talk to their internet browsers unless they are purposely using a voice-recognition website.

However, video chat and online gaming users could be vulnerable to having their conversations listened in to.

Experts told NBC that anyone worried about the insecure feature should use an HTTP version of a website that uses voice-recognition, instead of the HTTPS version.

They added that they will notice the change as they will be asked permission every time they want to use voice recognition features.

Relatively few sites use voice recognition outside the realms of online gaming and chat services, but many people predict that it will soon be used by more people to navigate popular websites.
