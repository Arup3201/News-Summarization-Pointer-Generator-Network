A flight attendant has revealed the definition of a series of unusual words and phrases used by cabin crew.

For most people, hearing the expression ‘bidding’, ‘slam-clicker’ and 'coach-roach' will mean virtually nothing at all.

But to the experienced stewards and stewardesses, it is a language they are very familiar with.

Flight attendant Sarah Steegar has revealed the definition of a series of unusual words and phrases used by cabin crew. 'Pax' is slang for 'passengers'

Sarah Steegar, a flight attendant with a major US carrier for the past 15 years, explains the hidden meaning behind many of the words.

Writing for the frequent flyer website Flyertalk, Ms Steeger reveals what exactly the crew are talking about when they use their own code in-flight...

Bidding

‘This is the monthly process of telling the airline what you’d like for your next work schedule — a competition based on seniority.’

Deadhead

Everybody loves this one, but few use it correctly. It means flying as a passenger — as a company assignment. 

Basically, the airline needs you to be somewhere other than where you are, and you cannot or are not needed to work the flight. Best guess is it’s an old theatre term.

Slam-click(er): ‘When a crew member goes to the hotel and does not emerge again until it’s time to leave'

Coach roach: ‘Used wryly, usually for flight attendants who prefer working in the main/coach cabin'

Furlough

When airlines need to shrink, most don’t 'lay off,' they 'furlough.' 

If the business bounces back within a certain amount of time, the airline has to offer you your job back before they can hire new stews or pilots off the street.

Pax

‘Passengers’.

Slam-click(er)

When a crew member goes to the hotel and does not emerge again until it’s time to leave. 

As in: slamming the door and clicking the lock. End of story. Can be used as a noun or a verb. ('I’m so tired I’m just gonna slam-click.' or 'You won’t see her for dinner. She’s a slam-clicker.)’

Coach roach

Used wryly, usually for flight attendants who prefer working in the main/coach cabin. 'Business? No thanks. I’m a coach roach all the way, baby!'

Bidding: According to Ms Steegar, the expression refers to 'the monthly process of telling the airline what you’d like for your next work schedule — a competition based on seniority'

Blue juice

The blue water in the toilets. Not to be confused with your bonus term, 'crew juice', a special cocktail to be enjoyed on the van ride to a long layover hotel, usually as a sort of sleep-aid after an all-night flight.

Recipes vary and may be subject to competitive secrecy.

Crotch watch

Nickname for walking through the cabin to do a seatbelt check. Also called a 'groin scan'.

Landing lips

To put on 'landing lips' is to refresh one’s make-up at the end of a flight.
