President Barack Obama rolled out
a sweeping set of measures on Thursday to significantly ease the
half-century-old embargo against Cuba, opening up the country to
expanded travel, trade and financial activities.

The new regulations, which take effect on Friday, will allow
Americans to travel to Cuba for any of a dozen specific reasons,
including family visits, education and religion, without first
obtaining a special license from the U.S. government as was
previously the case.

Though general tourism will still be banned, those U.S.
travelers who do visit will be allowed to bring home small amounts of
the Cuban cigars that are highly rated by aficionados.

A new set of U.S. government regulations that take effect on Friday, will severely loosen the 50-year long travel and trade restrictions on the country, but Americans still won't be able to go to Cuba just for vacation

The United States will ease travel and trade restrictions with Cuba in keep with last month's agreement to begin normalizing ties with the Cold War-era foe. The White House said today it thinks Congress should throw out an embargo on travel to Cuba

Defying hardline critics in Congress, Obama
made good on a commitment he made a month ago to begin loosening
some U.S. economic sanctions against the communist-ruled island
as part of an effort to end decades of hostility.

The Treasury and Commerce Departments issued a package of
new rules that will allow U.S. exports of telecommunications,
agricultural and construction equipment, permit expanded travel
to Cuba and authorize some kinds of banking relations.

It was the first tangible U.S. step to implement the changes
Obama pledged on Dec. 17 when he and Cuban President Raul Castro
announced plans to restore diplomatic relations between the old
Cold War foes.

'Today's announcement takes us one step closer to replacing
out-of-date policies that were not working and puts in place a
policy that helps promote political and economic freedom for the
Cuban people,' Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a
statement. 

The revamped rules will also make it easier for U.S.
companies to export mobile phone devices and software as well as
to provide Internet services in Cuba. U.S. airlines will be
permitted to expand flights to the Caribbean island.

In an expansion of remittances allowed, Americans will now
be able to send up to $8,000 to Cuba a year, up from the $2,000
previously permitted, and bring $10,000 with them when they
travel to the country.

They will also be able to use credit and
debit cards in Cuba and bring up to $400 worth of goods back to America with them. That amount includes $100 of alcohol and tobacco products.

In addition, there will be a change in the definition of 
'cash in advance' payment required by Cuban buyers, which could
help a variety of business interests, most notably U.S.
agriculture, in gaining greater access to Cuban markets.

The announcement was made after the Obama administration
said on Monday that Castro's government had fulfilled its
promise to free 53 political prisoners as agreed with the U.S.
government.

It also comes a week before high-level U.S.-Cuba
talks in Havana aimed at starting to normalize ties. 

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson will hold high-level negotiations in Havana on Jan. 21-22 aimed at starting the normalization process. The discussions will include efforts to reopen embassies in both countries.

Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, called the steps a
'significant step' in delivering on Obama's new direction on
Cuba. In announcing the shift in December, the president said
that decades of trying to force change in Cuba by isolating the
island had not worked.

'We firmly believe that allowing increased travel, commerce,
and the flow of information to and from Cuba will allow the
United States to better advance our interests and improve the
lives of ordinary Cubans,' he said in a statement.

But Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and
forceful critic of the policy shift, said it would hurt ordinary
Cubans.

'This is a windfall for the Castro regime that will be used
to fund its repression against Cubans, as well as its activities
against U.S. national interests in Latin America and beyond,' he
said in a statement.

While Obama is using executive powers to poke holes in trade
barriers with Cuba, only Congress can lift the longstanding
embargo.

'Normalizing relations with Cuba would allow greater travel,' Earnest told reporters today. 'However there are limits to what the president can change in that relationship using his executive authority.'

Earnest said the Obama administration would like to see Congress do away with all of the restriction on Cuba. With Republicans controlling the Senate and the House,
there is little chance of that happening any time soon, though.
