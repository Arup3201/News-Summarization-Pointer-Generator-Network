Katie Piper has announced her engagement to carpenter boyfriend James on Twitter this morning

She posted the tweet on Saturday morning where she told fans she is due to be married after proposal last night

It is thought the pair dressed up for a romantic evening and a three-course dinner at their home in London yesterday.

She posted a picture on Instagram last night of her meal of baked cod capers, cooked by her now fiance and father of their baby daughter, Belle Elizabeth, who was born in March this year.

Alongside the pictures she wrote: 'Pretending we are going out for dinner! Cooking 3 course meal, dressed in our best clothes- all taking place at our kitchen table! Parents night in/out #nobabysitterneeded.'

With her second snap she posted: 'I think my boyfriend has potential as a chef! Baked Cod with Capers,' before making the big announcement on Twitter today.

Katie gave birth to baby daughter Belle Elizabeth in March this year. Her due date was Thursday, March 27, 2014 - the date of the six-year anniversary of when she was raped by her ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch

The couple met after being set up by friend Juliet, who gave James her number.

They shared their first phone call, which Katie admits was 'nervous and stilted' but they soon started to relax, telling each other about their jobs. 

The pair arranged to meet up for a drink and a trip to the cinema. 'I figured that if he did turn out to be a starer, at least going to the cinema would keep his eyes elsewhere,' Katie said.

'James was chatty, witty and looked me squarely in the eye. He never once mentioned my burns, and because he didn’t, I didn’t either.

'He didn’t even stare at them, so I didn’t feel self-conscious. He had me relaxed and buzzing with confidence.'

The couple soon started dating and became official before finding out they were expecting a baby in March, this year. 

Katie was just 24 when her ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch organised for a man to throw industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face. 

At the time, her modelling career was taking off and she had recently been crowned Miss Winchester in a beauty pageant.

She had also begun presenting on small digital television channels, primarily shopping channels, and decided to leave her parents' home in Hampshire for the capital. 

It was here she met Lynch - a martial arts enthusiast - who had been tracking her media and modelling career closely.

In October, the acid attack survivor was awarded an honorary degree at Anglia Ruskin University, in Chelmsford, Essex (left) and right pictured earlier this year

He approached her on Facebook and the pair decided to meet up in person in Reading, where Katie was working at the time.

But two weeks into the relationship, the couple booked into a hotel in Bayswater following a meal out, where Lynch raped, beat her and stabbed her several times in the arms.

After eight hours in the hotel they drove back to her flat in Golders Green and she later sought medical treatment, though she was too scared to tell doctors what had really happened.

Two days later, he persuaded her to go into an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account, where outside her flat she was approached by a man in a hoodie.

She thought the man - Stefan Sylvestre, who Lynch hired to carry out the attack - was going to ask for money but instead he threw the liquid in her face.

Katie has gone on to present television programmes, while her ex Danny Lynch has been jailed for 12 years

Writing in the Daily Mail after the attack, she said: 'When the large cupful of acid hit my smooth, soft, line-free skin, trickling down my throat and partially blinding me, he almost succeeded in extinguishing the last of the old Katie. Almost.

'In the aftermath, I was horrified by my own reflection, barely recognising the image of myself in the mirror. I would play back memories of all the relationships I’d ever had, trying to ingrain in my mind what it felt like to hold hands, to kiss.

'I was sure I’d never be attractive to anyone again, never be intimate. Never be loved.'

The attack was caught on CCTV and both Lynch and Sylvestre were arrested and given two life sentences - Lynch will serve a minimum of 12 years. 

She has since endured more than 100 operations to rebuild her face and set up the Katie Piper Foundation to raise awareness of the issues facing burns victims.

Katie has also taken part in a number of documentaries and written her autobiography.
