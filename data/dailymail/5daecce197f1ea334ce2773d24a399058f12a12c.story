Forget the sun-kissed sands of Sardinia, Majorca or Greece – for the best beach experience, you’re better off travelling to Wales.

That’s according to a poll of tourists which placed Swansea’s Rhossili Bay at number three on a list of Europe's best beaches. The three-mile stretch of white sand on the Gower Peninsula, was the UK’s top destination.

Other British resorts on the survey by 
TripAdvisor were Woolacombe Beach in Devon, which was fifth, with 
Cornwall’s Porthminster Beach at St Ives in ninth place.

Beautiful landscape: Councillor David Phillips, leader of the City and County of Swansea said he was 'delighted, but not surprised' that Rhossili Bay has been acknowledged as the third best beach in Europe

Spectacular: The three-mile beach is overlooked by the National Trust's most popular holiday cottage, the Old Rectory, and the remains of a 1887 shipwreck can be seen on the beach at low tide

Superb views: The three-mile stretch on the Gower Peninsula, was the UK's top destination. From the highest point on the Peninsula, ramblers can see across the sea to West Wales and the north Devon coast

On the list of Britain’s best beaches, 
Longsands Beach at Newcastle upon Tyne was fourth, while in fifth place 
was Hengistbury Head in Bournemouth.

The beach is overlooked by the National Trust's most popular holiday cottage, the Old Rectory, and the remains of a 1887 shipwreck can be seen on the beach at low tide.

From the highest point on the Gower Peninsula on Rhossili Down, ramblers can see across the sea to West Wales and the north Devon coast.

A number of rare insects, plants and birds and can be seen, such as the black bog ant, yellow whitlow grass and choughs. The area has been shaped by farming since the Stone Age and Iron Age forts can also be found on the coast.

Dorset had two more beaches in the UK top ten – Weymouth, in seventh place, and Sandbanks in Poole in eighth. Making up the rest of the list are Fistral Beach in Newquay, Cornwall – sixth – with Filey Beach in Yorkshire and St Brelade’s Bay Beach in Jersey at nine and ten.

The top European beach was Rabbit Beach at Lampedusa in Sicily, with Playa de las Catedrales in Rabadeo in Galicia, Spain, in second place.

the Turks and Caicos second.
