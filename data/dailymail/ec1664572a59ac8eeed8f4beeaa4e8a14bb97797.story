Harry Wilson struck the winner with just two minutes remaining as Liverpool beat Real Madrid in a UEFA Youth League thriller on Wednesday afternoon.

The Reds had surrendered a two-goal advantage at Langtree Park but weren't deterred and snatched victory when Jordan Rossiter teed up Wilson for a cool side-footed finish.

It means Liverpool are top of Group B at the midway point, joining Basel and Real on six points from their opening three matches.

Liverpool started the contest brightly and signalled their intent by creating a couple of early chances.

Ryan Kent delivered a free-kick from wide on the left that just evaded the far post and Wilson's swerving strike had a similar fate.

But they didn't have to wait much longer for the breakthrough, which arrived on the quarter-hour. In an almighty goalmouth scramble, Wilson struck the post and Jerome Sinclair fought to keep the move alive before Cameron Brannagan rattled the ball home.

The lead was extended five minutes later - when Wilson curled his free-kick onto the post it bounced out fortuitously for Tom Brewitt to slam home from close range.

Liverpool continued to press and Wilson could easily have made it three when he seized on a loose pass inside his own half and scorched forward. Goalkeeper David Oliveros saved his effort and Sinclair's follow-up was blocked on the line.

Real gradually grew into the contest and won a penalty when Adam Phillips was penalised for a high challenge on Cristian Cedres.

But Liverpool got away with it, Borja Mayoral slicing the spot-kick high over the crossbar.

Shortly before half-time, Real fired another warning shot when Aleix Febas rattled the frame of the goal.

The Spanish side emerged from the break refreshed and halved the deficit just eight minutes in. Alvaro Tejero attacked down the right and his accurate cross was nodded in off the crossbar by Philipp Lienhart.

They were level on 67 minutes when substitute Borja Sanchez drove forward, played a one-two with Scot Jack Harper, and fired the ball in off the post.

But they couldn't use their momentum to go on and win the contest. Instead it was Liverpool who claimed a dramatic late win when Wilson struck with just seconds to spare.
