An Islamic State terror attack on soldiers in their barracks in Britain is believed to be so likely, 'It's not a question of if, but when', a security specialist warned today.

Threat expert Will Geddes said that reports of up to three Isis terror cells planning attacks on troops were 'highly likely', adding: 'I think three is probably a conservative figure'.

And he said that a second threat was the high likelihood of a 'lone wolf' terror attack here, similar to those that killed two soldiers in Canada this week.

'Unlike the Al Qaeda-style "big spectaculars" such as 9/11, 7/7, and the Madrid bombings, the threat from Isis is a much more low-level, under the radar, visceral type of terrorism, often involving just one or two lone wolves operating alone,' he told MailOnline.

An attack on soldiers in Britain is so likely, 'it's not a question of if but when', a terror expert said today, in the wake of the murder of Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, left,  by Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 26, in Canada

Mr Geddes said the spontaneity of 'lone wolf' terrorists, who could buy a knife and attack people in a landmark location such as Oxford Street, pictured, made them difficult for counter-terror agencies to detect in advance

Mr Geddes, of security and counter terrorism firm International Corporate Protection, spoke after Whitehall sources reportedly said they had discovered Isis terror cells carrying out surveillance on four barracks across the country.

The worrying intelligence suggested an attack on British troops and their families - similar to the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in May last year - might be imminent.

Mr Geddes said: 'Sadly it's not a question of if, but when.  I certainly think we will see something.'

His warning coincided with recent arrests of terror suspects.  Last week four British men were charged with terror offences after allegedly carrying out 'hostile reconnaissance' of Shepherd's Bush Police Station and White City Territorial Army Barracks in west London using Google street view. 

As well as the threat from terror cells involving several terrorists working together, British security agencies are concerned about the increasing risk from radicalised individuals

Mr Geddes said such attacks might be planned by two types of Islamic extremists - those who wanted to join Isis in Syria but were unable to, like Ottawa gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 26, whose passport had been confiscated by authorities, and those who had been over there but had returned to home turf with the desire to carry out an attack there.

The security expert said:'The lone wolf attack by just one or two people is the biggest concern to British security agencies, particularly the spontaneity of such attacks.

'You can go into Argos, buy knives, and be out on Oxford Street attacking people within an hour, which makes such attacks very difficult to predict.

'The degree of violence that is potentially being deployed by these extremists is of especial concern - they are wanting to execute someone - behead them - in the street, and the fact that these days people tend to whip out their phones and record things means the impact of such an attack would be huge.'

He said the best weapon against such an attack was the vigilance of members of the public, and urged people to report any suspicious behaviour immediately. 

Security agencies are said to be 'working all hours' fighting the terror threat on home soil, witnessed by the high rise in the number of recent terror arrests.

Military personnel and police officers, particularly those who wear uniform in the street, have been warned to be alert to the dangers, and Prime Minister David Cameron has spoken to the heads of MI5 and Scotland Yard to review security at landmark buidings in Britain.

His talks with MI5 boss Andrew Parker and Met police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe came in the wake of Wednesday's fatal attack by Muslim convert Zehaf-Bibeau on Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, as he guarded the National War Memorial in central Ottawa.  The gunman then stormed the parliament building before being shot dead by former Mountie, sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers, 58.
