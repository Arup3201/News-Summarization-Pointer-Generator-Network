Huddersfield chairman Dean Hoyle passed up the opportunity to sign Rickie Lambert for just £750,000 in 2009 as his age 'didn't represent good value for money'.

The England international was a target for Huddersfield in 2008-09 before he joined Southampton from Bristol Rovers, which led to a £4million return to his boyhood club Liverpool this summer.

Although the 32-year-old is almost certain to be part of England's World Cup squad, Hoyle decided not to pursue the club's interest in Lambert at the time.

No regrets? Huddersfield turned down the chance to sign Rickie Lambert for just £750,000 in 2009

Oops! Dean Hoyles didn't sign Lambert from Bristol Rovers because he wasn't 'good value for money'

Speaking to the Huddersfield Examiner on July 7, 2009, Hoyle said: 'A move for Rickie Lambert is a no-no.

'No disrespect to a very good player, but it’s a simple matter of economics. Any deal would cost a minimum of £750,000 plus add-ons for a player who is 27 and who would want a three-year contract.

'Even if he scored 30 goals a season for those three years, by the time the contract is at an end, the player would be 30, and therefore there would be little or no resale value.

Red alert! Lambert has since completed a £4million move to his boyhood club Liverpool

'That means that even before meeting wage demands, the signing would cost £5,000 a week, and this club cannot do that kind of business.

'If Rickie Lambert was 22 or 23, it would be a different matter, but he’s not and suggestions that we will sign him are nonsense.'

The Huddersfield chairman may regret those words after seeing Lambert complete his dream move to Liverpool where he will be challenging for the Premier League title while playing in the Champions League next season.
