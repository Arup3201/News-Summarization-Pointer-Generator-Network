In his angry New York Times piece from Friday in which he vehemently denied sexually abusing his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, more than 20 years-ago, Woody Allen also took the chance to address the parentage of Ronan Farrow.

Last fall, Mia Farrow set tongues wagging across Hollywood when she hinted in a Vanity Fair article it was 'possible' Ronan was in fact the son of singer Frank Sinatra and not Allen.

In his Times piece, Allen seems willing to accept that Ronan is not his son - and then uses this possibility as a way to attack Mia Farrow's fidelity towards him during their relationship, to accuse her of lying under oath if this is true and of subsequently taking child support from him fraudulently.

Paternity: Woody Allen has claimed in the New York Times that if Ronan Farrow is not his biological son as Mia Farrow (right) has hinted at then she lied under oath and scammed him out of money he paid in child support

Indeed, Allen, 78, writes that Ronan, 26, who is due to begin hosting his own MSNBC current affairs program imminently, could be Old Blue Eye's boy - but questions what that means for the honesty of his former girlfriend, Mia Farrow.

'Is he my son or, as Mia suggests, Frank Sinatra’s? Granted, he looks a lot like Frank with the blue eyes and facial features, but if so what does this say?'

The Oscar winner goes on to claims that Mia Farrow told the 1992 custody hearing for their children and adoptive children that Ronan - then named Satchel - was his biological son.

'Even if he is not Frank’s, the possibility she raises that he could be, indicates she was secretly intimate with him during our years. Not to mention all the money I paid for child support. Was I supporting Frank’s son?'

The fact that Ronan might not be a biological relative of the Annie Hall director and star leads him to question Mia Farrow's 'integrity and honesty' for making the claims in the first place.

This was just one small part of his near-two thousand word essay in which he defended himself on Friday against the claims of sexual abuse leveled towards Allen.

He accused ex-partner Mia Farrow of being spiteful and malevolent and publicly denied being a child abuser.

His harsh words for Farrow came in an open letter published online by The New York Times.

The 78-year-old filmmaker said Dylan Farrow's open letter published last week included 'creative flourishes that seem to have magically appeared during our 21-year estrangement'.

At the time of the breakup of their 12-year relationship more than two decades ago, Mia Farrow accused Allen of molesting Dylan.

Allen has consistently denied the abuse allegation.

The director, who said the letter will be his final word on the matter, added that he still loved his daughter and missed being a part of her life.

Allen claimed in his letter that the then seven-year-old Dylan was coached by Mia Farrow.

'I did not molest Dylan. I loved her and hope one day she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a loving father and exploited by a mother more interested in her own festering anger than her daughter’s well-being,' he wrote.

Dylan Farrow claimed in her open letter that Allen abused her in 1992 at the family's Connecticut home.

She quickly rebutted his claims on Friday, saying: 'His op-ed is the latest rehash of the same legalese, distortions, and outright lies he has leveled at me for the past 20 years.'

She accused her adopted father of trying to 'discredit and silence' her, and said she was sticking by the claims she first made when she was seven years old.

In her open letter, Dylan Farrow claimed that Allen used his ‘sexual relationship’ with her stepsister, Soon-Yi, to cover up the abuse Dylan herself had allegedly suffered at his hands.

‘That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,’ Miss Farrow wrote. ‘I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls.’

Dylan candidly talked about the effect the alleged ordeal had on her later life, including a battle with eating disorders and her terror at being touched by men. The woman also said she began cutting herself.

Indeed, it is claimed that Frank Sinatra continued to look out for ex-wife Mia Farrow long after their split and even more than 20 years later he remained concerned about her well-being, claims a new book by lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

High-powered attorney Dershowitz represented Farrow in her long custody battle with Woody Allen in the early 1990’s after their ended over his relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi.

In his new book, Taking The Stand, Dershowitz reveals that Sinatra personally called him during that time to offer his help in Farrow’s battle.

Dershowitz writes of receiving a phone call from Sinatra, reports the New York Post. ‘He immediately got down to business,’ wrote Dershowitz.

'I love Mia. We were married, you know. She’s a great girl. Woody’s trying to bully her. He can’t be allowed to get away with that. What can I do to help?'

When Dershowitz told Sinatra that he had the case under control, he claims that Sinatra said: ‘Well, beyond the legal case, what can I do to call Woody off?’

Wary of Sinatra’s tough-guy reputation, Dershowitz wrote: ‘I nervously told him to leave it to the lawyers, and that any approach to Woody Allen would be used against Mia and would likely backfire.

In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Farrow stated that her son Ronan – born in 1987 while she and Allen were still together - could ‘possibly’ be the biological son of Sinatra.

In the same article she claimed that she and Sinatra, who were married between 1966 and 1968, ‘never really split up.’

News of Sinatra’s keen interest in Farrow’s custody case with Allen over their children, adds further weight to the rumors that he may have fathered Ronan.

Now 25, the Yale-educated former Obama administration aide is set to launch his own talk show geared toward millennials on MSNBC in February.

Dylan Farrow's decision to offer a first-person account of her torment has been spurred by Allen's latest nomination for an Academy Award and last month’s Golden Globes ceremony, where he received the prestigious Cecil B DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award.

‘It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away,’ she wrote.

Farrow, who described herself as a happily married woman, did not shy away from condemning the actors who have starred in her father’s films over the years, some of whom were on hand January 12 to present Allen with his Golden Globe.

‘What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?’ she asked.

Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have been unwavering in their support of her.

On the night of the Golden Globes ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's alleged assault in a scathing tweet.

‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ the newly hired MSNBC host wrote.

Dylan Farrow concluded her letter with an appeal to the movie-going public to think twice before they rush to heap praise on her talented adoptive father.

‘So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter.

‘Are you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?’
