In a sweltering Miami afternoon, hundreds of guys are sitting in an airless hotel reception room taking notes, hanging on every utterance by the speaker.

They’ve paid up to $3000 to be here – to learn from the master himself.

On the podium at the front isn’t a religious guru. It isn’t a business leader imparting the secrets of getting rich. It’s a guy dressed in jeans and an unironed shirt – teaching men what should be the most natural thing of all: how to talk to women.

The master: Julien Blanc is a dating coach at Real Social Dynamics and commands fees of up to $3,000 to teach men his secrets

Julien Blanc, 25, is one of the most renowned 'pick-up artists' around.

As a dating coach for Real Social Dynamics, the company founded by Tyler Durden (Owen Cook) and Papa (Nick Kho), Mr Blanc and his colleagues have near-rock star status amongst the men who’ve traveled from across the U.S. – earnestly writing down every insight on how to make yourself more attractive to women, and how no woman is beyond you.

'Why on earth would you need an excuse to talk to a girl?' Mr Blanc thunders from the front of the room. Scores of baseball caps nod, pencils scribble.

I’ve joined the disciples for a weekend’s bootcamp as part of my TV show, Tim Samuels: The Hunt for Real Men, which explores what it’s like to be a man today.

Taking notes: The author Tim Samuels traveled to Miami, Florida to learn Mr Blanc's secrets of how to pick up women

Closing the deal: As part of the bootcamp, Mr Samuels was forced to interact with female strangers in public and ask for phone numbers

How has it come to this, that men have to pay to learn how to meet women?

I sit through the lectures feeling a little smug and incredulous that guys are paying serious cash for a bit of confidence boosting and common sense.

1. Never walk directly towards a woman - approach from the side as it's less threatening

2. Don't mumble - speak as though you're on stage doing a spot of Shakespeare

3. Don't hang around like a bad smell

4. Try and take the woman away from her group to talk somewhere quiet

5. Don't leave without getting a phone number

But then we’re told that after lunch 
we’ve moving from the theory to the practical – chatting up total 
strangers on the street. The dread kicks in.

For a British bloke, the idea of walking up to a woman on the street, mid-afternoon, entirely sober and having to chat her up with the aim of getting her phone number is a living nightmare. Committing armed robbery or heading on holiday to northern Syria would be less terrifying. 

What on earth would you say as an opening line? How would you not sound like a complete cheese ball?

Before I can bail out, Mr Blanc leads a small group of us down to the main pedestrianized shopping street.

1. Don't speak to groups of models about woollen socks

2. Check for a wedding ring first

3. Check for a pram first

4. Do give up when the woman doesn't speak a word of English

5. Don't fight your national upbringing - drink at least four pints of lager before attempting any interaction

Women
 are going about their business – catching up with friends over coffee, 
popping into shops, heading to fashion week events, and generally 
displaying no inclination to want to be bothered by men who are paying 
good money to learn how to bother them.

As a few of us hang back, he demonstrates that he’s not all talk.

He brazenly heads over to Starbucks 
where a woman is stood outside, walks up to her, asks her where she’s 
from and gets chatting. Just as that’s going well, another woman walks 
past on her way into a store – he stops her, and then brings her into 
the conversation.

A 
classic technique - which demonstrates manly confidence, engenders a 
spot of competition and creates that all-important vibe that 'you’re at 
the center of your own party'.

Lo and behold, the second woman then asks for his number and what he’s doing that night. Astonishing stuff. And sober.

Lining up: The author sat in a room packed with men who paid $3,000 each to learn how to interact with women

Buoyed by this display of manliness, I’m sent off to do my own stranger-bothering. The first girl I approach doesn’t speak a word of English. She sounds Russian. I deploy my full repertoire (‘glasnost’ and ‘perestroika’) – but she remains impassive.

I’m then directed to a pair of women 
who are having coffee. One has a pram. Neither has any time for me. 
Before I’d even opened my mouth, they raise a hand – traffic cop style –
 to signal don’t even think of approaching.

Down but not out, I’m pushed towards two models – who at least don’t raise any limbs towards me.

What
 then follows is two minutes of dire conversation, where all I can think
 to ask about is where to buy socks around here, and bore myself into 
submission, like a football player signalling to the coach that he wants
 to come off the field.

In the field: Mr Blanc demonstrates how to master the game by getting a woman's attention

Training tactics: Mr Blanc coaches his students to develop enough confidence to approach complete strangers

Gaining confidence: The men are coached through a series of scenarios and told to visualize themselves being at the center of their own party

With confidence shot to pieces, I make my final approach – to a waitress taking a break.

After some initial confusion about where she came from – ‘Barcelona’ and ‘Macedonia’ can be easily confused – we manage a nice chat for a few minutes about former Yugoslavia and cocktails, before I plump up the courage to ask for a phone number. Which she actually gives me.

I head off with a renewed sense of swagger – and faith in the American can-do approach to all aspects of life.

It was only when my director goes back to interview her that we notice a wedding ring on her finger. She’d given me her number out of politeness. You wouldn’t get that in Britain.
