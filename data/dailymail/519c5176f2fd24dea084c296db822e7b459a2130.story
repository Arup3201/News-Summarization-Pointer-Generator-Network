Downton Abbey snubbed, while Call The Midwife only has one nod

Olivia Colman up for acting accolades in Twenty Twelve and The Accused

In it's first year it was nominated in the Best Drama section and in it's second year Dame Maggie Smith won a nomination for best supporting actress.

But this year Downton Abbey has failed to pick up a single nomination at the BAFTA Television Awards.

The lack of acknowledgement for the third series, which received a mix reception at the time, has led to speculation that the fourth series of the stately home drama will be it's last.

No acknowledgment: The latest series of Downton Abbey did not receive any BAFTA nominations for the first time

It is thought that the show, which was one of the most-watched throughout the whole of 2012, has suffered after a number of the key stars have left, including Dan Stevens who played Matthew Crawley.

The news comes as the BBC has overtaken ITV in terms of nominations, receiving five times the amount of the channel on which Downton is aired, with TV film The Girl and crime series The Accused leading the nominations.

The BBC-HBO co-produced movie The Girl, about the tumultuous relationship between director Alfred Hitchcock and actress Tippi Hedren, has received nods in four categories.

Sienna Miller is up for Leading Actress, Toby Jones for Leading Actor and Imelda Staunton for Supporting Actress for her role as Hitchcock's wife Alma.

Crime drama series The Accused is also up for nod, including Leading Actor for Sean Bean, Supporting Actor for Stephen Graham and Supporting Actress for Olivia Colman.

Olivia is up for two accolades, including Female Performance In A Comedy Programme for Twenty Twelve.

BBC comedy series Twenty Twelve has a total of four nods in three categories, with Olivia set to battle co-star Jessica Hynes for Female Performance In A Comedy Programme.

Downton wasn't the only surprise snub, hit BBC series Call The Midwife only had one nod for the Radio Times Audience Award.

However, Downton star Hugh Bonneville has been acknowledged for his performance in Twenty Twelve with a Male Performance In A Comedy Programme nod.

Parade's End is up in two categories, including Leading Actress for Rebecca Hall.
