Gareth Bale has told his Wales colleagues he wants to stay at Real Madrid for at least one more season. But Chelsea are poised to move in.

Indeed, the Madrid hierarchy are ready to accept Bale's £75m buy-out clause back to a Premier League club in order to refurbish their team and keep Cristiano Ronaldo.

Manchester United would love Ronaldo back but, as long predicted by this column, have other priorities in team building this summer with targets such as Mats Hummels, Paul Pogba and Dani Alves.

It could then be that Bale becomes a battle between Chelsea and Manchester City with the Blues in pole position given FFP rules.

Arsenal, meanwhile, aspire to sign Germany international Marco Reus but Real Madrid are likely to win that battle.

Sam Allaradyce could become the new Republic of Ireland manager next season.

Martin O'Neill goes into Sunday's pivotal Euro qualifier against Poland under pressure.

If it goes the wrong way then Big Sam - on his way out of West Ham - has been identified as a potential new man, Football Grapevine has been told.

I am hearing

While West Ham have cooled on the idea of signing Alex Song, currently on loan from Barcelona, on a permanent basis, they are keen to buy Carl Jenkinson from Arsenal when his loan term expires in the summer.

Arsenal, though, could play hard ball over the fee, wanting perhaps in excess of £10 million.

Meanwhile, Song still harbours hopes of making it to a Champions League club with Manchester City and Liverpool still possibilities.

Liverpool still believe they will sign Danny Ings from Burnley on a Bosman transfer this summer.

But Ings, who has attracted interest at Real Sociedad, also has options with Bundesliga clubs Borussia Monchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund.

I was in the company of Frank Lampard snr (father of ex-Chelsea star Frank Lampard - now of Manchester City but very soon to be New York City) last week at Langan's restaurant in London’s Mayfair for a pre-launch of Bobby Moore: The Documentary.

Some funding remains to be required to get the show on the road; hence the event.

But it would appear the project inspired by broadcaster Matt Lorenzo is on its way, not least because of the support of the Lampards.

'Big Frank' was mentored by Moore as a young West Ham player.

He still reveres the sadly deceased England World Cup winning captain of 1966, who was a football, fashion and style icon of his era.

With one reservation. As some wonderful footage was rolled out Big Frank whispered in my ear: 'Mooro was the guv'nor at most things, but he couldn’t dance.'

There were many people, including ex-pro pundits, who somehow thought Steven Gerrard received an easy ride from the media for his red card  against Manchester United last week for a stamp on Ander Herrera compared to Chelsea striker Diego Costa, who was also given a retrospective ban for a similar incident earlier this season. 

Some went as far to suggest it was more evidence of a conspiracy against Chelsea. Or an anti-foreigner agenda.

The notion that there is unity of opinion in mainstream media is of course nonsense.

But it's true that in general, Gerrard did receive far less of a 'coating' for his nasty act than Costa.

Quite right.

The main reason was that Gerrard was quick to hold his hands up and quickly came out to publicly apologise for his act of madness. Costa, even after video evidence proved his guilt, remained in denial.

Gerrard offered an apology and gained respect with his contrition. Costa did not.

Simple as that really.

As soon as Harry Kane began celebrating his debut England goal after his hurricane entry into international football, the TV cameras flashed to the VIP box and caught FA chairman Greg Dyke beaming with a smug grin then turning to someone in the row behind.

I've no idea exactly what Dyke said. But he was quite entitled to chortle: 'Now that just goes to prove my point.'

Earlier in the week, Dyke announced bold plans to raise the quota of home grown players in 25-man Premier League squads from eight to 12.

He also wants to see a reduction in work permits given to non EU players of 'mediocre' standard.

The Premier League have quickly come out in opposition.

But Dyke's idea is sound.

He argues that there could be a lot more Harry Kanes out there but their chances of breaking through are being blocked by, in some cases, an obsession with overseas players at some clubs.

Dyke argues the Premier League could have more Kanes by raising the quota of homegrown players

Indeed, Kane - after a series of loan spells - looked to be on his way out of Spurs because his route to the first team was blocked. Emmanuel Adebayor, who has long been coasting on the gravy train, was just one player in his way.

Tim Sherwood thought differently and blooded Kane. It took some time for Mauricio Pochettino, Sherwood's successor as Spurs boss, to trust Kane to start in the Premier League but at least he gave him a go. And what a reward.

Sherwood, now in charge at Aston Villa, argues there are many academy graduates up and down the country who, if given a decent run in the team, have the quality and hunger to be top class players. As Kane now looks.

It took a season or so for John Terry to find his feet at Chelsea back in the day.

One wonders though, would Jose Mourinho have the patience with a 19-year-old Terry?

John Terry took a season to find his feet at Chelsea and has made over 650 appearances for the Blues

Take West Ham - they have taken 33-year-old Brazilian Nene, who is effectively past it, for the rest of the season on a free transfer to plug a gap rather than recall promising 20-year-old forward Elliot Lee from his spell at Luton.

Given the Hammers are safe from relegation surely there could be no better time to really find out about the striker - son of Newcastle legend Rob Lee - who made one first-team appearance THREE years ago.

But Sam Allardyce does not have a good track record for bringing young players through.

Those Premier League owners who object to Dyke's plan should take a step back and consider it could make economic sense for them and not just boost the pool for the national team.

After all, how much has Kane saved Spurs.

The way he's going it's hurtling towards £50 million.

Italy have had the upper hand against England over the years, winning eleven, losing eight and drawing six.

On the face of it, a weakened England team look vulnerable and one bookmaker make Italy 6/5 favourites with England 12/5.

A 2-1 Italy win at 8/1 is decent shout.

Harry Kane, who is set to start, is 8/1 to score the first goal.

One of England's best displays against Italy was the 0-0 draw they achieved in Rome in 1997 to qualify for the World Cup. Paul Gascoigne, Paul Ince and Ian Wright were among the England heroes that night. You can get 8/1 on a 0-0 draw. Any draw is 11/5.
