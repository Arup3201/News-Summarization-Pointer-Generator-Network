It seems there’s been a bit of a kerfuffle recently about my half a million pound bar bill, so perhaps I should set the record straight.

Several newspapers and websites ran a story yesterday saying that I spent £488,706.08 on a night out clubbing. Not true, but it is fair to say that the rather stiff bar tab did come as a bit of a shock.

I was out at Morton’s in Mayfair on Saturday night and was having a good time as always. The 2&8 Club downstairs was full with their usual well-heeled and beautiful clientele, and the drinks were reassuringly expensive and well made.

The female bartender was particularly attractive and we chatted as I ordered two Grey Goose sodas with fresh lime, and two shots of Patrone Silver Tequila.

However on this occasion, trying to charm the barmaid was my downfall. She was distracted as she keyed in the bill and what should have been £48 ended up as £488,706.08.

What a charmer: Trying to charm the barmaid was Spennie's downfall. She was distracted as she keyed in the bill and what should have been £48 ended up as £488,706.08, oops!

My heart skipped a beat or two and I was concerned that prices had gone up a bit since I'd last been at the club only a few days before, but it didn’t take Sherlock Holmes to work out the mystery of the six-figure bill.

It was resolved very quickly and we had a good laugh about it, but then I made a schoolboy error of judgement – I tweeted the bill. It was meant to be a joke. Surely no one could seriously think I would drop £500K on a round of drinks. Wrong.

I woke up the next day to over 3,000 retweets, and several people berating me for such an outrageously extravagant waste of money and that I should have donated the money to the Philippines DEC campaign instead of a boozy night out.

Well for once I wholeheartedly agree with my twitter critics.

Typhoon Haiyan has left more than 4,000 dead and half a million people without homes. The DEC campaign is certainly a worthy cause and I am happy to match my night’s drinks bill pound for pound (the real one), and I would ask you to do the same and you can make your donations here.

With what money I have left over from Saturday’s night out I’ve started to think about Christmas and I’m looking to buy gifts for all of my Made in Chelsea chums.

I’m doing most of my shopping online this year, and hopefully this will help get back in their good books…

Binky Felstead is really into her beauty as readers of her DM online blog will know well, and this Guerlain Crazy Paris – ticks two of her favourite boxes, perfume and glitter. Crazy Paris It’s glittery shimmer powder for hair and skin and the black cherry and rose scent is divine. Perfect for party season (£45.90 @ Escentual.com).

Is it inappropriate to buy lingerie for an ex-girlfriend? I hope not. I’m thinking of this rather beautiful Bluebella outfit for Louise Thompson. The Lavinia looks sexy and classy and a woman can never have enough lingerie. (£43 at Bluebella.com), and also this Gigi basque is gorgeous as well (£38 @ Bluebella.com).

Lucky Lucy: Spencer is planning on buying Miss Watson these kinky handcuffs (R)

Jewellery is a big part of Rosie Fortescue’s life and she even has her own Dreamy range out, so I need to come up with something rather clever – and this Marc Jacobs Honey Solid Perfume Necklace is jewellery with fragrance all in one – is a double whammy. Its charm resembles a golden butterfly with black striped wings, which twists open to reveal the Honey solid perfume. It smells as delightful as it looks (£28.90 at Escentual.com).

Yet again last night Jamie was channeling a Boris Johnson Junior coiffure, so perhaps he will benefit from this Tigi Bed Head Headrush. And it’s a snip at £7.95 at Escentual.com

Stevie Johnson is one the nicest guys I know but he needs a bit of a re-brand for the party season to get him to snare the right girl. So he’s getting the Clarins Men Grooming Essentials Gift Set (£38 at Escentual.com)

Fashion faux pas: I need to Andy Jordan a a new shooting jacket - I would advise this classic waxed Barbour Steve McQueen Collection Baker Jacket, says on-trend Spencer

Andy Jordan made a slightly unusual choice of attire at our day out shooting clays on last night’s MIC show so I think I need to buy him a new shooting jacket – I would advise this classic waxed Barbour Steve McQueen Collection Baker Jacket (£299 at The Highland Store).

Finally I’m giving Lucy Watson some 50 Shades of Grey handcuffs (£14.99 @ Lovehoney.co.uk).

And if she behaves herself in 2014, I’ll send her the key as well.

Happy Christmas shopping, all the best, Spencer xx
