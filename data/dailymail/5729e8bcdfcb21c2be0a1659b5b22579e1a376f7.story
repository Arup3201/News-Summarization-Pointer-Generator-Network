With her fierce attitude, quirky dress sense and bold beauty look, it's no surprise women wouldn't mind being a bit like Jessie J.

In fact, the singer has been voted the female celebrity British ladies would most like to emulate, and her wide-eyed confidence the trait we would relish above all others.

The majority of British women want to exude a look of confidence over any other characteristic, including appearing sexy, intelligent, glamorous, feminine or youthful. And The Voice judge pulls this off to perfection.

Bold and beautiful: Jessie J has been voted the nation's idol, with a third of women wanting to emulate her confidence and bold beauty look

The desire to look 
confident was supported by 70 per cent of women and 69 per cent of men, the latter of whom oted a 'confident woman' as being most attractive.

And the moments when women wished to appear most in control include job job interviews, dates and nights out with friends.

However, it wasn't attitude or a quirky hairstyle that made women feel confident - it was a bright and bold make-up look like 25-year-old Jessie.

Unfortunately, 77 per cent of British women admit they don't have the courage to showcase such a look, instead opting for a more natural appearance like the Duchess of Cambridge, whose make-up style 46 per cent of women try to replicate.

Tanned skin was found to 
be the ultimate confidence-boosting make-up fix, closely followed by a 
defined eyebrow, rosy cheeks and red lips.

Icons: Other celebrities who were highly rated were Gwyneth Paltrow, left, for her femininity and Cheryl Cole, right, for her sense of glamour

Other famous females that were highly rated were actress Gwyneth Paltrow for her femininity, singer Cheryl Cole for her sense of glamour, Cara Delevingne's new BFF Rihanna for sexiness, and the Duchess of Cambridge for sophistication.

Confidence (65 per cent) – Jessie J
Femininity (52 per cent) – Gwyneth Paltrow
Glamour (33 per cent) – Cheryl Cole
Sexiness (26 per cent)  – Rihanna
Sophistication (13 per cent) – Duchess of Cambridge

Psychologist Dr Bijal Chheda-Varma, spokesman for QVC shopping channel that carried out the research, said: 'Make-up choice can greatly influence how a woman wants to be perceived by others around her as well as how she feels about her self-confidence.

'Make-up has been used for centuries to help women enhance aspects of their persona and improve their self-esteem in a quick instant manner, yet the study shows how many women don’t have the courage or knowledge of how to create a confident look.'

Jo Lee, QVC's Buying Director for Beauty and Jewellery, added: 'Women love the look of a confident icon but don't have the courage to wear it themselves which is such a shame.

'You don't have to go from neutral to pillar box red lips in one jump, start with a cherry gloss and build up from there.

'Make
it a rule to try something new every month, and before you know it 
you'll be wearing that bold make-up look you've always craved.'
