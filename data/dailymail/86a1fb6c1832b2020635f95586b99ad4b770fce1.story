This is the moment a 13-year-old boy suspected of stabbing a teacher and a schoolgirl was arrested while clutching a box of Lego.

The youngster, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was arrested after an attack at The Chase Technology College in Malvern, Worcestershire, at 8.45am on Monday.

Iosac Nelson, 16, captured the moment the boy was arrested on his camera phone after spotting him on the train as he came home from school.

The boy has now appeared in court charged with 13 offences, including being in possession of five knives, and broke down as he appeared in the dock today.

Following the attack on Monday Police launched a major manhunt, 
involving a helicopter, sniffer dogs and officers armed with stun guns, before finding the boy on a train from Hereford 
to Malvern.

Iosac was travelling back from Hereford Sixth Form College to Malvern Link when he captured the moment the 13-year-old was led away by police officers at Ledbury Railway Station.

He said: 'I got on the train and he was just stood there. I wouldn’t have noticed him if my friend hadn’t messaged me.

'He had a box of Lego in a bag like he had just bought it. I didn’t know what to do. There were officers searching up and down the train and they got him.

'They said his name and he replied and they took him away. There was no massive scene or crowds, it was all very calm.'

The boy appeared before a youth court in Worcester Magistrates' Court today, charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to a man

He is facing  further count of causing actual bodily harm to a girl, and another of threatening a person with a knife.

Iosac said the boy was 'just standing there' as he got on to the train, adding that there were no crowds or screaming people, even as police arrived to arrest him

He is also 
charged with possession of five knives, including four kitchen knives 
with blades between two and seven inches long, and a pocket knife with a
 three inch blade.

The youngster, wearing a grey sweater, broke down in the dock on several occasions throughout today's hearing.

The
 case was adjourned to be heard at the city's crown court on September 
18, with the boy remanded to a local authority-run residential 
children's unit.

Pupils at the school have told how a boy 
burst into their classroom on Monday wearing his own clothes and a scarf
 covering his face, with Rambo-style camouflage paint smeared under his 
eyes.

According to witnesses, a teacher known only as Mr Westwood fought the attacker off with a cardboard folder, before the boy ran into the school hall where he slashed a 13-year-old girl. 

The two victims both received minor injuries but were reported to be back at school on Tuesday.

The headteacher at The Chase Technology College has said the school will be carrying out a debrief to review the process they carried out after the stabbing.

Crime scene: A male teacher, known only as Mr Westwood, was hurt during the attack along with a 13-year-old girl, though both are now back at school

Attack: The boy has appeared in Redditch Magistrates Court charged with 13 offences inlcuding GBH and ABH and will appear before a youth court today

Richard Jacobs said: 'It was a very distressing day for everyone at the school.

'Our thoughts and prayers have been with everyone who was directly involved in the incident and we are relieved that they are able to join us as we return to normal school life.

'Staff were very professional throughout the day and supported students well. Students showed their usual high level of maturity and remained calm at all times.'

Superintendent Mark Travis, of West Mercia Police, added: 'I think the school did an excellent job in the way it reacted in a very professional way considering what was a confused and stressful situation.

'They did the best they could to give information but it clearly takes time. I think parents and pupils conducted themselves with real control.'
