Workers at an animal rescue operation in Oregon were caring for 68 cats on Thursday after the animals were found crammed into a van, many in wretched shape, and another that were five dead.

It took 20 volunteers and three veterinarians to get the petrified animals out of the van after they were found on Sunday in Ontario. 

One of the rescue workers said there were only three litter boxes and that the stench was 'horrifying'.

'It was just a swirling mass of cats around your feet,' Elizabeth Lyon of the Ontario Feral Cats Project said about the discovery on Sunday. 

'Every step I took down that center aisle, I had to wiggle my foot in so I didn't step on somebody.'

Disgusting: An Oregon animal rescue group is caring for 68 cats after they were found in 'a swirling mass' in the pack of van. Many were emaciated, some had lost eyes to infection and five were dead. Police are investigating the 55-year-old woman who owned the van

Scene: This is the van police seized from a 55-year-old Oregon woman after they discovered it was filled with frightened cats

Sick: Many of the poor animals were emaciated and petrified, with some, like this one, missing an eye

Major operation: At least 20 animal rescue volunteers had to be called in to care for the 68 cats

Adorable: The woman cooperating with police is believed to have recently moved to Oregon from Texas, suggesting the cats may have driven across the country with her

The vehicle also held the bodies of five cats that died, the Ontario Argus Observer reported.

Many of the living cats were emaciated.

Some had lost an eye to infection, a few were missing both eyes.

Officers made the disturbing discovery after getting a cat-hoarding complaint.

They have since questioned 55-year-old Cynthia Allen, who has relinquished the van and cooperated with deputies, Malheur County Undersheriff Travis Johnson said.

Johnson said deputies haven't learned much about her background or how she came to have so many cats. 

He said it appeared she had the cats before she left Eastern Oregon for Texas about three months ago. 

However she had recently returned to the area, he said. 

He said reports on the case have been turned over to the district attorney's office, which will determine if charges are filed. 

Allen will likely face charges of Animal Neglect I and II. 

Lyon she didn't want to 'vilify' Allen and noted that 'hoarding is a psychological disease'. 

Allen couldn't be reached for comment.

Help: The animals needed food, water and medication

Emaciated: Many of the dear creatures were sick and in need of attention

Scene: This is the animal rescue operation where the 68 cats are now being cared for

Much-needed help: Elizabeth Lyon, a volunteer for the Ontario Feral Cat Project, checks on a rescued cat during the clean-up phase in Ontario, Oregon, on Wednesday

Disturbing: Some of the cats, like this one, lost their eyes after living in such a small space

At least 20 volunteers and three veterinarians spent two hours getting the frightened animals out of the vehicle

More than 20 volunteers and three veterinarians spent two hours getting the frightened animals out of the vehicle on Tuesday, Lyon said.

It was full of bedding and 32 cat carriers holding shoes and other possessions.

The cats have been treated for parasites and worms. 

One small male was to get surgery for an eye that was swollen out of its socket. 

As of Thursday, all the cats were reported still alive at the building where the rescue operation sheltered them, Johnson said.

Lyon described the cats as stressed and frightened but tame, friendly and sweet. 

Many were spayed or neutered, she said.

The rescue group appealed to the community for donations, and for cages to borrow. 

It promised the cages would be sanitized and disinfected before they are returned, in about a month.

'We'll be showing cats at the stores as soon as they are healthy enough to be shown,' said Lyon.
