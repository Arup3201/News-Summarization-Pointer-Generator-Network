A man is suing after allegedly waking from a colonoscopy medical procedure in women's pink underwear.

Andrew Walls, 32, from the city of Dover, Delaware, claims the underwear was put on him when he was under anesthesia at Delaware Surgery Center in October 2012.

He is now  seeking damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress - in court papers his lawyer states he suffered mental anguish, lost wages and loss of earning capacity.

Mr Walls was an employee of Delaware Surgery Center when he underwent the colonoscopy, reports Delaware Online.

'When the plaintiff recovered from the effects of the anesthesia administered by defendants, he awoke to realize that while he was unconscious pink women's underwear had been placed on his body,' according to the civil damages suit filed in New Castle County Superior Court.

'When the plaintiff initially presented for his colonoscopy he had not been wearing pink women's underwear and at no time did the plaintiff voluntarily, knowingly or intentionally place the pink women's underwear upon himself.'

'The defendant's extreme and outrageous conduct went beyond all possible bounds of decency,' wrote attorney Gary Nitsche in the complaint on behalf of Walls.

His colleagues 'failed to maintain proper policies and procedures for the care of patients with respect to not engaging in extreme and outrageous conduct,' Nitsche's lawsuit continues.

Delaware Surgery director Jennifer Anderson declined to comment Wednesday, stating: 'We just found out about this yesterday afternoon.'

It is not known why Mr Walls was undergoing the colonoscopy or when he left Delaware Surgery Center.
