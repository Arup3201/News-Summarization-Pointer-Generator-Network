The public is in danger of losing confidence in court decisions because judges are too male, white and elitist say leading figures.

Top decision-makers such as Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the former Labour Lord Chancellor and Lord Collins of Mapesbury have all spoken of the need to appoint judges from outside the current elitist, male pool.

Despite attempts to diversify the judicial system, as of last year just 20 per cent of judges were women, which includes one solitary female judge in the Supreme Court – Baroness Hale of Richmond, who was appointed in 2004.

Criticism: Senior figures have said that too many judges are white and male

The figure represents a slight improvement from 1998, when just 10 per cent of judges were women, but senior decision-makers say that this is not nearly good enough.

Lord Falconer is concerned that it may take more than 30 years for the numbers of women judges to reflect society, according to a report in The Times.

Some figures in the profession are worried that training to become a lawyer is so expensive that only the very privileged can afford to do it.

Peter Lodder, QC, the Chairman of the Bar Council, told The Times: ‘There’s a danger that with the cost of university and training for the profession, people from less advantaged backgrounds will not be prepared to take on the debts and the risks of being taken on.’

The House of Lords today launches an inquiry into how judicial appointments are made.
