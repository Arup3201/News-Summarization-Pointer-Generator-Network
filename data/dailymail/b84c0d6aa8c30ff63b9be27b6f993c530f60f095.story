Roberto Martinez has called criticism of Arsene Wenger 'incredible' but is aiming to turn up the pressure on Arsenal's under-scrutiny manager.

While Wenger endured a week to forget in Europe, Martinez and Everton found some form with a 3-1 dismantling of Young Boys Berne setting up a Europa League last 16 clash against Dynamo Kiev.

Monaco's 3-1 victory at The Emirates has put Arsenal on the brink of Champions League elimination and plunged Wenger back into the spotlight but Martinez feels the criticism is baseless.

Even still, he is aiming to give Wenger's detractors more ammunition by leading Everton to what would be just their second Barclays Premier League victory of 2015 on Sunday.

'You see the reaction and you see what Arsene Wenger has done and it is just incredible,' said Martinez. 'The way that he has changed the way we prepare teams in this country is unbelievable.

'He will be one of those managers that you will not appreciate how much you miss him until he has gone. He has got incredible experience. I just don't understand that sort of debate.'

Everton have been progressing smoothly in the Europa League but their form in the Barclays Premier League needs to turn and Romelu Lukaku will have a key role in making that happen.

The Belgian scored five times against Berne over two legs and Steven Naismith said: 'He has got great coaches behind him and the will to improve. He'll definitely do all he can to get at the top.'
