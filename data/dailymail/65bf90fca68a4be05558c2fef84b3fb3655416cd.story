The mother of a 10-month-old girl reported missing last week is preparing for her 'inevitable' arrest as police run out of leads, according to her fiancé's sister.

Crews spent hours on Tuesday emptying and then searching a 36ft well at an abandoned home in the Kansas City, Missouri neighbourhood where baby Lisa Irwin was reported missing, but once again authorities came up empty-handed.

Ashley Irwin, who is the aunt of the missing baby, said Deborah Bradley is getting ready to be taken into custody and charged in connection with her baby's disappearance.

Parents: Police are searching a well a few blocks from the home of Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley

Dozens of officials swarmed the vacant home on Tuesday to search the well

Ms Bradley is engaged to Jeremy Irwin, but is still married to deployed Army member Sean Bradley, Ashley Irwin told ABC News.

Neither parent has been named as a
suspect, but Ms Bradley has said police told her she failed a lie 
detector test. They did not show her paperwork supporting that claim, 
however.

Criticising the investigation, Ashley Irwin told ABC: 'It's what the police do. They don't have any leads so they just have to pin it on somebody.'

Ms Irwin said she thinks the police are spending more time investigating the family rather than looking for viable suspects.

She added that she has no doubt 
that that neither her brother Jeremy Irwin or Ms Bradley has anything to
do with Lisa's disappearance.

'Anybody who spends any time with 
them, you know it's not true - she's genuine - she loves that child. 
It's her baby … she would never anything to hurt her,' she told ABC 
News.

'She doesn't care what happens to 
her, she doesn't care what people say about her, she doesn't care what 
people think about her, all she cares about it getting Lisa home.'

Ms Irwin's comments came as 
authorities searched a drainage ditch behind the parents' home - among 
the more elaborate efforts authorities have made in their search for 
baby Lisa.

Her parents reported her missing 
after her father got home from work about 4am October 4. Deborah Bradley
and Jeremy Irwin said a window on their home had been tampered with, 
and they believe someone abducted their daughter while Bradley and the 
couple's two sons slept nearby.

Police have searched the couple's 
home, nearby wooded areas, an industrial park, landfills and sewers. 
They've checked out more than 300 tips, including at least one report of
suspicions about a couple with a child near Lisa's age.

Authorities said the house that 
stood on the same property had already been condemned, and about an hour
after the search ended, wrecking crews came in, demolished it and 
carted the pieces away in dump trucks. A caller had suggested police 
search the property.

'There was no reason not to search
it,' said Captain Steve Young, spokesman for the Kansas City Police 
Department. 'We did everything we could to check it out, and there was 
nothing there. And we're moving on to the next lead.'

None of their efforts have turned up any clues, and they still have no suspects, they said on Tuesday.

The search of the abandoned 
property came a day after a court ordered Kansas City television 
stations to submit all footage of interviews with the girl's family and 
friends.

Grand jury subpoenas from Clay 
County Circuit Court were sent late on Monday to at least four network 
affiliates in Kansas City, according to their websites. The subpoenas 
asked the television stations to submit 'all footage, including raw 
footage of any interviews or statements given by neighbours, family or 
friends of the family, regarding missing baby, Lisa Irwin.'

The subpoenas, which were 
requested by the Clay County prosecutor's office, ordered at least two 
of the stations to appear with the footage in court on October 18.

Jim Roberts, a spokesman for the 
prosecutor's office, said the subpoenas were needed to prevent 
broadcasters from destroying video they might otherwise discard because 
it could be needed later. The subpoenas were issued by a sitting grand 
jury, not one called specifically for this case.

Bryan McGruder, vice-president for
news at WDAF, said the station would provide all footage it had aired 
about the case. But he said the station would not hand over raw footage 
because workers 'routinely recycle what we use.'

R Michael Cassidy, a professor at 
Boston College Law School, said investigators may want the footage to 
find inconsistencies in the parents' accounts of their daughter's 
disappearance.

'It could mean that they have one 
or both of the parents as suspects, and they are developing evidence of 
everything they said in the past and prior to the arrest,' Cassidy said 
Tuesday. 'To show that someone's story has shifted over time can also be
very damning.

Neighbours said yesterday that 
police have been questioning the parents about a homeless man in his 
twenties, who was seen riding a red bike in the area.

Police also may want the footage 
to review 'the landscape around the house,' shortly after the 
disappearance was reported, Cassidy said.

'It could be that these visuals of the immediate area are important,' he said.
