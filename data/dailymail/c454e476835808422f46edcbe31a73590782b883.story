A father and son have been pictured taking a questionable selfie in front of a man being forcibly restrained by police officers in a notorious Queensland party district.

Bystander Alex Cummings purportedly snapped this image of the dad and young boy posing for the distasteful photograph in Brisbane's Fortitude Valley nightclub strip at the weekend.

'Visit Fortitude Valley with your kids on a Saturday night and you might be lucky enough to take a father-son selfie infront of a dude being forcibly restrained by the cops!' Mr Cummings described the scene on his Facebook page.

Crossing the line? A bystander captured this image of a father and son deliberately posing for a selfie as a man was forcibly restrained by police. 'Only in the Fortitude Valley', one Reddit user quipped.

He added that the man taking the photograph 'tried to snatch the bottle on the ground while the cops were busy.'

The picture is reminiscent of recent viral trends where selfie-takers have snapped inappropriate pictures in front of tragic landmarks such as Auschwitz, or at funerals.

One Brisbane Reddit user described the scene as a 'beautiful father-son moment'.

'Only in the Fortitude Valley on a Saturday night could such a wondrous thing take place'.
