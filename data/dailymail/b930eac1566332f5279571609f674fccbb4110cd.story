Olivia Stanca, pictured with her mother Maria, passed away last night, hours after she was taken off a life support machine

The heartbroken parents of a one-year-old girl who lost a long court battle to keep her on life support announced their 'angel' had passed away last night.

Olivia Stanca, described as a 'little fighter', was born with liver cancer and defied all odds to celebrate her first birthday on Monday.

Parents Maria and George were preparing to oppose Great Ormond Street hospital's decision to withdraw life support.

But last night they bravely accepted her condition was deteriorating and dropped their legal challenge. 

The little girl died shortly after the machine was switched off as the family made their way to the hospital's rooftop garden to spend their last moments peacefully and privately, after pleading to take her outside. 

In a statement on Facebook, they said: 'With the greatest sadness and broken hearts we have to tell you that our baby girl became an angel this evening. 

'Thank you so much for your support. Lots of love from Olivia and us.' 

Mrs Stanca today said: 'Following the decision not to give her blood pressure drugs, our beloved daughter Olivia had no more chances and yesterday at lunch we decided to keep the promises we made to her.

'We always promised her that we will let her go when she wants to go, we promised to hold her and love her and we promised to get her out of the intensive care unit.'

Anne-Marie Irwin, an associate solicitor with law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represented the family, said: 'Following yesterday's court hearings, Olivia died in her parents arms shortly after the family made their way up to the rooftop garden at the hospital.

'This is obviously a very difficult time for them and they now need space to grieve the loss of their daughter who has been bravely fighting for her life for a year.' 

Olivia, whose first birthday was on Monday, beat her cancer after two rounds of chemotherapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

But she suffered several blood infections and recurrent episodes of severe multiple organ failure.   

Mr and Mrs Stanca had pleaded with doctors to be allowed to take her to a park for what would have been the first time.

Fiona Paterson, counsel for the Hospital Trust, told Court of Protection judge Mr Justice Moylan yesterday that it was her mother Maria's wish to take her daughter outside.

The hospital arranged  for the 33-year-old engineering student and her husband George to be alone with Olivia on the hospital's roof garden after medical experts predicted it would be the final hours of her life.

Hospital staff opened the garden to the family so they could enjoy being together in a peaceful setting, but she passed away moments later.

Aside from the two nurses on standby, it was believed to be one of the rare times that Mr and Mrs Stanca have spent time alone with their sick daughter.

The arrangements  were made after they agreed to the withdrawal of her life support.

A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital said: 'Our thoughts are with Olivia's family at this extremely difficult time. We appreciate how hugely distressing the past year has been for them and we are continuing to support them in every way we can.

'Olivia was an extremely ill child with a very complex and unusual combination of conditions. 

'We tried everything we could to strengthen Olivia and give her the best possible chance of survival, having provided her with the maximum level of treatment and 24-hour nursing care on our Intensive Care Unit for the past 12 months. 

'However she reached the point where she was no longer responding to treatment and had been in multiple organ failure for a number of months.

'Olivia was a true fighter, and this was matched by the strength and dedication of her parents. We are so glad they managed to have the private time they needed as a family before she died.' 

Olivia beat cancer after two rounds of chemotherapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital but has had several blood infections and recurrent episodes of severe multiple organ failure.

She was born with a tumour on her adrenal gland which spread to her liver. The chemotherapy has left her underweight and vulnerable to infection.

Distressing choice: Mr and Mrs Stanca were preparing to oppose the hospital's decision to withdraw life support from their 'little fighter'. But last night they dropped their challenge

The hospital trust was due to ask the High Court in London for permission to discontinue a range of treatments, including renal replacement therapy, because doctors did not think it in her best interests to continue treatment.

Mr and Mrs Stanca, from Walthamstow, East London, were planning to oppose the application and ask for everything possible to be done to keep their child alive.

But yesterday Mr Justice Moylan, sitting in the Court of Protection, heard that the couple had accepted Olivia's life was ending and agreed to life support being withdrawn following a rapid deterioration in her condition. 

Fiona Paterson, for the trust, speaking at the hearing yesterday said that Olivia's parents 'now accept an end-of-life plan is necessary'.

She added: 'Maria's dearest wish is to take her daughter to a park and be alone with her and her husband. That's why the roof garden was proposed. She is deteriorating quite rapidly.

'Olivia's life support has been withdrawn save for a portable ventilator and an intravenous infusion of painkiller to keep her relaxed and sedated.

'She will be taken to a roof garden in the hospital with two of the nursing staff who have good relations with the family. The family will be allowed to spend time alone, save for the two nurses.

'It is very likely Olivia will die in the next few hours. If she survives beyond 8pm her family will be in a private room and the nursing staff will give them as much privacy as possible.'

Earlier Mrs Stanca said: 'Olivia is a little fighter. She is a beautiful baby. She loves life, loves to learn, interacts and relishes attention, and while we appreciate she is not well, we just want to give her the best possible chance of survival …and believe that with more time she will recover.

'She is our daughter and we have only just celebrated her first birthday and it is heart-breaking to be in this situation.'

The couple had started an online appeal to raise £550,000 for Olivia to go to a private clinic. By today the appeal had raised just over £52,000.

Solicitor Anne-Marie Irwin, representing the family, said: 'This is clearly a distressing time for Olivia's parents. There are no winners in this situation.

'The courts are charged with making very tough decisions where there are disputes between parents and clinicians over serious life or death medical issues. This is a tragic and incredibly sensitive case.'
