Sally Fitzgibbons admits she is far more at home on a surfboard than on a yacht, unable to enjoy her experience in the Sydney to Hobart race as she spent much of the journey with her head in a bucket.

Although it seems logical that the surfing champion would be well-accustomed to the ocean, the 24-year-old admits her experience on board supermaxi Perpetual LOYAL was less than desirable as she was struck down with debilitating seasickness.

Her face was a shade of green as she stepped off the boat in Rose Bay, confessing that she had struggled to find her sea legs.

The athlete spent the trip in her bunk, 'holding my bucket - everything was coming up,' she told SMH.

'I feel like I've been run over by a boat,' she confessed on Sunday to News Limited.

The 24-year-old was on board the Perpetual LOYAL, which was forced to turn back to Sydney after suffering damage when it 'ran into something'

The vessel sustained damage to its hull and started taking in water and was forced to pull out of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race

'I was originally on deck and going great guns and then — whack — I started to feel it. My head just started spinning on my neck and that was it.,' she told Fox Sports.

The crew on board Perpetual LOYAL were forced to return to Sydney less than 24 hours into the race after it 'hit something', hearing 'a couple of massive thuds' which caused hull damage.

 Wild Oats XI claimed lines honours for a record eighth time, completing the race in two hours, three minutes and six seconds.

The crew motored back to Sydney from the South Coast, off the coast of Eden, and the celebrity crew, including Fitzgibbons, boxer Danny Green and former rugby player Phil Waugh, arrived at Rose Bay Marina on Sunday morning.

Before the race, Fitzgibbons explained how excited she was to be a part of the crew and described her involvement in the race as 'a dream'.

Although she loved the comradery of the crew, the self-confessed competitive athlete vowed to return to finish the race, despite her unexpected and extreme sea sickness.

Bell said he was 'disappointed' the Perpetual LOYAL had to retire, adding: 'We're all gutted.'

He told reporters after docking the yacht seemed to have had 'some sort of collision'.

'It was very a tough call to make [to retire], especially when the crew dug in that first part of the race,' Bell told Channel 9's Today.

'I was so proud of the guys. We just ripped in and really gave it our all.'

The extent and exact location of the damage is yet to be seen.

'It's actually more underneath the boat… suggesting something just under the water line was probably the cause of it,' he said. 

One of the many celebrities on board was Australian champion sailor Tom Slingsby who echoed Bell's disappointment.

'It is disappointing but safety first. It is a dangerous sport and you're dealing with Mother Nature, you're out in the ocean and you can't see land, if things go wrong they can go really wrong.' he told Channel 7's Weekend Sunrise.
