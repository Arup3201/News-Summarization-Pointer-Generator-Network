Well-educated comics are benefitting from the 'Footlights factor' and are scooping up all the top jobs.

That is the view of comedian Bob Mortimer, who says Oxbridge-educated entertainers have a lot more opportunities and questioned why.

He has asked whether comedians who went to Oxbridge really are the funniest and, if they are not, why they get work. He said some of them get the best gigs despite lacking humour.

Oxford graduates include Rowan Atkinson, Dudley Moore and Richard Herring.

Monty Python's Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin also studied at Oxbridge.

Speaking to the Times, Mortimer said comedians who went to the top universities have too much influence in the industry and are given more opportunities than their peers.

'I find it hard to believe that the people who go to Oxbridge are by such a huge percentage the funniest people on Earth. It just doesn't seem right. There's something going on,' he told the paper. 

He said comedians educated at the top universities were also given more 'spin-off' opportunities and documentaries.

The influence of Cambridge Footlights Club, a group of performers at the University of Cambridge, is also felt with most successful comedians appearing in revues. 

The amateur club was formed in 1883 and holds plays pantomimes and shows throughout the year as well as regular 'Smokers' - short sketch shows.

Python Eric Idle, comedian Richard Ayoade and Peep Show's David Mitchell have all been president of the influential club.

Former members have gone on to win Oscars, BAFTAs and have long, successful careers.

Some comedians did make the bigtime without having gone to either Oxford or Cambridge however.

Little Britain comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams studied at Bristol along with Simon Pegg and Marcus Brigstocke.

Vic Reeves studied for an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering before launching his comedy career with Mortimer who attended Sussex and Leicester to study law.
