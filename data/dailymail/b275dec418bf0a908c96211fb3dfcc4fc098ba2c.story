Daniel Ricciardo has set his sights on dethroning Lewis Hamilton this season - as the fastest driver in Top Gear's 'Star in a Reasonably Priced Car' challenge.

Ricciardo is to finally get his chance on the popular BBC2 show, with his attempt at the famous Dunsfold Aerodrome site in Surrey to be screened on February 8.

Hamilton, who clinched his second Formula One world title last year, will take some beating as he is the fastest of all the F1 drivers to have taken to the makeshift circuit, ahead of the likes of Sebastian Vettel, Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell and Rubens Barrichello.

The 30-year-old Mercedes driver set his time two years ago in the car reserved for the F1 stars, a Suzuki Liana. 

Ahead of his crack at Hamilton's time, 25-year-old Australian Ricciardo said: 'It's been a while since I heard people asking 'When are you going to go on Top Gear?', so the time has come.'

Red Bull driver Ricciardo, who won three grands prix last season, added: 'I hope it's cold so the engine is crisp, but I also hope it's dry so I can actually have a good crack.

'We'll see how we go. I believe Lewis has the crown at the moment, so it would be nice to take at least one title off him.'

Ricciardo and fellow Red Bull man Daniil Kvyat appeared at Milton Keynes' SnoZone on Tuesday, for a 'Meet the Drivers' event alongside team principal Christian Horner.

Former driver turned pundit David Coulthard was also present, as the team enjoyed the slopes on skis and sledges.
