Outside Benfica’s Stadium of Light, Eusebio has been engulfed by scarves and shirts.

On his head, someone has placed a golden crown and the bronze figure, frozen mid-shot, has been encased in protective glass.

Eusebio died in January and Portugal mourned, but today in Lisbon, the Champions League final feels as if it might have been designed as the coronation of his natural heir.

‘Cristiano Ronaldo reminds me of Eusebio,’ said none other than Pele. ‘He has the elegance and creativity of the great players.’

The message is clear: Ronaldo posted a picture on Twitter with the message: In the biggest game against our closest rivals, there is only one option

Without 
question, it has been Ronaldo’s year. He has been voted the world’s best
 player,  broken the record for goals scored in a single Champions 
League campaign and set a record for Portugal with 49 goals.

This
 final is momentous — and mouth-watering — for many special reasons. It 
is the first city derby in a European Cup final, Real Madrid are close 
to La Decima and yet standing before them are the unfashionable 
neighbours, led by Diego Simeone.

Atletico are  trying to win this 
trophy for the first time, having just won their first Spanish title for
 18 years.

Atletico
 Madrid midfielder Tiago hailed Simeone as a ‘god’. ‘He arrived and 
changed everything,’ said Tiago, one of four Portuguese likely to play 
in the final. ‘We follow him; if he asks us to jump from the bridge, we 
jump.’

There
 is Carlo Ancelotti seeking his third European title as coach, in charge
 of a third different club, with his  English backroom, and there is 
Gareth Bale, the world’s most expensive footballer stepping into this 
showpiece nine months after leaving Tottenham.

Home comforts: Ronaldo hopes to triumph in Lisbon

There
 is Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and the centre forward they want
 to buy, Diego Costa, although he is doubtful with a hamstring injury.

Sub-plots
 are everywhere and yet all eyes are on Ronaldo as he swaggers back to 
the city where he played for Sporting Lisbon, scoring five goals in 30 
games before being lured to Manchester United.

‘It
 is going to be a very  special game,’ said  Ronaldo. ‘I am playing in 
my country, in my first final with Real Madrid. I’m very happy, very 
excited. It is a legendary stadium for everyone in Portugal and for me. 
It has been a great period.

‘The
 fans realise that. They know we are close to achieving greatness. 
Because of that, they are more enthusiastic. As players, we have to do 
our bit by winning games and they support us home and away.

‘There
 is a feeling of joy, of passion, expectation. The players feel we are 
very close to achieving something very special in football history, in 
Real Madrid history, in the history of all the players. We are one step 
away.’

Local
 support is firmly behind him. As he trained in the stadium last night, 
the young dancers waiting beneath the stands to rehearse for the 
pre-match show could be heard singing his name long and loud.

It
 was a few miles around the ring road, at the opening of Sporting’s 
brand-new Jose Alvalade Stadium in 2003, where the teenage winger from 
Madeira led Manchester United’s defence a merry dance.

Centre of attention: Ronaldo talks to the media ahead of the final

Starting out: Ronaldo began his career at Sporting Lisbon

It’s the toughest and most exclusive double in world football — winning the Champions League and World Cup in the same year.

Since 1992, when the European Cup changed to its current format, only two players have managed it. Christian Karembeu (Real Madrid and France, 1998) and Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid and Brazil, 2002) are the pair who made history, but others can take the first step to joining them when Real face Atletico Madrid on Saturday.

Real’s Marcelo has an excellent chance as he will hope to start at left back for hosts Brazil. Angel di Maria was key to Real’s run to the final and should feature for Argentina this summer. Atletico stars Diego Costa, Koke, Juanfran and David Villa could play a part for holders Spain.

Everyone
 present that night suspected they had seen something special and the  
Portuguese press were keen to ask Sir Alex Ferguson who he liked most 
from this Sporting team.

Fergie
 mumbled that he had always admired veteran striker Joao Pinto and a few
 days later spent £12.8million on Ronaldo. It was good business.

He
 has won the Ballon d’Or and  plundered 16 Champions League goals. ‘We 
need him,’ said boss Ancelotti. ‘He is a very important weapon. His 
statistics are there for all to see.’

He
 passed Alfredo di Stefano as Real’s leading European scorer in the 
quarter-finals and, with 66 Champions League goals, is only five behind 
the  competition’s top scorer Raul. When he fired in No 15 for the 
season, he performed a  special ‘15’ celebration with Bale, which made 
you  wonder if his true inspiration is personal glory or Real’s long 
pursuit of a 10th European crown.

‘It’s
 a special record,’ said Ronaldo, who is expected to be fit. ‘That’s why
 I celebrated like that. Not only on an  individual level but also on a 
 collective level. Real Madrid have proved they are an excellent team 
who deserve to win this trophy.

‘On an individual level, it has gone well. I’ve scored the most goals in this tournament. So I’m happy about that.

‘I’ve evolved a little every year. A  footballer always needs to progress. There are always things to improve.

‘Equalling
 or beating Alfredo di  Stefano’s record gives me real pride. I admire 
him as a person. I have seen videos of him playing. But records are 
there to be broken. Generation after generation, things have to change.

‘I’m
 very happy to become part of Real Madrid’s history. That’s something  
positive. I will try to win this as much as I can for this club, because
 this is  certainly the club I like the most.’
