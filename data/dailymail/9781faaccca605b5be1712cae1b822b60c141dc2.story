Shocking footage has emerged on social media of two young women arguing before one of them throws a punch at the other.

Believed to be taken place outside a shopping mall in Melbourne, one female dressed in a black jacket over a white top and denim jeans can be seen confronting the other woman, who is donning a grey jacket, scarf and black tights.

'Nah don't do s***,' the woman dressed in the black jacket said.

'Done what? Am I meant to stop talking to him? Fine, I'll stop talking to him then - I'll block him off Facebook', the one in the grey jacket responded.

Shocking footage shows two women having a public spat before punches and kicks were throw in Melbourne

They both continue their public spat, which was filmed through a mobile phone camera.

The one in the black jacket warns the other woman that if she goes near the guy, she will 'f*****g hit you.'

'Why would you hit me? What did I ever do wrong to you?' the woman in the grey jacket responded. 

'You're tuning my mate. And you're f*****g  razzing your boyfriend', the one in the black jacket said before the other one responds: 'I'm not razzing him.'

'Oh really?' as she steps closer to the grey jacket woman but  it appears she has had enough and responds: 'oh f*** off' before walking away slowly.

But the black jacket pulls her arm back and said: 'No! Come here b****!'  before taking the first swing at her opponent as she falls to the ground.

She continues kicking the woman in the grey jacket a number of times in the face and then she grabs her opponent's hair but a passerby quickly jumped in and pulled the attacker away.

'Hey! Hey! Get the f*** off her! Get off her you f*****g idiot!' the man yelled as he intervened the brawl and ripped the attacker off the victim as she's squealing on the ground.

It is unclear what followed after the video ended but it seems the brawl ended when the man stepped in.

The video, captioned 'WTF! Girl knocks out girl in Melbourne! SMH' was posted onto Facebook by Brisbane rapper Fortafy on Tuesday morning and has received more than 200,000 views.
