Migrants were driving hundreds of miles to obtain fraudulent passes in the so-called Life in the UK test, a report reveals.

Applicants for British citizenship must pass a multiple choice exam on English history, laws, and public services.

The exam is taken on a computer in supposedly strict conditions.

However, the chief inspector of immigration said that, at one unnamed test centre, evidence of fraud had been unearthed – dealing another hammer blow to the credibility of the system.

Migrants were allowed to take the test, administered by Learn Direct on behalf of the Home Office, at any centre they wanted nationwide.

Officials became suspicious when ‘applicants were travelling significant distances to complete their test at a specific centre’.

Yesterday’s report revealed how ‘investigations concluded that the staff at the centre were colluding with applicants in committing fraud’.

It went on: ‘As a direct result, the booking system was strengthened to give applicants the option of only five centres where they could take the test, based on a postcode check.’

The Home Office has now also introduced new checks to make it harder for applicants to cheat – such as verifying their identity using fingerprints.

This is intended to prevent people sitting the test on behalf of somebody else who speaks no English.

Earlier this year, a Mail investigation revealed how migrants who can speak no English were being secretly waived through a separate ‘secure’ language test in return for just £500.

The scam focused on exam centres which are supposed to test if a person can speak English to at least a basic level – also a requirement of the citizenship process.

Learn Pass Succeed (LPS) - which had four branches in London – was filmed agreeing to sell pass certificates to migrants who did not even bother to attend.
