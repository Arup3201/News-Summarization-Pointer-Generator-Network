The last portrait of Margaret Thatcher, showing her relaxing on a deckchair in the London garden of the Chelsea Pensioners’ Home, is revealed today.

It is a far cry from all previous imposing official paintings of the Iron Lady with her steely blue eyes radiating power.

Here, she is like any other pensioner, frail but at ease, whiling away her last days rereading one of her favourite books, with a comforting blanket draped over the back of the chair in case the sun goes in.

Most poignant of all, it is also the spot where her ashes will be buried, alongside those of her beloved husband, Denis.

The portrait is the sixth of Lady Thatcher by artist Richard Stone, a postman’s son who became her close friend during scores of sittings over more than a decade.

Bizarrely, it led to Thatcher and Stone making a private visit to the gorilla enclosure at Regent’s Park Zoo in London after she became transfixed by one of his other subjects, a 22-stone gorilla.

The former Prime Minister stood in the zoo’s ‘Gorilla Kingdom’ as one of the silverbacks charged the glass screen behind which she was standing, unflinching.

Mr Stone, 61, known for acclaimed portraits of the Queen and Nelson Mandela, described how the ‘in retirement’ portrait of Lady Thatcher came about.

‘I always thought there was a softer, more retiring side to her that was worth recording and whenever I went to see her without my brushes, she would look crestfallen. So we came up with the ‘‘in retirement’’ theme. I thought it would be lovely to paint her outside, in the sun surrounded by flowers.

‘When we mentioned it to her, she said, “Retirement?” in that formidable way of hers. But she soon warmed to the idea.’

The book she is reading is Robert Harris’s biography of her No 10 press secretary, Sir Bernard Ingham. ‘She knew all the stories about her, but liked reading them again,’ said Stone.

The setting of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a retirement and nursing home for ex-British soldiers, the so-called ‘Chelsea Pensioners’, was chosen because Lady Thatcher and husband Denis used to worship in its chapel every Sunday.

In 2009, she established the Margaret Thatcher Infirmary there. A portrait of Lady Thatcher by Michael Noakes hangs in the  125-bed infirmary, which is the hospital’s care home, hospice and GP surgery.

It was through Stone that Lady Thatcher became intrigued by gorillas. He told her how he had spent three years flying back and forth to San Francisco to paint a portrait of Koko, a 42-year-old gorilla who communicates to humans via sign language.

He said: ‘She was absolutely fascinated and it led to us going together on a private visit to the London Zoo’s Gorilla Kingdom early one morning. Lady Thatcher stood at the glass wall, completely unperturbed as a giant silverback hurled itself at the screen. It was remarkable.’

Stone said of his friendship with Lady Thatcher: ‘We used to talk about our upbringing, home cooking, making a Sunday roast last for half the week, the joys of Welsh rarebit, all sorts of things.

‘When I showed her a recipe for Welsh rarebit, she noticed it included beer and said, “I don’t have any beer in the house, would gin do?” When I went to America I brought back a sheet of new stamps with Ronald Reagan on them and gave them to her. She asked to keep them because “he was a very nice man”.

‘We would talk about her favourite shows, South Pacific and Carousel, and I would get her Doris Day videos. She would often sing to me, totally unabashed.’

Stone acted as a go-between for Lady Thatcher and another of his subjects, Nelson Mandela. ‘I would take greetings from her to Mandela, and when I saw him in South Africa, he would ask me to return the compliment.’

Stone’s five previous portraits of Thatcher have raised more than £330,000 for her favourite causes.

His ‘in retirement’ painting is to be auctioned to raise funds for one of her favourite non-political charities, to be decided in the next few weeks.
