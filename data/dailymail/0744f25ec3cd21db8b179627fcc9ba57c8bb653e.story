British agency Mad Dog casting is suing Eleanor McLaughlin, 32, accused of trying to steal a lucrative deal to provide extras for the latest Star Wars film

It is a story set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away where Jedi knights battle an evil empire.

But before even a phaser has been blasted or a lightsabre drawn in the highly anticipated new Star Wars movie, the first battle is expected to take place at the High Court over who will supply the hundreds of stormtroopers and wookies.

And at the centre of the legal fight is 32-year-old Eleanor McLaughlin who is accused of trying to steal a lucrative contract to provide extras for the forthcoming seventh instalment of the sci-fi saga.

British agency Mad Dog Casting is suing her for up to £250,000 after claiming it had entered ‘mature’ negotiations to supply extras for crowd scenes that involve aliens and other creatures last year.

However, it argues McLaughlin, a former employee, quit the firm to set up her own casting agency and also started competing for the £1million contract.

Fears have now been raised that the legal fight could delay the shooting of some of the big crowd scenes for Star Wars: Episode VII.

In legal documents submitted to the High Court, the firm accuses Miss McLaughlin, whose film credits include the latest James Bond movie Skyfall, Pirates of the Caribbean and World War Z starring Brad Pitt, of taking the personal details of thousands of extras from its database.

It adds that through her new company called ‘We Got Pop’, Miss McLaughlin emailed them touting work and took ‘further steps to pursue the Star Wars Episode VII opportunity’. Miss McLaughlin denies the allegations.

Filming has already begun on the movie which will reunite many of the original stars.

Fans were informed that cameras had begun rolling at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire after a photo was posted online by director JJ Abrams’ production company, Bad Robot, with the hashtag £dayone, alongside a photograph of the film’s clapperboard.

British studios and actors have featured prominently in the Star Wars franchise since its first film, A New Hope, was shot at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire in 1977.

Episode VII will become the fifth film in the franchise to be made in the UK which originally starred Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader played by Bristolian David Prowse.

Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher will reunite for the new Star Wars film almost 40 years since the original cast members first appeared on screen together. The trio were pictured in a rehearsal room reading through the script for the seventh instalment of the hit sci-fi saga.

It will feature the return of Hamill, 62, as Luke Skywalker and Fisher, 57, as Princess Leia. Ford, 71, will reprise his role as the buccaneering Han Solo - to the delight of fans.

Directed by Hollywood star JJ Abrams, the £120million movie also features original actors Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew - reuniting to play C-3PO R2-D2 and Chewbacca respectively. The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi.

A picture released last month shows the original cast together with new stars include Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Adam Driver from TV hit Girls.

Abrams said: ‘It is both thrilling and surreal to watch the beloved original cast and these brilliant new performers come together to bring this world to life, once again.’ Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote the The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, will help write the script.

Anthony Daniels, 68, who has played C-3PO in all six films, tweeted to fans last night: ‘Keeping the secret in front of y’all was the hardest act I ever did.’

Mad Dog Casting declined to comment. A spokesman for Miss McLaughin said she would be robustly defending the allegations.

A spokesman for Disney, which is now making the Star Wars franchise, declined to comment about delays in filming.
