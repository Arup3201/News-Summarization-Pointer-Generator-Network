Police have launched a murder investigation after a 35-year-old father of two was stabbed near a restaurant in Northampton.

Jon Casey was stabbed close to the Lazeez restaurant on Barrack Road in Northampton at 5.30pm on Friday. 

Mr Casey collapsed at the scene and was raced to Northampton General Hospital where he was declared dead less than an hour later.

Police said that Mr Casey had suffered stab injuries although his body has been transferred to Leicester, where a Home Office pathologist will complete a post mortem examination to determine the exact cause of death. 

Detective Inspector Mark Brayfield of Northamptonshire Police said that detectives were following a number of lines of inquiry. 

Officers have been searching the area around the crime scene looking for the murder weapon. Several drains have been inspected, with roadside grilles lifted to see if the killer stashed the knife nearby. 

DI Brayfield said: 'This was a brutal and ultimately fatal attack and we would urge anyone in the area at the time and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward.

'We are very keen to know of Mr Casey’s movements in the hours leading up to his death.'

It is understood that the killer ran off after stabbing Mr Casey, leaving him for dead on the side of the street. 

A woman passerby who was taking her seven-year-old son to a martial arts class said she saw Mr Casey lying on the floor and called for an ambulance.

A police spokesman said: 'Detectives have launched a murder investigation following the fatal stabbing of a Northampton man.

'Jon Casey, a 35-year-old father-of-two, from Ecton Brook, Northampton, was found stabbed in Barrack Road, close to the Lazeez restaurant, shortly before 5.30pm on Friday January 16.

'Paramedics transferred Mr Casey to Northampton General Hospital where Mr Casey sadly died of his injuries just before 6.25pm.'
