Any baby that survives a premature birth is considered by their parents to be a miracle. But for Kate and Renato Douse, their daughter is extra special.

For little Maddalena is one of the smallest premature babies ever to survive in the UK - and it's all thanks to a pair of scissors.

Born at just 23 weeks, doctors were unsure whether she would survive, or whether they should try and save her.

Had it not been for a pair of scissors on the scales - bumping up her weight - doctors would not have fought to save the life of premature Maddalena Douse, with parents Kate and Renato

Current ethical guidelines in the UK on the care 
of very premature infants do not suggest providing active care for 
babies born at 22 weeks six days and earlier.

But when they put her on the scales she 
weighed 1lb, the minimum weight for a baby to be considered viable, so they fought to keep her alive.

It was only when she was safely on a ventilator 
that doctors discovered a pair of scissors had been accidentally left on the 
scales and that Maddalena actually only weighed 382g.

Now six months old, she has been discharged from the Royal Sussex Hospital and is expected to 
grow into a healthy child.

Very premature babies born around 24 weeks go to neonatal intensive care units, although their parents often opt for withdrawal of care at some point when the medical outlook for the child worsens.

Babies born before this time struggle because their lungs and other vital organs are not developed enough.

Maddalena's mother Kate, 31, of Lewes, East Sussex, told The Sun: 'We never thought we’d ever bring Maddalena home.

'She
 now weighs 5½lbs and is getting stronger by the day. She’s our little 
miracle and we’re so glad to have her home in time for Christmas.'

She and her husband Renato, a plumber, had already suffered heartache when Maddalena’s twin Isabella died a few weeks after the sisters were born.

Earlier this month, research Medical Research Council (MRC) found that more premature babies born when their 
mothers are just 24 weeks pregnant are surviving - but babies delivered 
earlier rarely live.

Their research appeared to find a cut-off point in terms of chances of survival at 24 weeks - 
the current legal limit for abortion.

But they found no improvement in the proportion of babies born 22-25 weeks who experience serious health problems into childhood

The figures suggest that while rising numbers of babies born very early are being helped to survive, the number of children and adults with long-term disability as a result will also increase.
