A mother-of-three has spoken of her desperation not to have a baby a girl in case she inherits a rare, disfiguring condition.

Vicky Harper, from Northampton, does no exercise - but is constantly asked how often she goes to the gym, even by strangers.

The full-time mother never works out, 
but instead suffers from a rare condition called lipodsytrophy, where 
the fat is stored under the muscles, rather than the other way round.

Affecting
 just 200 people in the UK, Ms Harper claims 
the condition leaves her looking 
like a body builder - and she cannot get medical help until her symptoms 
get worse.

The condition has caused her such misery that when she became pregnant, she was desperate not to have a daughter who may inherit it.

To her relief, she had a baby boy, Isaak, now eight months old. She has two other sons - Oskar, five, and Jake, three.

Ms Harper, 30, said: 'I was desperate not to have a baby girl. My dad also suffers from the disease.

'I have to wear fake hips and two bras when I go on nights out because I want to look more feminine.

'I did have a husband, but we have separated and I don’t think I’ll find anyone else. I’m too self-conscious of the way I look.'

Her father and two aunts also suffer from lipodystrophy, as well as members of the family from previous generations.

The condition cause heart attacks due to the build-up of fat around the heart muscle and also results in high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Ms Harper's father suffered a heart attack aged 50.

Lipodsytrophy is where the fat is stored under the muscles, rather than the other way round.

The condition cause heart attacks due to the build-up of fat around the heart muscle and also results in high blood pressure and high cholesterol. 

Those suffering from it are also at risk of early onset of diabetes, liver problems and heart disease.

Ms Harper said: 'It’s very frustrating because I can’t have treatment until the problem becomes more severe - so until my blood pressure and cholesterol are higher.'

She first noticed she was different from other girls when she was aged just 16.

'I was wearing a bra in the changing rooms for PE and one of the other girls pointed out that I had fat spilling out under the strap, but I was really skinny. Since then it has only got worse.

'Now people stop me in the street or in restaurants to ask where I go to the gym or how often I work out.

'It’s not their fault they don’t know about the condition - they think they’re being nice and complimentary - but it’s really upsetting.'

She takes some comfort in the fact that if her sons do inherit the condition, they will not suffer the same torment she did.

'It's OK for a man to look muscular, but women are supposed to look feminine,' she said.

'If I'd had a girl and she had it I never would have forgiven myself. I know how it feels and I would hated her to have to go through this.'

Professor Fredrik Karpe, professor of metabolic medicine at Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, said: 'There may be many people in the UK suffering from lipodystrophy who just don’t know about it.

'It is a severe disorder that for the person affected is very disfiguring. It’s very traumatic, especially for young women.

'The disease can lead to health problems, such as early onset of diabetes, liver problems and heart disease. It essentially leads to an early death.'
