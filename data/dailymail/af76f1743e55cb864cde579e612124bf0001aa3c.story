Bernice Thompson, 34, cured her hyperhidrosis using new MraDry treatment

Ever experienced that awful feeling of lifting your arms only to realise you're sporting some unwanted dark patches? Even the thought of it is enough to induce a cold sweat.

But for one unfortunate mother, the crippling embarrassment of having visible sweat patches was a daily occurrence. And no amount of deodorant could cure it.

Following the birth of her daughter three and a half years ago, 34-year-old Bernice Thompson from Cardiff was diagnosed with 'unexplained hyperhidrosis', which doctors attributed to hormonal change.

Until the age of 34, Bernice had never 
suffered with sweating. As a nurse, she was constantly running around 
wards, but always managed to control her perspiration with a spritz 
of deodorant.

But following the 
birth of her daughter her sweating became excessive until it reached the point that deodorant was completely ineffective.

'As a nurse, part of my uniform is to 
wear the traditional scrubs. Anyone who suffers with hyperhidrosis will 
tell you that light colours, blues and greys are a no-go, yet I had no 
choice,' she explains.

'I felt completely embarrassed, as the wet patches would show up 
on my scrubs. I was very aware that the patients would look. I felt 
dirty and was always self conscious that I might smell.' 

After her diagnosis, Bernice was left in despair and was desperate to find a cure, but the only option she found was Botox. 'I didn’t know of any other treatment so 
decided to give a try,' she says.

'It was effective short-term but I had to continue going back and spending money because I needed around three sessions a year. It was also very 
painful and I would dread the thought of the next appointment being round the corner.'

Bernice 
continued with the treatment, but was desperate 
for a more permanent solution. Eventually, after two and a half years of enduring Botox, Bernice's online research uncovered MiraDry - a non-invasive and permanent solution
 to hyperhidrosis newly available in the UK.

The treatment, works by delivering precisely controlled electromagnetic energy using a handheld device to kill underarm sweat glands. While the sweat glands are being eliminated through electromagnetic technology, the top layers of the skin are simultaneously cooled and protected.

Dermatologist and founder of the Specialist Skin Clinic, Dr Maria Gonzalez, pioneered the treatment in the UK and explains, 'Miradry works by delivering energy to the underarm sweat glands, whichheats and destroys them eliminating them permanently.'

The procedure usually lasts one hour and
 a second procedure is normally recommended around 3 months later to 
create permanent results.

After talking through the treatment carefully with Dr Gonzalez, Bernice booked 
herself in for the £3,000 treatment.

'When I worked out the cost in terms of having
 a permanent solution to my condition, it seemed like a no-brainer. I 
would ultimately end up saving money in comparison to continuous Botox 
for the rest of my life.

'Plus I could not put a value on the effect it 
would have on my self esteem and confidence.'

'The treatment started with a small numbing injection before the machine head was placed under my armpit and put to work. There was a bit of swelling for a day or so after my treatment, but no pain.'

The real test came when Bernice was due for her next hospital shift on the Monday. 'I was amazed. I wore my scrubs all day but not a drop of sweat could be seen,' she says.

Not only was Bernice able to ditch the deodorant, she also experienced an unexpected but welcome side effect. 'I have also noticed a dramatic reduction in underarm hair,' she explains.

Bernice is due to go back for a follow up treatment in a few weeks but is already feeling underarm confident.
