For Washington state mother Amanda Skorjanc, her 16-month-old son Duke is more than just her beloved child - he is a daily reminder that miracles do happen.

Duke Suddarth was the youngest survivor of the devastating Oso mudslide that killed 43 people in March 2014.

Duke, then only 5 months old, was mere seconds away from death when Good Samaritan Kody Wesson plucked him from the debris as his mother, Amanda, lay helpless nearby with two injured legs after their home was destroyed by the massive mudslide and they were carried 600 feet.

Never forget: On the eve of the first anniversary of the landslide that killed 43, Amanda Skorjanc (second left) looked back on that devastating day 

Ignoring the commands of a state trooper not to enter the devastation, Wesson climbed into the debris field to look for survivors.

When he spotted 22-week-old Duke lying on the ground with his face covered in bruises, he picked him up, wrapped him in his coat and carried him to safety.

Duke was rushed to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle in serious condition, but he made a remarkable recovery and was discharged a month later.

Amid the death and devastation of the natural disaster, Duke's incredible tale of survival gave the people of the region a reason to rejoice in their darkest hour.

Nearly a year after the tragedy, Duke's mother, Amanda Skorjanc, cannot help but smile whenever she sets eyes on her precious boy.

Happy reunion: Three weeks after baby Duke Suddarth was rescued from the brink of death, Arlington firefighter paramedic Marty Ruffner and EMT Jason Brisson were reunited with the young life they helped save

Broken: Skorjanc suffered a broken arm, a broken ankle and a large cut on her foot. To this day, she is in constant pain  

Getting better: Baby Duke, pictured here last April with Arlington firefighter paramedic Marty Ruffner and EMT Jason Brisson, suffered a skull fracture and may have to undergo another surgery 

‘You can’t look at him and not think, ‘How amazing is this little kid!’” Ms Skorjanc told KING5 this week, looking back on her son’s journey.

‘He is a light in something that was so dark and sad in a lot of people's lives… he’s that little bit of hope that everybody had,’ Duke’s mother said 

A total of 43 people died after a massive landslide buried homes and a highway 55 miles northeast of Seattle March 22. Skorjanc and her baby were among the few pulled from the rubble alive.

Amanda Skorjanc says she has been reliving the moment the mudslide hit their community every day anew.

Looking back on that day in March, she remembers holding onto Duke for dear life and vowing to herself that she would not let him go.

When the worst of the landslide was over, the young mother found herself pinned under a pile of debris 600 feet from her ravaged home and suffering from a broken arm, a broken ankle and a large cut on her foot.

Laughing it off: Skorjanc and Duke have been kept busy with countless medical check-ups and physical therapy sessions

Inspiration: Skorjanc says her son gives her the strength to get out of bed in the morning and keep going

Precious life: Skorjanc says when Duke is old enough to learn about the mudslide, she would try to convey to him how special he is

Skorjanc was still cradling baby Duke in her arms, only now he had a fractured skull and was blue and covered in dirt.

Being unable to move due to her injuries, Amanda handed her precious bundle to a passerby, Kody Wesson, who heard her screams from the road and rushed over to help.

Eventually, a helicopter came and airlifted Amanda Skorjanc to a hospital for treatment.

Much has changed since last March: Amanda is now engaged to Duke’s dad; their baby is on the road to recovery, and their community is trying to cope with the trauma one day at a time.

But the young family still acutely feel the after-effects of that terrible day.

'It will always be a part of our lives,' she says.

Skorjanc and Duke have been kept busy with countless medical check-ups and physical therapy sessions. Amanda says she is in constant pain, but her son gives her the strength to get out of bed every morning and keep going.

And Skorjanc believes that Duke had the same effect on their entire town when they needed it most.

The rambunctious 16-month-old with an infectious smile may have to undergo another surgery on his skull, but his other injuries are well on their way to healing.

Skorjanc says when Duke is old enough to learn about the mudslide, she would try to convey to him how special he is.
