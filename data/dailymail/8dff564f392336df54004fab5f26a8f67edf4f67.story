The Premier League is bracing itself for what could be one of the most thrilling top four races ever seen. With Sam Allardyce seemingly ruling West Ham out, it leaves five clubs chasing two remaining Champions League spots, and even then the threat of Europa League or Champions League winners breaking hearts to add further confusion.

So who will seal those top four spots?

Let’s work on the basis that Chelsea and Manchester City will finish in the top two. Of course nothing is guaranteed at this stage, but it would take a brave person to bet against that happening. So let’s look at those below...

It would take a brave man to bet against Chelsea and Manchester City occupying the top two slots come May

SOUTHAMPTON 

They won’t go away will they? Even with key players injured recently they have sustained their challenge. They’ve been unlucky to lose Jay Rodriguez for so long and I’m hoping he comes back as fit and strong as he was before his injury, but two things could prove to be Southampton’s undoing: firstly, Graziano Pelle’s goals are drying up. He’s scored two in 15 Premier League appearances – it had been six in nine before that. The other concern is that Saints have to go to both Chelsea and Manchester City in the run-in.

Graziano Pelle has found goals tough to come by of late, with his last Premier League strike in December

Ronald Koeman has worked wonders on the south coast, with the Dutchman's side currently lying third

MANCHESTER UNITED 

When the long-ball king calls you a long-ball team, he must be listened to. But Allardyce was merely furthering his claims to be the next Real Madrid manager by trying to belittle Louis van Gaal. It won’t fool the intelligent football follower of course. Van Gaal can mix it up, and find a way of getting a result when defeat looks certain. Without ever really hitting the stride for the full 90 minutes in any game this season, Manchester United have somehow worked the way up from seventh place oblivion to the top four, albeit a precarious position there. They host Manchester City then go to Chelsea in back-to-back games in the middle of April before a run of five games to end the season where they face four sides currently in the bottom half of the table. The big clash in that final stretch is at home to Arsenal in the penultimate game, and that could almost be a play-off for a top four place. The big obstacle for United is that they’re struggling to play fluent football, they have a heavy reliance on their goalkeeper, and without Michael Carrick they look less likely to win games.

SPURS 

In the next five weeks Spurs go to Liverpool and Manchester United and those results could well determine whether they make it or not. They have match-winners in Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen who have proven already this season they can deliver in the big games and when under pressure. Their weaknesses are obvious – they’ve combined being the lowest scorers in the current top six with being the side which has conceded most. They give away some silly goals – Danny Rose and Kyle Walker were both at fault for the Arsenal goal on Saturday. There’s nothing stopping Spurs, apart from that unshakeable belief that they simply won’t do it, just like most seasons.

Harry Kane has been a revelation this season, scoring 22 goals in all competitions for a resurgent Spurs

Christian Eriksen has also chimed in with eleven goals as the midfield maestro pulls the strings

ARSENAL 

Weaknesses in this Arsenal side are numerous. Any side that relies on Per Mertesacker is asking for trouble, and when Laurent Koscielny defends like he did at White Hart Lane at the weekend, there is no hope. Hector Bellerin can score a worldy against Aston Villa, but struggles to convince when up against a side playing well. Francis Coquelin, Nacho Monreal, Tomas Rosicky and others are all over-praised by Arsenal fans in the rather embarrassing hope they will convince themselves these players are truly going to be regulars in a side that will push to win the Premier League title. The good news for Gooners is that they always make the top four. With the exception of a trip to Old Trafford in the middle of May all their tougher opponents have to come to the Emirates, and Theo Walcott is back and makes a huge difference to how they play. I expect them to win  fourth, and maybe even challenge for third as well.

LIVERPOOL 

Have they left it too late? They’re not losing games – their last defeat was in the middle of December. Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho picked up knocks against Everton and if either of those two are out for any length of time that could kill off the Reds’ top four dreams. Can Daniel Sturridge handle the pressure of being this season's saviour? Before the round of midweek games Liverpool sit six points behind third-placed Southampton with a far inferior goal difference. Brendan Rodgers’ reliance on youth is admirable, with Jordon Ibe an exciting new addition to the side. But can that youth sustain the quality needed in the big pressure games in the run-in when they go to Southampton, Arsenal and Chelsea? And don’t forget their final game is at Stoke, where they have won only once since Stoke were promoted to the Premier League in 2008.

Raheem Sterling, who has been offered a new Liverpool deal, is central to the club's hopes of a top four finish

Philippe Coutinho is also a key component of Brendan Rodgers' side as they chase the Champions League

It’s a tight contest, and it’s going to be very exciting, but I’m going to go for Arsenal and Manchester United to fill those top four spots.
