Jailed: Anjum Tahir was jailed for two years after admitting a sexual assault on a 22-year-old woman in Manchester

A man delivering leaflets advertising a pizza takeaway has been jailed for two years and faces deportation after he admitted following a woman into a house and sexually assaulting her.

Anjum Tahir ripped off his 22-year-old victim's top and repeatedly tried to kiss her as she attempted to fight him off.

The 39-year-old offered the woman money for sex and exposed himself at the house in the Gorton area of Manchester.

The attack only stopped when the terrified woman's boyfriend returned home.

Tahir, an illegal overstayer of Pakistani nationality, was jailed at Manchester Crown Court and now faces deportation out of the UK.

The court heard that the victim opened the door when she spotted Tahir outside.

When she opened the door, Tahir said: 'You're beautiful you are'.

The woman said 'thanks', and turned her back on Tahir to return to the house, but he followed her inside, closed the door behind him and asked if she was alone.

Tahir grabbed the woman around her waist and tried to pull her towards him, repeatedly trying to kiss her neck.

He rammed his head against hers and tried to kiss her cleavage and lips as she tried to pull away.

Tahir tore off her top, leaving her half-naked and tried to kiss her chest before exposing himself.

The court was told that Tahir ignored the woman's desperate pleas for him to stop and he repeated: 'Look, I offer you pounds, I offer you five pounds.'

When the woman's boyfriend returned home, she fled into a room and Tahir was greeted by her boyfriend who had no idea what had just happened.

Tahir was arrested minutes after the attack as he continued his leafleting. The woman was left 'shaken and distressed' by the assault on the afternoon of June 18 last year.

Philip Dobson, prosecuting, said that Tahir had originally denied the offence to police - claiming he didn't understand 'English ways of doing things' and 'misunderstood' the terrified woman's reaction.

John Broadley, defending, said Tahir was 'anxious to return to Pakistan' and 'genuinely sorry' for what he had done.

As well as his jail term, Tahir was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register.

Judge Michael Leeming said: 'I'm satisfied that your continued presence in the UK is detrimental - consequently I would recommend that you should be deported.

'Sexual assault is one of those offences which varies enormously in its gravity - I take the view that this is a serious example of this sort of offence.'
