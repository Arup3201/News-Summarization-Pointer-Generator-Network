A Florida mom left her two young boys alone at home for hours, tying one to a sliding door with two belts and leaving both in diapers overflowing with their own filth, police charge.

Derek Riley, a driver for the furniture store Rent-a-Center, told cops that he was visiting a customer in Orlando on Tuesday when he noticed two little boys, about 2 and 5, playing by themselves in a fenced-in backyard.

He noticed something stranger about the older of the boys: two belts tied his left ankle up to a sliding glass door. 

'They had him like an animal in there,' Riley told WFTV. 'That was really shocking to me.'

'You know how you would tie your dog to a tree outside?' he added. 'It was like that circumstance a little bit.'

Cops in Orlando say that a mother left her 5-year-old boy tied to this sliding door by his ankle using two leather belts. He was left alone with his brother, about 2, and both were in overflowing diapers when they were rescued

Charged: The mother of the boys, 24-year-old Neftaldry Escarment, was arrested on a child neglect charge

Ryan knocked on the front door but nobody answered.

He called the Orange County Sheriff's Office, whose deputies barged into the front door and found the children by themselves.

The boys reeked of urine, and both were wearing diapers that appeared to not have been changed in some time.

The 5-year-old boy, who was tied to the door, had a raw ankle that indicated he was routinely left like this for hours at a time. He could not reach the bathroom, food or water from where he was.

Deputies say the house looked like a nightmare: there were sharp pieces of metal and full trash bags in the backyard where the children played, as well as greasy pans and unsecured chemicals easily reachable inside the apartment.

The mother — Neftaldry Escarment, 24, of Haiti — arrived while deputies were in the house and told them she was at work.

Investigators checked in with her supposed employer and found out she hadn't worked there for months.

Escarment told authorities that the father, whose name has not been released, was at work at the time and she had no way of reaching him.

She was charged with child neglect and remains at Orange County Jail on $1,000 bond.

The children have been placed in the care of protective services. 

'They shouldn't have kids, simple — they shouldn't,' Riley told WFTV.  'Not everybody should be able to have kids.'

Filthy: Police say that the backyard where the children were kept was covered in sharp objects and trash. The boys also had access to hazardous chemicals inside the house

Good Samaritan: Deliveryman Derek Riley heard the children playing by themselves and called the police when he noticed the parents were not around
