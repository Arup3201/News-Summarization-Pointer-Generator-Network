A group of Commonwealth Games athletes took on a road race with a difference today by going for a ride down one of Scotland's busiest stretches of motorway.

The four members of the Sri Lankan team sparked a police response after they were spotted cycling down the M74.

British triathlete Jonny Brownlee was among those amazed to see the intrepid cyclists riding alongside traffic this morning.

He posted a picture of them dressed in
 their bright kit on Twitter with the message: ‘Just seen the Sri Lankan
 cycling team on the M74. Suppose it is a nice wide road!’

His
 brother Alistair also captured the bizarre sight. ‘The Sri Lankan 
cycling team cruising down the M74, lovely spot for a bike ride,’ he 
tweeted.

The Sri Lankans' 
journey was brought to an end near the exit for Motherwell and Hamilton 
when police intervened and informed them they were breaking the law.

The junction is close to Strathclyde Park, which hosts the triathlon events on Thursday and Sunday.

On the road: Police Scotland confirmed they were called to a report of four cyclists on the M74 at Junction 6

A
 spokesman for the force said: ‘Police attended. Advice and assistance
 was given and the cyclists were advised to get off the road.’

The
 spokesman confirmed they were from the Sri Lankan team and said the 
cycles were loaded on to a team vehicle and they left the area.

A
 similar episode occurred during the Manchester Games in 2002 when two 
Kenya cyclists travelled 17 miles down the M61 before being pulled over 
by police near Bolton.
