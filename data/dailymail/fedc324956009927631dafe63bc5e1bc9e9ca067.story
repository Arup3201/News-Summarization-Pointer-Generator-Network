A woman who was shot by her stepdaughter's ex-boyfriend because she wouldn't let the girl spend time with him has died 

Mary Lou Hutson, 55, died  after a long battle against the injuries she sustained when Preston Pollard, 23, drove 15 hours to her house in Marion County, Florida, early Christmas morning and shot her.

After a month and a half in hospital, Mrs Huston died Thursday. The official cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, the Marion County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online.

Pollard, an Air Force trainee from Venus, Texas, also shot Mrs Hutson's husband Richard, 36, when he stormed into the house after midnight.

Mary Lou Hutson, 55, died after more than a month and a half struggling against gunshot wounds inflicted in an attack by her stepdaughter Rose's estranged boyfriend Preston Pollard, 23

The man's 18-year-old ex-girlfriend Rose Courter managed to run for help after locking her three nieces in a bathroom to keep them safe.

The killer's blue 2002 Honda Civic later careened off the highway and into the wounds after he shot himself in the head when Florida Highway Patrol tried to pull him over going 70mph.

Mrs Hutson initially survived the attack, which killed her husband, and was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery.

She had opened the door but found no one outside, according to detectives.

Pollard was wearing dark clothing and a mask and shot the mother twice after she turned around from speaking to someone inside, the Ocala Star Banner reported. 

Pollard drove more than 1,000 miles from near Fort Worth, Texas, to central Florida before shooting the Mrs Huston and her husband Richard, 36

The shooter is then thought to have entered the house and shot Mr Hutson. 

Pollard's father Stephen said that his son had bought a plane ticket for Ms Courter to come to Texas, and later learned that she could not come, according to WFAA.

He said that his son, who recently completed Air Force basic training, did not own a gun. 

The elder Pollard maintained that his son was driving to see his girlfriend rather than going more than 1,000 miles from near Fort Worth to central Florida to shoot the Hutsons.

Police found a .22 caliber handgun in Pollard's car after his crash. 

Marion County sheriff's officials said that the estranged boyfriend had made threats towards the Hutsons and Ms Courter during the month of December.

Police say they know who shot the Hutsons, but still have follow up to do for the case. 

Police believe that Mrs Huston was shot twice after answering the door and originally not finding anyone there
