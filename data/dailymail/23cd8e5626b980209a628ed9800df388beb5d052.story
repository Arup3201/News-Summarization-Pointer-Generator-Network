A North Carolina town continued its New Year's Even tradition Tuesday night by lowering a live possum from the roof of a convenience store at midnight.

The 20th annual Brasstown possum Drop drew thousands to Clay's Corner convenience store both for the main event and the festivities that lead up to it including music performances and a 'womanless beauty pageant.'

The lowering of the possum came with big fanfare this year as it does every year, but in the days leading up to the event no one was certain if the 2013 drop would go on as planned.

Critter: This possum was caught from the wild and used as the 2013 Possum Drop possum in the annual Brasstown, North Carolina event

5, 4, 3, 2, 1! The eagerly awaited culmination of the event is the lowering of the possum in a box (pictured) from the roof the the town's only gas station

That's because animal rights group PETA the state Wildlife Resources Commission, who issued a permit for the event, in an attempt to halt the tradition.

A PETA lawyer says the lights, noise and crowd of people can wreck the wild-caught possum's nerves and health.

But a Raleigh judge ruled Monday that the unincorporated mountain town's holiday tradition could go on.

Revelers took in a bluegrass performance, watched as antique rifles were fired and rejoiced as men dressed as scantily clad women danced on the main stage.

'Rednecks have a lot of fun, and it don't take a lot of money or things to do. We just do plain old silly, stupid stuff, just Southern things that we do,' said event founder Clay Logan (pictured)

'They're not men in drag, I'll tell you that right now': One of the events held before the Possum Drop each year is a 'womanless beauty pageant'

Just don't get the wrong idea.

'They're not men in drag, I'll tell you that right now,' said event founder Clay Logan.

One of the men sported an exposed midriff that bore the words 'Eat mor possum.'

According to the New York Times, Logan started theÂ  event 20 years ago when someon asked him, 'If New York City can drop a ball, why can't we drop a possum?'

Logan couldn't think of a reason why not and started the tradition, which is still held at the only gas station in town, which Logan owns.

Something for everyone: Other events including the firing of some old rifles and a bluegrass performance

'It's something we've been doing for 20 years,' said Logan. Here, a sign for the town of 250 people and self-described Possum Capital of the World

'They're kinda dropping a possum. It's different from a giant ball in New York,' one observant young girl told WRCB.

While some disparage the event as inhumane, Logan maintains that the alcohol free, family friendly Possum Drop is all in good fun.

'Rednecks have a lot of fun, and it don't take a lot of money or things to do. We just do plain old silly, stupid stuff, just Southern things that we do,' he said.

While this year the possum was lowered in a black box Logan called 'a state specified cage,' previous years have seen it in a clear plexiglass container so it could be easily viewed.

It's one of a number of changes Logan has witnessed since founding the event.

'You know, we're not rednecks anymore, we're Appalachian Americans so we can do other things now than just being silly,' he said.

Once the possum dropped it was set free back into the wild to play dead another day.
