Warren Buffett's cash-laden investment house Berkshire Hathaway announced Thursday the purchase of battery maker Duracell in a $4.7 billion deal with Procter & Gamble.

Rather than pay cash, Berkshire will give P&G $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. 

Berkshire Hathaway said it will pay the US consumer goods giant for Duracell with $4.7 billion of its own P&G shares.

Ahead of that transaction, though, P&G has committed to inject $1.8 billion into Duracell to recapitalize it.

Billionaire Warren Buffett, CEO: P&G will receive shares of its own stock that are currently held by Berkshire Hathaway. Those shares are currently valued at about $4.7 billion

Duracell is one of the world's leading battery brands, acquired by P&G in 2005 as part of its takeover of shaving goods group Gillette.

The company reportedly has 25 percent of the global battery market with $2 billion in annual sales, producing from three factories in the United States, one in Belgium and one in China.

'I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,' Berkshire founder and chief executive Buffett said in a statement.

'Duracell is a leading global brand with top quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.' 

The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.

Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week.

Final deal: Proctor & Gamble will contribute about $1.7 billion to the Duracell business before the deal closes

Buying Duracell is a 'brilliant move,' said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short.

'Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,' Kass added. 'And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.'

Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30.

Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year.

Berkshire's income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. 

Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup.

'I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,' Buffett said in a statement.

Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not.

While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources.

'It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,' Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. 'I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.'  

Last week Berkshire, which maintains a massive portfolio of investments in leading companies from insurer Geico to ketchup maker Heinz and executive jet firm NetJets, reported a $107 million fall in third quarter net profits to $4.62 billion despite a 29 percent rise in operating earnings.

In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G fell 0.7 percent to $88.87.
