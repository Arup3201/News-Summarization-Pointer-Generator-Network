The wife of murdered NSW police officer Bryson Anderson has told a court that she lost 'her best friend’ the day that her husband was killed.

'I've been denied the privilege of growing old with him,' Donna, Detective Inspector Anderson's widow, told the Supreme Court on Monday according to Nine News.

His accused killers, Mitchell and Fiona Barbieri, wept in the dock of the courtroom as Inspector Anderson's family and colleagues described the trauma and heartbreak they had experienced since his violent death on December 6, 2012.

'As hard as the last two years have been for me... Bryson is the one that has been made a victim.'

Inspector Anderson's elder brother, Warwick, told the sentence hearing that it was a nightmare from which he couldn't wake. 

'You should save the tears that you shed in the dock,' he told the Barbieris.

'You will not be forgiven.'

Mitchell, now 21, has pleaded guilty to murder while his mother Fiona, 46, has pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. 

Det Insp Anderson's mother, Shirley, said and her husband had been visiting a relative in hospital when a television story about a police officer being killed was broadcast.

'I was feeling empathy for the family to be receiving the awful, devastating news,' she said.

It was only when her husband Rex Anderson called the station that they discovered it was their son.

'My heart aches for my child, I have lost a beautiful and caring son,' Shirley said in her victim impact statement. 

Having served as a police officer himself for almost 40 years, Rex said he thought he was immune to shocking details.

'But nothing prepared me for when I made that call... The events were the most shattering experience in my entire life,' he said. 

'Even though two years have passed I still at times look at a police officer to see if it's Bryson.'

The hearing continues.
