Some members of the FA board want Roy Hodgson to appear before them to explain England’s horrendous World Cup performance.

The FA confirmed on Wednesday there would be no official inquiry into the shambles but instead a continuous analysis of what went wrong and where to make changes before Euro 2016.

Discussion: Some FA members want Roy Hodgson (left) to explain England's poor World Cup performance

However, 
although the FA directors remain united in support of Hodgson when there
 are no obvious alternatives, some will insist on the England manager 
explaining to them in person just why results in Brazil were so 
disappointing.

This
 is the first sign of discontent within the Wembley high command at how 
events unfolded at the World Cup in Brazil at a time when the FA insist 
that full confidence in Hodgson remains intact.

There
 is also board sympathy for the strategy — advocated by members of the 
FA’s defunct international committee — that England managers’ contracts 
should always run from one major tournament to the next with any 
extension governed by performances.

And
 what is certain is that the FA board’s backing for Hodgson, whose deal 
runs until 2016, would not be so solid if someone like  Liverpool’s 
Brendan Rodgers were available.
