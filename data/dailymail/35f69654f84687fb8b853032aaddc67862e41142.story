Texas's top criminal court has thrown out a law banning 'upskirt' pictures - because it restricts photographers' right to freedom of expression.

The Court of Criminal Appeal struck down part of the anti-'creepshot' statute, which criminalised the taking of surreptitious images in public for the purposes of sexual gratification.

These included revealing photos of women - often called 'upskirting' or 'downblousing' - that were taken without their consent.

Rejecting the law on Wednesday, Judge Sharon Keller claimed it was a violation of federal free-speech rights and a 'paternalistic' intrusion of a person's right to be aroused.

Rejected: Texas's highest criminal court has thrown out a law banning 'upskirt' pictures - because it restricts photographers' right to free speech and is a 'paternalistic' intrusion of a person's right to be aroused

She said that photos - like paintings, films and books - are 'inherently expressive' and therefore protected by the First Amendment, according to the Houston Chronicle.

'The camera is essentially the photographer's pen and paintbrush,' wrote Judge Keller in her opinion.

'A person's purposeful creation of photographs and visual recordings is entitled to the same First Amendment protection as the photographs and visual recordings themselves.'

Under the 8-1 ruling, which supported a previous decision made at the 4th Court of Appeals in San Antonia, Texans could take surreptitious images for arousal or sexual gratification.

Peter Linzer, who teaches constitutional and First Amendment law at the University of Houston, told the newspaper: 'It's hard to see how you could make taking a picture a crime.' 

Case: The Texas Court of Criminal Appeal (pictured) struck down part of the anti-'creepshot' statute, which criminalised the taking of surreptitious images in public for the purposes of sexual gratification

The appeal, which questioned why some free speech can be treated as unlawful behavior while others are not, stemmed from a case involving a man charged with improper photography in 2011.

Ronald Thompson, in his early fifties, was charged with 26 counts of improper photography after taking underwater pictures of children, aged 3-11, dressed in swimsuits at a San Antonio water park.

Prosecutors claimed that the constitutional right to free speech, including taking public photographs, should not be a cover behind which lawbreakers can hide.

But Thompson's attorneys claimed the statute did not distinguish 'upskirt' photography from 'merely photographing a girl in a skirt walking down the street', meaning it could criminalise paparazzi journalists, arts patrons, pep rally attendees and 'even the harmless eccentric'.

Surreptitious: Rejecting the statute, Judge Sharon Keller said that photos - like paintings, films and books - are 'inherently experessive' and therefore protected by the First Amendment

Judge Keller appeared to agree, saying: 'Protecting someone who appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be the sort of "paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant's mind" that the First Amendment was designed to guard against.'

But she added: 'We also keep in mind the Supreme Court’s admonition that the forms of speech that are exempt from 1st Amendment protection are limited, and we should not be quick to recognize new categories of unprotected expression.'

She also admitted that 'upskirt'-type images are intolerable invasions of a person's privacy.

During the past 13 years, at least 151 inappropriate photography cases have been filed in Harris County.

One saw a 12-year-old girl sentenced to a year's probation for surreptitiously taking a photograph of a classmate in a school dressing-room, even though the image did not show nudity and was deleted minutes later.
