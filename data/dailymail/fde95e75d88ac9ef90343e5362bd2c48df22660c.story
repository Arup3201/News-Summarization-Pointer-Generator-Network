A woman exposed by Panorama for abusing residents at the Winterbourne View care home was beaten up by two men in a vigilante attack, a court heard.

Alison Dove, 26, was punched to the ground by Mark Davies and his son Mitchell after venturing outside for the first time after the explosive BBC documentary was aired.

She was one of 11 members of staff recorded by an undercover BBC Panorama team abusing residents at the private hospital in Hambrook, South Gloucestershire.

Dove was filmed squirting shower gel in the face of a mentally disabled woman and has since been jailed for 20 months.

She kept a low profile after the show was aired in May 2011 but ventured out to the pub with a group of family members for the first time in August, Bristol Crown Court heard.

Mark and Mitchell Davies were also at the The Royal Archer pub in Kingswood, Bristol, when trouble flared.

Dove became involved in a row with members of the Davies family when Joanne Davies, Mark's sister, told her 'you should be in prison', it was said.

A row kicked off and Mark, 39, scuffled with Dove's brother Simon, before Mitchell, 20, intervened to help his dad.

Dove waded in to help her brother but was punched in the face, fell to the ground and kicked in the face by both the Davies men, the court was told.

Dove suffered two jaw fractures and chipped teeth, and had to have four metal plates and 16 screws inserted as well as a tooth removed after the ruckus in a Bristol pub.

Mark and Mitchell Davies, of Kingswood, were initially charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm, but the prosecution accepted guilty pleas to the lesser charge of affray.

Dove was jailed for 20 months for her role in the Winterbourne View abuse scandal, after admitting seven charges of ill-treating patients

Mark Davies was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and 150 hours of unpaid work.

His son was handed a nine-month suspended youth custody sentence, plus a supervision order and 100 hours of unpaid work.

Sentencing, Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC, said: 'This was a disgraceful incident, quite disgraceful.

'Quite how it started, quite what roles each of you played, quite what happened outside is not entirely clear to me, but what is clear to me is that you both played a significant part in it.

'I sentence you on the basis that this incident was, essentially, out of character.'

Winterbourne View was closed in the wake of the scandal, with the judge praising the television investigator for stopping what had been ‘systematic abuse’.

Last November, Dove was jailed for 20 
months for her role after 
admitting seven charges of ill-treating patients.

In the Panorama programme, she was heard saying resident Simone Blake 'loved pain', before hitting her, pouring water on her and squirting shower gel at her face.

Along with other staff members, Dove was also filmed holding Miss Blake down as a nurse forced medication into her mouth.

It is believed she has already been released from prison on licence.
