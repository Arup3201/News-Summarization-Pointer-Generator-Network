Brighton are keen on signing former Sunderland goalkeeper Keiren Westwood.

Manchester City have also shown interest in the Republic of Ireland international but Brighton are on the lookout for a new number one and think Westwood fits the bill.

New manager Sami Hyypia 
wants Westwood, who made nine appearances for Sunderland as Vito 
Mannone's understudy, to replace the outgoing Tomasz Kuszczak.

Target: Westwood is in demand with interest from Brighton and Manchester City for the free agent

Meanwhile, Sammy Lee has turned down the role of assistant manager with Brighton to become assistant coach to Ronald Koeman at Southampton instead.

Decider: Westwood would be offered first team football at Brighton after time as understudy at Sunderland
