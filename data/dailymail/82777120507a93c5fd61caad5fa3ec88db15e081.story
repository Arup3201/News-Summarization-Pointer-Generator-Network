Kashy, who has signed a one-song contract with Universal Music, then saw the single soar to the top of the iTunes charts.

The singer, who is still based in the UK, is now planning a return to the country for concerts.

He said: 'I am completely overwhelmed and this whole experience has been a dream come true for me.

'It's weird how life works out. My own story is one of perseverance.

'But it is not until now that I have received any recognition. 

'One minute I'm in studios recording demo after demo and knocking on every door possible, the next I'm flying to Hong Kong and performing to thousands. 

'I had never performed the song in public before and was quite anxious on the flight over but then the adrenalin kicked in and it went so well.'
