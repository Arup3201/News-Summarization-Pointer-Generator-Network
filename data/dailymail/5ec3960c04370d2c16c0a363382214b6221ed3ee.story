Some people like to show their disillusionment with politics by voting with their feet.

Others, however, prefer to do it with their pen - and it can spawn a colourful array of alternative characters for the seat in question.

A supervisor has published a list of all the 'write-in' names that appeared on invalid ballot papers in the November elections for Orange County in Florida.

One of the highest was none other than Mickey Mouse who pulled in 273 'votes' for positions ranging from governor to commissioner of agriculture.

Cartoon capers: Mickey Mouse pulled in nearly 300 invalid votes from people who wrote his name onto the ballot papers of Orange County's November elections in apparent protest against the candidates

Darth Vader (pictured at a polling station in Ukraine in October) also featured in the Orange County vote

A write-in name is invalid if it doesn't match a registered candidate's name exactly for a specific race.

Only two other invalid names received more votes - None of the Above, et al, with 555 and Orange County School Board District 3 candidate Regina Hellinger with 376 votes.

 

Barack Obama 46

Jesus Christ 21 

Megatron/ Optimus Prime 11 

Darth Vader 7 

Kermit the Frog 6

Yo Mama 4 

Wile E Coyote 3 

Kanye West 2 

A Hitler 1

 Pizza 1  

All but one of Hellinger's votes were written in for the position of School Board chair, it was reported by MyNews13. 

Other invalid names included on Orange County's ballot papers included Barack Obama, Bozo the Clown and Kanye West.

Luke Skywalker, Megatron and Optimus Prime from Transformers, Tom Sawyer and Wile E Coyote also featured.

Voters also took the opportunity to offer suggestions about how to fill the seats.

Some of these included: almost literally anyone else, any other crook and can't even choose the lesser evil.
