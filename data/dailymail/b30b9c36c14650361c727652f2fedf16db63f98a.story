Liverpool stars arrived to training on Thursday morning looking glum following their humbling Champions League defeat at the hands of Spanish giants Real Madrid - with Mario Balotelli catching the eye once more as he pulled up in his flash red £240,000 Ferrari.

A Karim Benzema brace and a brilliant strike from Cristiano Ronaldo condemned the Reds to defeat at Anfield, leaving Brendan Rodgers' men third in Group B.

Captain Steven Gerrard led the Liverpool contingent arriving at the Melwood training complex for a warm-down session, followed by Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and the rest of the squad.

But it is Balotelli who will once more catch the headlines after appearing in his brash supercar - before training with a red-and-white striped scarf on.

The Italian caused controversy on Wednesday night when he agreed to swap shirts with Madrid defender Pepe before heading down the tunnel at half-time without registering a shot of note during the first 45 minutes.

Balotelli was then hauled off by  Rodgers at half-time and replaced by Adam Lallana - and his manager has insisted he will 'deal' with the striker for exchanging jerseys so early.

Interestingly, Balotelli's team-mate Henderson has insisted the squad have not discussed the shirt-swapping incident because nobody in the dressing room knew it had happened. 

'It hasn't been discussed in the dressing room,' he explained.

'I don't think anyone knew he had even done it. It's certainly the first I've heard of it.'

Meanwhile, Henderson has also admitted the Reds were taught a footballing lesson by the reigning European champions.

The England midfielder said: 'This Real Madrid team is top class with the best players in the world but that's who you want to be playing against and testing yourself, always trying to improve ourselves as a team.

'That's where we want to get to - to be a top team like Madrid playing at the highest level and I think we can do that.

'The first 20 minutes I felt as though we had a right good go and got in behind them a couple of times.

'We had a couple of half-chances to get a goal and then you never know but we just need to be a bit more ruthless in the final third.

'When you are on top you need to put your chances away.

'Hopefully we can keep improving and work on the things we didn't do quite so well.'

Liverpool travel to the Bernabeu in two weeks' time to face Ronaldo and Co once more but they will go there aiming for victory insists Henderson.

He continued: 'We always believe we can get a result, no matter who we play,' he said.

'We just need to concentrate on winning our games. We've got Madrid away next and we need to go there and hopefully get something.

'After that we then just have to win our games.'
