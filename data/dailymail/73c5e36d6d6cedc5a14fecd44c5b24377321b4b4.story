No matter how highly you rate the catalytic impact of Jurgen Klinsmann on Germany’s international football or the complementary consistence of vision and patience of Joachim Low, it’s essential to view Matthias Sammer’s hungry, aggressive, visionary and ambitious impact while technical director as fundamental.

The cumulative process of their work took a decade to reach fruition and was, admittedly, fuelled by root and branch change across Germany’s club and administrative networks.

Yet from the lowest points of their mannschaft’s decline (Group Stage elimination at Euro 2004) to achieving third and second-place finishes at World Cup 2006 and then Euro 2008, the time lapses were two and four years respectively.

New era: Conte congratulates his players after a successful friendly against World Cup semi-finalists Holland

Shocked: Italy crashed out of the World Cup, along with England, after losing to Costa Rica

The right people, the right talent and the right attitudes can galvanize even a moribund situation. Quickly.

Coincidentally, the two biggest early setbacks the German renaissance suffered were being hammered 4-1 by Italy in March 2006 and then losing an epic World Cup semi-final to the Azzurri in Dortmund later that year.

How time flies. Champions that tournament, the Italians were then first-round, eight-stone weaklings in each of the next two World Cups.

For that reason, they are now in the hands of a man who unites one or two of the qualities of each of those three Germans who, between them, hauled their national team up by the scruff of the neck to produce finishes of: third; second; third equal and first from 2006-2014.

Like ‘Klinsi’, Antonio Conte is quite prepared to swim against the tide in terms of what it feels the entire nation believes or assumes. His drive for reform, rejuvenation is zealous.

Revolution: Matthias Sammer was crucial in driving Germany to change after Euro 2004

Low point: Milan Baros scores to knock Germany out of Euro 2004 in the Group stage

Final chapter: Ten years after their Portuguese disaster Joachim Low had led Germany to the World Cup

Like Low, who used his total admiration for the Spanish football school to draw inspiration for a definitive vision of how Germany should play, the 45-year-old Italian possesses a crystal-clear notion of how he wants the Azzurri to attack, defend, press, use width and to adopt a new level of dedication to winning.

But Conte most resembles Sammer. Not, before you splutter toast crumbs into your Sunday morning cuppa, as a footballer. Ironically enough the German was a Ferrari of a player while the Italian... a humble but redoubtable Volkswagen Beetle.

‘I realised from the start of my Juventus career I’d have to work twice as hard as my team-mates to survive at that club,’ is his candid admission of the technical gap between himself and the majority of Marcelo Lippi’s squad. 

‘But, a coach? I always knew I could become a good coach. It’s my vocation. I’m made to show a direction, to add method, to create a squad. To take decisions.’

What he most shares with Sammer now is a defiant belief that hard work, aggression, cracking the whip to get more out of everyone around him, vision, philosophy and a nuclear level of personal drive can achieve anything.

Literally anything. Prior to Thursday’s 2-0 victory over Guus Hiddink’s Holland in Bari (in front of a remarkable crowd of 50,000) there were signs that Conte was going to apply very literally the advice of one of the two great coaching figures in his illustrious career — Lippi.

The great man counselled him: ‘In the Federation, they really want a guy to shake up the environment — it’s the key task now. 

'All great coaches aim to take over the national team one day and my advice is: “Don’t even change one jot of the attitude which gave you such incredible results at Juve. Be just the same man with the national team as you were with the club”.’

Evidence? Mario Balotelli dropped, Gigi Buffon left on the bench against Holland so that Salvatore ‘my horse is like a member of the family’ Sirigu could keep goal.

More? Pizzas and bread are suddenly banned around the Azzurri training camp, with Conte’s players now being asked to eat six times a day when on national team duty.

Breakfast, mid-training snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack, light dinner then a late-night supper — all aimed at achieving what they term ‘glycemic calm’.

Whether this can positively affect his stars when they only gather with the national team a handful of times per season and then eat either at their own discretion or under club rules the rest of the time is debatable. 

Big call: Conte dropped veteran keeper Gianluigi Buffon for the Holland game on Thursday night

Replacement: Salvator Sirigu was preferred to Buffon on Thursday and could keep his place against Norway

Dropped: Mario Balotelli was not included in Conte's squad and will have to work hard to return for Italy

Motivation: Conte has a philosophy of hard work

Conte knows it but his attitude is: ‘My way is the only way and it will be enforced here. If you don’t like it, don’t turn up.’

It is, already, the hour for young bucks like Alessandro Florenzi, Ciro Immobile, Mattia de Sciglio, Mattia Destro, Simone Zaza and Stephan El Shaarawy to show that this is their era. Starting against Norway on Tuesday.

Some of the Conte impact is already totally evident.

He defines himself thus: ‘Football is an obsession. I get home and put the TV on to watch it. Apart from football, I read. I read stories of great men. Of those who have written pages of history. I need to expand my wealth of knowledge.’

Notwithstanding the fine rhetoric, reaching out for greatness often implies ruthlessness. The end, if successful, is praised. However the means aren’t always regarded as justifiable while being applied.

Klinsmann was derided as a new-age pseudo-Yankee. Low criticised for being too pseudo-Spanish, not ruthlessly German enough. Sammer’s brash, outspoken nature puts hackles up.

Conte quit Juventus after pre- season had just begun. The club were infuriated. There are wounds.

However, there are also underlying themes. He’d previously warned of his feelings on elimination from the Champions League in 2013, saying: ‘Right now, Italian club football isn’t competitive at the top level of Europe. I’m sorry to have to say it but it’s true.

‘People can either face the truth or bury their heads but I’m going to push on and try to change it. Some will try to avoid reality and say that in two or three years then Milan or Napoli or Inter or Juve can win the Champions League. But when was the last time Italian clubs were reaching European finals?

‘What we need is intelligence, clear debate and work, work, work. We need that so players, coaches, experts, media, ex-players, administrators... everyone, unites to try to make our game grow.

‘But, I’m sad, we’ve simply been interested in “polemic” in Italy in recent years. What a referee says or does, who a player is going out with, that type of rubbish. Trivia instead of serious matters. And so nothing gets done.’ Until now.
