Diabolical: Tracey Murfitt, 47, was shocked when hospital security guards threatened to call the police, accusing her of stealing hospital electricity when she plugged her phone in to charge

A patient was threatened with arrest while sitting in a hospital waiting room after security guards claimed charging her phone was tantamount to theft.

Tracey Murfitt, 47, plugged her Samsung Galaxy S4 in to charge at Southend Hospital's A&E department, so she could call a friend to warn them she had been admitted.

But security staff who witnessed Ms Murfitt connecting up her charger threatened to call the police about the matter.

Ms Murfitt, from Leigh in Essex, was left stunned by the heavy-handed threats used by hospital staff.

She said: 'All of a sudden I was approached by security staff telling me they were going to call the police for stealing hospital electricity.

'I couldn’t believe it - it was absolutely diabolical.

'They said I could use a hospital phone, but I had to charge my mobile phone to get the number.'

Ms Murfitt was rushed to hospital by ambulance at around 2pm on April 10.

She suffers from diabetic gastroparesis and anemia often leading to extended spells in hospital at short notice.

The chronic illnesses are so severe they have left her unable to work and often lead to uncontrollable bouts of sickness.

The ambulance she arrived in was
 forced to queue at the hospital before she was placed in a  wheelchair 
in a busy waiting room with nurses warning her she could face up to a 
five-hour wait.

During the wait she was violently sick due to her anaemia and became concerned no one knew she had been admitted to hospital.

The
 grandmother-of-two explained: 'I asked the nurse if there was somewhere
 I could plug my phone in to quickly to make a quick call but they said I
 wasn't allowed.

'It was emergency as I needed to let someone know I was at hospital and my daughter was on  holiday so I did it anyway.

'The
 security guard came over and said: "Miss, if you don't unplug the phone
 and turn it off you could be arrested for stealing NHS electricity".

'I thought he was joking as it sounded so ridiculous.

'He carried on though but I ignored him and eventually managed to ring my daughter's mother-in-law.

'She came and picked me up as I just thought I'm not going to sit here after all of that.'

Ms Murfitt's condition worsened overnight and she was readmitted to hospital the next day.

Following a week-long stay in hospital, including blood and iron transfusions, she is now recovering at home.

She said: 'It is very frustrating as all this could have been avoided if I had been admitted immediately.

'My GP had told me I should get an ambulance to hospital and my medical background is in my notes.

'I had been ill all day on the Thursday so I never even noticed my phone battery had died.

'I never realised it was going to cause such a problem at the hospital.'

A spokeswoman for the hospital said: 'We are sorry Ms Murfitt is unhappy with the service she received and we invite her to contact us directly to talk about her concerns.'
