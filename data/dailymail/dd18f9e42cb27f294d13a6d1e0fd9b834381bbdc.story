Two British ex-soldiers who travelled to Syria to fight the Islamic State have told how they want revenge for the execution of aid worker Alan Henning.

James Hughes, 26, and Jamie Read, 24, are helping Kurdish Peshmerga defend the embattled city of Kobane from the terror group.

Speaking from the front line, Mr Read, from Cumbria, said he believed ISIS was 'the biggest threat the world faces' and felt compelled to act even though his family had concerns.

'Killing the aid worker was the final straw,' he said.

Taxi driver Mr Henning, 47, was killed by a masked militant known as Jihadi John in a video released online in October following a string of similarly publicised killings.

'There is no justification for their executions - for putting innocent guys on their knees and doing that, Mr Read told The Sun.

He added: 'My family were nervous and obviously worried about my well-being - we have gone into an unknown world. 

'But I'm a firm believer that if you want to do something you have to do it and not just talk about it.'

Mr Hughes, from Worcestershire, said: 'I wanted to help. The situation in England is getting bad in terms of the support ISIS get. 

'The world needs to open its eyes to the threat they pose.'

Mr Read had a brief stint in the Second Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's regiment, while Mr Hughes served three tours of Afghanistan, the paper said.

The pair hit the headlines last month when it was revealed they had travelled to the war-torn country to join a band of foreign fighters known as the Lions of Rojava.

They were accused of acting as mercenaries, but they insist they are not being paid and are simply involved in a war of 'good against evil'.

Photographs posted on Facebook show the pair on the Syrian front line dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles, posing in bullet-scarred buildings.

On the website of the security firm they founded, Mr Hughes and Mr Read said they were motivated by 'conscience', not money, to travel to the warzone 'to assist innocent people in the face of terror from ISIS'. 

Insisting they were volunteer fighters, not guns for hire, the ex-servicemen said they would 'not do nothing while innocent men, women and children are tortured and murdered by Islamic State while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill'. 

They add: 'This is not a religious war nor is it a racial war, this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity.' 

But Mr Read's mother said she was not happy that her son had travelled to Syrian Kurdistan – known as Rojava – to fight the Islamist extremists.

Speaking from her family home in Carlisle, Wendy Armiger, 43, said: 'He's been in touch to say he's okay, but I don't like the fact that he's gone there. It's his life, but he's my son.' 

Mr Hughes, from Malvern, Worcestershire, said he had served in the infantry for five years, including three tours of Afghanistan, before leaving earlier this year.

Mr Read, who lives in Newmains, North Lanarkshire, said in an online CV that he had been in the Army for three years, specialising in reconnaissance, before leaving in 2010 to work for private security companies.

In August, the friends set up the Pathfinder Group Terrorism & Conflict Research Center, a security company with the intention of providing 'specialist intelligence and surveillance services', and building up detailed information about terror groups. 

The firm's motto is: 'We will go where the rest fear to go'.

On Facebook, Mr Read describes how he had been involved in a fierce clash with ISIS jihadists.

British taxi driver Alan Henning was kidnapped last Boxing Day while delviering aid for a local charity 

He wrote that the 's*** hit the fan', prompting Jordan Matson, 28, a US veteran wounded fighting with the Kurds who is understood to have recruited the Britons, to reply: 'It's always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head.'

Graham Penrose, a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families, said: 'They are not being paid. They are not participating for any commercial gain.'  

On the other side of the battle lines, official figures suggest more than 500 Britons have travelled to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

ISIS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and British aid workers David Haines and Mr Henning.

Footage appearing to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

Security services have also been attempting to uncover the identity of Jihadi John, who appears to speak with a British accent.

The Home Office has warned against travelling to Syria and said anyone who did so was putting themselves in 'considerable danger'.

A spokeswoman said at the time: 'The best way to help the people of these countries is to donate to registered charities that have ongoing relief operations, not by taking part in a conflict overseas, which can be an offence under both criminal and terror laws.

'People who commit, plan and support acts of terror abroad and seek to return to the UK will be prosecuted by the UK authorities. Whether a prosecution for an offence is justified in an individual case is a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide after a full police investigation.'

Last month the Government announced a number of new anti-terror measures designed to combat the risk of IS radicals returning to Britain, including blocking suspected fighters entry to the UK.  

They call themselves the Lions Of Rojava and boast: 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.'

They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists.

Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds.

A photo shared on the Lions of Rojava Facebook page this week showed Joshua Matson (bottom left), Jamie Read (top, second from left), Joshua Bell (bottom right) and Jamie Hughes posing alongside an unidentified man (top, second from right), Briton (top left) and American (top centre)

Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight.

Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora.

In August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance.

But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava. 

Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities.

Last month it was reported that a currently serving British marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave.

The 22-year-old Royal Marine Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups.

Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists.

It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict.

There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance.

Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons.

The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.
