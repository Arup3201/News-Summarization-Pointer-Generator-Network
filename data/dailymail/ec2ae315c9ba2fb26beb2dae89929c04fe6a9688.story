She made a president blush on his birthday and whole nations of men swoon whenever she appeared on screen.

And it seems the charms of Marilyn Monroe have not been muted even 50 years after her death.

America's legendary style icon has been crowned queen of the fuller busts by British lingerie shoppers, successfully beating three of our own well-cleavaged beauties to the top spot.

Perfect curves: Marilyn Monroe beat actresses including Scarlett Johansson, Mad Men's Christina Hendricks and Sophia Loren to the top spot

The actress and singer - who appeared 
in 1950s comedies including Some Like It Hot and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes - was
 closely trailed in the cleavage league table by TV presenter and host 
of This Morning, Holly Willoughby, often lovingly nicknamed Holly Willoughbooby.

British actress and model Liz Hurley came third, followed in fourth place by voluptuous stunner Kelly Brook, who recently designed a New Look clothing line for women with more realistic figures.

Italian septuagenarian and screen Icon Sophia Loren came fifth on the list, with Vicky Christina Barcelona star Scarlett Johansson, Mad Men's favourite redhead Christina Hendricks and singer Beyonce placed sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.

Cleavage queen: Marilyn Monroe is the star with the best bust in town, according to lingerie shoppers

Best of British: Holly 'Willoughbooby' Willoughby was the highest-ranking British woman in the poll

The poll was collated by high street retailer Debenhams in light of the realisation that over half of their female customers wear a bra size DD or higher.

The shop asked 1,000 customers, both male and female - all of whom were shopping in their fuller-bust lingerie range, Gorgeous - which famous female they thought had the best cleavage.

Sharon Webb, Head of Lingerie Buying and
 Design for Debenhams, said: 'If you’ve got it flaunt it, but reveal your 
assets appropriately.

'It’s no surprise that Marilyn was voted number 
one; she clearly wore well fitting bras and never made a boob of 
herself; she knew how much decolletage to bear.

'For most women,
 there is nothing that says fashion disaster like a bra that doesn't fit
 properly and if you’re blessed with a fuller chest and not so keen on 
the beach ball bust trend, then this can be a challenge.'

Out and proud: Actress and model Liz Hurley was placed higher up the poll for best cleavage than screen goddess Sophia Loren and burlesque star Dita Von Teese

Style icon: Fifty years after her death, Marilyn Monroe's curves are still heralded as some of the best in history

1.    Marilyn Monroe

Despite dying of an overdose in 1962, the star of comedies including Some Like It Hot still boasts our all-time favourite bust.

2.    Holly Willoughby

The curvaceous, 31-year-old mother of two has become a household name presenting TV shows Dancing On Ice and This Morning.

3.    Liz Hurley

Gone are the days when she'll squeeze herself into a dress made of safety-pins, but the British model still enjoys flaunting her assets.

4.    Kelly Brook

She's just designed a summer line of clothes for curvy girls in New Look, so it's no wonder fuller-figured females love the sunny model.

5.    Sofia Loren

She's pushing 80, but that doesn't mean the Academy Award-winning actress has lost those killer curves.

6.    Scarlett Johansson

The American actress is just 27 and has one of our favourite figures in showbusiness.

7.    Christina Hendricks

The flame-haired star of Mad Men is best known for her powerfully feminine physique.

8.    Beyonce

Just five months after giving birth to baby Blue Ivy Carter, Mrs Jay-Z has whipped her curves back in line.

9.    Kim Kardashian

The American reality TV star revels in revealing her voluptuous figure.

10.  Dita Von Teese

The glamorous burlesque star certainly has the right occupation for showing off her busty body.

Still got it: Sophia Loren, 77, isn't getting out the polo-necks just yet

Lady in red: American actress Scarlett Johansson secured the poll's sixth spot
