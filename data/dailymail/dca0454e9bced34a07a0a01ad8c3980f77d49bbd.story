Mary Bousted said the start of Shakespeare's plays leave many pupils bored and 'gritting their teeth'

Children should skip the ‘slow’ opening scenes of Shakespeare’s plays and go straight to the ‘dramatic’ parts in the middle, a teaching union leader has said.

Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the start of the Bard’s plays left many pupils bored and ‘gritting their teeth’.

Instead, teachers should give children edited highlights of the best bits of his plays ‘like a film trailer’ to keep them interested, she said.

Her comments were attacked by educational campaigners, who accused her of ‘promoting ignorance’ and dumbing down.

In the Times Education Supplement, Dr Bousted wrote: ‘The trouble with teaching Shakespeare is not the distance between our contemporary use of language and Shakespeare’s Elizabethan English.

‘Nor is it the complex (and often, frankly, ridiculous) plots of his plays. No, the trouble with teaching Shakespeare is that the Bard is given far too much respect. Is it any wonder that so many students grit their teeth, learn the lines and, when the exam is over, remember Shakespeare only as something that had to be endured in pursuit of an exam pass?’

Dr Bousted said Shakespeare’s genius lay in taking ‘mundane, plodding material’ and transforming it into compelling drama.

‘These tricks are used today in soap operas around the world, with their mix of high drama, tragedy and comedy,’ she said.

‘Students will approach Shakespeare more confidently if they are able to make connections between what they already know and the unfamiliar world that they are about to enter.

Mary Bousted suggested children should watch an edited highlights of Shakespeare 'like a film trailer' instead

‘So don’t start at the beginning. Taking inspiration from film trailers, give novice Shakespeare readers a taste of the most highly dramatic scenes in the play.’

Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said Dr Bousted’s position was ‘incredible’ and ‘disturbing’.

He said: ‘I think she’s promoting ignorance and she’s dumbing down. The whole point of studying drama and Shakespeare included is that you understand the whole play, not just parts of it.

‘It’s the computer games mentality that you only have what are seen to be action and excitement but Shakespeare and most dramatists are about far more than that.

But Jacqui O’Hanlon, director of education at the Royal Shakespeare Company, said: ‘We completely agree that the best way to introduce Shakespeare to students is not necessarily to start them with Act I Scene i.

‘Instead, we can ignite their curiosity about the characters and their dilemmas by using a particular moment as a starting point.’
