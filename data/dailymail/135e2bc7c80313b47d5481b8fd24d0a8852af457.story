An Orlando abortion clinic ran by a controversial, unlicensed physician has outraged locals by offering discount abortions.

The Orlando Woman’s Center, which was shut down in June and had all of its equipment seized, has brazenly thrown its doors back open – and even more boldly, it has begun circulating coupons for bargain-basement abortions on Sundays.

The coupons offer a $50 discount for abortions performed on Sundays.

Outrage: A Florida abortion clinic is offering discount abortions

Open since July, it’s not clear when the clinic began the promotion, but it is clear who the clinic is targeting.

‘An abortion center that’s open seven days a week in Florida is giving away coupons to poor women in a crisis pregnancy so they can save money on their abortions,’ said Rachel Burgin, executive director of Florida Right to Life.

Ran by Dr. James Pendergraft, a physician who has had his license revoked five times, according to WFTV, the clinic is open seven days a week and is working with borrowed equipment.

All the equipment was seized in June as part of the proceedings in an unpaid $36million medical malpractice judgement against Pendergraft, according to WFTV.

The most recent license revocation, in April, came after the good doctor performed an illegal third-trimester abortion, according to the station. He maintained he did not know the pregnant woman was in her third trimester.

Pendergraft has also been accused of performing faulty abortions, the station reported.

The scandal-stained doc was able to reopen the clinic because he is not performing any medical procedures, instead delegating that work to six other physicians, he told the station.

In the process of recovering both his equipment and medical license, Pendergraft told the station ‘I've done nothing that I thought was inappropriate, illegal, immoral or wrong.’

The state of Florida, the legions of protestors outside the clinic and the 270,000 people who 'liked' Burgin's post on the pro-life group's website disagree.
