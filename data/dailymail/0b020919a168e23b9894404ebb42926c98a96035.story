'Inevitable': Sir Don McKinnon said New Zealand had been moving to renounce the Royal Family 'for a long time'

Just hours before the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George, a leading New Zealand politician has warned it is ‘inevitable’ the country will become a republic.

Former deputy prime minister Sir Don McKinnon, who was also secretary general of the Commonwealth for eight years, said the country had been moving to renounce the Royal Family ‘for a long time’.

‘There are 54 countries in the Commonwealth, only 16 are realms [where the Queen is head of state], and I can tell you now that one Caribbean publicly, and three Caribbean privately, are probably going to give up the relationship with the monarchy when the Queen dies,’ he said.

‘So it is a diminishing group of countries and the important thing is for us to openly and candidly debate the issue.’

Asked when New Zealand might go down the same road, Sir Don added: ‘I don’t know when… [but] I think it is inevitable. I’m quite certain the royal family understands that completely.’

Prince William, wife Kate and their son, Prince George, were today on a flight heading Down Under to begin a landmark three week tour of both New Zealand and Australia, another country where the republican cause is strong.

The Mail understands that they are travelling First Class, along with George’s new Spanish nanny, Maria Theresa Turrion Burallo, 43, and a fulsome security detail, on a Quantas flight via Dubai. Tickets cost around £6,300 return.

The plane is due to land in Sydney early tomorrow morning, allowing the royal party to transfer to a New Zealand Royal Air Force jet which will transport them for the first leg of their tour.

The bill for all flights associated with the tour is being met by local taxpayers.

While the trip has prompted huge excitement on the other side of the world – with 450 members of the media accredited to cover it - it has not been without the odd hiccup.

First there was a diplomatic falling out with the King of the Maoris who angrily rejected a meeting with the couple when he discovered they could only spare him 90 minutes out of their busy schedule. King Tuheitia accused government officials of treating him like a ‘carnival act’.

Now a row has erupted over a £260 child car seat fitted in Prince George’s official car, according to the New Zealand Herald.

The Max-Cosi Tobi safety seat was installed by Plunket, a charity which provides services and support to parents and young children.

The organisation has organised a meet and greet with other babies of a similar age for Prince George at Government House in Wellington on Wednesday.

At William and Kate’s specific request, the charity last week installed the child seat facing outwards in the royal limo.

In the UK that would be perfectly acceptable as government guidelines state that babies and infants only need to be carried in rear-facing seats until they can sit up unaided – something eight-month-old George is now able to do - and have exceeded the maximum weight for the seat.

But in New Zealand, Plunket, which is a hugely influential group, is very vocal about its own guidelines which recommend children remain in rear-facing car seats until the age of two.

Rear facing seats significantly reduce the risk of death or injury, protecting the baby’s head, neck and spine.

It even proudly issued photographs of its services technician Aethalia O’Connor fitting George’s car seat and saying: ‘If it can’t be installed correctly we need to work out a way we can make it correct. We need to make sure the baby is safe.’

Response to the photograph was immediate with hundreds of parents going online to complain about double standards.

Helen Lawrence said on the Plunket Facebook page: ‘They [William and Kate] have made an irresponsible decision about facing their baby forwards in the car. ‘

Michelle Green added: ‘You went against everything you recommended, undoing all your hard work regarding rear facing until two.’ Last night, however, the society was unapologetic.

Chief executive Jenny Prince said Plunket's role was ‘to provide advice and work in partnership with parents’ to make informed decisions that worked best for them. ‘

He added: ‘Plunket's priority is to 
ensure car seats are installed by qualified car seat technicians to 
ensure they perform correctly. While Plunket recommend that children 
stay in rear-facing seats until age two, it is not a legal requirement.’

The latest action-packed tour reflects the ‘outdoorsy and sporty’ people that William and Kate are.

There is an eclectic mix of events including a trek around Uluru (Ayers Rock), a fast-boat river ride and meeting some of the All Blacks Rugby World Cup champions.

The couple will also participate in a boat race - on opposing teams.

They will also meet Sir Peter Jackson, maker of the Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.

But the visit also includes more formal events with politicians and military personnel - though there are no black tie occasions.

And no royal tour would be complete without the ceremonial planting of a tree. Kate will also visit children's hospices in each country - continuing her charitable interest in palliative care for youngsters.

In New Zealand the royals will visit Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch among other places. Australian highlights include Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra - but not Melbourne or Perth.

The royal couple will arrive at Wellington Airport in the early hours of tomorrow before receiving a formal welcome from the Governor General of New Zealand Jerry Mateparae at Government House in the capital Wellington.

Rebecca Deacon, Kate's private secretary, Mr Head, three press officers, a tour secretary, an orderly and adviser Sir David Manning will be part of the royal party during the tour.

The royal entourage will also include a hairdresser and a personal assistant.

Plunket
 spokesman Zac Prendergast said he had spoken to Miss O'Connor, and 
stressed that the seat was installed ‘in line with the parents' 
preferences’.

Although the 
three week trip, undertaken on behalf of the Queen, has been more than a
 year in the planning, it has very much been designed with baby George 
in mind, according to aides.

And instead of hawking themselves from city to city, as is customary on overseas royal visits, William and Kate will base their young son in three different ‘hubs’: Wellington, Sydney and Canberra.

The arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see George almost every night – bar a stop-over in Queenstown, New Zealand, and another at Ayers Rock in Australia.

‘It’s a long way to go and [would mean] a long time away from their son,’ the couple’s private secretary, Miguel Head, said earlier this month. ‘The tour has been designed with Prince George’s consideration and comfort in mind.

‘Taking a nine month old on a Royal tour is not a first, but it has not happened in this Royal Family’s context for many, many years so there has been much to think about – as any new parent travelling long distance will recognise.’

Royal aides have warned that George’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no-one knows how he will cope with the long journey and 11-hour time difference.

Sources have told the Mail that the little prince is also teething - as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability.

But he is, generally, a happy little boy say friends of the couple, who is adept to taking everything in his stride – including, hopefully, the large crowds waiting for their first glimpse of the future king.

William's last official trip to New Zealand and Australia was in March 2011, when he visited Christchurch, shortly after it suffered an earthquake, and the Australian states of Queensland and Victoria, which had been hit by floods.

In January 2010 he represented the Queen at the opening of the Supreme Court building in Wellington and also visited Auckland, and during the same trip travelled to Melbourne and Sydney.
