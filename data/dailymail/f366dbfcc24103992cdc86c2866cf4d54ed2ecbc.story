Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Turkey has been forced to file for bankruptcy after only 14 months of operation.

The Jamie's Italian in Istanbul's $2.5billion Zorlu Center Mall was unable to reach targets due to a tough economic climate, it was reported.

A bankruptcy hearing was told the chain, which is the Italian eatery's largest branch abroad in the summer when it can accommodate almost 200 diners on its outdoor terrace, planned to cut staff and put in more capital after experiencing financial difficulties.

The restaurant suffered due to the lower prices offered to compete in the city and a a lower than forecast footfall, the Hurriet Daily News reported. 

A spokesman for Jamie Oliver told MailOnline the restaurant will not be closing.

He said: 'Jamie's Italian Istanbul is trading well but is currently in some negotiations with regards to its operations and it is standard practise to request protection from the Court from its creditors whilst those negotiations are ongoing.'

He added: 'Jamie's Italian is working closely with its Turkish partners to resolve the current situation in Istanbul. 

In the meantime, the Jamie's Italian restaurant brand remains hugely successful across the world. 

'In Australia, the Sydney Jamie's Italian had record numbers of customers through the door in the run up to Christmas while the Perth restaurant still has queues out of the door almost two years after opening.'

The company cited the country's tough economic conditions had been a factor as Turkey's growth fell from 8.8% in 2011 to just 1.7% in the last quarter of 2014.

But Ozgur Altug, chief Turkey economist at BGC Partners, said 'almost all other restaurant and chains are going fine'. 

He added restaurants in Istanbul are a 'lucrative business' and 'this has nothing to do with the economy'.

'Turks do not hesitate to eat out even in tough times.' 

Jamie’s Italian has been rapidly expanding since it was founded in Oxford in 2008 - with more than 30 restaurants worldwide, including Singapore, Dubai and Russia.

Cleared out: The former Recipease store on Western Road, Brighton, was pictured boarded up last year

Early in 2014, all bar one of Oliver's nostalgic Union Jacks restaurants, including the Chiswick branch, pictured, were shut down 

But other business ventures haven't fared as well.  

In October last year, the 39-year-old chef unexpectedly closed two of his cookery class shops - and failed to tell staff until they were abruptly cleared out of the premises during a shift. 

He shut down his Recipease branches in Clapham Junction and Brighton after five years of operation - with a spokesman claiming they were 'focusing energies on their flagship Notting Hill branch'.  

But MailOnline reported that one customer, who called to complain about a cancelled booking, said a despondent former employee temporarily posted to customer services admitted the stores were 'making no money'.

Early in 2014, all bar one of Oliver's nostalgic Union Jacks restaurants were shut down amid financial troubles.

The television chef's company cited a 'challenging climate' as the reason for closures of branches in Holborn, Chiswick and Winchester - with only the branch in Covent Garden remaining open.

An employee from the store claims a woman from head office came into the shop during the day to close the place down without warning
