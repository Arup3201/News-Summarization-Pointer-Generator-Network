Even the most poised professionals have moments that catch them off guard.

Karina Carvalho, news anchor for Queensland ABC1, was surprised during a live cross on Friday night.

The newsreader, who clearly did not expect the cameras to be trained on her at the time, was caught walking back and forth on set, fixing her hair.

ABC1 Queensland news anchor Karina Carvalho did not realise she was live on-air as she paced in front of the camera and eventually left the set altogether

Ms Carvalho, who was appointed to anchor of ABC News Queensland in April last year, was heard muttering to herself: 'Ohâ€¦ I think when I did that something' before strolling off-camera.

The newsreader had another on-air gaffe last December when she went live to air before she was ready.

She was sprung reading over her notes and teasing her off-screen colleagues, saying: 'You would just insert your opinions.'

But when she realised the comment had gone to air she looked shocked, before quickly getting back to the news.
