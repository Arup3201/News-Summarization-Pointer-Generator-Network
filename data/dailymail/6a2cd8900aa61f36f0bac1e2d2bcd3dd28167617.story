The Wales Football Association has been fined £3,900 by UEFA following a pitch invasion by supporters after Gareth Bale’s last gasp winner against Andorra.

Bale fired in a spectacular free-kick late on to secure a 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifier victory over Andorra last month which prompted a selection of the away supporters to storm the pitch.

Chris Coleman’s side are currently top of Euro 2016 qualifying Group B after two wins and a draw in their opening three fixtures.
