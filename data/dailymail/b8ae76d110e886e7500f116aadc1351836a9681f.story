A political adviser was told to 'go f*** himself' when he warned former Senator John Edwards that pursuing an extramarital affair with a videographer would sink his presidential ambitions, it was revealed today.

Peter Scher, who first worked with Edwards when he was the Democrats' 2004 vice presidential nominee, testified at Edwards' campaign finance trial on Friday.

He said the politician denied having a sexual relationship with Rielle Hunter when Scher broached the subject in September 2006.

'I told him if it was true that he was having an affair with Ms Hunter, he should not run for president,' Mr Scher testified as the second week of Edwards' trial neared its end. 'If it was true, eventually it would come out and it would destroy his political career.'

Disillusioned: John Edwards arrives at the federal courthouse today to hear Bunny Mellon's confidant Bryan Huffman testify about how the heiress felt used by him

Confidant: Bryan Huffman, an interior decorator from Monroe, told the court today that Bunny Mellon was 'apoplectic' when Andrew Young asked her for $50m on behalf of Edwards

Mr Scher said he again confronted 
Edwards about the affair in a heated phone call after learning Hunter 
was still traveling with the former senator from North Carolina despite 
staff concerns.

This time, Edwards responded that he didn't need a babysitter and told Scher to back off, the former adviser recalled.

'He told me to go f*** myself,' said Mr Scher, who stopped serving as an outside adviser to Edwards at that point.

Earlier today, a friend of the 
101-year-old heiress whose money helped hide John Edwards' pregnant 
mistress said the presidential candidate should have used his own money 
for the cover up and was 'apoplectic' when asked for $50million towards a
poverty foundation.

Interior designer Bryan Huffman was 
asked on the witness stand today how Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon reacted after
learning what became of some of the $725,000 in secret checks she had 
funneled to a fundraiser for Edwards' 2008 campaign.

Huffman,
48, said that Mellon was not one to judge someone for having an 
extramarital affair. Her relationship with her first husband overlapped 
with that of her second.

But, Huffman said, Mellon had an opinion about how her money was spent.

'She thought maybe you should probably pay for your girlfriend yourself,' Huffman replied.

As the courtroom erupted in laughter, even the former North Carolina senator seated at the defense table cracked a smile.

It was a frequent reaction to testimony from Huffman, the congenial Charlotte designer who described himself as the elderly millionaire's 'evening friend' — someone she calls for a chat before bedtime.

Mellon, who rarely leaves her expansive Virginia estate, is not expected to testify at Edwards' corruption trial. But her money is at the heart of the government's case against Edwards.

Prosecutors allege that he masterminded a scheme to use about $1 million from Mellon and a second wealthy supporter to hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House.

Edwards denies knowing about the money and has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts related to campaign finance violations. If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison.

In addition to the $725,000 at issue in the trial, Mellon gave an additional $6.4 million to organizations supportive of Edwards' presidential bid.

Dogged by tabloid reports about his affair, Edwards was forced to withdraw from the race in January 2008.

In the following months, it also became clear he also wouldn't be the Democratic nominee for vice president, as he had been four years earlier.

According to earlier testimony, Edwards then turned his attention to raising money for a foundation to fight poverty.

Andrew Young, the Edwards aide who helped carry out the cover-up of the mistress and her baby, called Mellon in the summer of 2008 and asked for another $40 to $50 million to endow the foundation.

Young also discussed the feasibility of the donation with Mellon's financial adviser.

Huffman, who had sent Mellon's secret checks to Young, said the heiress reacted angrily to the request, which she believed would have required her to liquidate some of her financial holdings.

'She was rather apoplectic at the size of the figure they requested. She was really upset,' Huffman testified. 'She said, "I cannot believe that the senator really wanted me for my money all along".'

Huffman testified that he called Young and told him Mellon was deeply offended and that Edwards needed to smooth things over.

The former senator apologized to her and said that he didn't know how much money Young had asked for, Huffman said. 

When the interior designer relayed that information to Young, the aide laughed and reiterated that the amount was Edwards' idea.

'He said "Just call me throw-me-under-the-bus-Andrew",' Huffman said.

Huffman also testified that he felt that Young was being truthful.

'Everything he told me had been accurate, so my opinion was that he had told us the truth,' Huffman said.

Bryan Huffman testifying about Andrew Young today

The previous day, Huffman testified that he'd participated in a scheme by Mellon to provide $725,000 in checks for Edwards.

The
checks were written to Huffman with notations such as 'Antique 
Charleston Table' in the memo line, and Huffman would endorse them and 
pass them along to Young.

The
ruse was intended to throw off money managers for the Mellon family by 
making it appear they were engaged in a furniture business.

The elderly heiress whose money and 
how it was spent is the main focus of the John Edwards trial had a huge 
crush on him and would be 'euphoric' whenever the former senator was 
around, a friend testified.

Jealous? Huffman said yesterday Bunny hated Elizabeth and would never allow her to come to her estate with Edwards

He also reiterated what other witnesses said about the now 101-year-old millionaire: 'She liked how he looked, what he espoused and what good he could do for the country.'

She first met Edwards in 2004 and was said to have been in love with him ever since.

The 48-year-old recounted what Bunny said after a December 2005 meeting with Edwards at her 4,000-acre estate: 'There goes the next president of the United States.'

He testified that she was more than happy to pay for personal expenses for Edwards after the controversy about his expensive haircut in 2007.

'The campaign gave [Mellon] a wonderful focus and something to hold on to,' Mr Huffman said. Every phone call from Edwards 'always made her extremely happy'.

'She was having fun with this,' he added.

But there was one thing clear about Edwards' visits to her sprawling estate - he was not allowed to bring his wife Elizabeth, who Mr Huffman said she hated.

'Unless Mrs Edwards could come then Mr Edwards couldn’t come,' Huffman recalled.

The now blind and reclusive Bunny told Newsweek in an interview last year: 'John had a hard time with Elizabeth.'

Her lawyer Alex Forger added his client 'was not enamored of his wife and didn’t want his wife to know that he was getting money.'

Mellon's personal lawyer, Alex Forger, is expected to take the stand Friday afternoon.
