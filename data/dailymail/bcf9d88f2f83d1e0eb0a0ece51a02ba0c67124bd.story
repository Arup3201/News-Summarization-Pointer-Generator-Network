Hundreds of ethnic Kurds have turned out for the burial of three brave resistance fighters who died battling militants from the Islamic State in Kobane.

The funerals of two men and a woman barely out her teens were held in the Turkish village of Suruc, within clear sight of the Kurdish fighters' besieged hometown over the border in Syria.

The three Kurdish fighters were members of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and died in fierce clashes in Kobane, which has been under assault by ISIS extremists since mid-September.

ISIS still surrounds the town and holds parts of it despite being forced to retreat in recent days by the brave Kurdish resistance and sustained airstrikes by a coalition of American and Arab warplanes.

Burial: The funerals of two men and a woman barely out her teens were held in the Turkish village of Suruc, within clear sight of the Kurdish fighters' besieged hometown over the border in Syria 

Clashes: The three Kurdish fighters were members of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and died in fierce clashes in Kobane, which has been under assault by ISIS extremists since mid-September

The graves of 20-year-old Hanim Dabaan 30-year-old Idris Ahmad and 25-year-old Mohammed Mustafa are pictured in Suruc

With her family absent, the Kurdish flag-draped coffin bearing the body of 20-year-old Hanim Dabaan was carried to her grave yesterday by women who didn't know her but wanted to show their support.

30-year-old Idris Ahmad and 25-year-old Mohammed Mustafa were laid to rest beside her, also carried by volunteers.

In the chaos of Syria's multifaceted war, with a multitude of groups fighting each other as well as President Bashar al-Assad's forces, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and it is not always possible to locate the families of those killed in fighting. 

Turkey alone has seen an estimated 1.6 million refugees cross its borders in the four years of the Syrian war, according to UN officials.

Tragic: With her family absent, the Kurdish flag-draped coffin bearing the body of 20-year-old Hanim Dabaan was carried to her grave yesterday by people who didn't know her but wanted to show their support

Bereaved: It isn't clear where the families of Dabaan, Ahmad and Mustafa were - or even whether they knew their loved ones were dead

At one point a rumor rippled through the crowd that the young woman's parents were on their way. But if they were, they never made it

'Our house has been demolished in Kobane and we are living in tents. ... At least we can support our martyrs and we will accompany them to their graves,' said Fatma Muslim, one of dozens of women who turned up at the Suruc hospital morgue for the funeral procession to the nearby cemetery. 

It was volunteers - rather than family members, as is the Islamic tradition - who helped wash and shroud the fighters' bodies in preparation for burial. 

'There is nobody to wash them,' said Akeed Hamad, 21, who came to the morgue with a friend and offered to help. 'There is only one doctor who can wash them, and the rest are volunteers.'

It wasn't immediately clear where the families of Dabaan, Ahmad and Mustafa were - or even whether they knew their loved ones were dead.

Peace: Hundreds of ethnic Kurds turned out for the burial of the three brave resistance fighters who died fighting ISIS in Kobane

Strangers: Out of about 30 graves in the section of Suruc cemetery given over to Kurds who died fighting in Kobane, only five of them have known families. Nonetheless ethnic Kurds supportive of the battle against the Islamic State mourn for those they did not know

At one point a rumor rippled through the crowd that the young woman's parents were on their way. But if they were, they never made it.

Yet in Suruc's cemetery, in a part set aside for Syrian Kurds killed across the border, they are not the only ones buried without their relatives.

Out of about 30 graves there so far, only five of them have known families, said Wahida Kushta, one of the volunteers who helped prepare Dabaan's body for burial. 

'I do it to help. Let's support them now at least.'
