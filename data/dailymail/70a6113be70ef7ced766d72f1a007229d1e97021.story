Meet the street artist who is quite literally bringing a smile to the streets of Russia.

Nikita Nomerz's unique quirky faces are causing quite a stir in the cities of the former grey, concrete-clad Communist heartland.

His exhibition, entitled The Living Wall, features a variety of different faces sprayed on to the sides of derelict buildings.

Face-off: Russian street artist Nikita Nomerz creates cool street
art by painting faces on derelict structures, incorporating some of the architectural
elements into his work. This piece is entitled: The Faces

Nomerz
has travelled around various cities in Russia, including Irkutsk, Perm and of course his home city of Nizhniy Novgorod, to create the eye-catching works of art.

After finding a suitable abandoned structure, the artist attempts to bring it back to life.

By adding eyes and facial 
features he makes old buildings laugh, smile, scream or just look at the
passersby with an eerie gaze.

From laughing water towers to grinning walls with lights for eyes, Nomerz has brightened up dilapidated corners of Russia with his signature faces.

Brick canvas: Nomerz adds faces to manmade objects. 'The Fire in the Eyes' in Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia, shows two small windows containing flames

Eye catching: This imaginative piece of work called 'The Eyes of the City' is another exhibit in the Living Wall Graffiti series

High art: 'Big Brother', the street artist has made structures come 
alive by adding eyes and facial features in cities across Russia

Innovative: 'Underground Dweller', this piece features a set of teeth made from spray cans

Shy: Nomerz hides behind a spray can, the tool 
of his tratde. While right the piece entitled 'Just Smile' illustrates 
how he makes use of the features in the walls to create his faces

He began his love affair with art by developing his skills as a classic hip hop graffiti artist but he later began to experiment.

On his blog site the artist says he likes to 
play with space and objects and is inspired by the place itself.

He says he usually doesnâ€™t spend much time creating a work and sometimes finishes a piece in less than an hour. But he says it all 
depends on the size of the object and his ideas.

Square eyes: 'Open Your Eyes'. Nomerz has travelled across various cities in his native Russia brightening up derelict corners with his signature faces

Highlights: 'Summertime in Vyksa', Nomerz said he started in school with classic hip hop graffiti but became more interested in street art

Art attack: 'Riverman', Nomerz is inspired by the place itself. He says 
he loves watching the city and finding an interesting point

The eyes have it: 'Watcher Man', Nomerz says he rejects being labelled as an underground artist

Face painting: 'Toothyman', Nomerz says it would be nice if people started paying more attention to what was around them

Striking: 'The Tower Man in Perm',
Nikita Nomerz's work ranges from water towers painted to look like they're laughing to dilapidated buildings with broken window frames for eyes
