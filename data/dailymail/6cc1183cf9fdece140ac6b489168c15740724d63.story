A note written by Robert Durst, scion of one of New York's largest real estate empires, may hold the key to the murder of his neighbor.

Durst, a billionaire, was questioned but not charged in the mysterious death of his first wife Kathleen McCormack in 1982.

The 71-year-old was then questioned in 2000 after the death of his longtime friend and elderly neighbor Susan Berman, shortly before she was to be questioned if she knew about Kathleen's disappearance.

Police have long suspected that Durst was the author of an anonymous note sent to the Beverly Hills Police Department alerting them to a body at Susan Berman's home, reports AOL.

The note read 'BEVERLEY HILLS POLICE - 1527 BENEDICT CANYON CADAVER' - it has distinctive block capital lettering and the word Beverly Hills is misspelled.

Now a documentary producer has been shown a letter Durst wrote in 1999 to Berman. 

The handwriting appears to be similar to the note sent to police and again Beverly Hills is misspelled on both notes.

The new evidence was shown publicly for the first time Sunday night in the six-part HBO documentary, 'The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst.' 

Durst's father, Seymour, was a New York real estate mogul who amassed billions 
of dollars worth of commercial property in Manhattan.

Robert, a 
well-connected socialite, worked for his father's Durst 
Organization for years as a developer.

But he was estranged from his 
family around 1994 after being passed over as heir to the company 
leadership in favour of his brother Douglas.

The 
Houston Chronicle reported that in 2006 he finally won a $65 million 
court settlement from his family, restoring a piece of his family 
fortune.

Ten years earlier, Durst had gained infamy in New Yorkdue to the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Kathie, and many believed the real estate scion had something to do with it. 

Durst, whose sometimes bizarre life inspired the Hollywood movie All Good Things, was questioned in her murder - and in the murder of her friend when the case was re-opened in 2000 - but was never charged.

He has now re-married, KTRK reported, but the identity of his new wife was not released.

Then in September 2001, remnants of the body of Morris 
Black, Durst's next-door neighbor in the boarding house where he was 
living, were found floating in the Galveston Bay in 
Galveston, Texas.

A trail of blood led police back to an apartment being rented by a mute woman,
Dorothy Ciner - who was actually Durst in a dress.

The 71-year-old was then questioned in 2000 after the death of his longtime friend and elderly neighbor Susan Berman, (pictured) shortly before she was to be questioned about what, if anything, she knew about Kathy's disappearance

Questions: Durst, with his wife Kathleen Durst, was suspected to be responsible for her 1982 disappearance

It emerged that Durst had gone into hiding for years, partially to escape the increasing inquiries about the death of his wife.

After
 spending a month on the run, Durst tried to steal a chicken 
salad sandwich and a single a Band-Aid from a supermarket in 
Philadelphia while wearing a blond mustache and was arrested.

Durst
 admitted to shooting Black and dismembering him before dumping the body parts in the Bay.

But he insisted that he had acted in self defense as they struggled over a handgun and he was acquitted.

But he was found guilty for tampering with evidence over the disposal of the body and was sentenced to five years in prison, but served just one.

Despite his run-ins with the law, he still has access to his $43 million trust fund, which he has used to buy and develop real estate in New York.

In December Durst pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief for exposing himself and urinating on candy at a Houston drug store.

His lawyer, Chip Lewis, blamed a 'medical mishap' for the incident in 2013 at the store near Durst's residence.

Lewis, in a statement handed to reporters, said Durst 'expressed his apologies' and has compensated the CVS drug store for damage.

He was also ordered to pay a $500 fine. 

In the same month he was found not guilty  of trespassing on property in midtown Manhattan owned by his estranged family. 

Durst,  was accused of violating orders of protection obtained by some of his relatives, including his brother Douglas.

'I'm not spending my time running around 43rd Street wanting to shoot my brother,' he told media outside the courtroom after the verdict in his two-day trial. Douglas Durst is chairman of the Durst Organization, the family company.

Prosecutors failed to prove to the judge hearing the case in Manhattan that Durst knowingly trespassed on residential properties owned by the company despite a video showing him walking up the exterior stairs of one of them. 

In the latest proceeding, Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Ann Scherzer vacated the 13 restraining orders keeping Durst away from family members. 

The Durst Organization oversees the lease and maintenance of One World Trade Center, the Western Hemisphere's tallest skyscraper, built on the site of the twin towers destroyed in an attack by hijacked airliners on Sept. 11, 2001.
