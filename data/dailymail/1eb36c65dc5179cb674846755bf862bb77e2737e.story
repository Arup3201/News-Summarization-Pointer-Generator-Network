Whoever struck the deal to sell David Luiz for £50million deserves a knighthood. 

That fee allowed Chelsea to buy Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas and improve. 

Some of Luiz’s sweeping passes were Hoddle-like but when he has a responsibility to defend, he lets his team down. 

Look at how he let Branislav Ivanovic run off him for Chelsea’s goal.

The further Chelsea go in the Champions League, the more we will see of Ramires. 

He is Jose Mourinho’s ‘go to’ man in the tight games away from home and fits into that system perfectly. 

His presence makes Chelsea even more difficult to break down and allows Nemanja Matic to show a different, dynamic side to his game. 

A word too on Matic’s influence. Chelsea have only lost three times this season; Matic – who was excellent here – missed two of those games.

Set pieces could prove to be a big weapon for Chelsea going forward. 

They are such a powerful side, with players such as Ivanovic, Matic, John Terry and Gary Cahill. 

They are monsters in the air and could destroy teams who fail to cope with their physicality. 

Chelsea were overloading the area every time they had a wide free-kick or a corner. 

With their big men such as Ivanovic, the London side's scorer, Chelsea have great weapons at set pieces

Ivanovic was the man to find the net this time but Matic, John Terry and Gary Cahill also flood the box

PSG have a lot of big names but Marco Verratti put them all in the shade at times. 

The little Italian is a wonderful midfielder. 

He takes chances occasionally with how he uses the ball but you can see he is a classy little player and will continue to be an influence in this tie.

Little Italian Marco Verratti is a wonderful midfielder and stands out even more than PSG's superstars

Verratti attempts to keep close tabs on Chelsea's danger man Eden Hazard during the 1-1 draw

Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League last season, in part, because Eden Hazard failed to track back in the semi-final against Atletico Madrid. 

The same frailties were exposed here and Laurent Blanc clearly spotted that weakness.

Maxwell, Gregory van Der Wiel and Blaise Matuidi all overlapped to great effect and it will have driven Jose Mourinho to distraction.

Gary Cahill has been a stalwart and I’m a fan of his, but Kurt Zouma’s emergence seems to have rattled him. 

There comes a point in every player’s career when a young lad emerges to put pressure on you and Cahill’s frustrated reaction to the PSG equaliser was telling.
