This is the moment a giraffe crashed to the ground after being shot by a tranquilliser dart to free it from a trap left by poachers. 

The giraffe was treated by a team of vets and rangers after it was caught by the wire snare in Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda.

There are 130 armed rangers patrolling Murchison Falls who are leading the fight against poaching.

The African giraffe is an endangered species and its population has been decimated by about 40 per cent

Snares mean that giraffes often die lingering and painful deaths as they develop wounds that don't heal 

Hunting and poaching have decimated Africa's giraffe population by about 40 per cent. There are now only 80,000 animals currently in the wild.

As recently as 15 years ago, there were around 140,000 giraffes in Africa, according to a Giraffe Conservative Foundation study. 

Fewer than 300 'West African giraffes' remain in Niger, and only 700 'Rothschild's giraffes' left in Uganda and Kenya.

Dr Noelle Kumpel, from the Zoological Society of London told Mail Online: 'The threats are local. It's loss of habitat and increasingly it's poaching not for the international trade, but bush meat hunting.'

'Traditionally they get caught in snares by the poorer local people just looking for food,' she said. 'But those hunting higher profile animals have the firearms and automatic weapons which make it simple to kill the noticeable giraffe.' 

Giraffes are mainly caught in crude snares, 'which pull tight around their necks or legs, causing strangulation and horrific wounds,' according to Richard Bonham, the Director of Operations for the Big Life Foundation in Kenya.

As the noose gradually tightens, it can take some hours if not days for them to pass away, he added. 

'Snares are cruel. Animals often die lingering and painful deaths or they might break the snare and develop festering wounds that just don't heal,' said Dr Stephanie Romanach of The African Wildlife Conservation Fund. 

'Poachers frequently set large numbers of snares and forget where they set them or just leave them in the bush and what's the result? Large numbers of animals killed unnecessarily.'

Known for their sweet meat, commercial hunters trap and butcher them, before selling the produce in markets

Meat from the creatures can sell for as little as 30p per pound in markets and stalls in some African countries

The veterinary team at the Uganda Conservative Foundation, together with 130 armed rangers at the Uganda Wildlife Authority, work to conserve the endangered species. 

The poachers are hauling in record numbers of giraffes because many believe the  animal's meat and/or bone marrow is an HIV cure.

Giraffe skin is also thick, durable and suitable for a range of purposes such as making clothing, shoes, bags, belts, hats and covers for drums.

Their hair is used to make bracelets, necklaces and other jewellery as far back as ancient Egypt.

The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) rangers have in the last year alone removed more than 7,000 wire snares from the Park but still some giraffe are caught by the snares. 

Once a giraffe is darted, the rangers and vets are able to remove the snare and treat the resulting wounds. 

Murchison Falls National Park is Uganda's largest and oldest conservation area, hosting 76 species of mammals and 451 birds.
