Prisoners’ right to day release could be severely  curtailed in light of a spate of alleged offences by inmates.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night launched a review amid public concern over two serious incidents in the last fortnight.

A double killer on his first solo day out is accused of murdering a Good Samaritan. Ian McLoughlin is charged with stabbing Graham Buck, 66, in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, on July 13.

Review: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling could curtail day release for prisoners

Mr Buck had responded to cries from the home of neighbour Francis Cory-Wright, 86, a paedophile McLoughlin, 55, met in prison.

On Thursday a man thought to be on day release from Ford open prison held up a bank with a gun in Borough, South-East London.

Last night Mr Grayling said: ‘I have asked for a review of the way in which we carry out releases on temporary licence to see whether any changes are necessary.

‘We need a process for people to be reintegrated into the community at the end of their sentence, but it needs to be right and it needs to be something the public has confidence in.’

Hundreds of prisoners are let out of jail every year for short periods before the end of their sentence. This ‘release on temporary licence’ is supposed to prepare them for normal life.

Most are from open prisons and can be for a day or overnight. Some are supervised but other inmates are let loose and required only to return at a specified time.

No one should be released if they could be a threat to the public.

Prison authorities conduct risk assessments of a criminal’s past and behaviour behind bars to judge if they are a danger – but the process is far from perfect.

Prison unions warn inmates who are not safe are being wrongly put in open prisons too early.

The review is likely to look at how inmates’ risk level is judged.

In Thursday’s hold-up, drinkers dived under tables as the armed suspect ran through the George pub in Borough pursued by bank guards. He allegedly fled a local Barclays empty-handed.
