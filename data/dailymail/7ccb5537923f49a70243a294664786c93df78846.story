Laughing, relaxed and waving at the cameras, a new world exclusive video filmed by the Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine shows the One Direction boys as you’ve never seen them before.

In the brand new footage of the world’s biggest pop band, it offers fans an unmissable glimpse behind the scenes as the five megastars lark in front of the cameras.

The video comes as this Sunday, exclusively in The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine, One Direction give the most incredible access yet to their extraordinary lives.

National treasures: This Sunday Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan feature in a special souvenir edition of Event magazine

Before
the release of their eagerly anticipated new album Midnight Memories on
Monday, Event magazine flew to Sydney to spend five days with the young
superstars to gain rare access to their incredible lives.

Set
to One Direction’s new single Story Of My Life, the unique video opens 
with Liam Payne offering a cheeky smile to the cameras and shows Harry 
Styles and his band mates as they try out poses for Event Magazine’s 
cover shoot.

The amazing 
footage is sure to bring a smile to every fan’s face as the five boys 
affectionately put their arms around it each other and pull faces as 
they joke together in the studio.

In
this Sunday’s souvenir edition, you will be able to get your hands on 
the five fabulous new full-page individual portraits they are seen 
posing for in the video, revealing their striking new ‘grown-up’ look.

And
in worldwide exclusive interviews no 1D fan will want to miss, they 
talk with incredible honesty about the realities of fame. 

Behind the scenes: Exclusive video let's fans get up close and personal on the boys' shoot

Speaking
between shows on their sell-out tour, the five boys reveal how they 
cope with the pressure of performance and growing up in the glare of the
public eye.

Niall Horan, 
Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson show off the 
more mature side to their personalities, as they develop from 
fresh-faced schoolboys into swaggering young men.

Over
the past three years, One Direction have conquered the world, selling 
62 million records and achieving 61 No. 1 singles and albums worldwide.

Since
finding fame on The X Factor in 2011, the five heart-throbs have now 
broken America, to become the biggest British band there since The 
Beatles – and they have more than 100 million Twitter followers between 
them.

The band’s previous album, Take Me Home, topped the charts in more
than 35 countries and sold 4.4 million copies worldwide - and now it 
seems their newest album is destined for similar commercial success.

The
first single from Midnight Memories, Best Song Ever, has over 153 
million views on YouTube and was named Song of the Summer in the MTV 
Video Music Awards, while Story of My Life already has 43 million views 
after just two weeks.

While
they are known to induce hysteria in their legion of devoted teenage 
fans, they have also built up a fan base across all generations.

In 
February, the Prime Minister was revealed to be a One Direction fan. A 
recent study revealed that 46 per cent of the band’s fans are aged 35 
and above, while 15 per cent are over 55.
