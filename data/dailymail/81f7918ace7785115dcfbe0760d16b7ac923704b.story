His only child hoped to inherit 
£11million. But with the prospect of lengthy and expensive legal battles
 ahead as victims file damages claims, and his paintings plummeting in 
value, much of Rolf Harris’s fortune could be wiped out. 

Recent
 published accounts show that his millions are tied up in a network of 
companies and family trusts, two of which were set up in 2012 – months 
before he faced police investigation.

His oldest company, Rolf Harris Enterprises, was launched in 1963.

It has £1.13million in 
the bank and £2.5million in assets, with directors including his brother
 Bruce Harris, wife Alwen, niece Jennifer Harris and daughter Bindi 
Nicholls.

A separate 
company set up in January 2012 called Rhel Holdings lists Harris and his
 wife as shareholders and Bruce, Alwen and Jenny Harris as directors.

Figures show it contains profits of £1,654,379 and capital of £2,080,528 from Rolf Harris Enterprises.

A third company, RHE Investments – also set up in 2012 – is a family 
trust which controls £1.6million in cash and £5.3million in fixed assets
 and investments.

But Southwark Crown Court heard Bindi was anxious that her future should be secured.

She wrote an email to her parents on July 25, 2012 – before his arrest – referring to an inheritance of ‘around £11million’. 

She
 said: ‘I understand that I am sole inheritor of your estate – is this 
true? If I am, then I feel you both have to sit down and discuss your 
feelings or beliefs about this inheritance.

‘If
 I am going to inherit this money, I need to be part of the running of 
the company as it will be my responsibility in the future? It’s a 
massive responsibility that I need to understand and feel empowered by 
and part of...

‘Please imagine how it is for me... figures in millions are being talked about willy-nilly.

‘It’s
 like being told that you might be winning the lottery at some point and
 you get excited and dream about the things you “could” do.’
