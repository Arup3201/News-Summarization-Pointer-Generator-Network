When vicar's secretary Claire Sandys spotted a bird stuck to roof netting, she called the RSPCA to see if they could help.

What followed, however, was the sort of full-scale emergency response you might expect for a serious road accident.

Two police cars, a rapid response vehicle, and two fire engines, one of which had a cherry picker, were dispatched to the scene in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and the road was closed for an hour as emergency crew worked to free the troubled rook.

A spokesman for the fire service said if more urgent calls had come in, the crews would have been diverted

Ms Sandys, personal assistant to the vicar at Trinity Church, in Winchcombe Street, saw the rook caught by its leg in netting which had been put on a nearby roof to stop birds roosting.

She said: 'It wasn’t nice watching this poor bird suffer on the rooftop over the road from our window.  It kept just lying down, like it had died, then trying to get free again when a seagull came over.

'It was a sorrowful sight, and it seemed so sad to leave him there - after all, it is one of God’s creatures, so I just called the RSPCA to let them know.'

Then followed the hour-long rescue operation, estimated to have cost around £1,600, based on an approximate cost of £320 per emergency crew, per hour, before the bird was taken to a nearby wildlife centre.

It is estimated the rescue cost around £1,600 - approximately £320 per crew per hour.

Today local residents criticised the money being spent on rescuing one bird.

Writing on Twitter, Tom Wheatly said: 'So it takes two fire engines and two police cars to rescue one bird from the roof of a three-storey building in the middle of Cheltenham.

'Two fire engines and two police cars, when human beings die from ambulances not getting there in time.'

Ellie Rose, 18, a waitress at Spencers cafe in the street said: 'We were watching the whole thing and thought it was ridiculous, and pretty over the top.

Firefighters worked in tandem to rescue the bird, which was caught in netting designed to deter seagulls

'Initially we thought it was a cat that was stuck up there, but then we got the information from the fire fighters that it was bird. We had a little giggle in the cafe.'

A Gloucestershire Police said he didn't know how many officers attended or how much the call-out would have cost.

He said: 'They [the fire service] only asked us to close the road.

'The fire engine they were using, it would have blocked it [the road].'

When asked for the average cost of a call out of this nature, he said: 'There are so many variables, it is impossible to say.'

Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman, Dave Hornibrook, said: 'When undertaking a rescue of this nature, we can redirect crews to a more serious incident.'

Staff at Vale Wildlife Rescue centre, in Beckford, Gloucestershire, said the bird was recovering and 'in good spirits'.
