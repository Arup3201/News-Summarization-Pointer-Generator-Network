Tragic: Robbie Millward died of a heart attack at the age of just 19 after using cocaine

The super-fit son of a top rugby league coach died of a heart attack at 19 two nights after he 'experimented' with cocaine, an inquest heard.

Athletic Robbie Millward, son of Castleford Tigers boss Ian, had a seizure at his family home in Leigh, Greater Manchester, after trying the Class A drug with friends last February.

The teenager was found unconscious on the sofa by his mother Leeane after she returned from a shopping
trip.

Mrs Millward, 51, a nurse said: 'It was lunchtime, about 12.30pm. He 
didn’t seem any different. I woke him and asked if he would go to the 
shops to get me the Sunday papers but he said "no, I’m tired, can you 
get me a drink?"'.

She returned home to find her son unresponsive and she carried out basic life-saving skills and called an ambulance.

He was rushed to hospital but died later and forensic examinations 
revealed cocaine was found in the teenager’s system which had 'scarred 
and inflamed' his heart.

Comforted by family members as she tried to hold back her tears in court, Mrs 
Millward told the coroner: 'I’m a nurse, so when I found him his pupils 
were already dilated I knew then the prognosis wasn’t very good.

'The ambulance was there very rapidly, they tried everything they could too, but he just didn’t recover.'

Mrs Millward said she was unaware her son had tried drugs.

'I want to be able to stop somebody else doing this - every bit of that drug is harmful. I spoke to him on a couple of occasions 
about all the dangers of taking them. He assured me he wasn’t taking 
any,' she added.

The hearing in Bolton, Greater Manchester was told the young joiner was 'very athletic and very healthy' and studying engineering three times a week.

He was often seen with his father at Super League matches and was 
pictured with Mr Millward senior proudly holding the World Club 
Challenge in 2001 when the coach was in charge at St Helens.

Tragedy struck after Robbie dabbled in cocaine use with friends while his father was on a tour of France where Castleford were playing.

Robbie’s friend Christopher Mayren was asked whether Robbie may have taken cocaine on occasions, perhaps through peer pressure and he replied: 'Yes, but it was very rarely.'

Death: The coroner said that although Robbie had not been a regular user of cocaine, the amount he took did something to his heart

Another pal Joshua Gannon said he knew Robbie had taken a small amount of the drug two nights before he died.

Consultant pathologist Dr Simon Suvarna, who examined Robbie’s heart, concluded there were areas of inflammation and scarring on his heart.

He said drugs like cocaine can cause this, as it makes the heart work harder and faster. It can also lead to dysrhythmia.

Dr Suvarna said: 'It is likely that this man had an unfortunate side-effect to this drug which may not have affected other people. We all have different bodies.

'The heart doesn’t repair itself. Once you have these small areas of scarring, that’s it.

'The result is an on-going cycle of damage. I cannot explain why this young man had this, but we do see a regular and steady trickle of cases come into the autopsy room and we are aware that a low dose doesn’t mean it’s safe.'

Recording a narrative verdict Bolton Coroner Allan Walsh said:'A message that needs to get out to anybody who even considers the use of cocaine, is that any use can cause damage to the heart and it doesn’t require an overdose situation or excess use.

'Robert was a 19-years-old at the time of his death. He was very athletic, very fit and very healthy. He was also a hardworking young man, who wanted to develop his education by going to college.

'He was like many people in his generation, who wanted worked hard and played hard. He had lots of friends. The loss of a son at the age of 19 is unimaginable.'

He told Mrs Millward: 'Your son was not a regular user of cocaine. I’m extremely saddened by the death of Robert. I believe he was a fine young man who was hard working, enjoyed his life and was good at sport.'

Robbie’s father who has coached Wigan, St Helens and Leigh Centurions, was not at the hearing but in a statement earlier this year thanked people who paid their respects.

He said: 'The messages have been of comfort in this time of great sadness.

'Robbie was a healthy young boy who died from a condition called sudden adult death syndrome which comprises of a massive heart attack. The sudden nature of his death is making it even harder for us to deal with.'

The teenager’s grandfather Bob who works for the Australian Rugby League said: 'It’s such a shock for the whole family. Robbie was a great kid, but now he’s gone. It’s heartbreaking.

'I remember when Ian first went over there and coached St Helens, young Rob would sit next to him in the coach’s box and the television commentators used to always call him the assistant coach.'
