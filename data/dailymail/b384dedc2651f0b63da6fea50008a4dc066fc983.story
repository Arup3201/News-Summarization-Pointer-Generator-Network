With their intricate designs and delicate stitching, you could be forgiven for thinking these elaborate costumes are destined for ballet dancers or musicians.

But these outfits are in fact specifically designed for bullfighters to wear in the ring before a charging 1,100-pound bull.

Master tailor Fermin Lopez Fuentes founded his bullfighters' bespoke tailor shop in 1963 and it has made outfits for some of the best bullfighters in the business.

The shop called Fermin, based in Madrid, Spain, is now run by the founder's brother Antonio with the help of an experienced team of tailors.

Costumes, which take a team of tailors weeks to make, can cost anything from a couple of hundred of euros to many thousands. 

Fermin, as one of only six specialist tailors in Spain to make only bullfighting costumes, also makes many of the outfits for Spain's famous San Fermin festival which sees the country's best matadors show off their skills every July.

Spectacle: Bullfighters' costumes are traditionally extremely tight fitting but must also be careful not to restrict the matador's movements

Tradition: Bullfighter uniforms are also sometimes referred to as 'suit of lights' because of the rhinestones, beads and gold or silver thread used in the designs

Workshop: Tailors at Fermin's work on several bullfighters' outfits which traditionally consist of form-fitting trousers that reach the midcalf and stockings, a vest, a short jacket, a thin tie decorated with beads, velvet and lace

Most bullfighters' capes depict  religious images - such as this one which has detailed embroidery reading 'JHS', standing for 'Jesus Savior Man'

The bullfighters tailor shop 'Fermin' was founded in 1963 by Fermin Lopez Fuentes and has made outfits for some of the world's most famous matadors

The costumes, which have remained largely unchanged for 170 years, are designed to flatter the bullfighter's figure

The traditional costume is inspired by the dress of 16th- and 17th- century warriors who were facing their death

Practical: Instead of silk, which soaks up blood, the suits now are made usually with synthetics so they can be washed and worn in dozens of fights

Specialists: Tailors of bullfighters outfits are often considered artists by their clients who demand their own unique costumes
