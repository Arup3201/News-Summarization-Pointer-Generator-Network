A British neuroscientist who revolutionised our understanding of how the brain works has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine.

Professor John O’Keefe, who discovered the brain’s ‘inner GPS system’, has been instrumental in unveiling the way in which Alzheimer’s disease destroys the lives of millions.

He has been researching the brain for 50 years and yesterday warned that ageing populations all over the world are creating a health ‘time bomb’.

British scientist John O'Keefe, from University College London, made the first discovery that contributed towards his prize in 1971

Thirty-four years later, May Britt and Edvard Moser, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, discovered another type of nerve cell in the brain - the 'grid cell'

But he said experts now know more than ever about how the disease works – and urged scientists to follow his lead in a search for a cure.

Professor O’Keefe said yesterday he was ‘still in shock’ at being awarded the prize, adding: ‘It is the highest accolade you can get. It is a terrific sign of the way the world thinks about the works we have been doing and how the world thinks about British neuroscience.’

Who are they?

John O'Keefe, 75, an American-British professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London; May-Britt Moser, 51, and Edvard Moser, 52, a married team of neuroscientists at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.

For what? 

For their discoveries of how rats determine where they are and how to move through the world. 

That lead to a deeper understanding of how the brain, including ours, creates a map of the environment - essentially an inner global positioning system, or GPS.

What's the significance?  

Professor O'Keefe's discoveries had 'a dramatic impact on the study of how the brain creates behavior,' the Nobel committee said. 

Thirty years later, the Mosers' research in the same field found how activities in so-called grid cells allowed the brain to divide the environment into longitude and latitude, which helps the brain know how far it is from any given starting point.

Together the three scientists were cited for having helped bring about a 'paradigm shift in our understanding of how groups of specialized nerve cells work together to execute higher brain functions.'

Some say this understanding could eventually revolutionise the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Professor O’Keefe, 75, was born in New York but came to University College London as a researcher in 1967. He became a joint US-British citizen after he made the first key discovery in understanding the brain’s navigation system in 1971.

He discovered the brain has ‘place cells’ which are specifically for storing memories and together form a kind of map.

Some 34 years later Professor O’Keefe and Norwegian couple May-Britt and Edvard Moser made a further breakthrough in finding a cell that generates a co-ordinate system for path-finding.

Crucially, the scientists found how Alzheimer’s works at a cellular level by blocking off this ‘internal GPS’ system, which explains why dementia patients often seem disorientated.

Professor O’Keefe said the work provided a basis for great strides in Alzheimer’s research. ‘If you do know how the brain works then we have the chance to look at disease,’ he said.

‘We all know there is a time bomb there. I can’t say when we will have a cure, but we now know through our findings how to ask the question of what is going wrong at the earliest stage of Alzheimer’s.’ The Nobel Assembly awarded the £690,000 prize jointly to Professor O’Keefe and the Mosers.

It said their findings represent a ‘paradigm shift’ in our knowledge of the brain, adding: ‘It has opened new avenues for understanding other cognitive processes, such as memory, thinking and planning.’

Professor O’Keefe, who was recently presented a separate award by US President Barack Obama, said: ‘I do what I do merrily out of curiosity, because I want to know how the brain works. That will get me up early in the morning and keep me going all day long.’

An excited May-Britt Moser, 51, said: 'This is crazy!' after learning they had won.

She said her 52-year-old husband didn't immediately find out about the prize because he was flying Monday morning to the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany, to demonstrate their research.

American-born Professor O'Keefe, of University College London,  identified the first component, when he found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room

'This is such a great honor for all of us and all the people who have worked with us and supported us,' she said, adding they had been together for 30 years. 

'We are going to continue and hopefully do even more groundbreaking work in the future.'

Hege Tunstad, a spokeswoman at the university in Trondheim, said May-Britt Moser was at the university when she found out she had won.

'She needed a minute to cry and speak with her team,' Tunstad said. 'Her husband was on a plane so he doesn't know yet.'

The Nobel Assembly said that knowledge about the brain's positioning system may 'help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss', that affects people with Alzheimer's disease.

The discoveries have also opened new avenues for understanding cognitive functions such as memory, thinking and planning, it said. 

'Thanks to our grid and place cells, we don't have to walk around with a map to find our way each time we visit a city because we have that map in our head,' said Juleen Zierath, chair of the medicine prize committee. 

'I think, without these cells, we would have a really hard time to survive.' 

Colleagues and scientists were quick to praise the trio's 'revolutionary' work.

Professor John Aggleton, president-elect of the British Neuroscience Association said Professor O'Keefe, who helped found the association, was highly deserving of the accolade.

Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust added: 'He is a world leader who has inspired a generation of neuroscientists, and whose work as founding director of the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre will further enhance our knowledge of neural circuits and how we behave. 

'I know from our many hours of discussions about this hugely exciting project that he is an individual of great humanity, integrity and personal generosity.  

'He is also a truly exceptional scientist and it is an honour for me to have worked closely with him over the last year. 

'On behalf of myself and the Wellcome Trust I am delighted to offer our very warmest congratulations to John.' 

The professor, who is married with two sons, is considering putting his half of the prize money towards a scientific trust.
