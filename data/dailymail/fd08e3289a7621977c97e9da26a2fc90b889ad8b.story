A British couple and their disabled daughter have been found shot dead on the Costa del Sol in a suspected murder-suicide.

The bodies were found yesterday morning in their £350,000 rented apartment in the resort of Mijas.

Spanish police said there were no signs of a struggle at the building and they were working on the theory that the father shot his wife and daughter before killing himself.

Last night the dead man was named locally as Philip Wood, his wife as Sheila, believed to be originally from Ireland, and their daughter Sophie.

Grim: The bodies - believed to be those of a couple and their daughter in her 20s - were discovered by their landlord in this rented apartment

There were claims that the family had been suffering from financial problems.

‘The latest information we have is 
that the owner of the house had not heard from the family for a few days
and had not been paid,’ said a Guardia Civil spokesman.

‘He went to the house today and when there was no reply at the door, he went inside.

‘Inside he saw the man dead on the 
sofa and immediately called the Guardia Civil.

When officers inspected 
the house they found the wife and the daughter dead in a bedroom.

‘The initial hypothesis at this early stage is that this was a murder-suicide.’

The spokesman would not confirm reports that the daughter, who was in her 20s, had Down’s syndrome.

He said: ‘The main line of 
investigation points to a  double murder by the father followed by his 
suicide. But the investigation is still in its early stages.’

Scene: A shopping basket can be seen outside the front door to the property. There was not believed to be any sign of a struggle inside

Investigation: The Foreign Office has said it is 'urgently' looking into the deaths. Drying racks for washing can be seen outside the building

The family had lived in the Torrenueva
complex in Mijas, which is midway between Marbella and Malaga, for 
about seven years. The apartment building is in a quiet, tree-lined 
street in the village, which is popular with British expatriates and 
tourists.

The bodies were removed yesterday afternoon and a police cordon set up.

A friend of the family said: ‘He had a
lot of problems on his back. His daughter was grown-up but her mind was
that of a baby’s and his wife had been ill for some time.

‘He did work in a bank but told me he had changed his job.’

Neighbours said debt collectors had 
visited the family in recent days. Several said they had heard shots, 
sparking speculation the bodies may have lain undiscovered for some 
time.

Dutch neighbour Elizabeth Van 
Heyningen, 66, said: ‘The couple have been in my house for a drink.

'They
were both British but I don’t know where from. He seemed very nice. He 
must have been in his late  fifties. He used to work in a Spanish bank 
before becoming an estate agent and then losing his job. I think they 
had run out of money.

Tragic: A police officer places tape around the outside of the building

Horrific: Emergency workers can be seen at the scene

‘He used to drive a BMW and his wife 
had a nice car of her own but then they sold them for a hired Opel they 
used to drive. In recent weeks I hadn’t seen them driving anything.

‘A couple of weeks ago I saw him walking up the hill to his house with heavy bags of shopping.

‘His wife had fallen ill in recent 
months and he often came round asking if I could do anything about 
another neighbour’s barking dog which was upsetting her. The talk round 
here is he killed his wife and daughter and then turned the gun on 
himself.’

Garage owner Kevin Watts, 65, an 
immediate neighbour, said: ‘They lived like hermits. They always kept 
the metal shutters on their windows down.’

Pleasant: Mijas is known for being civilised and family friendly

Expat Suzanne Hughes, 58, added: ‘I 
heard three shots the other day. I put it down at the time to someone 
shooting wild boar. I even joked, “I hope someone’s not being shot”.’

Mijas is a typical Andalusian, white-washed village with cobbled streets set in the mountains overlooking the sea.

Dawn Dale, who runs the Original 
English Tearoom there, said the deaths would come as a shock to the 
close-knit British community.

‘There is hardly any crime here’, she said. ‘It is a very laid back, chilled-out place.’

The Foreign Office said it was ‘urgently’ looking into the reports of the deaths.
