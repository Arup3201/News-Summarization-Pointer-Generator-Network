Louis van Gaal has revealed he will adopt the three-man central defence he used with Holland in the World Cup over the course of the Barclays Premier League season with Manchester United.

Van Gaal’s United team beat LA Galaxy 7-0 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on Thursday morning playing a 3-4-3 system alien to most fans of the English club.

After the game the former Holland coach confirmed he will use that system in the Premier League in order to get an extra centre forward on the field. He added that the squad he has inherited from David Moyes lacks balance.

Van Gaal said: 'We introduced a new system that we have only played two times on the training pitch 11 v 11.

'But the boys are willing to pick up the information.

'It is fantastic how they have performed today.

'Last week, 10 players who played tonight were not even in our training complex.

'When you want to change a system, you must start at once. We don’t have time to prepare for other things.

'The other system they can play is 4-3-3 and they have played it for many years.

'I can change back if the system doesn’t work. With the quality of the players we have, I can play 4-3-3 with three strikers on the bench, but I want to play with two strikers.

'We have four No 10s, so the selection is not balanced in my eyes.

'I have decided to play this system because of the quality of the players.

'But if we lose, I can change back to another system.'

United led 3-0 at half-time in their opening tour game and went on to score four more in the second half.

Van Gaal added: 'When you see us train, you can expect something but not 7-0.

'It was a surprise, but they were also beautiful goals.

'It was not just the goals, but the beautiful attacks.

'I never go back, I always want to see the future.

'When I see my team playing a new system, it is better to win 7-0 than to lose because the players will then doubt the system.

'But now I don’t have that problem.'
