Furious: Newly released documents show that Iain Duncan Smith accused the BBC of promoting Labour's views by calling a key welfare reform a 'bedroom tax'

Iain Duncan Smith accused the BBC of promoting Labour’s views by calling a key welfare reform a ‘bedroom tax’, newly released documents show.

In a furious letter, the Work and Pensions Secretary said the corporation was misleading viewers and the phrase was ‘innately political and indeed factually wrong’.

Documents released under Freedom of Information legislation show Government officials have complained repeatedly about BBC coverage.

Former immigration minister Damian Green wrote to bosses saying its reports were ‘inconsistent and unacceptable’.

There is growing pressure on the corporation from Tories angered by its perceived bias.

On Sunday, party chairman Grant Shapps said it could lose its exclusive right to licence fees in the 2016 charter review.

Mr Duncan Smith wrote to Fran Unsworth, then acting head of news, on March 7 to complain about use of the term ‘bedroom tax’ in reports on his housing benefit reforms, which cut handouts to working-age claimants in social housing with more bedrooms than they needed.

Accusing the BBC of a ‘public disservice’, he said: ‘It is not a tax and it is wrong to describe it in this way.

‘A tax, as the Oxford English Dictionary makes clear, is a “compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the  government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services and transactions”. What this policy does is reduce some social housing tenants’ benefits if their home has one or more spare bedrooms. This cannot in any way be described as a tax.’

He added: ‘What should not happen, is for the BBC to adopt the language of the Labour Party without making it clear that the phrase is innately political and indeed, factually wrong. We do not believe it is the job of the BBC to use misleading terms and promote the views of the Labour Party.’

On September 3 last year, Mr Green – now police minister – said the BBC did not report immigration data accurately.

He said it was ‘mystifying’ that a 36,000 drop in migration was described as ‘a slight drop’.

Criticism: Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps, left, has said the BBC could lose its exclusive right to licence fees, while former immigration minister Damian Green, right, said its reports were 'inconsistent'

The minister added he was ‘very unhappy’ with a Radio 5 Live show in which he was asked to debate with a representative of the National Union of Students.

He said: ‘Immigration is a  sensitive and serious topic. It deserves to be treated as such.’

On Sunday, Mr Shapps criticised a report by BBC home editor Mark Easton on a Brussels study of migrants’ benefits and said the BBC could see its licence fee cut unless it addresses accusations of bias and a culture of secrecy and waste.

A BBC spokesman said it ‘aims to provide clear, impartial and balanced coverage’, and added: ‘Inevitably there will be disagreements about the reporting of any given political story, however we are satisfied that on the whole our coverage is fair, accurate  and impartial.’
