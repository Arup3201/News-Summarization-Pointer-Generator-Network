A swarm of mutant  rats that are immune to poison is 'closing in' on a Wiltshire town, pest exterminators have warned.

The rodents, which have been seen elsewhere in the UK over the past year, are twice as large as normal species and cannot be killed with traditional substances.

It comes after the discovery of one rodent at a food establishment measuring 20-inches, the largest on record for the town of Swindon.

This rat found in Swindon is the largest on record for the Wiltshire town. Pest exterminators have warned an influx of super rats may be on its way, with the rodents immune to traditional poisons

'It's a growing problem, and at the moment there's no sign it'll go away,' said Justin Holloway who found the rat in Swindon, told MailOnline.

'Unless you can extinguish all of the genetic line the rise of super rats is on the horizon.'

At longer than 20-inches, it is the largest to have ever been found in Swindon. Though the rat was killed using traditional anti-coagulant poison, Mr Holloway warned others that are immune to the substance will become 'a greater problem.

'One particular strain of rats were not so susceptible to rodenticides or the anti-coagulants served and, as a percentage of the total rat population, they become greater over time.

'As far as resistance is concerned, it is a growing issue and over a period of time I expect this to be a greater problem than it currently is, but establishing a time-frame is harder. 

'The implication is if you are a rat and you're not being taken on, you might enjoy a longer life and grow to a larger size, because you are not being taken down.

'If there's a good source of food and water it becomes a larger rat.'

Mr Holloway added while he had not found any mutant rats in Swindon, their population will continue to grow across the UK. 

'Most counties have shown there are some strains of genetically different rats however it's whether they have a particular control problem that's the issue. 

'We haven't had any major control issues but companies like ours need to adapt new strategies for new rodents.'  

Super rats are typically larger than sewer rats and cannot be killed by traditional rodenticides. 

The species has developed a genetic mutation which means substances approved by the EU to control rat populations has no effect on them. 

Pest controllers are calling for new rules to be made allowing the creation of stronger poisons, though the health and safety risk to humans and the environment this bears is a bone of contention. 

Most rats are found in food premises, though some have been recorded across the UK in homes. 

To prevent the creatures from infesting your home or business, experts advise keeping conditions spotlessly clean. 

Ensuring wheelie bins have proper drain holes is also important, said exterminators. 

'A rat in the wrong place is a problem for anybody so you have to be vigilant whether its commercial or residential.

'They'll chew water pipes, electric cables and it puts your property at risk,' said Justin Holloway of exterminators, Prokill.  

Earlier this year a number of abnormally large rats were recorded across the UK. 

Worried homeowners shared photographs of the rodents, some of which were as large as small cats. 

One, found on an industrial estate in Liverpool, measured two feet, while another in Gravesend, Kent, was the width of a shovel. 

Researchers at Huddersfield University performed studies on the rodents, with some parts of Britain more severely affected than others. 

In Gloucestershire and Shropshire, around 20 per cent of rats tested were immune to traditional poisons, while a third in Kingston could not be killed using the substances. 

In Southampton, 75 per cent of the rodents were found to have the genetic mutation. 

Speaking at the time, scientist Dr Dougie Clarke described the giant species as 'a time bomb'.

'I think people should be concerned about these resistant rats because of public health concerns - because they carry disease and various other bacteria and viruses.

'They also damage buildings…they cost billions of pounds of damage worldwide.

'With the use of rodenticides, that will kill off the normal rats, and then the resistant ones will remain.

'So it's a sort of time bomb of resistance building up over generations of rats.'

'The fact we've tested 17 counties and every single one of them has got resistant rats was an amazing find to us. We didn't expect to have every single county having resistant rats.'
