Stephanie Seymour has revealed that she specially built a massive closet at her home in Greenwich, Connecticut, where she puts all of her couture.

In images taken for an upcoming post on Estée Lauder's blog,The Estée Edit, the space is shown to house huge amounts of color-coordinated clothing, hundreds of pairs of designer shoes and at least eight Birkin bags, the beloved Hermes purses that can cost $20,000 or more. 

The 46-year-old supermodel said in an interview with Fashionista that she cares for her belongings much like a museum cares for its artwork: 'There is some hanging space, but it's mostly drawers because you want to keep everything in either boxes, or in acid-free tissue. It's all climate controlled, of course, and all of the drawers are glass and there's space on each side for a picture so I can see what's inside.'

Can we have one of those Birkins? In this photo of her closet, we spotted at least eight of the famous Hermes bags on the top shelf

She even keeps it locked up from her sons Harry, 18, and Peter Brant, Jr., 20. 

During the interview, she was asked if the pair tried to access her collection - which she's been amassing for nearly 20 years - to re-purpose the pieces to wear out.   

'Yes, but now I've bolted the dressing room door!' she said.

Shoes, shoes, everywhere! The photo shows just a portion of Ms Seymour's massive shoe collection 

Ms Seymour revealed that her favorite piece from the collection is her wedding dress, custom designed by Tunisian couturier Azzedine Alaia.

'It is a work of art and I got to watch the whole dress being made by hand,' she said. 'It’s a lot about the craftsmanship, the hand stitching. But honestly, if you find a designer that fits you well, ready-to-wear can feel like it’s made just for you.'

Ms Seymour, who's a close friend and muse to Mr Alaia, said she still frequently wears the designer's coats and dresses from 20 years ago because they make her feel 'like Stephanie.'

Ms Seymour has appeared in every major fashion magazine in the world - and she recently became a face for Estée Lauder alongside Kendall Jenner.

She was famously involved with Guns 'n' Roses lead singer Axl Rose in the 90s and starred in two of the band's music videos.

She married Peter Brant. Sr, a billionaire businessman, in 1995 and then filed for divorce from him in 2009. The pair reconciled in 2010.

Her sons Peter - who is openly gay - and Harry grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut.

As of the last few years, they are fixtures of the Manhattan socialite scene, frequently appearing at exclusive parties, fashion shows, polo matches and more.
