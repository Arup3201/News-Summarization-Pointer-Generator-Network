A simple eye test may be able to predict patients with Alzheimer's 20 years before the first symptoms appear, a Perth-based trial has found.

Preliminary results from the world-first trial were released on Sunday at the Alzheimer Association's international conference in Copenhagen because Australian scientists were so excited by the findings.

Dr Yogesan Kanagasingam from the CSIRO's e-Health Research Centre said if the trial's final results were positive, he hoped a cure for the disease could be found.

At the moment, it's only possible to detect the disease when the patient already has significant brain damage.

'You can do brain imaging, but that is at the later stages and it's already too late,' Dr Kanagasingam told the ABC.

'It is the first trial in the world to prove that this kind of thing could be used for identifying the Alzheimer's disease early.'

The final results are expected to be released in October, with just 40 of the 200 results already analysed.

Before undergoing an eye scan, patients in the trial ate curcumin, which is found in the spice turmeric.

The ingredient makes beta-amyloids stand out in an eye scan, which is the primary material found in characteristics of Alzheimer's. 

The trial is a joint venture between the CSIRO, Edith Cowan University and the McCusker Foundation.
