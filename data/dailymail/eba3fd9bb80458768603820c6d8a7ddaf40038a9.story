This building may look like a health and safety nightmare, teetering over the edge of a hillside.

But the Balancing Barn is safe as houses.

The 100ft-long hotel sits atop a mound of earth near a Suffolk nature reserve and even has a swing dangling below its hanging end.

Architects had fun with the house, adding a swing underneath the building

The house is available to rent through Living Architecture, a non-profit holiday homes company

The half of the building that hovers over the ground is made of lighter materials than the other, so there's no need to worry about tipping the balance. A concrete core keeps things sturdy.

The modern house, which sleeps up to eight people, was designed by Dutch firm MVRDV and is available for holiday hires through Living Architecture, a non-profit rental firm.

The company is owned by philosopher Alain de Botton, who said: 'We want to allow people to experience what it is like to live, eat and sleep in a space designed by an outstanding architectural practice.'

Up to eight people can stay in the house at once

The barn is surrounded by trees, giving privacy and a pretty view

He commissioned five designs from some 
of Europe's leading architects so that people had a chance to explore a 
modern property while enjoying the British countryside, at a time when 
many modern designs have been commissioned by private owners.

The barn is surrounded by trees, giving a colourful view as well as much-needed privacy.

Holidaymakers can also explore the nearby towns Walberswick and Aldeburgh from their stylish base near the coast.Â 

The swing dangling under the house shows the architects had fun in mind

Half of the 100ft-long building is lighter than the other, so the Balancing Barn is sturdy, despite appearances
