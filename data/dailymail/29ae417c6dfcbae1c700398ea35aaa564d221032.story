Missing: Patricia Wilson, 58, from Hertfordshire vanished without trace.

The house where a British expatriate is believed to have been murdered before disappearing in mysterious circumstances has been burgled, French police revealed

Patricia Wilson, 58, has not been for more than a month since bloodstains were found at her ‘dream’ cottage in the picturesque village of Vabre-Tizac, north of Toulouse.

Yet last week up to two intruders are said to have broken into the isolated property in the middle of the night.

Very little was taken, with detectives now trying to establish if they may have been linked to Ms Wilson’s disappearance.

It came as her alleged killer and ex-lover, 50-year-old Jean-Louis Cayrou, a French gardener, continued to insist he is innocent of any wrong-doing.

He is on remand in prison, but last week also visited the house, along with the instructing judge who is leading the investigation.

"The judge wanted him to retrieve some clothes which could be crucial to the enquiry" said a police source.

Mr Cayrou insists that he is innocent of any wrong-doing, and expressly denies having anything to do with the victim’s disappearance, let alone her murder.’

Confirming the burglary, the source said that it was 'amateur in nature’ and that the perpetrators did not seem to be after valuables.

This raises the possibility that they may have been trying to interfere with evidence, or indeed remove it, said the source.

Isolated: Patricia Wilson's home where large quantities of blood found inside.

The house, which is worth around 
£250,000 and set well away from neighbouring properties, is now empty 
and unguarded, with Ms Wilson’s two cats the only occupants.

Despite a search of surrounding water, including a lake at the bottom of the garden, police are no nearer finding Ms Wilson.

In recent days the hunt has 
‘downscaled’ towards the land around the cottage – increasing the 
likelihood that those responsible for attacking Ms Wilson may want to 
interfere with the crime scene.

French detectives launched a murder investigation after bloodstains were found in the cottage and a car belonging to Cayrou.

Later they confirmed that blood found in Cayrou’s Renault saloon was from Ms Wilson.

The forensic evidence supports prosecutors’ claims that Ms Wilson was killed by Cayrou in her house.

The pair had a relationship that Ms Wilson ended around two months ago, prompting Cayrou to allegedly try to strangle her.

He is then thought to have planned her murder, waiting for her in bushes as she returned from a trip home to England on August 17.

Detectives had hoped the DNA results would ‘persuade’ Cayrou to lead them to Ms Wilson’s corpse, but he insists they spent so much time together that it would be ‘normal’ to find traces of her DNA and indeed blood in his car.

He has also told prosecutors that any traces of her blood would have been mixed with that of animals that he hunted.

Cayrou has been charged with murder, with his trial expected late next year at the earliest.

Ms Wilson, a former advertising executive from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, moved to Vabre-Tizac five years ago with her long-term partner, Donald Marcus, 54.

However, the couple’s relationship became strained and they separated after Mr Marcus returned to England for an operation last November.

Ms Wilson became romantically involved with Cayrou in April this year after employing him to do the gardening and odd jobs around the house.

Cayrou moved into her cottage shortly afterwards, but it is believed Ms Wilson became frightened of his possessive, controlling behaviour.
