Natalie White has won the battle of the boobs.

The topless model claims that she was only able to persuade police officers not to shut down her raunchy gallery show on Manhattan's Lower East Side neighborhood after she invited them to see it.

The show, 'Who Shot Natalie White,' opens Wednesday night - and features numerous nude photos of Ms White - including some of her pleasuring herself.

'Who Shot Natalie White': The Rox Gallery features photos of Natalie White in various stages of undress - shot by nearly two dozen photographers

Model: Ms White, 24, is the subject of the exhibit, which features numerous photos of her in various stages of undress

Uproar: The photos of Ms White hanging in the gallery window is too much for some neighborhood residents to handle

Outside the gallery, nude images of Ms 
White are featured prominently in the windows, which became a problem 
for passersby on the busy Delancey Street.

The New York Post reported that numerous complaints about the exhibit led cops to be called to the gallery yesterday, where she released her feminine wiles on them.

The 24-year-old told the paper: 'We met the police. They said they would come tonight.

She added that the police 'came in full force,' and 'it was like a moment out of The Big Lebowski.'

Her lawyer, Ron Kuby, who specializes in First Amendment rights, questioned the actions of the officers, saying: 'Why did they feel it was necessary to come inside and meet the naked girl?'

Law and order: Ms White says the NYPD officers who responded to the gallery to investigate the complaints

'Maybe they’re just being thorough, leaving no stone unturned.'

The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request by MailOnline for comment.

The exhibit, which features Ms White in various stages of undress and shot by nearly two dozen photographers, is sure to cause a stir in the neighborhood.

Ms White told the paper that she can see why people would object to the photos, but believes people are taking the situation way too seriously.

Defense: Ms White says she can see why people would object to the photos, but believes people are taking the situation way too seriously

'I would imagine that a lot of people did [complain]... For some reason, they’re so conservative in the U.S.'

She also defended some of her raunchy shots, telling the Post: 'It’s not masturbation - it’s just making love to myself in the photographs.'

The gallery's curator, Gregory de la Haba, blames the area's senior citizens for notifying cops about 'Who Shot Natalie White.'

Mr de la Haba told the paper: 'One walked in from the street and said, "Take this pornography down!" I had no reaction. She kept saying "Take it down. It's pornography!" The ones who complain are the old people.'
