UK doping officials are to contact the IAAF to obtain more information following serious allegations surrounding one of the biggest stars in British athletics.

London lawyers representing the athlete moved into overdrive yesterday to make sure their client is not named, with threats of legal action if the star’s unblemished reputation was damaged in any way by being linked with known drugs cheats.

The star British athlete is named on a list — seen by Sportsmail — that details 150 athletes with alleged highly suspicious blood samples from 2006-08 that were not followed up with target testing by the IAAF. Three London 2012 champions are reportedly on the list as well. 

One of Britain’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up

The existence of the document — but not the identities — was revealed in an explosive series of three documentaries by German TV network ARD who were greatly helped by a senior whistleblower from within the IAAF medical and anti-doping commission. 

Two other Britons are listed but were fringe track-and-field performers, though one was tested before a major competition because of suspicions brought on by ill-advised comments pre-race. 

The well known British star was contacted by Sportsmail and given the opportunity to explain circumstances behind the high blood values that led to their inclusion on a list containing many athletes with doping records.

A number of them were found out after their blood samples showed suspiciously high concentrations of haemoglobin — a possible sign they were using blood-boosting endurance drug EPO. 

But although there are no suggestions that the result of the famous Briton’s blood sample — on the highest red tier of suspicious activity on the whistleblower’s document — was the result of doping, the only response to Sportsmail’s questions  came from the lawyers. 

However, UK Anti-Doping recognise the allegations as being in the public interest and their intelligence and operation team will seek talks with the IAAF. 

The UK doping officials want to ascertain if blood samples, which are frozen and can be retested, fall within the current eight-year limit for retrospective testing.

Dick Pound, the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), has lambasted the IAAF for not acting on allegations of systematic Russian doping

The IAAF have not disputed the authenticity of the documents but did issue a six-point rebuttal on Tuesday. 

Juan Manuel Alonso, chairman of their medical commission, said on Twitter: ‘Blood samples taken before 2009 were thoroughly examined.’ 

The latest doping scandal will add weight to Lord Coe’s campaign for the IAAF’s anti-doping system to be completely independent in terms of testing and sanctions. 

Coe, who is standing for election to succeed Lamine Diack as IAAF president next August, said: ‘This is the time to really push for a wholly independent arm to our testing procedures.’
