A Major League Baseball match between Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays erupted into a mass brawl on Sunday night.

The Red Sox, the current World Series holders owner by Liverpool supremo John W Henry, are currently on a 10-game losing streak - which is their worst run in 20 years.

And things got a little bit heated and it ended up all breaking into a fairly major scuffle.

Handbags: The whole thing resulted in a little bit of a skirmish

In the end, the Rays came out of the game 8-5 winners.

The hapless Red Sox have been outscored 52-24 during their last 10 matches, with last season's MVP DavidÂ  World Series MVP David Ortiz hitting just .118 and with no RBIs in that time.

It is their worst run since an 11-game slump in 1994, so with that in mind it is no wonder that things started to boil over a little bit.
