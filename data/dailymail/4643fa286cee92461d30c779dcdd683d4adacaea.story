Jamie Donaldson remained on course to secure his European Ryder Cup team place with a 69 in the second round of the D+D REAL Czech Masters at the Albatross Golf Resort.

The Welshman hit a three-under 69 to go nine under and stay a shot ahead of France’s Gregory Bourdy, who fired a 67.

Donaldson holds the eighth of nine automatic places for the team in Gleneagles due to his position on the world points list.

‘It’s been there for a while. It’s another week where you’re out there playing as well as you can.’
