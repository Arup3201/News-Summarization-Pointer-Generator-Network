Wayne Rooney’s one concession to the celebration of his 100th cap will be to lead out the England team with his sons Kai and Klay.

All being well, it will happen at Wembley next month against Slovenia. He will be the ninth English footballer to reach his century and, at 29, the youngest by nearly three years.

There will still be time to train his sights on Peter Shilton’s record of 125, though Roy Hodgson plans to set more immediate targets for his captain.

‘His goal should be quite a simple one,’ said Hodgson. ‘He should concentrate on France 2016 — a) make sure we get there, b) make certain if we are making any improvements that they continue, and c) take that responsibility.

‘Hopefully, if it all works out and we do qualify and are playing a bit better when we get there, I think it will be quite easy for him to take the next step. I wouldn’t worry too much about the next 25 caps. Get the next 10 in.’

The England manager speaks with genuine affection for Rooney, the man he chose to succeed Steven Gerrard, and staunchly backed him when he came under fire for his performances.

Rooney can polarise opinion. In Estonia, his free-kick won the game. He was always the player most likely to score and yet he was criticised for missing chances, just as he had done against San Marino last Thursday.

It is hard to argue with the facts. He has 43 goals in 99 games for his country. Sir Bobby Charlton’s 49-goal record is also in view.

‘As I’m edging closer, I think about it,’ said Rooney. ‘But I’m a strong believer that if it’s going to happen, it will. When that time comes I’ll be delighted. At the minute it’s a matter of wanting to score for the three points.’

Rooney has watched David Beckham, Gerrard, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard reach 100 caps during his England career, which started in a friendly against Australia in 2003. ‘It is a great honour,’ he said ‘I’ll be looking forward to it and excited about the next game. There’s no special plans but my two boys will walk on to the pitch with me. That’ll be it.

‘It is a fantastic achievement to play for your country for so long. I remember David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Frank and Ashley getting their hundred caps and how much it meant to them.

Born: Liverpool, October 24 1985 (28)

Playing position: Forward

2002-2004: Everton (67 lg apps, 15 gls)

2004-NOW: Manchester United (313, 161)

2003-NOW: England (99, 43) 

‘You don’t think you’ll achieve this when you first get into the team, but over the last two or three years, when I got into the 70s, 80s and 90s, then you know it is going to happen. I’ll be the youngest but I started younger than most.’

Rooney made his Everton debut at 16, against Tottenham in August 2002. Twelve years and more than 600 senior games later, he is warming to his leadership roles as captain of Manchester United and England.

For his country, he has inherited the penalty-taking responsibilities as well as the armband from Gerrard and produced a free-kick in Tallinn to rekindle memories of the days when Captain Becks stepped up to rescue the team with his dead-ball excellence.

Hodgson said: ‘When I came into the job two years ago, I didn’t quite know what to expect from him. My knowledge of him was shaped by TV, radio and newspapers. I was surprised. He is a very different person than I thought he would be; very driven and professional.

‘Since he has had the captaincy, he has taken on even more responsibility and to get 100 caps for your country is some achievement because of the competition you face for your shirt.

‘He has taken a bashing over the years and that has toughened him up. Some players get to 34-35 and don’t play anywhere near as much football as he has played.’

The England boss also praised him for taking over smoothly from Gerrard. ‘Both engage very well in particular with the younger players and give them the benefit of their knowledge and experience,’ said Hodgson.

‘Both are unbelievably passionate about England. You knew every time they went out on the field they would sweat everything for England. That doesn’t always mean they had great games but you don’t have to look at them and say, “He’s not at it today” or, “He’s not taking it seriously”. That is a great quality Wayne has.’
