A life of crime: Simon Berkowitz has been jailed for five and a half years for his latest of more than 250 convictions that date back more than five decades

A prolific burglar who stole notes revealing intimate details about Paddy Ashdown's affair with his personal assistant is facing yet another term in jail.

Pensioner Simon Berkowitz, 65, who has more than 250 convictions for burglary is about to start a five and a half year prison sentence after admitting a string of offences in the New Forest area of Hampshire.

Berkowitz pleaded guilty to five burglaries, including one count of going equipped to burgle and two counts of fraud which earned him more than £30,000.

He is now thought to be one of Britain's most prolific thieves with his convictions spanning more than 50 years.

Police
said what he has been convicted of is only 'the tip of the iceberg' and
it is believed he has committed thousands of burglaries over the years.

He
also has scores of other convictions to his name for handling stolen 
goods, going equipped to burgle and fraud since he first appeared at 
Worthing Juvenile Court aged 14 in 1961 on the charge of larceny.

He is now thought to be one of Britain's most prolific thieves with his convictions spanning more than 50 years.

Police said what he has been convicted of is only 'the tip of the iceberg' and it is believed he has committed thousands of burglaries over the years.

He also has scores of other convictions to his name for handling stolen goods, going equipped to burgle and fraud since he first appeared at Worthing Juvenile Court aged 14 in 1961 on the charge of larceny.

He was then given a two-year probation order and ordered to pay 38p in costs.

Since then, his criminal record has become 10 pages long and has included sentences totalling more than 40 years from Scotland to the Channel Islands and including Nottingham, Somerset, Wiltshire, Oxford, Devon and London.

Many of his offences were committed when he was released early on licence from previous jail terms.

But it was the Paddy Ashdown court case in August 1992 that Berkowitz was most infamous for.

Ironically, he was found not guilty at the Old Bailey of burgling the City of London offices of solicitors Bates, Wells and Braithwaite in January 1992 where an aide memoire detailing Mr Ashdown's affair with his former secretary Patricia Howard was stolen from a safe.

Berkowitz, who was at the time a Conservative Party member, tried to sell the document to the News Of The World for £30,000 and during his trial said a Labour Party supporter gave it to him.

He was convicted of handling stolen goods and sentenced to 30 months.

The jury was told afterwards he then had 230 convictions for burglary.

Rumours about the contents of the stolen document spread and Mr Ashdown was forced publicly to admit his affair with Ms Howard - prompting the famous Sun headline on February 6 1992: It's Paddy Pantsdown.

Berkowitz, an unemployed painter and decorator formerly from Hove in East Sussex, showed no emotion at Winchester Crown Court as the judge described him as a career burglar with no remorse for his victims, many who on this occasion were elderly.

Described by police as 'cold and calculated with no conscience whatsoever', Berkowitz also goaded his probation officers with a Christmas card he sent to them just before his arrest for the latest offences in late 2011.

The car depicted Santa Claus as a convict and said: 'Have a super Xmas and remember: crime does pay, ask any MP or bent copper.'

But an 'eagle-eyed' policeman, Pc Dean Miller, brought Berkowtiz's latest crime spree to an end when he saw him in Milford-on-Sea in Hampshire carrying a holdall.

He had been sent on patrol in plain clothes in December last year as the burglary rate in the Lymington, Brockenhurst and Milford-on-Sea areas of the New Forest soared as Berkowitz plied his trade.

When asked what was in the holdall, the burglar, born in Enfield, north London, replied: 'I'd rather not say'.

Police found inside two crowbars, a 
gas-operated blow torch and a magnifying glass to examine the jewellery 
and silverware - often of great sentimental value - Berkowitz liked to 
steal from homes in affluent areas when the owners were away.

He was even living in one empty home in Milford-on-Sea so he did not have to travel or spend money on hotels.

The flat he owned outright in Hove was searched and property from three of the burglaries was found there.

Berkowitz had also stolen cash cards he used at ATMs to draw cash dressed in clothes and hats to make him look much younger in an attempt to fool police.

In mitigation, the court heard that Berkowitz got 'a buzz' from burglaries and he was obsessive about silverware and jewellery and he liked to value them.

The court was also shown a letter to the court that said after seeing witness impact statements from his victims telling of the hurt he had caused he was now remorseful.

But prosecution barrister David Reid said that Berkowitz had written exactly the same words when he was jailed for 40 months on the Isle of Wight in 2010 for a series of burglaries and ordered to pay back nearly £83,000 in a confiscation order that has forced him to sell his flat.

Jailing him, Judge Jane Miller QC mentioned the fear of his victims, including one recently widowed woman who had only just moved back to England when Berkowitz stole jewellery of great sentimental value to her worth thousands of pounds.

Speaking outside the court, Detective Constable Robert Cox, who led the investigation, said: 'Berkowitz is a man who is a cold and calculated burglar who has no conscience whatsoever.

'For years he has inflicted anguish and hurt by invading the homes of his countless victims and stealing from them valuables that were often of great sentimental value.

'In these latest evil offences the victims were mostly elderly and were left in fear of living in their own homes after they had been ransacked by Berkowitz.'

Berkowitz was also given a two-year concurrent sentence for going equipped and a further one year each, again concurrently, for the two fraud offences.
