A teenage boy, 16, has been charged after a 14-year-old girl's birthday party was gatecrashed on Friday night.

The night was meant to be a low-key pizza party but this wasn't the case when police attended the wild alcohol-fueled event of about 50 youths, leaving a 17-year-old boy fighting for his life after he was stabbed several times.

It is believed that the event turned into a violent brawl after gatecrashers showed up at the Sydney home.

Two teenagers have ended up in hospital as the result of a backyard brawl at a party in Sydney

One man was treated on the scene before being rushed to RPA with multiple stab wounds to his abdomen

The 16-year-old faces two charges, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, after he was treated for a minor head injury at Concord Hospital.

Last night officers were called to a house on Charles St, Five Dock following reports of a fight in the backyard shortly after 8.40pm.

When police arrived, they found one boy with six or seven times stab wounds to his chest and side and he was rushed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

He remains in a critical but stable condition.

Another teenage boy, also 17, had wounds to his head after reportedly being hit in the head with a bottle and was also taken to RPA.

He was discharged on Saturday.

While Burwood police Inspector Michael Penfold confirmed there was 'drinking at the party' he was unable to clarify whether or not the injured or charged teens were intoxicated.

He said no other substances were involved.

Multiple officers in several cars responded to the call in Sydney's inner west and part of the street was sectioned off with police tape.

Both teenagers were taken to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital though their current condition is unknown

It is understood the 14-year-old girl, who was staying at the dual-level brick home with her grandparents, was having friends over for her birthday.

Police said at least one adult was supervising the home function.

Her grandmother, Christine Varricchio, wasn't at the event but said she allowed the girl to have half a dozen people over but the gathering was gatecrashed.

'She just tried to have a party with pizza and all she bought was lemon squash and strawberry sarsaparilla,'  she told Fairfax Media.

Ms Varricchio said she was returning home from the Blue Mountains when she received a call from her daughter telling her the party had escalated.

The grandmother said she reported the incident to police straight away and the birthday girl is now on her way to Canberra with her father.

It is believed that most of the party-goers were from Concord High School.

A 17-year-old girl, who co-hosted the party, told The Daily Telegraph that she had asked the gatecrasher to leave and went inside to get help from an older boy but when she returned her friends were seriously injured.

'I asked him to leave but he just pushed past me, I went to get help and found my friend lying on the ground bleeding and my other friend had a bottle broken over his head,' she said.

'No one could have prevented it. We just wanted a nice party.

'He's such a nice guy, all I can remember is people running and his mates putting pressure on him with a towel.

'I sat [next to] the boy who was stabbed down and started cleaning him up then the boy who was stabbed started throwing up.

'I think he was stabbed once in the lower chest, three times in the ribs up high an two in the upper chest near his throat.'

Burwood police Inspector Michael Penfold said officers faced chaotic scenes when they arrived at the fracas.

'My understanding is a brawl has broken out and that's how these injuries have occurred,' he said.

Inspector Penfold said there was at least one adult home on Friday night.

Surrounding residents of the usually quiet suburban street heard bottles smashing and people screaming.

Jay Nam looked out her window to see young people on the street yelling at each other.

'Some of the residents came out and tried to get them away from the street,' she said.

Next door neighbour Ed White said the party-goers were about 15 or 16 years old.

'They were really young,' he said.

'There was just lights flashing, sirens and cops up and down the street.'

Inspector Penfold had a warning for parents planning a party for their children.

'One of the main issues is make sure only invited guests attend and adequate security provisions beforehand,' he said.

The 16-year-old was granted conditional bail and will appear at Parramatta Children's Court on June 20.

Anyone with information about the incident should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
