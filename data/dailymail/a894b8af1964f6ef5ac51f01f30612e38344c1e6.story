If you've been looking for a quick way to catch someone's eye, then a new showergel that mimics human hormones could be just what you need.

Escentric Molecules Body Wash contains a dose of Iso E Super, an aromachemical that appears innocuously woody at first sniff but is said to wreak havoc on nearby members of the opposite sex, thanks to its similarity to the smell of human pheromones.

Pheromones are a chemical produced by the body and are designed to subconsciously relay information about fertility to others.

The brainchild of Berlin-based perfumer 
Geza Schoen, the brand was launched in 2006 with two perfumes - 
Escentric 01 and Molecule 01

Along with Iso E Super, the new body wash, which will be sold exclusively at Harvey Nichols, also contains a substance called Energen, a blend of sapindus mukorossi and caesalpinia spinosa.

The former derives from a species of the sapindus, or soapwort, tree in the foothills of the Himalayas and is said to have powerful cleansing properties, although - unfortunately in this case - it can also act as a spermicide.

Caesalpinia spinosa, more commonly known as tara, comes from Peru and has an anti-inflammatory effect.

'Molecule 01 lends an indefinable radiance to the wearer'

The new body wash isn't the first time that Escentric Molecules has used Iso E Super in its products.

The brainchild of Berlin-based 
perfumer Geza Schoen, the brand was launched in 2006 with two perfumes -
Escentric 01 and Molecule 01.

Molecule 01 contains nothing but Iso E Super, while Escentric 01 is a blend of Iso E Super, pink pepper, lime and orris root.

'Molecule
01 lends an indefinable radiance to the wearer,' reveals Schoen in the 
perfume notes on his website.

'In fact, its effect is almost 
pheromonic.'

'The Escentric Molecules range has been a phenomenal success at Harvey Nichols and has established a cult following,' adds Harvey Nichols beauty buyer, Zahra Bishop.

'The range is beautifully and meticulously crafted with mesmerising fragrances. The new Escentric Body Washes in bright bottles with the instantly recognisable cult scents that match exactly the original fragrances are so cleverly and beautifully composed, they are irresistible.'
