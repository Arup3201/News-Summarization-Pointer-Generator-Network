This brave little wildcat took on four lionesses in a battle for its life in a wildlife park in southern Africa.

The tiny cat ferociously bore its teeth and rose its claws in an attempt to fight off the predators as the lionesses crowded around.

In the David versus Goliath attack, the females ganged up on the animal - despite it being 30 times smaller than them.

Tragically the little wildcat lost the battle, but proved that it still 
had some fight left in its body and scratched one of the lionesses 
across the nose before it was killed - causing the predator to lurch back.

The pictures were captured by German photographer Claudia Hopf in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in Botswana.
