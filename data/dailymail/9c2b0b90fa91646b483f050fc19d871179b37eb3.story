A New York waiter had an unexpected bonus on Wednesday night when a diner left him a $1,000 tip on a $114 check.

Michael Shafts never suspected that the couple celebrating a birthday at The Ginger Man in Albany were planning a surprise.

As they were preparing to leave, the wife said quietly to Shafts: 'My husband has done something special for you.'

Thrilled: Credit union worker Michael Shafts, who works part time at the Albany restaurant, was shocked by the generous tip

When Shafts, who works part time at the restaurant alongside his job at a credit union, collected the check, he saw the man had left a personal message and a 878 percent tip.

'It was surreal. I was shaking. I couldnâ€™t feel my legs,' he told the Times Union.

The customers, who have not been identified, have visited the restaurant before but are not regulars at The Ginger Man.

Shafts said the couple had been celebrating the husband's 47th birthday, and had brought a bottle of 47-year-old wine with them to enjoy with their meal.

The man had written on the receipt, 'My birthday present to me. Pay it forward!'

Shafts says he was shocked by the generous tip. 'I shook his hand, I hugged him twice, and I said it was too much, twice.

Unexpected: The owners of The Ginger Man say the $1,000 tip is the largest any staff member has received

'He insisted, twice, that he wanted to do it, that it was legitimate,' Shafts said.

Restaurant owner Julie Bryon said it was the largest tip any of her staff had received.

'I was stunned. I shook my head and said, "I'm sorry can you please open up your book again",' she told All Over Albany.

'He's a very hardworking young man. It couldn't have happened to a nicer person!'

Despite his unexpected windfall, Shafts finished his shift at the restaurant. He also shared more than half the tip with the other servers and kitchen staff.
