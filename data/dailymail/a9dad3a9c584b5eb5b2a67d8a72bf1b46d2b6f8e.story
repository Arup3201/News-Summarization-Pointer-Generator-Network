TV star Mindy Kaling has spoken out about her devastation at the sudden death of her mother from pancreatic cancer in January 2012. 

Speaking in the February issue of Good Housekeeping, on which she features as this month's cover star, the 35-year-old revealed that her beloved mom passed away on the same day as her sitcom, The Mindy Project, was officially picked up for broadcast on US TV network Fox. 

'I'm not superstitious,' Mindy says of the bittersweet memory. 'But I think my mom had some part in it.' 

Mindy, whose real name is Vera Mindy Chokalingam, describes her mother as her 'soulmate' and admits she still can't speak about her without breaking down in tears.

'We're hungry and ambitious people': Sitcom star Mindy Kaling inherited her unwavering determination from her parents

But while she continues to miss her every single day, Mindy credits her mom with instilling in her an unwavering sense of determination and ambition, which she believes has helped her to carve out such a successful career for herself.

'She was very busy, and she did not suffer fools,' the sitcom star explains. 

'Her no-nonsense attitude is the single best thing I got from her. We're hungry, ambitious people. It's a family trait.'

Indeed, Mindy's eponymous title character in her hit series is, she reveals, loosely based on her mother, who was also an ob-gyn. 

Mindy admits that her self confidence and outspoken nature were not always so apparent however. As a child, she recalls being incredibly shy and quiet, 'worried all the time' about what other people would think of her. 

All of that changed when she watched her first episode of Late Night With Conan O'Brien, and became quickly 'obsessed' with the charismatic TV host, staying up late night after night in order to watch his show.

Size matters: The 32-year-old is often held up as a role model for 'curvy' women but admits that she doesn't want her weight to be the most important thing in her life

'Even then, I knew I wanted to be part of that world,' she adds. 'I always thought I was funny before anyone told me I was funny.'

Mindy's first big break came just a few years after she graduated from Dartmouth College, when she was offered an opportunity to write for popular comedy series The Office. She was the only woman working on the team.

But, while her natural flair for writing and unparalleled comedic timing helped to initially launch what is now an incredibly successful career, her rise to the top of the TV industry hasn't been at all easy - and regularly sees Mindy working an 80-hour week. 

Her rigorous working schedule was, at least initially, a welcome distraction from thinking about the loss of her mother however, and ensured that Mindy cemented her name as one of the industry's most successful stars. 

Life in the spotlight has brought with it a few hard lessons however; Mindy is often held up as a role model for 'curvy' women and, as a result, her size and weight are often subjected to a fierce amount of public scrutiny.

The size 8 star admits that she think it is important for women to talk openly about the issues surrounding body image, but is quick to assert that size and weight should be the most important thing in anyone's life - least of all hers.

'I don't think of myself as overweight,' she explains. 'I definitely get hurt when people say mean things about my body. But it's not the most important thing in my life.'

Unsurprisingly, Mindy's love life has also been a topic of much interest and intrigue; there has been much speculation recently that the screenwriter had reunited with her ex-boyfriend - and former Office co-writer - BJ Novak, but Mindy insists that the reports are nothing more than rumors and insists that she doesn't really have the time to focus on relationships and marriage. 

For now, her focus remains on her career. 

'I'd love to direct a romantic comedy someday,' she says. 'There's still so much I want to do. I feel lucky. I keep expanding my dreams.'
