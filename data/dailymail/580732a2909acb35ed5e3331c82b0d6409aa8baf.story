Animal victims of the wildfires that has ravaged the coastal city of Valparaiso in central Chile which has killed at least 15 people and left 11,000 homeless, are being treated for their injuries at a local vet clinic.

Some of the animals are strays, but many were accompanied by their distraught owners who had returned to their neighbourhoods after the still-raging fires destroyed more than 2,500 homes in the city.

Volunteer veterinarians are now trying to treat as many animals as possible, as the population of Valparaiso's slums return to their streets after days of fires, only to discover their houses in ruins.

Victim: A cat gets treated for burns by volunteer veterinarians, who managed to rescue animals from the uncontrolled wildfire still affecting the poorer urban areas of the city of Valparaiso, Chile

Pain of the innocent: A man sits next to his injured dog as it is treated by a volunteer vet following the blaze which has killed at least 15 people in Valparaiso

Casualty: A veterinary nurse tends to young dogs that suffered burns in the fire that has seen 11,000 people evacuated, at a temporary animal hospital in the Chilean city

The
 fires, so hot they created their own fierce winds, consumed a entire neighborhoods on the Valparisian hills. In other districts, some houses stood unscathed 
but remained in danger from glowing embers carried by the shifting 
winds.

'We are looking at 
the largest air operation ever assembled against a fire like this,' 
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said.

She said the blazes had grown to 'dimensions never before seen.'

Chile's
 forestry agency predicted it would take three weeks to completely stamp
 out the fires, which began Saturday in a forested ravine and quickly 
spread into ramshackle housing on one of Valparaiso's 42 hills.

Hot
 dry winds blowing out to sea whipped embers onto other neighborhoods on
 six densely populated hills where people live in poorly constructed 
homes without municipal water or sewer connections, fire hydrants or 
streets wide enough for emergency vehicles.

Volunteers, like these women, are caring for the injured pets and street animals which have been found in areas ravaged by the forest fire over the weekend

Returning home: Volunteers help in clearance work at a hill in Valparaiso, following the fire, which began on 12 April on a forestry road, near Valparaiso's La Polvora road, but quickly expanded to several populated  neighboring hills

On Monday, there was no end in sight. Helicopters were flying without pause, dumping water on hotspots.

Aid
 was flowing in from all over Chile to Valparaiso, where evacuees 
crowded into eight shelters. Hundreds of young volunteers climbed hills 
carrying bottles of water and shovels to help victims search the ruins 
of their homes.

'We're 
going to rebuild right here. Where else would we go?' said Carolina 
Ovando, 22, who lost the humble home she kept with three small children.

Schools were closed, some of them damaged by fires and others jammed with evacuees.

Navy
 officer Julio Leiva said Monday that the death toll rose to 15. Most of
 the bodies were too badly burned to identify without DNA tests, the 
national forensics service said. More than 500 people were treated at 
hospitals, mostly for smoke inhalation.

Bachelet
 coordinated the emergency response with her Cabinet, cancelling a trip 
to Argentina and Uruguay. She asked Chile's neighbors for backup in case
 of other fires, freeing Chilean planes and helicopters to join the 
fleet in Valparaiso.

Argentine
 Foreign Minister Hector Timerman promised to collaborate with rescue 
teams and water-dumping planes. From the Vatican, Pope Francis sent a 
message sharing his prayers.

Bachelet
 put the entire city under military rule, and 5,000 firefighters, 
police, forest rangers, soldiers, sailors and civil defense workers 
joined the response. Cars were banned from streets leading up eight of 
the Valparaiso's hills so emergency vehicles could get through.

Valparaiso is an oceanside city of 250,000 people surrounded by hills that form a natural amphitheater.

The
 compact downtown includes Chile's congress and its second-largest port,
 and the city owes its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site to the 
colorful homes built on slopes so steep that many people commute using 
stairs and cable cars.

But
 what's beautiful on postcards can be dangerous for those who live 
there: Many people have built on land not fit for housing and the poor 
neighborhoods have no municipal water or sewer connections, fire 
hydrants or streets wide enough for emergency vehicles.

'We
 are too vulnerable as a city. We have been the builders and architects 
of our own danger,'Valparaiso Mayor Jorge Castro said Sunday in an 
interview with Chile's 24H channel.

Dense housing: With no municipal water or fire hydrants to use, routes to the blazes blocked by narrow streets jammed with abandoned vehicles and countless embers being stoked, fire crews could do little but watch some neighborhoods burn
