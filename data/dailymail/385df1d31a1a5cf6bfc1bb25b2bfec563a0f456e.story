Smiling alongside his wife and children, this is the heroic doctor who drowned trying to save four teenage surfers caught in a deadly rip current.

Father-of-four Stuart Calder, 52, died along with two other brave adults who ran into the sea to help the group of boys who were struggling in the waves.

His horrified wife is said to have looked on helplessly from the shore as he was dragged away by the current.

Concern: Police are tonight trying to trace the victims' next of kin. The youngsters, described as 'walking wounded', were seen crying as paramedics made desperate efforts to resuscitate the adults

The photo emerged as the RNLI came under criticism for failing to have lifeguards on the beach, with one surfer calling it an ‘avoidable tragedy’.

Mr Calder was a devoted family man and a leading knee surgeon, who would have willingly ‘put himself in danger to save others’, a friend said yesterday.

It is not yet known whether the group of boys involved in the ordeal – all of whom survived – included his own two teenaged sons.

After the alarm was raised on Mawgan Porth beach in Cornwall on Sunday afternoon, Mr Calder joined a 44-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman in the water in a desperate bid to help. But the rescue attempt went tragically wrong.

Eventually the boys – two aged 18, one who was 16, and a 15-year-old – managed to make it back to the shore relatively unscathed.

However the three adults had to be picked up by lifeboat and helicopter and brought back to the beach.

Attempts to revive them failed, and all three died later in hospital. 

Last night the man and woman in their forties, who were from St Austell in Cornwall, had not yet been identified.

But tributes were paid to Mr Calder, an orthopaedic consultant. He was visiting Mawgan Porth – near Newquay – during a holiday away from his £1million detached home in Leeds, where he lived with his wife Clare, also 52.

It is not known whether any of their children – Cosima, 22, Lydia, 20, Hugo, 18, and Milo, 15 – were also on the beach at the time.

Mr Calder was a consultant surgeon at the Yorkshire Knee Clinic in Leeds, and his father-in-law Sir Paul Girolami was chairman of GlaxoSmithKline.

Eric Hanson, a US-based former schoolfriend, told the Mail: ‘Stuart was a respected doctor who was always generous to others.

‘It’s absolutely characteristic of him to put himself in danger to save others, especially children. He was a beloved man.’

He added that the catastrophe had ‘destroyed’ Mr Calder’s elderly parents, who were thought to be travelling to Cornwall yesterday. 

The precise sequence of events which led to the dramatic scene in front of hundreds of beachgoers is still being investigated.

Steve Instance, RNLI lifeguard manager for the South West, said: ‘From the reports we have, one of the people who drowned may have gone in to try to help the others.

‘We believe that the group of children may have been the first to get into difficulty.’

Rip currents are strong, narrow channels of water moving directly away from the shore.

Sometimes wrongly referred to as rip tides, they are formed when a sandbank or other obstruction forces the water into a fast-moving jet – which can reach speeds of up to eight feet per second.

Those caught in one can ultimately die of exhaustion, as they desperately try to swim against it straight back to shore. The currents can also cause swimmers to panic, which only makes the situation worse.

Peter Stansby, a professor of fluid mechanics at the University of Manchester, advises anyone caught in a rip to let themselves to be carried out to sea until the current dissipates.

They should then move to the side, out of its path, and allow themselves to be slowly carried towards the shore by the waves.

Yesterday it came to light that lifeguards had ended their watch at the beach in September. But this policy is set to be reviewed after witnesses spoke of 6ft waves surrounding the stricken teenagers. 

The RNLI said its lifeguard patrols ran from March until the end of the summer. ‘Clear signs’ tell beachgoers that they are in an unprotected area, and emphasise the dangers of strong rip currents.

A spokesman said they always review their commitment to various patrols of British beaches subject to their ‘limited resources’, with another adding that the number of half-term visitors to the beach will be ‘taken into account’.

Yesterday surf instructor Gareth Bradley, 29, who works for Kingsurf surfing school at Mawgan Porth, called for a change in policy. He said: ‘It’s October half-term and a lot of people come on holiday.

‘The lifeguards finish at the end of September but if they … came back on for this week it would make all the difference. It was an avoidable tragedy. Having lifeguards on the beach would have saved lives.’

Last night a floral tribute to those who died could be seen propped up against the dunes.

Stephen Gilbert, Lib Dem MP for St Austell and Newquay, praised the RNLI, but said questions remain over how late in the year beaches should be manned.
