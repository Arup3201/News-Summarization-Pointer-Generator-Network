It has long been suggested that stroking a dog or a cat can be therapeutic for those struck down by illness.

But one man has taken the idea of animal therapy to a whole new level.

Ben Baldwin, who has severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy, is visited in his bedroom by his beloved pet horse, Tiger.

The 22-year-old, who also has learning difficulties, is often so unwell he is unable to go outside to visit Tiger.

So, the piebald cob is brought into his house to see him.

Tiger is able to walk straight into Mr Baldwin’s downstairs bedroom at his family home in Barnsley.

Mr Baldwin’s mother, Liz, 45, says the pair are best friends and have a wonderful connection.

She said: ‘Ben absolutely adores Tiger. His face lights up when he sees him and the smile on his face is priceless.

‘You’d do anything for your children and sometimes when Ben is too ill to go to see Tiger, I bring Tiger into the house.

‘He
 never flinches when Ben has an epileptic fit, he just shows so much 
compassion, love, tenderness and concern as if he understands his 
condition.

‘He leans in for a stroke and nuzzles Ben.’
