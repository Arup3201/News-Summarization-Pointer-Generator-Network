Floyd Mayweather's astonishing run of form betting on the NFL has continued after he picked up a bumper $1.4million (£895,000) payout as the Denver Broncos  beat the New York Jets 31-17, taking his winnings to $3,267,637.36 (£2.03million) in three weeks.

Mayweather, the world's highest paid sportsman, had already banked $1,825,714.28 (£1,13m)  after successfully betting on both the Seattle Seahawks and the Indianapolis Colts to win by more than 7.5 points over the past few weeks.

And the American boxer's luck was in again as he successfully gambled $815,000 (£506,000) on the Denver Broncos to beat the New York Jets by more than 7.5 points on Sunday.

Mayweather also posted the betting slips from his Seahawks and Colts wins to his Instagram account

Sure enough, the Broncos came through to win 31-17 as Peyton Manning's three touchdown passes helped his side to victory.

The margin of victory required for Mayweather was only secured in the last minute though as Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib picked off Jets quarterback Geno Smith and returned the ball 22 yards for a touchdown.

Naturally the Money Man took to Instagram to celebrate his success - posting his betting slip - as he did with his Seahawks and Colts successes.

Mayweather laid his latest bet with  CG Technology at the M Resort in Las Vegas, and the company's vice president of race and sports, Jason Simbal, confirmed the bet to ESPN.

'Floyd didn't watch the game here,' Simbal said, 'but he certainly showed up shortly thereafter to cash.'
