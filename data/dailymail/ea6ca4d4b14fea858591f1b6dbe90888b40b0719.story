One misdirected email led an American writer to fall in love with and marry a British archaeologist. 

Adele Geraghty, 61, sent a message containing a writing sample to lecturer Phil Sidebottom, 66, when his email address was wrongly given as a contact in a call for submissions in her local newspaper. 

The simple mistake led her on an incredible journey to a new life with Phil in Sheffield, more than 3,000 miles away from her native Brooklyn, New York.

She said: 'It's amazing to think how different our lives would have been, were it not for the incorrectly printed email address. And not just our lives, but our children's lives, and the lives of our friends.' 

The advert in newspaper should have directed writers to submit their work to an email address beginning 'author45', but instead gave the address as 'author54' - Phil's personal account. 

Adele recalled: 'I received a reply the next day.

'It was from Phil. He said he was not the person I was seeking, and was worried that his email had been given out illegally because he received a few emails from people he didn't know. 

'I thought it was only polite to offer a full apology, and a full explanation. I think he was quite impressed that I had taken the time to write back to him properly, and that began a conversation.' 

Intrigued, Adele looked up Phil online and discovered he was an archaeology lecturer at the University of Sheffield.

The couple soon struck up an intense cyber friendship, chatting online for up to five hours a day, swapping to voice messaging when Phil bought a computer with a microphone. 

Adele said: 'We talked about everything - our families, what we studied at university, and how we both liked to write. We could both express ourselves clearly, which allowed us to become in tune with one another. It was as if we were learning everything about each other.' 

Then, seven months after Adele's first email, Phil suffered a devastating heart attack. The setback only strengthened the bond between them. 

Adele said: 'I waited by my computer all night for an email from him. In hospital, Phil asked where he could get internet access so he could send me a message to reassure me that he was alright. 

'Later that month, I suffered an injury to my back. Even though I couldn't move, I asked my son push my bed closer to my desk so I could keep in contact with him.' 

Finally Adele, who has six children from a marriage which ended in divorce in 1985, decided to take the plunge and visit England for the first time.

She said: 'My son thought I had lost my mind. He was worried that my relationship wasn't real, and that I was setting myself up to be scammed. My daughter was more enthusiastic - she thought it was a great romantic adventure.' 

Phil, who has an adult son and daughter, was in the process of getting divorced when Adele arrived at Heathrow airport. 

He said: 'I wondered whether we would recognise each other - whether Adele would be left to wander around the airport lost. 

'As soon as I saw her, I stood there beaming. I couldn't believe she was actually real.' 

Adele said: 'It might be cliche, but it was love at first sight. He was even better looking than he was in pictures on the internet.'

Adele emigrated to England permanently in 2005 and the pair married in 2007. In September 2012, Adele realised a dream when she became a naturalised UK citizen. 

She said: 'I feel at home in Yorkshire. My family emigrated to America from there in the 19th century, and even up until the 1930s members of my family were speaking with British accents.

'To become a UK citizen was a very special moment in my life.' 

The couple have launched a publishing venture combining their love of literature and archaeology. They have named their independent publishing house 'Between These Shores', to reflect their amazing love story. A collection of Adele's work, entitled 'Skywriting in the Minor Key' was published in late 2010. 

Reflecting on the twist of fate which brought her together with her husband, Adele said: 'Were it not for those two numbers in the email address being swapped, none of this would have happened. 

'It was such a small mistake, but it's had an enormous effect. I'm so glad it happened.'
