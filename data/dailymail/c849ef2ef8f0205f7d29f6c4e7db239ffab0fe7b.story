Jose Mourinho was so exasperated with the officiating of Phil Dowd that he allegedly screamed: ‘You’re too fat to referee.’

The Chelsea manager is said to have launched the astonishing attack against the 51-year-old following defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on New Year’s Day, reports the Mirror.

Spurs went on to beat Mourinho’s side 5-3 at White Hart Lane, with the Portuguese flabbergasted at the number of decisions to go against them.

‘You’re too fat to referee, you should retire,’ Mourinho is said to have shouted. ‘You’ve cost us.’

Dowd opted not to award Chelsea a penalty for handball when they were leading early on, an event which Mourinho felt changed the game.

The pair are said to have made up after the event, which saw Mourinho allow his emotions to run away with him in the tunnel.

But he went on afterwards, claiming Dowd was ‘too slow’ in the post-match press conference.

Mourinho has already been slapped with a misconduct charge by the Football Association for claiming there is a ‘campaign’ against the Premier League leaders.

Mourinho has reportedly now made up with Dowd, saying his emotions got the better of him at the time

He has until 6pm on Tuesday to appeal the charge and is set to contest it.

The remarks came after the 1-1 draw away at Southampton on December 28 – Mourinho losing control when Anthony Taylor booked Cesc Fabregas for simulation when the midfielder looked as if he’d been tripped.

‘There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don’t know why there is this campaign and I do not care. Everybody knows it was a penalty,’ he said.

An FA statement last week read: ‘It is alleged his remarks constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a referee or referees and/or bring the game into disrepute.’

Mourinho chose not to speak to the media after the weekend win against Newcastle.
