A Pakistan-born businessman - who last year failed in his bid to buy an NFL team - has struck it second time lucky with the $760 million purchase of the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Shahid 'Shad' Khan made headlines in 2010 when he was outmanoeuvred in the buying of St Louis Rams by minority owner Stan Kroenke.

Kroenke - who also owns a majority stake in English Premier League soccer team Arsenal - exercised an option giving him matching rights on any outside bids.

But 61-year-old Illinois-based entrepreneur Khan's dream of having his very own franchise has now come true - as he takes over from Wayne Weaver as sole owner.

He has reportedly used $350 million of debt to finance the deal. Weaver said this week: 'We had to have an exit strategy. It's a little bittersweet that it's come as soon as it has.'

Khan, who will formally address the press on Monday before the team's game against the San Diego Chargers, will officially take over at the end of the season.

And, despite rumours he was thinking of moving the team from its base in northern Florida to Los Angeles, reports suggests he will keep the team in Jacksonville.

At the same time, general manager Gene Smith has had his contract extended, while head coach Jack Del Rio, who has run the team since 2003, has been fired. Mel Tucker will take over in his place.

If the deal is approved by the league, the Pakistan-born U.S. citizen will become the first minority to have a controlling owner of an NFL team.

Born in Pakistan, moved to the U.S. aged 16 - now aged 61, he is married to Ann Khan.

A federal review of Khan's tax returns from 1999 to 2003 identified five transactions 'potentially abusive tax shelters'

Documents filed in court alleged he tried to shelter $250 million to cut tax liability by $85 million

Khan later told the The News-Gazette newspaper in Illinois he had fully paid the money in dispute, which he said was about $68 million.

He also said he hoped to recover the money through litigation - a lawsuit by Khan against the IRS is still pending in U.S. Tax Court

He is also pursuing suits against his former financial advisers who helped set up the tax shelters

Weaver said: 'This gentleman is absolutely the American story. He's going to buy a home here in Jacksonville. He's going to spend time here in Jacksonville.

'He's going to keep the Jaguars management group intact. He's keeping the Jaguars staff intact.

'He has a great admiration for what we've been able to accomplish here and the way we run our business here so he's keeping all that intact.

'This is going to be a team that is going to be in Jacksonville many years into the future. It's going to see my grandson grow up as a Jaguars fan and many other kids as well.

'My dream is to see this team be successful in Jacksonville and I found an owner who has that commitment and has that passion.'

Although Khan has initially said he will keep the team in Jacksonville, there is nothing written in the deal which legally binds him to do so.

Weaver added: 'It's pretty hard to put something in writing saying you have to do something, but you have to trust individuals' integrity and I have no doubt that Shahid is going to do what he plans to do.

'I had to be comfortable that his plan was to keep the team in Jacksonville. There's not a doubt in my mind that this team will be in Jacksonville.

'I have enough confidence in my trust in human nature in people I've gotten to know over a long period of time, that when they tell you something, you can depend on it.

'It's hard to write something that forces somebody to say you're going to keep the team here.

'The only reason I would have ever moved the team is if I couldn't make it sustain itself here and we've been able to do that and there's no reason Shahid won't be able to do that.'

Khan, who is the owner of the automobile parts manufacturer Flex-N-Gate, which Forbes says has an annual revenue of $2.57 billion, released the following statement after Weaver's press conference.

He said: 'I am honoured to have recently signed an agreement with Wayne Weaver and his partners to purchase the Jacksonville Jaguars.

'I have known Wayne for some time and have long admired his spirit, which nearly 20 years ago - against all odds - helped make the Jaguars and the National Football League a reality for Jacksonville and North Florida.

'Wayne's legacy will be lasting, and I will always be grateful for Wayne's trust and confidence in my commitment to the Jaguars, the NFL and the people of the Jacksonville community.'
