Some 45 people were killed yesterday - including at least 12 children - as government forces widened a bombing campaign in rebel-held areas of Syria, activists said.

One strike hit Syria's largest city of Aleppo, while another on the Turkish border town of Azaz was claimed to be the latest attack using powerful-but-inaccurate ‘barrel bombs’ on the northern region.

The Azaz attack suggests the Government is expanding its targets a week after it began a heavy air offensive against Aleppo on December 15, dropping the bombs on rebel-held areas from helicopters.

Activists said 15 people were killed in the Azaz strike, while it was reported that air raids on the Aleppo areas of Sukkari, Maadi, Marjeh and Nairab left at least 30 people including 12 children dead.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll could rise. On Sunday, 65 were killed near an Aleppo marketplace in one of the air campaign’s bloodiest days, activists said.

Rami Abdurrahman from the Observatory said that air raids on Aleppo have killed at least 301 people including 87 children, 30 women and nearly 30 opposition fighters since mid-December.

But that figure did not include those reported killed yesterday. The aid group Doctors Without Borders has said the bombs killed at least 189 people and wounded 879 in the first four days alone.

Concern: The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll from the strikes could rise

Highly dangerous: Barrel bombs are crude devices filled with explosives and fuel that are wildly inaccurate

Saved: The barrel bombs often land near schools and market places, causing massive damage on impact

Climbing out: The Syrian Government has not commented on the use of the crude weapons in attacks

Claim: Syrian President Bashar Assad says his army is fighting 'terrorists' backed by foreign states

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘I am deeply concerned at the escalating level of violence in Syria.

Foreign Secretary William Hague

‘I
 condemn the use of brutal and indiscriminate weapons in 
densely-populated civilian areas, such as we have seen in Aleppo in 
recent days.’

The main 
Western-backed Syrian opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, 
warned that if the bombing campaign against Aleppo continues it will not
 take part in UN-sponsored peace talks.

The
 group's Secretary General Badr Jamous was quoted in a coalition 
statement as saying they will boycott the talks planned for January 22 
in Switzerland if the air raids do not stop.

Helping hand: People are rescued from buildings after Syrian army helicopters dropped 'barrel bombs'

Shocking data: Air raids on Aleppo have killed at least 301 people including 87 children since mid-December

Saved: A trapped person is rescued from a building after 'barrel bombs' were dropped yesterday in Aleppo

Fears: Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was 'deeply concerned at the escalating level of violence in Syria'

Barrel bombs are crude devices filled 
with explosives and fuel that are wildly inaccurate - often landing near
 schools and market places, causing massive damage on impact.

The Government has not commented on the use of the crude weapons, nor on the intensified strikes over Aleppo.

But
 the timing suggests that President Bashar Assad could be trying to 
strengthen his position a month ahead of planned peace talks in 
Switzerland.

In the capital
 Damascus, President Assad received an Australian delegation telling 
them his government is fighting extremists who might strike anywhere in 
the world, the state media said.

The Syrian Arab News Agency said the delegation included academics, researchers and activists.

‘What is happening in Syria and the region in general affects the whole world,’ SANA quoted Assad as telling the delegation.

‘The country is facing fanatic takfiri ideology that has no borders. It is an epidemic that could strike anytime and anywhere.’

The term ‘takfiri’ is usually applied to hard-liners who consider other Muslims to be infidels.

President Assad said in the past that fighters from more than 80 countries have come to Syria to fight against his forces. He says his army is fighting ‘terrorists’ backed by foreign states.
