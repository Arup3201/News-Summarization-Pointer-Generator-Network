Rory McIlroy was seen celebrating his victory at The Open at a club in Liverpool with a mystery brunette beauty - fuelling speculation about his recent relationship with an Irish model.

The jubilant golfer hit the trendy Empire Club with a raven-haired beauty - who bears an incredible resemblance to be Nadia Forde, a 25 year-old lingerie model.

The pair are believed to be in a budding romance and their relationship is even tipped to have been the driving force behind McIlroy’s triumph yesterday.

After being introduced by mutual friends last year, the pair have remained tight-lipped about the nature of their relationship.

Meanwhile McIlroy’s ex-fiancee,  Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, 24, seems to be thriving on being a single woman after winning the Istanbul Cup yesterday – her first title of the year.

McIlroy and Miss Forde, 25, certainly seem to be getting closer. He missed a practice session before the Open when he learnt that Miss Forde had been involved in a car crash last weekend.

Her Fiat 500 Abarth flipped six times before crashing into the central reservation on the M40 in Warwickshire when she was driving from London to Manchester.

She suffered only minor bruising and a bump to her head.

After the crash, McIlroy said: ‘If anyone is involved in a car crash you are glad to see they are OK but yeah, obviously, it was a pretty scary incident.’

The golfer, who split from Miss Wozniacki in May after the couple sent out their wedding invitations, has been reluctant to answer questions about any potential new romance.

But after he was spotted getting close to Miss Forde in a Dublin bar earlier this month, he rediscovered the kind of golfing form which propelled him to the top of the world rankings two years ago.

Miss Forde is a model, actress and singer who regularly appears on Irish television.

She has previously described McIlroy as a ‘lovely guy’, although she too has been coy about the nature of their relationship.

‘The bottom line with me and Rory is we have mutual friends who introduced us and we’ve been in each other’s company,’ she said.

When asked if the golfer was her type she replied: ‘I don’t really have a type, to be honest with you.’

Miss Forde said her ideal man would be ‘a bit of a cheeky chappie who makes me laugh ... a guy with a twinkle in his eye’.

She added: ‘For me it’s not about looks. It’s about the person. I think whoever I end up with I will be friends with first.

‘The important thing is having somebody with ambition and drive who is hard-working. That for me is a massive turn-on.’

The model did not attend the Open at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, in Hoylake, the Wirral, despite speculation that she might make an appearance.
