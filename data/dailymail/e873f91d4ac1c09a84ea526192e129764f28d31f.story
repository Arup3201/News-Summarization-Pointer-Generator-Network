A drunk driver wept in court today as he admitted killing his sister and her fiancé in a car crash - leaving his baby nephew as an orphan.

Corey Davies, 20, had been drinking when he took Raquel Davies, 23, and 25-year-old Lee Jenkins out for a spin in his new BMW convertible near Tonyrefail in south Wales.

He tried to overtake a bus on a winding A road, causing the white car to spin off the road and flip onto its roof.

Miss Davies and Mr Jenkins died instantly because the BMW's soft-top gave them no protection, while Davies escaped unscathed.

The engaged couple's nine-week-old son, Harley, was left orphaned by their deaths.

Now,
 Davies has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing death by dangerous 
driving at Cardiff Crown Court via videolink from HMP Cardiff.

Gareth
 James, prosecuting, told the court that Davies had 'excess alcohol' in 
system when he tried to overtake the bus last month.

Scene: Davies, 20, had been drinking when he took his sister and Mr Jenkins out for a spin in his new BMW on the A4093 (pictured) near the village of Gilfach Goch in south Wales. He crashed after trying to overtake a bus

He
 said CCTV from inside the public vehicle showed the defendant attempting to overtake it, before crashing into a ditch on the 
A4093 near the village of Gilfach Goch.

He added that Davies, from Porth, Rhondda, had then 'left the scene'.

Speaking
 last month, a family spokesman for Miss Davies said: 'She was perfect 
in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son.

'She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out. Sheloved her fiancé immensely.'

Case: Davies today pleaded guilty to two charges of causing death by dangerous driving at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) via videolink from HMP Cardiff. He will be sentenced at the court at a later date

Meanwhile,
 Mr Jenkins's family said in a statement: 'He loved his fiancée Raquel 
dearly and was enjoying being a new dad to Harley who is just nine weeks
 old.

'Lee was a keen and talented footballer when he was younger. We are heartbroken at the loss of Lee and will cherish all the great times and wonderful memories he gave us.'

Specially-trained South Wales Police officers are providing support to both families.

Davies will be sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court at a later date.
