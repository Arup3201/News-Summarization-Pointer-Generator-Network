'Hot convict' Jeremy Meeks has proved himself a model prisoner. 

Despite being behind bars in California for felony possession of a firearm, the 30-year-old has been signed by talent agency, White Cross Management.

Meeks' baby-blue eyes, razor-sharp cheekbones and chiseled jawline first caught the public's attention when his mugshot was posted last year on the Stockton Police Department's Facebook page.

Meeks gave a jailhouse interview last June in which he said he was flattered by the attention but wanted to clear his name

Following Meeks' signing to the talent management company, ABC reported last week that he said: 'I'm in a place where I will be able to provide for my family and really change my life. 

'I never thought that everyone in the world would recognize me for my looks, so I feel extremely blessed and very thankful.'

Meeks was convicted in federal court last month of one felony count of possession of a firearm after being arrested in June 2014.

The judge sentenced him to 27 months in prison and 500 hours in the Bureau of Prisons Substance Abuse Treatment Program. 

The 30-year-old is hoping for an early release in November.

The original mugshot has now gained hundreds of thousands of likes and spawned dozens of memes, even earning Meeks nicknames such as 'Hotty McMug Shot' and 'Mugshot McDreamy'. 

White Cross Management, based in New York and LA, has dozens of actor-models signed to its books. 

The firm confirmed to Daily Mail Online on Tuesday that they had signed Weeks and were his only representation.
