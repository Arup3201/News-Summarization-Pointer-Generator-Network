The closest thing to being 'free as a bird' is flying a plane upside down according to Victorian pilot Jeremy Miller.

Mr Miller runs a flying school in Lethbridge, west of Melbourne, and offers joy flights, basic flying and specialises in daring aerobatics.

The 31-year-old pilot said there was no better feeling than freedom of flying a plane through the air. 'Aerobatics has always been a passion of mine, I've always been fascinated by it,' he said.

After running an aerobatics school in Western Australia for about four years, Mr Miller decided to set up his own school in Victoria in 2010, where he said there was a big aviation community.

On an afternoon about three weeks ago, Mr Miller was photographed flying a 2009 super decathlon aircraft ahead of the Queensland Aerobatics Championships in Queensland in August, which many of his students will compete in.

In one of his most daring stunts, Mr Miller flies his plane upside down for about two minutes - the longest the aircraft allows. 'The sensation, it's like being free - you're not really limited,' he said.

'A aircraft, it's a 3D machine and aerobatics explores that third dimension. Positive g-force can pull you down into your seat, negative g-force (when upside down) - it's like doing a handstand and blood rushing to your head.

'You feel like you're coming out of your seat. I love the freedom it gives you.'

Mr Miller said aerobatics was limitless and he was often surprised by some of the tricks he sees

The Victorian pilot said the only way to fully appreciate the thrill of the air was to experience first-hand

Yet Mr Miller admitted the thought of flying upside down was not for everyone, with some of his students initially 'apprehensive' about the idea.

'Once they have their first few goes, they really start getting into it and getting enthusiastic,' he said.

'It's one of those things, it's difficult to describe if you haven't experienced it. The best way I explain itÂ  is telling people to come and experience it for themselves.

'We've all seen the movie Top Gun, but until you actually experience it, you really don't know what to expect.

'Aerobatics is an open book, you're only limited by your own creativity, some of the things you see, you don't think it's possible.'

Mr Miller starting learning to fly at just 14 years old and got his restricted pilots license when he was 16

Learning to fly at 14, Mr Miller got his restricted pilot's license at 16, before finishing high school.

He said flying ran through his blood. 'My grandfather flew in World War II, I have some uncles who are pilots...It was always something I wanted to do and I love vintage aircraft.'

Working as a pilot since 2001, with more than 10 years experience, Mr Miller has been able to perfect his own aerobatic skills and regularly performs at air displays across Australia.

He has about up to 50 students at his flying school, with about 30 active, and Mr Miller said many now competed at aerobatic competitions around the country.
