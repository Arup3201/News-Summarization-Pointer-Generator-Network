A farmer who caught national attention after shooting a burglar dead at his house in 1999 says he will not move back to his former home because he fears he could kill again.

Tony Martin became a household name after he killed 16-year-old Fred Barras and seriously injured Brendan Fearon, then 28, with a shotgun after the pair broke into his farmhouse.

Martin was originally convicted of murder, causing national controversy, but in 2001 the charge was reduced to manslaughter and his sentence was cut to five years by the Appeal Court.

Mr Martin was jailed for life in 2000 for the murder of Fred Barras, 16, at this farm in Norfolk causing nation outcry. In 2001 the charge was reduced to manslaughter and in 2003 he was released

Yesterday he said he has still not moved back into his former home at Emneth because he fears history may repeat itself.

He said: 'If I was in Bleak House and someone came in again, then I'm not going to just stand there and let him hurt me. I'm going to act.

'That's one of the reasons I don't want to go back there, because it could happen again.'

Mr Martin added that he has been living with friends and in hotels since his release from prison in 2003, and blasted his original sentence as 'preposterous'.

He said: 'The whole thing that happened to me in simple terms is preposterous. I don't think I'll ever go back and live at Bleak House.

'I have been down the farm this morning and I had a walk around the garden to cut a few roses. I wouldn't call this place a home anymore, it is just a place to visit. It is a time that place forgot.

'I looked at it last night and it is encased in steel and flooded with water. It looks like the Everglades.

'I just live anywhere, I sleep anywhere. If I go up north to a farm show then I will just stay in my car. I live a little bit like Bonnie Prince Charlie and go from place to place. I have very kind friends.'

Mr Martin also called for the legalisation of guns and said there need to be tougher laws allowing people to protect their homes.

His comments come a week after law professor Paul Kohler, 55, was savagely beaten on the doorstep of his Wimbledon home after tackling four masked raiders.

Mr Martin also called for the legalisation of guns, saying that people should have an 'infallible' right to protect themselves in their own homes

He also spoke about the case of law professor Paul Kohler who was savagely beaten as he defended his house in Wimbledon, saying if the law professor had a gun 'things would have been different'

Mr Kohler was left with a face covered in bruises after the attack and fears for the sight in one of his eyes after the attack.

Speaking about the case, Mr Martin said: 'I think it is just hypocrisy that a man can't go to any length to protect himself. You need to be safe in your own house with impunity.

'That law professor who got beaten up in his own home, if he had something like a gun in that house he could have picked it up and things would have been different.'

20 August 1999: Police are called to remote Bleak House in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, after 16-year-old Fred Barras is shot dead. Brendan Fearon,28, his friend and accomplice, is taken to hospital with wounds to his legs.

10 April 2000: Martin denies murdering Barras and attempting to murder Fearon, wounding Fearon with intent to cause injury and possessing a Winchester pump-action shotgun with intent to endanger life. He admits not having a firearms licence.

19 April 2000: Martin is jailed for life for the murder of Fred Barras, with 10 years to run concurrently for the wounding offence and 12 months for possession of an illegal firearm. 

29 August 2000: Martin launches an appeal against his murder conviction after replacing his legal team, claiming that his account was not properly put forward at his trial.

10 August 2001: Fearon is freed from prison.

30 October 2001: Martin's murder conviction is reduced to manslaughter, and his 10-year sentence for wounding Fearon is cut to three years, to run concurrently.
