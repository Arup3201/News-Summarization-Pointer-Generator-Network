Four teenagers from Queens, New York are dead after an early morning car crash on a notorious section of road, known as ‘Dead Man’s Curve’, which ripped their vehicle in two.

State police say 17-year-old Joseph Beer, who only had a learner's permit, lost control of the car that his parents just bought for him on the westbound lanes of the Southern State Parkway just before 4 a.m. on Monday.

The black 2012 Subaru Imprezza crossed two lanes of traffic, hit the shoulder and slammed into several trees.

All five occupants were thrown from the car. Two bodies were found 30 feet away on the parkway, one in a brush near the vehicle and the fourth victim was found beside the destroyed mangled car.

When police and fire officials arrived, Beer was found wandering the scene in a daze, attempting to use the light from his cell phone to look for survivors. He was taken to nearby Winthrop Hospital in Long Island.

All four of Beer’s passengers were killed instantly and pronounced dead at the scene. They were Peter Anthony, Chris Khan, Neil Rajaba and Darian Ramnarine - all aged 18.

Drivers with learner permits are 
prohibited from driving unless accompanied by a supervising driver, age 
21 or older, who has a valid license, according to the state Department 
of Motor Vehicles.

As a 17-year-old with only a learner’s 
permit, Beer shouldn't have been driving without a 
licensed driver - 21 or over - in the car. He had been given the car as a present from his parents for graduating early from hill school.

The victim's belongings including an iPad case, school textbooks, sneakers, cell phones and two backpacks were found strewn around the accident scene.

Dozens of friends of the boys made a pilgrimage to the crash site during Monday to 
mourn their loss, lit candles and leave bouquets of flowers out of respect for their 
lost friends.

Local emergency services refer to the site of the accident as 'Dead Man's Curve' because serious accidents occur there so frequently.

The area is a triple threat to motorists, who face an incline, a curve and a blind spot.

'This is a notorious area for car crashes,' Lakeview Fire Chief Heather Senti told the New York Post. 'If I had to guess from the wreckage, they were going quite fast.'
