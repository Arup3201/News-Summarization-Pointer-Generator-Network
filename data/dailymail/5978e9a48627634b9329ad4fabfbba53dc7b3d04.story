David Cameron will push for Russia to be stripped of its right to host the 2018 World Cup as part of a sanctions threat against Vladmir Putin's deployment of troops in Ukraine.

Alongside various officials from across the EU, the British Prime Minister is working on a list of symbolic policies to isolate the Russian President until he draws an end to the conflict.

The fighting in eastern Ukraine between the military and Russian-backed separatists has left almost 2,600 people dead, according to UN figures, and Cameron is ready to put the case forwards to FIFA.

'The idea of taking the World Cup away from Russia has come up in talks between European leaders,' said one senior European diplomat to The Telegraph.

'Britain especially has pushed it as a way of taking broader and more imaginative measures against Russia.'

NATO said this week Moscow has slipped at least 1,000 Russian soldiers and much heavy weaponry into Ukraine.

There have also been recent calls for Russia to be stripped of its first Formula One Grand Prix, which is due to take place in Sochi in October.
