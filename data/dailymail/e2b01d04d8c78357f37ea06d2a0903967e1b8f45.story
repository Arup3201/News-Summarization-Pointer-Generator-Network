She's become known for her controversial comments during her participation in debates on This Morning.

But on Tuesday, Katie Hopkins finally met her match - after facing off against Peaches Geldof in a discussion about attachment parenting.

Despite aiming several low blows at Peaches, including referencing a picture of Peaches' son Astala falling out of his pram while the star was on the phone, Katie's argument couldn't stand up to Peaches' comments about the principles of AP.

'The panto witch has finally met her match!' Peaches Geldof shared her joy after winning a debate on attachment parenting against Katie Hopkins on This Morning on Tuesday

Following the incredibly heated debate, Peaches shared a picture of herself and a very sullen-looking Katie on Twitter, writing: 'I think we all know who won. She was quaking in her Sloanie old 
boots. The panto witch finally met her match!'

She later added: 'Just saw the Hopkins exiting the This Morning studios with her tail between her legs and a traumatised expression on her face. Finally!!'

Katie had earlier let rip at mother-of-two Peaches, insisting that her decision to stick to the often controversial movement to raise sons Astala and Phaedra meant that she is a bad mother.

Her argument reached a new low when she referenced the now infamous picture of Astala falling out of his pram, saying: 'She likes attachment parenting until her baby is on the pavement.'

Heated: Katie and Peaches had a very lively debate about attachment parenting

Defending her corner: Peaches did her utmost to explain the reasons as to why she follows the principles of attachment parenting, while Katie contended otherwise

But Katie's comment didn't go down too well with This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby stepped in to defend Peaches.

Phillip said: 'We've all done that. My daughter fell out of her carry chair when I was looking after her once.'

And Peaches replied: 'At least I'm there for my children and not slagging them off in the press, Katie.'

The lively debate began with Peaches explaining the principles of attachment parenting to Holly, Phillip and Katie.

Almost coming to blows: Peaches refused to let Katie speak during the debate

Stepping in: The pair made no secret of their out-and-out dislike of each other on the show

'Whatever she says is meaningless': Peaches labelled Katie a 'rent-a-gob' during the show

She said: 'It's sad to me that 
this has a name because all it is is a return to instinctive parenting. I
 follow the 7 Bs of attachment parenting - birth bonding, breastfeeding,
 babywearing, bedding close to baby, belief in the language value of 
your babyâ€™s cry, beware of baby trainers and balance.'

But Peaches added that while the principles of AP can be as loose or as strict as you like, she does have a routine with her two boys.

She said: 'I have a 
routine with my child, we have a loose feeding schedule, and they have a
 really strict bed time because there are boundaries.

'It's
 really not about strict rules - you can pick and choose what you like 
about it, it's all inclusive. you can really mix and match.'

The post that started it all: Peaches' rage stemmed from Katie sharing this picture and comment about the incident which saw her son Astala fall out of his pram

Peaches was then asked about the fact that her husband Tom Cohen sleeps in a separate bed while she sleeps with the children.

She
 said: 'With my family it's because I have two babies under 2. One is 17
 months and one is 7 months. We have a bed that is 9ft wide because when
 you sleep with your baby you have to be safe.'

When
 pressed about how the sleeping arrangements affect her sex life, 
Peaches replied: 'I have two babies under two so obviously I am doing 
something in the bedroom.

Hold on a minute: Katie was unimpressed when Peaches jumped in with her own comments as she was speaking

'Whatever she says is meaningless': Peaches dismissed Katie's remarks without a second thought

'Just
 because I sleep in bed with my babies doesn't mean I'm in bed with them
 24/7. They go to bed at 7, but I don't go to bed at 7. We go to another
 bedroom in the house and watch television or do other things couples 
do.

'I'm 24 and my husband is 23, we obviously like being intimate with each other!'

Phillip
 and Holly then gave Katie chance to chime in, with the former 
Apprentice star saying: 'It's all a bit "knit your own Birkenstocks" for
 me. AP is just one step away from CR-AP parenting.'

The many faces of Katie Hopkins: The presenter let her frustration show on her face

Head in hands: Peaches also appeared to be finding it frustrating when Katie wouldn't listen to her points

At least she's making herself laugh: Katie aimed several low blows at Peaches during the debate

But Peaches was unwilling to let Katie speak, insisting: 'Whatever you say is meaningless', before adding to Phillip and Holly: 'She's just a rent-a-gob.'

Given another chance to step in on the debate, Katie said: 'I
 think it's really important that mums are mums and that they are in 
control. AP parents thinks it's important that you're there straight 
away if the baby cries,

'But
 I think it's important to see that as a mother you put you baby down to
 sleep and if they want to cry, then they should go for it.'

On
 the issue of baby wearing, which sees mothers hold their children close
 to them via a sling, Katie said: 'I wear a handbag, I don't wear a 
baby.

'You see these women 
with 15 metres worth of Indian print fabric, it's always Indian print, 
wrapped around their body and somewhere in there there's a mewling baby.'

Victory! Peaches looked delighted as she posed up outside the ITV studios before heading home

Just about smiling: Katie's exit appearance was less cheery than Peaches'

But Peaches contended: 'It's been going on for generations since mothers were in caves.

For
 years and years, especially in less economically developed countries, mothers sleep with 
their babies and have a wildly less instance of mental health problems and
 health problems in general.

The reason is because they are doing this thing that says to your baby, "I love you, I'm there for you".'

When Katie attempted to step in once 
again, Peaches responded: 'This is a prime example of someone who wasn't
 attachment parented when she was growing up.

'This is someone who goes on the media to slag off other women and slag off her own children.'

Given the last five seconds to conclude her argument, Katie said: 'It's important to let your babies live their lives.

'Attachment parents are crap parents.'

The row between Peaches and Katie had started before they even arrived at This Morning.

On
 Twitter on Tuesday morning, Katie had attempted to antagonise Peaches 
by sharing a picture of Astala falling out of his pram, writing: 'Peaches believes in attachment parenting. Attached to a phone that is...'

However, following Katie's tweet, Peaches was quick to respond, blasting her for her accusation.

She wrote: 'I
 don't even want to reply to Katie Hopkins desperate, incessant tweeting
 because it feeds her insatiable lust for recognition. However her 
posting low blows like a picture of my son falling from his pram when I 
tripped over a crack in a pavement has warranted at least a few 
responses from me.

'This is the woman who wrote of a disabled sporting 
hero that she hoped that she would roll over nails on her way to a TV 
appearance. This is the woman who hates women, ethnic minorities, anyone
 with less money, anyone who dares point out the glaringly obvious about her 
own children on a regular basis.'

Peaches most catty barb came when she commented: 'I wouldn't be surprised if she had a 
shrivelled old pair of balls under that 1980s sloaney tweed skirt of 
hers. All the better to castrate her with.'
