A giant poster of a girl who lost both her parents in a drone strike has been attached to a field in Pakistan by artists looking to put an innocent face to the deadly attacks.

The picture, designed to be captured by satellites, was set up in a village in the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, which is close to the border with Afghanistan.

Residents of the tribal community say attacks by pilotless aircraft happen daily, despite the American government downplaying the number of civilian deaths they cause.

Amnesty International suggest 900 people have been killed by strikes in Pakistan since 2004, including 330 children.

A representative for the group behind the project said: 'Although there is awareness for drone attacks, it’s rarely humanized.'

In an email to Yahoo News they added: 'This installation is our attempt at showing that.'

The unidentified girl is said to have lost her two siblings along with both her parents in an attack.

Members of Not A Bug Splat come from a number of countries including the United States, France and Pakistan.

Aims: The group behind the installation of the giant poster, called Not a Bug Splat, say they wanted to put a face on the daily drone strikes that occur in the tribal reason

In a post on their website, they said: 'In military slang, Predator drone operators often refer to kills as 'bug splats' since viewing the body through a grainy video image gives the sense of an insect being crushed.'

'To challenge this insensitivity as well as raise awareness of civilian casualties, an artist collective installed a massive portrait facing up in the heavily bombed Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa region of Pakistan, where drone attacks regularly occur.

'Now, when viewed by a drone camera, what an operator sees on his screen is not an anonymous dot on the landscape, but an innocent child victim’s face.'

They also want the image to become part of mapping sites.

Satellites: The artists also want the image to be part of mapping sites
