It was a stronghold built by the Normans to help defend England from rebellious northerners and marauding Scots, but 11th century Durham Castle now faces another battle - against damp.

Durham University, responsible for the upkeep of the grand monument, hopes to root out the damp in the oldest parts of the castle.

The Norman Chapel, which is almost 1,000 years old, is one of the worst affected sections of the former bishop's palace and could undergo vital work to dry it out.

Durham University, responsible for the castle's upkeep, hopes to carry out work to eradicate the damp

The university has submitted proposals to Durham Council and hopes to eradicate the damp by building a retaining wall.

Trevar Armour, director of estates and buildings at Durham University said: 'There is currently some dampness affecting the walls of the Norman Chapel at Durham Castle.

'As part of the maintenance of this historic building, the University plans to excavate around the external wall to allow it to dry out.

'Listed building permission is sought to undertake exploratory drilling to establish the bearing capacity of the earth.

'The intention is to eventually construct a retaining wall to permanently eradicate the dampness problem.'

Durham Castle was built in the 11th century by William the Conqueror to assert the Normans' power in the north of England after their conquest of Britain in 1066.

In its later years the citadel became the palace of the Bishop of Durham, who was appointed by the monarch at the time, until the residence was moved to Auckland Castle.

The castle's large Great Hall was built in the 14th century and was the largest in Britain until Bishop Richard Foxe shortened it more than 100 years later.

In 1837, the castle, which had been converted into a college, was donated to the newly-formed University of Durham by Bishop Edward Maltby as accommodation for students.

Opened in 1840, it still houses more than 100 students, most of whom stay in the keep.

Since then the castle has served as an RAF post during the Second World War and is now part of a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Details of the plans submitted to Durham County Council reveal the university will drill five exploratory boreholes at the site in an attempt to alleviate the damp. 

Experts have described the works as 'essential' to prevent further deterioration of the site which served as a command and observation post for the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

A report, included in the planning application, said: 'The works to the Norman Chapel are essential to reduce the rate of decay of stonework within the chapel.' 

The chapel, which dates back to 1078, is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Grade I listed building is also home to 100 students.

The application seeks to safeguard the chapel, which is still used for occasional worship, adding: 'The proposal is to carry out a site investigation on the North Terrace of Durham Castle to provide geo-technical data for the design of a retaining wall adjacent to the Norman Chapel, which will expose the buried wall of the chapel and allow it dry out.'

Proposals submitted to planners said there will be no major visual impact and Durham University was unable to say if the work would affect use of the chapel, though the public can only access the castle on guided tours.

A decision is expected later in the year.
