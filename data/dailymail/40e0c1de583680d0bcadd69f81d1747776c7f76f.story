Spurs legend Gary Lineker has said that Tim Sherwood's policy of slagging off his players in public may well backfire on him.

The Tottenham boss had said on Wednesday that his squad were playing for their future after their humiliating 4-0 defeat to Chelsea on Saturday.

But on Twitter, Lineker said: 'Fascinating, honest but ultimately, I feel, unwise public condemnation of his own players by Tim Sherwood. Private, always the best way.

'There is no quicker way to lose the confidence and trust of your players than to slag them off publicly.'

Sherwood
 has held talks with Levy since the weekend defeat - and the Spurs 
manager has warned his stars that their futures are far from secure.

'A lot of the players here are playing for their futures. They know that now.

'They have to show they want to play for a giant of a club like Tottenham.

'Whether
 there's an overhaul in the squad is for me to decide. But there will be
 changes. I want players here to prove they want to be here.

'I hope my comments can have a galvanising effect.

'They know how I am, they know how I felt about what happened. We've got to move on, we canâ€™t dwell on it.

'Theyâ€™re all men, they know Iâ€™m saying it from the heart, not from a script, but on impulse. I shoot from the hip.'

Spurs midfielder Sandro backed Sherwood following his manager's public dressing down at the weekend.

The
 Brazil midfielder suggested that the players deserved to be criticised 
for their poor display and had no problem with the fact Sherwood vented 
his frustrations to millions of viewers on Sky Sports.

Tottenham
 face Benfica in the Europa League on Thursday evening and Sandro is 
using it as an opportunity to bounce back from the thumping at 
Stamford Bridge.

When asked whether Sherwood should 
have been so public in his staggering rant on Saturday evening, Sandro 
claimed his manager had every right.

'He
 said the same to us too,' the midfielder said. 'He is with us and we 
are with the manager. We have to show we care and we will show that.'

Sherwood
 had claimed that his players were 'too nice to one another' and blasted
 his squad for having a 'lack of character' in the wake of the thrashing
 in the London derby, but Sandro agrees.

'We
 are all friends, but we have to ask more of each other,' Sandro added. 
'We have to give more effort to our team. It has to be that way.

'Maybe
 we shouldn't be such good friends after all! We have to win every game.
 We are Tottenham and we will go for it. After Benfica we have Arsenal, 
if we beat them it changes everything. We won't give up.'

Sandro disagreed with the suggestion that the players are not hurt when Spurs lose.

'It hurts me a lot,' the 24-year-old said. 'I love football. After the game a lot was said, we felt it a lot.

'After a game like that there's no way you can't be hurt. We were sad but have to move forward. A win can change a lot.'

Tottenham's record signing Erik Lamela is out of the clash against Benfica with a back injury.
