Paranoid: Benjamin Pettitt attacked Dr Robert Davis so viciously in May 2012 that paramedics were initially unable to tell if he was still alive - because there was so much blood

A patient turned into 'little less than an animal' by a cocktail of drugs beat a doctor with a baseball bat before trying to gauge out his eyes after his worried grandmother called for medical help.

Benjamin Pettitt beat Dr Robert Davis so badly after he attended his home in Tewkesbury, Gloucester, that police called to the scene were unable to see if the doctor was still alive, because he was covered in so much blood.

The 33-year-old began attacking the doctor with a baseball bat, before the frenzied assault escalated and Pettitt began trying to 'bite chunks' out of his victim's face.

Pettittt then grabbed a knife to inflict numerous lacerations, as his horrified relatives called paramedics and police - who were forced to taser Pettitt.

Dr Davis survived, but the vicious attack has forced him to quit the medical profession because he was left unable to trust patients.

Gloucester Crown Court heard how, in the days leading up to the May 2012 attack, Pettitt had taken heroin and cocaine.

Pettitt became paranoid, convinced a number of French men wanted to kill him.

On the morning of the attack, he is understood to have taken an heavy cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants.

His grandmother had grown concerned with his paranoia as Pettitt was convinced that a number of French men wanted to kill him.

The morning of the attack he is also understood to have taken an heavy cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants.

His grandmother had become so concerned  she had called for a doctor - and it was Dr Davis who attended.

Prosecuting, Anna Vigars said: 'After about 15 minutes of rational conversation it suddenly turned.

'Pettitt shouted, "bastards like you are only in it for yourselves".

'He took a baseball bat and started to swing it at Dr Davis, he hit his arms, his shoulders and his nose. He hit him a number of times, including one very painful blow to his head.

'Then Mr Pettitt was on top of him, trying to gouge his eyes out. Mr Davis was trying to take hold of his arms.

'As his hands were moved away, (Pettitt) leaned forward and tried to bite Mr Davis' face - he tried to bite a chunk from his nose.

'He then began shouting, he shouted: 'I really want to kill you, it would be a huge adrenaline rush'. In terror Mr Davis was crying which he was mocked for by Mr Pettitt.

'Mr Pettitt then managed to get hold of knife. That caused the top part of his thumb to be sliced.

'Thereafter he described how he was punched a number of times, but when ambulance staff arrived it became clear they were actually stab wounds to his left shoulder and the left side of his head.

'At that stage they didn't know whether or not Mr Davis was alive simply because of the amount of blood.

'In a police interview he told officers it had felt like a dream and he had woken up remorseful for what had happened.'

The doctor, who had been practising for 27 years, was left with a number of lacerations to his head, thumb and shoulder, as well as a fractured nose and bruising. 

The damage to his thumb was so bad, he required plastic surgery.

But it was the mental scars Dr Davis was left with which have refused to heal.  

Mental scars: Dr Davis has since quit medicine, saying his is unable to trust patients anymore

In a victim impact statement read in court, Dr Davis revealed: 'By July this year (2013) I have very little left in the was of physical injuries - I do consider myself very lucky.

'But mentally the affect this has had on me has been far harder to come to terms with.

'In the first four weeks I was bursting into tears very often and my emotions were up and down.

'I found myself waking in the middle of the night thinking about what had happened - I struggled to sleep.

'It seemed incomprehensible that this could happened to me.

'I feel no malice towards him. I feel more anger to the NHS for putting me in the situation where my safety was at risk.

'Due to this attack I feel no desire towards returning to work. I'm not sure I could sit there and try to help patients again in case I am in a similar situation.

'Overall this has had a huge impact on my life. This is probably a career ending event for me.

'The memory of this ordeal will stay with me for a very long time.'

Psychiatric expert Dr Tim Amos told the court that Pettitt suffered from a number of drug induced mental health problems.

Brendan Moorhouse, defending, said his client had 'expressed genuine remorse' for the attack.

He added: 'He understands the consequences to the doctor and he lives with the results of his actions every day.'

Judge Jamie Tabor QC ordered that he was hospitalised under Section 45 of the mental health act.

He also imposed a minimum prison sentence of nine years, meaning if Pettitt is released from hospital within that time frame he must serve the remainder of the nine years in prison.

On sentence the judge told him: 'This cocktail of drugs turned you into quite frankly little less than an animal - causing you to shout out you wanted to kill that man and that you would get an adrenaline rush from it.

'You wouldn't recognise that man if you saw him.'
