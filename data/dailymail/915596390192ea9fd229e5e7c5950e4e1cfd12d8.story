He is regarded as one of Britain’s best-loved camp comedians. So it may come as a surprise to find Julian Clary once dated a woman -  and almost became a father.

The 54-year-old star made the revelation during an intimate interview, in which he chose not to reveal the name of the woman, but described her as  ‘unique’.

He only discovered she was expecting after they parted and she subsequently lost the baby. The prospect of having come close to being a father is a matter he clearly thinks about.

Piers Morgan's Life Stories: Julian Clary delves deep into his past in the TV show which will be aired this Friday

Appearing on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories, he said: ‘I was very sad that she’d had to go through a miscarriage and thrilled that I was fertile, in a strange sort of way.

‘I couldn’t help imagining what the child would have been like. Now it would have been 35.

‘It’d be marvellous, wouldn’t it? It could drive me round and do the shopping.’

Mr Clary said he stayed in touch with the woman and Mr Morgan asks him: ‘You’ve suggested that when you see her, ‘Your heart still races and you imagine a life other than the one you have lived.’

To which Mr Clary replies: ‘She is unique in that she is the one woman that I had that sort of relationship with, so, yes, one does ponder these things.’

Warming to the theme of fatherhood, Mr Clary, who rose to fame as The Joan Collins Fan Club, and has appeared as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing, said he thought about having a baby with a lesbian friend many years ago but would not be sure about it now.

He said: ‘I certainly was [broody] in my forties, yes. I think it’s inevitable, you get to that age and if you haven’t, you just kind of wonder what it would be like.

‘Yes, we [his lesbian friend and him] talked about it, I was going to need a mother to do it for me at some point, wasn’t I?

‘So, yes, I discussed it with a lesbian friend. We got as far as her working out her cycle, and all this, when I would have to turn up with the turkey baster. Exactly what would be the optimum moment.’

Mr Clary suffered a fall from grace when in 1993 at the televised British Comedy Awards he made a lewd joke about the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, who was in the audience.

As the show was televised live, it was beamed into shocked homes across the nation. London Weekend Television was required to make a primetime apology.

The incident coincided with Mr Clary contemplating taking his own life.  Describing the moment he checked into a hotel on Park Lane and considered taking an overdose, Mr Clary said: ‘It was nothing to do with saying something rude and then being infamous for that, that wasn’t why I was depressed.

‘There were lots of other factors. When I said what I said about Norman Lamont, it was a joke that came to me that evening and I thought I’d get a laugh.

‘I was having anxiety problems and it was manifesting as sort of day long panic attacks.

‘It’s very hard to describe but I was so worked up that I was prescribed valium for during the day and rohypnal to take at night.

‘I remember I’d been driving around and I did check into that hotel and I did get all my pills out and I thought, ‘I’ll just lie down for 20 minutes before I take this major step’, and then I fell asleep or I thought better of it.’

Mr Clary has been in a relationship with 36-year-old Ian Mackley, an advertising executive for nine years. The pair met on a yacht in Ibiza.

The star, who was last seen on ITV’s Your Face Sounds Familiar, said he was ‘very keen on gay marriage’ but would wait until he was asked.

The interview will be shown on Friday evening at 9pm on ITV.
