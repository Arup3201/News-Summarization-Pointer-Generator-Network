Many men with erectile dysfunction currently face a difficult decision - they can either accept a less satisfying sex life or they can take Viagra and put up with the side effects.

And these are the lucky ones - millions of men with sexual function problems do not even have the option of taking Viagra as it is not suitable for people with angina or those who have had a stroke or a heart attack.

But, there could soon be another option for the millions of men with erectile problems.

A new cream which is currently being trialled in the U.S. could eventually replace Viagra tablets

A U.S. biotechnology company is trialling a cream which could improve sexual function without causing side effects.

Strategic Science and Technologies has completed the first phase of clinical trials of the cream, SST-6006, which has the same active ingredient as Viagra.

The cream is applied directly to the man's genitals where the drug passes through the skin and into the tissue, in a bid to improve sexual function.

The trial revealed that the cream causes far fewer side effects than Viagra tablets and the researchers say that any recorded side effects were mild.

In contrast, Viagra is known to cause side effects including nausea, headaches, facial flushing and an upset stomach.

Viagra can also not be taken by men with bleeding problems, angina, kidney problems, liver problems or those who have had a heart attack or a stroke.

The cream has the same active ingredient as Viagra but does not cause the same side effects

The researchers gave some of the volunteers the cream while a control group were given Viagra.

Tests
 revealed that the levels of the active ingredient - sildenafil - in the
 blood were more than 20 times lower in the patients who had used the 
cream than in those who had taken Viagra.

'With a growing concern about systemic 
side effects associated with the current oral forms of PDE-5 inhibitors,
 a topical treatment approach such as SST-6006 could enable patients 
with [erectile dysfunction] to benefit from a local therapeutic dose of 
sildenafil directly into the penile tissue while reducing the risk of 
unwanted systemic side effects,' said Dr Irwin Goldstein, Director of 
Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital and Director of San Diego Sexual 
Medicine.

'[This is a] novel delivery technology to positively impact sexual health in both men and women.'

The researchers do accept, however, that their tests are yet to confirm whether the cream actually improves sexual function.

All their clinical trial as so far proved is that it is safe for use and that it does pass into penile tissue when applied directly to the skin.

Erectile dysfunction is estimated to affect 13 to 20 per cent of men between the ages of 40 and 80.
