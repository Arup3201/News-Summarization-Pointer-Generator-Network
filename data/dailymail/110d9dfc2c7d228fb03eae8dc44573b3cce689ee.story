A businesswoman plummeted 80ft to her death from an exclusive open air restaurant on the roof of an office building in London last night.

The smartly dressed Asian woman fell eight storeys from the top of Sir Terence Conran's restaurant Coq D'Argent at 6.30pm, landing in front of hundreds of commuters outside Bank station.

Eyewitness said she took a sip of wine from her glass on the outdoor terrace in the City, before putting her handbag on the floor and then toppling over the edge of the restaurant.

Passers-by and paramedics tried to revive her, but she was pronounced dead. The victim was described as smartly-dressed although she was wearing a jumper, trousers and trainers.

Police arrived and diners then had to leave the Coq d’Argent French restaurant.

A diner at the restaurant, which appeared in the James Bond-themed sequence for the Olympics opening ceremony that featured the Queen, told the Evening Standard that people had been chatting and eating when the woman toppled over the side.

He said: 'All of a sudden the restaurant went quiet and a staff member said we had to leave. It was extremely eerie.'

The restaurant was seen in the film as Her Majesty, alongside
James Bond actor Daniel Craig, apparently flew over on her way to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, where she 'parachuted' in for the opening ceremony. Diners were seen waving to the helicopter.

It is the third death to have occurred at the restaurant, which stands at the top of a building used by the firm Aviva Investments.

Sir Terence Conran owns the popular restaurant which is in the heart of the City and where the woman suddenly plunged to her death

In May 2007, City employee Richard Ford, 33, died after he plunged from the terrace and landed on a bus.

In July 2009, stockbroker Anjool Malde, 24, leaped to his death from the venue holding a glass of champagne after being suspended from his job at Deutsche Bank.

One onlooker who works in the City posted a message on Twitter saying: 'My heart has never beat so deep and fast in all my life. People were crying their eyes out. She landed 20 metres in front of me.

'I just can’t believe how close I was 
to the whole thing, I don’t think this City life is for me. I mean how 
bad can things have been 4 her?

'Absolutely
numb, just in shock. Can’t get the image out of my mind. I don’t want 
to end up like her. That city square mile sucks the life out of you.'

A City of London Police spokesman 
said: 'At approximately 18.30 a woman was seen to fall from a building 
in Poultry. She was pronounced dead at the scene.'

David
Loewie, managing director of D&D London, which owns Coq d’Argent, 
said: 'It is a very sad case, but we cannot comment further as a police 
investigation is under way.'

Coq
d’Argent serves classic French food at its rooftop restaurant which 
lies in formal gardens with panoramic views across the City.

The Le Coq d'Argent Terrace was busy with customers when the tragic incident happened last night
