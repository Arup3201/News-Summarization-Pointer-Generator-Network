Tragedy: William Avery-Wright died as he crossed a road outside his school on the way to play rugby

A 13-year-old private school pupil shouted 'Oh my God' before a Land Rover knocked him down as he crossed a main road to play rugby, an inquest has heard.

William Avery-Wright and a school friend were left to cross the 60mph-limit main road on their own because they were running late for a match, a coroner was told.

The sporty teenager, who played golf 
at county level, was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at East 
Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, on November 30, 2011.

His friend told police that William froze and said 'Oh my God' before the Defender hit him outside the £30,000-a-year school.

The boy’s parents are suing Worth School in Crawley, West Sussex, claiming teachers should have supervised him crossing the road.

They are also angry that the school announced the tragic news on its website before his devastated father had even been informed of the death crash.

Insurance broker Chistopher Avery-Wright  found out about the tragedy when he started to receive texts and emails of condolence from people who had seen the message while he was being driven to hospital by police.

The Roman Catholic school has said it acted in 'good faith' and incorrectly thought both parents had been informed when it published the tribute.

The inquest in Crawley first heard from Graham Voller, the driver of the Land Rover Defender which struck William.

He said he was driving at around 40mph in the 60mph zone with his grand-daughter in the passenger seat at the time of the crash.

He said: 'I got to a short distance of
the crossing and through the side window I just saw someone on the side
of the road. I only saw one (person).

'And then the young lad just arrived 
in front of the Land Rover. Just as the boy hit the Land Rover I did an 
emergency stop. I had little time to react.

'When I stopped, I got out of the Land Rover and looked to see the boy, and got straight on to the mobile phone.'

Mr Voller will not face criminal charges over the crash, which happened on a road he said he travelled on up to 15 times a day.

Coroner Bridget Dolan heard that the boy who was with William when he 
was struck described in a statement to police how he 'froze' and that 
the crash had left him feeling a sense of 'disbelief'.

He told how they were going to play a 
school rugby match which required them crossing a road, and that they 
were running late.

The boy mentioned to William that his 
sock was down. He told police: 'I was looking at my shoe and then after 
two seconds, I looked up at Will. He was on the pavement.

'I saw him running and stop, and (he) said, ‘Oh my God’, and then the whole thing happened.'

He added: 'I didn’t see the car before it all happened.'

The boy later added that he thought 
William was 'in the middle' of running and walking at the time of the 
crash.

The boy said he had crossed the road before without adult 
supervision and that he had not been made to wait for a teacher to help 
him across.

Alan Mitchell, a teacher at Worth 
School who had overall responsibility for the games department, faced 
questions about the school’s policy on safe road crossing for pupils.

Under the school’s rules, he said 
students in Years 7 and 8 had to have adult supervision when crossing 
the road. William was in Year 8.

Questioned by the Avery-Wrights’ 
solicitor, Mr Mitchell said the policies did not state what should 
happen if a student is late. He added: 'I would’ve expected them to go 
to games staff or a member of the house.'

Mr Mitchell said the policy was 
communicated to pupils via the bursar who would give them a health and 
safety talk at the start of the year. And he said staff would be 
expected to read policies.

William was a day pupil at the school, where he excelled in rugby, cricket, football and golf.

The hearing continues.
