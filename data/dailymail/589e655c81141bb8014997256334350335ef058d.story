Jamie Carragher and Co have reacted to the news of the staggering £5.136billion Premier League TV rights deal.

The Sportsmail columnist says 'that's his coaching badges out of the window for a few years' now, with fellow colleague Gary Neville delighted with the outcome for Sky - who secured five out of the seven package deals - but says sensible ticket pricing must now be enforced and grass roots football must also benefit greatly from this.

Below is the rest of the reaction to the staggering deal via social media and other platforms.

The Premier League has announced a record £5bn TV right deal to be shared between Sky and BT Sport

The Premier League will continue to be shown on Sky Sports and BT Sport until 2019 in a £5.136bn deal

Jamie Carragher: That's the coaching badges out the window for a few years. Great day for @SkyFootball but with the amounts involved ticket pricing especially for away fans has too change. £20 for the 20 away games.

Gary Neville: I want sensible ticket pricing and grass roots football to benefit as much as possible from this deal. Who doesn't! This is a big issue! However the @SkyFootball staff produce / direct and present football better than anyone else. The best won! 

Michael Owen: Great news that BT Sport will be showing even more games in the future. Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, Europa League, German League, Italian League etc.

Peter Coates: It is vitally important [to lower ticket costs]. The stadia need to be full especially with away support and we need to maintain that. The lower and average incomes need to be facilitated.

'We will certainly want our supporters to benefit from the money we get from TV rights. We have already done that and I am sure other clubs will do the same. 

'It is a market situation. Football has a huge global attraction and we can attract that sort of money because we can offer the product. It is a bit over the top to call it obscene. 

Gary Lineker: £5billion for the new @PremierLeague TV deal. The game's awash with money. Cut ticket prices & make it affordable for real fans to attend.

Jake Humphrey: Delighted that @premierleague football remains on @btsport for another 3 years. More games, plus Champs League, FA Cup & European matches. 42 matches per season, many games at 5.30pm on a Saturday evening and midweek evening games too.

Ed Chamberlin: Delighted with the news from the Premier League! #SuperSunday #MNF

Rob Draper: £5.136bn TV deal means PL has reached point where fans are much more important for atmosphere they provide than the money they pay. 

Adam Crafton: Ligue 1 TV deal worth £538m between 2016 and 2020. Premier League rises to £5b. Huge blow for PSG in light of FFP in transfer market.

Tom Mockridge (Virgin Media): This is hurting fans and does not warrant an exemption from normal competition law rules.

Jeremy Darroch, Sky's Group Chief Executive: 'This is a good result and confirms that Sky is the unrivalled choice for sports fans. We went into the Premier League auction with a clear objective and are pleased to have secured the rights that we wanted.'

Barney Francis, Managing Director of Sky Sports: 'We are looking forward to bringing even more live Premier League football to viewers. Only Sky Sports will have the best match picks and the best slots so our viewers will be able to follow the biggest matches, the key head to heads and every club at least four times. No other broadcaster comes close.

'The best Premier League coverage is part of an unrivalled range of sport across our seven channels and digital platforms. 

'This new deal follows our recent success in the rights market, ensuring Sky Sports will be the first choice for years to come.'

John Petter, BT Consumer CEO: 'I am pleased we will be showing Premier League football for a further three years and that we have secured the prime Saturday evening slot. These new rights will enhance our existing schedule of football, rugby and other international sport, including all the live footballing action from the UEFA Champions and Europa Leagues starting this summer.

'BT Sport has got off to a strong start, reaching more than five million households and commercial premises, by making itself far more affordable and accessible to sports fans.'
