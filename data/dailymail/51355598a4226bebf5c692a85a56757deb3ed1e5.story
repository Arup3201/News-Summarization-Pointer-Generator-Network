The frozen body of 19-year-old man was found in his pick-up truck outside his Ohio family home on Thursday as the Midwest suffers through weeks of freezing temperatures.

Andrew Norris's stepmother found his frigid body slumped in the front seat of the snow-covered vehicle, where he frequently retreated to talk to friends on his cell phone.

Bitterly cold temperatures have shut 
down Ohio schools, facilities and government offices this month, with 
wind chills dropping to 40 degrees below zero including wind chill on some days.

On the day Mr Norris's body was found temperatures were as low as zero degrees - and police are investigating whether he froze to death in the driveway of the Erich Drive, Willoughby Hills home.

Police said Norris's family had last seen him on Tuesday and believed he was staying with a friend. 

19 Action News reported  there were no signs of violence, alcohol or drug activity in the vehicle and that it was difficult to see Norris in the car from the outside.

The Cuyahoga County medical examiner's office is working to determine whether the teen died of hypothermia. It could take up to three months.

Detective Brian Jackson of Willoughby Police told the News-Herald: 'Whether he died because of the cold or not, we donâ€™t know.'

Norris's family said he often sat in the truck to talk with friends on his cell phone. 

The 19-year-old worked at a local Texas Roadhouse diner after graduating from Willoughby South High School.

Ohio has not escaped the deep freeze which has seized the U.S. this month, with temperatures dropping to a low zero degrees on Thursday when Norris was found.

In early January, the bodies of two people were found in snow in Ohio following the brutal polar vortex.

A
 postal worker discovered the body of a 42-year-old man in his driveway,
 while a 58-year-old man was found dead on a lake after failing to 
return home.

The cold snap has forced the cancellation of thousands of flights, shut down offices and whipped up potentially life-threatening wind chills across the country.
