A young British footballer has died after collapsing in his college apartment in the United States from a suspected heart attack.

Peter McAvoy, 22, a student at Herkimer College in New York State who was America's reigning Junior College Player of the Year, died on Saturday evening.

He was pronounced dead in hospital despite attempts by Campus safety officers and medics to revive him.

His father said the former Craigiebarns 
Primary and Craigie High school pupil just 'keeled over' without 
warning while sitting on his settee.

Peter McAvoy Snr paid 
tribute to his son at the family home in Craigie as he tried to make 
sense of his son's sudden death.

The
 head of education at Perth and Kinross Council said: 'Peter went with 
some friends to watch the softball team play and went back to his 
apartment afterwards when he died.

'He was sitting on the settee and just keeled over at about tea-time.

'His flatmate called for the campus security and they fried to resuscitate him.

'He was taken to hospital where they spent another hour trying to bring him back to life, but weren't able to.

'The medics believe he had a massive heart attack. It's just hard to believe, he was a fit young man.'

Mr McAvoy, from Dundee, 
who was captain of the college soccer team, was taken to nearby Little 
Falls Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

His father, who rushed back from holiday in Gran Canaria after he heard
 the news on Saturday, recalled the last time he spoke to his son.

He
 said: 'I spoke him recently and he was telling me they were having a 
ceremony next week because the team had won the league and the cup this 
season.

'He told me he would be speaking at the ceremony and he was really looking forward to it. I just can't believe it.

'We have no heart attack history in the family, neither my side or his mother's.

'He had so much potential. He went to America two years ago and won the championships in both seasons.

'I've been overwhelmed by the expressions of sympathy from both America and Dundee.'

The former Arbroath SC and Tayport FC 
defender went to the United States in 2012 where he played for New York 
State's Herkimer Generals and was America's reigning Junior College 
Player of the Year.

Dean of students Matthew Hawes said: 'Our deepest condolences are with Peter's family as they grieve this tragic loss.

'Our thoughts are also with his team-mates, coaches, friends, faculty and staff during this difficult time.'

Craig 
Brown, co-manager of East Craigis FC, who played with Peter at Arbroath 
SC, added: 'He was just a gentleman, a really nice guy. Nobody can get 
their head around it.

'It's
 a tragedy He was an absolute legend of a guy - he would do anything for
 you - and on the football pitch he was a superb player.'

The cause of his death is not known and a post-mortem examination will be carried out, the college said.

Mr McAvoy was named national player of the year last year by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America.

The college is holding a candlelit vigil in his memory at its Wehrum Stadium this evening.

The cause of Peter McAvoy's death has not yet been established, but his father says medics believe it was a heart attack.

If that proves to be the case, it would be another incident of heart conditions hitting seemingly healthy young footballers in recent years.

Fabrice Muamba, 25, was forced to retire from the game after collapsing on the pitch from a cardiac arrest in March 2012 at Tottenham's White Hart Lane ground.

The former England Under-21 midfielder was effectively dead for 78 minutes when his heart stopped beating during an FA Cup match for Bolton at Tottenham.

Just a month later an Italian footballer collapsed on the pitch and died from a heart attack in front of horrified teammates and supporters.

Former under-21 international Piermario Morosini, 25, who played for Livorno, was seen to tremble before falling to his knees and never regained consciousness.

In July last year, former Birmingham City striker Christian Benitez died from respiratory failure after a cardiac arrest at the age of 27.

The Ecuador international's death came just a few weeks after his £10million switch to Qatari side El Jaish from Mexican team Club America.

There are a number of congenital heart defects that can hit sportsmen. 

The one which most commonly kills young athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

A genetic defect, it causes part of the heart muscle to thicken in about one in 500 people. It is most serious in the young and is exacerbated by exercise.

In some countries, such as Italy, screening for this condition is mandatory for footballers and sufferers are not allowed to play. 

But in Britain it is up to individual clubs.

Other, less common possible causes of sudden cardiac arrest include ARVD, another disorder of the heart muscle which causes part of it to turn to fat; faults with the heart’s electrical impulses; irregular rhythms; or defective heart valves.
