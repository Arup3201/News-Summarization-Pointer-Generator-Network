According to Zuri, 31 passengers had been rescued.

The agency sent one boat to the area to search for survivors and was sending two more.

Malaysia's New Straits Times said the boat sank around midnight on Tuesday about two miles (3km) from the coastal town of Banting on the Strait of Malacca.

Tens of thousands of Indonesians work illegally in plantations and other industries in Malaysia, sometimes risking dangerous boat journeys to return home.
