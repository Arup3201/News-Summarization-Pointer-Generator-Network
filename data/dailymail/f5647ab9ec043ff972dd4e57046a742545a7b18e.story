A major immunisation programme aims to protect teenagers against a potentially lethal new strain of meningitis after a steep rise in cases.

There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England. 

This is a rise of 431 per cent.

Some experts said the levels could even indicate a public health emergency.

While the rise was initially seen in adults, it has now extended to all age groups and, for the first time in a decade, young children have died as a result of MenW. 

There has also been a rise in cases among students. It is proposed to immunise teenagers aged 14 to 18 in an attempt to halt the disease’s spread.

Andrew Pollard, chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the upsurge in cases was caused by a ‘highly aggressive strain of the bug’.

He said: ‘We reviewed the outbreak in detail and concluded that this increase was likely to continue in future years unless action is taken.

‘We have therefore advised the Department of Health to implement a vaccination programme for teenagers as soon as possible which we believe will have a substantial impact on the disease and protect the public’s health.’

Campaigners said the Government’s delay in introducing a vaccine against meningitis B – the last major strain of the disease – may have hindered the fight.

Statistics show one baby dies every month in Britain from meningitis B and charities claim dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials.

Chris Head, of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘We applaud the quick action by the Government to protect 14 to 18-year-olds using the MenACWY vaccine.

‘However, it will take more than a year for this protection to filter through to toddlers and infants, and in the meantime under-fives will still be dying and disabled as a result of MenW.’
