Two U.S. Navy sailors were convicted and sentenced to prison on Friday for raping and robbing a woman on Okinawa in a crime that outraged many on the southern Japanese island.

Seaman Christopher Browning, of Athens, Texas, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Skyler Dozierwalker, of Muskogee, Oklahoma, were found guilty by the Naha District Court of raping and robbing a woman in her 20s in a parking lot in October. Both admitted committing the crime.

Browning, 24, was sentenced to 10 years and Dozierwalker, 23, received nine years.

Anger: The case outraged many Okinawans, who have long complained of military-related crime on their island, such as the rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen in 2005

The case outraged many Okinawans, who have long complained of military-related crime on their island, such as the rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen in 2005.

According to details released during the trial, Dozierwalker and Browning grabbed the Japanese woman at her apartment door after she ignored them when they attempted to talk to her during the early hours of October 16.

The men followed her home and covered her mouth while dragging her to a nearby parking lot. The pair then repeatedly choked and raped her, stole 7,000 yen (around $87) from her purse and left.

In court, Dozierwalker testified that he 'felt like a monster' when he heard the details of the crime.

Prosecutors had sought up to 12 years in prison for Browning and 10 years for Dozierwalker, arguing that they had 'indulged their lust,' and 'committed acts of humiliation and cruelty against the victim.'

Both men admitted their guilt, but the defense had argued that such a long sentence would be excessive.

In handing down the verdict, 
presiding judge Hideyuki Suzuki said the sentences were in line with the
severity of the crimes, which he called 'contemptible and violent.'

The sailors were temporarily deployed
to Japan with their unit and were reportedly drinking before the rape took
place. They will serve their sentences in a Japanese prison.

During the case both sailors expressed their remorse and willingness to accept responsibility.

According to Japan Daily Press, Dozierwalker even stated that he knew what sexual abuse was like as he had been molested when he was eight.

Dozierwalker told the court he was responsible for the crime and claimed he was sorry for 'leading Browning down the wrong path.'

Browning reportedly cried into his own hands and gave personal apologies to the victim, the Japanese public and the U.S. military.

Okinawa hosts around two-thirds of the 50,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan. Tensions between U.S. forces and Okinawa residents reached boiling point in 2005 after three American service members raped a 12-year-old Japanese girl.

Responsible? Dozierwalker told the court he was responsible for the crime and claimed he was sorry for 'leading Browning down the wrong path.'

Opposition: The rape in October came amid large protests over the U.S. military's decision to base the controversial Osprey aircraft aircraft at an Okinawan Marine facility

The U.S. military initially took the men into custody, but after protests, they were handed over to Japanese law enforcement to be tried.

One man was sentenced to six and a half years while the other men were given seven years in a Japanese prison.

The 2012 rape case sparked tougher restrictions for all U.S. service members in Japan, including a 11 pm - 5 am curfew and drinking restrictions.

Yet since Browning and Dozierwalker were arrested there has been at least one crime committed every month by U.S. servicemen involving alcohol, as reported by the Japan Daily Press.

In November a drunk serviceman reportedly broke into an apartment and punched 13-year-old boy who lived there.

Tensions between U.S. troops and Okinawans are endemic because of islanders' complaints of noise, the danger of accidents and crimes committed by servicemen.

The rape in October came amid large protests over the U.S. military's decision to base a new kind of aircraft at an Okinawan Marine facility.

The controversial MV-22 Osprey, a hybrid between a helicopter and plane, has suffered a series of fatal accidents. Japan has asked the U.S. not to base the Osprey at Okinawa due to concerns over its safety record.

Although most crimes committed by U.S. military personnel in Japan are handled by military courts, they can be prosecuted in Japanese courts in cases that occur off base and are deemed to be particularly serious, such as murder and rape.
