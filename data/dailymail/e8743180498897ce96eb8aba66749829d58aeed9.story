Parents who took their 11-year-old son out of school without permission to attend his great-grandfather's memorial service in America have had a legal case against them dropped.

Essex County Council had demanded that James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, pay a £120 fine for taking their son, Toby, to the service, but the parents refused.

The Haymores had denied failing to ensure a child attended school regularly and were due to stand trial at Colchester Magistrates Court in November, but the council have now dropped the case.

James and Dana Haymore were taken to court after refusing to pay a £120 fine for taking their son to his great-grandfather's memorial service in America

Since last September, new laws on school absences mean anyone who takes their children out of school without permission can be fined up to £2,500.

The prosecution was brought after the couple took Toby out of Chancellor Park Primary School, Chelmsford, between December 16 and 20 last year and on January 7 this year for a memorial service for Mrs Haymore's grandfather in the US.

The couple were expected to argue that the decision breached the European Convention of Human Rights Article 8, because it affected their right to a family life.  

Mrs Haymore welcomed the news, saying: 'We feel it is the right decision. No parent should have criminal charges brought against them for doing what is in the best interest of their children.

'Parents' roles are to know and love their families individually, better than any government does collectively, and make the best choices for them.

'We hope this is a step towards helping establish family rights. 

Essex County Council revealed that the prosecution had been discontinued after the family moved to the U.S..

Ray Gooding, cabinet member for education at the council, said: 'We have had to take a decision based on the public interest of pursuing a case where the family have emigrated and are no longer being educated in an Essex school.

'This is an unusual situation but we have chosen to be pragmatic and accept that continuing with the prosecution serves little purpose and will cost the council money.

'We take unauthorised absence very seriously and support the principle of the Government's strengthening of the rules in September 2013, which meant that term-time absence had to be authorised by head teachers and only in exceptional circumstances.

'It is extremely important to remember that in this case, the school followed the policy to the letter.'

Liberty, who had represented the parents, said the Haymores had been prepared to travel to the UK to clear their name.

Legal director James Welch said: 'With a little helping hand from the Human Rights Act, common sense has prevailed.

'Criminalising parents for taking children out of school for important family events was hardly the best use of council resources, court time or public money.

'Heavy-handed rules like this go no way towards tackling the deeper, more complex problems that lie behind regular absence from school.'

A spokesman for the school said there would be no change to its policy on non-attendance.

A statement added: 'Chancellor Park Primary takes school attendance very seriously and following Government guidance only authorises term time holidays in exceptional circumstances.

'We adhered to the law in this case, passing to the local authority to progress the fines.

'The matter of dropping the legal case against Mr and Mrs Haymore is not one for the school and will not result in any change to our attendance policies.' 

Parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated.

Headteachers, social workers or police can issue parents penalty notices of up to £120 if a child regularly misses school, and their parents have not taken action or asked for help.

If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence.

Council officials say that, aside from their education suffering, children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships, and are more likely to get involved with crime.

Various options are available to headteachers, social workers or police including issuing parents with penalty notices between £60 and £120 if parents have not taken action or asked for help.

If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence.

The Government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect.

Under the changes, truancy fines have risen from £50 to £60, and from £100 to £120 if they are not paid within 28 days. Guidance on school holidays has also changed, with headteachers now only granting permission for term time trips in 'exceptional circumstances'. 

Almost 64,000 fines have been handed down to parents since the law changed this time last year. 

Sally Randall, 35, landed herself with a criminal record after taking her son to Majorca during term-time to say goodbye to his dying grandfather.

She pleaded guilty to a truancy charge when she appeared at Blackburn Magistrates' Court, Lancashire.

In February Nicola Duke was one of three parents prosecuted for failing to ensure their child attends Furness Academy in Barrow, Cumbria, and was fined £500 along with £120 of other costs.

And in May, a 10-year-old girl was refused time off from Hansbury Farm Primary School, Tamworth to attend her grandfather's funeral - because the reasons for her absence did not amount to 'exceptional circumstances'.
