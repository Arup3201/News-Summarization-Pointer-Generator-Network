Modernising: Once reliant on Victorian buildings, prison governors now have phones in every cell

Prisoners in newly-built jails will have phones and computer terminals in their cells so they are able to contact relatives, arrange activities and order meals.

The feature will be rolled out in the newest prisons in the UK in order to improve the quality of prisoner accommodation.

According to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) published today, in-cell phones and computer terminals have already been installed in HMP Thameside.

The report recommended new prisons contain ‘terminals to book activities and order meals’.

It added: ‘In-cell telephones, as well as allowing prisoners to maintain family contact (important for successful rehabilitation), also contribute to prisoner safety,’ the report said.

The phones will be used in new prisons throughout England and Wales, where more than 2,500 prisoners are housed.

The Government’s spending watchdog said the facilities built by National Offender Management Service provide ‘a good standard of accommodation for prisoners.’

The report said that the new forms of communication had been welcomed by prisoners in focus groups.

‘Prisoners generally recognised the improvement in accommodation, as has the independent inspectorate,' it added.

More than 90 per cent of cells have built-in showers and in all new buildings have attached toilets.

The report, which looked at value for money across the prison system, said the measures were introduced because they saved funds.

Ease: There is no more queueing for precious moments on the phone in several prisons, where talking to relatives from their cells helps prisoners integrate into the wider world, the report said (file photo)

Cell: Having more facilities inside cells saved time and money unlocking them, said the NAO (file photo)

Removing the need to unlock prisoners to wash helps to reduce staff costs, while in-cell telephones reduce the need to set up queues for communal phones or watch prisoners out of their cells.

Elsewhere the report said more foreign prisoners should be removed from the country after the number of deportations fell by 14 per cent since 2009.

It added: 'Removing more prisoners would allow the Agency to reduce prison capacity. This could happen if the Home Office prioritised cases better, improved case administration and used the foreign national offender-only prisons, that the Agency has created, more effectively.'

Meanwhile only 14 per cent of prisoners in new capacity now share cells - but some are in overcrowded conditions, the report said, adding it was 'against United Nations and Council of Europe guidelines'.

The report claimed changes to the prison system have saved £71 million since 2010.
