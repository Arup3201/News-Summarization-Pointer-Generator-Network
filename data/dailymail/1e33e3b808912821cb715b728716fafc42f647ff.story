The fiancee of a man whose first wife died of ovarian cancer has spoken of how a letter the dying woman left her 'touched her heart in so many ways'.

Mother-of-four Brenda Schmitz had written two letters one month before she died in August 2011 - one to her husband David Schmitz and the other to whoever his new partner would be - and asked a friend to send it to KSTZ radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, when her husband found someone new.

Jayne Abraham, herself a mother-of-two, said the letter had given her strength against 'any doubt I might have had' about her new relationship.

Beyond the grave: Brenda Schmitz, who wrote a letter to be read out on KSTZ radio

New beginnings: David Schmitz and his new fiancee Jayne Abraham, who both received beyond-the-grave letters from Mr Schmitz's former wife Brenda

She said: 'There were times when maybe it was 
questionable and I struggled personally a little bit because I wasn't 
sure that it was really the right time.

'David always assured me, "I'm 
ready for this". He told me that she had left a 
letter for me also and at that point I was all tears.

'He said, well, 
you can read it when we get home tonight. I read the letter and it 
touched my heart in so many different ways.It filled 
the package for me with any doubt that I might have had.'

Ms
 Abraham said the letter had been lighthearted and that Mrs Schmitz had 
made jokes in it, ending with 'how much she loves us through my letter 
and she loves me... [and saying] you need to give them all the love that
 all children need'.

For more than 20 years, KSTZ radio
 station in Des Moines has been granting Christmas wishes for 
listeners - including Mrs Schmitz's request.

Right time: Brenda Schmitz, centre, wanted to give her blessings to her husband's future fiancee

In the letter, Brenda asks the 
station to fulfill her last wish to do something for the new woman in 
her husband's life, for her family and for the doctors and nurses who 
helped ease her pain.

It has become an online hit - something that Ms Abraham described as 'extremely amazing and untouchable'.

She said: 'We didn't expect the publicity, we didn't
 expect it to go where it has gone, and I think we're both extremely 
touched by the love and the support and the comments and the prayers and
 everything that everyone has sent forth to us.

'Our hearts are just throbbing and so filled right now.'

Mr Schmitz proposed to Ms Abraham in the summer. She said: 'When I first met David, I knew he said he
 had a little guy, Max, and he was two when we met, and he had older 
boys.

'At first I really didn't think anything of it. I have two children
 of my own and I love kids.

'Every day we've gotten stronger and we've 
developed a stronger bond and relationship.'

Mr Schmitz said he first heard the letter when the station read it to him the day before it went out on air at 7.10am on Friday, read by the programme host Colleen Kelly.

He said: 'They said they had received a letter that someone wanted to grant me a wish. I asked who is it from and 
they said it's so personal that we can't tell you over the phone. You 
need to come in here.

'They started by saying it was dated August 3 2011. They said you 
recently lost your wife Brenda to ovarian cancer. They read it and I was in shock - it was unfathomable. 

'The whole process of what I heard, the wishes - it was very tough. My 
mind was going every which way and couldn't' fathom that the letter 
exists and the letter that she wrote to Jane also. It was quite 
incredible.'

Pampering: Brenda's first wish was that Jayne (right) be treated to a spa day, saying she deserves it with taking on the responsibility of all Brenda's sons - including youngest Max (left)

Christmas wish: Brenda's second wish was that her family get a vacation where they can make memories to last a lifetime. She also asked that the nurses and doctors who treated her get a dinner for helping her through her pain

Mrs Schmitz had written: 'When you are in 
receipt of this letter, I will have already lost my battle to ovarian 
cancer.

'I told [my friend] once my loving husband David 
had moved on in his life and had met someone to share his life with 
again, to mail this letter to all of you at the station.

Her first wish was directed at her husband's fiance, asking that she be treated to a spa day.

'She
 deserves it,' Mrs Schmitz wrote. 'Being a step-mother to all those boys, and
 especially giving little Max a mother's love that only she can give. 
Make her smile and know her efforts are truly appreciated from me.'

'Thank you. I love you, whoever you are,' she added.

The second wish was that her family be taken on a magical trip, somewhere they could all enjoy and make memories to last a lifetime.

Her final wish was for the nurses and doctors who took care of her in the cancer unit at Mercy Medical Center.

'A night out full of drinks, food and fun for all they do every day for the cancer patients they encounter,' she wrote.

Her husband fought back tears while listening to the letter, and said he wasn't surprised that his wife would have organised such an elaborate gift.

'It's not surprising, because the last year and a half she's shown so many signs that she's there,' he said, adding that he saw a double rainbow the morning after she died and that 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' was her favourite song.

Touched: Mr Schmitz fought back tears during the radio segment, saying he wasn't suprised his wife had organised something like this

'There was no question that we were going to do something for this wish,' station manager Scott Allen told the Des Moines Register. 'It was what could we do that would be deserving of Brenda's name and memory.'

With the help of sponsors, the station was able to grant all three of Mrs Schmitz's wishes.

The family of eight will be treated to a vacation at Walt Disney World in Florida where Ms Abraham will relax with a spa day.

As for the nurses and doctors at Mercy Medical Center, they'll get get three coordinated food drops provided by a local catering company. 

Wish come true: The station got sponsors to grant all three of Brenda's wishes. The Schmitz family will be treated with a Disney World vacation, where Jayne will also receive a day at the spa
