The head of G4S stunned MPs yesterday by insisting his company was entitled to a £57million management fee – despite admitting its handling of the Olympic security contract was a 'humiliating shambles'.

Nick Buckles was accused of 'making it up as he went along' as he refused to back down on his claim that the private firm deserved to be paid for overseeing the fiasco.

But the 51-year-old chief executive did admit he was sorry and 'deeply disappointed' after it failed to deliver on its £284million deal.

Mr Buckles was forced to promise that 
police and the military would be reimbursed for providing thousands of 
troops and officers to plug the yawning security gap.

During 90 minutes of often 
excruciating evidence before the Home Affairs select committee, the G4S 
boss said the cost of accommodation for servicemen would also be covered
and bonuses would be paid to military personnel if deemed appropriate.

But even as he spoke there were claims
of another fiasco involving the company when just 30 security guards 
turned up for work at the Olympic road race cycling venue of Box Hill, 
Surrey, instead of the expected 300.

And a whistle-blower claimed that 
senior Games officials had agreed three months ago to downgrade the 
vetting of candidates in a desperate attempt to boost recruiting as it 
became clear that G4S was struggling to meet the numbers.

Astonishingly, that decision meant 
many of those safeguarding sensitive venues have a lower level of 
security clearance than some guards on basic  duties away from the 
Olympics, watching car parks and empty buildings.

The timing raises disturbing questions
for both the organising committee Locog and the Government about 
precisely when they were aware of the scale of G4S's recruitment 
failings.

I'm staying: Nick Buckles told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that he wouldn't resign

Mr Buckles was under intense pressure
to quit his £830,000-a-year job after members of the select committee 
ridiculed him and his company's performance.

Yet although G4S shares have fallen 17
per cent, wiping £700million from its market value, he maintained he is
the right man to lead the world's second-largest private-sector 
employer.

Senior security sources believe 
however that it is a matter of when, not if, Mr Buckles will be forced 
out but he will not go until after the Games, remaining as a potential 
'fall guy' if there is a major security failure.

Mr Buckles repeatedly said the 
company still intended to claim its £57million management fee for work 
over the past two years, even though it cannot provide anywhere near the
number of guards it had originally promised.

'We've managed the contract and we've 
had management on the ground for two years. We still expect to deliver a
significant number of staff to the Olympics.'

Committee chairman Keith Vaz said his
stance was 'astonishing' and called on G4S to waive the fee and any 
others associated with the contract.

The senior Labour MP repeatedly 
invited Mr Buckles to consider his position and claimed that G4S's 
Olympics performance had been 'unacceptable, incompetent and 
amateurish'.

Mr Buckles insisted: 'It's not about 
me; it's about delivering the contract. I'm the right person to ensure 
that happens ... clearly we regret signing the contract, but now we have
to get on and deliver it.'

He said there are 4,200 G4S staff 
working on the ground on the Olympics and the minimum the company will 
deliver is 7,000 – 70 per cent of what they were expected to provide.

Labour's David Winnick told the chief executive: 'It's a humiliating shambles, Mr Buckles.'

'I cannot disagree with you,' he 
replied. Tory MP Nicola Blackwood said Mr Buckles's performance before 
the MPs 'would lead quite a lot of people to despair'.

Labour MP Bridget Phillipson told Mr Buckles she was left with the feeling that he was 'making it up as you go along'.

Tory MP Michael Ellis added that the 
public was 'sick of huge corporations like yours thinking they can get 
away with everything'.

Mr Buckles said he told Locog on July
3 that his firm had experienced a shortfall in staff over the previous 
weekend, in part due to its scheduling system not working properly.

It was monitored daily at meetings 
with Locog and the Home Office but it was not until an Olympics Security
Board meeting eight days later – chaired by Charles Farr, director 
general of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism – that the firm
said it was not going to meet its contract obligations.

Mr Buckles refused to comment on whether Mr Farr should have referred the problems to ministers on July 3.

He said it was a 'complete and utter 
shock' when he was told on July 3, while on holiday in the U.S., that 
there would be problems delivering the contract.

He returned to the UK the same day, he
said. Mr Buckles conceded that he could not even guarantee how many 
security guards would turn up on the first day of the Olympics.

Olympic staff are now vetted only to 
Baseline Personnel Security Standard, which employers use as a basic 
measure to check the trustworthiness of staff.

This entry-level check takes one or 
two days to complete and includes a check for convictions on the Police 
National Computer. Introduced in 2009, it is the basic level of 
clearance for anyone who wants to work in a Government department.

It was originally intended that 
potential security staff would be checked to the 'industry standard' 
known as British Standard 7858, which can take up to five months.

This involves contacting all previous employers over the past five years.

Around 2,000 more servicemen and women
are on standby to protect the Olympics if G4S fails to provide enough 
guards by the opening ceremony on July 27.

Army, Royal Navy and RAF personnel 
have been warned they could be asked at short notice to scrap their 
summer holidays to plug any manpower gaps.
