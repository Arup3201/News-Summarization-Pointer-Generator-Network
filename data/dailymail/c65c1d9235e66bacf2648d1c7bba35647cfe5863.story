There really is no substitute for a mother's love, affection and protection.

A baby black bear cries in distress for its mother in West Milford, New Jersey as it is being taunted by some hunters in this fascinating but disturbing footage.

The young black bear is up a tree as the hunters watch the terrified animal and mock him in an undesirable and undignified manner. 

The male hunter, who records the footage, mockingly says, 'Do you want your mom? and he later adds, 'Come on down.'

The male hunter speaks behind the camera and says they are in West Milford with a wild bear.

Moments later he points towards the young black bear and says, 'He'd make a nice little coat.'

Shortly afterwards the female hunter says, 'Here he comes' as the baby black bear scampers down the tree and runs away to safety.

As he bear runs quickly into a forested area the man says, 'He's a motoring,'

Upset: The baby black bear is crying in the tree as the hunters approach him

Anxious: The young black bear looks out to see if it is safe to come down from the tree

Coming down: The baby black bear comes down from the tree and looks to escape from the hunters

Safety: The young bear runs very quickly down the tree and into a forested area
