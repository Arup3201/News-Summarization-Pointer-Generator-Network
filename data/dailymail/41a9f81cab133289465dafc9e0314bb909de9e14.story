Ordeal: Walter Crompton, 83, was held in a cell for seven hours and forced to give DNA samples as he was accused of poisoning his wife of 60 years Eileen

A grandfather arrested and banned from seeing his wife after he gave her a painkiller patch at her care home said last night he had been treated like ‘a hardened drug dealer’.

Walter Crompton, 83, had attached the prescription patch to her arm after she told him that she had been left in severe discomfort by arthritis.

But staff at Allendale Care Home, in Blackley, Manchester, where the dementia sufferer has been living, contacted police because the patch contained morphine.

Four days later Mr Crompton – who had been his wife Eileen’s only carer for 15 years before she became seriously ill and went into the home –  was arrested on suspicion of ‘administering a noxious substance’.

He was even locked up for seven hours in a police cell.

But only after a two-month police probe has he finally been cleared of wrongdoing.

Yesterday the RAF veteran – who has lost weight and struggled to sleep since his arrest – said: ‘This whole sorry business has been hanging over me for months and I think the way it has been dealt with is absolutely disgusting.

‘I’ve had a hell of a time and been treated as if I was like some kind of hardened drug dealer.

‘I’ve never committed a crime in my 83 years and for this to happen is mind-boggling.

‘For the police to say I’ve tried to harm my wife is unbelievable.

‘She had complained of arthritis in her arm and I said I had a pain patch in my pocket so I put it on her arm.

‘I used to look after her 24 hours a day so I know what she can and can’t have.’

He said: ‘I have never been in a cell before. I’ve only seen stuff like that on TV.

‘I never had anything to eat from morning to night when I was in the cell.’

Mr
 Crompton was asked to give fingerprints and a DNA sample and his house 
was searched, before he was interviewed by officers at midnight.

He 
was eventually released and taken home at 1am but as part of his bail 
conditions he was barred from contacting his wife of 60 years.

The 
retired British Aerospace aircraft engineer later had his bail 
conditions relaxed slightly so that he could see his wife – but only if 
accompanied by a social worker, who was not always available.

He added:
 ‘I’ve been missing my wife greatly because before of all this.

Alert: Staff at Allendale care home in Blackley, Manchester, alerted police after Mr Crompton went home

‘I used to be allowed see her every day but after my arrest I was told not to contact  her at all.

‘I was allowed to visit her later but only under supervision with someone watching over us.

‘Two
 or three days per week I had no one to go to the care home with me so I
 was restrained from seeing my wife. It was terrible. Then on Monday 
when I went to the police station they told me there was no case to 
answer.

‘They said all accusations had been dropped. Why couldn’t 
that have happened after two weeks? It’s been an absolutely horrendous 
three months.’

Instead, officers from the Greater Manchester Police
 Public Protection Investigation Unit started an investigation and a 
‘multi-agency strategy meeting’ was held.

Detective Superintendent 
Joanne Rawlinson said: ‘This was a potentially serious incident in 
which a vulnerable elderly woman with significant health issues could 
have come to serious harm and, as such,  people would expect the police 
to always conduct a thorough investigation.

‘An integral part of the 
inquiry was to safeguard the potential victim and, while the 
investigation was ongoing, bail conditions were necessary to ensure  
this happened.

‘After twice interviewing the 83-year-old man, we 
presented a file of evidence to the CPS and they ruled there is 
insufficient evidence to proceed to a charge.’

A spokesman for 
Allendale Care Home said: ‘We strictly follow the guidelines with 
regard to patient care and protection to ensure they receive the highest 
standard of care.’
