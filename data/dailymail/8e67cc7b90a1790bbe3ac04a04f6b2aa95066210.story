A rare, antique torpedo that was last fired almost 120 years ago has been uncovered at the bottom of the ocean - by a dolphin working for the US Navy.

The bottlenose, named Ten, found the brass relic, known as the Howell torpedo, during a routine patrol and reconnaissance training mission off the coast of California.

The US Navy employs dolphins - and some sea lions - to scour the depths for mines, shipwrecks and enemy divers.

But 19th century naval weaponry is a particularly rare find, especially one that has lain undisturbed on the ocean bed since 1895.

Military marvel: In its heyday, the 11-foot Howell torpedo was considered a masterpiece of innovation and one of the most technologically-advanced pieces of military hardware in the US Navy's arsenal

'We've never found anything like this,' Mike Rothe, who heads the dolphin search programme, told the Los Angeles Times. 'Never.'

In its heyday, the 11-foot Howell torpedo was considered a masterpiece of innovation and one of the most technologically-advanced pieces of military hardware in the US Navy's arsenal.

Fired from above water or through submerged torpedo tubes, it could cut silently through the water at speeds of 25 knots and sink an unsuspecting enemy warship from up to 700 yards away.

Only fifty were ever built by a Rhode Island company between 1870 and 1899, before it was outdated by another prototype made by a rival firm.

'Considering it was made before electricity was provided to US households, it was pretty sophisticated for its time,' Christian Harris, operations supervisor for the biosciences division at the Systems Center Pacific, told the LA Times.

Made of brass, the projectile was driven by a 132-pound flywheel spun to 10,000 rpm before launch.

After years of development, three prototypes were tested in 1885 in Newport Harbour.

Despite watching the first two grind to a halt and sink shortly after deployment, its makers returned to the drawing board and tweaked its mechanism.

Soon they were issued to the US Navy, becoming the first automobile torpedo issued to the fleet.

Until now, it was believed there was just one left in existence - on display at the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, Washington.

It is perhaps ironic that something seen at the time as an embodiment of technological advancement was discovered more than a century later by trained mammals and not state-of-the-art computers.

But the US Navy is increasingly turning to dolphins to search the ocean beds, because their on-board scanning systems remain unmatched by any man-made sonar.

Currently there are 80 bottlenosed dolphins and 50 sealions being trained at Point Loma facility for mine detection, mine clearing and swimmer protection.

Indeed, during the 2003 Iraq invasion, dolphins were dispatched to the Persian Gulf to hunt for mines and enemy divers. They are also used to guard submarines in Georgia and Washington State.

Experts say they are swifter and more accurate at detecting undersea objects than even the most sophisticated technology thanks to a keen eyesight and mysteriously-complex bio-sonar system.

'Dolphins naturally possess the most sophisticated sonar known to man,' Braden Duryee, an official at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific, told the LA Times.

To train them, sea wildlife experts drop objects of different shapes and sizes into the sea in areas of poor visibility.

If they find something they return to the surface and tap their snout on the front of the boat. If they find nothing they tap their snout on the stern.

Their first clue was when Ten the dolphin returned from a shallow dive and tapped the boat's bow. His handlers thought nothing of it. But when Ten's colleague Spetz did the exact same thing suspicions were aroused.

Navy divers dove to investigate the mysterious object, broken in two pieces, and found a stamp on one section that read: 'USN No. 24'.

It was carefully hauled to the surface and taken to the  Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington to be cleaned up.
