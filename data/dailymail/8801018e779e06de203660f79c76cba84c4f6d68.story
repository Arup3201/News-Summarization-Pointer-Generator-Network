After a month of festive indulgence, the majority of Brits are embarking on a New Year health regime - and fitness companies are coming up with inventive ways to keep us interested.

Virgin Active, for one, has created a brand new in-club experience it claims will help participants burn up to 900 calories in just half an hour.

But they're not promising it's easy, as they offer The Grid, an obstacle course that forces participants to undergo a series of high-intensity moves... one after the other.

Virgin Active's The Grid, offers a series of 30-minute, high-intensity classes based on circuit training

Instructors will make participants perform a series of 'primal' movements to tone muscles and build fitness

Forget staring into space as you run aimlessly on a treadmill; the The Grid promises to challenge participants in each of the six primal movements, to twist, pull, lift, bend, squat and lunge.

The workout has been broken down into four separate classes, each based on high-intensity training.

Trainers say the goal is that members can train for their specific needs, whether it's running for the bus or taking on a gruelling obstacle course such as Tough Mudder.

Each class - Fit, Lean, Strong or Active - involves short, sharp circuits, which focus on different parts of the body.

The Grid Fit class employs the 'accumulator principle' which means trainers crank up the intensity as it progresses to increase cardiovascular fitness, reduce body fat and improve muscle tone.

The 30-minute Grid Lean is based on Tabata, the four minute cardio routine. Based around high-intensity interval training, its designed to help burn calories, reduce body fat and build muscle.

The Grid offers four classes, Lean, Fit, Strong and Active, which all tackle different workout issues

For those who want to build up, the Grid Strong promises to improve elasticity and flexibility while creating muscle at the same time.

In Grid Active, the class uses the floor as an obstacle course, with participants forced to get through an obstacle to get to the next exercise.

Using weights and a large range of movements it claims to be the perfect way to train for increasingly popular challenges such as Tough Mudder.

The classes, which all last 30 minutes, could involve heaving tires, throwing ropes or doing press ups

Andy Birch, Head of Exercise & Wellbeing at Virgin Active said: 'When coming up with The Grid concept we wanted to bring consciousness back into the high intensity arena. 

'Being more mindful of our movement and drilling this down to help us achieve our goals is key. To bring this to life we wanted to reinvent how people use the equipment and space in our club.

'The Grid emerged as it allows us to programme better for people to move better in the toughest way to get the best results.'
