Steven Gerrard knows from bitter personal experience that the agony of failure at the World Cup can be hard to cleanse from your system. It takes time.

He has suffered it four times in his career, from the pain of missing out through injury in 2002, to the penalty shoot-out misery in Gelsenkirchen in 2006 and a crushing defeat at the hands of arch-rivals Germany in Bloemfontein four years later.

The disappointing performance of Roy Hodgson’s team this summer in Brazil is still raw. They are out after two games; the first time England have failed to progress beyond the group stage of the World Cup since 1958, and their shortest campaign since 1950.

Agony: England captain Steven Gerrard is still reeling from their World Cup exit

For Gerrard, it completes an unwanted set. There will be no World Cup glory for the 34-year-old Liverpool captain but he believes the young players in Hodgson’ s squad, many of whom are at their first major tournament, will learn from the experience.

'It’s a difficult one,' said Gerrard. 'The World Cup is a level where you don’t forget your experiences in two weeks, four weeks or a couple of months.

'They live with you for a long time.

'You have to accept that and try and move forward so that, if you’re picked for another tournament, your experiences are better.

Young Lions: Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw are set to start against Costa Rica

'I do think the youngsters here have that character. I’ve said how talented they are. They do the right things in and around training and they want to stay at this level for a long time.

'It will be better in two years because of the standard of players we have here.'

Some of those young players will be given their first taste of World Cup football in Belo Horizonte tomorrow when England contest their final Group D fixture against Costa Rica, who need only a point to win the group.

Southampton’s teenage full-back Luke Shaw and young Everton midfielder Ross Barkley are both expected to start, as is Jack Wilshere. Gerrard will take a rest and Frank Lampard will captain the team.
