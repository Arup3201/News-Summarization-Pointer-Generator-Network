The sister of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani has made an emotional plea for the judge not to halt the trial of Shrien Dewani without hearing the accused’s version of events.

Ami Denborg, the victim’s elder sister, said she and her family would never be able to ‘move on’ without hearing what businessman Mr Dewani had to say in his defence.

Judge Jeanette Traverso last week adjourned the trial in Cape Town for a fortnight to assess Mr Dewani’s claim that the case should be thrown out for lack of evidence because prosecution witnesses were unreliable.

Ami Denborg, right, wants the South African trial judge in her brother-in-law's murder trial to ensure that Shrien Dewani explains his side of the story on how his wife Anni, left, was killed in November 2010 

The judge is due to make a ruling on December 8 and supporters of Anni Dewani fear that she may clear the wealthy care home owner of all five charges relating to the murder of his wife on their honeymoon four years ago.

But Mrs Denborg, 37, an engineer, said: ‘What about us, as Anni’s family? We need to hear what he has to say.

‘We have been waiting for years, sitting through each and every hearing just to know what he can tell us about how Anni died.

‘At times, our patience has worn thin. But, as Anni’s family, we always believed it was important to maintain dignity and allow the courts of law to follow the full due process.

‘But I wonder how we are going to live our lives knowing that half of the story is missing?’ Mr Dewani, 34, denies any involvement in his wife’s murder in November 2010, two weeks after he married her in a £200,000 wedding in Mumbai. Anni was found dead after the taxi she was travelling in with her husband of two weeks was carjacked in a township on the outskirts of Cape Town.

Mr Dewani and the driver, Zola Tongo, were freed unharmed, while the 28-year-old bride was found the following morning with a single gunshot wound to her neck.

The Bristol businessman is alleged to have masterminded the hit on his wife after asking Tongo to stage a robbery and engage two gangsters to kill her. Mrs Denborg, speaking at her home in Stockholm, said: ‘We absolutely respect the judge and the court. However, it would just not be fair of her to make a judgment to end the case before she has heard everything.

‘There are inconsistencies in what Shrien has said to the police and to my family and these need to be cleared up, once and for all.

‘We heard from the three men who were in the taxi and who have been convicted and now we need to hear Shrien tell his story. As Anni’s family, we are never going to be able to move on unless we hear what he has to say about what happened.’

Mr Dewani fought a three-and-a-half-year legal battle to avoid extradition from Britain to South Africa after an arrest warrant was issued to take him back and put him on trial.

Mrs Denborg said: ‘We have always thought so highly about the South African justice system and it could be about to hit us in the face if it makes a judgment before hearing the case in full. I am totally devastated. I was at work and I couldn’t stop crying. It doesn’t feel fair.

‘If the judgment comes with her hearing the full story and he is declared innocent, then I would say, “Okay, he didn’t do it.” And it would be easier to accept.’

On the first day of the trial Mr Dewani confessed through lawyers to paying gay prostitutes for sex and declared himself bisexual. But a London-based rent boy and a senior Scotland Yard officer were banned from revealing details of Mr Dewani’s sex life by the judge and he has not yet been cross-examined.
