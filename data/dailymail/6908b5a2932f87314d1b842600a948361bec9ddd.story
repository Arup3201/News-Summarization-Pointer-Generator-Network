Andy Murray is set to confirm that he will be continuing his groundbreaking coaching arrangement with Amelie Mauresmo, despite his untimely quarter final exit from Wimbledon earlier this month.

Murray is more than a week into his mid-season training block in Miami and the 35 year-old former women’s number one has joined him as he prepares for next month’s hard court events leading into the U.S Open.

He is likely to end speculation by announcing in the next few days that their relationship will carry on after an initial spell working together during the four-week grass court season.

As Sportsmail first revealed, the plan was always for this to be a long-term deal with a trial period at first, rather than the other way round, and her presence in Florida appears to confirm the commitment on both sides.

It was thought the biggest stumbling block might be a reluctance to travel on her part. But it seems she has cut short her summer holiday to be with him ahead of the Canadian Open, his next tournament, which begins on August 4 in Toronto.

Murray has said that at times he may be willing to do training blocks nearer to where it might be convenient for her, but with the punishing conditions for the next few tournaments he was adamant he wanted to head to south Florida at this time of year.

Also in Miami are assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green, both of whom are known to have been unhappy at being kept out of the loop about his original plan to work with Mauresmo.

Their presence suggests that has been smoothed over, although there may be some small adjustments to the way his support staff operate in future, or its make-up, when the announcement is made.

Murray played beautifully at Wimbledon until putting in a bafflingly poor performance in the quarter final, albeit against an inspired Grigor Dimitrov. Combined with his unscheduled exit from the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club it did not add up to a dream start with Mauresmo, although he made clear from the outset that it would be too early to make an impact either way at Wimbledon.

Amid the fever of the fortnight there was much speculation about his reported cry in the quarter final referring to ‘five minutes before the match’, although I understand that he actually said ’45 minutes’ before the match, in reference to some technical instruction from his staff. Either way it has not been of any long-term importance.

Before taking a brief break prior to resuming training Murray made it clear he had enjoyed working with the former SW19 women’s champion, and now it seems he wants her to take him forward for a much longer period.

In some ways this is a good place for them to start in earnest together, as he is freed from the pressure of being Wimbledon champion, is over his back surgery, and has slipped back into the chasing pack with a world ranking of number ten.

He probably has a window of four or five years to add to his Grand Slam and Olympic haul, with no sign of the competition easing.

After losing at Wimbledon Murray suggested that he would be taking the forthcoming Masters level tournaments in Canada and Cincinatti more seriously than he has in the past, as arguably what hurt him most on the grass was his lack of big wins going into the tournament.

'It’s been a year since I won an event and the best way to prepare for majors is by winning a lot of matches and I have not done that,' he said. 'In Doha (January) I didn’t do that, I didn’t do that before the French, I didn’t win Queens.

'It hasn’t stopped me playing from having good runs in the Slams but to have great ones it helps if you have a good build-up.'
