It has five storeys, two kitchens and a private garage. At a first glance this period property is a steal at just £25,000.

However, don't get your cheque book out just yet because this promising property is nothing more than a children's dolls' house. 

The extravagant toy called Walton Park has individually laid parquet flooring, Nina Campbell wallpapers, hand-crafted furniture and remote control lighting.

Puts Barbie's dream house in the shade: Walton Park has been put on the market by Savills estate agent for the grand price of £25,000

The drawing room features gold silk curtains with a mini cream trim, an Aubusson rug, French furniture, a chandelier and dark wood flooring.

There is also a dining room, library, master bedroom, three further bedrooms, a bathroom, utility room and a garage.

In a Beatrix Potter themed nursery there are wooden floors, a luxury Moses basket, Dragons cot bed, toy box, chest of drawers and changer - all hand-painted in Potter's artwork.

If Walton Park was a real home in central London experts believe that it would set the buyer back £15 million plus £1.7m in stamp duty.

But the dolls' house, which took three months to make and weighs 160kg, is instead being marketed by Savills esate agents with a guide price of £25,000.

Attention to detail: The intricately furnished bedroom, top, and living room 

It was commissioned by Dragons of Walton Street, the children's interior specialist, and they will be donating 10 per cent of the sale proceeds to charity.

To promote it, Savills has put together the same sort of brochure they produce for a £50m mansion.

Charlie Bubear, head of Savills Chelsea, said that the extreme price tag of the dolls' house could be justified by the immaculate attention to detail that has gone into creating it.

'Walton Park has been finished to an exceptional standard, on a par with many of the prime properties we sell in Chelsea. If this was a real home on Gilston Road or The Little Bolton's I'd estimate it would total 4,198 sq ft with a capital value of £12.5m to £15m.'

Beautifully finished: If a real property like this were to go on sale in London experts believe it would fetch around £15m

Work began on Walton Park in August 2014, with an average of 35 separate interior design decisions needed for each of the 15 rooms, totalling 525 interior design choices.

The house certainly received its fair share in hours of labour with the parquet flooring alone taking 14 hours to sand, polish and complete. 

Lucinda Croft, managing director of Dragons of Walton Street, said the project had become all consuming over the past three months but says that it had been entirely worth it. 

'This has been a complete labour of love and everyone at Dragons has lived and breathed Walton Park for months. Everything may have been in miniature but there have been some pretty big headaches,' Lucinda said. 

Ready for Christmas: When the house does sell, ten per cent of the proceeds will be donated to charity
