Edwin 'Ed' Hale, Sr, sleeps on his 186-acre property over Chesapeake Bay with a sawed-off shotgun always within reach.

It's not burglars the former Bank of Baltimore chairman worries about at night, but enemies who may have learned he spent time working undercover for the CIA.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Hale, 68, broke his silence in a self-published book about his CIA work in a story similar to Hollywood spy Jack Ryan's escapades in 'Shadow Recruit.'

In from the cold: Former bank executive Ed Hale, 68, spoke about his work as a spy for the CIA, operating a dummy company for the agency and giving cover to operatives working abroad

Baltimore Magazine reports that Hale was recruited by 'Buzzy' Krongard back in 1992.

Krongard, the head of investment bank Alex. Brown who worked in the same office as Hale, also happened to be a banker working in the employ of the CIA.

After being recruited, Hale says he helped run a dummy company the CIA created under a legitimate corporation under his control that had shipping and trucking operations.

Hale traveled to countries including Saudi Arabia, Israel, Poland, Denmark and Norway to help provide cover to operatives supposedly working for the company.

Hale's role, which was never officially associated with the US government, was key during a campaign in the 1990s when the CIA was conducting early investigations on Osama bin Laden.

During operations, he would know only the agents' names and destinations, though he often communicated with a handler from the agency.

Hale said he'd become a 'little nervous' his name would be revealed when agents did not return from missions at the pre-determined time, though he believes none were ever caught.

Though rarely in danger, Hale said he once had a close shave with Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, while in Jerusalem.

'I was in Israel with one of the agents, and he was on his way to other places in the Middle East,' he told Baltimore Magazine. 

'I was at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, and they came in and grabbed me out of a meeting and took me and interrogated me and let me go because I was not there for Israel, I was there shepherding somebody through into other countries,' he added.

Coming clean: Hale recruited Baltimore journalist Kevin Cowherd to write the book that revealed the secrets about his CIA work

The work stopped after September 11, 2001, when Hale says the agency no longer needed him, though he is still in communication with two of the agents he worked with.

Part of the reason to commission the book, which was written by Baltimore journalist Kevin Cowherd and titled Hale Storm, was to give his children a reason for his absence during their childhood.

'I want my kids to know where I was and what I did,' he said, and both him and his two daughters say the book helped improve their relationship.

'It was very cathartic,' he said about the book, which has sold around 600 copies so far. 'To hold a secret like that for so long to yourself, it was difficult.'

The man who brought him into the spy agency was less pleased for the Hale family after the revelation.

'I am disappointed and upset that Ed would violate his agreement and understanding with the agency,' Krongard told the Journal.

Hale is the owner of professional indoor soccer team Baltimore Blast and started the barge and trucking companies Port East Transfer and Hale Container Line. 

He said he entered banking after the Bank of Baltimore turned him down for a loan, which raised his hackles due to the 'snooty blue-blood culture' of the industry.

Afterwards, in 1991, a friend urged him to spend $1.4million on a successful proxy fight that put Hale in the position of chief executive of Bank of Baltimore.
