Exiles from Cuba's communist revolution are fighting for the right to seize billions of dollars of Cuban money held in frozen U.S. bank accounts.

Gustavo Villoldo, 78, and the families of fellow Cuban Aldo Vera and Bobby Fuller, an American, each won separate lawsuits in Florida seeking billions of dollars in damages from the Cuban government.

The fight now, though, is less with Cuba than it is with the banks where the U.S. Treasury froze Cuban government assets that the families now want to seize.

Cuban exile Gustavo Villoldo, 78, in an interview in his lawyer's office in Miami. He and the families of two men allegedly killed by Cuba are moving closer to collecting billions of dollars linked to the Cuban regime 

The banks are resisting turning the money over, insisting the U.S. families have yet to prove they should be allowed to seize it.

Mr Villoldo has been an avowed enemy of the Cuban government since the day in 1959 that, he says, agents of the communist regime blackmailed his father into committing suicide.

His anti-Castro missions have included co-piloting a B-26 bomber during the ill-fated 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion as well as infiltrating Cuba for the CIA numerous times.

He even helped with tracking down Fidel Castro lieutenant Ernesto 'Che' Guevara in Bolivia in 1967, where the revolutionary was secretly murdered.

That was Mr Villoldo's revenge. The basis of his lawsuit, which won him $2.8billion in damages from Cuba, was that Guevara had ordered his father to take his own life or his sons would be killed.

Earlier this year, Manhattan U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ruled that the Florida decisions must be honoured as attorneys for Mr Villoldo and the others try to get at accounts with ties to Cuba held by the 19 banks, including Bank of America, Barclays Bank, Citibank, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase.

'The judgments granted by the Florida circuit court in favor of the plaintiffs and against Cuba are entitled to full faith and credit,' Judge Hellerstein wrote in an August 22 order.

At stake is as much as $3.5 billion; the families have agreed to share any proceeds they get out of the New York accounts.

Mr Villoldo's attorney, Andrew Hall, who previously represented Watergate figure John Erlichman and families of sailors killed in the USS Cole terror attack, said the Hellerstein ruling was a watershed moment in the case.

The exact contents of the accounts and the account holders are sealed by court order, and the legal question now involves whether the money truly belongs to Cuba.

'That's the battle: Is this Cuba's money or is this someone else's money?' Mr Hall said. 'This is the green light that opens the door for us.'

In a nutshell, the money was halted by the Treasury Department as it passed back and forth electronically through the New York banks between entities in Cuba and banks in other countries overseas.

Based on the rulings so far, Hall estimated more than $20million could be paid out by the banks within the next six months.

Another $20million to $40million, he said, could be obtained depending on upcoming legal decisions on precisely when an electronic funds transfer, or EFT, should be considered Cuban property that could be seized.

In October, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that EFTs were subject to seizure only if Cuba itself, or a state-owned entity, transmitted the funds directly to the bank.

Lawyers on all sides are still sorting out that decision's impact. An attorney for several big banks, James Kerr, suggested that no money be turned over to Villoldo and the other families right away.
