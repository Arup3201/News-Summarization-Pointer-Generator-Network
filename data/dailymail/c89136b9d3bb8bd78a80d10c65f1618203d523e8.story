A hapless hold-up crook was arrested minutes after he fled a bank with a sackful of cash - straight back to his apartment next door.

Jobless Gerhard Andexer, 35, confessed to police in Wiener Neustadt, Austria, that he'd been desperate for money to pay bills and give his wife and three children a happy Christmas.

Police raided his apartment when astonished witnesses said they'd seen the gunman run in through the front door.

Hapless: Andexer was arrested with thousands of Euros in a bank cash bag, the note he'd given cashiers, his mask and even the children's toy gun he'd used in the robbery

Andexer was arrested with thousands of Euros in a bank cash bag, the note he'd given cashiers, his mask and even the children's toy gun he'd used in the robbery.

Police spokeswoman Manuela Weinkirn said: 'He was masked and demanded the money using a note.

'When he left he told bank staff not to call the police because he had a bomb.

'He managed to escape with several thousand euros but he didn't have it for very long.'

Desperate: Family man Andexer, right, told police he was driven to crime after wife Petra, left, gave birth to their third child recently

With his eldest son: He told police that he'd been desperate for money to pay bills and give his wife and three children a happy Christmas

Family man Andexer - now in custody - told police he was driven to crime after wife Petra gave birth to their third child recently.

He wrote on his Facebook page: 'My motto is that every day not spent with family where you can tell them that you love them is a day that is wasted.'

The luckless crook also wrote: 'You can't catch luck, you either have it or you don't. It is like glass - if you hold it too tightly you break it.

'It is like a flower - if you don't care for it it wilts and dies. I am a happy person and I love to laugh, I love to have fun.'
