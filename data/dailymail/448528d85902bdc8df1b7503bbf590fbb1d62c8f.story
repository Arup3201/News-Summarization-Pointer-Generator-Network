Anthony Brumwell (pictured), from Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, was jailed for three years and two months after he spent £15,000 of his grandmother's savings

A man with an addiction to chat lines has been jailed after using his grandmother's savings to fund his habit.

Anthony Brumwell, who has previously defrauded other members of his family, spent £15,000 of his grandmother's savings and extended her overdraft. 

He left the 74-year-old at risk of eviction due to rent arrears that accrued through his activities, Durham Crown Court heard.

Her life insurance was also cancelled as her accounts dried up, leaving her with 'significant worry and confusion'.

Ian Mullarkey, prosecuting, said the issue came to light when a £5,000 loan application was posted to Brumwell's father, despite carrying the defendant's phone number.

Other family members quickly checked his grandmother's finances and realised what was happening. Her reaction was: 'He's cleaned me out again.'

While the 31-year-old was on bail for theft and fraud against his grandmother he turned his attention to employer Start Energy, for whom he was account manager.

Brumwell, from Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, set up a bogus £10,400 'deal' through the Peterlee-based business for an electricity meter for another company. 

But he gave his own bank details on invoices for payments.

Mr Mullarkey said this caused Start Energy major difficulties as the other company cancelled a large contract, resulting in the loss of four jobs.

The court heard his financial difficulties began when he started using premium rate chat lines as a teenager, taking out payday loans to try to meet his debts along with the cost of everyday living.

Shaun Dryden, mitigating, said Brumwell was spending up to £1,000 a month on the chat lines, which can cost between 41p and £2.50 per minute. 

Judge Simon Hickey told 31-year-old Brumwell at Durham Crown Court (above): 'Your actions are said to have broken your grandmother's heart'

He said: 'This is on top of bills and rent, and there is a point where he could not fund what he was spending.'

Brumwell admitted charges of fraud against his grandmother and employer, plus attempted theft.

Judge Simon Hickey jailed Brumwell for three years and two months.

He said: 'Your actions are said to have broken your grandmother's heart.

'The tragedy is that that generous lady would have given you the money if you asked.'

Judge Hickey added that, given the defendant's circumstances, compensation was 'unrealistic'.
