Mother-of-one Jayne, 47, was driving to work when she was killed

Nurses have been hit with £70 parking fines after they left their cars on the side of the road when a colleague was killed near the hospital gates.

Dozens of health staff driving to work were held up by the tragic road accident where hospital cook Jayne Parker was killed.

The dedicated staff - including doctors and nurses - parked at the roadside to walk to the hospital to care for patients.

But when they returned to their cars, they were outraged to see parking tickets slapped onto their windscreens.

The workers at Singleton Hospital, Swansea, were still reeling from the shock of Jayne's death when they were hit with the £70 parking fines.

A hospital spokesman said: 'Our staff's overriding priority was to get to work on time, which demonstrates their commitment to providing care to patients.

'We can confirm a number of staff who were not able to access the hospital staff car park did receive parking tickets.

'We have contacted Swansea Council, explaining the extenuating circumstances, and asked for the tickets to be voided.'

The main road leading to the 550-bed hospital was closed by police after the fatal crash earlier this week.

Mother-of-one Jayne, 47, was driving to work when her car was in a collision with a Seat Leon coming the other way.

Health chiefs said she had worked as a hospital cook for 22 years and was a dedicated and loyal member of staff.

Swansea Council said it was investigating the parking tickets which were issued in the hours after the crash.

A spokesman said: 'We are already in talks with the health board to get details of the staff who were affected by this and we'd expect to cancel their tickets.'
