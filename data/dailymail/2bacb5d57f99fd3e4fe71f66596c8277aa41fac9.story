It features in one of the most famous movie scenes of all time - and now it could be yours.

The car in which Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's characters travelled in to the airport for Casablanca's immortal finale is going under the hammer next month.

The 1940 Buick Phaeton - which belonged to Bogart's character Rick Blaine in the 1942 film - is expected to fetch $500,000 (£312,000) at auction in New York on November 25.

Here's looking at you kid: The car owned by Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca is to go up for auction in New York next month

Iconic: The car features in the film's immortal final scene in which Bogart's character utters the famous line 'Here's looking at you kid' to Ingrid Bergman's character for the final time

Immortal scene: The Buick can just be seen in the background as the camera zooms in on Bogart and Bergman for the finale of the film

It is among a number of iconic movie props and costumes being sold off as part of the Dreams Are Made of This auction at Bonhams.

This car looms large in the final act of Casablanca: Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault drives the car to the airport at gunpoint, with Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine in the front, and Ingrid Bergman playinng Isla Lund and Paul Henried as Victor Laszlo in the back seat.

Throughout the final moments of the film, Rick, Ilsa, Victor and Louis linger on the airport tarmac next to the Buick Phaeton, and the film's immortal final moments between Rick and Ilsa take place next to the car.

The 1940 Buick Phaeton Limited 81C convertible is expected to fetch $500,000 (£312,000) at auction. But what will you get for your money: 

The car can be seen in the background as Bogart looks into Bergman's crying eyes and utters arguably the most famous movie quote of all time: 'Here's looking at you kid.'

Despite being 73-years-old the car, 
which as part of Warner Brother's fleet it featured in several other 
films including High Sierra, also starring Bogart, only has 42,000 miles
on the clock.

The car itself would be ultra-rare even if its wasn't attached to Bogart's star status.

Only
230 Buick Model 81C trunkback convertible Phaetons were built in 1940 -
and similar Buicks from that time period have sold for around $500,000 
(£311,000), so Bogart's could go for higher.

The
car was originally bought from Warner Brother's by famed ukelele player
Lyle Ritz in 1970 before being sold at auction twice since.

It was last auctioned off in 1995.

The auction has been put together with television channel Turner Classic Movies.

Stunning: The interior of the car is a beautiful mix of beige and brown

Famous passengers: Ingrid Bergman's character sat on the back seat of the car in the film. The original interior is slightly damaged say auctioneers

Other
lots include a pair of Laurel and hardy derby hats expected to fetch up
to $20,000, costumes worn by Cary Grant and Bette Davis and even a 
Batman suit worn by Michael Keaton in Batman Returns in 1992.

Star: Humphrey Bogart starred in the much loved 1942 film

Catherine
Williamson, Bonhams' director of entertainment memorabilia, said: 'We 
worked with Turner Classic Movies to reach out to some of the best 
collectors in the country and to curate, really, an auction that runs 
the gamut of film history.

'We hold memorabilia auctions pretty regularly, but this is the first time we've partnered with someone like them.

'They
are the best possible partner we could have. They really are carrying 
the torch forward in terms of evangelizing the love of classic movies.'

Ben
Mankiewicz, Turner Classic Movies host, said of the Model 81C Aztec 
brown convertible Phaeton: 'Seeing it in a catalogue is not the same. I 
knew the car was here, and I walk in and it still takes your breath away
a little bit.

'I'm as amazed as, I think, anybody else is here.'

Casablanca had its world premiere on November 26 1942 in New York and was released nationwide in the US in January 1943.

It had a solid, if unspectacular initial run - the film was rushed out to take advantage of the Allied invasion of North Africa several weeks earlier.

It won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture and now regularly features near the top of lists of the greatest films of all time.
