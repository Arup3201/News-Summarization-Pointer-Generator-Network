She's known for her straight-talking on The Hotel Inspector and The Fixer.

And even when eight months pregnant with her second child, Alex Polizzi admits maternity leave can be really 'hard' on employers.

The hotelier, who is expecting her second child, tells the new issue of the Radio Times: 'I absolutely think of myself as a 
feminist but it's quite hard to run a business around people who are 
constantly off on maternity leave, and may or may not come back.

'The Government pays, so it's not the 
money, it's just difficult to find very good people to fill a position 
that's supposed to be temporary.

'So I think some of it is a natural result of biology and some of it is just because we're not given a bloody chance.'

Alex herself has to balance being mother to four-year-old daughter Olga with her TV shows and running her 
wholesale bakery with her husband Marcus Miller.

The 41-year-old admits it's difficult juggling everything, but she refuses to feel guilty about being a working mother.

She explained: 'I feel no guilt at all at leaving my 
daughter.

'Last week somebody said, "Poor you" to me as I peeled her 
clinging hands from me. "She’ll get over it," I replied. "She’ll go to 
school and forget in two minutes flat."

'It’s
all done in an attempt to make me feel guilty and I refuse!

'I do the 
best I can. My daughter knows that. My husband knows that. They just have to get on with it.'

Having employees on maternity leave generally affects small businesses far more than large organisations employing tens of thousands of people.

Pregnant workers are entitled to 52 weeks of Statutory Maternity Leave, no matter how long they have been with an employer, how many hours they work or how much they are paid.

Employers are unable to change the employee’s contract terms and conditions without agreement during maternity leave - if they do, they are in breach of contract.

If they take on a temporary worker to fill a gap, the new employee is entitled to full employment rights after 12 weeks' work, according to EU rules.

Any mother who decides they no longer want to return to their full contractual hours can tell their employer up to eight weeks before they return to work and the employer must endeavour to accommodate any request for part-time flexible working.
