Ian Thorpe's manager said the Olympic champion is expected to be released from hospital 'in days' in a rare piece of good news for the swimming world.

Thorpe, 31, has been battling a severe infection in a Sydney hospital since a major shoulder operation in late February and was undergoing 'around-the-clock' medical care.

On Tuesday evening, Thorpe's manager Will Erskine revealed his client had all but conquered the mystery superbug and planned to leave hospital soon.

Sunny skies: Ian Thorpe, 31, will be out of hospital in days, his manager said

'He's doing well, he's recovered very well in fact,' Mr Erskine told MailOnline.

'He's due to get out of hospital very soon...as in days. He's got on top of the infection.

'There's obviously still a lot of structural damage which might require future surgery for future surgeries but he's in a lot better shape than he was a few weeks ago.'

Mr Erskine said the five-time Olympic gold medalist and world record holder would first be checked in to a 'mental health facility' for treatment of his depression and then planned to resume a number of media commitments.

Things first started turning pear-shaped for Thorpe when a shoulder operation, believed to have been carried out in Bankstown, was botched in late January.

He required a number of 'repeat' surgeries and picked up a superbug around a month later. There was at the time a 'miniscule' chance doctors would have to amputate Thorpe's arm to save him from the infection.

In early February the troubled superstar was found wandering in a 'dazed and disoriented state' by police in Panania, in Sydney's west.

He has battled depression since the early 2000s, his autobiography revealed.

Thorpe's manager would not comment directly on the plight of Geoff Huegill - charged with possession of an illicit drug on Saturday - but said it was not an ideal look for the sport of swimming.

'It's obviously an unfortunate situation,' Mr Erskine said.

'It's something that doesn't help put focus on the sport for Swimming Australia.'

Huegill and his wife Sara will face Waverly local court on May 14.
