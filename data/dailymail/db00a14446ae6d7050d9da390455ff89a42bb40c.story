Thousands of young jobless Europeans are being offered £1,000 in taxpayers’ cash to come and work in Britain.

The European Commission will pay £250 towards the cost of crossing the continent for an interview and £830 in moving expenses if they get a job.

Critics will ask why Brussels is offering to subsidise unemployed Europeans to travel to the UK when nearly a million young Britons are without work here.

Controversial: Thousands of young jobless Europeans are being offered £1,000 in taxpayers' cash to come and work in Britain

The scheme, which aims to match jobseekers with suitable jobs, is being piloted in Spain, where youth unemployment exceeds 50 per cent.

The young jobless from Germany, Denmark 
and Italy are also set to benefit – with the plan likely to be rolled 
out across the entire EU.

In this financial year alone, some 5,000 people are expected to profit from the ‘Your First EURES Job’ scheme, run by EURES – the European Employment Services.

Its website says the scheme could soon be open to ‘all young people aged 18 to 30, nationals of any of the EU 27 member states and legally resident in any of the EU 27 member states who wish to find a job in a member state other than their country of residence’.

Participation is open to the under-30s ‘irrespective of their level of qualification, work experience or social and economic background’.

‘The purpose of Your First EURES Job is to make it easier for young people to access actual jobs and for employers to find the workforce they are unable to find at local, regional or national level,’ said the website. 

It adds that jobseekers can claim 1,000 euros from the European Commission – £830 – if they get a job in Britain.

Worries: Critics will ask why Brussels is offering to subsidise unemployed Europeans to travel to the UK when nearly a million young Britons are without work here

Critics fear it will see an influx of youngsters from countries with high unemployment, such as  Spain and Greece, flocking to the UK. Earlier this month David Cameron said he wanted a crackdown on the free movement of workers across the EU.

He said: ‘I believe in the single market, I believe in free movement.But you know, two weeks ago, I visited two factories in a week, and I asked the question, “How many people do you employ from other EU countries, what’s the balance?”.

‘In one, it was 60 per cent; in the other it was 50 per cent. Now, heaven’s above, we have got so many unemployed people in our country that we want to train and educate and give apprentices to and get back into work.’

Official figures show there are 2.53million unemployed in the UK, including almost one million jobless young adults.

Long-term youth unemployment has been steadily rising for the last 18 months.

Tim Aker, from the Get Britain Out campaign, said the fact that the scheme was taxpayer-funded was ‘astonishing’. ‘No wonder we’re all fed up with the EU,’ he said.

‘Mass unemployment caused by the eurozone is the eurozone’s problem. The EU shouldn’t undercut British workers by offering British jobs to unemployed Europeans.’

The Department for Work and Pensions said the scheme, also open to young Britons who want to move to other EU countries, tried to avoid sectors with ‘high unemployment’.
