The husband of a mother-of-two found strangled on the back seat of her Mercedes Benz has reportedly failed a lie detector test.

Bob Bashara, who gave a series of emotional interviews following the discovery of his wife's body, is a 'person of interest', police said.

The body of marketing executive Jane, 56, was found by a trucker eight miles from her Grosse Point Park, Michigan home on Wednesday morning.

'Person of interest': Bob Bashara has reportedly failed a lie detector test during four hours of police interrogation. His wife was found strangled in her car

Her husband of 26 years was interrogated by police for four hours on Friday, ABC 7 reported. During that time he took a polygraph test.

While Bashara, 54, is not being treated as a suspect, he is the only person of interest, police said.

Investigators have searched the family's home and seized computer hard drives. Cadaver dogs also sniffed through the house for evidence.

'He has continued to cooperate with our investigation. He is a person of interest within our investigation,' police chief David Hiller told WJBK.

'The evidence seized at the home will be turned over to our detectives and investigators for their review.'

Mrs Bashara's body was found in her car parked in an alley in east Detroit, although police said they do not think she was killed in the vehicle.

Her cellphone and purse were found close by - but Mr Bashara has said his wife would have had no reason to be in the area.

She had last spoken to her husband on her way home from work on Tuesday,

 told police he returned to home around 8 p.m. to find the TV on and 
that her work ID was there - suggesting she had made it home.

'I got home and she wasn’t around and I relaxed and figured she was out running an errand,' Bob Bashara told 7 Action News on Thursday.

'As 9:00 and 9:30 approached, I became much more concerned and I got more people involved,' he said. 'I called my kids to see if they had heard from her and they hadn’t.

'I had been calling her cell phone to find out and then as time got on I involved the police because I was concerned there might be something wrong.'

After friends and relatives told him they had not seen her, Bashara reported her missing.

Speaking to the Detroit Free Press last week, he said: 'I have no clue. Someone obviously had made their way into her car or attacked her and 
did what they did to her and dropped her, stashed her car somewhere.

'My heart is broken, and I'm very sad. And it's terrible to think what she had to go through
 in the last moments of her life.'

No motive has been suggested for the brutal murder of Jane - who has been described as a beloved wife and mother-of-two.

'Emotional': Bashara had given a series of interviews following the discovery

Jane Bashara worked as a senior marketing manager at Kema Services, an energy consulting and testing and certification company.

The Detroit News reports that Bob Bashara is president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club and was involved in various charities.

'They were just a great couple,' neighbour Alex Jones told ABC 7. 'It's hard on their kids to hear something like that. There’s no doubt in my mind that it was not him.'
