The Brisbane apartment where Marcus Volke murdered his transgender wife, dismembered her body and cooked her remains is now on the rental market.

Volke killed his Indonesian wife and sex worker, Mayang Prasetyo, in October last year in their apartment on Commercial Road in Teneriffe in Brisbane's inner-city.

The brutal crime ended with Volke - who was a male escort - taking his own life in a nearby industrial bin.

The couple met Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome while they were both working as escorts in 2009

The property was listed online in late February as a ‘fully furnished apartment’ looking to fetch $500 a week for rent.

The advertisement has since been removed however it is still believed to be available upon private inquiry. Four other apartments in the complex are currently being advertised.

Eerie photos of the apartment feature a shot of the stove Mr Volke used to boil the remains of his deceased partner.

Properties like Volke’s that have an unsavoury past are more commonly referred to as ‘stigmatised properties’.

If these walls could talk: As the apartment was the site of a brutal murder it is classed as a stigmatised property

Properties are considered stigmatised if a murder, suicide, death from natural causes, violent crime or drug related offence took place on the property. It can even be considered stigmatised if the previous owners believed the house was haunted.

While real estate agents are not obligated to advertise events that have occurred in the property, they must disclose the information to interested parties. 

Stigmatised: The real estate agent was asking for around $500 for the 'fully furnished' apartment

This isn’t the first property in recent times to come on the market with a dark past.

In Sydney’s Hyde Park, the luxurious apartment where Simon Gittany murdered his fiancé Lisa Harnam failed to sell despite expectations it would be picked up for more than $2 million dollars.

The remains of Ms Prasetyo were found cooking inside a Teneriffe apartment - in Brisbane's inner-city - in Ocrober of last year.

Volke fled the scene when police showed up at the couple's home and was later found with his throat slashed and a knife in an industrial bin nearby.
