British researchers have revealed the street of a lost medieval town dubbed 'Britain's Atlantis', for the first time.

The team from the University of Southampton used advanced 3D scanning to reveal the port town of Dunwich.

Present day Dunwich is a village 14 miles south of Lowestoft in Suffolk,
 but it was once a thriving port – similar in size to 14th Century 
London until coastal erosion left it 10M underwater.

Present day Dunwich is a village 14 miles south of Lowestoft in Suffolk,
 but it was once a thriving port – similar in size to 14th Century 
London.

Extreme storms forced coastal erosion and flooding that have 
almost completely wiped out this once prosperous town over the past 
seven centuries.

This process began in 1286 when a huge storm swept much
 of the settlement into the sea and silted up the Dunwich River.

This 
storm was followed by a succession of others that silted up the harbour 
and squeezed the economic life out of the town, leading to its eventual 
demise as a major international port in the 15th Century.

It now lies 
collapsed and in ruins in a watery grave, three to 10 metres below the 
surface of the sea, just off the present coastline.

Funded and supported by English Heritage, the project led by Professor 
David Sear has produced the most accurate map to date of the town’s 
streets, boundaries and major buildings, and revealed new ruins on the 
seabed.

'Visibility under the water at Dunwich is very poor due to the muddy water.

'This has limited the exploration of the site.

'We
 have now dived on the site using high resolution acoustic 
imaging to examine the ruins on the seabed – a first use of this 
technology for non-wreck marine archaeology.

'The technology is rather like shining a torch onto the seabed, 
only using sound instead of light.

'The data produced helps us to not 
only see the ruins, but also understand more about how they interact 
with the tidal currents and sea bed.'

The project to survey the underwater ruins of Dunwich, the world’s 
largest medieval underwater town site, began in 2008.

Six additional 
ruins on the seabed and 74 potential archaeological sites on the 
seafloor have since been found.

Combining all known archaeological data 
from the site, together with old charts and navigation guides to the 
coast, it has also led to the production of the most accurate and 
detailed map of the street layout and position of buildings, including 
the town’s eight churches.

Professor Sear said 'It is a
 sobering example of the relentless force of nature on our island 
coastline. It starkly demonstrates how rapidly the coast can change, 
even when protected by its inhabitants.'Global climate change 
has made coastal erosion a topical issue in the 21st Century, but 
Dunwich demonstrates that it has happened before.

'The severe storms of 
the 13th and 14th Centuries coincided with a period of climate change, 
turning the warmer medieval climatic optimum into what we call the 
Little Ice Age.

'Our coastlines have always been changing, and 
communities have struggled to live with this change. Dunwich reminds us 
that it is not only the big storms and their frequency – coming one 
after another, that drives erosion and flooding, but also the social and
 economic decisions communities make at the coast.

'In the end, with the 
harbour silting up, the town partly destroyed, and falling market 
incomes, many people simply gave up on Dunwich.'

Peter Murphy, English Heritage’s 
coastal survey expert who is currently 
completing a national assessment of coastal heritage assets in 
England,said : 'The loss of most of the medieval town of Dunwich over 
the last 
few hundred years – one of the most important English ports in the 
Middle Ages – is part of a long process that is likely to result in more
 losses in the future.

'Everyone was surprised, though, by how much of 
the eroded town still survives under the sea and is identifiable.

'Whilst
 we cannot stop the forces of nature, we can ensure what is significant 
is recorded and our knowledge and memory of a place doesn’t get lost 
forever.

'Professor Sear and his team have developed techniques that will
 be valuable to understanding submerged and eroded terrestrial sites 
elsewhere.'

Present day Dunwich is a village 14 miles south of Lowestoft in Suffolk,
 but it was once a thriving port – similar in size to 14th Century 
London.

Extreme storms forced coastal erosion and flooding that have

and squeezed the economic life out of the town, leading to its eventual 
demise as a major international port in the 15th Century.

The team found six additional ruins on the seabed and 74 potential archaeological sites on the seafloor have since been found. They include:

• Identification of the limits of the 
town, which reveal it was a substantial urban centre occupying 
approximately 1.8 km2 – almost as large as the City of London

• Confirmation the town had a central area enclosed by a defensive, possibly Saxon earthwork, about 1km2

•
 The documentation of ten buildings of medieval Dunwich, within this 
enclosed area, including the location and probable ruins of Blackfriars 
Friary, St Peter’s, All Saint’s and St Nicholas Churches, and the Chapel
 of St Katherine

• Additional ruins which initial interpretation suggests are part of a large house, possibly the town hall

•
 Further evidence that suggests the northern area of the town was 
largely commercial, with wooden structures associated with the port

• The use of shoreline change analysis to predict where the coastline was located at the height of the town’s prosperity

It now lies 
collapsed and in ruins in a watery grave, three to 10 metres below the 
surface of the sea, just off the present coastline.
