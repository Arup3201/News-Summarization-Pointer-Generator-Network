The 38-year-old photographer, from New Hampshire, tracked a storm as it moved across Arizona's most famous landmark, which is considered one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.

He watched in awe as a series of bolts surged down from the clouds -Â  lashing against the rocks and lighting up the surrounding landscape.

'The Grand Canyon is awe-inspiring at the best of times, let alone during a storm,' said Mr Roe.

'I've
 been to the Grand Canyon specifically to shoot lightning photos in past
 years and the weather conditions for getting lightning shots were the 
best I've seen there that night.'

Mr Roe, who has 20 years' photography experience, said the risk of being struck by a lighting bolt is always present during his shoots.

'Getting struck by lightning is something I'm mindful of, 
especially when standing next to an all metal camera tripod,' he said.

Landmark: The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, 18 miles wide and a mile deep. It was created at least 17 million years ago

'I've
 shot lightning in other locations where I've had some close strikes 
that got my attention. However, that night at the Grand Canyon, I thankfully 
didn't have any lightning strikes that needed me to take shelter.'

The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, 18 miles wide and a mile deep.

It was created at least 17 million years ago as the Colorado River and its tributaries sliced through layer after layer of rock cutting their channels while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted.
