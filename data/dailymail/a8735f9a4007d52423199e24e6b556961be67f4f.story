As party season approaches so does the prospect of squeezing into a slinky festive dress.

For some of us, slimming into an outfit at this time of indulgence is an unappealing option, so we look to shapewear to suck in the bits we can't face dieting away.

Here at FEMAIL we've compiled the best shapewear and party dress solutions to address all your issues, so you can tuck into another mince pie without fearing the cling.

Expert lingerie and shapewear fitter helps find best Spanx solution

Make
sure you wear the right size. If you are in the right fit, they should 
not roll, ride or pinch. Often women think that sizing down
drastically will give extra compression and thus a more slimming effect, but it often 
sacrifices fit and comfort.

@highlight

While some women think they only need one 
piece of shapewear, that is not the case. Think of it like shoes - you 
need different styles for different outfits and occasions.

@highlight

Do not
wear a mid-thigh shaper with trousers. Go with a style that does not 
stop on the thigh and create a line.
For skirts and dresses, choose a mid-thigh silhouette.
