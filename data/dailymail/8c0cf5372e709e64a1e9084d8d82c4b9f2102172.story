No-one dares to cross Maria Cristerna, dubbed The Vampire Lady. 

The 35-year-old who grew up in a deeply religious family is covered head-to-toe in tattoos, had dental work so she appeares to have fangs and has even had titanium horns inserted into her head. 

People used to walk on the other side of the road when they saw her coming.

But the former lawyer turned video jockey has said she has always been different.

Miss Cristerna grew up and still lives in Guadalajara, Mexico, one of the most notorious ghetto neighbours in the country where violent gang culture is rife.

She also endured many years of domestic abuse. 

But that has not stopped Miss Cristerna being the person she wants to be.

Despite her striking looks, the mother-of-four gives talks on domestic violence to women who have suffered the same ordeal as her in the city.

A close friend said: 'In the early days local people and anyone from the community would cross the street when she passed, making cross gestures as if she was the devil or was possessed.

'People feared her immensely and were understandably intimidated by her presence. 

'Many thought she was on drugs or crazy! But now they kiss her hand when they meet her. 

'Many almost worship her and take her blessings like she is some kind of goddess with mystical powers.'

Miss Cristerna is in Vienna, Austria, this weekend taking part in an event called Wildstyle - a tattoo convention.

Miss Cristerna said: 'I am expressing beauty through my art for the world to see.

'God lives inside of me and I believe it is what I do daily for others and my actions that make me who I am, not how I look or my appearance.

People used to cross the street when they saw Maria coming but now she is treated like a goddess among her neighbours

'Yes I like people to look at me but I am a product of my experiences and what I have seen around me since very young. I have always been different!

'We all have the power to change the world if that is what we choose to do.

'Even if it is just changing your own world or circumstances. We have the power within us all'.

Human evolution and 3D body modification artist Steve Haworth is largely credited with popularising sub-dermal implants.

While Haworth only uses Silicone implants, Teflon (PTFE) and biocompatible materials are used for similar effect.

Horn bumps can be inserted subdermally into the forehead.

Implants can be repeatedly removed, with larger ones added when the skin is ready, leaving a more dramatic effect.

However, users face several health risks, including infection, tissue resorption, nerve and muscle pressure, migration, and implant rejection, among others.

Immediately after the horns are implanted into the head, it will feel swollen and sore.

About a week later the person may experience some black eyes and puffy eyelids.

This is due to the body producing excess lymph fluid around the implants, which drains down the face before dispersing throughout the body via the lymphatic system.

It is important that you change your pillowcase every two days to ensure that your head is not resting on a contaminated surface while you sleep.

Until the wounds and stitches heal you may see a small amount of blood on the cloth in the morning.

Although most transdermals appear healed in two to four weeks, the actual internal healing process takes much longer — approximately one year.

They can cost between $500 and $2000 for an inplant depending on the design.
