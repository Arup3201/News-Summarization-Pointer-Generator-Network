Millwall left Ewood Park down, almost out, and in danger of needing snookers to avoid relegation from the Championship.

One source of salvation could yet come in the form of a three-point deduction for Rotherham when a Football League disciplinary commission rules on whether they fielded an ineligible player against Brighton on Easter Monday.

But even that might not be enough. The result leaves Neil Harris’s side four points adrift of fourth-bottom Rotherham with two tough games remaining against promotion-chasing Derby and Wolves. Rotherham have a game in hand and a much better goal difference.

Goals certainly make a difference and, in Rudy Gestede and Jordan Rhodes, Blackburn have two players that Millwall simply do not.

Gestede, scorer of a hat-trick against Nottingham Forest here on Saturday, took his tally for the season to 20 in the 78th minute, despatching a clinical right-foot shot into the top corner after Craig Conway’s cross found its way to him on the edge of the six-yard box.

Rhodes is just behind on 19 goals after coming on as a substitute to make sure of victory, steering his shot past a stranded David Forde in the third minute of added time after the keeper had gone forward in the search for an equaliser.

In contrast, Millwall’s two leading scorers — Ricardo Fuller and Lee Gregory — have just six apiece. The failings in front of goal were all too apparent on Tuesday night.

‘Their two goalscorers have scored more than my whole squad,’ lamented Harris. ‘It’s clear to see why they won 2-0.

‘The team were excellent but we didn’t take our chances. Before tonight we had to win two games to stay in the division. We need six or seven points so my thoughts still haven’t changed.’

Millwall’s best chance fell to substitute Paris Cowan-Hall in the 68th minute. He was clean through on goal after Blackburn were caught out by Alan Dunne’s long ball forward, but goalkeeper Jason Steele rushed off his line to block.

Rovers, who lost captain Matt Kilgallon to injury in the first half and had to play debutant Darragh Lenihan in central defence, had their fair share of chances, but it needed a touch of class to make the difference. Gestede and Rhodes provided it for Blackburn.

Neil Harris' side look almost condemned to relegation from the Championship with two games to still to play

Manager Gary Bowyer is realistic enough to know that they might not both be at Ewood next season. ‘I understand the business we’re in,’ he said.

‘Liverpool sold Luis Suarez and no doubt there will be people leaving bigger clubs than Blackburn Rovers in the summer. But you’ve seen with Jordan and Rudy this season, if the owners’ valuation is not met, then we won’t sell them.’
