A Cold War-era bunker has been put up for auction - complete with instructions on what do in a nuclear fallout.

The underground shelter, which can only be accessed by a ladder, has lain empty for more than two decades in Burton Joyce, Nottinghamshire.

It was manned by volunteers from the Royal Observers Corps (ROC) as the world braced itself for nuclear war at the height of tensions between the West and the Soviet Union in 1961. 

But the well-hidden safety bunker has been empty since the site was shut down in 1991.

A Cold War-era bunker has been put up for auction - complete with instructions on what do in a nuclear fallout. There is only one problem - it can only be accessed via a ladder

The underground chamber is not for the faint-hearted as the estate agent Right Move insists that only 'fit and healthy' customers can descend the vertical ladder to view the property

Lying around four metres below the surface, up to four staff could have squeezed into the subterranean room to monitor the impact of radioactive warfare

It comes with written advice on what to do when the bombs start falling and is expected to fetch around £75,000 when Savills Auctions bring it to market. 

Lying around four metres below the surface, up to four staff could have squeezed into the subterranean room to monitor the impact of radioactive warfare.

The underground centre was fitted with three instruments to measure the direction, strength and radioactive fallout from detonated bombs before feeding back findings to the ROC headquarters in Coventry.

The bunker, which comes bundled with six acres of farmland, is only accessible by a ladder.

But the underground chamber is not for the unfit as the estate agent Right Move insists that only 'fit and healthy' customers can descend the vertical ladder to view the property.

It is one of more than 1,500 monitoring posts made across the country between 1956 and 1965.

 It is thought to have been empty since the site was shut down in 1991. The bunker will be sold at Savills Nottingham on March 26

Martin Dixon, Chairman of underground structure charity Subterranea Britannica, said: 'Many of the posts still survive and a number have been restored by enthusiasts keen to ensure that this chapter in the UK's history is not forgotten.

'Because the Cold War was never fought and had no casualties, it is far less well-known and researched than other 20th century conflicts. Not true. Don't use this sentence.

'The ROC posts were estimated to reduce the impact of radioactive fallout by a factor of over 1,000 but the volunteers who staffed them would have had to leave loved ones behind in the event of war.'

Auctioneer Richard Gadd, of Savills Nottingham, said: 'Built for purpose, the bunker provides the chance to purchase a piece of well preserved history as well as a parcel of arable land.

'There is the potential to recreate what would have been here back in 1961 in addition to numerous other opportunities.'

The bunker will be sold at Savills Nottingham on March 26.
