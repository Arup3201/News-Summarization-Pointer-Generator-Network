As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

MAURICIO ISLA IN A NUTSHELL

Isla arrives at QPR with plenty of experience from Serie A. The 26-year-old made over 150 appearances in Italy's top division with Udinese and current parent club Juventus - and that should stand him in fine stead to show his ability as a Premier League wing back.

Harry Redknapp will deploy the Chilean on the right of his midfield in his favoured 3-5-2 formation, although Isla's versatility means he could be pushed further up or into a back four should Redknapp want to mix thing up.

Isla boasts pace down the flank with the ability to whip the ball into the box and he should be a perfect fit at Loftus Road.

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE ISLA IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM

Wing backs look to be a popular option with a lot of Premier League sides this year - and that offers the perfect option for Fantasy Football managers looking for more points from their defenders.

Playing out at right wing back should give Isla the chance to run up and down that wing and with his crossing ability he will weigh in with a good few assists especially with a poacher like Charlie Austin to aim for.

And at just £4.1million - why not go for him? That's £0.6m cheaper than Liverpool's hapless centre back Kolo Toure!

TOP LEVEL EXPERIENCE

Isla was one of Chile's many stars that impressed with their brilliant team play at this summer's World Cup. They were unlucky to be beaten on penalties by hosts Brazil and Isla looked pretty good - making his loan signing a bit of a coup for QPR.

There's not just that though - Isla has played in the Champions League with Juventus too, so he should have no trouble adapting to the testing conditions of the Premier League.

BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS?  

Attacking runs up the flank should provide a fair share of assists for a defender - while Isla should be an almost certain starter for the Rs, meaning plenty of appearance points.

You wouldn't expect someone from a newly promoted side to pick up much in terms of clean sheets but that might be a bit different for QPR.

Harry Redknapp knows the league well and with experienced defenders like Rio Ferdinand and the quality of Steven Caulker helping out in defence, there's still potential for bonuses for Fantasy Football managers.

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Harry Redknapp knows a thing or two about what makes a good Premier League player - and he seems excited to see Isla in action for his newly promoted side.

'He's a top player and we're delighted to have him here,' Redknapp said. 'He showed his quality in the World Cup for Chile and it's a great loan signing for us.'

'He’s a versatile player, he’s full of energy. I’m confident he’ll be a really big asset for us this season.'

Redknapp's words seem to indicate that he would even be happy playing Isla further up the field should the Rs change formation - great news for Fantasy Football managers looking to get more out of their defenders. 

Energetic: Isla will be up and down the flank for QPR this season - let's hope for big points from him!
