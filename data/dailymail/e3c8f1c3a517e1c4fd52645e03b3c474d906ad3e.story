Tracks on the £50billion HS2 railway line should be laid in the north at the same time as the south, the project's chief has said.

Construction work will begin on the link between London Euston and the West Midlands in 2017.

But Sir David Higgins, the former chief executive of Network Rail, believes routes to and from northern cities such as Leeds and Manchester should be developed simultaneously.

Development: Work on the HS2 will begin in London in 2017. But politicians and rail chiefs believe routes from northern cities such as Leeds and Manchester should be established at the same time

Mick Whelan, the General Secretary of the train driver union, told the Sunday People: 'Let's get as much of this built as possible and create a great railway.

'We believe HS2 should benefit the whole country.'

Sir David will suggest bringing the project forward in the belief that a faster construction period will improve the controversial scheme's popularity.

During the announcement of a report documenting the high-speed link's progress tomorrow, he will also issue an appeal to the main political parties to unite behind the scheme.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has backed the accelerated timetable, saying there is a 'compelling case' to speed up the extension.

Budget: At present the cost of HS2 is put at £42.6 billion, with a further £7.5 billion needed for the trains

Mr Cable made clear his support for the scheme, arguing that bringing forward the northern link could help rebalance the British economy.

'Creating jobs outside London, and closing the gap between north and south, has been one of this Government's top priorities,' he said.

'On every visit I make to the north of England, I've heard businesses and council leaders make a compelling case for getting to the north more quickly by accelerating parts of the HS2 build.

'That would ensure the economic benefits can be shared sooner by everyone around the country and deserves serious consideration by government.'

The controversial system, which has sparked protests in towns such as Wendover, Buckinghmashire, would see trains running between London and Birmingham by 2026

In contrast, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said last week that it was important that Sir David could show that costs 'have come down markedly'.

Mr Balls suggested if the costs were shown to have decreased and come under control then Labour would back HS2 when it receives its second reading in the House of Commons in the coming weeks.

He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'At every stage in this project for the next few years, because it's going to go into the next parliament when the final decision is taken, I'm going to say there's no blank cheque, the costs have got to come down, the assumptions have to be robust.

'If this is not a value for money project, it shouldn't be supported. I want to make sure the costs come down. We've not seen the report yet.

'We'll support this because I think investment in new capacity is needed north and south, and to be honest have a bigger debate about what's needed in the north and the current plans.

'We'll support it at second reading but we will continue to be vigilant, get the costs down, there's no blank cheque from the Labour government on this project.'

At present the cost of HS2 is put at £42.6 billion, with a further £7.5 billion needed for the high-speed trains.

The scheme's first phase will see a new line run from London through Tory heartlands to Birmingham and is scheduled to be completed in 2026.

The second phase, taking the line in a Y-shape to north-west and north-east England, is set for completion around 2032/33.

Launching his report in Manchester, Sir David will say that he would like work to start on the second phase at the same time as the first phase.

He is also expected to recommend a completely new station at Euston, the site for the line's London terminus.

Sir David, who has joined HS2 Ltd after being Network Rail chief executive, is also expected to recommend scrapping plans to link HS2 with HS1, the London to Kent coast Channel Tunnel high-speed line.

HS2 is facing a number of obstacles over and above strong opposition by residents who face years of disruption while the building work goes on.

Mr Balls is not the only Labour politician to express reservations about the scheme. Former chancellor Alistair Darling and former industry secretary Lord Mandelson have also questioned the project's viability.

In addition, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said that the legislation for phase one of the project will not get through Parliament before next year's general election.

The route to cities including Newcastle, Edinburgh, Leeds and Glasgow is not set to be running until at least 2032. The initial route between London Euston and Birmingham is set to be operational in 2026
