Peter Wright is still a fighting chance to make the Premier League darts play-offs after a thrilling 6-6 draw with six-time champion Phil Taylor in Newcastle on Thursday night.

Taylor blew chances to claim the tie in which a win would have confirmed his semi-final spot, but Wright battled to a deadlock to set up a rivetting scenario for next week final round in Brighton.

Wright broke Taylor's throw first up but Taylor raced to an earlyÂ  3-1 lead when 'Snakebite' missed three darts at a double to tie things up.

The man with the wild hair responded though to draw level at 3-3 and then won a third in a row when an out-of-character Taylor failed to finish.

Taylor then showed just why he has 16 world championships to his names after levelling and then delivering an 11-darter to go up 5-4.

Wright wouldn't go away though with both players exchanging points to finish with honours even.

There was no absence of drama though, with Taylor seeming unimpressed when Wright played up to the crowd before his failure to knock off 62 with his three darts to finish off the match.

'I was gutted, I had my chances and I missed a lot of doubles there, but I'm happy to still be in there,' Taylor told Sky Sports.

Straight shooter: Michael van Gerwen won convincing in his win over fellow Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld

Earlier in the evening Gary Anderson accounted for Dave Chisnall 7-4 to go equal with Taylor on the table and one point ahead of Wright.

Wright now has to beat rival Michael van Gerwen in Brighton and rely on other results to make the play-offs.

In the final match of the night it was an all-Dutch affair as Van Gerwen beat Raymond van Barneveld 7-4, coming back from an early 3-1 deficit.

Van Gerwen wrapped up the match and went two points clear of his countryman with a 132 checkout.

After a run eight consecutive defeats former world champion Adrian Lewis stopped the rot with a 7-5 win over Robert Thornton in the night's other match.
