It was far from a traditional wedding ceremony when Helen Morfitt and Felix Laws tied the knot.

Mainly because the groom used to be a woman and the bride used to be a man.

And when the pair said 'I do' last Friday, they became the first couple to have a sex swap marriage in Britain.

Sex swap marriage: Felix Laws and Helen Morfitt became Mr and Mrs Fenlon after tying the knot in Gretna Green

Happily married: The pair invited 13 people who had given them the most support to the ceremony

Both Helen and Felix have gone through 
sex change procedures and became Britain's first double sex swap married
couple when they tied the knot on Gretna Green, Scotland.

They both had their reassignment operations on September 13 - Helen in 2003 and Felix in 2010 - so thought it would be fitting as the date for their wedding.

The couple, who have been together for six years. were forced to change gender on their birth certificates before they could elope.

Before: Felix, who was a woman called Katy and was pregnant at the time of this photo (left) while Helen's old passport photo shows the facial hair she had when she was a man called Leslie (right)

Helen, 56, who was a man known as 
Leslie, and teaching assistant Felix, 46, once Katy, have suffered four 
broken marriages between them and have 10 children.

But after years of suffering Helen told the Sunday Mirror the wedding was perfect and the dress had been something she dreamt about as a little girl.

She said: 'I had butterflies during the service and I thought my knees would buckle under me.'

And Felix, 46, who wore a kilt, admitted he was almost knocked off his feet when he saw the bride approaching the altar. 

'I will love Helen forever. When I saw her coming down the aisle, I just thought 'Wow'. She looked incredible.'

The pair met in 2008 after Felix confessed to his doctor that he was trapped in the wrong body.

From the age of eight, he knew he wanted to become a man. As Katy, he got married at 22 and had two sons - but walked out after 13 years leaving his children behind.

When he left his husband, he strapped down his 38F breasts so he could feel better about himself.

Felix's GP then sent him to a psychologist after hearing his story, who then put him in touch with transgender support group run by Helen.

A support worker at Lincoln University, Helen was born a man called Leslie Morfitt. She got married three times and fathered eight children

While she was growing up, she had always wanted to be a girl, but her father's position in the military made it tough for her to change gender.

Despite trying to suppress the urges, she cross-dressed in secret and, in the end, she opted for gender-reassignment treatment after the stress became too overwhelming.

Helen's son Darren walked her down the aisle while Felix shook with nerves as he placed the ring on her finger.

The couple, from Hull, chose just 13 people who have given them the most support to attend the ceremony. Close friends Natalie Wellings, 25, and Anna Dinsdale, 49, were chosen as bridesmaids while Matthew Lewis, 40, was best man.

Helen and Felix say the most difficult part of their transitions was telling their children.

Helen, told her two youngest children when they were only five and six years old, explaining that she was ill and could only get better if she became a woman.

She said: 'The six-year-old was super cute and asked me if she could start calling me Helen instead of daddy.'

Her other two girls and four boys have slowly come around to the idea of the wedding.

Felix became estranged from one of his sons after the sex change, but his other son Kieran, 20, was there to watch him tie the knot.
