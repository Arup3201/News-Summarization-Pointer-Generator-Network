A Michelin-starred restaurant in London has become the first in the country where customers will have to pay before they eat.

The Clove Club in Shoreditch is implementing a ticketing system in June to reduce the number of cancellations it has to deal with.

The system Tock was originally developed by Chicago restaurateur Nick Kokonas who owns Alinea, which frequently appears in the world's best restaurants list.

The Clove Club's Head chef Isaac McHale says the cost of cancellations can be damaging for businesses. 

'It's going to ruffle a few feathers,' he said in an interview with Bloomberg.

'But everyone has a problem with no shows and short-seated tables. 

'The more ambitious your restaurant, the more money you spend on ingredients and staff, and you want to keep prices down. We tend to have very high break-evens.'

According to the Bloomberg, from June onwards diners will be offered a choice of two tasting menus costing either £65 or £95.

The entire cost of the meal must be paid for in advance - although drinks and extra items can be settled on the day.

The system works very much along the lines of sport, theatre or gig bookings, and will see diners forfeit the price of their meals if they don't show up.

'By the time someone walks into our restaurant we have already spent a lot of money on ingredients and on getting the right amount of staff, so if they cancel it is very expensive for us,' Mr McHale said to The Telegraph.

'Diners used to lose deposits if they didn't show up but we want to give people good hospitality and it offends guests when they have to give their credit card details before they arrive.'

On its website, The Clove Club says: 'The Clove Club is a restaurant in Shoreditch Town Hall in East London. 

'Built in 1865, the Town Hall was for over 100 years one of the grandest vestry halls in the city. Having ceased to be a home for local government during the 1960s it is now a popular arts and events space, run by Shoreditch Town Hall Trust. 

'At The Clove Club we serve an ambitious five course menu and an extended menu, featuring interesting and often overlooked British ingredients and produce.

'In our front room we also have a bar which guests are welcome to drop in for a drink and a snack.'
