The unfortunate owner of this ruined car will think twice before blocking in another driver in future.

Not content with taking a baseball bat to the window, releasing the handbrake and rolling the car out of his way, the obstructed driver then summoned a cement truck to fill the offending vehicle with wet concrete.

Stunned onlookers can be heard laughing in disbelief on video footage of the scene in Russia, which shows the interior of the car being flooded with concrete while the man looks on in satisfaction.

Scroll down for video

Temper: The irate driver was filmed taking a baseball bat to the window of the car in Russia, then summoning a cement truck to fill up the offending vehicle with concrete

Concrete revenge: Onlookers can be heard laughing in disbelief on the video as the car is flooded with cement

Messy motor: The entire interior of the car was filled with a pool of wet concrete

It is not clear whether the incident captured in the clip, which was posted on the liveleak.com website, was a prank or a genuine act of revenge.

Upon finding the blue car blocking his expensive white vehicle, the man uses a baseball bat to smash its window, reach in and release the handbrake.

After rolling the car out of his way, the man can be seen making a call on his mobile phone, after which a cement truck comes rumbling around the corner.

The truck pulls up alongside the blue car and begins pumping concrete through the window, until its interior resembles a murky brown swimming pool.

Finally satisfied, the blocked in driver can then be seen driving off in his white car without a backwards glance.Â 

Impatient: The man took matters into his own hands when he returned to his parked car only to find it was blocked in by another vehicle

Obstacle: The man reached into the car, released the handbrake and rolled it out of his way

Payback: Not content with simply moving the car out of his way, the man decided to call for back up

Uh oh: A short while later, the footage shows a cement truck come rumbling around the corner

Flooded: The cement truck pulled up alongside the car and began pouring wet concrete through the window

Sticky end: The moment the unfortunate owner of the car returned to his vehicle was not captured on camera

Ruined: The interior of the car was swamped with wet cement up to the window sills

Retaliation: This man did not take it lightly when he found his car blocked in by another driver

Without a backwards glance: Apparently satisfied at last, the man can be seen driving away in his car, which appeared to be a white Bentley
