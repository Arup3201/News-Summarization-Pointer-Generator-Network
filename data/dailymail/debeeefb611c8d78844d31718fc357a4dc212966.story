Five-year-old brain cancer patient Ashya King has been filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted online by his brother today.

The little boy can be seen smiling as he is gently lifted out of his pushchair in the Prague playground by his older brother Naveed, who then sits with him on a rocking toy while carefully supporting his head.

The footage, uploaded by Naveed, 20, then shows him playing with a giggling Ashya on a toy digger - much to the little boy's delight. 

It is apparently the first time that the seriously ill boy has been able to go to the park with his family since he started being treated in the Czech Republic.

It comes after he was pictured at a pizza restaurant clutching a favourite toy and looking healthier than he has done for weeks in an image also shared by his older brother.

Ashya's parents, Brett and Naghmeh King, sparked an international police hunt when they removed their son from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without medical consent.

They took him to Prague to receive proton beam therapy which was not available for him on the NHS.

The video blog footage shows the family taking Ashya outside and to a children's park on a sunny day.

When the footage of the family in the park comes to an end, Naveed says to the camera: 'So that's kind of been like the first time in ages that Ashya's been able to go to the park.

He then sits with him on a rocking toy. It is the first time in two months the little boy has gone to the park

'It's been about two months maybe since he's been at the park. That's pretty much since he's had his operation. So, two months for such a young boy is such a long time.'

He added: 'He had such a great time. It's amazing.'

Naveed described the outing as 'a huge thing'.

He said: 'We haven't actually taken him out since we've been here. I really wanted to make sure he had a nice time... I'm really happy that he was happy.'

The footage was posted online today but it is not clear when exactly the footage was filmed, although at the beginning of the film Naveed says it is Sunday.

Two days ago, Naveed posted a photograph of himself and Ashya on Instagram, saying: 'Ashya found 2 people today in prague wishing him well, people who he had never meet before, but they knew all about him!'

Once it was discovered the Kings had fled with Ashya in August, an international arrest warrant was issued and the parents faced a protracted legal battle to get him to the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC), with a High Court judge only approving the move after they had been released from police custody in Spain.

The PTC has said proton therapy is more effective than radiotherapy as it limits the collateral damage of radiation to other vital organs, such as the heart and liver in Ashya's case. This would lead to less severe long-term side-effects including heart and breathing problems.

The NHS has since agreed to fund Ashya's treatment.

Jana Kulhankova, of the Proton Therapy Centre of Prague, said the boy had been moved into his own private room following his last round of proton beam therapy.

'Ashya left the intensive care unit on Tuesday and has been put in an individual room,' she said.

He has 'started to put on weight, he is smiling, and he is reacting to the gestures of his parents and those close to him,' she added.

His father, Brett King, said the family are now considering the next step of his treatment which could see them head to Spain.

He said: 'Now Ashya has started his proton beam therapy, we need to be thinking about what comes next.

'He still cannot move on his own and he can't talk properly either so we need to think about physiotherapy and occupational therapy for him.

'We have got a doctor who works in Madrid coming to see us soon so he can assess Ashya and his condition. But he will definitely need ongoing treatment in a hospital so we won't be coming home for a while.' 

He added that Ashya still needs to be fed through a tube and they are still working out the best way to get him to the hospital in Spain.

'Once we meet the doctor, we will have a better idea of what lies ahead,' he said.
