President Obama's much-talked-about tan suit was the first order of business on Friday when White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest revealed the president 'feels pretty good' about the choice.

Rather than address  matters such as the crises in Syria and Iraq, Earnest started Friday's media briefing with comments about the tan suit, which Obama wore on Thursday.

'The president stands squarely behind the decision that he made yesterday to wear his summer suit at yesterday's news conference,' Josh Earnest said. 'It's the Thursday before Labor Day.' 

When asked why he wasn't wearing a summer suit himself, Earnest joked that he had 'contemplated it' but it 'seemed like it might be a little too much,' he said.

The president's questionable fashion choice had set Twitter abuzz with memes and jokes at the president's expense after his appearance on Thursday. 

As well as inspiring jokes, it also incited anger from New York Rep. Peter King, who lambasted the president's decision to wear the suit when he had serious matters to discuss.

'There’s no way any of us can excuse what the president did yesterday,' he said on NewsMaxTV.

Should President Obama have worn a taupe suit to talk about ISIS?

He explained that it was not appropriate for the president to wear a 'light tan suit' or talk about the economy when Americans really wanted to know about his strategy for ISIS.

'For him to walk out — I’m not trying to be trivial here — in a light suit, light tan suit, saying that first he wants to talk about... the revision of second quarter numbers on the economy.

'This is a week after Jim Foley was beheaded and he's trying to act like real Americans care about the economy, not about ISIS and not about terrorism. Then he goes on to say he has no strategy.'

Online, some users praised the fashion-forward leader of the free world for his bold selection, while others suggested that the taupe two-piece number, paired with a crisp white shirt and a striped grey tie, was not an appropriate ensemble for the occasion.

Before long, three new accounts popped up on Twitter dedicated to Mr Obama’s khaki getup.

Members of the media on the left and the right rushed to put in their two cents about the show-stealing tan suit.

Online zingers: Commentators took to Twitter to poke fun at Mr Obama's unorthodox sartorial choice 

Dog days of summer: Twitter users joked that the president wanted to don the light-colored suit before Labor Day, which marks the cutoff point for wearing summery hues

Imaginary conversation: User Eric Schroeck even wrote a dialogue between Obama and Joe Biden about the infamous suit 

Weighing in: Twitter users wondered what Hilary Clinton might make of the whole debacle

That didn't take long: At least three Twitter accounts have been created in honor of Obama's tan suit 

Josh Barro, with the New York Times, quipped: 'Obama vows to defeat whoever made him wear this suit.'

Philip Klein, of Washington Examiner, jokingly remarked: 'this is what happens when Obama bypasses Congress to purchase a suit.' 

Meanwhile, conservative pundit Michelle Malkin did not miss a chance to take a potshot at the president, tweeting: 'I don't care that Obama's suit is tan. The problem with the suit that it's EMPTY.'

It's been pointed out on Twitter that Mr Obama decided to break out the controversial outfit just days before Labor Day - the traditional cut-off point for wearing white and other light hues.

One Twitter user suggested that the poor wardrobe choice was one of Obama's better decisions

Journalist Matt Viser, who covers the White House for The Boston Globe, revealed on Twitter that Obama has worn a tan suite on Easter Sunday this year.

Some people have unfavorably compared the khaki-clad president to a church deacon, an insurance salesmen and a real estate agent.

User Scott Lofquist went so far as to Photoshop the logo of the real estate company Century 21 onto the president's jacket.

But Rep John Dingell, the 88-year-old Democratic congressman from Colorado who himself is no stranger to light-colored formal wear, came to the president's defense.

'I see no problem with the suit,' he tweeted.

The great Twitter freakout over Obama’s suit was marked by amusing and mildly clever puns, among them ‘yes, we tan’ and ‘the audacity of taupe’ - a play on the title of the president’s bestseller The Audacity of Hope.

Unlucky: Within minutes, Twitter was abuzz with thousands of comments about Obama's choice

Skewed priorities: Some Twitter commenters fumed that the public should be paying attention to the president's words rather than to his clothes 

When he is not playing golf on Martha's Vineyard or vacationing in Hawaii, Mr Obama has been known to wear dark, sober colors to press conferences and town hall meetings.

Speaking to Vanity Fair in 2012, the president addressed his approach to sartorial choices.

‘You'll see I wear only grey or blue suits,’ Obama told the magazine. ‘I'm trying to pare down decisions. I don't want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.’

The outpouring of snide comments about the beige ensemble donned by the president for the press conference provoked anger in some quarters, with commenters like NBC News’ Louis Dubois fuming that constituents should be paying attention to what Obama says rather than to the color of his suit.

‘Obama is talking about ISIS, Ukraine, immigration and more here. You know, "news." Yet people are talking about a tan suit,’ he wrote.
