David Hockney, known as one of the most versatile artists of the 20th century, has embraced tablet technology for his latest exhibition.

The 76-year-old has always been interested in experimenting with new techniques, but the launch of the iPhone and iPad has taken his work to a new level.

A San Francisco gallery is exhibiting work Hockney has created on the devices in the past ten years as he shows how technology has influenced artists for centuries.

The most up-to-date work on show at de Young Museum is a series of 12ft prints, entitled Bigger Yosemite, which Hockney created on an iPad.

His experimentation with the smart technology began with the iPhone, which allowed him to make sketches with his thumbs, but the release of the iPad expanded his possibilities.

'I
 do think it is a new medium. I found it more interesting than Photoshop
 because you can pick up a color from another color. And you can work 
very fast. And that's something every draftsman is interested in,' 
Hockney told the Los Angeles Times.

The
 iPad's mobility also appealed. It fitted comfortably in the pockets he 
has sewn into his jackets for his sketchbooks, and it meant he no longer needed to carry around paints and pencils.

The speed of the creative process has made the last year one of the most prolific in the artist's long career.

'His
 use of the iPad has gone way beyond sketching on the screen to become a
 core part of his creative process,' according to the audio tour that 
accompanies the exhibition.

The British artist, who has a studio in California, has always been intrigued by new media. When photocopiers were first released Canon used to send him ink cartridges to experiment with.

At the end of the 90s Hockney began to research how old masters had used optical devices to improve their technique and perspective, CNN reported.

He discovered that 19th century artists had used technology such as the camera lucida - a small prism on a metal arm that let them refract an image on to canvas.

Hockney's research, and subsequent book - Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters - has resulted in the latest exhibition which includes work created on iPads and video cameras, as well as more traditional methods.

'Like an artist alchemist, in one minute Hockney uses a fancy digital device to make a colorful iPad drawing; in the next he shows us that he is one of our greatest draftsmen by rendering an exactingly detailed charcoal drawing of a forest scene in East Yorkshire,' Richard Benefield, of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, said.

Part of the exhibition charts the history of art in a huge piece entitled The Great Wall. The 8ft by 72ft work is a chronological history of how optical aids have influenced western art.

Included among the sketches and paintings, on show until January 20, are four sets of screens showing footage of the same country road in the changing seasons.

Hockney created it by mounting video cameras on a vehicle, which he controlled as a studio assistant drove along the road.

'Itâ€™s clear from the pace at
 which Hockney continues to produce such important work - and the fearless
 nature of his innovation - that he has conceded nothing to his 76 years,' Mr Benefield said.
