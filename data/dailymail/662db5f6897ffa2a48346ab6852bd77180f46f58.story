Nicola Payne, who disappeared aged 18 while walking home from her boyfriend's house in 1991

Police investigating the disappearance of teenager Nicola Payne in Coventry 21 years ago said today they have arrested two men aged 74 and 45 on suspicion of conspiracy to prevent the lawful and decent burial of a body.

Officers yesterday launched a major search for the body of a teenage mother who went missing more than two decades ago after a tip-off that she could be buried in scrub land.

Detectives hunting for Nicola Payne - who vanished on a five-minute walk home from a boyfriend's house - are using X-ray ground scanners and dogs trained to sniff out bodies as they scour the site in her hometown of Coventry.

The mother-of-one was just 18 when she went missing after cutting across foggy waste land in the suburb of Courthouse Green on December 14, 1991.

She lived with her parents and her seven-month-old son Owen - who never got to know his mother.

Miss Payne's relatives spoke of 'fresh hope' that they may finally be able to lay her to rest after years of misery.

The dig is taking place just a few hundred metres away from where she was last seen 21 years ago.

Home Office forensic scientists will be joined by experts using X-ray equipment and cadaver dogs during the search, which is expected to last several days.

DCI Matt Markham, of West Midlands Police CID, said: 'This activity is as a direct result of new information which has been developed by detectives working on the case.

'The investigation into Nicola's disappearance has always remained open and any new information has been examined.

'We are today continuing to appeal for new information and would urge the local community to think back as to whether they saw anything suspicious on or around the 14 December 1991, either at this location or where Nicola was last sighted, to come forward if they have not previously done so.'

Since Miss Payne's disappearance her family have campaigned tirelessly to find out what happened.

Speaking from her parent's home, Miss Payne's brother said the family had gathered together to support each other while the hunt for her body resumed.

Nigel Payne, 48, said: 'We've been here once or twice before, hopefully this will put an end to it.

'We've all come together, what my mum
 and dad are going through is difficult enough at the best of times but 
when these things come up it really, really affects them.

'If nothing comes of it, it's an awfully long time to try and pick them back up again.

'You just wish that "this is it" and 
we can have a bit of closure, that's all we need at the moment, then my 
mum and dad can go and put my sister to rest.

'It's hard enough being her brother but what my mum and dad are going through, that's something different.'

He added that police had only revealed minimal details of the search to the family, who were today nervously awaiting news.

He said: 'They've said there's new information and they wanted to go searching this area and that's all they've told us.

'We'd love to know a bit more but we're just sitting here.

'It's frustrating - it's a waiting game.'

Today forensic tents were erected and specialist teams with police dogs could be seen searching the area.

Officers equipped with 
state-of-the-art ground scanning equipment could be seen scouring the 
area and a loud drilling could be heard.

Family friend David Williams, 76, who lives opposite the park land, said: 'I remember the night that it happened well. 

'It was ever so misty. You could not see a thing. It was real thick fog so nobody would have seen anything untoward.

'She went walking across the path and never made it. 

'Half an hour later her dad went out looking for her and phoned the police.

'The family have never given up looking for her but they do think she is dead.

'It is the biggest mystery in Coventry. It has never gone away.'

DCI Markham added: 'We are extremely 
hopeful that we will find something. We owe it to the family to try get 
them a bit of closure to this 20 year mystery.

'Nicola's family have suffered 
tremendously over the last 20 years. Nicola would have been 40 this 
January so it is a real key milestone for them.

'It is very much the view of the 
investigation team that someone out there does know what happened to 
Nicola and holds the key to unraveling the mystery of the disappearance.

'We are clearing overgrowth and 
making the area suitable for more scientific investigation to try an 
establish further areas of interest.

'It is a direct result of new 
information coming to light which we assessed and deemed worthy of 
further investigation, which might offer up new clues in terms of what 
happened to Nicola Payne all those years ago.'

Miss Payne was 5ft 3in tall, of medium build, with brown hair and brown eyes.

She was last seen wearing a brown leather jacket, purple T-shirt and fawn trousers.

The investigation into her 
disappearance was never closed and in the last 20 years a number of 
Coventry locations have been dug up in the hunt for her.

In November 2007 a 37-year-old from 
Derbyshire was arrested but, after spending five months on bail, he was 
released without charge.

DCI Markham added: 'We are committed to investigating any new information with the aim of bringing closure to Nicola’s family, who have endured a painful and traumatic 21 years since her disappearance.'

In 2007, Miss Payne's son Owen - who is now 21 - described how he had missed out on memories with his mother.

He said: 'I was seven months old when my lovely mum Nickie went missing.

'Nan and granddad always say that she had a loving bond with me, which was noticeable to all.

'Sadly I have no memories of her and I
 envy my older cousins who remember her well, and they tell me what a 
fun-loving girl she was.

'During my early years at school I 
wished that my mum could meet me at the school gates after school to 
collect me, as other mums did with my friends.

'School plays, sports days and open days - there was no mum there to spoil me.

'My dad and all the family were always loving and caring, but it wasn't the same.

'My
 one wish would be to have my mum found and to be able to understand the
 confusion, mystery and heartbreak of the past 16 years.'

Her mother Marilyn, along with father John, has fought since her disappearance to find out her daughter's fate.

She said the family had given up hope that Miss Payne was still alive, but hoped one day her body would be found.

Marilyn
 said: 'John, myself and all the family do not believe Nickie is still 
alive, but we will never give up hope that one day our daughter will be 
found and we will have some kind of closure.

'On Saturday, December 14, 1991, our lives were shattered and since then life has never been the same.

'We all support each other on our bad days of which there are many, as we are still a very close-knit family.

'In the beginning, the police responded immediately and they have kept in touch and supported us over the years.

'There have been numerous enquiries 
all over the country, but we are still in the dark wanting answers as to
 the whereabouts of our only daughter Nicola.'

The
 missing woman's family said in a statement: 'It has been nearly 21 
years since our daughter Nicola went missing. For many years we have 
suffered not knowing what has happened to her.

'This demonstrates that there are people still providing vital and important information to the price around her disappearance.

'If
 there is anyone who has information that will assist the police around 
this new site or witnessed anything around this location back in 
December 1991 please make contact with the officers.

'We are appealing as a family to find Nicola and to give us the clue we deserve.'
