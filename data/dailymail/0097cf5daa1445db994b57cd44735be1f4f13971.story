A talented musical star who shot to fame on the BBC talent show Any Dream Will Do has been sacked from his role as Prince Charming after it was revealed that he starred in a porn film.

Craig Chalmers, 30, made his name after appearing in the hit BBC show Any Dream Will Do which searched for a new lead to star in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat.

He has since established himself as a talented performer and was due to play Prince Charming in Cinderella at the Alhambra Theatre in Dunfermline, Scotland.

Technicolour Dreamcoat

But the star, from Edinburgh, was axed after bosses were tipped off that he had starred in X-rated movies.

In the married actor’s adult film, in 
which he used the name Ryan Ryder, he can clearly be seen taking part in
sex acts and his profile and photograph are also included on an adult 
talent agency website.

It is not clear when the film was made but the shocking revelation prompted theatre chiefs to axe Chalmers who has now been replaced with his co-star James Mackenzie.

A spokesperson from the Alhambra Theatre said that the content was not appropriate for someone appearing in a family show and that Chalmers had admitted his involvement.

She said: 'In light of information given by an anonymous member of the public, of which we were completely unaware, we can confirm that Craig Chalmers is no longer taking part in our pantomime Cinderella.

'We are extremely disappointed that 
Craig Chalmers did not see fit to make us aware of his involvement in 
the adult entertainment business.

'If we had been made aware Craig would never have been cast in our panto.

'The Alhambra panto is all about fun for all the family and it would be entirely inappropriate for him to take part.

'The role of Prince Charming will now be played by CBBC’s Raven star James Mackenzie.'

Chalmers has previously performed with an all-male strip group called G-Force and had a short-lived career in boyband No Reason.

But he became a household name in 
2007 when he finished fifth in Saturday night show Any Dream Will Do and
was later chosen to play Joseph in the UK touring production 
establishing him as a musical star.

The BBC declined to comment on the revelations.

The decision to sack Chalmers from the panto, which opens on December 18, was praised by Dunfermline councillor Helen Law

Chalmers
also starred as Aladdin at last year’s panto at the Alhambra Theatre 
and appeared in a stage show called dirty dating.com last month.

The
actor’s profile picture as Ryan Ryder can be seen on the JEM talent 
website, but the agency were unavailable to comment yesterday.

The
profile reads: 'Ryan Ryder is the new man on the block to the industry 
(sic) and with the combination of his large equipment, good looks, and 
assured performance in front of camera, he is already in demand.

'Ryan’s
friendly and laid back nature along with his dependability and work 
ethic means he is a fantastic asset and our very first exclusive male 
performer.

'Ryan is available for both recorded shoots and live shows.'

One of Chalmers’ porn appearances was uploaded to a porn website as recently as August this year.

The decision to sack Chalmers from the panto, which opens on December 18, was praised by Dunfermline councillor Helen Law.

She said: 'I think they have taken the right action and congratulate them for being so prompt about it.

'In light of recent publicity, I think that people are very aware of not having their stars, local or otherwise, involved in such things. I hope the show is still a success.'

Craig Chalmers was unavailable for comment through his agent and his website was offline.
