A Florida teenager 
accused of beating his parents with a hammer before hosting a party 
at their home believes he has 'such a strong defense' that he will reach
 a plea deal with prosecutors to avoid a life sentence.

Tyler
 Hadley, 18, awaits trial on charges of first-degree murder in the 
deaths last July 16 of Blake and Mary-Jo Hadley. He has pleaded not 
guilty.

In jailhouse letters released by prosecutors, he hopes he can 
avoid prison altogether and be placed in a state hospital.

'I'll get out,' he wrote to a friend.

Hadley repeatedly complains of 
depression in his letters to friends and family. In a letter to his 
maternal grandparents last November, he wrote that he cries every day, 
prays for forgiveness and feels bad about how his brother has been 
affected by the killings..

'I know he misses our parents and I 
really miss them too,' he wrote. 'I feel remorse and guilt every day for
 what happened. I just hope the Hadleys and the rest of our family know 
the reason why everything happened. I don't want people to think of me 
as a psycho.'

Hadley doesn't refer to that reason 
in the letters, but scattered throughout the letters and police 
documents are possible factors that could be discussed at trial in an 
attempt to prove insanity.

It was revealed in may that Hadley signs
 jailhouse autographs exclaiming 'It's hammer time,' calls himself 
'hammer boy,' and says he has seen and talked to the devil, a fellow 
inmate told police.

bedroom where they had been lying as their son held a rowdy party

The inmate, Justin Toney, described 
Hadley's jailhouse fame in interviews outlined in investigative files 
released by prosecutors.

Hadley
 has pleaded not guilty in the bludgeonings last July of Blake and 
Mary-Jo Hadley. Toney told investigators that Hadley is known as 'Hambo'
 and 'Bamm-Bamm' by other inmates and that he has given autographs, 
including some on news articles about his case.

Every time a new inmate is admitted, Toney said in the February 21 interview, Hadley makes an introduction.

'What's up man?' Toney quoted Hadley as saying. 'You know who I am? I'm the hammer boy.'

The
 inmate says Hadley has given differing accounts of why he allegedly 
committed the crimes. First, he said, Hadley blamed it on medication he 
was on. Later, though, he said Hadley explained it was because he wanted
 to have a party and knew his parents would not let him.

'All this to have a party?' Detective Kristin Meyer of the Port St. Lucie Police asked. 'That's what he said,' Toney replied.

Family: Hadley's mother Mary-Jo and father Blake were found beaten to death with a hammer, which was lying between their bodies

Toney said Hadley told him he had been contemplating the killings for about three weeks and had considered using a garden tool instead.

'He said he seen the devil,' Toney said. 'He said he talked to the devil and the devil talked to him.'

Still, there are glimpses of a different Hadley in the files. Toney said Hadley would sometimes bring him a ramen noodle cup, and often expressed remorse for his alleged crimes. In a log of a jailhouse visit with his older brother, Ryan, Hadley tells his brother he loves him and tells him to tell others he says hello and loves them too.

Kelly Reynolds, who was interviewed by police but whose relationship to Hadley was not made clear, said he was an altar boy.

Hadley's public defender, Mark Harllee, did not return a call on Friday seeking comment.

Hadley told a friend interviewed by police, Daniel Roberts, that his father had punched him in the face several times and had shown signs of injuries at times, according to the files. But Toney said Hadley told him he'd never been beaten or molested, and Ryan Hadley called his parents 'awesome' and his brother a 'pathological liar'.

Murder weapon: Police believe Hadley battered his parents to death with this hammer

Police have said about 60 people, invited via Facebook, gathered for a party at Hadley's house after his parents were killed, playing beer pong, smoking cigars and drinking.

Friends described Hadley as being in a good mood and hospitable as the bloody bodies of his parents was strewn across the floor of their bedroom.

Toney said Hadley claimed to have spent $2,000 on drugs and alcohol for the party, describing it as 'so much fun'.

He said Hadley knew he had 'shocked the world' and realised something about his parents as he allegedly attacked them with a hammer.

'I said, "Did they try to stop you?"' Toney asked about the attack. 'And he was like, "No, that's how I knew that they really loved me."'
