Maureen Lambert had a dream. Standing on the touchline at Liverpool’s academy in the 1990s, watching her determined son Rickie begin his career, she knew one day his rewards would come.

‘I always said he was going to the Premier League,’ Maureen recalled. ‘When we were at Liverpool and I was with the mums, I used to say, “I will be in my 50s before he becomes famous”. I just knew from when he was little. He was lovely growing up, always playing football.’

Rarely are dreams fulfilled as romantically as in this story. From the despair of suffering rejection when he was 15, to finding work in a beetroot factory called Red Velvet on £20 per day, Rickie Lambert’s life’s ambition to play for Liverpool will be officially realised in the next 48 hours.

This transfer, a closely-guarded secret as negotiations progressed this week, shows that old-fashioned  values and a refusal never to give up will ultimately be rewarded.

Lambert could easily have gone the way of thousands of other young hopefuls when Liverpool released him in 1997, shuffling around the non-League circuit harbouring frustrations over what might have been, but it wasn’t only his mother who had faith that the picture would not be bleak.

Hughie McAuley, one of the most influential coaches at Liverpool’s academy, remembers a talented  goalscorer who was always eager to please, and a resolute teenager who had been raised in working-class Kirkby with stout ethics.

‘Rickie was always a strong lad and had an eye for goal that has stayed with him,’ said McAuley, whose late father, Hugh, scouted Lambert when he was a schoolboy and urged Liverpool to take a look. ‘But he always worked very hard, he wanted to learn and he was determined.

‘It’s never easy to let kids leave, and it wasn’t easy to break the news to Rickie. But our job at the academy is to give those who don’t make it as much information and help as we can and he took it on board. He comes from good Liverpool stock.

‘The desire to work hard and have dedication should be a pre- requisite — look at Steven Gerrard and Jamie  Carragher — but not every footballer has it. With Ricky, they were his biggest qualities and it’s why we had confidence he would go on to earn a living from the game.

‘Our paths crossed a few years later, when he was with Southampton (in 2009) and I was working at Stockport. He scored a poacher’s goal from six yards, they won 2-0. I gave him a hug afterwards and wished him all the best. Isn’t it great that it has gone full circle for him? He will be elated.’

When Lambert has his medical today, with a two-year contract at Liverpool agreed, it is inevitable his mind will flood with memories of the journey he has been on, the first stopping points being Blackpool, Macclesfield and Rochdale.

‘Rickie was a rough  diamond,’ recalls Steve Parkin, his manager at Rochdale. ‘He had an eye for goal. All we had to do was tidy his professionalism up a little bit. He was blessed with natural ability that not many players are given. That is what set him apart from the rest.’

Rochdale will get a small cut of the £4million fee Southampton receive after they negotiated a sell-on when he moved to Bristol Rovers, who will in turn benefit after inserting a clause when selling him to Southampton.

It was on the south coast that Lambert blossomed, with 106 goals in 207 leagues games. The catalyst for this blistering run of form, which took him all the way to the England squad, was a prod from Alan Pardew, who questioned his professionalism.

‘That really stuck,’ he recalled before his England debut against Scotland last August. ‘I was overweight, basically. I wasn’t looking after my body.’

His first cap brought a first goal, a towering header from a Leighton Baines cross, and left his mum and dad, Ray, in tears. Not long after that, a fax arrived at Southampton from Brendan Rodgers. 

‘He is a terrific player and I sent the message on behalf of the club and all Kopites as he is a big Red,’ Rodgers explained last September.

‘He is a Kirkby boy and I was just wishing him well, saying we were all proud of him playing for England. I’ve been a big admirer of Rickie.’

And now, against the odds, Lambert’s dreams have come true.
