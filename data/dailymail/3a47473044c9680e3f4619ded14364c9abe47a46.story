A lone gunman has gone on a shooting rampage in rural Pennsylvania, killing three people including a woman who was decorating a church for a children's Christmas party.

Jeffrey Lee Michael, 44, of Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, shot dead Kimberly A. Scott, 58, William Harrison Rhodes Jr., 38, and his father-in-law, Kenneth Lynn before state troopers killed him in a firefight.

The shocking shooting spree came a week to the day that 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza shot dead his mother and 26 innocent school children and staff in Newtown, Connecticut, before turning the gun on himself.

Michael's first victim was reportedly 
Scott, of Duncansville, who was decorating Juniata Valley Gospel Church 
in Frankstown Township for Christmas Friday morning when shots rang out 
and bullets pierced through a window.

Michael entered the church and shot Scott, then fled in a truck, leaving another woman who was with her unharmed.

Michael then allegedly shot Rhodes and Lynn in the 
driveway of a home after a confrontation at a stop sign, one of the 
men's cousins, Marie Brenneman, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

'This person went to their driveway with a pistol, pointed at them and started shooting,' Brenneman said.

She said the shooter was a neighbor of Rhodes and Lynn.

'They were uneasy around him,' she said.

Rhodes' sister, Marie, mourned the loss of her brother on Facebook.

'Today
is the worst day of my life,' she wrote. 'My brother and his 
father-in-law were shot and killed today by some psychopath. I hope 
[people] with mental problems really start getting help, so s**t like 
this stops happening.'

Victim William Rhodes worked at 
Grannas Brothers, a construction and contracting firm based in 
Hollidaysburg, according to his Facebook profile.

State police said late on Friday that they were still trying
to piece together a timeline and motive.

The gunman and the victims 
weren't related, 
Blair County District Attorney Rich Consiglio said.

Investigators said they were looking into the relationship, if any, between Michael and his victims.

Rhodes' sister, Marie, mourned the loss of her brother on Facebook. 'Today is the worst day of my life,' she wrote

They said victims may have a connection, but officials would not give any further details.

'It's going to take us some time to 
put this all together ... and know exactly what occurred,' said Lt. Col.
George Bivens, deputy state police commissioner.

Investigators are processing five crime scenes within about a 1.5-mile radius.

The rampage ended when troopers chased Michael down and killed him in a shootout.

Three troopers in patrol cars were 
injured in the pursuit that began after the gunman, driving a pick-up 
truck, fired at them, police said.

One trooper injured a wrist and then 
was hit in the chest but was saved by a bulletproof vest.

A second trooper was injured by glass 
fragments in his eye and bullet fragments that hit him in the forehead, 
Bivens said.

The third trooper suffered minor injuries from the head-on 
crash, he said.

'I think we have three very fortunate 
state police members tonight,' Bivens said. 'We are very thankful for 
the fact that they survived this attack. Someone was watching over 
them.'

The woman at Juniata Valley Gospel 
Church had cooked food the day before for the funeral of the church's 
longtime pastor, said the Rev. James McCaulley, his brother.

The church 
was still reeling from the Rev. David McCaulley's death when the woman 
returned to decorate its hall - named after the pastor of 58 years - and
bullets ripped through a window, he said.

James McCaulley, who is the pastor of
another church about 50 miles away from the site of Friday's carnage, 
said his older brother began leading the Frankstown church in 1954.

'He preached his last sermon at the church in October before he fell ill,' McCaulley said.

Despite fatal shootings being in the news on a daily basis, there has been no comprehensive tally of gun deaths in America.

The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence claims that more than 96,217 people have been shot so far this year in a tally on its website, but the information is estimated based on the number of gun injuries and deaths recorded by the CDC in 2008 and 2009 - the latest years statistics were released.

The lack of reliable, up-to-date data has spurred on an anonymous pacifist to start keeping track using the Twitter feed @GunDeaths.

Since the Aurora, Colorado, movie theatre massacre in July, the feed's creator has tweeted every reported shooting death he can find.

And after the Sandy Hook school shooting, website Slate is using that information to compile an interactive feature called 'gun deaths in America since Newtown'.

According to the data, there have already been 120.

The church, which lists about 150 
members in an online want ad posted this month for an associate pastor, 
is close-knit, and the woman killed Friday was among its more active 
members, McCaulley said. She had made food for him to take home Thursday
since his wife had died this year, he said.

'The only thing I can say good at 
this time is that [the gunman] didn't do this 24 hours earlier when 
there was a big crowd in the church hall,' McCaulley said. 'We're 
devastated.'

Friday's shootings were the second involving a rural Pennsylvania church this month and came exactly a week after the devastating Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre, which shook the nation on December 14.

On that fateful day, 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza used his mother Nancy's prized Bushmaster AR-15 rifle and two other guns to shoot her dead at point-blank range in the home they shared.

He then descended on the Newtown elementary school where he shot dead 20 six and seven-year-olds and six staff members, including the school's principal, before killing himself.

The shocking massacre has reignited the debate around gun control in America, with President Barack Obama tasking Vice President Joe Biden with working up proposals to restrict access to weapons by January.

The Pennsylvania shooting happened as the National Rifle Association made their first announcement  since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The group's CEO Wayne LaPierre put 
the blame for the mass shootings on violent media, rejected new gun 
control measures and called for more security in the nation's schools.

'The only way to stop a bad guy with a
gun is with a good guy with a gun,' LaPierre said at the press 
conference in Washington D.C.

'I call on Congress today to 
appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every 
single school in this nation,' he said.

LaPierre's statement did not go 
unchallenged, with two protestors interrupting him with banners blaming 
the NRA for school shootings who were then escorted out of the 
conference.

Millions of Americans observed a minute's silence at 9.30am yesterday to remember the 26 
victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting.

Church bells tolled 26 times for the 
20 young children and six teaching staff shot dead by a gunman who broke
into the Newtown school in Connecticut in one of the deadliest school shootings in 
American history.
