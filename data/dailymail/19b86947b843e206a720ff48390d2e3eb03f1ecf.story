One Direction fans have long been highly visible on Twitter, but the boyband's true dominance of the social networking site was confirmed today.

Twitter announced that three of the year's top five tweets came from members of the British group, who between them have over 90million followers - much more than any other band or musician.

However, the event which triggered the fastest trending alert on the site was altogether more sombre - the death of fiction writer Iain Banks had the biggest response from Twitter users in 2013.

On top: British boyband One Direction dominated the list of the world's top tweets from 2013

Popular: This tweet by Niall Horan was the third most retweeted of the year

Fans: More than 327,000 'Directioners' have retweeted this photo of Harry Styles asleep in bed

Thanks: Zayn Malik posted this tweet after announcing his engagement to Perrie Edwards of Little Mix

Many members of One Direction's teenage fanbase are keen Twitter users, and three of the messages sent out by the band made it into the list of the five most retweeted.

Irish band member Niall Horan had the third top tweet of the year after more than 367,000 users retweeted a message saying: 'Yesss! I'm 20! Wohooo! No more teens!'

Zayn Malik occupied fourth and fifth spots on the list, with a picture of bandmate Harry Styles asleep in bed and a tweet thanking fans for their warm wishes after he announced his engagement to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards.

The most retweeted message of all came from Glee actress Lea Michele following the death of her boyfriend and co-star Cory Monteith.

Mr Banks's death started trending faster than any other item of UK news, including the birth of Prince George and the death of Margaret Thatcher.

Scottish author: The June death of 59-year-old Iain Banks (pictured) became a 'trend' - a topic that causes sharp peaks in Twitter activity - faster than any other item of UK news throughout the whole of 2013

Tribute: Spandau Ballet star Gary Kemp was one of thousands of web users who took to Twitter in the wake of Iain Banks's death

The author, who was suffering from cancer, passed away in June aged 59. And the announcement of his death prompted a swarm of online activity, according to the Year on Twitter report.

Mr Banks's name immediately started trending on Twitter, and the annual review shows that this created a greater surge of online activity than any other event.

The annual report breaks trends down into different subject headings including sport, politics, music and UK news.

October’s St Jude storm, which caused widespread damage across the UK, was second in the UK news shortlist - with people using the social networking site to warn others of perils and offer condolences to families of the dead and injured.

Their interest was also captured by 
discussions about the NHS, in third place, the death of Irish poet 
Seamus Heaney in fourth, and Coronation Street character Ken Barlow, in 
fifth.

Hot topic: The arrival of Prince George this summer, which prompted thousands to gather outside royal landmarks in the days before and after his birth, saw 'RoyalBaby' become number six in the top-ten list

Trending: The hashtag #royalbaby was used by tweeters such as U.S. reality star Snooki

Discussed: October's St Jude storm, which caused widespread damage across the UK, was second in the UK news shortlist. A fallen tree is pictured following the weather event in Hounslow, west London

Worries: Another storm earlier this month provoked a flurry of tweets from Twitter users

The actor who plays him, Bill Roache, is currently facing a trial over allegations of historic sexual offences against five girls.

And the arrival of Prince George this summer, which prompted thousands to gather outside royal landmarks in the days before and after his birth, saw ‘#RoyalBaby’ become number six in the top-ten list, followed by X Factor winner James Arthur at seven.

‘Thatcher’, which began trending following Mrs Thatcher’s death in April, is at number eight, ahead of ‘Richard III’, whose remains were discovered in August, at nine.

And at the bottom of the shortlist the news that Hull was to be named ‘City of Culture 2017’ was the tenth most frequently trended topic.

Of course, it is not just news events that have caused sharp peaks in Twitter activity. And other shortlists were formed to reveal the top trending topics for international news, people, music, politics, TV, football, other sport and events.

Popular discussion: Liverpool's Uruguayan player Luis Suarez was the most frequently trended footballer on Twitter. He is pictured here in the infamous incident in April where he bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic

Mixed reception: Suarez also received praise for his good form on the pitch, including this message from commentator Gabby Logan

Pop star Justin Bieber – whose overwhelming popularity has seen him likened to the Fab Four in their Beatlemania heyday – trended more than any other musician in 2013.

And football fans caused Liverpool's Uruguayan star Luis Suarez to become the equivalent for the game, with The Ashes topping a list of other sports.

In television, #bbctw – used to mark tweets about BBC1’s This Week programme – was number one, while in politics it was the right-wing UKIP party.

And Christmas was the most frequently trended event, ahead of New Year’s Eve, Easter and Halloween.

The trends that each individual person sees when they log on to the site depend on their settings, such as where they are located and which other accounts they are following.

Individual events can attract more than one trend on the micro blogging site – for example the birth of Prince George which was marked by at least three – and these were not collated for the purpose of the report.

Hashtag: In TV, #bbctw - used to mark tweets about BBC's This Week programme - was number one
