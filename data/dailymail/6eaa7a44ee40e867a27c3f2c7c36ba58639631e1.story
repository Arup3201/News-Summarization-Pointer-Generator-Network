A teenage boy who had been shot by his grandmother pleaded with a 
911 dispatcher to send help as the 75-year-old shot him again, a 
prosecutor told jurors on Tuesday.

Sandra Layne is on trial for the first-degree murder of her grandson Jonathan Hoffman, 17, whom she is accused of shooting dead on May 18 last year at their shared home in suburban Detroit.

Hoffman 'thought he was safe... Sandra Layne walks up and 
shoots him again. This time in the stomach,' Paul Walton, Oakland 
County's chief assistant prosecutor, said during his opening statement today.

Defense attorney Jerome 
Sabbota countered that the diminutive Layne feared for her safety during
the fatal confrontation in the West Bloomfield Township 
condo that Hoffman shared with his grandparents.

An autopsy revealed 
Hoffman was shot three times in the chest, once in the abdomen and once 
in his left arm. Tests showed the teen had traces of synthetic marijuana
in his body.

Officers had been called to the home northwest of 
Detroit about two months earlier, when Layne told police she was having a
difficult time because her grandson was very upset and yelling. No 
arrests were made that day.

Four days before that, the alternative high school senior was 
pulled over in nearby Farmington Hills and ticketed for possession of 
marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

Layne is 'not a 
murderer,' Sabbota told jurors on Tuesday. 'She was afraid. She felt she 
had no choice. Why else would she shoot him? This is a tragic case.'

Hoffman was living with his grandmother while his mother and father were divorcing and living outside Michigan.

'He was a troubled teen, her favorite grandson, and she took him in,' Sabbota said.

In
Hoffman's 911 call played during Layne's preliminary examination last 
summer, the teen yelled into a cellphone: 'I've just been shot. My 
grandma shot me. I'm going to die. Help.'

A few minutes later, he 
tells the operator: 'I got shot, shot again. Please help. Help,' before 
his voice trails off and a woman's shouts are heard in the background.

An
officer testified at Layne's preliminary examination that when police 
arrived, she walked out of her home with her hands up and screamed: 'I 
murdered my grandson.'

A Glock 9mm semiautomatic handgun was found just inside the front door. Nine spent cartridge cases also were found in the house.

Sabbota said Layne is expected to take the stand during the trial.

Crime scene: When police arrived on the scene they found Hoffman unresponsive with eight bullet wounds
