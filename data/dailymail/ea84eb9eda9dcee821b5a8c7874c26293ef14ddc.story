Amy Willerton has quickly established herself as the jungle beauty on ITV's I'm A Celebrity ...Get Me Out Of Here! - just ask her new admirer, Joey Essex.

But the 21-year-old, who reached the semi-finals of the Miss Universe title in Russia recently, had a helping hand when it came to appearing bare-faced in the outback.

We can reveal that Amy underwent a series of skin peels, vitamin injections, abdominal toning sessions and micro-needle treatments in preparation for her debut on the show, which was watched by 9.2m viewers.

Tricks of the trade: Beauty queen Amy Willerton, who is currently a star on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, had a helping hand to achieve that bare-faced beauty look for her stint in the outback

Appearing in public without make-up was 
something of a personal challenge for Amy, who experienced problems with
 her skin as a teenager. 

'Working as model, her face is her fortune so she recently underwent a facial preparation campaign 
under the professional auspices of Dr Vincent Wong, who is an Advanced 
Medical Aesthetics Practitioner,' said a spokesman.

'Amy suffered from chronic acne in her late teens and whilst it 
has left her unscarred, she wanted to ensure it was in peak condition 
for November,' explained Dr Wong. 

'Her treatment also included a series of skin peels, vitamin injections and micro-needling treatments.

Dr Wong told Femail: 'Signs of stress can show on the skin, even on someone as young as Amy.'

Beauty queen: Amy was treated to a range of treatments from Slendertone, which claims to help enhance your complexion by ridding the face of toxins

'We want to restore her skin radiance
 and elasticity as well as preventing breakouts and dark circles from 
forming as a result of excessive stress. We want her to look as 
confident as she feels in her own skin.'

The
 21-year-old beauty queen has been seeing Dr. Vincent Wong on weekly 
basis since she was crowned Miss Universe Great Britain in June this 
year.

He
 designed a unique skin treatment for her, named ‘Pure and Radiant’. 
Involving caviar and bird's nest extracts, it's due to be launched to 
the general public in October, just in time for the festive season.

Amy was also treated to a range of treatments from Slendertone.

Dr Wong introduced Amy to Slendertone Face, a treatment that claims to stimulate facial circulation, improve complexion and bring about a glowing radiance.

Facing up: Amy, who has been getting close to Joey Essex on the show (L), used the Slendertone Face device (R) to get her complexion in peak condition for her stint in the jungle

'Amy used her Slendertone Face to improve the circulation, encourage the removal of toxins and ensure she radiates health and vitality from every pore.'

Slendertone Face directs electronic muscle stimulation (EMS) via a headset to encourage natural muscle contractions, so exercising the face involuntarily.

Facial muscles are directly attached to 
skin and as they are correctly exercised by the Slendertone Face without contorting the 
overlying skin, the blood flow to the dermis escalates which increases 
oxygenation and clears the build-up of toxins

Speaking about her treatment, Amy said: 'Slendertone Face already gives me a lovely glow after I use it – I just pop on the headset and forget I am treating my face – which is great as I have so many things I have to do at the moment.'

And Amy didn't just concentrate on her face.

To prepare for the shower shots in the jungle, personal trainer Jarod Chapman designed a training programme to help tone her abdomen. 

As part of this, Jarod got Amy to use a £149.99 Slendertone Ab Belt every day for twenty minutes to improve her muscle definition and tone.

Amy wore the belt - which contracts your stomach muscles to give them a work out - while getting ready to go out, as well as in the gym.

But is Amy's beauty blitz safe?

Dr Dennis Wolf, Cosmetic Doctor at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'This is a product which uses neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in an attempt to contract the muscles on the abdomen. This will probably create a similar sort of feeling for the user as is experienced after doing a series of sit ups or abdominal crunches in the gym.

'But while the technology will probably make the abdominal muscles feel slightly tighter for a few hours after wearing the belt, I am not convinced that we can confidently say the product offers any long-term benefits in terms of toning or tightening the stomach muscles.'

Work out: The belt used by Amy creates a similar sort of feeling as is experienced after doing a series of sit ups or abdominal crunches in the gym, says an expert

Speaking about Amy's face treatments, Dr Yannis, MD of 111 Harley Street, said: 'Amy is a relatively young Slendertone customer, and at the age of 21 is taking a highly preventive approach to sagging skin.

'This gadget is most effective on women over the age of 30, the age when muscle volume and collagen starts to deplete within the face.

'In terms of safety, the Slendertone Face is a non invasive treatment that increases blood flow to the skin, a process which will have helped with Amy’s quest for glowing skin. However, the Slendertone Face is not an anti-acne treatment will not necessarily help to keep Amy’s skin spot free.

'I would recommend that Amy maintains a dedicated skincare regime throughout her time in the jungle to avoid breakouts.'
