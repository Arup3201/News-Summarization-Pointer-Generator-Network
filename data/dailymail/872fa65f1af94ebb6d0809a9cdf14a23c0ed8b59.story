A dog owner stapled his pet's face together with a staple gun after using the animal for badger bating.

Comet, believed to be about three-years-old, was dumped outside a vets when his owner realised they couldn't treat his horrific wounds.

Staff at Hull Animal Welfare Trust's Sunnydene Shelter in South Cave, East Yorkshire, were appalled when they saw Comet's face which had been torn by the badger.

Road to recovery: Amy Bryan with Comet whose face was stapled together by his cruel owner

Amy Bryan, 32, manager of the shelter, said: 'Comet must have gone through excruciating pain and suffering when the staples were stuck to his face.

'The stapler that was used would have been the type that you find on your desk at work.

'There were at least ten staples on his mouth and up to his jawline.'

The badger managed to tear off the entire bottom of Comet’s face and he was left with wounds right up to his eyes.

Ms Bryan said: 'None of us at this centre have ever seen this kind of cruelty happen to an animal before.'

Comet, who was injured in Lancashire, has been a resident at the shelter since last November.

Ms Bryan said: 'When his wound started to break down, the owners figured out they couldn’t fix his face after all and just cruelly dumped him outside a vets.

'Comet came to us with no collar and no paperwork documenting the past owners, so we haven’t been able to bring them to justice for such a horrific crime.

'What the owners did was illegal and it’s hard to describe the pain Comet will have been put under.'

Comet still suffers from slight numbness in his jaw from his injuries but is now eating as usual.

Ms Bryan said: 'The vets in Lancashire have done a wonderful job in their initial treatment for him.

'We then provided more treatment for Comet when he arrived in our shelter.'

Now looking for a new home, Ms Bryan explained Comet needs a loving carer who has experience in handling lurchers.

'Comet needs an experienced handler, someone with no small animals or children because Comet has been forcibly trained to grab hold of anything smaller than him,' she said.

'It’s such a shame as he’s very affectionate with people and walks well on a lead like any other dog.

'Someone with experience in handling this breed would be helpful as the expertise would be invaluable.

Needs a home: Comet is recovering from his ordeal and hopes a new owner will come forward

'One man who helps trains Lurchers to calm their behaviour said to me that the more the badger fights back, the more the dog is urged to go and attack.

'But above all, he’s a very big, strong dog and we found him to be a lovely companion.'

The charity, formed 30 years ago, charges £125 for a dog and £70 for a cat.
