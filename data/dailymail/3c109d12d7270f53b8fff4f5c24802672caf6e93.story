The CEO of Australia's dominant taxi payment provider has hit out at app-based transport services saying they are unregulated, don't have insurance and offer little accountability.

Cabcharge CEO Andrew Skelton's rant on Wednesday followed news that Uber, a transport app friendly business, had expanded its Australian venture into the lucrative corporate market.

Mr Skelton told Business Insider Australia that Cabcharge-related apps were available 'long before the so called innovators arrived'.

'Cabcharge is an Australian company offering Australian corporate travellers the ubiquity of using legal authorised Taxis everywhere in Australia from their homes, offices, Airports and Taxis on the street and having the Government controlled fares charged to corporate travel accounts,' he said.

'Other start-up services are available piecemeal, are not available everywhere, are illegal in most jurisdictions, and their drivers do not necessarily require the same range of background, police or medical checks.

'We believe our community deserves better than someone in their own car with little accountability, no insurance and no regulation.'

Cabcharge made roughly $60 million in profit in 2012 and 2013 but now faces competition from companies like Uber (pictured) who are simplifying their app-based services

'Some app-based business are notorious for different and unpredictable charges at different times, and for taking up to 20 percent of the driver’s fare. To Cabcharge it’s about ensuring your people are safe and your expenses are controllable.,' Mr Skelton said.
