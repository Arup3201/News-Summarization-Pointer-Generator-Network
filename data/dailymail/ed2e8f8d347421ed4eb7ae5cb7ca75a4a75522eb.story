Frank Lampard may not have moved to New York just quite yet but his soon-to-be team-mate David Villa has landed in America ahead of the new season.

Villa, who joined New York City FC on a three-year deal in June, posted an Instagram picture of himself at the Rockefeller Center.

The 33-year-old moved to Melbourne City FC on a short-term deal at the start of the summer in order to maintain his fitness ahead of the 2015 MLS campaign, which starts in March.

And Villa insists the MLS is not a step down from his time at the likes of Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Valencia.

Villa, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, said of his move to the US: 'Football players never talk about steps forward or steps back. It makes little sense among athletes.

'For me, the MLS league is a league that today is not at the height of the European league but may be in the future, and nothing is a step backward.

'I see it as an advance in my career, and I hope this step ahead from Europe to America is important for me.'

Former Spain forward Villa has revealed he has already settled into life in the Big Apple after moving to America at the back end of 2014. 

He added: 'I’ve been living here since September. In September the girls started school. In October I went to play with the other team [Melbourne City], but since September we are based in the city of New York. 

'We are very happy and excited, and we hope it stays that way in the future.' 

Lampard is expected to join Villa and the rest of his New York City team-mates in July after extending his deal with Premier League champions Manchester City.
