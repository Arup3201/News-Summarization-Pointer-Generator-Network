Fred has retired from international football after Brazil's disappointing World Cup campaign came to an end.

The 30-year-old, who has 39 caps for his country, became a scapegoat for Brazil fans' criticism after some questionable displays this campaign.

Down: Fred became a scapegoat for many Brazil fans in the latter stages of the competition

Back then: Fred was top scorer at the Confederations Cup last year, which Brazil won

Fred was subject of hostile jeers from
 the hosts whenever he touched the ball during the embarrassing 7-1 
defeat to Germany in Belo Horizonte.

This
 comes just a year after the Fluminense striker was awarded the Silver 
Shoe for top scorer with five goals in the Confederations Cup, which 
Brazil won as hosts.

Fred scored his first goals for Brazil in an 8-0 friendly win over UAE in 2005, and scored two World Cup goals for the Selecao.

Decent record: Fred played 39 times for Brazil, scoring 18 times since 2005
