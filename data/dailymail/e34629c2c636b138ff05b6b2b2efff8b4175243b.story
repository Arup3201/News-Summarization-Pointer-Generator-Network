A generous managing director has treated 20 hard-up families to Christmas dinner with all the trimmings.

Roy Ganley, 49, had filled four supermarket trolleys with £500 of groceries and arrived unannounced at a foodbank in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

The food is now being distributed to families who faced the tough choice of whether to heat their homes, buy their children gifts or be able to eat this Christmas.

Roy, a father-of-two from Westhoughton, Bolton, said: 'It was something I wanted to do. I've never known there to be foodbanks before. People are struggling.

'I discussed it with my wife Lesley and the family and they were all for it.' 

The shocked minister at Farnworth Baptist Church's The Well foodbank, John Bradbury, said the donation would make a 'tremendous' difference.

'We did not know he was doing this until he turned up with his van,' he added. 

The 49-year-old filled four supermarket trollies which his huge shopping list which included 20 chickens, 20 bags of potatoes and 20 bags of tangerines

'It shows that people do care, and are prepared to think of others. The food bought will make a tremendous difference to the people in Farnworth and Kearsley.' 

Mr Ganley, who has two daughters, Charlotte, 22, and Natalie, 20, added: 'There will be people on Christmas day without a food on the table.

20 chickens

20 jellies

20 bags of potatoes

20 bags of apples

20 bags of tangerines

20 jars of coffee

20 bags of sugar

20 bags of pasta

20 trays of eggs

20 bags of carrots

20 boxes of tea bags

'It is just through the love of God that it is not me or you.

'You never know what can happen - things can go up or down and this is a way of putting back into the community.

'When I put it on Facebook asking for information a couple of people said it was a great idea and they would donate something too.

'Everybody can do something that will make a difference to somebody - 20 families will now have a good day.'

Mr Ganley, a managing director at Bolton-based vehicle finance company First Step UK, was given a discount on his traditional Christmas fare by bosses at Lidl who also donated items to the foodbank after his big shop.

Family friend Niki Ashton, who helped the  49-year-old back with his food-laden trolley after the shopping trip, said it had been a 'selfless act.'

'He has bought enough food for 20 families on Christmas day and for a few days afterwards - it is a most selfless thing to do and it is what Christmas is about,' she added.
