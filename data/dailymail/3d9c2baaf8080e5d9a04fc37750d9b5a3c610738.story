A suburban Los Angeles town is outraged after learning a serial rapist is moving in - and they aren't going down without a fight.

Christopher Hubbart, 62, dubbed the ‘Pillowcase Rapist’ after being linked to dozens of sexual assaults on women during the 1970s and 80s, has been cleared to move to a Lake Los Angeles home close to a park, multiple schools and a bus stop.

The depraved man has admitted to 41 rapes, but said there were about 70 unreported, according CBS Los Angeles. He is being released into the area because he previously resided in Los Angeles, officials said.

A very sick man: Christopher Hubbart admitted to raping 38 women, but said about 70 other rapes went unreported

Announced earlier this week during a hearing in San Jose, the conditions of Mr Hubbart’s release are sealed – people living on the street he is targeted to live on by the end of this year are not happy.

‘I have a daughter, so this isn't going to work for me,’ Bart Stone told NBC Bay Area.

Also seen in a CBS Los Angeles report, Mr Stone stood in front of the house and pointed about 100 feet down the street to a school bus stop.

‘That’s where children get off,’ he angrily shouted.

The home is within a few miles of two schools and only 2,200 feet from a nearby park – just outside the limits of Jessica’s Law, which prohibits predators from living closer than 2,000 feet to any park or school.

Home sweet home: This is the Lake Los Angeles home officials have decided will house the serial rapist

‘The bus stop is right in front of my house, with all the kids,’ Steve Villavicincio told CBS Los Angeles, ‘I don’t know what the heck’s going on with that.’

Markeisha Brooks, 19, pointed to three houses where children live, telling CBS Los Angeles that ‘a lot of children live around here… he’s a rapist and he can do it again.’

Mr Hubbart was put on parole multiple times, and kept raping women in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, terrorizing the state with his deviancy.

Furious: Bart Stone says he has no choice but to move if the rapist relocates to the neighborhood

Just a door down from a bus stop: 'You see that right there, past the PT Cruiser, that's where the drop the kids off' Mr Stone points to and explains

Officials are also united in their displeasure to dump the rapist in the community.

The pervert’s most recent sojourn back into custody came because he couldn’t control his violent urges, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich told KNX.

‘He belongs in a mental institution, a state hospital’ Mr Antonovich said during a recent press conference, ‘he does not belong in a community with children where he will once again commit these crimes.’

‘His past behavior is not a one-time occurrence where he made a mistake. We’re talking over and over again,’ Mr Antonovich added.

So many arrests: Mr Hubbart was released into parole multiple times, and he assaulted women every single time - forcing officials to arrest and reincarcerate him

‘They're taking someone who is not from here — who has a horrific criminal record — and they're dumping him in the [area],’ a Palmdale city spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times.

‘We don't think that's right,’ the spokesperson added.

Palmdale is only a handful of miles from the home slated to house Mr Hubbart.

California authorities are giving the public until Nov 29 to voice their concerns. A website has been set up for locals to submit comments.

The modest ranch home was recently listed for rent on Craigslist. The ad asked $850 for the three bedroom, two bath house - it is no longer on the site.

'That's crazy': Steve Villavicincio lives next door, the bus stop is in front of his home, he cannot believe officials think the home is suitable for a rapist

Not in our neighborhood!: Residents are furious the predator is set to live only feet from a school bus stop and within a few miles of multiple schools

Mr Stone called the home’s owner during a local media report, furiously asking if he knew who the rapist was and asking why he’d rent to him.

Other locations are also being considered, an official told the Times, but it will be in Los Angeles County.

Mr Hubbart was first arrested in 1972 for multiple rapes in southern California, he soon admitted raping 20 women, records cited by the Times show.

Only seven years later, he was released from a mental health institution after doctors deemed him a changed man. He was snagged again in 1982 for raping more women.

Based on his own estimates, Mr Hubbart raped well over 100 women.

‘It really angers me,’ another local resident told the Times. ‘My wife and I are getting to the point where we're anxious to leave California anyway. That might get us to... move quicker.’

Mr Hubbart will be required to wear a GPS monitor at all times, an official told the Times.

The monitor will be able to alert authorities if he violates the terms of his release by beng to close to a school or park, or even if he violates curfew.

Still, that’s not enough to satisfy people living in the proposed area.

‘This is like a bad dream right now because I'm going to have to move out of this neighborhood,’ Mr Stone told NBC Bay Area

He doesn’t appear to be alone.
