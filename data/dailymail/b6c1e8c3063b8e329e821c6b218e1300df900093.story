A man who claimed to have killed three people is under investigation after police found a woman's body on Monday.

Clayton Courtney, 28, was arrested at his home after he allegedly stabbed his roommate on Sunday night in Janesville, Wisconsin.

Police reported that prior to the stabbing, Courtney said: 'I've already killed three people tonight. We are all going to die.'

Clayton Courtney, 28, has been arrested after allegedly stabbing his roommate in Janesville, Wisconsin on Sunday night. He was arrested on Sunday covered in blood and dirt

He also threatened the unborn child of a female roommate and tried to set a car on fire in an adjoining garage to the home.

The 32-year-old woman and her two children who also live at the home were uninjured.

He was arrested covered in mud and blood. Investigators said that the mud covering his body was not the same as that at the home on Pontiac Drive.

The male stabbing victim, 28, was taken to Mercy Hospital in Janesville with multiple wounds, one of which was described by doctors as near fatal, according to the Gazette.

The following morning, officers found a woman's body behind a disused furniture store, three miles from Courtney's home.  

Police are investigating whether the dead woman is connected to Clayton. She has not been identified and the body is undergoing an autopsy to determine cause of death.

Courtney was believed to have been in the area where the woman was found after telling friends he was going to drink and do drugs with a female friend under a nearby bridge.

Police are yet unsure if Courtney is involved in the unknown woman's death. 

Janesville Police Chief David Moore told CBS: 'Taking Mr Courtney at his word, we have two additional victims in this community.'

Courtney has been 
charged with attempted first-degree reckless homicide, attempted arson, 
criminal damage and disorderly conduct.

He is being held at the Rock 
County Jail.
