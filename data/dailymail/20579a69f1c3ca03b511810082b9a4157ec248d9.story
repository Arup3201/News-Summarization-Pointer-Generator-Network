The families of a dozen of the 19 elite Arizona firefighters killed last year in the nation's worst wildfire in eight decades have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit claiming the state was negligent in its efforts to battle the massive blaze.

The wind-whipped, lightning-caused fire destroyed scores of homes and burned 8,400 acres (1900 hectares) before it was extinguished in an area around the tiny town of Yarnell, northwest of Phoenix.

The deadly blaze captured the nation's attention for weeks and marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the lives lost in the so-called Yarnell Hill Fire including compensation for funeral costs, pain and suffering, and lost income.

The families are also demanding answers to what happened to cause all but one of the Granite Mountain hotshots firefighters to be overrun by flames on June 30.

'They want to know what happened to their loved ones and they want to ensure that this tragedy never happens again,' Phoenix attorney Patrick McGroder III, who is representing the families in the lawsuit, said.

The families had notified the state, Yavapai County and the Central Yavapai Fire District of a possible lawsuit in December, offering to settle for more than $220 million.

Family members also seek a meeting with state fire officials to see what went wrong and with hopes of developing policies, procedures and other tools to change the way fires are currently fought, according to the suit filed late on Wednesday in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix.

McGroder said the state rebuffed efforts
 by the families to talk openly and honestly about the fire that trapped
 the Hotshots in a brush-choked canyon outside Yarnell, destroyed 127 
homes and scorched 13 square miles.

Named as defendants are the state and its forestry division, Yavapai County and the Central Yavapa County Fire District. Also listed are the fire officials who were responsible for managing firefighting efforts in the days leading up to the time when the 19 men were killed.

The defendants named in the lawsuit either declined comment Thursday or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

An
 attorney for the Central Yavapai Fire District, Nick Cornelius, said in
 December that he didn't believe there is a basis for claims against the
 agency or its staff.

The deadline to file a lawsuit is 
Monday, the one-year anniversary of the firefighters' deaths.

Earlier 
this week, more than 160 property owners in and around Yarnell sued the 
state, saying it failed miserably in its management of the 
lightning-sparked blaze.

An earlier investigation 
commissioned by the Arizona State Forestry Division found that state 
fire officials communicated poorly but followed proper procedures when 
the Hotshots were killed.

This is the latest legal action taken in connection with the fallout from the fire, with 162 affected property owners filing a lawsuit this week seeking compensation for their losses.

Owners also said fire officials were to blame for the loss of property and lives in the area, saying that they 'failed miserably'.

A state official declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Destroyed: The report said that by keeping crews on the mountain they were prioritizing the safety of property before the lives of its firefighters

Gov. Jan Brewer used caution in addressing potential lawsuits earlier this month. She said the agencies that produced the reports did a good job and that the deaths were an unfortunate, horrific tragedy that might spur change.

'I think that eventually it will come to the conclusion that certain, possibly different methods, techniques — call it what you wish — will be improved,' she said.

The families' lawsuit contends that fire managers didn't act quickly enough to extinguish the blaze, failed to have adequate air resources and staff on hand, didn't make the safety of firefighters a top priority and did not alert the Hotshots to the erratic fire behavior and wind that day.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in Maricopa County Superior Court include widows and fathers of 12 of the 19 Hotshots.

Relief: The wife of at least one of the 13 Granite Mountain Hotshots who died in last summer's raging Arizona wildfires and were subsequently denied survivor's benefits by the city of Prescott will now get the money to help support herself and their four kids

Missed: She had been married to Andrew Ashcraft, pictured, for seven years and they have four children

They are: Claire Caldwell, Krista 
Carter, Michael Mackenzie, Grant McKee, Daniel Parker, John Percin, 
Desiree Steed, Stephanie Turbyfill, Roxanne Warneke, Carl Whitted and 
Joseph Woyjeck.

Juliann 
Ashcraft is also suing who last month won the right to receive 
survivor's benefits from the city of Prescott to help support herself 
and their four kids.

In 
2012, President Barack Obama made federal health insurance benefits 
available to thousands of temporary wildland firefighters and their 
families after a South Dakota-based Hotshot crew petitioned for the 
change.

That benefit did not extend to the Granite Mountain Hotshots because the crew was employed by Prescott.

Somewhat
 lost in the emotion of the debate is that benefits for all the families
 of the Granite Mountain Hotshots also will include private donations.

Each
 of firefighters' families were set to receive a tax-free $328,000 lump 
sum from the federal government, Social Security benefits, workers 
compensation and free tuition for their children at Arizona 
universities.

The families
 of the six full time employees also get health insurance, an increased 
life insurance payment and the men's annual salaries.
