A gang who blew up a bank to empty its cash machine have been jailed for a total of nearly 30 years.

The five raiders attached gas canisters around the ATM at a Barclays branch in Sevenoaks, Kent, and detonated them, causing a massive explosion in the middle of the night.

The group, who carried out the raid in balaclavas and head torches, then used sledge hammers to smash their way through the front door before police could get to the scene.

Raid: The gang, wearing balaclavas and head torches, attached gas cannisters to an ATM in Gravesend, Kent, causing a massive explosion

By the time officers arrived the gang had already escaped with £19,000 after severely damaging the ATM and the bank last November.

CCTV footage showed them attaching the canisters and using a hose to detonate them before battering their way in.

They then fled the scene in in a BMW 3 Series just 20 minutes later.

Lee Spinks, 28, Danny Smith, 30, Gary Smith, 39, Luke Cassidy, 28, and Jason Selwood, 30, were arrested after an operation by the Metropolitan Police's Flying Squad, the specialist unit dedicated to investigate robberies. 

The gang had also tried to raid an ATM at Barclays in Borough Green, Kent earlier in the month. Staff there noticed the machine had been tampered with and checked CCTV to see two men attaching a hose and a gas canister to the cashpoint.

Terrifying: The raiders also used sledgehammers to smash their way through the front door of the bank

Preparation: The group used hoses to detonate the cannisters. The equipment was found outside the bank when police reached the scene

Spinks was arrested on November 11 in connection with the raid and two weeks later, Flying Squad Officers caught Smith and Cassidy as they walked towards the Borough Green bank wearing balaclavas, headtorches and carrying gas canisters.

Smith was arrested shortly afterwards while driving the getaway car and Selwood was rounded up later that morning.

Detective Inspector Mark Bedford Met’s Flying Squad, said: ‘This was an organised group of criminals who used an elaborate method to steal money from the bank.

‘The Flying Squad worked alongside our Kent colleagues to mount a quick-time proactive operation to identify and arrest them. I am confident that today’s guilty pleas are due to the quality of the evidence built up against them.

‘I would like to thank all the officers involved in this investigation from the MPS and Kent who worked around the clock to bring to a swift conclusion the activities of a dangerous criminal gang.’

Cassidy, of Maidstone, Kent, Danny Smith, of Tonbridge and Selwood, of Tonbridge, Kent, were all jailed for six years.

Gary Smith, of Sheerness, Kent was jailed for five years and four months as was Spinks of, Beckenham, Kent.
