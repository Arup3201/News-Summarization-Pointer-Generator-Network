Police Minister Damian Green mistakenly signed a law allowing England's most notorious football hooligans to attend the World Cup finals

A minister mistakenly signed a new law to allow England’s most notorious football hooligans to attend the World Cup finals this summer.

Police Minister Damian Green thought the signature he put to the legal document would ban them from Brazil.

But the dates were wrong and he barred them from just the opening day instead of the entire tournament.

The blunder would have left 2,500 of the worst troublemakers free to cause mayhem, but thankfully one of Mr Green’s team spotted the mistake and redrafted the law with the correct dates.

Every season thousands of fans arrested for hooliganism are given banning orders.

And for each World Cup, police and Home Office officials draw up measures to make sure thugs cannot attend the tournament by forcing them to surrender their passports between certain dates.

But the so-called Statutory Instrument stated a travel ban would start on June 2, ten days before the opening ceremony, but mistakenly added it would end on June 13, rather than July 13.

June 13 is the first full day of matches, while England’s opening game against Italy is on June 14.

The law was laid before Parliament on January 29, but the Home Office said officials then spotted the mistake. A corrected version went before Parliament on Thursday.

‘An amendment order was drafted immediately,’ a spokesman said.
