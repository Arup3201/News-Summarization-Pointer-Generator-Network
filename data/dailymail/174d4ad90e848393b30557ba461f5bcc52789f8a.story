Tube drivers whose salary is set to rocket to more than £50,000 a year came under fire yesterday for planning a four-day strike over pay.

They are planning to walk out on Boxing Day, bringing severe disruption to the capital.

December 26 is one of the biggest days in the retail calendar as shops – many of which are battling for survival – begin their post-Christmas sales.

Strike action: Aslef, which represents 60 per cent of the 3,500 Tube drivers, has announced four days of industrial action that will bring London to a standstill

Shoppers pour into London on Boxing Day to snap up a bargain, but the strike will prevent many travelling into the capital.

The walkout is being organised by the 
transport union Aslef. It balloted 2,200 of its members, who make up 
around 60 per cent of London Underground drivers.

Of those who voted, 92.3 per cent 
voted ‘yes’ to industrial action. They are asking for extra money to 
work on Boxing Day. One source said they would agree to triple pay and a
day off in lieu for working on the bank holiday.

Disruption will be worse if members of the RMT - led by Bob Crow - refuse to cross the picket line

Aslef warned that it will take further
action on January 16 and on February 3 and 13 if no agreement is 
reached with Tube bosses.

Last Christmas, Tube drivers did not receive a special bonus for working Boxing Day.

London Underground said Aslef and 
other unions had signed up to an agreement that saw them getting higher 
salaries and increased leave on the understanding that this would 
involve working on some public holidays. Earlier this year it was 
announced that Tube drivers would get a £1,800 bonus in return for not 
going on strike during the Olympics.

The average Briton with a full-time 
job earns around £26,000. Tube drivers’ pay is expected to rise to 
almost double that during their current four-year pay deal.

A spokesman for London mayor Boris 
Johnson said: ‘It is appalling and wrong that at a time when many 
Londoners are enduring a decline in salary in real terms and rising 
living costs that the union are asking for more money for something 
already included in their salaries.’

Colin Stanbridge, chief executive of 
the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, accused Aslef of ‘holding 
London and its businesses to ransom’.

Christmas crush: Tube drivers will stage the first of four one-day walkouts on Boxing Day - hitting the shopping plans of hundreds of thousands of people

'Retailers have 
already had one of their toughest years with recent sales figures 
showing a decline year-on-year fuelled by poor consumer confidence, 
rising unemployment and mild weather.

'The last thing they need now is 
disruption on Boxing Day, one of their most important trading dates.

'We 
urge Aslef to consider the damage their actions will cause to the London
economy and reconsider their decision.'

Walkout: Underground trains sit idle during a previous strike. The overwhelming majority of Aslef members balloted voted in favour of action

Howard Collins, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: 'It is disgraceful for the Aslef leadership to threaten strike action while we are engaged in continuing discussions on this issue.

'The threat of strike action will not achieve anything and I urge Aslef to join us in our commitment to resolve this matter through discussions.

'London Underground has a long-standing agreement with all of its trade unions which cover staff working arrangements on bank holidays, and Boxing Day is included in that agreement.

'However, we have shown good faith in reviewing Boxing Day services so that staffing requirements are lower than when Aslef raised this matter last year, and Aslef should do the same.'

A spokesman for Transport for London added: 'The services we have put on in the past on Boxing Day when there has been strike action have kept London moving and less people have come into the capital.

'It is something that is endurable. Their further strikes as the economy is trying to pick up at the start of 2013, are a different order of things.

'This is intended to be as disruptive as possible.'
