A split-second decision to stick a leg out has left a college football team cheerleader in a lot of trouble.

Jarid Atkinson, a member of the Oklahoma State cheer squad, was caught on camera apparently trying to trip a player as he celebrated a game-ending touchdown.

As Oklahoma's Eric Striker ran past him with his hands in the air, Atkinson extended a foot onto the playing field at Boone Pickens Stadium.

Atkinson claimed he wasn't trying to trip the player in the 33-24 Bedlam win against University of Oklahoma Sooners and did not touch him.

It happened as Saturday's game ended in chaos. Tensions between the two sides boiled over and supporters started pelting drinks onto the pitch.

Atkinson reportedly told OSU deputy athletic director Dave Martin that he was just playfully sticking his foot out in a mocking manner.

But the act has become a hot topic on social media with a clip of the 'trip' going viral.

Martin said the cheer squad member will be disciplined and added that the moment should be considered a learning experience going forward, NewsOK.com reported.

Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said: 'In accord with the Conference’s Sportsmanship and Ethical Conduct policy, Mr Atkinson's attempt to trip an Oklahoma football player was in violation of the rule prohibiting physically or verbally abusive acts toward an opponent’s team members during a contest.

'I appreciate the cooperation of Oklahoma State athletic director Mike Holder in handling this matter and accept Mr Atkinson’s public apology for his action.'
