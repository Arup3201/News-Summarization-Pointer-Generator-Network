Although he will be 80 in March, conductor Sir Roger Norrington shows no signs of slowing down. His engagements diary is booked three years in advance and he travels worldwide to conduct 50 concerts a year.

As well as all this, there is his annual stint at the Proms, where  he has taken to the podium for the past 30 years.

Now he also has to organise the sale of his house – a late Victorian gem near Newbury in Berkshire, on the market at £2,995,000, which he has only recently finished renovating. Yet he makes light of his busy schedule.

Impressive estate: Sir Roger Norrington and his wife bought Nalder Hill House, which has seven bedrooms, as well as four one-bedroom flats and three cottages, 17 years ago

‘Buying this property was a family venture,’ he says. ‘Now there are fewer of us, the place is too big – it’s like a snail’s shell stuck to my back.’

Sir Roger and his choreographer wife Kay, 61, bought Nalder Hill House 17 years ago. It was big enough to enable them to install Kay’s mother and stepfather in one of three cottages in the grounds and make a steady income from letting the four one-bedroom flats attached to the house. However, what attracted them to the property most was its potential as a restoration project.

Nalder Hill was then a rather sad and gloomy hotel, but Sir Roger saw the chance to transpose his musical beliefs into interior design.

‘Follow the exact instructions of Beethoven in 1810 and the music somehow sounds modern,’ says Sir Roger, whose musical trademark is performing classical works exactly  as they would have sounded when written. ‘Similarly with a house – just show up what was originally there and it lives again.’

The couple had previously restored a 17th Century cottage in nearby  Inkpen. However, Nalder Hill, with its Fawlty-esque odour of failure, had been more thoughtlessly fouled up.

Big project: Sir Roger has spent a majority of the time living at Nalder Hill renovating the Victorian gem

Standing in the magnificent drawing room, with its views over the Kennet valley, Kay points out the minuscule attention to detail they have brought to the restoration.

Every plastic light switch has been taken out and replaced with Victorian brass fittings; Victorian bell pushes are now in place; the fireplaces, one in every room, have been restored; faded wallpaper has been replaced with silk fabric inserts between panelling; cornicing has been freshly coloured with gold leaf.

That is quite apart from the major structural repairs – the rewiring, new roofing, replumbing and new copper gutters. It all took 15 years, and when I enquire about the price of the works, Sir Roger replies simply: ‘Don’t ask!’

The drawing room opens into the dining room and along the corridor there is Sir Roger’s study, with its baby grand piano, floor-to-ceiling bookcases and imposing desk.

It’s only when you see upstairs – where, apart from the four flats, there are seven bedrooms with dressing rooms and bathrooms – that you truly appreciate the size of this house.

Did Sir Roger regret, I wonder, taking time out a few years ago to appear on Maestro, a television series involving eight celebrities, including Jane Asher, Katie Derham, Peter Snow and David Soul, competing against one another to find the best conductor?

Veteran in the game: Sir Roger Norrington has been conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Last Night of the Proms for three decades

 ‘No – I loved it,’ he says. ‘A lot of people learned a lot from it about classical music. The winner, Sue Perkins, was extremely good.’He is remarkably unstuffy, and any talk about conducting is infused with self-deprecation.

‘The great conductors – and I don’t consider myself one – have supernatural powers,’ he says. ‘I just use my eyes and gestures and shout, “Play in tune, you b******s!” ’

It’s little wonder that Sir Roger is regarded with such affection by orchestras. His warmest memories of Nalder Hill are  of the times when the entire Stuttgart Orchestra – 100 musicians – visited for lunch parties in his five acres of grounds.

‘Orchestras don’t usually socialise with their conductor, which is silly,’ he says. ‘They have come three times and each time was marvellous. We have a hog roast and a jazz band plays.’

Much of the countryside surrounding the house is shown in a gigantic mural in the hallway, covering three walls. One direction looks towards Oxford and the spires of the university city are exaggerated so as to stand out.

The artist the Norringtons commissioned to create the mural even included a tiny depiction of Sir Roger in a boat on the River Cherwell.

The death of Kay’s mother and her stepfather’s move into a care home  led to the sale.

But who will buy it? ‘Maybe some international businessman or rich rock star,’ says Kay. ‘It’s handy for London and the airports and big enough for an entourage, staff and an extended family.’
