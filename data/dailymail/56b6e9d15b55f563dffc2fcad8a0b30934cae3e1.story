His energy and enthusiasm would put presenters half his age to shame.

But after nearly a decade of hosting Strictly Come Dancing, it seems Sir Bruce Forsyth is finally beginning to feel the weight of his 84 years.

For the first time, the entertainer will take a holiday mid-series to recuperate from the strain of hosting the Saturday night shows.

He seemed to struggle once or twice with the timing of his jokes on this weekend’s programme, but still happily warmed up the 500-strong audience beforehand with a combination of gags and song routines.

Break: Sir Bruce Forsyth, pictured with Strictly co-host Tess Daly, will take a holiday mid-series

Off-stage, a crew  member was on hand to guide him past the judges’ podium to make sure he did not trip over a set of steps.

More than 9.9million tuned in to watch on Saturday, with Jerry Hall putting in a poor performance that saw her booted out of the competition in last night’s result show.

Strictly easily beat its ITV rival the Factor, which was watched by only 8.2million.

Sir Bruce negotiated the week-long break with producers before filming on the tenth series began in September.

He will miss one show, on November 10, so he can rest before the following week’s live episode at Wembley Arena.

His co-presenter Tess Daly will stand in as host, with her usual role taken by Claudia Winkleman.

It will be the first time Sir Bruce, last month named as the longest-serving male TV entertainer by Guinness World Records, has voluntarily missed a show.

Three years ago, doctors ordered him to pull out of one episode when he contracted flu.

Yesterday, a Strictly spokesman said: ‘Even national treasures are allowed to take a week off.

Sir
 Bruce is taking a short break so he can be on top form and fighting fit
 for the Children in Need show at Wembley the following week.

Since this article was published, it has been brought to our attention that the mid-series break which Sir Bruce is taking was planned well in advance and was not arranged to allow him to take a rest from the show.

Busy schedule: Despite reportedly  feeling the strain, Bruce was on the mic as he attended the Arora Ball at the Sofitel Hotel at London's Heathrow Airport over the weekend, alongside Lord Jeffrey Archer

It turns out years of cycling is rather good preparation for a Strictly wardrobe malfunction. Victoria
