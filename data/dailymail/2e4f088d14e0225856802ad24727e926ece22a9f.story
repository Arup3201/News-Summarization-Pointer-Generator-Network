Victor Valdes was at Old Trafford to watch Manchester United take on Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.

The former Barcelona goalkeeper is training with United in a bid to improve his fitness after recovering from a long-term knee injury.

Valdes, who is a free agent, has held talks with Louis van Gaal over the possibility of moving to Old Trafford.

Valdes' agent Gines Carvajal and another representative have met the United hierarchy as Van Gaal is looking to wrap up a deal in the next fortnight.

The 32-year-old's knee injury is currently being assessed by the Premier League club's staff before any move is completed.

He was originally on the verge of a deal with United's North West rivals Liverpool, but had a pick of clubs including Bayern Munich before choosing a move to Old Trafford.

With Anders Lindegaard not inspiring Van Gaal's confidence, the Dutch boss has been on the lookout for a second-choice keeper. 

Here's what Victor Valdes could look like in a Manchester United shirt if he signed for the club
