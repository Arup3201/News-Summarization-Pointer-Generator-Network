Claims: Nigel Farage has been accused of preventing debate over UKIP's use of expenses money 

UKIP today faces new claims that it has blocked questions about its EU expenses, a day after it emerged that Nigel Farage was paid £15,500 a year to run his office.  

Party insiders said that the UKIP leader had tried to stop other officials from raising concerns about how allowances and donations were being spent.  

Mr Farage allegedly told one party worker to 'shut up' after she questioned the expenses claimed by UKIP's MEPs.

He has denied any wrongdoing after it was claimed that the European Parliament paid him more than £75,000 in office allowances every year even though he spent just £3,000 a year on his constituency office.  

He claimed that the allegations reported by The Times were a 'political smear' and insisted he had not spent any expenses improperly.  

Mr Farage has been outspoken in opposing the abuse of expenses by MPs, and last week called for Maria Miller to resign from the Cabinet after she was found to have claimed too much money.

However, former UKIP executive Delroy Young claimed that the party leader had previously refused to discuss how expenses and donations were handled.  

He said that Mr Farage went 'berserk' when confronted with questions from an official about EU expenses and the money raised by donations to a call centre in Kent.  

'Farage shouted at her, he said, "Shut up you stupid woman." He went berserk,' Mr Young told The Times.  

Ian Gillman, who formerly sat on UKIP's governing body, said that he was threatened by an official when he raised concerns about the way the party spent its money. 

'I never raised my voice, I just persisted with question after question about where our money had gone,' he said. 'The official made threats to take me outside the room and beat me up.'  

Bruce Lawson, the party's ex-treasurer, apparently wrote to Mr Farage in 2008 calling him for him to resign as leader and expressed worries about MEPs' expenses.  

He claimed that some MEPs were given £660 a month directly into their pension funds, adding: 'In theory they are then supposed to reimburse this money from their salaries, but everyone relies on the MEPs' honesty. There are no checks that any of them actually do repay this money.'  

Controversy: Mr Farage claims £15,500 a year to run his constituency office in West Sussex, pictured 

Mr Farage acted angrily yesterday after he was accused of being paid more money than he needed to run his constituency office in West Sussex, which was donated rent-free by supporters.  

The former manager of the office estimated that the building's insurance and council tax cost £150 per month with £100 spent on utilities, bringing the total running cost to £3,000 a year.  

However, Mr Farage was paid £15,500 a year from the European Parliament's 'general expenditure allowance' - leaving £60,000 unaccounted for since the last European elections in 2009.  

He told Sky News: 'They are not expenses. We don't actually claim for anything. I have not claimed for an office, I have not claimed this figure of £15,000.'  

Asked what the money was spent on, Mr Farage said: 'The electricity bill is more than £3,000 a year, we have burglar alarms, we have insurance, we have a massive postbag and a mail bill that is growing by the week as the level of interest and support for our party and our campaign and our cause grows.'

Accusation: Former UKIP officials claim that the party is not transparent with its finances

Writing in the Independent today, he added: 'It is not for me to defend this system: after all, I want it abolished.  

'Ever since 1999, I have expressly stated that UKIP MEPs will use the wherewithal provided by the EU Parliament to campaign for Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.'  

Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies called for Mr Farage to spell out exactly how he spent his parliamentary allowances.  

'I have always ensured that money paid to me for office costs has been used for that purpose,' he told The Times. 'Mr Farage should be able to produce the same evidence if he wants to claim to be different.'  

MEPs are paid €95,482 (£78,800) a year, and also receive a daily attendance allowance as well as money for staff costs.
