More eyewitnesses have come forward in the shooting of Michael Brown and backed up previous claims that the teenager did nothing wrong in the moments before a police officer killed him.

Tiffany Mitchell, who watched the shooting unfold, told CNN on Wednesday that the police's version of events - that Brown assaulted the officer and tried to grab his gun - was not true.

Brown did not enter the police vehicle, as authorities have claimed, but there appeared to be a struggle at the window, Ms Mitchell said.

Ms Mitchell recorded video of the aftermath of the shooting which included the horrifying moment that a man, believed to be Michael Brown's uncle, rushed up to the teenager's lifeless body

A police officer rushed  to push the man back from the body of 18-year-old unarmed Michael Brown following the police shooting on Saturday

'It looked as if Michael was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in,' she told CNN.

'The cop shot a fire through the window. Michael breaks away and starts running away but the officer continued shooting.' 

Ms Mitchell had gone to the Ferguson, Missouri neighborhood on Saturday to pick up an employee, Piaget Crenshaw, for work. 

Ms Crenshaw, who lives in an apartment with a balcony overlooking the street, also witnessed the incident.

Before the shooting, it appeared that the 18-year-old and police officer were 'arm-wrestling', she told CNN.

Both women said that a shot was fired and that Brown started running away from the officer and the patrol vehicle.   

They said that the officer chased the teen roughly 20 feet down the street and fired shots at him  in the St Louis suburb.

The 18-year-old turned and raised his hands in the air, the witnesses said, but the shots kept coming. 

In the chaotic aftermath of the attack, news of the shooting spread quickly. 

On cellphone footage shot by Ms Mitchell, a man believed to be Michael Brown's uncle approached the body to see if it is his nephew.A police officer rushed up to the man and pushed him back.

Ms Mitchell and Ms Crenshaw have given statements to St Louis County police who are handling the investigation. 

The reports from the two women appeared to confirm an earlier eye-witness account from Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who was walking with the teenager when police approached them.

Mr Johnson, 22, said that he and Brown were walking home from a store when the cop told them to get out of the street and 'get the f***' on to the sidewalk'.

Johnson said they kept walking after explaining to the officer they were almost home. The officer then pulled his truck in front of them and blocked the road, Johnson said. 

The officer threw open the door which slammed closed again after bouncing off Brown, the friend said. It was then that the officer grabbed his friend by the neck.

Mr Johnson told MSNBC on Tuesday: 'The time frame was 60 seconds or less, it got out of hand really quickly.'

He said that the officer had drawn his gun by this time and threatened to shoot Michael.

'I seen the fire come out of the barrel,' he told the network. 'I could see so vividly what was going on because I was so close.'

Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away but he could already see that the teenager had blood coming down his shirt where he had been shot. 

The 22-year-old ducked behind a car but Brown kept running. 

'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Johnson said.  

The 22-year-old said: '[Brown] stopped, turned with his hands up and said ''I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!''

'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.' 

The body of Michael Brown lies in a Ferguson street on Saturday. The unarmed teenager's death, at the hands of a police officer, has sparked riots in the quiet suburban neighborhood 

The eye-witness said despite the teenager's protests, the officer shot again, hitting Brown and leaving him on the ground. 

Mr Johnson told the TV station that he ran in terror to his apartment and vomited, before checking he had not been shot. He came out from his apartment to see his friend lying dead in the middle of the street.

'We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,' Johnson added. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

The 22-year-old spoke to MSNBC on Tuesday alongside his attorney and former St Louis' mayor, Freeman Bosley Jr. 

The lawyer said on Tuesday that he had offered police the opportunity to interview his client about Saturday's tragic events but they initially declined. Mr Johnson was finally interviewed by the police on Wednesday. 

Police have offered a different version of events of the altercation which led to the fatal shooting on Saturday. 

Authorities said that while the officer was exiting his car, he was physically assaulted by Brown and there was a struggle over the cop's weapon.

Police do not dispute that the officer shot the subject multiple times and that the deceased was not armed. 

Ferguson police said on Tuesday that they would not be releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting because of death threats on social media.  

Brown's shooting has sparked riots in the streets of suburban Ferguson, Missouri, where 70 per cent of the population is African-American but in a 53-strong police force there are only three black officers.

Riot police deployed tear gas and bean-bag rounds on Monday night to disperse an agitated crowd.

Mr Johnson said that he was still in shock over his friend's death and how quickly the situation escalated.

He described the 18-year-old, who was due to start technical college on Monday, as 'a quiet, kind and gentle' person.
