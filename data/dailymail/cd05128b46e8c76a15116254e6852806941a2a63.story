Charlie Austin has given QPR a huge lift as it emerged that he will miss only one game after scans showed he has escaped with severe bruising on his injured right foot.

There had been fears that Austin, who has scored 13 Premier League goals, would be out for the season after leaving Loftus Road in a protective boot on Saturday.

The Rangers forward will miss the trip to Sunderland on Tuesday but he is expected to return against Hull City on February 22.

However, Rangers are likely to be mising Richard Dunne for the rest of the season with a knee injury

Rangers will be without central defender Richard Dunne for the rest of the season after he damaged medial ligaments in his right knee during Saturday’s loss to Southampton.

Seven of the past 10 meetings between these two sides have resulted in away wins.

Dunne was forced off with the injury in the 83rd minute against Ronald Koeman’s side and scans confirmed on Sunday that he will need an operation.

Nedum Onuoha, who played as a makeshift right back against high-flying Saints, is another injury concern after damaging his hamstring.

Coaches Chris Ramsey and Kevin Bond will prepare the team for Tuesday’s trip to the Stadium of Light, but Tim Sherwood is still expected to be named QPR manager.

The former Spurs boss has been out of work since he was sacked by Daniel Levy last May and he faces a massive challenge to keep Rangers in the Premier League.

Ramsey, who worked with Sherwood at Spurs, admitted the pair talk most days, but continues to insist that they have yet to discuss the size of the task at Loftus Road.

The QPR coach said: ‘I’ll be speaking to him, but we’ll talk about football and loads of other things. We’ll probably have a chat about the game, but it’s no different from other people having a chat about the game.’

Former manager Harry Redknapp thinks Sherwood will get the job. ‘There’s every chance,’ he said. ‘It’s pretty much set up for Tim.’

Rangers are in desperate trouble after five successive defeats and it will take some re-organising to keep this team in the top flight.

Following Harry Redknapp's resignation, Tim Sherwood has emerged as the front-runner for the QPR job 

They were beaten when Saido Mane scored for Saints in the 93rd minute to keep their dream of finishing in the top four and qualifying for the Champions League alive.

Saints manager Ronald Koeman said: ‘Last season it was Everton who were fighting for that position, now it looks like we will.

‘That’s good because it makes a change and it’s good for the rest of the clubs.

‘They have the best players and they buy the best, so it’s difficult, but we have to fight to the end of the season. That’s the challenge.’
