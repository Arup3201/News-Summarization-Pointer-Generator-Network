A man has been caught on camera using his iPad to take photos up a woman’s skirt as he bends down to pat her dog.

Fashion model Brittanie Weaver realised that a man, who followed her around pet shop Puppy and Me in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, was actually taking pictures up her dress while he pretended to be interested in her pet.

When her suspicions were raised about the customer, she tried to write a note to the women at the shop counter before she alerted police of the suspected peeping Tom. They have since released security footage of the incident in an attempt to find him.
