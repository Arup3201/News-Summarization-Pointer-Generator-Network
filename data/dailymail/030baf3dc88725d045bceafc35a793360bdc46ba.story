It was the picture-perfect holiday island, blighted by the tragedy of the Costa Concordia shipwreck.

But now romance has returned to the Mediterranean isle of Giglio- with many of the salvage workers striking up relationships with local girls- causing residents to rename their home ‘Love Island’.

And as the giant cruise liner prepares to leave Giglio forever, one British ‘wrecker’ and the local beauty he fell for, are expecting a baby set to heal the wounds of the tragic isle.

Picture perfect: After meeting him while he was working to salvage the Costa Concordia, Virginia D'Elia, 22, has followed handsome welder Simon Jackson, 36, back to his home in Kent

Virginia D'Elia, 22, has followed handsome welder Simon Jackson, 36, back to his home in Kent and is set to give birth to his baby boy, in mid August.

The baby will be named Filippo, after his grandfather, who lived on Giglio and died around the time of the shipwreck.

Relatives on the island say it is 'wonderful' that something good has emerged from tragedy.

Meanwhile other local girls are preparing to say goodbye to their salvage worker lovers today, as they will depart along with the ship tomorrow.

For the past two years, the older 
residents of Giglio say, there has been an almost wartime atmosphere on 
the island, as some 2000, predominantly male, salvage workers moved in, 
with money to spend and testosterone galore.

Romance: Virginia and Simon are now expecting a baby boy in mid-August. The baby will be named Filippo after Virginia's grandfather who lived on Giglio and died around the time of the shipwreck

Brooding: The operation to prepare the Costa Concordia to be towed away from the island of Giglio were hampered by heavy rain this morning

Simon’s boss on the island, South African salvage master Nick Sloane, now a national hero in Italy, is renowned for his lewd jokes and for taking nude showers in the garden of his villa every day.

The island has only a permanent population of 800 in winter so local girls had their pick of the uniformed muscular foreigners.

Virginia’s aunt, Liliana Fanciulli, who owns the hotel on Giglio where her niece was working when she met Simon, said: ‘ The baby is due in mid August. It is a boy-they are going to call him Filippo. ‘

‘They are so in love -they are a beautiful couple. There are no plans to marry at the moment but he is a great guy, she loves him and now they are having a baby together. That is enough.’

‘The family are very happy. It’s wonderful that this has happened, that something good has come out of this tragedy. It helps you go on.’

Happy: Virginia's relatives on the island say it is 'wonderful' that something good has finally emerged from the Costa Concordia tragedy

Simon, a salvage expert who runs a family welding business in Sussex, was her niece’s first serious boyfriend, she said.

The pair met in a bar and soon began taking romantic walks around the island together. At first they could barely communicate as she spoke only a little English and he only broken Italian.

When Simon was not on shift they would go out with friends and his colleagues to the nightspots in the port.

On the night of the parbuckling operation last September, in which the ship was wrested from the rocks in an unprecedented engineering coup, the couple were seen clinging to each other with emotion, before Simon had to board the wreck in a dangerous mission.

Soon after, mission accomplished, the couple moved to the UK where Virginia began an English course.

A group of tourists have their picture taken in front of the wreck of the Costa Concordia as it is re-floated. The cruise liner is expected to be towed away from Giglio tomorrow

She quickly became pregnant. The pair have since been back twice to visit relatives but decided not to visit for the removal of the ship given Virginia is due in a few weeks.

But the other couples will be soon saying their goodbyes. One of Simon’s former colleagues at salvage company Titan said: ‘We will be sad to go. There have been at tens if not dozens of romances, not all of them serious of course. All the single lads have had a local girlfriend pretty much.'

Donatella Botti, a friend of Virginia’s, who runs a local bar in the town of Castello, said : ‘All over Giglio the girls are weeping today because the salvage workers are leaving.

‘Here on this island we know every single person by name. So they have become part of our family. They have changed our lives.

‘We don’t want them to leave. That night of the wreck was a tragedy but it changed all our lives forever. ‘
