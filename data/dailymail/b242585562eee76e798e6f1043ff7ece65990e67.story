An ancient bright blue pigment first used 5,000 years ago is giving modern scientists clues toward the development of new nanomaterials that could be the basis for futuristic gadgets.

Egyptian blue, one of the first pigments known to man, has potential uses in state-of-the-art medical imaging devices, television remote controls and other telecommunications technology, new research claims.

Regarded as humanity's first synthetic pigment, it was used in paintings on tombs, statues, papyrii and other objects throughout the ancient Mediterranean world.

Considered humanity's first synthetic pigment, Egyptian blue was used by the Egyptians for thousands of years.

The term for it in the Egyptian language is hsbd-iryt, which means artificial lapis lazuli, revealing the ancients obsession with the precious stone, which they prized for its rarity and stark blue colour.

Its characteristic blue colour, resulting from one of its main components — copper — ranges from a light to a dark hue, depending on differential processing and composition.

The earliest evidence for the use of Egyptian blue is in the Fourth Dynasty (c.2575-2467 BC) and in the Middle Kingdom (2050-1652 BC), it continued to be in the decoration of tombs, wall paintings, furnishings and statues

By the New Kingdom (1570–1070 BC), Egyptian blue began to be more widely used in the production of numerous objects.

The pigment was known to the Romans by the name caeruleum. Vitruvius describes in his work De architectura how it was produced by grinding sand, copper and natron and heating the mixture, shaped into small balls, in a furnace.

Lime is necessary for the production as well, but probably lime-rich sand was used.

After the Roman era, Egyptian Blue fell from usage and the manner of its creation was forgotten.

However, after the end of the Roman era, Egyptian blue fell into disuse and the secrets of its creation were forgotten.

But
 now researchers from the University of Georgia have found that Egyptian
 blue can be rolled into nanosheets so thin that thousands would fit 
across the width of a human hair.

Not
 only that, but the sheets produce invisible infra-red radiation similar
 to the beams that communicate between remote controls and TVs, car door
 locks and other telecommunications devices.

Known to chemists as calcium copper silicate, remnants of Egyptian blue been found on the Parthenon's statue of the messenger goddess Iris and in the famous Pond in a Garden fresco in the tomb of Egyptian 'scribe and counter of grain' Nebamun in Thebes, amongst other places.

The ancient Egyptians held the colour blue in very high regard and were eager to present it on many media and in a variety of forms.

The earliest evidence for the use of Egyptian blue is in the Fourth Dynasty (c.2575-2467 BC). It appears on limestone sculptures from that period, as well as being shaped into a variety of cylinder seals and beads.

In the Middle Kingdom (2050-1652 BC), it continued to be used as a pigment in the decoration of tombs, wall paintings, furnishings and statues and by the New Kingdom (1570–1070 BC), began to be more widely used in the production of numerous objects.

The Romans knew it by the name caeruleum, and Vitruvius describes in his work De Architectura how it was produced by grinding sand, copper and natron and heating the mixture, shaped into small balls, in a furnace.

Apart from Egypt, it has also been found in the Near East, the Eastern Mediterranean and at the limits of the Roman Empire.

Although undoubtedly an Egyptian invention, it is unclear as to whether its existence elsewhere was a result of parallel inventions or whether its technology had spread to these areas.

Its use continued throughout the Late period, and Greco-Roman period, only dying out in the fourth century AD, when the secret to its manufacture was lost.

It was only at the beginning of the 19th century that there was a renewed interest in learning more about its manufacture when it was investigated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1815 and others such as W. T. Russell and F. Fouqué.

Now
 thanks to the discovery of its remarkable properties, Egyptian blue 
could be due a renaissance as part of the latest generation of high-tech
 nano-engineered devices.

Tina
 Salguero, assistant professor of chemistry at Georgia, and her 
colleagues detailed their findings in an article on the pigment 
published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

They
 wrote: 'Calcium copper silicate provides a route to a new class of 
nanomaterials that are particularly interesting with respect to 
state-of-the-art pursuits like near-IR-based biomedical imaging, IR 
light-emitting devices (especially telecommunication platforms) and 
security ink formulations.

'In this way we can re-imagine the applications of an ancient material through modern technochemical means.'
