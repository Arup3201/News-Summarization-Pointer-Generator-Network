The North Korean regime plied Dennis Rodman with an endless supply of liquor on his controversial tour of the secretive dictatorship that led to his latest stint in rehab, a friend on the trip told MailOnline today.

Waiters circled the former NBA star and his teammates so that ‘when their cups were empty they would fill them up’ said Vin Baker, who was one of the players.

Baker, who has overcome his own battle with booze and is now a church minister, said the alcohol consumption was ‘excessive’ and ‘difficult to watch’.

Excessive: Baker, sitting to right of Rodman in spectacles, said the group were served an endless stream of hard liqour. He said Rodman's drinking was the 8,000lbs gorilla in the room'

He told MailOnline that even in all his years of alcohol abuse he had ‘never seen it like that’.

Rodman has now gone into a 30-day drink rehab program. He has also apologized to the family of Kenneth Bae, the American who is being held captive by North Korea, for suggesting in an hysterical interview that he was a guilty man. Rodman claims he was drunk at the time he spoke to CNN.

Baker, who blew $100m during his basketball career but has been sober for nearly three years, said that during the trip Rodman asked him four or five times how he got clean.

Baker said: ‘He wasn’t just asking about how I got clean for the sake of asking how I got clean. I think the negative attention (on the trip) really broke through.

'I don’t think the liquor was enough to make the pain and embarrassment go away’.

Baker said that while staying in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, they had no nightlife and only one chance to leave the hotel outside of games and training, which was for an excursion to a water park.

Help: Dennis Rodman sought treatment after his controversial CNN interview during his North Korea visit

Cooped up for days on end there was nothing to do apart from order endless rounds of room service or hit the hotel bar - something which Baker did not do.

during hi stay he was even presented with bespoke bottles of vodka, decorated with hand-drawn illustrations of Rodman and the dictator.

He described Rodman’s drinking problem as ‘the 8,000lbs gorilla in the room’ which would have been obvious to everyone.

Baker said: ‘It was very difficult to watch, Dennis in particular. I prayed for him. When their cups were empty our hosts would fill it up. I don’t know if it was the culture. It was very difficult to watch.

‘I know they wanted to make him happy. I’ve never seen it at that level when they keep bringing it back to back. It was excessive.’

Baker, 42, added that he was ‘ecstatic’ that Rodman had sought help and that it was ‘going to be a chapter in his life that is amazing’.

He said: ‘I’m happy that he’s made this decision to get help. I think Dennis has a lot of things to offer but you have to be in a sober place’.

Baker said that when Rodman asked him why he quit drinking he said:  ‘Honestly Dennis, I was going to die if I didn’t change my behavior’.

Baker said: ‘I was honest with him. I was just listening to him. He did not really comment. The fact he asked me three or four times led me to know there was something that he wanted to change.’

Rodman was joined in North Korea by seven ex-NBA stars who were there to train the country’s basketball team and play an exhibition game in front of Kim, on his birthday, which they lost.

Among the men was ex-New York Knicks power forward Charles Smith. A woman who answered the phone at his home in Montclair, New Jersey said that he was not doing any more interviews.

Baker’s interview gives an insight into the methods used by the North Koreans to keep Rodman on message during his trip.

Friends: North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un with Dennis Rodman in January

And during his month-long stay at an undisclosed rehab facility in New Jersey, he will certainly have time to reflect on a trip that controversial from the start.

It was Rodman’s third visit to North Korea and during his stay the ex-Chicago Bulls star, 52, called the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un his ‘best friend’ and in a bizarre episode sang him happy birthday whilst on the basketball court.

But critics said that his brand of ‘basketball diplomacy’ as he put it was doing more damage than good and Mr Bae’s family said his comments were ‘outrageous’.

Drinking seems to be a regular feature of Kim’s life and he was supposedly drunk when he ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek.

Kim reportedly likes expensive tequila and regularly downs cocktails at all hours. His father Kim Jong-il was supposedly fond of $600 a bottle Hennessy Cognac and spent $700,000 a year on the drink.

Rodman, who has been in rehab twice before, will also be reflecting on Baker’s advice, as it comes from a man who has walked in his shoes.

Selected by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1993 NBA draft, Baker’s career took off and in 1999 he signed a seven-year, $86.6 million contract with the Seattle SuperSonics.

Three years later he was traded to the Boston Celtics but could not get his drinking under control and would turn up to practice reeking of booze.

Boredom: Baker says the group were largely confined to their hotel so the drink flowed freely

He was still earning around $13 million a year but admitted to being an alcoholic and his weight ballooned to more than 300lbs.

Baker, once an NBA Allstar, was released and bounced around the league before retiring in 2006.

He has nothing to show for his riches but is now a minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem in New York where he helps with the youth basketball programme.

In a statement Rodman’s agent Darren Prince has said that while in North Korea his drinking had ‘escalated to a level that none of us had seen before’.

He said in a statement: ‘Dennis Rodman came back from North Korea in pretty rough shape emotionally.

‘The pressure that was put on him to be a combination 'super human' political figure and 'fixer' got the better of him.

‘He is embarrassed, saddened and remorseful for the anger and hurt his words have caused.’

Mr Prince did not return calls for comment.

Reached by MailOnline at her Desoto, Texas home, Rodman’s mother Shirley said: ‘If he’s going to rehab then good for him’.
