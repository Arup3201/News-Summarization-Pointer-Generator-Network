A 16-year-old boy accused of strangling his adoptive parents and hiding their bodies in the family car is to be tried as an adult, a judge has ruled.

Karate black belt Moses Kamin allegedly admitted to killing his parents - Robert Kamin, 55, and Susan Poff , 50, after officers discovered their bodies in Oakland, California.

Judge Morris Jacobson of Alameda County Superior Court has ruled their is enough evidence to hold the teenager - who was 15 at the time of his parents' deaths in January - over for trial.

Brutal: Robert Kamin, right, and Susan Poff, left, were allegedly murdered by their adopted 15-year-old son Moses at their home in Oakland, California

The youngster is being held without bail and is scheduled to return to court on October 3, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

Moses Kamin, of Oakland, California, entered a not guilty plea in Alameda County Superior Court earlier this year.

Prosecutors say he confessed to killing his parents.

He apparently admitted strangling his mother first with his hands and then some type of ligature during the argument.

When Mr Kamin came home later that evening, the teen came up behind him and strangled him as well, prosecutors claim.

The coupleâ€™s bodies were found hidden under blankets in the back of the family's car parked outside their house near Lake Merritt, which investigators believe Kamin had tried unsuccessfully to set ablaze.

The bodies of Susan Poff and Robert Kamin were found in the family's car outside their home in Oakland, California

Police went to the Kamin house after their employers reported they did not show up for work. They were both civil servants.

Kamin was arrested for their murder 
after police discovered the couple's bodies in the car - and held at the
Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center in San Leandro.

A videotape of the boy's statement to police was played during his preliminary hearing,' reports the Chronicle.

His attorney, Assistant Public Defender Drew Steckler, tried 
unsuccessfully to have the judge throw out the videotaped statement on 
the grounds that his client did not understand his legal rights, according to the newspaper.

Mr Steckler is reported to be planning to appeal that decision and to have the case 
transferred to Juvenile Court.

Argument: Apparently Susan Poff and Robert Kamin had argued with their teenage son about how much time he was spending at the Occupy Oakland camp

Following his arrest, colleagues of the couple told the San Francisco Chronicle that the couple had been having problems with their son, who they believed was spending too much time in the Occupy Oakland camp.

Occupy Oakland is allied with New York City's Occupy Wall Street and other protests like Occupy San Francisco and Occupy San Jose.

Co-workers mourned the well-known couple after news of their murders became public. Mrs Poff's boss called her death 'a terrible loss'.

Joshua Bamberger told the Oakland Tribune: 'I've never met anyone who lived with as little ambivalence about making the world a better place.'

Mrs Poff, who attended UC Berkley, and Mr Kamin, a graduate of Stanford University, met through friends.

The couple adopted in 2002 because they were unable to have their own children, Robert Kamin's brother Bruce told the Chronicle.

They had recently moved to the area and were in the middle of renovating their house.
