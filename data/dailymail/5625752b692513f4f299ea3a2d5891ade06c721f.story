Andy Gray, recognised as the best football co-commentator in TV sport, will make a dramatic return to the English game on Saturday.

Gray is back in the gantry alongside Ian Darke at the unlikely location of Stevenage’s Broadhall Way working for BT Sport on their live FA Cup coverage of the League One side’s fourth-round game against Everton.

Former Everton striker Gray has not been heard on a football commentary produced by a British TV station since leaving Sky in 2011 after the controversy over his sexist comments off camera about assistant referee Sian Massey.

Comeback: Andy Gray was widely renowned as the best commentator in the game before his Sky sacking

The future: Together with Richard Keys he built up an aura, and he may now return - this time on BT Sport

Since then he has worked alongside his former Sky colleague Richard Keys for talksport radio and for beIN Sports based in Doha.

The
 fact beIN Sports have agreed to Gray working for BT Sport, even on a 
one-off basis, opens up some intriguing possibilities over future shared
 football ambitions.

It
 will cause huge concern for Sky if beIN Sports and BT join forces for 
the next Premier League rights auction.

A BT spokesman said: ‘We are 
delighted Andy can stand in for Michael Owen, who is overseas.’

Shock: Gray pictured shortly after leaving Sky

New ventures: Gray and Keys have sinced worked with talkSPORT, amongst others

Andy Hunt, former chief executive of the British Olympic Association whose flag-waving celebrity obsession during the Olympics was mocked by parody Twitter account Randy Shunt, has had his own postings on social media curtailed.

Hunt had kept the Team GB association on his own Twitter account despite leaving the BOA a year ago. But the BOA have now belatedly put a stop to that following complaints.

Chelsea's Eden Hazard, shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or that went to Cristiano Ronaldo, posted an Instagram of himself with a ‘Ballon de Bois’ trophy signed by all the Chelsea team.

The wooden replica of the Ballon d’Or had been sent in by a Chelsea fan in Romania for the players to sign and Hazard saw the dressing-room photo opportunity.

However, credit Chelsea for meeting supporters’ requests for autographs.

Hoax: Eden Hazards' 'Ballon de Bois' was actually a present from a Romanian Chelsea fan

One remarkable feature of Manchester City’s assault on four trophies has been the unlikely harmony from boardroom to bootroom at a club that had previously been a byword for turmoil.

Insiders believe the departure of Roberto Mancini, Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli — around whom a lot of the madness had revolved — has had a lot to do with the newfound calm.

The club’s unity was displayed on Friday when manager Manuel Pellegrini, captain Vincent Kompany and football development executive Patrick Vieira all attended the relaunch of City’s women’s team for the FA Super League.

Roy shootout shrink?

The woeful penalty shoot-out efforts by England players this week will add to the scrutiny of the FA’s new performance services chief Dave Reddin, whose views on the psychology of taking penalties will be crucial in the build-up to the World Cup.

England have gone out of major tournaments on penalties six times in the last 24 years and the spot-kicks by Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones and Adam Johnson in Manchester United’s Capital One Cup loss to Sunderland only underlined the problem.

It will be Reddin’s call whether England need to take a sports psychologist to Brazil, with manager Roy Hodgson saying he is ‘interested to hear what Dave has to say about it’. And England don’t have a great track record in that area. 

Bill Beswick didn’t do much during Steve McClaren brief tenure, and Glenn Hoddle’s ludicrous faith-healer Eileen Drewery was a joke figure among the players.

Will he, won't he? Roy Hodgson is considering hiring a shrink to help players in penalty shootouts

Blunders: Danny Welbeck (above) and Phil Jones (below) both missed penalties for Manchester United on Wednesday, not boding well for England at the World Cup...

Sports management agency Paragon are having to deal with media division chief Claire Burns setting up her own business and taking racing clients Tony McCoy and Emma Spencer with her.

Paragon also have the problem of Clydesdale Bank withdrawing from cricket. Paragon negotiated a five-year deal, under which Clydesdale’s name appears on Alastair Cook’s bat, that goes through to 2017.
