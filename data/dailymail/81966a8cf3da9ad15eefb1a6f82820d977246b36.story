A cross-eyed arsonist who set fire to
 a shop and post office during the August riots has been jailed for 
eight years, after police spotted his unusual eyes on CCTV.

Andrew Burls, 23, started blazes at 
Regen's Lingerie boutique in Rye Lane, Peckham, south London, which spread through neighbouring Greggs bakery and a post
 office in the same street, during riots that spread across the capital 
last year.

The damage cost more than £1 million and left six people homeless.

Cross-eyed giveaway: Officers combed through hours of CCTV footage and spotted Andrew Burls, of Peckham, because of his distinctive crossed eyes

Despite covering his face with a bandana, officers 
combed through hours of CCTV footage and spotted Burls, of Peckham, 
because of his distinctive crossed eyes.

The 23-year-old originally denied the 
offence, but was jailed for a total of eight years at Inner London Crown
 Court today after pleading guilty on January 30 to two counts of arson 
being reckless as to whether life was endangered, and one of burglary 
with intent to steal at Iceland in Rye Lane, a court official confirmed.

Burls blinked as he heard his fate and glanced up at the packed public gallery before running down the stairs to the cells.

Tom Forster, prosecuting, told Judge 
Roger Chapple at Inner London Crown Court: ‘What's important about that 
image is that his eyes appear distinctive in that they appear to look in
 different directions.

‘If My Lord was to compare that with a 
photograph of Mr Burls himself when he was arrested, My Lord can see the
 distinctive eyes, and the direction in which they point in the 
photograph.’

Judge Chapple told the defendant, who
 was wearing two plastic crucifixes over a grey sweatshirt: ‘When you 
add fire to an already appalling situation you add a while new and 
altogether terrifying dimension.

‘The effects of fire can so easily be as they are here, devastating.

‘It is not an accident that the maximum sentence for simple arson is life-imprisonment.

‘Extensive damage was caused to the Post Office, Regen’s and Greggs next door.

‘You plainly didn’t care about the effect of your actions whatsoever.

‘You caused terror to those who had to leave their homes because of the fires you started.

‘Those people felt trapped on that back terrace, watching their homes going up in smoke or flames.’

Anarchy: Peckham looters smash windows and take clothing

Burls’ rampage began at Iceland at 
around 6.30pm, moving on to the Post Office and Regen’s, and he was seen
 with surging looters in Maestro Records.

In footage from Iceland Burls can be 
seen approaching the shop and pulling the pane of glass from the window 
before going in followed by a surge of looters.

The supervisor and staff were in the 
shop and locked themselves in a back office, where they watched on CCTV 
the masked mob throwing bricks at the building. The manager estimated losses of £1,400.

The throng of looters flowed down Rye
 Lane, and Burls stopped outside Maestro, where he was identified 
sitting on a vehicle bonnet in Rye Lane.

Then he is seen in Money Shop at around 6.55pm, leaving seven minutes later for the Post Office.

Footage from there show the door had 
been forced open and Burls returning with burning material, which he 
used to start a fire on the floor which he feeds with leaflets and other
 papers.

Acting manager Isobel Martin said there was £55,000 of damage.

At Regen’s shortly afterwards Burls can be seen outside the store which has had its shutters damaged already.

A number of thugs can be seen attacking the shop on footage captured on residents’ mobiles above.

A key witness saw Burls go in and set light to clothes with a lighter.

The owner, who suffered up to 
£390,000 losses including £30,000 stock which was not covered by 
insurance, said he felt ‘hopeless’ as he watched the blaze take hold 
live on the television news.

Next door, Greggs, which suffered £400,000 damage was ‘engulfed in fire’ which spread from Regen’s.

Its manager too watched the blaze spread on TV and returned two days’ later to find the ‘shell’.

Ronan Halvey, a resident of the above
 flat, saw a male taking photos of himself using a mobile phone outside 
Regen’s as others looted the shop.

He saw a female looter mouth ‘fire’ at him.

Shelley Griffith, defending, said Burls was expelled from school aged 11 and has only one previous conviction.

He explained the 23-year-old’s 
involvement as being down to a ‘lack of maturity’ and added: ‘He was 
shocked when he saw the photographs.

‘I don’t think he realised in his mind, what he intended to do.'

Southwark Council today welcomed the 
sentence and confirmed that Burls had voluntarily given up the tenancy 
of his council flat in Peckham.

Peter John, leader of Southwark 
Council, said: 'I'm sure that many people who live 
and work in Peckham will be satisfied that this sentence is appropriate 
and reflects the seriousness of his crime and the impact it has had on 
the community.'
