A soldier who became infertile after being injured by a bomb in Afghanistan launched a bitter attack on the Ministry of Defence (MoD) last night after ‘heartless’ officials rejected his bid for a Forces sperm bank.

Former soldier Rick Clement served fourteen years in The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment until he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan, losing his legs and sexual function. He wants the MoD to fund a sperm bank in case other military personnel end up like him

Sergeant Rick Clement, 35, began a campaign for the MoD to store samples provided by soldiers after a Taliban landmine blew him up in 2010, causing appalling injuries and leading to the loss of both of his legs.

Sgt Clement’s injuries prevent him from having children or a sex life, and led to the break-up of his marriage – he and his fiancee Leanne Isaacs went ahead with their wedding after the blast only for the realities of his condition to drive them apart.

The soldier, from Blackpool, said: ‘This is devastating news.

'I fear that, as a result of the MoD’s decision, more soldiers will be denied the pleasure of fathering children.

‘Many cannot afford the cost of storing their sperm privately.

'Others may take their fertility for granted.

‘The MoD has enough medical facilities to incorporate a sperm bank.

'I know what it is like to feel that you’re not a man any more.

'A guy can’t feel much worse than that, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.

‘The MoD has let soldiers down in a bid to save money, it is heartless.’

Almost a quarter of soldiers in the British Army are unfit to  fight on the front line, according to official figures.

Some
 18,460 troops out of the Army’s current strength of 84,600 are unable 
to fulfil their duties  due to injuries sustained in battle or in 
training, or other long-term health problems.

Last night, Colonel 
Richard Kemp, who led British troops in Afghanistan, said: ‘Such a small
 fighting strength puts us in the world’s third division of armies.’

Since
 UK troops began fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, 7,222 
personnel have been  admitted to British-run field hospitals in the 
country and a further 7,088 have been flown back to Britain for 
treatment.

From those totals, 610 personnel have been listed as 
seriously wounded.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘The vast 
majority of soldiers who are not fit to go on operations have only 
temporarily been downgraded and will still be able  to deploy once they 
recover.

‘Anyone who is unable to deploy still plays a vital role supporting operations and defence priorities.’

The MoD said that its decision was based on the ‘extremely low’ number of Service personnel who are infertile because of their wounds – 24  UK troops are unable to have children naturally for this reason.

It would have to pay hundreds of pounds to store soldiers’ sperm at private clinics, with prices starting at £300 for freezing and a year’s storage.

Female troops wishing to preserve egg cells face higher costs.

Solicitor Hilary Meredith also attacked the MoD’s decision, saying: ‘The Government’s lack of commitment to assisting these seriously injured soldiers is hugely disappointing.

'The least they could do is allow these men the gift to father children post-injury, which would cost so little given the happiness this would bring.’

Sperm banks proved popular in Israel after the 1973 Yom Kippur war and were used by widows of soldiers belonging to the Israeli Defence Force.

he MoD’s announcement comes after a woman won a High Court victory last month to stop her dead husband’s frozen sperm being destroyed.

Beth Warren, 28, successfully challenged the time limit for the storage of sperm set by the UK’s fertility regulator.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘Because the number of Service personnel suffering from serious groin injuries is extremely low, there are no current plans to introduce a system to store sperm or ova pre-deployment.

‘However, advice is available for all personnel and we would encourage anyone interested in finding out more to speak to their chain of command.’

Although the MoD has refused to set up a sperm bank, the Army has improved the design of garments worn by troops to protect them.

The multi-tiered pelvic protection system was introduced in Afghanistan in 2010.

Troops who sustain a groin injury are given full access to fertility preservation services on their return to the UK, if required, to reduce the risk of post-traumatic infertility.
