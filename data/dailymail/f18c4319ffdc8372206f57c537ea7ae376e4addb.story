For those seeking a gastronomic response to the ‘Supersized’ American lifestyle, Pizza Hut has the answer.

The fast food pizza chain, which introduced stuffed crusts to pizza eaters nationwide in 1995, has now unveiled its newest culinary creation – the Overstuffed Pizza.

Though nutritional information wasn’t posted on Pizza Hut’s website, one can imagine that this newest pizza invention tips the caloric scales.

Have your fill: Pizza Hut's Facebook page says 'Go all in with six jumbo slices loaded with pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese, sealed between two golden crusts'

All in: Pizza Hut's website encourages its patrons to go 'all in' on pizza night for $12.99

As the Huffington Post noted, the stuffed crust pizza became one of Pizza Hut’s best sellers, and the chain has since been introducing seemingly endless variations of the formula. Hot-dog-stuffed crusts. Cone crusts.

Adding to the fray, Pizza Hut has introduced what is best described as a cross between a deep-dish pizza and a calzone.

The restaurant writes on its Facebook page: ‘Go all in with six jumbo slices loaded with pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese, sealed between two golden crusts.’

It is offered as either an Italian Meat Trio, or a Supremo, which comes with sausage, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. Both are sold for $12.99.

Nutrition information was not available on the company’s website, but a single slice of a medium stuffed-crust pan pizza comes in at 340 calories, making the whole eight slices 2,720 calories. 

A representative did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for nutritional information.

Users on Twitter were quick to react to news of the pizza. One user, giorgiotedx, wrote: ‘Less is more, especially when it comes to pizza.’  

Another user, NevineZaki, wrote: ‘OfferStuffed arteries anyone?’

Popular: Pizza Hut, owned by Yum Foods Inc., has more than 7,200 locations throughout the U.S.

But not all tweets were negative. One user wrote that she was ordering a pizza ‘right away.’

Pizza Hut is owned by Yum Brands Inc, which also owns KFC and Taco Bell. Pizza Hut has more than 7,200 restaurants across the U.S.

The parent company recently introduced a new line of sweet snacks for its Mexican fast food chain, Taco Bell, expanding its dessert menu to include churros and cookie sandwiches to its current lineup of cinnamon twists and caramel apple empanadas.

Attracting customers to restaurants during between-meal hours has become a critical way to drive sales, as chains have to pay for fixed costs like electricity and labor anyways.

Last month, competitor Domino’s launched a deep-pan pizza with more than double the calories found in one of their regular pies. 

The 12" pepperoni pan pizza, which features a thick base, slathered with butter, two layers of cheese and toppings, boasts 2,420 calories and 130 grams of fat.

It makes for a dramatic contrast with the nutritional value of its regular thin-crust version, at 910 calories and 47 grams of fat.
