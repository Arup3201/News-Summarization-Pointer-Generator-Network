The Facebook page for a high-end nanny agency in New York has turned into a real life version of the hit 2002 novel The Nanny Diaries, revealing some of the most over-the-top requests made by rich families seeking household help. 

The staff behind Abigail Madison Nanny and Household Staffing Inc post a variety of advertisements for a wide range of positions on the company's Facebook page, each of which include a detailed description of what the family require from any future employee. 

From speaking fluent Filipino to being a professionally-qualified chef, there seems to be no end to the lofty expectations held by some of New York's most eligible families when it comes to finding the perfect person to care for their children. 

'[There are some] I would definitely call strange,' agency owner Erin Maloney-Winder told ABC News of the weird and wonderful requests her company receives.

Weird and wonderful demands: The ads featured on the Abigail Madison Facebook page include a variety of requirements, including some parents who insist their nanny must be able to home-school their children

'The most bizarre requests are generally when a parent is requiring a nanny to speak three languages,' she added to Daily Mail Online. 

'And we also have parents requesting nannies to hold a master's degree and work six days.' 

Much like those stories detailed in the New York Times best-selling novel The Nanny Diaries, which was written by former nannies Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus before being turned into a movie starring Scarlett Johansson, the requests details on the company's Facebook page range from the most simple - to the most complex. 

For example, one Upper West Side family stated that any eager applicants for the position available in their household must be fluent in both English and Tagalog, a Filipino dialect most commonly used in Manila. 

'You must be legal to work and you must have references working as a nanny, and you MUST speak English and Tagalog  fluently,' the family's ad explains, while another states: 'Please be able to clean a large formal home...

'The family has parties at their weekend home, so it is helpful if you know how to set a formal table and if you can cook healthy meals.'

One family asks that their nanny be able to take their children out for play dates - and Broadway auditions - offering a salary of $16 per hour to the successful applicant. 

Indeed, while some families are prepared to make extravagant demands of their future nanny or housekeeper, their salary offers don't always match up to their over-the-top requirements. 

Great expectations: Many wealthy New York-based families, like the family featured in hit 2007 movie The Nanny Diaries (pictured), require their nannies to speak at least two languages fluently

According to ABC, one Manhattan-based mother asked that Abigail Madison find her a nanny who could work a 50-hour week, which included home-schooling her six children, all for just $450 per week, or just $9 per hour. 

The average salary offered to nannies sourced by Abigail Madison is $800 per week for just two children - and that usually doesn't involve home-schooling of any kind.

But for those nannies who are able to meet the strict requirements of many of the families - there are usually some incredibly impressive rewards on offer. 

Many of the parents require that their household staff accompany them on all-expenses-paid holidays, with one family asking that their nanny be willing to travel with them on annual trips to Europe and Hawaii. 

Another ad, which is calling for a 'very in shape, athletic and energetic' college graduate, includes the promise of regular stays at the family's summer home in Westchester, as well as month-long getaways in South Africa and Italy. 

'We do have wonderful clients who offer five weeks of paid vacation and $65,000 per year for 45 hours with health insurance,' Ms Maloney-Winder added to Daily Mail Online.  

'We also have clients who allow nannies to order whatever food they want for lunch every day, buy their nannies Prada snow pants when they go skiing and we even had a client pay for a nanny's plane ticket to Wisconsin when her mother was in the hospital. 

'Additionally, we have clients who give $5,000 to $10,000 Christmas bonuses on occasion, but a bonus like that is rare.'
