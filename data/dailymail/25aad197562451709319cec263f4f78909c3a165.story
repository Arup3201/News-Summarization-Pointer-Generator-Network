It is a blunder that would embarrass even the most brazen of employees.

A photograph of a topless young man - albeit with a six-pack - was mistakenly posted on an official supermarket Twitter site.

And although he might have been impressed with the photogrpah, Twitter users who spotted the picture were clearly not.

But the Co-operative brushed off claims they were 'morons' and grabbed the opportunity to entice their 18,000 followers to their cut-price deals.

Topless: An image of a topless young man was posted on the Co-operative Food's official Twitter site in a 'technical' blunder

Apology: The Co-operative say the picture was result of a 'technical hiccup'

On Twitter, the supermarket blamed the posted photograph on a 'technical hiccup'.

An official spokesman for the Co-operative Food said: 'We are not responsible for posting this photograph on our Twitter feed and are currently investigating how this happened.'

The photograph was deleted in due course - but not quickly enough for the blunder to spread like wildfire across the internet.

The Twitter page has nearly 18,000 followers and those behind it were keen to make the most of the attention by advertising cut-price deals

The supermarket was lambasted as 'fools' and 'morons'. They responded denying they were 'morons'

Unimpressed followers of the chain branded the company as 'fools' and 'total morons' - to which the Co-operative responded: 'not quite morons, but affected by a technolagy (sic) bug which is being looked into'.

Perhaps the 'technolagy' bug also caused the spelling error.

The Co-op did admit on their Twitter site it wasn't 'our finest moment'.

After gaining more followers, the company tweeted; 'Whilst we have your attention...LAST CHANCE for our big deal on Walkers sensations 150g, now Â£2.15 each buy-ONE-get-TWO free. Ends today.'

They also apologised, saying: 'Hmm, sorry about that folks. Slight technical hiccup which we are still investigating - but we hope we gave you all a smile! *Mel.'

One Twitter user, Helen Purves, wrote: 'They're clearly morons'. Another user, Lauren G, wrote: 'YOU FOOLS'.
