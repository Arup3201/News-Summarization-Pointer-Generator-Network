Tragedy: D'Oliveira has died at the age of 80

England cricketer Basil D’Oliveira, whose inclusion in a squad to tour South Africa led to a sporting boycott of the apartheid regime, has died at the age of 80.

D’Oliveira, affectionately known as Dolly, was selected for the 1968 tour – but it was cancelled when the South African government refused to allow a black player to compete against its white team.

No official team from any country toured there until apartheid was abolished, following Nelson Mandela’s release from prison in 1990.

D’Oliveira, an all-rounder who was born in Cape Town in 1931, emigrated to England in 1960 and signed for Worcestershire in 1964.

He made his debut for England in 1966 and played in 44 Test matches.

In 1969 he was made an OBE and a CBE in 2005. D’Oliveira had suffered from Parkinson’s disease in his later years.

He is survived  by his South African wife Naomi Brache and their two sons, Damian and Shaun.

Damian, who also played for Worcestershire, said: ‘After a long battle with Parkinson’s, Dad passed away peacefully.’

D’Oliveira’s England team-mate Tom Graveney said: ‘It’s terrible – he was a great friend. I persuaded him to come to Worcestershire.’

Legend: Basil D'Oliveira in action. His death has been described as a great loss

Gerald Majola, Cricket South Africa’s chief executive, said: ‘Dolly was a son of whom all South Africans can be extremely proud.’

Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted: ‘RIP Basil D’Oliveira .  .  . Great man.’

CSA chief executive Gerald Majola led the tributes to D'Oliveira, whose health had been deteriorating for some time leading up to his death in England.

'"Dolly", as he was known around the world by an audience that went far beyond the game of cricket, was a true legend and a son of whom all South Africans can be extremely proud,' Majola said.

'He was a man of true dignity and a wonderful role model as somebody who overcame the most extreme prejudices and circumstances to take his rightful place on the world stage.'
