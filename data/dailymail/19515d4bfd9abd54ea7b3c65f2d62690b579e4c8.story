The boarding school where Boris Johnson was taught is being sued by former students over claims of widespread sexual abuse.

Two teachers are accused of subjecting children between the ages of seven and 13 to 'horrific' attacks in the 1970s.

Ashdown House preparatory, which is known as a feeder school for Eton, is now facing a wave of compensation claims from its former pupils.

An email was circulated this month warning those who attended the school that the abuse had been covered up.

The note, written by former pupils now suing the school, stated: 'The reason why we have decided to do this so late on is that it has come to light that sexual and physical abuse was rife between 1970 and 1980, and from more than one teacher at the school.

'To make matters worse it is now apparent the school was aware of these events, albeit not fully, but chose not to do anything about it.

'The effects of this abuse has damaged a number of pupils long into adulthood and it is felt among us that, as part of the healing process, it is important for us to take our power back and take action against such damaging and horrendous actions.'

Ashdown House, which was also attended by Homeland actor Damian Lewis, 42, charges almost £8,000 per term for boarders.

The prep school is in the village of Forest Row in East Sussex teaches around 140 pupils aged between seven and 13.

Mr Johnson was taught at the school with his brother Jo, now a Tory MP, and sister Rachel, who was the first girl boarder at the traditional English all-boys prep school.

Mr Johnson was at the school when he was awarded a scholarship to study at Eton College.

Ashdown House is first thought to have faced a police investigation after a complaint about abuse in 2003, but no one was prosecuted.

The former students who are seeking legal action are demanding a 'sincere and meaningful apology' and said they are taking action to prevent abuse from carrying on at the school.

'The abuse that occurred continues to have a dramatic effect on a number of lives, with regards to ongoing relationships, career and treatment for dealing with the psychological damage it has caused.

Therefore we are seeking compensation with regards to a civil case against the school, the email added.

The alleged victims have instructed London lawyers Slater & Gordon.

Liz Dux, from the firm, said it was 'very early days for this complex and difficult case'.

Mr Johnson's sister has said of her time at the school: 'In those days, the three Cs - the cane, cricket, and classics - were fetishistically followed.

'Despite all this, however, I was happier there - shaggy, plump, and entirely the wrong sex - than I'd ever been.'

She claims she was threatened with the cane but the headteacher spared her because she was a girl. This, apparently, led to beating being abolished at the school.

Cothill Educational Trust has owned Ashdown House since 2009.

A spokesman said: 'We are aware that Sussex police were officially informed in 2003 of an allegation of sexual abuse relating to a period in the mid-70s.

'We understood that the police were dealing with the investigation. The Trust would like it to be known that it takes its safeguarding responsibilities very seriously indeed.'
