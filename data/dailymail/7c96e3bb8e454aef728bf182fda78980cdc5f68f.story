Gloucestershire All Golds have appointed former Sheffield Eagles, Halifax, London Broncos and Huddersfield winger Lee Greenwood as their new head coach ahead of the 2015 Kingstone Press League One campaign.

The 34-year-old who was assistant coach to Karl Harrison at Batley and Halifax, succeeds Scotland head coach Steve McCormack at the Cheltenham-based club.

'They are a forward thinking club run by ambitious people,' said Greenwood.

'By appointing a young, English head coach like myself I think it shows the direction the club want to go in.'

All Golds chairman Dr Andy Pitchford said: 'We are really delighted that Lee has agreed to join us. He is an excellent leader and coach and we are sure he will have a great impact on the first team and on the aspirations of those players who are developing in our student and academy teams.'

'We are really looking forward to the new season with Lee at the helm.'
