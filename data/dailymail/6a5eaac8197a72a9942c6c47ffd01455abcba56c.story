Getting up in the middle of the night and navigating your way to the toilet can be tricky in the dark.

But a new invention will light the way - and mean men never miss the bowl again - thanks to colour-changing LEDs fitted to the seat.

Called IllumiBowl, the water-resistant lights turn on automatically using a motion sensor that detects when someone enters the bathroom.

The water-resistant, colour-changing LEDs in IllumiBowl alternate between purple (left), red, orange, blue (centre), white and green (right). The device is fitted with motion sensors that detect when someone enters the bathroom, and switches off autoamtically when they leave

They then switch off after the user has left.

The LEDs are the brainchild of 23-year-old Matt Alexander from Utah, who was inspired to create the IllumiBowl because he ‘hated turning the bathroom light on in the middle of the night’.

The LEDs are placed beneath the seat, to illuminate the entire bowl.

They alternate between red, orange, green, blue, purple and white, and users can change the colour by moving a switch on the device.

The water-resistant gadget turns on automatically using a motion sensor that detects when someone enters the bathroom. 

It then switches off after the user has left.

The 2-inch (5cm) device uses two AAA batteries, and an LED is said to last for more than 11 years.

It is available to pre-order from Mr Alexander’s Kickstarter campaign for $15 (£9), and is set to ship in January.

Mr Alexander, from Provo, Utah, said: ‘I came up with the idea because I hate turning the light on in the middle of the night!

‘The device works by a motion sensor. It turns on when you walk in and turns off when you leave.

‘It is a colour-changing LED that changes between colours every few seconds.

‘If you want to freeze it on a specific colour just move the switch and it will stay on that colour permanently unless you move the switch back. 

‘We are developing a future model with a germ killing UV LED as well.’

He admitted he also designed it to stop men from ‘missing the toilet’ in the dark - something he believes will ‘save a lot of marriages’.

It is available to pre-order from Mr Alexander’s Kickstarter campaign for $15 (£9), and is set to ship internationally in January.

The campaign has already surpassed its $20,000 (£12,500) funding target by raising more than $48,000 (£30,000) three weeks before it ends.

The $15 (£9) gadget is placed under the toilet seat (illustrated) to illuminate the bowl and was designed to stop men from ‘missing the toilet’ in the dark. The device also means users don’t have to turn the light on in the middle of the night. It can be pre-ordered from Kickstarter and is set to ship internationally in January

Mr Alexander, a student at Brigham Young University, added: ‘The device protects you from blinding light in the middle of the night.

'And it also helps parents with children because little children can’t reach the light switch and mothers want to use it to help potty train their toddlers.

‘I love how convenient it is to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night now and just how cool it looks to have a glowing throne.’
