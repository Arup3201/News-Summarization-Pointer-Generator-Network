To go free? The application follows a lacklustre prosecution case against Dewani (pictured during his trial last month

Lawyers for Shrien Dewani have launched an application to have his murder trial thrown out of court, paving the way for him to fly back to Britain a free man.

The application follows a lacklustre prosecution case against Dewani which has produced little or no concrete evidence linking the 34-year-old businessman to the honeymoon murder of his 28-year-old wife, Anni, four years ago.

The state's case – that Dewani recruited a taxi driver to organise the fatal shooting disguised as a carjacking in a rough township – struggled to gain traction during the testimonies of 16 witnesses following a string of successful rulings in favour of the defence.

A central plank of the prosecution case - that Dewani led a secret gay life that motivated him to want to be out of his new marriage - fell away on day one of his South African trial last month following a dramatic admission that he was a 'bi-sexual' who had paid gay prostitutes, frequented clubs and surfed 'hook up' sites to satisfy his sexual urges.

And today, defence lawyer Francois van Zyl opened his application by slamming the state's 'sole witness' to Dewani's alleged role in his wife's murder as 'lacking in credibility'. 

Taxi driver Zola Tongo was, according to the prosecution, recruited by Dewani to organise hitmen to a fake carjacking as the cover for his wife's death.

Mr van Zyl asked the Judge - who will alone rule on whether to clear Dewani - to agree that his client could not be convicted on the strength of what the driver told the court - testimony of 'such poor quality it cannot be reliable,' Mr van Zyl said.  

'Tongo is the pillar on which the state's case is built. If that fails, the whole state's case fails with it,' he told the Western Cape high Court.

He added that there was no doubt that there was a conspiracy targeting Mrs Dewani, but asked: 'Was the accused part of this agreement? What were the terms of this agreement? 

'The mere fact that yes, there was a hikacking, the lady was robbed ... the question is, was the accused part and parcel of this conspiracy?.

'This (application) will stand or fall with Tongo's evidence.' 

Little evidence: Defence lawyers say the prosecution case has produced little or no concrete evidence linking the 34-year-old businessman to the honeymoon murder of his 28-year-old wife, Anni, four years ago (pictured together before Anni's tragic death)

After dismissing Tongo's statements to police and evidence to the court as 'riddled with contradictions', Mr van Zyl moved on to the incredibility of the story that Dewani had hired him to kill someone within minutes of meeting him.

'How probable is it that this foreigner would arrive in this country and within half an hour asks him (tongo) to find a hitman to kill someone?' Mr van Zyl asked the court. 'This is one of two or three huge improbabilities - which cannot be irrelevant.' 

Mr van Zyl referred to CCTV footage of the newlyweds kissing and posing for photographs at the Cape Grace hotel as they waited for Tongo to collect them on the night Mrs Dewani was killed. 

'We ask ourselves how probable it is that this man knowing that this person he is kissing will be dead within an hour,' he said. 

Dewani has spent the last few days meeting his family and legal team at the high-security psychiatric hospital, where he has been held since his extradition from Britain in April, to agree a strategy for the end of his trial. 

In the best possible outcome for him, Judge Jeanette Traverso could clear him of all charges and free to board a plane back to Britain within days.

Even if the judge, who sits with two assessors and no jury, does concur with the prosecution that the trial should run its course – Dewani may still not have to face tough questioning in the witness box. 

His legal team are entitled to call no witnesses in Dewani's defence – only give their closing argument - and the judge could still rule that there is insufficient evidence before the court on which to convict him 'beyond reasonable doubt'. 

The public gallery was packed for the unusual application brought on day 23 of the high-profile trial. The families of both Dewani and his dead wife were also in court, as they have been every day of his trial. 

Dewani looked particularly animated as his lawyer introduced five themes of arguments in support of his application. His eyes darted between Mr van Zyl, the judge and the three benches filled with reporters.
