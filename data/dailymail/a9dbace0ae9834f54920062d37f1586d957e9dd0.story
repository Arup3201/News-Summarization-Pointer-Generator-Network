Cheltenham have appointed Gary Johnson as manager until the end of the season.

Johnson, who left his post in charge of Yeovil last month, has been tasked with saving the club, who are bottom of Sky Bet League Two, from relegation from the Football League.

The 59-year-old told the club's official website: 'I understand the position the club are in and I will be doing my best along with (assistant) Russell (Milton) to keep the club in the Football League.'

Johnson was at Cheltenham's 2-2 draw with Portsmouth at Fratton Park on March 17 and the 2-1 home defeat by Exeter City four days later.

'I feel I know a lot about the squad, but it's also important to have that continuity with Russell and the lads so we'll be having a good chat regarding all of the players' abilities,' Johnson said.

Cheltenham Town are bottom of Sky Bet League Two with seven games remaining

Milton, who has taken charge of nine matches since the departure of Paul Buckle in February, said: 'I am happy to be working alongside someone of Gary's knowledge and experience.

'I've been pleased with the way the players have responded since I have been in charge and I don't feel we are far away from getting things right.

'I feel performances have improved overall, with results hopefully now following.'
