George Clooney has been sucked into the growing Sony email hack maelstrom with revelations the actor was completely mortified by the failure of his 2014 film The Monuments Men, which he co-wrote.

In an email to Sony's now-embattled Amy Pascal, Clooney begged for 'protection from all the reviews' as critics began to widely pan the World War II drama.

'Let's just make it a hit,' he begged Pascal. 'I haven't slept in 30 hours. And it's 7 am.'

Mortified: George Clooney has been revealed in Sony's hacked emails to have been mortified by the critical failure of his 2014 WWII drama The Monuments Men

Clooney's co-stars in  The Monuments Men include Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman. It's based on the true story of a WWII 'tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves' according to IMDB.

Despite the abundance of star fire power, the film scores an uninspiring 31 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. And Clooney appears to have shouldered the blame.

'I fear I've let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I've just lost touch,' he wrote, according to the Independent. 'Who knew? Sorry. I won't do it again.'

Pascal, who's featured heavily in this email hack, reassured Clooney, saying: 

'We will protect you by making money… that's the best revenge.'

Wrote to the top: Clooney's emails to Sony's Amy Pascal reveal the star's embarrassment that The Monuments Men, a film he co-wrote and starred in, was a critical failure

With a budget of $70 million and a domestic take of $78,031,620, according to Box Office Mojo, Pascal's reassurance--at least stateside--did not come to fruition.

However, taken with overseas earnings of $76,952,415 for a worldwide gross of $154,984,035, the film's performance could have been far worse given the tepid reviews.

The revelation is just the latest among the spectacular leaks that are causing continuing embarrassment for Sony.

Highly sensitive material is being leaked almost daily, including an exchange between Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman, Amy Pascal. 

Rudin called Angelina Jolie a 'spoiled brat' and made racially offensive jokes about President Barack Obama's presumed taste in movies.

Rudin and Pascal have apologized.
