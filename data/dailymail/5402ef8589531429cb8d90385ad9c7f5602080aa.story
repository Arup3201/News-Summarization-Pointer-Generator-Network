Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has told how Brazil feared the worst when Neymar went down with the back injury that ended the World Cup pin-up's tournament.

Scolari revealed team-mate Marcelo asked Neymar how he was feeling after he was kneed by Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zuniga the No 10 said, 'I can't feel my legs'.

'He replied: "I can't feel my legs." Scared, Marcelo called on the team doctor, but doctors are not allowed on the pitch,' Scolari is quoted as saying in Marca.

'There was a lot of confusion. That image of Neymar being stretchered off towards the helicopter was a real shock, it was tough hearing his cries.'

Neymar left the field on a stretcher in Brazil’s 2-1 win over Colombia that set up a semi-final meeting with Germany.

An X-ray soon after showed a fracture in one of his vertebrae which the Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar confirmed would keep Neymar out of action for up to six weeks.

Scolari's revelation shows the World Cup host's camp fear it would be much longer, even career-threatening.

The coach hasn't underestimated the cost of losing Neymar for potentially two more games in the tournament, first the Germany match that could see them reach a first World Cup final since 2002. 

'Neymar is our star player, because he's the type of match-winner who would make a difference in any team,' Scolari said. 'We've lost the one player we didn't want to lose ahead of the semi-finals and the final,' he said.
