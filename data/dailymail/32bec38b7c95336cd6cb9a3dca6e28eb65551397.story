Families will splash out an average of £133.70 on Christmas Day food - but they'll throw a fifth of it in the bin.

The day's feasting will create an extra 50m bags of rubbish, or £600m of food.

As a nation we'll spend £3.3 billion on food for the Christmas table this year, according to a national survey commissioned by food waste disposer maker InSinkErator.

Leftovers: British households will throw away £600m worth of wasted food this Christmas

More than half (56 per cent) of 3,000 householders polled admit they will throw away between 20 to 30 per cent of that extra Christmas food as waste this year - a minimum of £600m of Christmas food thrown directly into our dustbins.

The knock-on effect of that extraordinary wastage is that 66 per cent of the nation will use between two and four extra bin bags to discard their unwanted Christmas food in 2011 - approximately 50 million bin bags of extra rubbish just for unwanted Christmas Day food (based on two thirds of the nation using 3 extra bin bags on Christmas Day).

Landfill: The leftover food waste from Christmas day feasting will fill an estimated 50m bin bags

That extra waste also contributes 
significantly to the 30 extra 'tidying up' hours that almost half the 
nation (49 per cent) claims it will undertake during the annual 
Christmas break.

InSinkErator spokesman Ashley Munden 
said: 'Everyone loves Christmas and Britain clearly gets into the spirit
 of things at this time of year.

The environmental impact of food waste is a huge concern

'But the environmental impact of our seasonal celebrations is clearly felt across the nation.

'We create an extra 50 million bags of food waste on Christmas Day alone.

'The cost of that food waste is staggering too - £600 million. It's truly mind-boggling.

'The environmental impact is clearly a concern - there is a huge amount of landfill required to house all that waste.

If people simply had a food waste disposer fitted into their homes it could be dealt with swiftly, efficiently and, most importantly, in a truly eco-friendly responsible fashion designed to reduce impact on landfill sites.

Food waste disposers have a positive impact on landfill and food waste is dealt with through the waste water system when disposed of through a waste disposal unit.
