James and his wife 
Christiane Duigan are the brains behind the vastly 
successful Bodyism brand, which comprises smart gyms in London, The 
Maldives and Turkey, Clean & Lean books, a health-supplement range 
plus the company’s Brazilian Body Collection of workout wear.

Oh, and they've helped whip the likes of Elle Macpherson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Hugh Grant and Lara Stone into shape too.

But what do James and Christiane, who have been dubbed the 'world's most annoyingly healthy couple', eat themselves on a day-to-day basis?

What does it take to look this good? James Duigan and his model wife Christiane have established the hugely successful Clean & Lean empire, but what do they eat themselves? The power couple have revealed all

The power couple, whose diet plan recommends fresh food as close to 
its natural state as possible, no refined sugar - described by James as a 'toxic fat
bomb' for your waistline - and no alcohol, have shared their weekly food diary with online beauty and health magazine Get The Gloss... and it's just as infuriatingly healthy as you'd imagine.

Speaking about how he starts the day, committed James said: 'My breakfast is the same every morning - a Body Brilliance and Ultimate Clean shake with rice milk or a green juice with a shot of ginger.

'When I’m in London I'll have eggs, tomato and avocado and an americano from Granger & Co in Notting Hill.'

Proving that even Mr Clean & Lean has a treat every so often, he adds: 'I’ll add a chipolata in there if I’m feeling hungry.'

James says that when he and wife 'Chrissy' are cooking at home, they'll make a 'Clean and Lean' bowl with quinoa, pesto, sweet potato, kale and asparagus.

For lunch on the move, James has grilled salmon with fresh asparagus or lamb chops and spring vegetables.

If he's at home with Chrissy, they whip up a Clean and Lean lettuce wrap with chicken tomato and hummus or go to Osteria Basilica in Notting Hill for seabass and vegetables - see, even eating out can be virtuous.

James describes dinners as 'a nice mix of dining out and staying in'. He said: 'Chrissy's magical lamb pot roast on Sunday night was amazing - lamb and vegetables slow roasted with veg for six hours.

'On Monday, we'll have Rosie Huntington Whitley’s recipe - roast chicken with brown rice and avocado and on Tuesday we'll go for sushi and treat ourselves to Chilean seabass and Japanese herb and avocado salad.'

James describes Wednesday night as 'party night' saying he and Chrissy 'cuddle up on the couch to watch a cheesy movie and for a treat we’ll have the amazing fish curry from Granger & Co as a takeaway'.

Start them young! Even the couple's adorable daughter Charlo loves a tasty green juice in the morning. The couple are currently expecting their second child

Green and lean: The Clean & Lean diet centres around eating foods in their natural state. Think eggs, avocado, fresh vegetables and no refined sugar

For dinner on Thursday and Friday 
they conjure up a mixture of quinoa, kale, avocado and beetroot salads 
with either roast chicken or grilled fish.

'As
 you can see, my lifestyle is ridiculous... I'm rock'n'roll to the core.
 I spend the rest of my time writing books and spending time with my 16 
month old daughter and singing songs to Chrissy's perfect pregnant 
tummy,' he adds.

James' most recent project was teaming up with supermodel Lara Stone to pen the Clean & Lean 
Pregnancy Guide, which he co-wrote with former 
Grazia health editor, Maria Lally, and bills itself as 'the healthy way 
to exercise and eat before, during and after pregnancy'.

He called on good friend and 
client Lara to write the foreword for his latest book, which features 
gentle, safe exercises, illustrated with step-by-step photographs, for 
every stage of your pregnancy.

There
 are specific exercises designed to get rid of your 'mum tum', healthy 
eating dos and don'ts, plus advice on the best choices when eating out 
and tips on dealing with cravings.

The
 book also includes flexible meal plans, healthy recipes and advice on 
life post-baby, including getting enough sleep, recovering lost energy 
and what to eat when breastfeeding.
