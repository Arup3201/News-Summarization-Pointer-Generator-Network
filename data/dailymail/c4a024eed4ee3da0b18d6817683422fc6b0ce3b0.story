Caught in the act: Police in Newcastle are investigating a bizarre crime - a man hurling vacuum cleaners onto the Metro line

The suspect struck at the city’s Central Metro Station after he walked in carrying the two appliances, which are thought to be Henry vacuum cleaners.

The strange offence happened at 4.50pm on Thursday, August 8.

A Northumbria Police spokesperson said: 'Police have released an image of a man seen in the area at the time who they are keen to speak to as he may have important information about the incident.'
