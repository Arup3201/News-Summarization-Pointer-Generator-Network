Thief: Police arrested Kate Meckler, an agent for the New York-based firm Warburg Realty, in April after security staff saw her take a top, a pair of jeans and a jacket from the Manhattan store without paying, according to the prosecutors' criminal complaint

A high-flying New York real estate broker has admitted to stealing $1,700 worth of designer clothes from Saks Fifth Avenue.

Police arrested Kate Meckler, an agent for the New York-based firm Warburg Realty, in April after security staff saw her take a top, a pair of jeans and a jacket from the exclusive Manhattan department store without paying, according to the prosecutors' criminal complaint.

Meckler, who sells multimillion-dollar luxury homes in Manhattan, was originally charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property, according to the complaint.

But she pleaded guilty Monday to a single count of disorderly conduct, the district attorney's office said.

The 39-year-old NYU graduate wore an expensive-looking navy dress and gold sandals for the hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court, the New York Post reported.

Meckler was sentenced to five days of community service at a soup kitchen under the plea deal her attorney struck.

Meckler helped sell a Park Avenue apartment that belonged to Rachel Uchitel, a club promoter, for $1.95 million in 2011, according to a report in the New York Observer.

It's unclear why Meckler, one of Warburg Realty's top-10-grossing agents, didn't pay for the goods worth $1,644.

According to The Post, she has a condo sale in contract for $11.5 million on the Upper East Side.

Her family also have money, with her father, Alan Meckler, CEO of Mediabistro.com, making his fortune as a tech guru with Mecklermedia Corporation.

Her grandfather, Herman Meckler, was an actor who had supporting roles in movies including Oscar winner 'Amadeus.'

A lavish Southampton mansion, owned by the family, was used in the film 'As Good As It Gets,' The Post reports.

According to Warburg's website, the broker worked as a marketing executive at Bear Stearns and Estee Lauder before becoming a real-estate agent.

Asked if the incident will affect her employment, the company's president, Frederick Warburg Peters, told Gothamist: 'I have every confidence in Kate and we continue to value highly her association with Warburg Realty.'

Meckler didn't speak to reporters as she left court teary-eyed, but her attorney Adam Miller said she looked 'forward to moving on with her life and career.'
