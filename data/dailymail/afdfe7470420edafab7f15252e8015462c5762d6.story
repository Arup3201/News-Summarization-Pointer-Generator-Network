Semi-naked women yesterday protested outside Downing Street to demand justice for rape victims ahead of a 'SlutWalk' march on Saturday.

The group called on the Prime Minister to ensure the criminal justice system takes rape and sexual assault cases more seriously.

The controversial 'SlutWalk' movement began in 2011 
after a Canadian policeman caused an outcry by telling a group of 
students that women should 'avoid dressing like sluts' in order to avoid 
being sexually assaulted. It prompted protest marches by women wearing very little.

Protest: Women stand in little more than underwear outside Downing Street

Demonstration: The women read out a prepared statement calling for more rape prosecutions

Hundreds of women are expected to take part in the London march this weekend - the latest protest by the movement which now has a worldwide following.

Yesterday, around a dozen protesters braved the chilly autumnal weather in their underwear to protest opposite Downing Street to send a message to David Cameron.

Student Anastasia Richardson, 18, said: 'All the failings of the police and courts, they are only allowed to happen because there is not proper supervision at the top, because rape is not being made a priority within the justice system.'

She claimed that only seven per cent of reported rapes resulted in a successful prosecution and added: 'Rape is essentially legal in this country. That is very much his (Mr Cameron’s) responsibility to stop.'

Spreading the message: The campaigners hope to increase support with another march on Saturday

Claims: The SlutWalk movement says police and the courts do not take rape crime as seriously as they should

Criticism: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) is accused of not doing enough to ensure rapists are jailed. Kenneth Clarke (right) did little to help with controversial comments about rape last year

Ms Richardson, from London, added: 'We want the police and courts to make rape more of a priority so more rapists get convicted.

'We want the police to take more care when they investigate cases because what we are seeing at the moment is evidence is lost, police don’t look at CCTV footage for example before it’s destroyed.'

She also urged the Crown Prosecution Service to take more cases to court.

Last year, then Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke sparked debate on the issue in this country when he declared that some rapes are more serious than others.

He suggested there
were differences between 'serious', 'proper', 'forcible', and 'date 
rape', as well as consensual sex with underage girls.

Challenged that 'rape is rape', whatever the circumstances, the Justice Secretary replied: 'No it's not.'

Outrage: Protesters taking to the streets last summer after the SlutWalk campaign started

Statement: Marchers in New York walked in their underwear and one even went topless last summer to make the statement that 
women should be able to wear what they want without risk of sexual 
attack

Reaction: The march was organised after an NYPD 
officer 'advised' women not to wear short skirts

Date rapes, Mr Clarke insisted, 'vary extraordinarily from one to another'.

In fact, the law makes no distinction between so-called date rapes or attacks by strangers.

He was later forced to apologise but in subsequent appearances, he said a 'classic' rape was when a stranger 
grabbed an 'unwilling' woman from the street and should draw a sentence 
of 'ten years plus'.

Since the SlutWalk movement began in 2011, it has aimed to highlight a culture of blame aimed at victims of sex crime instead of the attackers.

Thousands of members of SlutWalk have already marched in cities across the U.S and Canada to display anger at the original comments made by police officer Michael Sanguinetti in a health and safety talk to students at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto.

The London march in June from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square was organised through SlutWalk's London Facebook page and attended by around 5,000 people.

January last year after a Toronto policeman said women should not dress like 
'sluts' if they wanted to avoid rape

Variety of costumes: Some protesters wore jeans and T-shirts, while others wore a lot less last summer
