Scotland have confirmed they will face Ireland, Italy and France in a four-match warm-up schedule for the World Cup.

Scotland will play on four consecutive Saturdays from August 15, starting with a trip to Dublin.

They then face a double header against Italy in Turin and Edinburgh before completing their preparations in Paris.

Scotland head coach Vern Cotter said: "Clearly our priority at the moment is the forthcoming RBS 6 Nations, however we are pleased to confirm four matches against top quality international opposition ahead of the Rugby World Cup.

"The games will allow us to rotate and test a large group of players throughout these preparatory matches in what is the last opportunity for everyone to put their hand up for selection."

Scotland open their World Cup campaign against Japan in Gloucester on September 23, before facing other pool rivals USA, South Africa and Samoa.
