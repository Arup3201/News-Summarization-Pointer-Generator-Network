An elementary school classroom aide who has a side job posing partially-nude for modeling shoots has been suspended after the images were sent to the school.

The racy photographs of Kaitlin Pearson, 23, were sent anonymously to the South Street Elementary School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, on Friday and she was suspended with pay.

The school, where Pearson has worked in a special education program since November, is now investigating whether this second job affects her ability to work with children.

Photos also were sent to the Sentinel & Enterprise newspaper with a note saying, 'Can you believe that this girl was hired to work with special education children in the Fitchburg schools?!!'

Racy: Kaitlin Pearson, 23, has been suspended from her teacher's aide job after her school discovered images showing her posing partially nude. She has shared some of the images on her Instagram page, pictured

Posing: Pearson has also shared the images on her public Facebook page. Here, she poses for selfies

Some images show her posing in bikinis or sportswear at sports events, and she has appeared in multiple amateur shoots, including for ModelsMania magazine.

Other photographs that have since surfaced online show Pearson, who has a long term boyfriend, posing partially nude as she embraces other naked female models.

In the cover of a September 2013 issue of ModelsMania magazine, she appears with another topless woman.

In an online profile for Model Mayhem she specifically says she does not pose fully nude.

'I am energetic, creative, feisty, passionate about modeling, and I bring my love of life to every shoot!' she writes. 'I'm balancing modeling with a full time job, so my time is very precious. I am here to expand my modeling horizons and am interested in serious opportunities.'

The racy images can also be found on Pearson's open Facebook page.

Fitchburg schools superintendent Andre Ravenelle told the Sentinel & Enterprise that the school is investigating the matter.

Parents have had a mixed reaction to the photos, the paper reported.

'You're trying to be a role model for the kids,' said parent Andy Saocedo, while another added: 'She probably leaves work at work and her modeling career separate from her teaching career.'

Her mother, Chuck Pearson, insisted that her daughter should not be fired for the photos.

'That's her private life,' she said. 'She's 23. She's a grown up woman.'

Online presence: The Massachusetts school says it does not carry out online searches for prospective employees before hiring them, but after the incident with Pearson, pictured, it may consider it

Probe: South Street Elementary School staff are now considering if she can return to the school

The school system carried out criminal background checks on prospective employees, but does not carry out checks across social media.

Ravenelle added that school officials have not 'Googled' people before hiring them, but may now start doing so in light of this incident.

Pearson says in a Facebook message she can't comment because of legal issues.
