This is the terrifying moment a woman was buried in wet cement following a car accident in China.

The incident took place in Fuzhou, Fujian province earlier this week and left a woman pinned for 40 minutes beneath several tons of wet cement which completely crushed the roof of her vehicle.

The crash happened after Lok Wan, 39, and his girlfriend Yin Min Tai, 35, took the wrong entrance to a busy motorway and decided to make a U-turn without checking their mirrors.

A cement-laden lorry travelling close behind the couple was unable to stop in time and ploughed into the back of their car, shedding its load all over the vehicle.

Lok Wan was able to scramble free of the car but rescuers initially thought there was little chance of Yin Min Tai surviving. As they began clearing the vehicle of cement, however, they heard her moaning and 40 minutes later were able to pull her free.

Remarkably Yin Min Tai was left with little more than a few cuts and bruises as a result of the accident.
