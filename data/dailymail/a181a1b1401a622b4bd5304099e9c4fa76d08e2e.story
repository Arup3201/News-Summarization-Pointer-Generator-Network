It might be the height of fashion but the recent trend for bushy beards has caused a problem for the food industry because of its strict hygiene rules.

But hipsters don't need to worry about shaving off their facial hair for a career in catering - instead they can just wear a beard net. 

Sales of the snoods are rocketing thanks to bearded men working in the preparation or packaging of food snapping them up.

Solution: The trend for beards had been causing a problem for those working in the food industry but they don't need to worry if they wear a beard net

No need to shave: The beard snoods mean catering workers still adhere to strict hygiene rules

A firm that makes the beard snoods has reported an increase in orders of around a third over the past three years.

The current trend for beards in the UK is said to have stemmed from the 'Hipster' subculture of New York, characterised by a bushy beard, shaven hair at the side, and tattoos.

The look has gone global thanks to bearded models like Ben Dahlhaus representing designer brands while high street chains like New Look and John Lewis have used fuzzy-faced men in their advertising campaigns this year. 

As a result, earlier this year it was reported sales of razor blades have suffered while the million pound beard snood industry has reaped the rewards.

Lion Haircare & Disposables have invested in more staff and equipment to keep up with demand as the craze for breads has taken a hold in the UK and beyond.

The company, based in Nottingham, supply the snoods globally and have introduced a new range which include built-in antibacterial agents.

Adrian Wright, chief operating officer at Lion Haircare & Disposables, said: 'The last three years has seen a 32 per cent increase in beard snood volumes. This is a significant rise and we now sell well over three million snoods annually.'

'The rise in demand seems to be coming from a combination of factors. Trends towards more facial hair, whether that is full beard or the stubble look and increasing quality assurance demands during food preparation. The two aspects go hand in hand.'

Safe: The snoods meet hygiene requirements and have built-in antibacterial agents 

He said the beard snoods have has to 'evolve' to 'meet the hygiene requirements of the latest facial hair fashions'.

Mr Wright continued: 'This year our organisation modified its beard snood and hairnet products to include built-in antibacterial agents that inhibit microbial growth.

'It's not something people necessarily want to think about, but germs are a consideration where hair is present. Even moderate stubble brings additional risks of touching and scratching.'

Barbers are also benefiting from the hipster trend.

'At least 60-65 per cent of our customers have beards. It's quite a lot.'

She added: 'People have always has stubble but guy of all ages, not just students, have decided they are going to grow beards.'
