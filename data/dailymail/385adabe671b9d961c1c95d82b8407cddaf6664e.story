Manchester City midfielder David Silva suffered an injury blow  just four days before derby against Manchester United.

The Spanish playmaker limped off after just nine minutes of Wednesday's Capital One tie against Newcastle United.

Silva was left clutching his left knee after he fell awkwardly following a clumsy challenge by Newcastle defender Ryan Taylor, making a welcome first Newcastle appearance in two years after overcoming cruciate ligament trouble. 

The Spaniard looked in considerable discomfort and left the field for treatment as Yaya Toure blazed the free-kick over the bar.

Silva did return in an attempt to run off the knock but soon admitted defeat and made way for Samir Nasri to return to action after seven games out with a groin injury.

Midfielder Yaya Toure was also forced off in the second half as City went down 2-0 after goals from Rolando Aarons and substitute Moussa Sissoko.

Afterwards City boss Manuel Pellegrini said: ‘David [Silva] has a problem with his knee, we will see tomorrow (Thursday) how big it is.

'Yaya [Toure] has problem with his groin but nothing important.'

‘We must retain what we do, we must play in a normal style because at the moment we are not the team we wish to be.’
