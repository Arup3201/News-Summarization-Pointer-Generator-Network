A woman who discovered her rental home had once been a suspected serial killer’s torture chamber is moving out early after appealing to St. Louis public housing officials when her landlord wouldn't budge.

Catrina McGhaw only discovered that the house in Ferguson, Missouri, had been home to Maury Travis after a family member told her to watch a cold case documentary about serial killers on the A&E network.

Travis, a 36-year-old waiter, committed suicide in jail in 2002 after he was charged with killing two St. Louis area women.

Police however believe he was responsible for as many as 20 murders in the area. Prior to his capture, Travis had sent a map to identify victim 17 to a local newspaper. 

Police were able to trace the map, which he made using a web program, to his computer.

When police searched his home, they found makeshift cells in the basement and videos of Travis tormenting women before tying them up to a wooden beam that still stands to this day.

‘This whole basement was his torture chamber and it’s not okay,’ McGhaw told KMOV.

The landlord even gave her the dining room table; the same one from the crime scene photos.

‘When she showed us the house, she said you can have this table if you want,’ said McGhaw, who had signed a lease in March.

The landlord turned out to be Sandra Travis, the killer’s mother.

The tenant begged to get out of her lease, but Sandra Travis wasn't sympathetic. She told KMOV that she had told McGhaw about the home's grim past. 

McGhaw denies that and claims she would have remembered if she had been informed that people had been murdered in the basement.

The tenant then took her complaint to the St. Louis Housing Authority which told her she can break the lease and she moves out later this month.
