She was known as the nation's sweetheart after her dimples, sartorial prowess and cheeky Geordie personality won over the nation as a panellist on the X Factor.

As a result, her annual calendar became the best selling of all the female calendars.

But now it seems that Cheryl Cole has lost her crown - and to none other than Kelly Brook.

Model Kelly has put an end to Cheryl’s four year reign as calendar queen after her calendar became the best selling on Amazon this year.

Girl group Little Mix, pop princess Kylie Minogue and southern sweetheart Taylor Swift also made the top five in the sales stakes.

Boy band One Direction are Britain’s biggest pin-ups in the men's sector, selling more calendars than any other celebrity including long-time favourite Cliff Richard.

The 1D boys - Harry Styles, 19, Liam Payne, 20, Zayn Malik, 20, Niall Horan, 20, and Louis Tomlinson, 21 – have dominated calendar sales since their debut album three years ago according to Amazon’s all-time bestseller list.

One Direction beat Cliff Richard, who until 2011, topped calendar sales every year since online retailer Amazon started in 1998.

Xavier Garambois, vice president of EU Retail at Amazon, said: 'Calendars and Christmas go hand-in-hand, as shoppers look to start their new year with their favourite stars.

'The impact of the X Factor can certainly be seen with many of the bestsellers coming from former contestants, judges or artists that regularly appear on the show.

'Before 2011, no one could get near Cliff Richard at the top of the calendar charts but One Direction’s unrivalled popularity has seen them shoot to the top of the annual bestsellers list for the third year running.

'However, Cliff Richard has just announced that his 2014 calendar will be his last, so we could well see Cliff move further up the calendar chart before the year is out as customers look to snap up a copy in the run up to Christmas.'
