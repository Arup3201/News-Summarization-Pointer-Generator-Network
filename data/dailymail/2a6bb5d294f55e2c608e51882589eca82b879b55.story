Frat boy: Jeffrey Yam, 21, is one of two Syracuse University students charged with first-degree hazing for allegedly making three fraternity pledges to crawl in the snow

A Syracuse University pledge may lose four fingers after being forced to crawl in the snow and perform late-night push-ups, and two fraternity members now face charges for the hazing stunt.

Three young men pledging the Nu Alpha Phi fraternity were taken to Lower Hookway Park around midnight Saturday and made to do exercises wearing hooded sweatshirts, pants, boots but no gloves for 'failing to perform their daily duties,' according to Syracuse police.

Pledges usually perform physical exercise in the attic of the fraternity house at 739 Ackerman Avenue, according to police. 

After about 30 minutes of crawling and rolling around in the snow, the pledges were given hand warmers and told to walk back to the frat house, according to police.

One of the pledges, an unidentified 20-year-old man, experienced extreme pain in his hands and sought treatment Sunday at a hospital.

'He ran his hands under warm water, but his hands were still extremely painful,' police said in a release.

Doctors told him he may lose his ring and pinkie fingers on both hands because of severe frostbite. Syracuse police Lt. Eric Carr said the unidentified victim will have an appointment Thursday or Friday to check the condition of his fingers.

'Obviously he's concerned because this could be a life-altering injury,' Carr said.

Police on Wednesday arrested frat members Tae Kim, 19 and Jeffrey Yam, 21 and charged them with first-degree hazing, a misdemeanor. They were released and will appear in court March 18.

It could not immediately be determined if the two men had lawyers.

Syracuse University has suspended Nu Alpha Phi, which is described on its website as an Asian-interest fraternity with seven chapters at New York colleges and one in New Jersey. 

Harsh measures: A trio of Syracuse students were pledging to Nu Alpha Phi fraternity Saturday night when they were herded to a nearby park and forced to do push-ups without gloves. A 20-year-old suffered severe frostbite as a result,  which may cost him four fingers 

Response: Syracuse officials said the college has zero tolerance for any form of hazing 

'The university has zero tolerance for any form of hazing and takes this matter extremely seriously,' the school said in a statement.

Yam and Kim will be subjected to a code of conduct hearing to determine their future at the university.  

Police said the two other pledges refused to participate with the investigation. One of the other pledges had swollen hands and blistering, Carr said.
