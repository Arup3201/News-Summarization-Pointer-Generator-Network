You heard it here first: big pockets are going to be, well, big, next season. And it's all thanks to Apple.

At 5.5 inches tall, the larger version of the new iPhone 6, believed to be launching next year, poses a sartorial problem for those accustomed to carrying their phone on their person.

And while American Apparel-clad teens might be embracing the fannypack, it is hardly an appropriate solution for those of us who remember the look the first time around.

Luckily, the fashion industry - unintentionally - has catered well to the tech set in the fall/winter 
collections.

Louis Vuitton's Sixties-style skirts come with oversized square pockets 
that could comfortably accommodate the jumbo smartphone, while Miu Miu's transparent raincoat allows one to show it off with pride.

Queen of cool Isabel Marant showed slouchy pants and shorts with softer pocket shapes, as did Citizens of Humanity, albeit in leather.

And at Givenchy, Riccardo Tisci came up with trouser pockets so wide and deep, they rival Mary Poppins' bag for capacity.

As for menswear, the 
enduring trend for slim-fitting pants means that there is little phone 
space to be found in the pockets. But at Belstaff and J. Crew, 
motorcycle-inspired legwear boast outer pockets that welcome tech 
paraphernalia.

There are more hero pieces still when it comes to jackets. Berluti managed to fit large pockets onto all manner of outerwear - including, remarkably, the fitted suit.

But while these external and oversized pockets are just lucky timing on the part of the designers, New York-based fashion journalist Lauren Sherman anticipates that the industry will be quick to attempt to profit from Apple's latest launch.

'I can 
definitely see brands tweaking products to accommodate the new iPhone 
size,' she told MailOnline. 'It'll be most evident in things like 
handbags and jackets, places where pockets are easy to rejigger.'

But will the denim industry sacrifice those perfectly-placed pockets and stitching for tech? She thinks not.

'Whether or not jean pockets will spread remains to be seen! It depends on how popular the iPhone 6 ends up being, I think.'

Of course, if oversized pockets are not your thing, there is always the bag. Designer manbags are more popular than ever, and typically, a woman's purse has plenty of space.Â

Except for when it comes to evening bags, that is. Taylor
 Lorenz, MailOnline's head of Social Media, remarks: 'I have this tiny gold clutch 
that I love and carry out all the time, but it's super narrow. I'm 
worried that with a bigger phone it won't close.'

Luxury
 accessories label Valextra is already on the case, and will debut a 
special iPhone 6 clutch as part of its first-ever resort collection, while Neiman Marcus will be stocking a dazzling crystal-studded phone cover that you won't want to hide in any case.
