A Massachusetts utility worker mistakenly punctured a high-pressure pipeline on Friday causing a natural gas explosion that destroyed a building housing a strip club.

The explosion injured 18 people and damaged 42 buildings in an entertainment district in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of New England's largest cities.

No one was killed in the explosion.

Building down: Inspectors stand in debris, Saturday, Nov. 24, 2012, at the site of a gas explosion that leveled a strip club in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Friday evening

Investigators were trying Saturday to figure out what caused the blast 
that could be heard for miles and left a large hole in the ground where the
multistory building housing the Scores Gentleman's Club once stood while scattering debris over several blocks.

State Fire Marshal Stephen Coan said on Sunday that the Friday night blast was caused by ‘human error.’

He didn't name the Columbia Gas Co. worker who pierced the pipe while responding to reports of a gas leak.

The worker damaged the underground pipe while using a metal probe to locate the source of the leak, Coan said.

A flood of gas then built up in a building that housed a strip club, and some kind of spark touched off the blast, officials said.

Coan said the employee was following older markings on a sidewalk that indicated the location of the gas line.

More damage: An apartment building near the area where the gas explosion occurred is seen with shattered windows, among other damage

He appeared to be an appropriate distance from the line, but the markings were incorrect and the worker accidentally punctured the pipe.

A message left for a Columbia Gas spokeswoman wasn't immediately returned. Columbia Gas, a subsidiary of public company NiSource Inc., announced earlier Sunday that it planned to open a claims center for residents and businesses affected by the explosion at City Hall on Monday.

Preliminary reports showed the blast damaged 42 buildings housing 115 residential units.

Three buildings were immediately condemned, and 24 others require additional inspections by structural engineers to determine whether they are safe.

The building that housed the Scores Gentleman's Club was completely destroyed.

After the pipe was ruptured, authorities evacuated several buildings. Most of the people injured were part of a group of gas workers, firefighters and police officers who ducked for cover behind a utility truck just before the blast.

The truck was demolished.

Some officials said it was a miracle no one was killed. Springfield Fire Commissioner Joseph Conant praised the actions of city firefighters.

‘The firefighters did an excellent job evacuating the area which certainly prevented additional civilian injuries and saved many lives,’ Conant said.

Columbia Gas officials have been cooperating with investigators and have determined that there are no more gas leaks in the neighborhood, Mayor Domenic Sarno said.

Coan said the investigation is being turning over to the state Department of Public Utilities. It's not clear whether investigators will ever be able to determine what caused the spark that ignited the explosion.

Springfield, which is 90 miles west of Boston and has about 150,000 residents, is the largest city in western Massachusetts.

It's known as the home of the Basketball Hall of Fame, which is not near the blast site.

The city has been rebuilding from damage caused by a tornado in June 2011.
