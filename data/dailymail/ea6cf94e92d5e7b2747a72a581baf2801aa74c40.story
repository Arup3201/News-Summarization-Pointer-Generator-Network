Is England boss Roy Hodgson right to recall Rio?

Roy Hodgson admitted Rio Ferdinand has every right to feel a 
'grievance' towards him as he ended the Manchester United defender's 
international exile.

Ferdinand, who has not played for England since a Euro 2012 qualifier 
against Switzerland in June 2011, returns for the World Cup qualifiers 
against San Marino and Montenegro.

England head coach Hodgson has dropped Joleon Lescott from the 26-man 
travelling party, which includes the recalled Ben Foster, Michael Dawson
and Scott Parker.

Rio returns: Manchester United defender Ferdinand is back in the England squad. His last game for the Three Lions was in June 2011

GOALKEEPERS Hart (Man City), Foster (West Brom), Forster (Celtic).

DEFENDERS Baines (Everton), Cahill (Chelsea), A Cole (Chelsea), Dawson (Tottenham), Ferdinand (Man United), G Johnson (Liverpool), Smalling (Man United), Walker (Tottenham).

MIDFIELDERS Carrick (Man United), Cleverley (Man United), Gerrard (captain, Liverpool), Lampard (Chelsea), Lennon (Tottenham), Milner (man City), Osman (Everton), Parker (Tottenham), Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Walcott (Arsenal), Young (Man United).

FORWARDS Defoe (Tottenham), Rooney (Man United), Sturridge (Liverpool), Welbeck (Man United).

Hodgson, who has yet to speak with the Manchester United defender about his selection, said yesterday: 'If Rio has a grievance and does hold it against me because I haven't previously selected him there's not much I can do about that. It's a concern, but I can't do more than I am by giving him a chance to come back and making it clear I would like to use him. I can't do more.

'I like to do my talking to players face to face. The telephone sometimes is not the greatest of instruments, especially if you don't know people extremely well.'

Hodgson has always quoted footballing  reasons for Ferdinand's omission and inadvertently appeared to end his England career in an unguarded conversation with a fellow passenger on a Tube train last October.

The defender is understood to have been shocked by yesterday's announcement, but honoured to be playing for his country again.

Ferdinand has had an uneasy relationship with Ashley Cole after the Chelsea defender gave evidence on behalf of retired England skipper John Terry in his court case with Anton Ferdinand last July.

Rio was fined £45,000 by the FA over his infamous 'choc ice' tweet after the trial, a slang reference to Cole's ethnicity. Cole was later fined £90,000 for calling the FA a 'bunch of t****' when Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 after he was found guilty of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand.

Recalling Rio: Hodgson has brought back Ferdinand

England manager Roy Hodgson and Under 21 counterpart Stuart Pearce will go head-to-head at the Madejski Stadium in May as the Football Association help celebrate 125 years of football in the British Army.

A line-up of FA legends, managed by Hodgson, will take on the current British Army team who will be bossed by Pearce.

The likes of Jens Lehmann, Gary Neville, Gareth Southgate, Paul Merson, Ledley King, Matt Le Tissier and Dietmar Hamann will line up for the FA Legends.

The FA have donated £10,000 to help get the event off the ground with ticket sale proceeds going to service charities that promote sporting opportunities for soldiers, including wounded servicemen who play sport as part of their rehabilitation.

The fixture also forms part of the FA's 150th anniversary celebrations and chairman David Bernstein said: 'We at the FA greatly value our close relationship with the Armed Forces and believe that we should celebrate their work whenever possible.

'In fact, the Army has a proud heritage with the Football Association going all the way back to our formative years in the 1860s. This match will be more than fitting, especially with the Army FA marking their 125th anniversary.'

However, Cole and Rio Ferdinand shook hands before Sunday's FA Cup clash
between United and Chelsea and it is understood they are prepared to 
put their differences behind them in the interests of the national team.

Hodgson added: 'They were very good friends, but we are talking about England as a football team and not purely individuals.

'I expect the pair of them to do their job with England. Ashley has to 
do his job at left back and Rio has to do his at centre half.

'I don't expect any problems. If there are any I will have to deal with 
them, but I'm rather hoping the long-term friendship can re-emerge and 
the unfortunate incident along the way can be forgotten. The spirit in 
the group is good and they do seem to care about each other.

'I would be unhappy if there were tensions between players in a group, 
but this is an  England team and these players are fierce rivals 
sometimes on the field of play.

'We are talking about two very experienced professional players here and
we are talking about the England football team. I don't envisage any 
problems.'

England's head coach watched Ferdinand, who has 81 caps, play against 
Real Madrid in the Champions League at Old Trafford last week and again 
in the FA Cup quarter-final with Chelsea. Hodgson added: 'If he is still
playing in 2014 like he is now then there is no reason why he cannot be
part of the squad in 2014 for the World Cup.'

Football reasons: Hadgson said it was a no-brainer to recall Ferdinand

England play San Marino a week today  and then travel on to Montenegro 
for a World Cup qualifier that could shape Hodgson's destiny.

England go into the game behind  Montenegro in second place in Group H, 
knowing they need a win to put automatic qualification for Brazil 2014 
back in their own hands.

The big test for the squad will come in Podgorica, when Wayne Rooney  
will return to the stadium where he was sent off in a Euro 2012 
qualifier against Montenegro.

Together again: Ferdinand and Cole have not played with each other since June 2011

At arm's length: Hodgson insists Cole and Ferdinand are good friends but it will be interesting to see how they get on

Glove story: West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster has ended his international sabbatical and returns to the squad

Hands on: Manchester City's Joe Hart is expected to be first choice with Celtic's Fraser Forster challenging him

How it stands: Group H

Hodgson added: 'You don't forget  a sending off but his disciplinary 
record, ignoring the occasion when he  paid dearly against Montenegro, 
has been very good. I will be speaking to  all the players.

'Away matches at this level require a  lot of discipline, but I won't 
single  out Wayne. He has not let me down as  a player, so I have no 
reason to  doubt him.'

Dawson, who has won only four caps,  is back in the squad for the first  time since his appearance against Wales in March 2011.

Hot spurs: Tottenham's Michael Dawson and Scott Parker (R) are back in the England fold

National service: Chelsea defender Gary Cahill keeps his place in Hodgson's squad

Leading the way: Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard will captain England

Centre of attention: Chelsea's Frank Lampard and Manchester United's Michael Carrick are options in midfield

Hands up if you're in the England squad: Wayne Rooney will look to lead the line for the Three Lions in San Marino and Montenegro

Forward thinking: Manchester United star Danny Welbeck and Arsenal ace Theo Walcott (R) are also included
