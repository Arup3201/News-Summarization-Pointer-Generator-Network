The wife of injured England physio Gary Lewin has today blamed his broken ankle on Brazilian groundsmen who watered astroturf in front of the dugout.

Maggie Lewin, 51, said her husband was 'disappointed' to fly home from the World Cup early after he was injured celebrating Daniel Sturridge's goal against Italy in Manaus on Saturday night.

England’s own physio had jumped in delight only to dislocate his ankle and also break his tibia and fracture his fibia, Mrs Lewin said.

The 50-year-old was in agony as he received treatment from both FIFA officials and players on the sideline before 
he was carried down the tunnel on an orange stretcher.

Mrs Lewin admitted she felt 'slightly sick' as she and millions of others saw her husband badly hurt.

She will be waiting for Gary when he 
arrives home in Essex this evening.

According to The Sun she told friends on Facebook: 'Gary is obviously disappointed to be 
flying home early. The artificial turf was wet where the groundsmen had 
been spraying.

'He's hopefully being operated on tomorrow night. Just really 
gutted for him. He's broken the end of his tibia and fractured the end 
of his fibula.'

The Brazilian groundsmen at the Arena Amazonia have already been widely criticised for the state of the pitch for England's crucial first group game.

Photographs taken during and after the game showed the surface was lifting dangerously and the loose turf could have led to serious injury.

Just hours before the match ground staff were putting the finishing touches to the pitch as they tried to cover up dry grass by painting the brown patches green.

Explaining what happened to Mr Lewin an England source said: ‘Gary leapt into the air as Sturridge scored and everyone was leaping about,’ said one England source.

The physio was said to be ‘gutted’ after being stretchered off from the side of the pitch in Manaus on Saturday night.

A
 source said: ‘On the flight home a few of the lads joked with him that 
he was the one supposed to be looking after them – not the other way 
round.

‘As soon as it happened Frank Lampard was one of the first  players who went to help him.

‘Gary has been a little sheepish about the whole thing.’

England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Lewin, 50, had suffered a fractured and dislocated ankle.

He said: ‘Our doctor was able to set it in the 
sense he was able to put it back at the side of the field, but it is the
 end of the World Cup for him I’m afraid.'

Last night Lewin’s daughter Rebecca confirmed her father had left hospital, adding:  ‘He is just gutted really.’

Former
 England captain Rio Ferdinand was forced to apologise after tweeting: 
‘What happened to running it off??? Our physio has to man up!!’

Less
 than an hour later he tweeted again: ‘Just found out that Gary Lewin’s 
injury was serious so apologies for previous tweets on the injury. My 
bad.’

Lewin, who spent 22 years working as Arsenal’s physio and has carried out the same role for England since 1996, is due to fly home within the next 24 hours.

The injury to Lewin comes just days after Roy Hodgson’s assistant Ray Lewington had emergency knee surgery before England’s warm-up friendly in Miami.

Lewington arrived at the Royal Tulip team hotel in Rio de Janeiro last week using a pair of crutches.
