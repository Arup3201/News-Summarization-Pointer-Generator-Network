The Holy Grail of fashion is how to dress the bigger, older woman without making her feel patronised, ripped off or marginalised.

Many have tried. Clothing tags at plus-size shop Evans show if the style will suit an apple or pear shape, and the brand hired trendy design duo Clements Ribeiro to create a collection, where the designers broke all the ‘big girl rules’ by using patterns, stripes and showing bare flesh.

Marks & Spencer is also making an attempt with its new lines for bigger women, which use a more accurate mannequin, better fabrics, and seams, darts and waistbands. 

Into the fray comes Marisota, the online retailer, which caters for the plus-size and over-35 woman who loves fashion.

And of all the brands, I would wager it has done its homework. So, could this be the label to change the way larger women shop for ever?

I went to view its autumn/winter range at its lab in Manchester, where Marisota employs ten buyers, five fabric technologists and six ‘shapeologists’.

I met one such shapeologist, Hannah Pemberton, who says her role is about being a ‘creative planner’. If, like me, you don’t know what that means, she can enlighten us: ‘It’s my job to empathise and understand what goes on in a woman’s head — how she thinks and feels about her looks and body, and how confident she is.’ 

She does this by listening to women. And she has listened to a lot — 1,500 of them from size 12 (which is where Marisota starts) to a size 32, aged 40 to 70.

So what did Marisota find out? A whopping 77 per cent want to hide their stomachs.

Nearly half struggle to find clothes that suit their shape. More than 79 per cent want to hide their flaws, while 81 per cent want to enhance their best bits (I can’t think why this wasn’t 100 per cent for both).

Most of them get style help from their daughters, a huge number avoid social outings because they have nothing to wear, and most are repelled by negative language in advertising — words such as ‘repair’ and ‘fix’. Finally, the brand found that as we get older we are less obsessed with size and more interested in our shape.

Marisota has used fabric technology to ensure every garment has some sort of hidden panelling and support, as well as clever colour blocking (think Stella McCartney’s famous trompe l’oeil red carpet dress; it’s no surprise to discover a consultant on the brand is stylist Cheryl Konteh, who dresses Kate Winslet) to give its wearer a waist.

Best of all, it has a bespoke service, so if you happen to be top heavy, say, you can have a dress adjusted to suit. All this, plus wide-fit boots and shoes, and lingerie with bras that go up to an L — the biggest cup size available in the UK.

But what of the new, cutting-edge autumn/ winter collection? It is all monochrome, which apparently is what bigger women want.

There are sleeves, lace panels, and secret support for tummies and buttocks, even in a very floaty floral dress, at just £50. There is a great pencil skirt with a patterned panel that really does slim the hips, at £35, and a bodycon illusion dress, £45.

There is a lovely pink pea coat, £55, that I prefer to the more tweedy coats, which I imagine big women will think makes them look even chunkier.

Similarly, a poncho-style sweater would, I think, make a larger women feel like a house. Shirts, at £25 to £35, cleverly don’t gape at the bust, and the sleeves are neither too narrow nor too voluminous. Fabrics aren’t  natural or top notch, but you do need Lycra or Elastane to hold bits and bobs in, so I will let them off.

My only gripe, but it’s a big one, is that the campaign has been shot on a size 12 model. The brand managers say this is what shoppers want, but do we, really?

The model in the promotional video is thin. So we put some pieces on a model who is a size 16, and I think they look even better.

I like the stretchy tuxedo trousers — they have a  stripe that’s slimming, as is the high waist — and the metallic jacket, though I’d have added vents to give it a kick.

On the whole, though, shapes are a bit boxy, which meant we added bulldog clips at the back to ‘nip’, and the sleeves a little too wide. My best buy is the faux Stella McCartney tote with chains, £55.

I’m assured the festive collection will be more fun, without making us look like Christmas trees. Let’s hope they have the courage, having seen our photo shoot, to use a model who is truly representative.

As one size 20 fan of the brand told me when I showed her the new looks: ‘We need proper chunky.’
