Expect the poles to be replaced with crosses and songs of praise instead of seedy music - as this former strip club could soon become a church.

Art Hage is already a pastor of several churches but now wants to set up a new one at the notorious Pink Pony in Cross Lanes, West Virginia.

The Hurricane Bible Church & Ministries preacher wants to raise $795,000 to buy the old strip club, which has been on sale for more than a year.

House of God: Art Hage is already a pastor of several churches but now wants to set up a new one at the notorious Pink Pony in Cross Lanes, West Virginia

Plan: The Bible Church & Ministries preacher is hoping to raise $795,000 to buy the old strip club, which has been on the market for more than a year

‘It's been a haven of evil,’ he told WSAZ. ‘When good people do nothing, nothing happens. When good people do something, something happens.

‘Christians that love God, they'll come because they want to help other people,’ he said, before adding: ‘We've got to raise about $795,000.’

His church also operates the Faith Mission, where he runs projects for the homeless and drug addicts with his parishioners.

‘There's so many people that are down and out and they're really going through hard times,’ his parishioner Paul Bentley told WSAZ.

Current base: Pastor Art said if the church can raise all the money then it will probably take up to a year to rework and expand the former strip club

Old sign: The club lost its liquor licence in 2003 and failed in a 2008 reapplication because it was too close to an alcohol-serving TGI Friday's restaurant

The club lost its liquor licence in 2003 and failed in a 2008 reapplication because it was too close to an alcohol-serving TGI Friday's restaurant.

The Pink Pony became notorious in 2003 when Powerball millionaire Jack Whittaker was allegedly drugged and robbed there.

Charges against two staff who were accused
of robbing him of more than $500,000 were dropped - and he eventually got the money back, 
reported the Charleston Gazette.

Pastor Art said if the church can raise all the money then it will probably take up to a year to rework and expand the former strip club.

He is expecting up to 300 families to join the church, but if they can’t raise all the money then what they have will go towards existing projects in Hurricane.

‘Gambling, drinking - all of it's bad and it produces a society that's out of control,’ he told the Charleston Gazette. ‘It has got to be stopped.’
