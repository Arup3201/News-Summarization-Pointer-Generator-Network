A Polish thug told a judge to ‘f***’ off through an interpreter as he was jailed for Tasering a robbery victim in her home.

Marcin Stecki swore from the dock at Judge John Lodge as he sentenced him to 13 years and eight months for a 'illogical, motiveless and disturbing' attack.

Earlier he shouted: 'Hurry up. Have you finished yet? You better finish off real quick,' - translated by a taxpayer funded interpreter at Basildon Crown Court, Essex.

He and accomplice Jacek Cupial - both wanted for violent crimes in their native Poland - bound and gagged their victim, Kim Hyde, aged in her 50s, and zapped her in the head, chest and body with a Taser gun while demanding cash.

She told police officers she thought she was going to die during the horrific incident at her home in Woodside, Leigh, Essex.

She managed to wrestle the gun off her two attackers and attempted to stun them with it, but they overpowered her during the terrifying incident.

Stecki, was jailed for 13 years and eight months for aggravated burglary, possession of an offensive weapon and assault yesterday.

His accomplice, Jacek Cupial, received 13 years and one month for his part in the incident, at an earlier hearing.

Both are wanted on international arrest warrants for violent crimes in their native Poland and will return there after serving their sentences.

The officer that investigated the horrific incident, Det Con Mark Sawyer, from Southend CID, described it as one of the most 'illogical, motiveless and disturbing' cases he has investigated during his 12 years as a police officer.

A detective has praised the bravery of Mrs Hyde claiming her resiliance probably saved her life.

Det Con Mark Sawyer, from Southend CID, said the fact she fought back against the men may have saved her.

He said: 'It has been a long process to get this case to this point.

'The attack itself was horrific.

'I have been a police officer for 12 years and a detective for CID for five years and I have never heard of or investigated an incident so serious, so motiveless and with so little logic behind it.

'It is important for me to pay tribute to the bravery of the victim in this case.

'Her resilience and the strength she found on that day to fight back against her attackers saved her life.'

Mr Sawyer said the pair were intent on committing crime.

He added: 'The most disturbing part of this incident is that Stecki and Cupial travelled to Essex prepared.

'They brought the tape and the stun gun. They were not just opportunists..'

He added: 'I am extremely pleased with the sentence given to Stecki and Cupial.

'Not just because it shows how serious this case was, but because it will hopefully give the victim some peace of mind that these two criminals are off the streets and that justice has been done.'

Catherine Bradshaw, prosecuting, told the court that Ms Hyde had been at home when Stecki and Cupial knocked at her door, and speaking in broken English offered to do garden work on July 24 last year.

Mrs Hyde told them she had a gardener, but struggling to understand the pair, went to close the door so she could telephone her husband and check if he had employed them.

But the pair barged into the house and attacked Mrs Hyde with Stecki putting her in a headlock and forcing her to the floor to keep her still.

They then bundled her into a bedroom where Stecki put his hand over her mouth, told her to be quiet and shoved her face into the carpet.

He then took out a taser gun and zapped her head, chest and body.

Ms
 Bradshaw said: 'She was extremely scared, she was screaming and 
struggling for her life. Mrs Hyde thought she was going to be killed.

'When she saw them take the throw she thought she would be suffocated.'

The pair then began shouting 'money' at Mrs Hyde while striking her on her head and body.

Mrs
 Hyde managed to wrestle the Taser gun off the pair and attempted to 
stun them with it, but they over-powered her, took out a roll of gaffer 
tape and wrapped it around her head to cover her mouth.

The court heard the pair then began opening drawers in the bedroom before making off.

At a previous hearing it was heard that Stecki only took £50 during the incident.

Mrs Hyde suffered a fractured eye socket and cuts and bruises in the attack.

Stecki
 was tracked after leaving a bloodied palm print in Mrs Hyde's house 
while Cupial was picked up after he was arrested for stealing cars from 
the hire company he worked for at Heathrow Airport.
