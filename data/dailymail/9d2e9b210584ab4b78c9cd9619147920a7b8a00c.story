A man who strangled his elderly neighbour before hiding her body under a wheelbarrow after she rejected his sexual advances has been found guilty of murder.

Patrick Curran, 38, killed widow Joan Roddam, 74, because he was obsessed with 'granny porn' - sexually explicit images of elderly women.

Curran, of Delabole, Cornwall, had a 'raised libido' when he went to the home of the pensioner, who was a friend of his mother.

But when she rejected his advances he killed her and buried her body under a wheelbarrow and a blanket in a field behind her house.

Pornographic material, depicting women in their 70s or older having sex with men in their 20s, was found on a computer seized from Curran's home two years later.

He has now been convicted, at Truro Crown Court, of murdering Mrs Roddam on November 8, 2003.

The loner was arrested after a cold case review last year led to a DNA breakthrough.

Curran refused to attend any of the proceedings and wouldn't even leave his cell - so he was not represented in court. He will be sentenced at a later date.

Judge Graham Cottle told the jury: 'I told you the truth from the very start because I did not want you to think this man had run away.

'He is still in Exeter prison, on a daily basis he has been given the opportunity to come here but on every day he has declined that opportunity. We have done what we can to engage him in this process.'

The trial heard that DNA from a bloodstain on the blanket used to cover Mrs Roddam was 'one billion times' more likely to belong to Curran than another man.

The jury was also told the motive of his visit was likely to be strong sexual interest in older woman that saw him visit 151 'granny porn' websites on his computer and download more than 100 images of semi-naked women aged 60 to 80.

Simon Laws QC, prosecuting, previously said Curran was hoping for sex when he visited Mrs Roddam, who lived alone with three cats.

Mr Laws told the jury: 'Here is a dead woman of an age group that he found sexually attractive, covered by a blanket that had his DNA on it.

'He can only say that all of this has happened by chance, that it is all nothing but sheer bad luck.

'The prosecution say to you, simply nobody could be so unfortunate.'

The prosecution said Curran also burnt significant items including jeans and a hard drive to remove any trace he was there.

Curran's father had rung emergency services in the run up to the killing because he was concerned about how 'distressed' his son was.

One of the three doctors who examined Curran, then 27, told the jury that at the time he was 'concerned' about Curran's mental wellbeing.

He will be sentenced at Truro Crown Court on January 27.

Aine Rendell, the great niece of Joan Roddam, made a statement on behalf of the family.

She said: 'We still find it difficult even after all these years to come to terms with the fact that Joan was murdered by somebody that she knew and trusted.

'Patrick is the son of Margaret Curran who cared for Frank, Joan's husband, before he died.

'Margaret remained a friend of Joan's after Frank's death and it has been hard for us to accept why somebody so close to Joan could have killed her. 

'During the trial we have heard details about Joan's death that have shocked us. Joan did not deserve to die in these circumstances.

Mrs Roddam's killer was finally arrested after a cold case review last year led to a DNA breakthrough

'We cannot understand why Patrick Curran did not come to court to defend himself and face us as a family.

'We are glad that finally today justice has been served.'

Following the verdict, the Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Stuart Ellis said: 'The murder of Joan Roddam occurred some 11 years ago.

'Since that time her family and the community in which she lived has had to deal with this tragedy and all its consequences.

'I hope that the conviction of Patrick Curran now, will in some way bring comfort and reassurance to all those who have been affected.'
