Talks have started to make a Wembley blockbuster next year between Amir Khan and newly-crowned IBF welterweight world champion Kell Brook.

Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn has wasted no time in opening discussions with Khan’s representatives after the Sheffield fighter’s impressive win over Shawn Porter in California on Saturday.

Hearn believes the fight, which he wants to make in the spring or summer of 2015 would be big enough to justify a return to Wembley.

But he has insisted it will be arranged on more even terms, having previously offered Khan £3m and a hefty share of the purse split in earlier attempts to make a bout.

Writing in his Sportsmail column, in which he said a fight with Floyd Mayweather could become a possibility, Hearn said: ‘He came of age in that ring against Porter and great things lie in wait for him, including Amir Khan.

‘I am looking at next spring or summer in a fight, maybe at Wembley, that will be just as big as Froch-Groves. I’ve started talks on it.

‘Khan is suddenly very interested in a fight. We are too. People from Showtime, who show Khan’s fights in the US, came into the dressing room after Kell won and said “let’s talk”. Other US broadcasters have also been on - it’s exciting times.

‘I think this fight can be made, but people have to put arrogance and ego to one side. Before, when we offered Khan £3m to fight, he didn’t fancy it. Kell had a reasonable name and no title. He has a huge name and a world title now. That changes the negotiating position a lot, but this is such a big fight everyone can do well out of it, so long as Khan doesn’t demand an unrealistic split we should make it happen.

‘I want to make this fight and I think it will be huge. Maybe Floyd Mayweather will feature down the line. Kell is certainly in that reckoning now.’

Brook will return to action in Sheffield on December 6. Hearn added: ‘We will now start looking at opponents. Andre Berto, Juan Manuel Marquez, Brandon Rios, Josesito Lopez are all names being thrown in the pot but it is very early days.

‘We will talk over the options and go from there. Kell has a great future and I am so happy for him.’
