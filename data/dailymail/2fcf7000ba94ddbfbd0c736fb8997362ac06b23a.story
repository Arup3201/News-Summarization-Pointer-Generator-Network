Shaun Beverley was attacked after asking teenagers to leave his property

An architect was kicked, punched and spat on as he tried to defend his award-winning home from gatecrashers behaving with a 'pack mindset' during his daughter’s 13th birthday.

Sixty uninvited older teenagers - who spotted the party details through Facebook messages - gathered on the £1.1million home of Shaun Beverley in an exclusive private road.

In every parent's worse nightmare, they descended upon the home and refused to leave the house, which had won Mr Beverley a Home Builder of a Year award.

But when Mr Beverley told the group they had ten minutes to leave the home in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, they turned on him and inflicted horrendous injuries on the 45-year-old.

The group punched him to the floor, and then kicked, spat on and threw objects at him, District Judge Jeff Brailsford sitting at Blackpool Magistrates Court heard.

Before him was one of the attackers, a 16-year-old - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - who admitted assaulting Mr Beverley on July 7 this year.

The court heard that the youth - who was not invited to the party - threw three punches at his victim before others joined in the attack.

The judge heard that the group conned their way into Mr Beverley property which had electric gates by using an intercom giving a false identity.

They turned up at the daughter’s party because they had been alerted to it by Facebook.

The judge told the teenager: 'You were 
part of a pack mindset which led this man suffered a vicious and 
horrendous attack try to defend his home and his garden in an entirely 
proper manner.

'He was entitled to do what he he did.'

'He had opened up his home for his daughter’s party and these people wangled their way in.They were all at least two or three years older then the girl.'

'But when asked they were not for leaving. Mr Beverley started to usher them out when he was punched to the floor by you.'

The 16-year-old who attacked the father, pictured, apologised

'You became the front man and other 
egged you on.

'You are an intelligent young man and you behaved in an 
appalling manner you will forever regret what you did to this man.'

Brett Chappell, defending, said his client apologised unreservedly for what he did.

'He wants to go into the Army.

'When he was shown the photographs of the injuries suffered by an innocent man he was totally ashamed and accepts he was a catalyst for what happened.'

The youth was given a nine month referral order during which he may have to meet his victim face to face.

He must pay Mr Beverley £150 compensation and £50 court costs.

Gatecrashers looking at the social media site for details of private events have become a common problem.

In October, Graham Sumeray, chief executive of Fine and Rare Wines, and his wife, Sax, went out for dinner on Saturday evening, after allowing their 16-year-old son, Hugo, to invite some friends to the four-bedroom family home in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.

However, fifty uninvited guests turned up after spotting the invitation on Facebook and a treasured family heirloom went missing from the home.

Police and an ambulance also arrived after a fight broke out between two youths and a teenager suffered a broken nose and needed eight stitches.
