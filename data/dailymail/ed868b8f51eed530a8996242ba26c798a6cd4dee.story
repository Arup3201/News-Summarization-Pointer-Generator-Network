Oh, Sally. If only you’d sloped off home early like your husband.

Alas, it seems the lure of free champagne and a star-studded party proved too much for the irrepressible Mrs Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John.

Several hours later, her decision to stay out ended up with her dancing in the street, clambering into a cab with her underwear on show and giggling as she gestured rudely with her middle finger.

'Ladettes': Sally Bercow waves her arms in the air as she leaves the awards dinner with Farah Sassoon on Tuesday night

Her action-packed night began in a 
rather more dignified manner, as she and Mr Bercow arrived on the red 
carpet for an awards ceremony at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.

Mrs Bercow, 43, looked elegant in a purple and black dress – although it
 was difficult to miss the newly-revealed tattoo on her shoulder.

Four hours later, long after her husband had departed, the mother-of-three emerged looking distinctly worse for wear.

She
 and a friend then spent 20 minutes trying to hail a taxi. Mrs Bercow 
appeared a little unsteady on her feet, although she was happy to 
entertain bystanders with an impromptu dance.

She was also heard 
boasting about her husband, who had given a speech about code breaker 
Alan Turing at the awards ceremony, for the gay magazine Attitude.

Climbing
 into the cab, she eventually threw her remaining dignity to the wind by
 gesturing rudely with her middle finger and exposing her underwear in 
her short black skirt.

Mrs Bercow’s eventful night did not end there, 
however.

Halfway through her journey she had to change taxis after 
police were called to an altercation between her driver and another man.
 She was not involved in the dispute and no charges were pressed.

Despite
 the lateness of the hour, it is thought she and her friend went to the 
Dorchester Hotel for a nightcap instead of going straight home. In the 
early hours of yesterday, they finally turned in.

Mrs
 Bercow’s latest episode of exhibitionism came barely a week after she 
revealed her new tattoo, in front of millions of TV viewers.

She
 has had the names of her children – Jemima, five, Freddie, eight, and 
Oliver, nine – inked on her shoulder in a heart shape.

In
 2011, she infamously posed naked in a bedsheet against a backdrop of 
the Houses of Parliament. Later that year, she was accused of demeaning 
the dignity of her husband’s office by taking part in Channel 5 show 
Celebrity Big Brother.

And 
she has previously described how she was a ‘ladette’ in her 20s, 
drinking two bottles of wine a day and frequently having flings with men
 who bought her drinks.
