You're gonna need a bigger boat.

Fisherman David Flynn captured the terrifying moment a seven-foot-long hammerhead shark approached a swimmer who had just fallen off a raft at a Florida beach.

Flynn was standing on the Navarre Beach Pier on Tuesday when he filmed beachgoers frantically swim to safety as the shark advanced.

'From our vantage point, we could 
see the shark going towards a lady swimmer,' Flynn told ABC News.

'And her back was to the 
shark, and she was unaware. You can hear people screaming in the video. I
 yelled, 'Get out of the water!''

Scary: David Flynn filmed a hammerhead shark swimming toward a woman who had just fallen off a raft at Navarre Beach in Florida on Tuesday

Caught on camera: David Flynn captured this hammerhead shark, estimated to be seven-feet-long, swimming near the shoreline on Tuesday

He added: 'I've seen sharks before but I've never seen a shark get that close... It
 was almost interacting with humans.'

The video went viral after Flynn posted it to his Facebook page.

Lifeguard Colton Boney told WEAR-TV he saw a woman on the west side of the pier fall off her raft into the water as the shark approached. He ran in to save her.

'I never thought I'd be charged by a shark,' he said. 'The shark kept coming up so I put myself between her and the shark.'

He said he slowly walked backwards in the water, pulling the shaken woman toward the shore and never taking his eyes off the shark.

Boney said shark swam around for about 15 minutes before disappearing into deeper water.

Hammerheads typically swim in schools during the day along coastlines and continental shelves where the water is warm. They come solitary hunters at night.

There are nine species of hammerhead, and only three are considered dangerous, Sharks World reported.
