In a speech in Estonia, Liam Fox (file pic), called Putin's government 'bullying and thuggish' and said the West's failure to act has encouraged him

The West must take a much tougher line against Vladimir Putin - otherwise no country with a Russian population will be safe, Liam Fox warned last night.

The former Defence Secretary said Putin’s government was a ‘bullying and thuggish regime’, but David Cameron and other leaders had been weak in tackling him.

In a strongly-worded speech in Estonia, he criticised the US and Europe for doing little more than threatening to suspend Russia from the G8 group of major nations - saying it should be permanently expelled.

He also called for Nato air defences to be permanently beefed up to protect the Baltic republics, and said any planned sales of weaponry should be scrapped.

‘We must be firm in our response to this challenge to international law,’ he said. ‘This must be seen as the point where we fundamentally reassessed our attitude to the Putin government.

‘This cannot be a suspension of the G8. It must be the end of the G8 until there is a profound change in Russian behaviour.

‘The beefing up of Baltic air defences must be permanent, not temporary. Nato exercises must become more extensive and frequent and we must halt defence exports to Russia, including the 1.2billion euro French warship order.’

He added: ‘Make no mistake, this is an expansionist Russia echoing its imperialist past.’

Russia annexed the Ukrainian province of Crimea last month, and is accused of stirring up nationalist sentiment in the east of the country.

Dr Fox said the West’s failure to act against Putin in the past had encouraged him. They did little to punish him for his invasion of Georgia, or the cyber attack on Estonia - and the US failure to oppose Assad’s aggression in Syria led Putin to draw the ‘obvious’ conclusions.

‘For too long, the serial bad behaviour of Putin’s Russia has been ignored,’ he said.

‘The strong desire to see Russia develop as a pluralistic democratic society has allowed wishful thinking to take the place of critical analysis on far too many occasions.

‘What we are witnessing in Ukraine today is not a new Russian pattern of behaviour.

'We have seen a former KGB officer, who views the world in the same way the old Soviet Union did, biding his time until he perceived the balance of power tip his way and he has been well rewarded for his wait as the West fails to deliver on some of the most important issues of the day.’

He added: ‘Putin watched the reaction of the West while he bullied Ukraine over the supply and price of Russian gas and he saw that we did nothing.

‘Putin’s government is a bullying and thuggish regime. Russia has ruthlessly deployed its gas exports as a strategic weapon.

'Just as a drug dealer gets their addict hooked and can then demand any price they like, Putin had no qualms about exploiting the weakness of neighbouring energy-dependent states.’

Fox also took a swipe at Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, saying he is 'astonished and appalled' whenever a Western politician speaks of their admiration for Putin

Dr Fox said Russia was already eying up the Serb part of Bosnia, and could also seek to increase its influence in the Arctic. He also suggested Putin would use oligarchs’ money to influence elections in Russia’s near neighbours.

‘Putin has observed weak Western leadership, with electorates tired of external conflicts after Iraq and Afghanistan, neglecting their outside space and too focused on increasingly internal short-term interests,’ he said.

‘We must be firm in our response to this challenge to international law. This must be seen as the point where we fundamentally reassessed our attitude to the Putin government.’

In a swipe at Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, he said: ‘I am astonished and appalled when I hear Western politicians talk about their admiration for Putin.’
