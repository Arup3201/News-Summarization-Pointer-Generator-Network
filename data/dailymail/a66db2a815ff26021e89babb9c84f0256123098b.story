For more than 50 years, motorists have stopped at Little Chef’s roadside restaurants for a break and a fry-up. But the chain’s chubby cook mascot could disappear from Britain’s A-roads.

McDonald’s, KFC and Burger King are among those bidding to take over the chain this week. Potential buyers for all or part of Little Chef also include British coffee shop chain Costa.

Little Chef has been put up for sale by owner Rcapital. The private equity firm claimed it had ‘a deep affection for the Little Chef brand’ and wanted to find a buyer prepared to keep chef mascot Charlie as a familiar sight beside Britain’s main roads.

However, the firm said it was resigned to the fact that this would be unlikely, adding: ‘The majority of the offers for Little Chef are from companies that may want to re-brand the estate.’

The chain is expected to be sold by late summer and may be split up between two or more buyers.

Little Chef, which employs 1,100 staff, opened its first restaurant in Reading in 1958. But its popularity waned thanks to changing tastes and competition from food sales on petrol forecourts.

Rcapital bought it in 2007, pared down the number of restaurants from 200 to 80 and tried to overhaul the menu in partnership with celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal.

The revamp was featured in a Channel 4 documentary, Big Chef takes on Little Chef.

The chain peaked in the eighties 
after it took over its main rival Happy Eater in 1986, with more than 
230 branches across the UK.

As the restaurants struggled to keep going, they have been run by six different owners in the past 30 years.

The group’s mascot, ‘Fat Charlie,’ 
entered the social media age this year, taking to Twitter to urge 
Britons to breakfast at Little Chef, but he has attracted fewer than 
3,000 followers.
