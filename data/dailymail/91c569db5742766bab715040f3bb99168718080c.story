Wiltshire chief constable Patrick Geenty is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over the way his force handled allegations of sexual abuse

A chief constable is being investigated by the police watchdog over the way his force handled allegations of sexual abuse, it emerged today.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating Wiltshire Police chief constable Patrick Geenty, as well as an inspector and detective constable from the force, which last week was criticised for letting sex offenders off if they apologised to their victims.

It is alleged they witheld information from complainants about the extent of the force's failings in dealing with the sexual abuse claims.

The IPCC investigation relates to the way the force dealt with complaints about a sexual abuse investigation in 2008-20010. 

Police and Crime Commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon, Angus Macpherson, confirmed the matter was referred to the IPCC after he was sent a letter of complaint.

He said: 'This letter was with regard to the way in which a previous complaint had been dealt with by the force between 2008-10.

'That complaint was in relation to the way a case of historic sexual abuse had been managed.

'Following an initial meeting with IPCC investigators, my office is now in consultation with the IPCC on the matter.'

He added: 'Deputy Chief Constable Mike Veale has made referrals to the IPCC in relation to the conduct of two other officers who were also involved in the handling of the 2008 complaint.' 

It is also alleged that Mr Geenty, who was then assistant chief constable, also withheld information and misled the complainants.

Sarah Green, IPCC deputy chairman, added: 'It is vital that the public are confident that police forces will take their complaints seriously and act with honesty and integrity.

'Our investigation will seek to establish whether information was knowingly withheld and whether these complainants were knowingly and dishonestly misled.'

Mr Geenty, a former secondary school teacher who joined the police service in 1982, said: 'I am shocked by the allegation that I attempted to mislead a complainant. 

'I welcome an open and transparent investigation and the public deserve no less.' 

Last week Wiltshire Police was criticised by victims charities for failing to send a clear message to sex offenders after it emerged that rapists and child abusers were being allowed to walk free if they apologised to their victims.

New figures showed that some criminals accused of sexual offences, including rapists, were being handed community resolution orders rather than custodial sentences.

The orders are often used to punish youths so they do not get a criminal record and usually involve the offender making a verbal or written apology to their victim.
