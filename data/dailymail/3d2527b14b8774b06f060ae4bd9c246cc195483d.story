In his hey-day popstar Rod Stewart had thousands of girls screaming and crying at his concerts.

And years later his emotive power still prevails as a little girl cries and laughs when her mother sings one of his 1988 hits to her.

A video capturing the moment was posted on YouTube and shows the 10-month-old baby going through a range of emotions as her mother sings My Heart Can't Tell You No.

Mixed emotions: A video has appeared online of a 10-month-old baby both smiling and crying as her mother sings My Heart Can't Tell You No

The two-minute clip which was posted last week is gaining in popularity and has already had thousands of views.

It starts with the smiling baby sitting in a baby chair as her mother asks: 'Do you want mummy to sing a song? Let me know how you feel about this song.'

As the mother begins to sing the baby looks bemused and then breaks into a wide smile as she continues.

Salty tears round down her cheeks into her mouth and she pauses as she tastes them

Emotional: Her eyes start to fill up with tears and she starts to look upset, raising her hand to her face

But just as suddenly she then smiles widely and looks as if she is enjoying the song again

But then her eyes start to fill up with tears and her face grimaces.

The little girl then raises her eyebrows as she looks more emotional as her mother continues to sing.

Salty tears round down her cheeks into her mouth and she pauses to tastes them before looking more distraught.

But just as suddenly she then smiles widely and looks as if she is enjoying the song again.

When the mother finishes and tells the little girl 'It's just a song,' she then laughs contently.

One user wrote under the video: 'Absolutely beautiful! She is precious. I remember doing something similar, but I wasn't as young as ten months, probably more﻿ like two years. My mom would sing me lullabies in bed and I would just cry and cry because I was overwhelmed by it all.'

While another user wrote: 'I think she was reacting more to the mother's facial expressions﻿ rather than to whatever the song was about.'
