You may only know of the Romanovs through watching ‘Anastasia’ but the Russian royal family owned some seriously stylish ornaments.

To the Tsars of old, Easter eggs weren’t made of chocolate but were beautifully crafted Fabergé pieces with gold and precious stones.

An exhibition of 240 Fabergé objects will be on display exclusively in the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Canada, the largest collection outside of Russia from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond.

Intricate pieces: A Faberge egg  decorated with a portrait of Peter the Great was given by Tsar Nicholas II to his wife, made by Mikhail Perkhin in 1903

The exhibition ‘Fabergé, Jeweller to the Tsars’, running from June 14 to October 5, will include four of the last 43 Fabergé eggs that were commissioned by the Romanovs.

Carl Fabergé, who lived from 1846 to 1920, was a Russian jeweller whose name has become synonymous with these beautiful and ornate objects, as well as luxury jewellery.

As well as showcasing his stunning works, the exhibition will explain the history and traditions of Orthodox Russia and the techniques of the House of Fabergé, which fell with the Tsarist regime.

The jewelled and glittering exhibits include enamelled picture frames, gold jewellery encrusted with precious stones, miniature animals carved from precious stones, rock-crystal flower vases and silverware.

Precious: The exhibition includes gold flowers a brooch made from gold, garnet, rubies and diamonds

The star pieces of the exhibition will be  a small hard-stone portrait of a sailor from the imperial yacht Zarnitsa, a rare portrait of Tsar Nicholas II in a column shaped frame, and a portrait of the Grand Duchess Tatiana, second daughter of the last Tsar, thought to be the last artefact of the imperial family before their tragic murder.

Dr. Géza von Habsburg, conservation director of the Fabergé Company based in London, said 'With its five imperial eggs, the Fabergé collection of the Virginia Museum of Art is the largest of its kind outside of Russia. 'Its eggs, four of which are travelling to Montreal, are some of the greatest masterpieces ever created by Fabergé, who was, according to connoisseurs, the world’s most famous goldsmith'.

Fabergé is best known for his mastery of enamelled decoration, and the exhibition will reveal the full extent of his productions, from cloisonné enamelled Russian goblets to Western decorated cigarette boxes, walking canes and photo frames.

But his most famous legacy is his intricate eggs, mainly created for the Tsar of Russia, each containing a very special surprise inside.

One of the four eggs on display is the Tsarevitch imperial Easter egg, made in 1912 by master goldsmith Henrik Wigström.

A present for the Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, it consists of six sections of lapis lazuli decorated with golden two- headed eagles and splays of flowers, with a diamond monogram of the Russian letters AF.

Inside is a miniature portrait of Tsarevitch Alexi, the son of Tsar Nicholas II and Alexandra

Tsarina Alexandra was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, making her an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth II.

Nathalie Bondil, the MMFA’s Director and Chief Curator, says “This first major exhibition on Fabergé to be shown in Canada is a unique opportunity to discover the splendour of the decorative arts of the House of Fabergé, whose fate was tragically linked to the history and fall of the imperial house of Russia in 1917.

The jeweller’s symbolic significance and artistry still exert their fascination, from the dollar princesses of yesteryear to the oligarch tsars of today who collect them.’
