John Edwards' eldest daughter has revealed that she sees his love child at Christmas but has no relationship with his former mistress.

In a frank interview, Cate Edwards said she sees her half-sister Frances Quinn less often than she sees her parents' younger children but that she's interested in having a good relationship with her.

'I saw her at Christmas,' she told the Washington Post. 'She’s down there in Charlotte, [North Carolina]. It’s not as easy.'

When asked if she had any relationship with Rielle Hunter, who had an affair with her father while her mother was battling cancer, she promptly responded: 'No.'

Scandal: Cate Edwards, left with her father after he was found not guilty of misusing campaign funds in 2012, said she wants a relationship with his daughter Francis Quinn, right with her mother Rielle Hunter

Cate 
Edwards, an Ivy-league educated lawyer who now works with her father, 
has long stood by his side - through the revelations about his affair 
and his court battle, which found him not guilty of misusing campaign 
funds to cover up the relationship.

Friends of Cate explained to The Washington Post that anyone's shock at the 
support John Edwards receives from his daughter needs to understand 
this time in their lives.

When Cate was 14, her older brother Wade was killed in a car crash in 1996. Cate 
recalled her parents falling apart in the aftermath of their eldest son's
 death - so much so that Cate moved into their bedroom to console them.

'For
 them, the worst had already happened,' says Sunjung Kim, Cate’s 
roommate for four years at Princeton. 'Everything that came after was 
just something to be dealt with.'

Cate told The Washington Post
 that she wouldn't discuss her mother and father's marriage but that 
Wade's death was integral to her relationship with her father.

Presidential campaign: John 
Edwards with his family in January 2008, with his wife Elizabeth and
 children Emma Claire, Jack and Cate. At this time 
Elizabeth knew of the affair - but thought it was a 
one-night stand

'I’m really not going to get into their relationship,' said Cate. 'In terms 
of my relationship with the two of them, when you’ve been through the 
things we’ve been through together, this wasn’t like losing Wade. It was
 not as bad.'

Edwards, a former vice-president candidate, had met Rielle Hunter on February 21, 2006 when she walked into the bar at Lowes 
Regency Hotel in New York and told him, 'You're so 
hot!'

Their
 disastrous affair was discovered by Elizabeth in December 2006 - two years after her cancer diagnosis - but at 
the time Edwards told 
his cancer-stricken wife it was a one-night stand.

Speaking with the Post, Ivy-league 
educated Cate, who has since set up a law firm with her father, revealed
 the moment she found out about the affair. Her father broke the news to
 her in 2007 or 2008 - she can't remember which - just before it hit the
 tabloids.

'It
 was important from dad's perspective to be honest with me,' she said in
 the interview, which was held to celebrate her new partnership with her
 father on his successful return to practicing law.

'He
 was very emotional in telling me...We hugged and I said, 'I love you'. 
That's generally how it went. He was, he was upset,' said Cate.

Tragedy: Edwards leaves his wife's funeral with his children Jack (C) and Cate (R) in December 2010

In August 
2008, the news emerged that Edwards had fathered a child with his 
one-time aide, Rielle Hunter and his campaign to become president 
imploded - as did his marriage to Elizabeth, after Christmas, one year 
later.

On
 December 7, 2010, days after Cate, now 32, was engaged to her college 
sweetheart Tevor Upham, her mother passed away after battling cancer for
 almost six years.

In 2012 her father came close to prison during his trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws, but Cate stood by him.

She
 stood by him even after the revelation during that trial of the 
harrowing moment her mother ripped open her blouse to show Edwards her 
breast cancer surgery scars after The National Enquirer first reported 
his affair in October 2007.

'I had my moments of self-pity,' she said. 'I've never reacted with anger exactly. I mean, you know I was 
angry at my dad for a while. We worked on, we worked very hard to repair
 our relationship.'

The
 politician made headlines again in April, when he and Cate were turned 
away when he tried to get into socialite Bunny Mellon's funeral in 
Virginia.

Focal point: The death of Wade Edwards in 1996 bonded Cate, her father and mother in a way that only those who have gone through something similar can appreciate according to her friends

The
 financial relationship between the disgraced politician and the 
reclusive heiress nearly twice his age was made public during the former
 Senator's 2011 trial which delved into the alleged misuse of the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars that Mellon gave to Edward's campaign.

Though he 
was found not guilty of illegally using the more than $700,000 Mellon 
donated, he has apparently not won back the support of the now-deceased 
socialite's family.

Bunny, whose real name was Rachel Lambert Mellon, died from natural causes on March 17 at the age of 103.

The
 New York Post reports that Edwards showed up to Mellon's funeral in 
Upperville, Virginia on Friday with his eldest daughter Cate but they 
were given the cold shoulder.

When
 they arrived, they were kept out of the service at Trinity Episcopal 
Church and forced to stand in an adjacent parish with the rest of the 
overflow crowd.
