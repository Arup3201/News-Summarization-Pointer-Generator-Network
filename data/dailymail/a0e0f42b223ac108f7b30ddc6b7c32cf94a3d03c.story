These colourful pieces of street art have been appearing in a growing number of locations across south east London.

Two graffiti artists have painted a series of bright murals on phone and electricity boxes across the area.

The brightly coloured illustrations 
include depictions of local landmarks and references to iconic pieces of
 literature, such as The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer.

Justin Thomas, who took the photos of the artworks, said: 'I noticed all these really bright illustrations kept appearing across parts of mainly south east London.

'I started to notice more and more of these distinctive images cropping up - mainly on phone boxes and electrical boxes.

'They really stood out so I started taking pictures of them. They're impressive looking and they really seem to brighten up the surroundings.'

One of the artists goes only by the name 'mORGANICo' and, similarly to Banksy, does not reveal his or her real name. He painted the murals in collaboration with another street artist, Steven Ball.

The project was part of a project called Cleaner Greener Safer, run by Southwark Council, to improve run down areas of the borough.
