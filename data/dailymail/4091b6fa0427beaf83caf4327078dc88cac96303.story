It’s one of the biggest court cases the U.S. has seen in recent decades, so there were plenty of pictures taken of Casey Anthony as she sat in court and got led out of jail two months ago.

But it turns out the 25-year-old is doing some snapping of herself while in hiding in northern Florida, taking pictures of landscapes and wildlife - as far away from other people as possible in the state.

She is an avid photographer and is taking online courses, while also learning a foreign language because she may leave the U.S. once her probation is up next year, sources told People magazine.

She was described by a Department of Corrections spokesman as ‘one of the most hated women in America’ following her acquittal on charges of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee.

Anthony told an Orange County jail guard she had considered dentistry, fashion and law as career options - but did not like enjoy media outlets choosing the ‘ugliest pictures of her’, reported People.

Last month on August 9, she received a batch of birthday cards on the day when Caylee would have turned six. They looked quite normal on the outside but were filled inside with hateful messages.

‘Caylee will never be six because of you, you horrible bitch,’ one hand-scratched message said.

She is currently in hiding while on probation for cheque fraud. ‘She would love to go out to meet friends and do public things but she knows she can’t,’ one source in contact with her told People.

Another source told People: ‘There are people out there who would like nothing more than to beat her up - or worse’. She has also been seeing a psychiatrist and grief counsellor.

Mr Anthony said he is unlikely to ever speak to his daughter again after being so hurt by allegations put to him during the trial that he sexually abused her as a child. He denied the claims.

But Mrs Anthony has always held the belief that Caylee drowned and her daughter knew where the toddler was buried and may have had help placing her body there.

Caylee was the focus of a wide-ranging search after her disappearance in June 2008. Casey Anthony told police that a fictitious babysitter had kidnapped the child.

The 25-year-old maintained the same story to her family until the child's skeletal remains were found in a wooded area in December 2008 not far from the home of George and Cindy Anthony.

During her trial prosecutors argued that Casey Anthony killed the girl by smothering her with duct tape and later buried her to hide the body.

But defence lawyers suggested Caylee died from an accidental drowning in a backyard swimming pool. She was acquitted in July, but convicted of four charges of lying to police.

She is currently somewhere in northern Florida serving a year of probation on a separate check fraud conviction. Authorities are keeping her whereabouts confidential for her safety.

Despite her acquittal, Casey Anthony has been scorned by the public, and her parents - who at times have defended her - have not fared much better in popular opinion.

Cindy Anthony said that while she believes her granddaughter drowned, she didn't believe defence attorney Jose Baez's assertion that George Anthony was there or helped cover up the death.
