Half of all violent attacks last year were fuelled by alcohol – with pub closing time on a Friday night accounting for one in three assaults.

Of the 1.3million violent crimes reported in England and Wales last year, some 53 per cent were booze related, figures released by the Office for National Statistics revealed.

The figures also showed that most booze-fuelled crime took place between 11pm to 1am on a Friday night - when 31 per cent of all assaults took place.

Men are far more likely to be victims of alcohol-related violence  – with six out of 10 attacks on men.

Two-thirds of violence between strangers also involved alcohol, while one-third of domestic violence occurred after drinking, the figures revealed.

Eight out of 10 violent incidents were alcohol-related between 10pm and midnight, whereas booze only played a part in half the violent attacks earlier in the evening, between 6pm and 10pm.

The trend continued into the early hours - with alcohol featuring in 84 per cent of all violent incidents between midnight and 6am.

According to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, violent incidents at the weekend were twice as likely to involve alcohol as during the week.

Andrew Brown, director of policy with charity DrugScope, said: ‘Today’s statistics on alcohol-related violence show the extent of the problem, with more than half of all violent incidents involving alcohol.

‘DrugScope’s state of the sector report, published today, found that almost half of substance misuse services are seeing an increased demand for alcohol treatment. We also know that every £1 invested in alcohol treatment saves £5 in health, care and criminal justice costs.

‘Making sure that people who need treatment are able to get it must be an important part of the response to alcohol-related violence.’

Analysis of the ONS statistics showed 13 per cent of all threats to kill offences involved alcohol, while some 43 per cent of assaults on police officers occurred after drinking.

Home Secretary Theresa May has welcomed falling crime figures - including an 18 per cent fall in alcohol related crime

Separate analysis showed the number of incidents involving  alcohol had dropped by more than 150,000 between 2012/13 and last year.

There were 704,000 such incidents reported in the latest batch of annual figures - the lowest in two decades.

A spokesman for the Portman group, which represents alcohol producers, said: ‘It is good news that alcohol-related violent crime has fallen by 18 per cent in just one year.

‘But alcohol-related harms still remain and some areas suffer more than others. The best way to support these communities is to get local businesses, police, local authorities and health services working together to improve town centres, tackle harmful drinking and make our high streets safer places to enjoy.'
