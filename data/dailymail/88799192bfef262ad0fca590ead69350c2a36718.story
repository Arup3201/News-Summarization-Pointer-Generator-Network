Two Russian Ambassadors have reportedly been caught boasting about annexing Scotland in a leaked recording following Vladimir Putin's lightning takeover of Crimea.

The recording of an expletive-laden conversation said to be between Igor Chubarov, the ambassador to Eritrea, and Sergei Bakharev, the ambassador to Zimbabwe and Malawi, surfaced on YouTube earlier this week.

The two men are heard boasting about invading areas with independence movements around the world including Scotland, Alaska, Catalonia and Venice.

And they even suggest London and Miami as potential target for Russian troops.

After congratulating Mr Bakharev on persuading Zimbabwe to back Russiaâ€™s takeover of Crimea at the UN, the voice, said to be that of Mr Chubarov, jokes about future conquests.

He says: 'We've got Crimea, but that's not f****** all folks. In the future we'll damn well take your Catalonia and Venice, and also Scotland and Alaska.

Chubarov then suggests Russia should make a move for 'all those f****** border countries', presumably referring to Estonia, Romania and Bulgaria.

But the two men later agree it would be better to leave Bulgaria, Romania and the 'Baltic s***' in the EU, with Bakharev saying it would be more interesting to go for California or Miami.

'Exactly, Miamiland is f****** 95 per cent Russian citizens,' says Chubarov, adding: 'We have a full right to hold a referendum'.

Bakharev responds by suggesting holding a referendum in 'Londonland', at which the men both break out in laughter.

It is thought the leaking of the conversation is in revenge for leaked conversations between western diplomats including one in which US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, seen here with Ukrainian opposition leaders is heard to say 'f*** the EU'

It is thought that the leaking of the recording is revenge for leaks of Western diplomats discussing the annexing of Crimea, including one in which US assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, is heard saying 'f*** the EU'.

Maria Zakharova, deputy spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, claimed the recording was 'clumsy US handiwork'.

Writing on Facebook she said she had no idea who it was talking on the tape, but said the attached photograph of Bakharev bore no resemblance to him.
