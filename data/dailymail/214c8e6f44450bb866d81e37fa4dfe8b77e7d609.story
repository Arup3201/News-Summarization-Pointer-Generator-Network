Sam Burgess has really bought into his switch from rugby league to union - making the trip to Twickenham to watch England against Australia the day after  his debut in the sport for Bath.

The former South Sydney Rabbitohs star was pictured at Twickenham in the crowd with girlfriend Phoebe Hooke.

And he seemed to enjoy what he was witnessing as he bore a huge smile - and even made sure to share a kiss with his girlfriend.

The 25-year-old made an unexpectedly early debut for Bath during their 25-6 victory over Harlequins on Friday night.

He came on as a replacement with 17 minutes remaining in the centre and made a few nice carries, as well as clearing out a ruck well.

Burgess has been talked about as a potential inside centre for England and believes he will concentrate on playing in that position for the time-being.
