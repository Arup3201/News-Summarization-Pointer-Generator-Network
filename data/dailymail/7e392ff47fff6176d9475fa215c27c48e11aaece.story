But they showed no remorse, with one even shouting at his victim’s 93-year-old mother: ‘Eleven years? I’ll do it standing on my head.’

Marcus Bristow, 32, taunted her as he was led down to the cells after being sentenced for the manslaughter of father-of-one Julian Gardner, 52.

Guilty: Brothers Terrence (left) and Marcus (right) Bristow were found guilty of the manslaughter of Julian Gardner at Lewes Crown Court

Tragic: Julian Gardner with his baby. Mr Gardner was killed when a gang stole his Land Rover and used it to crush him to death against another vehicle

He and brother Terence, 42, have 45 
previous convictions between them and led a gang of travellers who went 
to Mr Gardner’s vehicle repair workshop to steal tools in 2010.

When he disturbed them, they ran him 
down using his own Land Rover at Bush Barn Farm, near Robertsbridge, 
East Sussex, where he lived with his mother.

Judge Scott-Gall said: ‘Julian 
Gardner was a decent, honourable, hard-working man who was killed in a 
ghastly manner for doing no more than trying to protect burglars from 
stealing his property.

Guilty: It took jurors three days to convict the Bristow brothers along with Paul Dunn (left) and Lee Delay (right) for manslaughter

‘Nothing can reverse the effect this 
has had on the family. As they have sat throughout this entire trial, 
they have not seen or heard a flicker of remorse.’

Two other men in the gang based at a 
travellers’ site in Ashford, Kent, were convicted of manslaughter and 
three others for less serious offences.

During sentencing, it emerged that 
Terence Bristow had 34 previous convictions, some for theft and 
violence, dating back to when he was just 11.

The court heard Julian Gardner was run down by the gang between this Land Rover and another vehicle.

Six months before he killed Mr 
Gardner, the thug was released from prison on licence after serving half
of a six-year sentence for another violent burglary.

His brother had 11 previous 
convictions, including for burglary and theft. The gang, whose sentences
totalled 45 years, had more than 80 previous convictions between them.

In a statement after the case at 
Lewes Crown Court, their victim’s mother Molly and his sister Anna 
Murphy said: ‘They will be released from their sentence.

Jailed: Lee Delay, 23 (left) and Paul Dunn, 33, were jailed for seven years each for their part in the burglary

Also given prison terms were Christopher Leek, 30 (left) and Oliver Payne, 25, who were convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Paul Dunn¿s father, Terrence Dunn, 57, was the final gang member, and received 18 months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

‘We, as Julian’s family, will never 
be released from our sorrow. Our Julian was above all a good and decent 
man who worked hard all his life.’

His business partner, Damien Porter, 
who found his body, broke down in tears and said: ‘They should have been
sent down for longer.’

Mr Gardner had a son with his partner who is now three but was only 18 months old when he died.

The Bristow brothers were the 'prime 
movers' in a gang who were sentenced for a combined 45 years, with four 
convicted for manslaughter and the remaining three for less serious 
offences.

Also jailed for those charges were 
Paul Dunn, 33, from Cranbrook, and Lee Delay, 23, from Tunbridge Wells, 
who got seven years each.

Oliver Payne, 25, from Tunbridge 
Wells, was jailed for three years and Christopher Leek, 30, from 
Cranbrook, was jailed for four-and-a-half after being convicted of 
conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to pervert the course of 
justice.

Paul Dunn’s father, Terrence Dunn, 57, of Sandhurst, Kent, received 18 months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Christopher Leek was the only gang member with a clean criminal record.
