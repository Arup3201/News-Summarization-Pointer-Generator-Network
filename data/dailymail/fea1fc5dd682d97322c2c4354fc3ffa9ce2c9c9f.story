Dramatic video footage has emerged showing an enormous group of sharks in a feeding frenzy off the US coast.

Video taken from high up on an oil platform captured hundreds of the predators circling 30 miles from the shores of Grand Isle, Louisiana.

Exerts believe the sharks were following shoals of fish and migrating to warmer waters after a winter in the south.

The footage was taken by a worker on an oil platform 70ft above the surface and shows the massive gathering as the camera pans from left to right.

Marine biologist and film maker Ellen Husain told MailOnline that the sharks are likely to have been spinners, found in the Gulf of Mexico, and known for migrating north in large numbers up the Florida coast at this time of year.

She added: 'You can also get a few other sharks mixed in with them, like hammerheads and blacktips.'
