Lord Hill has been nominated  to be the UK's next European Commissioner

A millionaire Tory peer is in line for a £25,000 pay-off from the taxpayer after being plucked from obscurity by David Cameron to become Britain’s new man in Brussels.

Lord Hill of Oareford was handed the £210,000-a-year job as Britain’s next EU Commissioner this week as part of the Prime Minister’s reshuffle.

The former Leader of the House of Lords has proved a controversial choice, with observers saying he lacks the profile needed to secure a top post in the Commission - and critics saying his past as a senior lobbyist raises questions about his suitability.

Although Lord Hill is moving from one well-paid taxpayer-funded job to another, Government rules mean he automatically qualifies for a tax-free ‘golden goodbye’ payment worth £25,259.

A string of other ministers leaving the Government also qualify for pay-offs, totalling almost £180,000 following Mr Cameron’s wide-ranging reshuffle. The final total will be well over £200,000 when payments to their advisers are included.

The payments result from rules that mean ministers and their special advisers are entitled to three months’ ‘redundancy’ pay when they lose their jobs – even if they asked to go.

Critics described the payments as a waste of money – and urged wealthy ministers to hand them back.

Dia Chakravarty, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be astonished to find their hard-earned cash is being wasted on golden goodbyes to ex-ministers, particularly at a time when the government keeps talking about wanting to make savings in the public sector.’

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘None of them should get anything, in particular Lord Hill who is going to a hugely salaried job in Europe. They should do what the rest of the country is doing and tighten their belts. In many cases these payments are rewards for failure.

‘The honourable thing to do would be not to take a penny. Then the whole system should be scrapped to prevent a repeat.’

Mr Cameron’s reshuffle led to the biggest clear out of ministers since the election. Some 15 former ministers, some of them extremely wealthy, are entitled to tax-free payments to cushion the blow of losing office.

Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve is entitled to £23,943 after being booted out. Cabinet casualties Owen Paterson and David Jones will each receive £17,206.

Baronet Sir George Young, who quit his post as Chief Whip voluntarily, is one of eight senior Tories entitled to payments of £8,250 each. Others include Kenneth Clarke, former Science Minister David Willetts and former Commons leader Andrew Lansley, who is already being lined up by Mr Cameron for a top job with the United Nations.

The row follows controversy over revelations that Mr Cameron is to hand knighthoods to a number of ministers who agreed to go quietly. Former Foreign Office minister Hugh Robertson, former international development minister Alan Duncan and former solicitor general Oliver Heald are all expected to receive knighthoods. Mr Clarke, 74, will be made a Companion of Honour – one of Britain’s most prestigious honours.

The Cabinet Office said ministers were entitled to pay-offs under legislation dating back to 1991. The payments are made automatically. A spokesman said it was ‘a matter for individuals’ whether they want to waive the payments or donate them to good causes.

The rules mean ministers are entitled to a payment equal to three months of their ministerial salary when they leave office.
