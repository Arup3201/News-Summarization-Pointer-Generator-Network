Housemates of a Peeping Tom are fearful their landlord may strike again if he isn't punished and locked up in jail for filming them secretly in their bathroom.

Tristan Wootton was sentenced a minimum two years behind bars last December for installing an elaborate hidden-camera system in an air vent of his home, which he then shared with two other females.

But the Central Coast electrician, from north of Sydney, is trying avoid jail time by appealing for his sentence to be reduced to home detention.

The ironically camera-shy landlord ran from A Current Affair when he was questioned for his shameful actions.

Victims Amy and Natina feel violated and traumatised by the whole ordeal.

'You feel disgusted, you think that it'll never happen to you but it does,' Natina told A Current Affair.

The palm-size camera was found by Amy in the bathroom ceiling. When she called police, they then discovered the cables led to Wootton's garage.

She says Wootton should suffer behind bars - where he belongs.

'He needs to have his rights taken away from him like I had mine,' Amy said.

'He needs to be taught a lesson and home detention is not going to teach him anything.'

Amy says she hasn't been able to move on with her life.

'I need to put this behind me and I need him to be put away for that to happen,' she said.

While Wootton has been convicted for the crime, he is currently out on bail and the District Court judge has ordered that he be assessed for home detention suitability.

'I would be pleading to the judge about how he would deal with this situation if it was his family member, his daughter, his niece, his mother or his wife,' Amy said.

A decision is expected to be handed down in November.
