The auction house Christie's is selling a rare fragment of femur bone from the extinct dodo.

The bone, estimated to be worth between £10,000 and £15,000, is thought to be the first belonging to a dodo to come to auction since 1934.

The bird was first recorded by Dutch sailors in 1598 on the island of Mauritius.  By the late 17th century, less than 100 years later, it had been hunted into extinction by humans.

The dodo bone is one of the few pieces of the extinct bird in private hands

James Hyslop, Head of Travel, Science and Natural History, at Christie's, said: 'As an icon of extinction, the dodo is second to none. From its appearance in Alice in Wonderland to the expression ‘dead as a dodo’, the bird has cemented its place in our cultural heritage.

'This exciting discovery is one of the few pieces of dodo material in private hands, and it is a privilege, and humbling experience, to have been entrusted with the bone.

'It is a reminder of the effect humans have on the natural world, and presents a rare opportunity to engage with this now lost and most enigmatic bird.'

Scientists have met to discuss the possibility of bringing back 24 animals back from extinction

But a real life Jurassic Park is not an option, it is said, because dinosaur DNA is just too old. 

The so called 'de-extinction' of a number of species was discussed at a TEDx conference in Washington DC sponsored by National Geographic.

They included the dodo bird, the Elephant Bird, last seen in 1904 in Florida, and the Quagga, a plains zebra which once lived in South Africa.

The last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883, the Journal reports.

The teams chose the animals using a number of criteria, and discussed the ethics of bringing them back to life. 

Another marvel of the natural world, is also in the sale - a fossilised egg from the Elephant Bird (Aepyornis maximus) -  measuring more than 100 times the average size of a chicken egg.

The extinct Elephant Bird, a native of Madagascar, was the largest bird ever to have lived.

The egg - expected to reach between £20,000 to £30,000 stands at 8¾ inches (21cm) in diameter and 12 inches (30cm) in height.

Similar in stature to a heavily-built ostrich with long legs and talons, it grew to around 11 to 10 feet in height and is thought to have been hunted to extinction in Madagascar between the 14th and 17th centuries.

Fragments of eggs can be found in the Southern part of the island, but whole examples such as the the lot to be sold by Christie's are extremely rare.

Also forming part of the lot is a recently discovered fine view of Port Louis, Mauritius, a lost work by William Hodges - the  official artist on Captain Cook’s second voyage around the world during the 1770s. This lost Mauritius painting probably dates from his voyage home from Hodges tour of India in 1785 and could fetch up to £100,000.

A 1939 enigma machine, widely used during World War II to encrypt and decode messages sent between the German military and their commanders, is also estimated to reach £60,000.
