On realising he had become £8million richer overnight, Ron Elliot could have been forgiven for taking the weekend off to reflect on his life-changing win.

But the morning after becoming a Lotto multi-millionaire, the care home employee was up at 6am to go to work – because ‘the old folk need me’.

The 67-year-old, who won his prize on Saturday with a Lucky Dip ticket, said: ‘My clients have dementia and suffer from memory loss. They don’t care that I’ve won the lottery and they still need care.’

Ron Elliot still plans to carry on working at a Surrey care home, despite his Lotto windfall of nearly £8million

That's a big cheque: Mr Elliot poses up with a glass of bubbly and proof of his winnings - £7,959,312

Explaining his decision to not even take a day off from his £15,000-a-year job, he added: ‘The residents are 90 years old.'

'I have to give them their breakfast, do their laundry and do the housework. Because you work with old people who rely on you, you can’t just take time off.'

In a way, Mr Elliot has the residents of the care home to thank for his win. He was actually on the way to work when he decided to pop in to a newsagents and buy the Lucky Dip ticket. 

Mr Elliot says he will use his £7,959,312 winnings to buy a house and go on holiday to Indonesia.

He is also making arrangements to pay off his son’s mortgage and is considering attending next year’s World Cup in Brazil.

To celebrate he said he was planning to have a few pints of lager at his local pub with friends.

But he has no plans to retire from the care home, saying: ‘I find it a satisfying job. Now I’m in a position where I could leave but I want to carry on.’

Mr Elliot, from Sutton, Surrey, says he wants to pay for a Christmas treat for the residents of the care home where he works up to 60 hours a week.

The grandfather-of-two said: ‘I would like to see them have a good Christmas, if we can arrange something.’

Mr Elliot is a widower and has lived alone for 40 years since his wife died in a car crash just a year after they were married.

He was at home in the two-bedroom maisonette he shares with a housemate when he saw the lottery results on Saturday, adding: ‘I had no idea how big it was. I found out on Sunday just how much I had won.’

Winning numbers: Mr Elliot is planning a party, a holiday and some generous gifts for family and friends - perhaps even a trip to the World Cup in Brazil
