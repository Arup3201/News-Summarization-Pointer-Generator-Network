She is the British textile 
designer whose bold prints and collaborations with Ossie Clark have cemented her work as some of the most iconic and memorable of the 60s and 70s.

And now Celia Birtwell has teamed up with  Uniqlo to create a capsule collection full of her 
signature
colourful prints.

Celia’s famous archive prints have been re-imagined, re-scaled, 
re-worked and re-coloured into an exclusive range of T-shirts, tunic 
vests, shirts, jeggings, pyjama pants, culottes, and tote bags.

She's back! Celia Birtwell's famous archive prints have been re-imagined and re-scaled into an exclusive range of t-shirts, tunic vests, shirts, jeggings, pyjama pants, culottes, and tote bags for Japanese label Uniqlo

Celia follows the lead of Lula Guinness, Orla Kiely and Laura Ashley, who have all worked with the Japanese brand.

She was chosen for
her ability 'to combine the traditional sensitivity toward prints with a
contemporary, modern and unique twist' which she told MailOnline she has achieved by taking the label through her archives.

Famous prints: Celia flew to Japan and took Uniqlo through her print archives and they chose a lot of her homewear prints

'Most things in my life just come along. There was interest a couple of years ago but I was very well looked after this time and it really grew into something.

'I flew to Japan and we selected 
several prints, particularly from my home collection, which I never 
thought you could use but I am surprised and delighted with everything,'
she said.

This isn't the first time that Celia 
has teamed up with a high street brand. Her 11-piece range for Topshop 
in 2006 sold out within minutes and she is hoping for the same success 
with Uniqlo.

Pleased: Celia is very pleased with how everything has worked out and she hopes it has great success

'I am very pleased with it but you never dare get beyond yourself, I really hope it will be a success.

'I am feeling very confident and I don't normally say that but it looks very good,' she revealed.

Celia's skillfully juxtaposed prints have clothed celebrities through the 
decades and furnish interiors through a contemporary textiles line.

Famous duo: Celia was married to dress designer Raymond Ossie Clark who died in 1996

She thoroughly enjoyed working with Uniqlo and described them as 'very supportive and extremely nice to work with.'

'I have always liked Oriental designs and they are close to my heart so really inspired me.'

And while the 71-year-old is busy with her current project, she already has her sights firmly set on the future.

'I have nothing set in stone but I have a few ideas of what I want to do. It keeps me busy and that's why I like it.'

Her collection launches in the UK on 21 March and starts from £9.90 and on the US site.
