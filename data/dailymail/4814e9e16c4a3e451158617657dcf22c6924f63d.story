Tourists are risking their lives by climbing onto and swimming near crocodile traps in order to get a picture.

National parks authorities have slammed the behaviour of one man, pictured in a cowboy hat, who was spotted wading into water near the entrance of a croc trap in Kakadu, Northern Territory and posing with his thumbs up on Sunday.

In a post on the Parks Australia blog, National Park operations manager Anthony Contarino shared the pictures taken by a Jim Jim Falls tour guide to warn tourists against 'tempting fate'.

'After two terrible tragedies this year, these are the kind of pictures that have every ranger's heart in their mouth,' he wrote.

'This is beyond dangerous, and goes against our constant croc safety messages.

'We want people to come to Kakadu, enjoy the park and be safe while they are here.

'Tempting fate by swimming in an area where a crocodile trap is present is dangerous and irresponsible.'

In another incident three 'drunk' girls were seen posing on top of a croc trap next to a warning sign, the NT News reported.

The teenagers posted the picture to Instagram with the caption 'Drunk Jess No parents Croc traps'.

In April this year two men were spotted fishing near a crocodile cage

This comes after the remains of 22-year-old Travis Costa were found inside a saltwater crocodile in Tiwi Islands north of Darwin last week.

In June, a 62-year-old man was snatched by a large crocodile from a boat moored at the Flying Fox Waterhole in Kakadu National Park.

In January a 12-year-old Aboriginal boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends, also at Kakadu. The attack came at a billabong within the Magela creek system near the Mudginberri community.

Crocodile traps are large steel cages with large pieces of bait placed inside them.  When an animal enters the cage and attempts to take the bait the cage door closes and  locks the animal inside.

The traps are strategically placed on the banks of rivers or billabongs where rangers suspect an animal may be present, and the Kakadu rangers regularly check the traps.
