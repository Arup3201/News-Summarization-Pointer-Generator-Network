She spends her working day swinging a sword around and terrifying every man in the vicinity. He designs dresses.

But that hasn't stopped Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie and designer Giles Deacon from becoming an unlikely twosome.

The pair are believed to have met on New Year's Eve and have since enjoyed several dates, according toÂ Grazia Daily, including a foray to the Elle Style Awards, where the couple larked around with Deacon's designer friends, Henry Holland and Jonathan Saunders.

Following stints as a professional gymnast and artists' model, 6ft Christie shot to fame when she took on the role of Brienne of Tarth in HBO's Game of Thrones.

Her character, a fierce female warrior, is tasked with guarding the wily Jaime Lannister, who is played by Danish actor, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.

Along with Game of Thrones, Christie also starred in the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus alongside Heath Ledger and James Franco in 2009.

But it's her current role that has left the biggest impression so far, not least on the fashion world, which has embraced Game of Thrones style flowing gowns and metallic bodices.

Spotted everywhere from Rodarte to Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy, homages to the hit show aren't hard to find.

What's more, the young, mostly British, cast have become fixtures on the fashion circuit, with Christie joined by co-star Kit Harrington for the Elle Fashion Awards.

Harrington, 26, also starred in a Glamour USA fashion shoot, published last month.
