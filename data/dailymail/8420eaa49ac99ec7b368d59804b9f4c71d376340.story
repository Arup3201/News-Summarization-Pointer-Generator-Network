A man filmed himself jumping from a 90ft bridge after downing a bottle of alcoholic ginger beer as part of the dangerous 'NekNominate' drinking craze.

Rex Rickard was described as 'irresponsible and stupid' by police who rushed to the scene fearing that he was attempting to commit suicide.

He posted video of the reckless jump online after the incident, admitting that the stunt was 'not clever'.

The prank was part of the NekNominate trend, which sees participants down alcoholic drinks - often accompanied by other extreme feats - before nominating someone else to do the same.

Danger: Bystanders said they could barely believe he was able to survive the jump into 6ft of water

The craze has been widely condemned by safety campaigners after the deaths of two young men were linked to NekNominate.

Mr Rickard, 32, drank a bottle of Crabbies alcoholic ginger beer before jumping from the Wadebridge bypass in Cornwall on Sunday.

He landed in a stream which was just 6ft deep - but managed to escape with only a minor foot injury.

A passing police patrol witnessed the jump and helped him out of the river, but decided not to take any further action against him.

Mr Rickard, who was wearing a camera during the stunt, posted the video on his Facebook page, adding: 'Not clever! Foot really hurts. Foot's gone pretty fat.'

But friends praised his reckless actions, with one saying: 'What a legend! This should go down in the history books LOL'.

Long way down: The daredevil admitted that the jump, part of the NekNominate craze, was 'not clever'

The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global.

The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world.

The
concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck 
your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. 
The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink 
Responsible'.

The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet.

One
popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down 
the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain 
bowl to lap it up.

Sergeant Andy Stewart, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said he initially thought the jump was a suicide attempt, adding that he gave Mr Rickard 'strong words of advice' after the incident.

Sergeant Robin Moorcroft said the prankster was 'very lucky to be alive'.

He said: 'Have a laugh by all means. A bit of fun doesn't harm anybody but something like this is very irresponsible and very stupid.

'Rex is lucky because the water was only about 6-7 foot deep at the time. This certainly doesn't set an example to others on Facebook, especially teenagers.'

Jennifer Brookes, a local resident who witnessed Mr Rickard's jump, said: 'Me and partner saw the man on the wrong side of the rails from my window.

'Then a police vehicle approached slowly and the bloke jumped off, the police vehicle reversed and the policeman got out, looked over the Wadebridge side and then the other.

'We saw the guy come up the bank and then he proceeded to take wet clothes off. The policeman appeared to be talking to him from the bridge rail above for about 10 minutes.

'I can't believe he survived as it was way off high tide.'

Tragic: Jonny Byrne (right), 19, was found in a river in County Carlow, Northern Ireland, while Ross 
Cummings (right), 22, died after drinking spirits in Dublin. They are both believed to have been playing 'Neknominate'

Other NekNominate videos to make 
headlines include a clip of a woman riding a horse into Tesco, and a man
 drinking a pint of cider mixed with urine with three goldfish in it.

Last weekend the craze apparently took a tragic turn as two young men died in Ireland.

Ross
 Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early 
hours of Saturday morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was
 drinking spirits at the time of his death.

Hours
 later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the 
river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as 
part of a nomination.

Some
 web users have attempted to turn the trend into a positive movement by 
encouraging people to do good deeds, such as giving blood, instead of 
drinking.
