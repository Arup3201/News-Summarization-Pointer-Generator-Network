Overweight or obese? BMI underestimates how fat a person is in nearly half of cases

The obesity epidemic could be far worse than previously realised because of serious flaws in the  way body fat is measured, according to a study.

Researchers said the Body Mass Index – the formula usually used to determine fat – drastically underestimated how many people should regard themselves as unhealthily overweight or obese.

More than a third of adults in the  U.S. are considered obese.

But the New York study concluded that 39 per cent of Americans were being classified as overweight on the basis of their BMI when they were actually obese.

The study’s authors, Dr Eric Braverman, of Weill Cornell Medical School, and Dr Nirav Shah, the New York state health commissioner, calculated the BMI – weight in kg divided by height in metres squared – of nearly 1,400 adult patients at a private health clinic.

They then compared the results with those of a more sophisticated measurement, a blood test combined with a Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan, which measures a person’s body fat, muscle mass and bone density.

The comparison found BMI wrongly classified half of the women, and one in four men.

While only 26 per cent of the patients were classed as obese according to BMI, 65 per cent of them fell into that category when measured with the DXA scan. Dr Braverman said BMI should be called the ‘baloney mass index’ because it was so inaccurate.

The most widely used way to measure an adult's weight is to calculate body mass index (BMI).

This is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared.

If your BMI is between 25 and 29.9, you are over the ideal weight for your height (overweight).

If your BMI is between 30 and 39.9, you are obese.

If your BMI is over 40, you are very obese (known as ‘morbidly obese’).

However, this method can't take into account if you are muscular.

‘The Body Mass Index is an insensitive measure of obesity, prone to under-diagnosis,’ he said.

The study found BMI was especially prone to underestimating obesity in women.

In addition, the likelihood of error increased as they got older.

Fifty-nine per cent more women  aged 70 or over were classified as obese when measured with a DXA scan than their BMI suggested.

Researchers said this was because women lost more muscle to fat than men as they age.

As BMI does not distinguish between muscle and fat, it doesn’t pick up on the change.

‘BMI does not tell you how much fat you have,’ Dr Braverman added.

n DEATHS from womb cancer have increased by 20 per cent over the past decade, driven by rising obesity, experts warn.

The death rate in the UK from womb cancer has risen from 3.1 to 3.7 per 100,000 since the mid-1990s.

This means more than 1,900 women are 
dying from the disease each year, compared with fewer than 1,500 at the 
turn of the millennium, the charity Cancer Research UK said.

Reporting in the open access journal PLoS ONE researchers recognised that BMI was a convenient, low cost and safe way of calculating a person's weight. It is the most widely used way to measure weight in the U.S and UK.

However, the authors said the outdated mathematical equation needed to evolve to correctly evaluate body fat.

'These estimates are fundamental to U.S. policy addressing the epidemic of obesity and are central to designing interventions aimed at curbing its growth,' the authors said, 'yet the [current policies] may be flawed because they are based on the BMI.'

The authors said levels of leptin, a hormone protein, are strongly correlated to body fat.

They suggested that if DXA was deemed to expensive that leptin levels could be used alongside BMI to create a more accurate picture of obesity.

Combining BMI with blood test to measure levels of key protein would be 'more accurate'
