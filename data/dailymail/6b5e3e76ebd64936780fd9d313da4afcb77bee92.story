If you've ever tried in vain to impress a date by taking them to a to restaurant, you may have encountered ever foodie's worst nightmare - the huge waiting line.

However, a range of new apps aim to come to the rescue - if you're willing to pay.

Resy offers New Yorkers the chance to buy in-demand reservations at exclusive eateries - and is just one of several apps offering 'sold out' tickets, tables and even cronuts for sale.

For about $25 per person on a Saturday night or $10 on a Tuesday Resy lets people buy exclusive reservations.

Reservation apps for New Yorkers include:

Killer Rezzy- restaurants in New York and The Hamptons

Resy - New York restaurants

Shout - everything for theatre shows and cronuts to restaurants

Zurvu - restaurants

The brainchild of restauranteur Ben Leventhal and financial investor Gary Vaynerchuk, it is working with restaurants directly to offer sold out seats.

'It depends on the restaurant, but each of the restaurants on Resy are turning over some of their reservations to us so we can offer them to customers, to our customers,' Leventhal  told Eater.

Already available for limited download, Resy shows users up-to-the-minute reservations that are available in their area on a given evening and, like Uber, the price depends on demand.

'Those tables will vary in price, two bar seats on a Tuesday night at Charlie Bird might be ten bucks a piece and Saturday night at Minetta Tavern might be closer to fifty.'

However the app has come under fire for being elitist on Twitter.

Food writer and editor Gabriella Gershenson tweeted, 'Resy belongs in American Psycho's New York City.'

Shout, another 'reservation' app expands the idea to anything in New York - even cronuts

Killer Rezzy, which offers a similar service, says it caters for a premium consumer.

'There are hundreds of thousands of individuals in New York who live in a premium product economy,' Sasha Tcherevkoff, a 40-year-old former restaurateur who founded Killer Rezzy, told Bloomberg.

'They want a product and they don’t mind paying a premium to get that conveniently.'

the firm allows people to buy tables at restaurants across New York and the Hamptons.

'We provide our members with instant, confirmed access to NYC's toughest tables at the best times. Premium tables, premium times, for a premium that doesn’t break the bank,' it claims.

Shout, another 'reservation' app expands the idea to anything in New York.

'These spots can take all forms, physical or virtual,' the firm says.

'Physical spots can include a spot in line for a no-reservation restaurant, the new iPhone, or even a blanket-sized piece of prime real estate in Sheep Meadow.

'Virtual spots are those that can only be reserved in advance; for instance, a restaurant reservation or a ticket to a show.'

The app includes dozens of listings for cronuts, for instance, alongside ticket to see SNL and other 'impossible to buy' listings.
