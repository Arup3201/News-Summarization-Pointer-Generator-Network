A teenager had an incredible escape when he deliberately tried to throw himself over a car for a stunt, got hit and flipped over in mid-air before landing square on his feet.

Daniel Jensen, from Tarzana, California, was tossed metres into the air and flipped over as he tried to prove to friends he could jump high enough to clear the car.

The botched stunt was filmed on June 9 and footage shows the 17-year-old running towards the car as it speeds towards him at around 40mph on a suburban street.

Lucky: Daniel Jensen, from Tarzana, California, being tossed metres into the air

Then, just before the car reaches him, Daniel leaps into the air but the car catches his foot on the top of the windscreen and is sent flying sideways.

Incredibly, he flips over and lands on his feet unhurt.

Daniel told ninemsn he had jumped over a set of blocks higher than the car previously and so figured he could pull off the stunt.

'I wasn't sure when to jump and jumped too late which is why I got hit,' Daniel said.

'I knew I had jumped too late, then I heard my legs hit the car and I knew I was going flying, so I closed my eyes because I didn't want to see myself flying through the air,' he said.

The grainy video footage taken by Daniels's friends shows him metres in the air after impact

Daniel ran away shouting with his hands in the air. Incredibly, he was unhurt

'I opened my eyes and saw the ground and just threw my feet down and when I landed I was in so much shock about what just happened that I threw my hands up and yelled.'

Daniel said that aside from the shock, he amazingly walked away from the incident without any serious injuries and has since been swimming, hiking and practicing more stunts.

'All I have is a bruised ankle and some scratches - but the bruise isn't even serious,' he said.

The car on the other hand was not so lucky, suffering a damaged windshield.
