U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder today told the House Judiciary Committee he 'knew nothing' about his agency's possession of two months' worth of phone records from reporters and editors of the Associated Press. 

Like White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a day earlier, he professed to know little or nothing about the case.

California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren told Holder she was frustrated by his Department of Justice's seizure of the phone records, and insisted that notifying the AP could not have threatened the integrity of the investigation into a leak of classified information to a reporter.

'This is both an ongoing matter, and an ongoing matter about which I know nothing,' Holder replied.

Bosom buddies: President Barack Obama (L) and Eric Holder (C) attended the National Peace Officers Memorial Service on Wednesday just hours before Holder would tell a hostile congressional panel that 'he knew nothing'

Laughing it off: both Obama and Holder have gone to great lengths to distance themselves from the scandals lapping at the White house door

‘It seems to me that the damage to a free press has been substantial,' Lofgren said.

The DoJ is also investigating the Internal Revenue Service for targeting conservative groups for special scrutiny after the applied for tax-exempt status.

The hearing came barely a half-day after President Obama responded to a report from the IRS Inspector General, which largely exonerated the IRS’s upper management. 

But Obama’s statement seemed calculated to lay the blame at the IRS’s feet, insulating the White House from reporters’ future questions about responsibility and accountability.

Obama called the IRS’s conduct ‘intolerable and inexcusable,’ saying in a statement that ‘[t]he IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity. This report shows that some of its employees failed that test.’

‘Regardless of how this conduct was allowed to take place,’ Obama said, ‘the bottom line is, it was wrong.’

The Inspector General’s report found that IRS employees in Cincinnati, Ohio, wrongly targeted conservative groups by asking inappropriate questions and justifying them mas part of an investigation into whether the organizations were trying to hide political advocacy behind a façade of public charity.

Back off: Holder told the Republican-controlled committee: ''I am not familiar with the reasons why [the case was pursued] in the way that it was, because I¿m simply not a part of the case'

Anger: Holder was furious at the hearing that an RNC member had demanded his resignation

The FBI, not the State Department or the Department of Homeland Security, was designated as the lead investigative agency after terrorists attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The State Department's second-in-command in Libya at the time of the attack, Greg Hicks, testified in an earlier hearing that it took 'maybe 18 days to get the FBI team to Benghazi' for an investigation to commence

Wisconsin Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner reminded Holder that federal regulations required his agency to inform the press before it seized phone records.

Asked why that never happened, Holder replied, 'That I don't know. There are exceptions if the integrity of the investigation would be impacted. I don't know why that didn't happen.'

But he defended his staff, despite not knowing the content of their investigation, or where it has led them.

'I have faith in the people who actually were responsible for this case, that they were aware of the rules and that they followed them,' Holder said, 'but I don’t have a factual basis to answer the questions that you have asked, because I was recused.'

In particular, Holder said he was 'not familiar' with how the DOJ subpoena was written, or how it was executed.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney took questions from reporters while Holder faced a grilling at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Like Holder, Carney has professed that the White House knows little about the IRS scandal or the AP phone-record seizures, insisting that the president found out about both matters from published news accounts

Democrats seemed equally bothered by the intrusion of government agencies into journalists' press freedoms. Rep. John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat and the committee's ranking opposition member, said he was 'deeply troubled by the notion that our government would secretly pursue such a broad array of media phone records over such a long period of time.'

Goodlatte opened his questioning by pressing Holder on the DOJ's performance before and after the Boston bombing. The Russian government warned the U.S. about accused bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed days after the bombing in a police shootout. 

Holder suggested in his testimony that it was other nations, not America's law enforcement officials, who should have done more.

'I'm not at all certain,' he offered, 'that all of the requests that were made to a foreign country by the FBI were replied to in an adequate manner.'

On Benghazi, Holder offered a cryptic promise. Federal authorities, he said, have 'taken steps that are definitive and concrete. ... We are prepared to reveal shortly what we have done.'

The attorney general did not elaborate.

The Justice Department secretly obtained telephone records from April and May of 2012 of reporters and editors for the AP, in what the news outlet's top executive called a 'massive and unprecedented intrusion' into how news organizations work

Notably, Holder's prepared testimony didn't address either the IRS investigation or the AP phone records case, likely because neither was yet a political football  by the time his statement was drafted. Congressional testimony given by high-ranking political appointees typically goes through a lengthy vetting process that can take days or even weeks.

But under questioning from Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, Holder predicted that the DOJ's investigation into the IRS could involve 'potential civil rights law[breaking],' as well as 'false statement violations.'

Smith called the IRS's targeting of tea party groups and other conservative applicants for tax-exempt status 'a threat to our democracy.'

Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia also asked about the IRS investigation, suggesting that employees who targeted tea party groups could face felony charges.

Holder said he wasn't so sure, although the conduct involved was 'outrageous.'

'To the extent that there are enforcement gaps that we find, we will let this committee know,' he said.

BENGHAZI

It allegedly took the FBI 18 days to arrive and set up an investigation after terrorists laid waste to the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, leaving four Americans dead. And few answers have been forthcoming about why the Obama administration has been so tight-lipped about the subsequent investigation. Holder likely knows everything, and Republicans on Capitol Hill want that information. 

AP PHONE RECORDS

The DOJ secretly obtained the phone records of Associated Press journalists in at least three cities without informing the news bureau beforehand, in order to learn who leaked information about a classified CIA operation. But federal regulations generally require notification of journalists before the government invades their First Amendment freedoms. Holder claims to know nothing, saying that he recused himself from the investigation since he himself was interviewed in connection with the probe. But that begs the question of how anyone at the top levels of the DOJ could investigate the leak without an apparent conflict of interest, since many if not all of them have security clearances sufficient to see the material that was leaked.

IRS TARGETING TEA PARTY

The Internal Revenue Service has admitted running a longstanding program that targeted right-wing groups - including those aligned with the politically successful tea party - for extra scrutiny, through delay tactics and intrusive mandatory questionnaires. Holder has announced an investigation, but is tight-lipped about whether he suspects laws were broken. One Republican senator has called for the IRS commissioner to be fired, while the speaker of the House has asked aloud whether anyone is ‘going to jail.’ Since that ‘anyone’ is likely to be a political appointee, Republicans are frustrated at Holder’s coy answers and his claim to know little at this early point in the investigation.

BOSTON BOMBING

Holder and other cabinet officials have been criticized for failing to act on warnings from Russia, and perhaps other nations, about the accused Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. And the FBI was lambasted for showing photos of the Tsarnaev brothers publicly instead of asking the Islamic Society of Boston to identify them. Once they saw their photos on television, the brothers ran – shooting a police officer to death in the process.
