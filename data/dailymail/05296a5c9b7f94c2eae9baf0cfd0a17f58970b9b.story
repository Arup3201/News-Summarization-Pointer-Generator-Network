A third student has come forward to accuse a 29-year-old Florida teacher already facing nearly two dozen charges for sex with teens in her school.

Jennifer Fichter now faces 34 separate criminal charges for having sexual relationships with at least three students in separate schools where she taught English.

The third student was between the ages of 16 and 17-years-old when his relationship with Fichter turned physical, sources told WKMG.

More charges: English teacher Jennifer Fichter is facing more than 30 counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor after a third student came forward alleging he had a relationship with her. Pictured above in court last month

Fichter and the student are believed by authorities to have had sexual contact from August 2012 to December 2012, the station reported.

Detectives had been interviewing the Polk County teen at the time the disgraced teacher was arrested for the previous cases.

The second student, now 20, was also 17 in September 2011 when Fichter started inviting him over to her apartment where they would cuddle on the couch and watch TV.

He says the relationship turned sexual the next month and they went on to have intercourse about 20 times for seven months - sometimes in the boy's bedroom while his mother was away, according to the arrest report.

Allegations: The third student says he had a relationship with Fichter in 2012, when he was just 16 years old

Fichter was initially arrested in April 
after the mother of one of Central Florida Aerospace Academy's juniors 
found intimate text messages from the teacher on her son's phone.

Fichter was charged then with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor, and was charged with 20 more counts on Wednesday after the second student's revelations. Neither teen has been identified.

The new charges come just one day after the Polk County School Board voted unanimously to fire Fichter after an investigation into the affair she had with the current student.

According to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse with the current student began in November 2011 when the pair had sex in the early morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup truck.

The teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New Tampa Highway.

He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents.

The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27.

When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'.

Police said the mom confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter.

The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long.

The mother also agreed to speak to the teacher and record the conversation for investigators.

During
 the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the 
teen's child and had an abortion. The woman also said she was in love with
 the student and wanted to continue seeing him.

'The victim's mother discovered this relationship after reviewing text messages from her son and she asked that Fichter respond to her residence to talk,' a Lakeland police statement said, according to Orlando Sentinel.

'According to the victim's mother, Fichter admitted to the sexual encounters and professed her love for him,' authorities said.

Fichter was arrested at her Davenport home soon after the conversation, and booked at the Polk County Jail.

And the two students at the space academy aren't the only boys Fichter is accused of abusing.

Fichter resigned from her job at Robinswood Middle School in Orange County in 2008 after it was reported she had feelings for an eighth-grade student.

Fichter is now in jail after being accused of having sex with at least one minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck

A 40-page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him.

She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’

Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night.

When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’

The report said Fichter and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed.

An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy. No charges were ever filed in relation to that incident.
