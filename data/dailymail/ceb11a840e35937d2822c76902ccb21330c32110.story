A mass for family and close friends of Oscar de la Renta will be held on November 3 in New York

Oscar de la Renta, the renowned
fashion designer who died last Monday at the age of 82, will be
buried at a private funeral in New York early next month.

A mass for family and close friends will be held on November 3 at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola at Park Avenue in
Manhattan, according to Vogue magazine.

The Dominican-born designer, who dressed Hollywood stars,
American first ladies and wealthy socialites, died at his home
in Connecticut surrounded by his family.

During his lengthy career De la Renta was known for his
sophisticated suits with fitted jackets, feminine dresses in
pastel colors and flowered prints, and elaborate evening gowns.

He was a favorite among actresses including Sarah Jessica
Parker, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, who wore his creations
on the red carpet.

One of his most recent creations was the lace,
off-the-shoulder wedding gown he created for human rights lawyer
Amal Alamuddin for her September wedding to actor George Clooney
in Venice, Italy.

Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, who wrote a
tribute to her close friend on the magazine's website following
his death, is expected to be among the designers, fashionistas
and celebrities to attend the funeral.

In the Dominican Republic, where de la Renta had a home and
his philanthropy changed the lives of thousands of children,
flags were flown at half mass during a national day of mourning.

President Danilo Medina credited the designer for raising up
the name of the Dominican Republic over the world.
