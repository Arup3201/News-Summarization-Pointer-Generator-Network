'On something': Ammon Jacob Woodhead allegedly tried to break into four homes with wielding an axe

A man has been arrested after allegedly terrorising a neighbourhood with an axe in an early-morning rampage while high on drugs.

Ammon Jacob Woodhead, 27, allegedly broke into a home near Salt Lake City, Utah while wielding the weapon and attacked two residents inside, before trying to break into three other homes.

He eventually clambered onto a roof of a house on the street - Vinecrest Drive - where an hour-long stand-off with police ensued before he finally surrendered.

'I am traumatized. I am shaking still,' the homeowner toldÂ KSL after the bizarre attack.

Woodhead allegedly drove to the neighbourhood in a car he stole from the city, before breaking into a home at 4.30am by kicking down the front door - while carrying the hatchet.

He went to a bedroom inside the home and attempted to hit a person sleeping the bed with the blunt end of the axe, police told KSL. The person escaped without injury.

When Woodhead tried to leave, a man confronted him inside the house and allegedly tried to attack him - but the man chased after him with a flashlight and a golf club, police said.

He scarpered to another house and tried to break in by hacking at the door and its lock with the hatchet - waking the family inside.

'You couldn't even make that noise with a
fist,' Minya Alisa said. 'It sounded like someone had a big sledgehammer and was trying to 
bang through the door. We were so scared, we were freaking 
out.'

Woodhead was unable to get inside the home and ran to another, where he knocked on the door, police said. The homeowners did not answer and he ran to a fourth house, where he rang the bell.

He ran to the home's workshop and smashed its windows, police said.

'The next thing I knew I heard somebody on my roof,' the resident, who did not want to be identified, said. 'And then I came down and looked out the blinds and there was a whole bunch of cops and people with flashlights up and down the street.

'And I can hear the guy on my roof trying to chop the air conditioner off to get into my home.'

Alisa said she watched the scene from her home next door.

'From
our backyard we saw his shadow on the roof,' she told KSL. 'Police were
just yelling, "Put the axe down, put the axe down!" It was so scary
to see his shadow and swinging the axe on the roof.'

Witnesses recounted how the man said: 'I'm not going back to jail' and asked police to shoot him.

Woodhead eventually dropped the axe before holding a knife to his throat, witnesses said.

Police used a water hose, a bean bag gun, a Taser and even took a police dog on to the roof in attempts to subdue him, yet they did not have any effect.

Stand off: Witnesses took this picture as police tried to get him off the roof. He finally surrendered and is in jail

Woodhead eventually surrendered after he became too cold, police said. He was taking to a local hospital and then booked into the Salt Lake County jail.

He faces charges of of aggravated burglary, aggravated assault, criminal mischief, among others.

Neighbours agreed Woodhead appeared to be under the influence of a drug, and investigators said they think he was 'under the influence of something'.

He has a history of drug and theft related charges, public records show.
