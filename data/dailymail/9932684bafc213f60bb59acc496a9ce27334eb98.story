It's not every day a superhero appears at your window unannounced - so these sick children got quite a shock when a gang of caped visitors began scaling the walls of their hospital.

The young patients, some suffering from cancer, at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, watched in astonishment as the group abseiled down the side of the building.

The stunt, which took place on Thursday, was performed by members  of the City of Aurora Police SWAT team after a cancer survivor made the suggestion.

Heroes: The stunt was arranged with the help of the City of Aurora Police SWAT team after a cancer survivor made the suggestion on the Facebook page for The Bucket List Life

Hallie Wastell posted the idea on the Facebook page for The Bucket List Life, a website dedicated to helping others tick off life experiences.

The site, which is liked by more than 30,000 people, thought the suggestion was so good they took it upon themselves to make the experience a possibility.

Dressed as Captain America, Robin, Batman and Spiderman, the heroic gang took turns to scale down the building, some hanging upside down as they waved into children.

On Facebook, Ms Wastell said: 'I am so grateful to The Bucket List Life, The Children's Hospital Denver, the Aurora SWAT team and so many more for helping me make this happen!'

Describing photos she took on the day, the mother added: 'I so apologize for the over-posting, but these truly show what today was all about...the kids.

'These kids on the oncology floor...some of the bravest among us.'

Hospital spokesman, Elizabeth Whitehead, said: 'Our patients, families and staff were simply delighted to see superheroes through the windows of the hospital.

'I think the police department had just as much fun - if not more - seeing the smiles and excitement on the kids' faces.'
