The wife of former Vice President Dick Cheney took a swipe at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday, mocking her claims last month that she and then-President Bill Clinton descended into poverty as they left the White House.

During a lunch event in Washington, D.C. hosted by Politico, Lynne Cheney recalled her husband's decision to accept the vice presidential nomination.

'When Dick was asked to be vice president, he thought that was a great idea,' she said.

'I was not so sure. You know, give up your job, give up your house and move. We weren’t "dead broke," excuse me.'

Members of @CODEPINK crashed a Monday afternoon lunch event and interrupted the Cheneys with calls for war crimes prosecutions

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was roundly criticized in June for claiming she and Bill Clinton were 'dead broke' when they left the White House in 2001

Hillary Clinton drew ridicule after an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer in which she said her own family was 'dead broke' in 2001 because or multiple home mortgages.

The Clintons have reportedly collected in excess of $100 million for heir public speeches since leaving the White House.

Dick Cheney warned that America can't 'wish away the problem' of jihadis in the Middle East, but protesters from the far-left pressure group Code Pink weren't in the mood to hear him.

A trio of pink-clad activists were among what a Politico event host called 'the first-ever standing room only Playbook lunch,' and they interrupted

'Dick Cheney should be tried for war crimes!' shouted one. 'You destroyed Iraq and you're destroying this country!'

'We call for the arrest of Dick Cheney!' yelled a third.

The three were escorted out but stole the attention of a rapt crowd, one after another, for nearly three minutes .

'It never gets old,' an annoyed moderator carped.

'I wondered why the line was so long,' quipped Lynne.

Politico cut its live video fed for nearly one minute as one of the activists approached the stage and held u pa pair of handcuffs to 'arrest' the former VP.

Referring to the disruptive audience members as 'pink ladies' and a 'pink gentleman,' Cheney daughter Lis had her own take.

'That's not what America is about,' she said. 'It's not supposed to be about shouting people down.'

Lynne, who is hawking a book about American founding father James Madison, said he would have favored a robust disagreement about government policy, but 'I'm not sure he would have put up with it for quite so many minutes.'

She mocked the activists by shouting, political convention-style, 'Four more years! Four more years!'

The group gloated on Twitter as the lunch continued that 'we "ruined" your lunch because dick Cheney destroyed Iraq.'

Former Vice President Cheney said President Obama made a mistake when he withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011

The former vice president weighed in heavily on President Barack Obama's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, deriding him for believing he 'can go in and declare the war is over.'

Of the Bush administration's invasion and sustained military presence in the Middle Eastern country after the fall of dictator Saddam Hussein,

'I look back on it now and it was absolutely the right thing to do,' he said.

Obama, he complained, 'has dramatically reduced the military ... we're delivering pink slips to officers in the United States army.'

'That is absolutely an outrage.'

He insisted that Obama should beef up military spending, 'not food stamps or highways.'

President George W. Bush, Cheney noted, has 'made a decision that he wasn't going to criticize his successor. ... I'm not bound by those strictures. Some people don't like that.'

Answering a question about Obama's implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Cheney agreed with Republican critics and said 'I think he exceeded the limits of his constitutional authority.'
