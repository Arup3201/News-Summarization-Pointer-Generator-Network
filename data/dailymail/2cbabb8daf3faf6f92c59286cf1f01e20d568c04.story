A college football star has been arrested for barking at a police dog.

University of Florida (UF) linebacker Antonio Morrison was arrested Sunday morning for allegedly barking at a police dog while officers were responding to an unrelated dispute. His second arrest in two months has taken him off the field for at least two games.

Morrison has been suspended for at least the first two games of the season by UF coach Will Mushcamp after his second arrest in five weeks.

‘walked up to the open window’ of a squad car and ‘made barking sounds 
in the window where my K9 partner Bear was located,’ the arresting 
officer wrote in the report.

The linebacker ‘spontaneously stated 
several times that he made a 'woof-woof' sound at the dog because the 
dog barked at him’ after being advised by officers that distracting the 
dog prevents it from properly doing its job while they arrested him, 
which he is charged with resisting.

Morrison, 19, was also 
arrested in June for assaulting a bouncer outside a Gainesville, FL bar making his latest arrest his second in only five weeks.

Citing those two arrests, Muschamp suspended Morrison for the opening game August 31 against Toledo and the following game on the road against the University of Miami, according to the Associated Press.

Morrison recently received deferred prosecution on the misdemeanor simple battery charge after being accused June 16 of punching a bouncer outside a Gainesville bar, records show.

His record was to be clean if he stayed out of trouble, attended a drug and alcohol abuse program at UF, attended anger management classes and completed two ride-alongs with campus police, according to the Gainesville Sun.

Morrison is the second UF football player arrested in the past few weeks. Walk-on punter Grant Van Aman, 19, was arrested June 29 in Gainesville for DUI after riding his scooter through a stop sign directly in front of a Gainesville Police officer, according to WRCB.
