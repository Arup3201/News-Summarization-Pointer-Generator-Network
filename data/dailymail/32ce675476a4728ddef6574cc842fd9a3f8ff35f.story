Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has quashed talk of him facing a spell on the sidelines after limping out of Belgium's win against Andorra on Friday, by taking a spinning class for some of his international team-mates.

The 28-year-old was forced off early on in the second half with a knee problem, with Manchester City fans bound to have been concerned after seeing their star defender get strapping applied to his leg on the bench immediately afterwards.

However, after speaking to Belgian TV RTBF station he dismissed these fears saying: 'All is well. Before the game I informed the coach of a few glitches. He decided to spare me and bring me off.'

And the Belgian defender has wasted no time in getting back on his feet as he showed off his physical training instructor skills as he took charge of the spinning class session, with the likes of Premier League and Tottenham duo Jan Vertonghen and Nacer Chadli in attendance. 

Kompany posted a picture of him in action during the session on his official Twitter account saying: 'Spinning instructor. #KeepUpThePace'.

Kompany is set to face a familiar face in the shape of City team-mate Edin Dzeko on Monday evening, as Belgium look to make it back-to-back wins in their European Championship 2016 qualifying group when they travel to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
