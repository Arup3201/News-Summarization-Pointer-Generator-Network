No tax cut: Danny Alexander told the Daily Mail that the top rate of tax will stay at 45p until at least 2015

The top rate of income tax will not be cut, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has warned Tory MPs.

Danny Alexander, the most senior Liberal Democrat in the government after Nick Clegg, said there was ‘no prospect’ of the 45p rate being cut in this Parliament.

He gave a strong indication that the Lib Dems would never agree to reduce the rate, even in the event of another coalition government with the Conservatives.

‘45p is a good place to be - it is mid-range on international league tables,’ Mr Alexander told the Daily Mail.

‘My priority is to cut taxes for working people in this country. The best way of doing that is to increase the basic threshold.’

Boris Johnson recently said there was ‘no doubt’ that Chancellor George Osborne would cut the top rate of tax ‘in this parliament’.

David Cameron also suggested he would consider slashing the rate down to 40p if it meant rich people ended up paying more tax.

The Prime Minister pointed out that reducing the rate from 50p had actually raised more revenue, as fewer people were trying to dodge tax.

The coalition reduced the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p in 2012. Mr Cameron said: ‘It just seemed to me that if your top rate of tax is not raising the money that it should, and it’s holding back the competitiveness of the economy, then even if it’s politically unpopular to change it, you must do it.

'I’m trying to sweep away all the things that hold back the chance of Britain being a real success story in the 21st century.

‘What we’ve seen since the change is actually the growth of tax revenues. Tax rates should be set to raise money, not to send messages. I’m interested in making sure that the rich in this country pay a lot of tax, which they do.

'They’re paying a bigger share ... than they were. If people can bring forward arguments about how to maximise the revenue from the top rate of tax, I’m always interested to read them.’

But Mr Alexander made clear the Lib Dems would block any further cut in the 45p rate, which applies to income of £150,000 or over.

Asked if it would go back to 40p, the rate for almost all of Labour’s years in power, he replied: ‘There is no prospect of that. I tell you from me, I am a tax cutter by instinct but I want to cut taxes for ordinary people in this country. I am quite willing to ask the wealthiest for a bit more.’

Tory consensus: David Cameron, left, and George Osborne, right, are both thought to be in favour of a rate cut

Mr Alexander suggested he favoured wealth taxes on the richest, but targeted at assets rather than earnings.

In a wide-ranging interview, he also said that Lib Dems who talked of walking away from the coalition before the general election ‘need their heads examined’.

Lib Dem grandee Sir Menzies Campbell and Business Secretary Vince Cable have both publicly touted a disengagement strategy ahead of polling day in May 2015.

But Mr Alexander called that strategy ‘mad’: ‘Anyone who thinks that we are going to disengage from the Coalition before the election needs their head examined.

‘Every day that the coalition stays strong is a day that the economy gets stronger and we absolutely see that right the way through to polling day.’

Mr Alexander’s insistence that the coalition should stay together is in contrast to Mr Cable, who at the Lib Dem conference said it ‘was certainly possible’ that the parties would split before May 2015.

‘The idea that somehow it would be to our advantage to walk away from that a few months before the election is just mad,’ he said.

‘We hadn’t been in government for 70 years. Now we are a party of government. And as a party of government you don’t walk away from government,’ the Inverness MP said.

He urged activists to ‘shout from the rooftops’ about the role the Lib Dems played as part of the government. ‘We are an independent party, we have got lots of ideas of our own. But we have delivered a lot, we have a record to be proud of. People should shout that from the rooftops.’

The ambitious father of two - who was also the trusted confidante of former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy - declined to rule out standing as party leader in future.

‘I suppose I am hugely privileged to have the chance to do the job I am doing now and hopefully to make a good contribution to the country. Who knows what comes after that.'

‘It’s not something I am spending a lot of time thinking about.'
