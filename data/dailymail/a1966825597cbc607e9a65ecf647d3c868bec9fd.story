The stepmother of a 13-year-old boy who died after he was beaten and kept in a dog cage has been sentenced to 35 years in jail.

Kimberly Kubina, 47, pleaded guilty to felony neglect over teenager Christian Choate’s death, whose severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana shortly after he was reported missing in May 2011.

Kubina’s former husband Riley Choate, 40, of Hammond, Indiana was also sentenced to 80 years in prison last month.

Investigators said the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009.

His disappearance went unreported until Lake County police unearthed his body in May, 2011 from a shallow grave. The Lake County Coroner's Office determined he died of blunt force trauma injuries and a skull fracture.

Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson.

She said that Choate was intimidating and violent and that she feared that the other children, including several nephews and nieces, she was looking after would be taken away by the welfare authorities.

She said in court, according to the Chicago Sun-Times: ‘In our house, whatever Riley said was law.’

The woman told the judge that she 
suffered nightmares about what had happened and that the other children,
who had seen the abuse, were emotionally scarred.

Christian was kept in a dog cage and 
Kubina told the court in May that she told his sister to only feed him 
Asian noodles while locked up as punishment for 'molesting' his younger 
step-brother. 

The 
unidentified sister was not the only one to know about the horrible 
suffering that the boy endured, and up to 13 people are thought to have 
known about the torture without alerting the police.  

Court
records state that the father, Riley Choate, has admitted burying 
Christian's body under a storage shed with a Bible across his chest but 
denied causing the boy's death.

Kubina, the stepmother, repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing, court and Indiana Department of Child Services records show.

Originally, she told police she thought Christian had gone to live with his biological mother.

Only
one person claims to have taken her concerns to the authorities, 
according to the state's Department of Child Services records.

Investigators
say the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long
as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009.

Both Choate and Kubina had pleaded not guilty to all charges surrounding Christian’s death originally.

Choate made a deal with prosecutors 
to plead guilty to some charges in return for a lessened sentence and to
avoid a jury trial. He pleaded guilty to felony charges including 
moving a body after death and neglect of a dependent causing death.

In return for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped charges of murder, battery, criminal confinement and obstruction of justice.

Choate
himself addressed the judge before learning his fate in January, 
saying: 'All my actions will haunt me forever. I loved my son.'

Kubina was given a similar deal for testifying against her former husband.

Kubina's sister, Belinda Bradburn, told The Times she witnessed abuse once while visiting her sister and the children when they lived in Merrillville. She said she saw Riley Choate hit Christian in the arm.

'When that happened, I just said, "Kim, I'm leaving. This is kind of ridiculous that he would just hit a kid, and you need to do something about this",' Bradburn recalled.

In December MailOnline reported that Christian wrote letters from his squalid prison about how he wanted his life to end.

He wrote: ‘I want to die’ on the paper given to him by his stepmother to scribble down how he felt.

In the handwritten notes, he said he simply wanted to be liked by his family  - even if they were ‘abusing’ him.

Christian writes how he had to steal food when he was hungry because his family allegedly would not feed him. He would only be let out to clean the house and was almost never allowed outside. 

‘Christian wrote of why nobody liked him and how he just wanted to be liked by his family,’ DCS records state.

‘Christian stated that he wanted to die because nobody liked the way he 'acted.'

The records continue: 'Christian's writings detail a very sad, depressed child who often wondered when someone, anyone, was going to come check on him and give him food or liquid. Christian often stated he was hungry or thirsty.’
