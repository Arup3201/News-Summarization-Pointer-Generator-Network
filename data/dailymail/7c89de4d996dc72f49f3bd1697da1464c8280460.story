Ed Miliband is trying to hire an expert in broadcasting to stop him looking ‘weird’ on TV.

The Labour party is recruiting a senior adviser to bring ‘fresh ideas’ to overhauling the leader’s image.

In addition to having ideas about how to improve Mr Miliband’s ‘brand strengths’, the successful candidate will also need to have experience of dealing with ‘bad news stories’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is hiring a new TV adviser to improve his image and deal with bad news stories

The new aide will be tasked with changing Mr Miliband's image in the run-up to the 2015 general election

While Labour has maintained a lead in the polls, Mr Miliband’s personal ratings have remained poor.

A YouGov survey last week showed 41 per cent of people think the Labour leader is ‘weird’ or ‘very weird’.

The survey for BuzzFeed, which looked at the public’s perception of the leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school.

With some opinion polls putting Labour’s lead over the Tories at just one point, Mr Miliband has ordered his team to beef up his media operation.

The Labour website is advertising the new role of Head of the Leader’s Broadcasting, to be based in the Leader of the Opposition’s Office.

The new job comes with a £44,244.40 salary, and a ‘fixed sum allowance’ of £971. The contract will last only until a month after the general election, due in May 2015.  

Some 41 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband is 'weird', compared to only 27 per cent who thought the same of David Cameron

The new recruit will be tasked with boosting coverage of the Labour leader and making the most of his ‘brand strengths’.

The job involves ‘overseeing the broadcast output and visual images of the Leader of the Opposition’ and advising Mr Miliband on ‘broadcast performance and helping him prepare for clips/interviews/visits’.

It follows concern that his clips to the cameras have been repetitive. In one interview in 2011 he repeatedly told unions and ministers embroiled in strike threats to ‘set aside the rhetoric’ and ‘get around the negotiating table to stop this happening again’.

The new adviser will also be tasked with improving relations with the main broadcasters in the run up to the election.

It includes: ‘Developing fresh ideas for making the best of Leader of Opposition's brand strengths and communicating his message in broadcast medium.’

According to the advert essential experience for the winning candidate includes ‘experience of working with senior politicians’ and ‘experience of dealing with good and bad news stories’.

While Mr Miliband's current media team is dominated by former newspaper journalists, Mr Cameron's communications chief, Craig Oliver, is a former BBC executive.
