It was certainly a day for wrapping up in something warm at the Cheltenham races.

But few went as far Shirley Overbury – who spent £2,400 on a mink fur coat when she found she had underdressed.

The property developer was one of hundreds of women proudly sporting real fur amid the freezing weather on the first day of the Cheltenham Festival yesterday.

Stalls at the course reported record sales of coats and hats made of fox, beaver and rabbit – with punters and shopkeepers declaring that animal pelts had ‘lost their stigma’.

Certainly Mrs Overbury, who said she bought the coat to look ‘glamorous’, was unapologetic. She said critics of real fur ‘do not know what they are missing’.

Animal charities, however, were ‘appalled’ that race organisers were hosting at least 12 retailers selling both new and vintage fur clothing.

David Bowles, the RSPCA’s head of campaigns, said: ‘Whilst it is legal to sell fur, the RSPCA believes this is a trade that should not be taking place in the UK.

'Animals farmed for their fur are often confined to tiny, barren cages and denied opportunities to perform much natural behaviour.’

Racegoers, though, insisted real fur was more eco-friendly than fake fur and ensured the pelt of animals killed for food did not go to waste.

Mrs Overbury, from Cheltenham, bought her tan and brown-striped mink knee-length coat from a stall inside the course grounds called Devon Clothing.

She said: ‘Ladies like to look glamorous at Cheltenham but it is often cold here, so the furs keep out the wind.’

Events co-ordinator Sarah-Jayne Townend, 27, also had no reservations about wearing fur. She wore a £495 racoon-fur hat that she was bought as a birthday present.

She said: ‘Real fur is the way forward. It keeps you warm and it looks amazing.’

Alison Mossop, 43, who owns her own 
helicopter business, browsed the fur shops while wearing a brown hat 
made of beaver pelt and a mink and sable coat.

She said real fur was more ‘eco-friendly’, adding: ‘It takes ten barrels of oil to make a fake fur coat.’

Roxanna Dent, 33, runs Dent Fine Art stall at Cheltenham Races. As well as selling art, they also sell furs.

Mrs Dent, originally from Siberia, said she had seen a huge change in British attitudes towards fur in the last couple of years.

She said: ‘When I first came to this country eight years ago, people were scared to wear fur.

'Now, people in Britain are friendly towards fur, and we have sold more in the last two years than we did in the six years before that.’

The opening day of the festival was delayed by 35 minutes after a severe overnight frost affected the track.

Temperatures plummeted to -4C in the night, but rose to 3C by the time race-goers arrived at midday.

Yesterday was the best day for punters – and worst day for bookmakers’ – in Cheltenham’s history.

David Williams from Ladbrokes estimated British bookies lost a staggering £15million, after the race favourites enjoyed a series of wins.
