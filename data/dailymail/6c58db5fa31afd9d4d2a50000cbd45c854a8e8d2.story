Search: Three coastguard boats and a police helicopter have been deployed to look for the girl

Police and coastguards are today continuing the search for a 14-year-old girl who was last seen 'in difficulty' in the sea.

Officers were called at 3.46pm yesterday to a report of concern for the girl, who was at Whitmore Bay, Barry Island, in South Wales.

The girl is described as white, 5ft 7in tall, of average build with long black hair and last seen wearing a multi-coloured dress.

Today the coastguard was due to carry out a lunchtime shoreline search of the bay while the tide is out.

Emergency services were still trying to find out if the girl ever left the water.

Inspector Bob Nicholls of South Wales Police said the teenager was in the bay with friends when she got into difficulty.

'She
was in the water with friends,' he said. 'We believe she has got into 
some difficulty and we are looking for her at the moment.

'The coastguard has got three boats launched, South Wales Police helicopter and the search and rescue helicopter have been deployed.

'Numerous resources on foot have been deployed for the search.

'She was on holiday in the area. Her parents are aware and with officers at the moment.'

A force spokesman said: 'South Wales 
Police together with HM coastguard are currently searching the location 
and a missing person enquiry is ongoing.'

Anyone with information is asked to call South Wales Police on 101.

Coastguards believe the girl could have been in difficulty in the water for up to an hour before the situation was reported to them.

Steve Jones, rescue centre manager for HM Coastguard Swansea said: 'The incident was reported to us at 15.54 but we believe she could have been in trouble in the water up to an hour before then.

'We had a report that a fisherman saw her. We are dumbfounded that something 
wasn't said to us earlier and are investigating but our main priority is
the search, which is massive.

Holiday: The girl was one of hundreds of people who flocked to the beach in Barry Island, south Wales, today

'We have the HM Coastguard helicopter
up from Portland, we have the South Wales Police helicopter and three 
RNLI lifeboats on the scene.

'A coastguard rescue team from Barry is continuing to search landside.

'We don't believe that she was that far out in the water. We are going on the assumption that she has not come out of the water.

'Normally, if she had come out then we would have found her by now.

'The police are checking the address where she was staying. They are speaking to her friends who were in the water with her.

'We are really concerned and ask that if anyone has any information that they contact us.

'If she is still in the water, as the time passes by, our concerns grow even deeper.'

Delay: The coastguard said the girl may have been in difficulties for up to an hour before they were called

Mr Jones said the team would continue
searching for as long as possible, though the helicopters would have to
refuel at some stage.

'The girl has to be somewhere,' he said. 'We just hope she is on land but are concentrating our efforts seawards.'

A spokeswoman for the Maritime & 
Coastguard Agency confirmed that the girl had been seen in difficulty an
hour before the alarm was raised.

She said: 'At 3.54pm Swansea Coastguard was contacted by South Wales 
Police reporting that a 14-year-old girl was missing and was last seen 
struggling in the water an hour earlier at Whitmore Bay near Barry.

'Swansea Coastguard requested an air and sea search involving the 
Coastguard rescue helicopter from Portland, Barry Coastguard Rescue 
Team, Barry Dock and Penarth RNLI lifeboats, RNLI beach lifeguards and 
officers from South Wales Police.

'After an extensive search extending outwards from the last reported sighting, the girl has not been found.'

Holiday: The 14-year-old girl was at Whitmore Beach in Barry Island, south Wales

Steve Jones, rescue coordination centre manager at Swansea Coastguard, 
added: 'If you see someone in difficulty in the water you should call 
999 and ask for the Coastguard immediately as any delay means vital 
search and rescue time is lost.

'Occasionally the Coastguard receives false alarms when somebody who 
appears to be in difficulty does not need help but we would rather you 
call 999 anyway if you are genuinely concerned about a situation.'

Plaid Cymru councillor Steffan Wiliam said: 'Our stretch of coast has the world's second highest tidal range, second only to the Bay of Fundy.

'The main issue is that Whitmore Bay is a pocket shape. You have to be careful but it is generally very safe, particularly now we have lifeguards.

'If you swim between the two strips of flags you should be fine. You always have to be sensible on the beaches here.

'I am very concerned to hear that this girl has gone missing. I am the parent of three kids myself and it is awful to hear news like this.'
