It is arguably the most famous road in America, but can Scotland compete with the iconic Route 66 that stretches from Chicago to Los Angeles? 

In a bid to show visitors what the far north of Scotland has to offer, the North Highland Initiative, backed by Prince Charles, has launched the spectacular North Coast 500 route (NC500), which they hope will become as iconic as the American highway.

The stunning touring route will start in the Highland's capital, Inverness, and snake past some of Scotland's impressive coastal and mountain scenery.

The coastal route is said to be ideal for drivers, motorcyclists and even walkers who want to discover the far north of Scotland

The North Coast 500 route in Scotland covers over 500 miles of spectacular Scottish scenery, including sights such as the mountains of Suilven and Canisp from Loch Druim Suardalain

Enjoy Brora Beach along the way. You can sometimes see dolphins, minke whales, and grey and common seals off the coastline, which makes it an ideal place for walking and picnics

The coastal NC500 route has been created to showcase what the far north of Scotland has to offer, including local food, drink, accommodation and activities 

It is hoped the 500-mile route will also help to showcase local food, drink, accommodation, culture, heritage and outdoor and adventure activities.

Unmissable sights along the road include mountain ranges, Ben Hope and Suilven, the fairytale grand castle, Dunrobin, the Ardvreck castle ruins and the breathtaking Achmelvich and Dornoch beaches. 

The route can be completed in a long weekend, or over several weeks on a more leisurely schedule and can be explored as a loop or in part.

Dunrobin Castle has 189 rooms, making it the largest in the northern Highlands. Its origins lie in the Middle Ages, but most of the present building and the gardens was added by Sir Charles Barry between 1835 and 1850. It is located on the NC500 1 mile north of Golspie

Ardvreck Castle is a ruined castle dating from the 16th century which stands on a rocky promontory jutting out into Loch Assynt in Sutherland, north west Highland, Scotland

NHI chairman David Whiteford said: 'NC500 is one of the most exciting and innovative developments for tourism in the north Highlands for some time. Across the globe, touring routes have become famous and often the very reason for visitors making the journey to that country.

'We have, in the North Highlands, an opportunity to create a globally significant route that captures the essence of the wonderful landscapes and seascapes, people, stories, culture, history, adventures, food and drink and much more.'

Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland said: 'There really is nothing quite like the open road, and this particular route really does take in some of the most picturesque parts of our beautiful country. People travel from all over the world for Route 66, and with our scenery, there's no reason why the North Coast 500 can't prove to be just as popular.

'You never know, at the end of the 500 miles, visitors might just be tempted explore 500 more.'

The NC500 route follows the A835 out of Iverness towards the west coast. It then follows the rugged coast line upwards through the north west highlands across the north edge of mainland Britain and then follows the east coast on the A9 from Britain's most northerly village, John O'Groats, looping back to the starting point, Iverness. 

Route 66, in the USA, is colloquially known as the Main Street of America or the Mother Road and construction started on November 11, 1926

1. Route 66 is 2,448 miles long.

2. It was commissioned in 1926.

3. Route 66 starts in Chicago, and ends in L.A. (Santa Monica), covering Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.

4. Route 66 crosses three time zones.

5. In 1926 only 800 miles of Route 66 were paved. The completion of the paving end-to-end came about in 1937.

6. Despite a lot of the Route 66 being replaced by the interstate highways I-55, I-44, I-40, I-15 and I-10,  a surprisingly high amount of old road is still waiting to be found by the more adventurous traveler.

7. Route 66 was the title of a TV series running from 1960 till 1964.

8. In 1985 Route 66 was officially decommissioned, but for daily use it was replaced far earlier by the Interstates.

9. The popularity of Route 66 improved the economy of the small towns along its route during the Great Depression.
