It had been a day she dreamed of ever since she was a little girl, yet just hours after her wedding day was over Florida woman Amanda Karth's memories of her first dance, cutting the cake, and exchanging her vows were lost forever.

'I don't remember the wedding day at all,' she said.

So now ten months later family and friends have gathered to recreate the ceremony and reception so Amanda will have memories to carry forever.

Love: Amanda and Cody Karth had a dream wedding, but after a heart attack she couldn't remember any of it

First dance: Amanda can't even recognize footage of her first dance here with new husband Cody

Again for the first time: Amanda can always remember this second chance for her first dance

The first time twenty-seven-year-old Amanda and husband Cody Karth tied the knot, everything went perfectly. 

'It was fabulous,' Cody told Inside Edition. 'It was everything you could ever want in a wedding and it was the best day of my life.'

The day was a dream, but on their first night as man and wife tragedy struck.

Big day: Karth's second dream wedding was attended by family, friends, and the paramedics who saved her life

The first time twenty-seven-year-old Amanda and husband Cody Karth tied the knot, everything went perfectly. 

'It was fabulous,' Cody told Inside Edition. 'It was everything you could ever want in a wedding and it was the best day of my life.'

The day was a dream, but on their first night as man and wife tragedy struck.

Emergency: After Karth's first wedding day husband Cody woke up to find her passed out and immediately performed CPR

Fluke: Doctors said Amanda suffered from 'Broken Heart Syndrome' a rare condition that causes the heart to cease functioning

Just before sunrise, Cody says he woke up to see his new wife struggling to breath.

'I just grabbed her, 'What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?'' he remembered.

Amanda passed out on the bed, and Cody wasted no time calling 911. As he waited for help, he moved her body to the floor and administered CPR praying to keep her alive.

But when the paramedics arrived, they couldn't find a pulse. Amanda was shocked back to life and sped to the hospital.

Take two: After hearing about Karth's story, Inside Edition paid to have a brand new wedding day for the young bride

Miracle: Doctors were stunned when Amanda recovered from her coma four days after suffering her heart attack

Doctors later discovered Amanda had suffered from a rare phenomena known as 'Broken Heat Syndrome,' in which the heart becomes dysfunctional.

She remained unconscious for four days.

'I just didn't know what to say,' said Dr. Adam Frank of NCH Heart Institute in Naples, Florida. 'I don't know what to offer these people and what kind of outcome they're going to see. And literally the next day I walked in to start rounds Amanda was sitting up.'

Always: This time Amanda can treasure her memories of the day forever

Amanda had achieved a miraculous recovery but couldn't remember a single moment of her wedding day.

After hearing Amanda's story, Inside Edition invited Amana and Cody's friends, family, and even the paramedics who shocked her back to life to the West Bay Club for a redo of the young bride's special day.

Cody may have had a sense of deja vu when his wife smeared wedding cake across his face, but for Amanda it was brand new, and this time a memory she could keep forever.
