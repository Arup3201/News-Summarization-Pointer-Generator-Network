Queen Letizia made a glamorous appearance at an awards ceremony in Madrid earlier today and proved she can create a fashion triumph from the simplest of ensembles.

Wearing a plain black skirt and ladylike white blouse, the Spanish Queen still looked every inch the style icon.

The over-sized waistband and structured silhouette gave an otherwise plain black skirt a high-fashion twist, which she completed with a dash of red lipstick and a pair of dangly black earrings.

The queen was attending the Telefonica Ability Awards, which recognise companies' efforts to integrate disabled people into the work force.

She was joined at the event by Health Minister Alfonso Alonso, who also presented one of the awards.

Letizia, who had a successful career as a journalist before becoming queen, took to the stage to praise the winning companies.

The Spanish royal is back at work after a Christmas break with her husband King Felipe and their two children Leonor, Princess of Asturias and Infanta Sofía of Spain.

The festive break marked an end to a busy end of year for the royal family. 

In November and December, King Felipe and Queen Letizia travelled to Luxembourg, Belgium, Austria and Germany on official engagements.  

During their tour of Berlin, the couple were taken to visit the Brandenburg gate, one of the best-known landmarks in the German capital.
