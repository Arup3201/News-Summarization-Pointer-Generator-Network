He is paid three times the average UK salary, has his own chauffeur and pockets tens of thousands in expenses every year.

But according to Nigel Farage, he is the 'poorest man in politics'.

Despite earning £79,000 a year as an MEP, the Ukip leader, complains of meagre finances on a spin-off show with Steph and Dom Parker, the 'posh couple' from Gogglebox.

Nigel Farage appeared on Channel 4's Gogglebox programme where he is seen quaffing champagne, beer and wine with Dom and Steph Parker

Mr Farage, who admitted he hadn't seen the show before his appearance, enjoyed an evening at the Parkers' guest house in Sandwich, Kent, in which they are normally filmed watching the week's television highlights for Gogglebox

The Ukip leader complained of his meagre finances while on the show and told the Channel 4 programme's 'posh couple': ‘I don’t think I know anybody in politics as poor as we are' 

Mr Farage, pictured in the Channel 4 show, quaffs champagne, beer and wine with the couple, smokes cigarettes and tells them: 'I don't think I know anybody in politics as poor as we are.'

Mr Farage and wife Kirsten Mehr live on the Kent border, in a house worth around £540,000. 

Rather modestly, he told the Parkers it was only a 'small semi-detached house in the country'.

He added: 'We don't drive flash cars, we don't have expensive holidays, we haven't done for ten years.'

The group down several pints of ale in a nearby pub before retiring to the couple's garden in Kent for champagne

Mr Farage admitted he drank two pints and about five or six glasses of wine and champagne while he was with the couple 

According to The Times, Ukip pays him a £60,000-a-year chauffeur allowance.

Among other expenses, he earns a 'daily subsistence allowance' of £250 every time he attends the European Parliament, has an monthly EU allowance of £3,580 to cover UK travel, office management and running costs, and has his first-class travel to the continent covered. 

The UKIP leader has even admitted paying his wife around £20,000 a year from taxpayers' funds to work as his assistant.

Channel 4 boss Jay Hunt said Mr Farage's TV appearance is a 'rip-roaring, alcohol-fuelled watch', adding: 'He gets p***** with them, but they also give him a grilling'. 

At one point in the show, Mr Farage is seen tripping on a step and smashing his glass, and is forced to change into a pair of Mr Parker's ripped jeans

In an interview with Radio Times, Mr Farage blamed the incident on 'physical incapacity' caused by his 2010 plane crash but admitted he was given plenty to drink

Mr Farage said he had not seen Gogglebox before taking part in the Channel 4 show but insisted it would enhance his image with the electorate

In an interview with Radio Times, Mr Farage blamed the incident on 'physical incapacity' caused by his 2010 plane crash. But he admitted he was given plenty to drink.

He said: 'I had two, two-and-a-half pints in the pub with Dom. [It was a] steady consumption… [so] two pints, about five or six glasses [of wine and champagne]. I like a drink but, crikey, these guys are professionals.'

Mr Farage said he had not seen Gogglebox before taking part in the Channel 4 show but insisted it would enhance his image with the electorate.

He added: 'Was I taking a risk going in there? Yes, I was. Politics today is so thoroughly over-scripted. All the rough edges and all the risk is knocked off, and that is why it has become desperately dull. I thought they were genuine and people who like me will like it.'

Earlier this year, Mr Farage was accused of claiming £15,500 a year from the EU to pay for his constituency office despite the fact it was given to him rent free.

He later said the allegation was a 'smear' as the EU money is his to spend 'as I see fit', but he was fined £200 by the Electoral Commission for failing to declare the office as a gift. Steph and Dom Meet Nigel Farage airs on Channel 4 on Monday, December 15 at 10pm.
