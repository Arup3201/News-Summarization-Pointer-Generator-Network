Louis van Gaal has dismissed criticism of his tactics and claimed that Manchester United’s traditional 4-4-2 formation leaves him nervously ‘twitching my ass’ on the bench.

After discussing the merits of a back-three over a back-four on Thursday, the United boss resorted to talking about his backside.

In a variation on Sir Alex Ferguson’s famous quote about ‘squeaky bum time’, Van Gaal said: ‘I know that with 4-4-2 the stats are giving the positive results, but when you analyse the game I have twitched my ass on the bench because we were out of balance.

‘All the matches when we play 4-4-2, like against West Ham United, it was always twitching your ass and I don’t like it.’

The Dutchman’s comments came after frustrated United fans were heard chanting for their team to switch to a more attacking 4-4-2 formation at QPR last weekend – a move that was rewarded with goals from Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson.

Former United captain Gary Neville has also urged Van Gaal to ditch his preferred 3-5-2 system, claiming that the use of three centre-backs slows down play and encourages a safety-first approach. Statistically, United have conceded fewer goals per game using that system this season, but also picked up fewer points.

Van Gaal admitted that his players are still uncomfortable with the new tactics, and there is a growing feeling that United should return to the cavalier style that made Ferguson’s teams so entertaining.

But Van Gaal dismissed the criticism as ‘ridiculous’ and claimed that it was brought on unfairly by the recent home defeat against Southampton.

Reminded of the chants from supporters at Loftus Road, he maintained that he must be left to make decisions irrespective of the feeling among the club’s fanbase.

‘I have to take into account 600million opinions?’ said Van Gaal.

‘I have to communicate with my players and observe my players and analyse my players and my team and my opponent and the quality of my opponent, and then I have to make a decision with my staff.

‘The players are still not comfortable (with 3-5-2). It is very important that they are comfortable, and I would like them to feel more comfortable.

‘But after I switched the system we have won nine or 10 in a row. Then we lose one match and the discussion about the system is coming, so it is ridiculous.’
