Tragedy: 'Teddie' Rainger was discovered at the bottom of the pool at his grandparent's home

A two-year-old boy drowned in a family swimming pool as his parents prepared for their wedding day, an inquest has tragically revealed.

‘Teddie’ Rainger was discovered lying lifeless at the bottom of the pool in Langdon Hills, Essex by his distraught mother in July last year.

Emergency services were called and the little boy was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.

Today an inquest heard how the youngster died as a result of a tragic accident while his parents prepared for their wedding day.

The court heard how Teddie had been left to play with his brother on outside decking for no longer than 10 minutes when the accident occurred.

During the hearing at Chemlsford Coroner's Court Caroline Beasley-Murray told Teddie’s distraught mother and father: 'There was about 10 minutes when you weren’t with them.

'You were busy getting ready for your wedding, is that right?'

Essex Police investigated the tragic death but reported no suspicious circumstances and no criminal charges were brought.

Det Insp Lee Morton, who led the investigation in to the tragic death, told the inquest: “We carried out a full investigation into the death and it was decided no criminal charges would be brought.”

A post-mortem revealed the much-loved toddler died as a result of drowning.

Mrs Beasley-Murray recorded a verdict of accidental death.

She added: 'In light of all the evidence I shall record a verdict that Teddie Rainger died as a result of an accident.

'This was the most tragic of accidents.

'He was a little boy with a bright future and I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family.'
