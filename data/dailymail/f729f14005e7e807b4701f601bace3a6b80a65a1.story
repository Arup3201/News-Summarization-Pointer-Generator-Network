Comedian Tracy Morgan made a rare appearance in public on Saturday as he made his way with the help of a cane to a New York City hospital.

Nearly eight months after his devastating car crash on the New Jersey Turnpike, the 46-year-old still appeared labored as he walked with fiancée Megan Wollover and their daughter Maven.

While the crash--which killed Morgan's comedian friend James McNair--has clearly left the 30 Rock star with lingering injuries, the cane he used Saturday was a step in the right direction.

In December, a decidedly more pained-looking Morgan was pictured using  a walker.

Road to recovery: Actor and comedian Tracy Morgan appeared in New York on Saturday walking with the help of a cane as he battles to recover from a devastating June highway crash that killed his friend Jame McNair

Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in the June 7 accident, according to his lawyer, in which a Wal-Mart truck slammed into a limo van carrying Morgan and others home from a show in Delaware.

 Criminal charges against truck driver Kevin Roper are pending in state court in New Jersey.

McNair, 62, of Peekskill, grew up with Morgan in Brooklyn and was a friend and mentor to him over the years.

The family of McNair settled out of court a wrongful death suit filed against Wal-Mart.

The terms of the settlement are confidential, but McNair family attorney Daryl Zaslow told The Associated Press the family was pleased with the outcome.

May never be the same: The 30 Rock star's attorney Benedict Morelli, said in December that Morgan hadn't fully recovered from his brain injury and that it was uncertain if he would be 'the Tracy Morgan he once was'

Wal-Mart 'caused extensive damage' to the family but accepted responsibility and 'more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family,' Zaslow said.

'Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs,' he said.

Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident.

'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 'We're committed to doing what's right.'
