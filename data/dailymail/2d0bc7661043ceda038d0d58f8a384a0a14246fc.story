The White House claimed today that the United States should be feared by ‘extremists’ in Yemen – even though the last remaining special forces have been evacuated from the country ‘because it is dangerous.'

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that ISIS-linked groups will have American to deal with if they carry out more attacks in the war-torn country, which is split between Sunni and Shia Muslims.

U.S. officials 'had to relocate from Yemen because its a dangerous country,' Earnest said Monday. 'But I'll tell you, that as of today, Yemen remains a dangerous country for extremists as well.' 

Earnest said there continues to be continues to be 'ongoing security cooperation' between the U.S. and the 'national security infrastructure' of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whose power has been crippled in recent months after Shia rebels initiated a coup-d'etat.

The U.K. also pulled its special forces out of the country, following the United States' lead, leaving Hadi and his loyalists to face extremist and rebel threats to the country on their own.

The militiamen have reportedly been deployed around the city of Lahj, along the border with Taiz city which was captured one day ago by Shiite Houthi rebels.

According to local reports a day after Houthi rebels took over the strategic central city of Taiz, capturing several state facilities including the city's airport, airbase and a court complex, residents took to the streets to protest their presence

In pushing back against claims that the U.S. is flying blind in Yemen now that it's 'temporarily relocated' its special forces the president's spokesman assured reporters that the the country 'continues to have assets and resources in the region that will allow us to take steps where necessary to continue to apply pressure necessary to extremist targets and to keep the American people safe.'

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul had said a day before on ABC News program this week that the result of the complete withdraw is that 'we will have no intelligence footprint or capabilities to monitor' what Sunni al Qaeda affiliates, known in the country as AQAP, ISIS and Shia 'militants are doing in the region.'

'Good intelligence stops plots against the homeland,' he said. 'Without that intelligence, we cannot effectively stop it, that’s what I’m most concerned about.'

Earnest said Monday afternoon that its 'true' that he US would be a 'more effective' force against extremists if military personnel were still in the country - but it 'doesn't mean that coordination has been eliminated.' 

The White House said it has proven its ability to fight threats in other countries, including Syria and Somalia, without troops on the ground and it will do the same in Yemen.

The U.S, has already shown that it will take extremists 'off the battlefield in Yemen when they pose a threat to the United States.'

'Those efforts continue, and our capability to carry out those kinds of actions persists to this day as well.'

U.S. officials 'had to relocate from Yemen because its a dangerous country,' U.S. President Barack Obama's chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, said on Monday. 'But I'll tell you, that as of today, Yemen remains a dangerous country for extremists as as well.' The remarks follow the United States' removal on Saturday of special forces from the country

The White House's insistence that its counter terror strategy in Yemen, which the president propped up as a success story last year, and the region is still effective came after the country's security situation took a turn for the worse over the weekend.

On Friday four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 people and injured hundreds more when they walked into the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in the capital city of Sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country.

A fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques. 

ISIS has since taken responsibility for the attack, but the White House said Monday it has not seen evidence to support the group's claims. More likely, it said, is that ISIS is taking credit for the assault 'merely for propaganda value,' not because it had any direct involvement.  

Hundreds of members of al Qaeda also managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday.

In addition, Shia rebels that have taken over large parts of the country, the Houthis, issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight Yemenis loyal to embattled President Hadi. 

The U.S. and U.K. responded to the disturbances by recalling special forces from the country. 

CNN reports that Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force are among personnel who were at the Al Anad airbase in Yemen and have since been sent out of the country.

The United States had already closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. 

This after years spent working with Yemen in a quest to topple the terrorist organization al Qaeda, AQAP, in the Arabian Peninsula.

AQAP claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting earlier this year in Paris.

Further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. 

The Houthis are a Shia group that earlier this year gained power in the country after taking over the government in a struggle that some believe was funded by Iran. 

The White House says it does not know how much support Iran is providing the Houthis but it does not appear to be controlling their operational movements.

In January of this year, the Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, and by February they had taken control of the government. 

It was at that point most Americans were ushered out the country and the embassy was shuttered.

The Houthis launched a new strike against Hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of Aden, the country's temporary capital.  

That same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of President Hadi and Houthi rebels battled in the same city. 

Then on Saturday, the Houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of President Hadi following a speech he gave, one of his first in weeks, in which he accused rebels of carrying out 'a coup against constitutional legitimacy.'

He also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the Saudi city of Riyadh and announced a plan to place a national flag in the city of Sa'dah, the Houthi base.

Above all else he said he wanted unity for the country.

Sunday the United Nations' special envoy for Yemen to the international organization's security council that the country was on 'the edge of civil war. 

'Following the suicide bombings and fighting, emotions are running extremely high, and unless a solution can be found in the coming days the country will slide into further violent conflict and fragmentation,' the envoy, Jamal Benomar, said.

Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen on Monday reportedly asked the country's neighbors to help the government fend off rebels militarily.

The White House reaffirmed its belief on Monday that Hadi is 'the rightful leader of Yemen' and pointed to a United Nations statement issued over the weekend that echoed the policy position.

The U.S., Earnest said, hopes along with the international community that the Houthis will stop their rampage 'and participate in the UN-led effort to try to resolve the differences of all the parties there.'

Asked if the U.S. had plans to designate the Houthis as a terrorist group, Earnest directed reporters to the State Department.

'What we have been focused on are the serious concerns that we have about the destablizing activity of the Houthis,' he said of the president's advisers, and 'we could encourage both sides, including the Houthis, to put an end to the violence and come to the negotiating table.'

Should they decide to participate in the peace process, Earnest said the U.S. and the U.N. would be involved 'so that we can end the bloodshed, that we can end the violence, and try to bring some stability to this nation that's been racked by so much instability over the years.'
