A grandmother who won £7.5milllion in the National Lottery has spoken of plans to split her winnings with family members and maintain a modest lifestyle despite becoming a multimillionaire.

Doreen Hay had been buying lottery tickets for 10 years before her numbers came up after buying an extra Lucky Dip ticket on top of her usual two.

The 70-year-old from Thornaby, Teesside, plans to donate £1.5million to various charities and spend the rest of the money buying a new home and visiting the Lake District.

'You've got to win some time': The 70-year-old had been buying lottery tickets for ten years before her numbers appeared on a third Lucky Dip ticket she bought by chance

Speaking of the winning ticket, Mrs Hay said: 'I thought "you might as well be skint as broke, I'll get three"'.

Upon realising she had won the jackpot, the grandmother-of-three phoned her son who raced to over to her home.

'I checked the numbers three times. I couldn't believe it so I sat down and then checked again,' said John Hays, a former cable engineer.

'It was then I realised we'd won £7.5million'.

The 70-year-old previously won £1,300 when she drew five numbers in the jackpot won by Iorworth Hoare, a convicted rapist who won £7.2million on the day he was released from prison.

John Hay plans to give up his job as a cable engineer and use the money to find a home big enough for his family

'He was a convicted rapist and I thought: 'He has got the six and I've got five, but I'll get it next time.

'It's taken 10 years but I've got it. I'm a gambler, I like a little bet and you have to win some time haven't you?'

Mrs Hays, a retired cleaner, will split the money with her son, his three children and her seven brothers and sisters as well as donating a large sum of the prize to charity.

'I've £1.5million given away,' she said, adding : 'It's not (a lot of money) when you have £3.5million and I'm 70.

'I have no ambitions for a toyboy.'

The pensioner, who retired 17 years ago due to arthritis, plans to make more regular trips to the Lake District.

'I need to go away and come back on the same night,' said Mrs Hays who has never been on an airplane.

'I
 have been the same for 70 years, I don't know how to be any different,'
 she said before recalling her dinner the previous evening of fish 
fingers.

'I was pulling a face because I don't really like them, so I ate two and then shot the rest out for the seagulls.

'I thought "I'm worth £3.5million and I'm having fish bloody fingers for my tea.'

Mr Hays, who has given up his job, spoke of plans to buy a home big enough for his partner and three children.

The retired cleaner will give £1.5million to five different charities and spend the rest of the money on a new home, a pet poodle and trips to the Lake District

The 38-year-old is also planning a trip to Disneyland in Florida.

'Working outside in the cold? No more of that,' said the former cable engineer.

Mrs Hay will also give a share of the prize money to her former husband who she remains on good terms.

The pair divorced in 1987 because, she said: 'I used to nag him'.
