Anderlecht boss Besnik Hasi has accused Arsenal of underestimating his side in the teams' previous meeting and says his players have nothing to fear in their return Champions League fixture on Tuesday.

The Belgian side looked on course for a memorable victory over the Gunners two weeks ago as they led 1-0 with one minute of normal time remaining in Brussels, but goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski sealed a remarkable 2-1 win for Arsenal.

The result means Anderlecht have only one point - five fewer than Arsenal - in Group D, but Hasi has challenged his team to deliver a repeat of their excellent performance at the Emirates Stadium.

'I think Arsenal underestimated us in the first game, probably,' Hasi said.

'If you want to beat the top teams in the Champions League, you need to be at your top level and hope they are not at theirs.

'From our game two weeks ago, Arsenal get a mental boost after (what happened in the) the last three minutes.

'They have had a boost in confidence - you can see a few of their players are now playing much better.

'They want to win the game. If they win they can go through with nine points.'

Arsenal can guarantee their spot in the knock-out stages if they beat Anderlecht and Borussia Dortmund also win at home to Galatasaray.

The Gunners will be desperate to finish top of the group to avoid a difficult draw in the last 16, but manager Arsene Wenger said on Monday that Anderlecht can be an even more dangerous opponent on their travels than at home.

'I understand what Wenger is saying,' Hasi said.

'If you are a little team maybe you need to play counter-attacking football, but I don't think we have the qualities to play on the counter-attack.

'We have qualities to play football and I want my young team to really go for it against Arsenal - I want them to play their game and play without fear.

'If Arsenal are better than us, we will congratulate them, but in the first game I don't think we got what we deserved.'

The Gunners will be forced to field another makeshift defence with Laurent Koscielny (achilles) and Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) still out.

That means Nacho Monreal is likely to take his place at the heart of Arsenal's back four again, but Hasi believes the Gunners have more than enough quality to cope.

'If you look at our competition compared with the Premier League, I think they have all internationals, players at a higher level,' the Anderlecht boss said.

'I know Monreal's normal position is left-back, but he did a very good job in central defence. He is fast, he is strong - maybe against teams in the Premier League they have problems, but I don't think so in this group against us and against Galatasaray.

'You could say it is a handicap for them, but they have a lot of quality all over the pitch.'

Anderlecht have a number of injury problems of their own with influential midfielder Steven Defour, forward Matias Suarez, left-back Fabrice N'Sakala and centre-back Bram Nuytinck all struggling with injuries.
