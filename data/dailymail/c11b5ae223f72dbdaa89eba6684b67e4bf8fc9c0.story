Recovering alcoholic: Peter Singleton from Wakefield, was found guilty of being drunk on the job

A railway crossing keeper in charge of a level crossing was so drunk on duty he could not be woken up, a court heard.

Peter Singleton, 29, of Sandal, Wakefield, was warned he could face jail after being found slumped in his cabin as a passenger train waited on the track.

An ambulance was called after a colleague failed to rouse Singleton, who was supposed to be manning the control barrier at Doncaster Road, Wakefield, in West Yorkshire.

When he was eventually woken, he admitted he had drunk three pints of cider before he came on duty.

An
empty two-litre bottle of cider was found in his locker at work and 
Singleton admitted working on a railway while unfit through drink.

A
breath test showed he was nearly three times the drink-drive limit and 
just under eight times the strict Network Rail limit for employees.

The control barrier at Doncaster Road is used by 65 passenger, freight and express trains every day. 

A colleague arrived to take over from him at 8.15am on October 18 and noticed a passenger train waiting 250 yards up the line.

He expected the keeper to come out of his cabin to close the gate so the train could pass.

Diane Gomersall, prosecuting, told 
Wakefield magistrates: ‘He could see this defendant in his chair with 
his head back and his eyes rolled back.

‘The crossing is known to be the second busiest in Europe due to a nearby depot.’

The railworker pinched Singleton's ears and called his name to try and wake him but failed.

He then called an ambulance and Singleton was finally woken up.

He later told police he was a crossing keeper in a ‘safety critical’ role.

The court heard he was a recovering alcoholic and was also bulimic.

He had worked for Network Rail for six years and had up until that point had an exemplary record with the company.

Defending Mike Devlin, for Singleton, told the court; ‘He had no intention to drink at work that day. At some stage later on in the shift he did drink that cider.’

The crossing keeper has been suspended on full pay but accepts he will lose his job.

Bench chairman Barbara Phipps said the offence was made worse because he was virtually unconscious while doing a job which affected people's lives.

Singelton was warned he could face jail when he is sentenced later this month.
