The pesky credit card surcharges that ramp up the cost of purchases on flights, taxis, household bills, tickets and more could be chopped under recommendations to be put forward by Treasurer Joe Hockey this weekend.

Consumer campaign group Choice spokesperson Tom Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia it is just a matter of time before surcharges – which are estimated to cost consumers up to $800 million a year - are scrapped.

'We think the end is imminent. The government has signalled they've had enough and now it's time for some strong enforcement against companies,' Mr Godfrey said.

Mr Hockey wants the Reserve Bank of Australia to accept recommendations put forward in his Financial Service Inquiry report that call for a stop to hefty surcharges, the Herald Sun reports.

Under the recommendations retailers would only be able to charge the administrative cost of paying with card – limited to 12 cents or 0.5 per cent of the transaction value.

Currently, companies such as Telstra charge 2 per cents plus GST for card payments and airlines like Jetstar and Tigerair charge a whopping $8.50 per flight.

Choice spokesperson Mr Godfrey explained: 'The latest report is a damning blow for excessive surcharges in the industry - airlines, taxis, ticket sellers - anyone that administrates credit card sales on a large scale.

'Australia has had it very bad for a very long time. Choice has been running a long campaign to get rid of these fees... $800 million a year is what it’s costing consumers. A lot of money could be saved if the move is bought in and enforced.’

Mr Godfrey said the biggest offenders are the airlines.

'They have been flying high on credit card surcharging for years.'

In the meantime, he said consumers can avoid surcharges by looking for a 'fee free payment method' but he acknowledged consumers like the convenience of using their credit cards.

Former Commonwealth Bank executive David Murray is leading the Financial Service Inquiry, supported by Mr Hockey.

The Treasurer behind this year’s unpopular federal budget told the Herald Sun of the inquiry: ‘A major focus is consumer protection. We need to make sure Australians are as well ­informed as possible so they can make the right choices.’

However, this is not the first attempt to stop credit card charges.

In March 2013, Visa became the first company to ban Australian retailers from adding on fees for using their cards.

The airlines and the taxi industry did change the way they charged fees as a result.

Independent eftpos provider Tyro Payments said more than 36 per cent of Australian businesses, or 100,000 companies, impose some type of surcharge on a customer's bill.

This means the majority of companies - 64 per cent or 200,000 – are already doing the right thing for consumers.

In June 2012 the Reserve Bank of Australia said it had noticed an ‘increase in cases where surcharges appear to be well in excess of acceptance costs’. ‘The Bank intends that its variation will improve price signals by enabling a card scheme to address cases where merchants are clearly surcharging at a higher level than is justified for acceptance of its card products,’ it added.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Reserve Bank of Australia for comment on the latest claims. 

The Financial System Inquiry is aiming to establish a blueprint for the future of Australia's financial system. 

The inquiry has received more than 6500 submissions since its interim report, 5000 of which touched on the issue of credit card surcharges, AAP reports. 

Its findings will be released on Sunday, sixteen years since the last financial system inquiry.
