Jane and Peter Howes (pictured) are both accused of fraud. They are seen arriving at Bristol Crown Court. He denies five counts of fraud

A jealous son faked his mother’s signature to cheat his older brother out of a £1.5million inheritance, a court heard yesterday.

Peter Howes, 53, allegedly believed Jonathan, 55, was  the family favourite, and resented him for living in the Far East while he looked after their sick mother at home.

The family estate should have been split between the brothers. But Peter faked the signatures of his brother and mother Joyce to steal the money, the court heard.

He moved cash into an account held jointly with his mother, then siphoned it off into a personal account, using it to buy a stake in an online gaming company set up by a relative of his wife.

He claimed to have made a list of everything he spent looking after his mother, intending to get it ‘back off her’, the court heard.

When Joyce Howes, 81, died  in November 2011, Jonathan learned of the alleged deception from the family’s lawyers.

Peter was arrested and charged with five counts of fraud. His wife Jane, 51, denies one count.

Ed Burgess, prosecuting, said at the start of their joint trial  yesterday: ‘It is a case about a breakdown in a family, and who knows what lies behind it?

‘Peter Howes may well have thought, “My brother is off  living his life in Hong Kong or Singapore. I’m stuck here with mum. I will take what I can get my hands on”. There is some  talk of Jonathan always being the favourite son, and Peter and Joyce having a very difficult  relationship. But what is overwhelmingly obvious in this case is that he practised deceit.

‘In one case he was knowingly assisted by his wife in order to take money he knew he was not entitled to. Peter Howes was  taking for himself all of [Joyce’s] money in the last days of her life, although he knew full well that it was her intention that both the boys should benefit equally.

‘The total sums are just in excess of £1.5million.’

Bristol Crown Court heard the men’s father, Thomas Howes, set up a number of trusts in 2002. The brothers were told the assets should be ‘divided equally’, and Peter was made executor when their father died in August 2004.

He wound up one settlement, sending half – or £109,000 – to  his brother in Hong Kong and convincing him the rest of the money was still in the trusts.

But Peter then allegedly faked his mother’s and brother’s signatures to gain access to the money and close another settlement.

Couple moved his elderly mother into their Gloucester home while continuing to defraud her - court heard. His brother Jonathan, who lives in Singapore, denied claims he had been the favourite child growing up

The
 court was told his wife Jane countersigned one document. Handwriting 
experts said the  signatures were not Joyce and Jonathan’s, something 
neither defendant denies.

In
 2009, Joyce Howes fell badly at the family home in Bexhill-on-Sea, East
 Sussex. Her health deteriorated rapidly and she was forced to move in 
with the couple in Lechlade, Gloucestershire.

Peter
 then set up an online joint account for him and his mother, and 
transferred the proceeds of the estate into it. Bank records show the 
money was later moved to his own account. He also sold the family home 
for £1.1million. Jonathan gave permission by email, believing the money 
would be used to move his mother out of Peter’s home.

Jonathan,
 a lawyer, said Joyce had been unhappy with his brother. He said: ‘I 
remember  her saying, “Jane is very nice to me but I’m afraid Peter can 
be very cruel”.’

He added that the brothers were ‘treated exactly the same’.

Mr
 Burgess told the court: ‘This is not a case that a woman who had lost 
her mental faculties was exploited. Mentally . . . Joyce was competent, 
which explains why Peter Howes felt it necessary to resort to fraud.’

Peter denies all five charges. The trial continues.
