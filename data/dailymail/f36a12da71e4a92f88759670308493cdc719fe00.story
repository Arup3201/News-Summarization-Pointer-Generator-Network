This is the heartwarming moment a father and daughter have a dance-off at home, pulling some impressive pops and grooves as they move to the beat.

Bryan and seven-year-old Kimani, who go by the name #TeamCushandBabybop, filmed themselves doing the 'baby bop slide' in the living room.

A video of the duo from Chicago, Illinois, shows them moving in sync; 'slidin' to the right', 'slidin' to the right' and 'workin' those legs.'

The track was made by 26-year-old Bryan whose passion is to rap and write songs.

He is known on the rapping circuit as 'Mr Cush'.  

His daughter appears to have inherited his love of music and dozens of YouTube videos show her in action. 

'She's been the Bop Queen of Chicago since the age of five,' the proud father said.

He added that as a single father he wanted to get his daughter involved in what he loves, and now they perform together as a duo.

And it appears that they have a burgeoning fanbase, with Bryan's YouTube channel scoring more than 1.3million hits. 

Many viewers have deemed their recent performance of the 'baby bop slide' 'cute' and 'amazing.'

'Why are you two not on America's Got Talent yet?' one fan mused.
