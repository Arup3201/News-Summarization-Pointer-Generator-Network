Pandas at a Chinese zoo have been keeping cool in the searing summer heat - thanks to a new air conditioning unit in their enclosure.

Giant pandas Ya Yun and Exri love their new gadget at Changsa Zoo, in Hunan province, so much that they have been using a nearby window ledge to climb closer to its vent.

The cuddly animals have had to contend with temperatures exceeding 40C in recent weeks.

Zoo keeper Hu Sheng said: 'It was clear to see that they were uncomfortable with the heat so we moved a large air conditioner into their room.

'Now they take it in turns to climb up on to it and just chill out.

'Perhaps theyâ€™ll start asking for their food to be prepared in a certain way, too, or when the temperatures cool down some fancy bed linen.'

Pandas usually spend 12 hours a day munching away but in the heat there was a much more pressing matter - to cool down.

They are solitary bears when in the wild, usually preferring their own company when foraging in Chinese bamboo forests.

They are an endangered species, with less than 2,000 thought to be left roaming free in the cool forests that are their natural habitat.

They mostly eat bamboo, but in captivity are also enjoy being fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, leaves, oranges, bananas and other special treats.
