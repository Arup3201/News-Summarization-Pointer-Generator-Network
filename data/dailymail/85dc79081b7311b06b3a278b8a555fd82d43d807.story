A Polish priest holding rosary beads did 'not have a care in the world' when he decided to set off on foot down a motorway after he crashed his car.

Father Grzegorz Tomaszewski, 41, claimed he was looking for a petrol station where he could make a phone call to report the crash because he didn't have a mobile phone.

However, police caught him strolling down the middle of the busy A9 where cars had to swerve out of the way to avoid him.

Swiss driver Udo Maiers, 39, told local media: 'He was carrying a rosary in his hands and didn't seem to have a care in the world.Â 

'Who knows, maybe it helped him because he certainly took a few risks wandering down the road as he did.

'He left the road eventually after he spotted a vineyard and he went in there where I understand he was found by the police.'

Another driver said when she called the police and told them a priest carrying a rosary was walking down the middle of the motorway, they did not believe her at first.
