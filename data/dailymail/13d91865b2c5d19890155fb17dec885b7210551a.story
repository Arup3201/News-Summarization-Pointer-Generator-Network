It was around the time Ed and Amy Delaney were celebrating an anniversary that Mr Delaney found a giant mushroom in their backyard.

So instead of the traditional bouquet of flowers, he decided to surprise his wife with the fungus.

Wife Amy came downstairs and was taken aback by the mushroom the size of two basketballs.

'I walked in and his arms were literally filled with this huge, disgusting white mass,' Mrs Delaney told WILX.

But that's not all. Mrs Delaney found an even bigger mushroom in their yard a few days later. In total, the family spotted four giant mushrooms in their backyard.

An expert at Michigan State University identified the mushrooms as Calvatia Gigantea, commonly known as giant puffball mushrooms.

Monstrous mushrooms: Giant puffball mushrooms can grow to be as large as five feet in diameter and weigh as much as 44 pounds

Jonathan Walton an MSU professor of plant biology, says he's never seen a specimen this big.

Unfortunately for the Delaneys, the mushrooms aren't worth anything and Professor Walton doesn't advise eating them.

Giant puffball mushrooms look like giant rounds of fresh mozzarella, but they grow to about a foot in diameter. Some can grow as large as five feet in diameter and weigh as much as 44 pounds.

When the Delaney's daughter Madison Gomez had two of her friends over Friday, she told them about the mushrooms but they wouldn't believe her.

'I guess they didn't believe me, so I showed them and I guess they had second thoughts,' she said.
