Society bible Tatler has come under fire after encouraging children as young as 13 to flirt with their friends' fathers to secure invitations to lavish events.

The shocking advice, featured in an article entitled 'Ten Charm Rules', was published in the glossy magazine's supplement, Teen Tatler.

It advises teenagers to buy presents and 'flirt gently' with their friends' parents if they wish to be invited to 'swanky' holidays, dinners and country weekends.

Reader: Poppy Dinsey described the feature as 'Teen Tatler basically saying flirt with dads to get free holidays'

And it even goes so far to claim that the 'big secret to getting on in life' is to make other people's parents like you.

The article tells readers who are staying over at their friend's house to take a 'cunning present' - such as Prestat Rose & Violet Crèmes, which sell for £11.50 a box - for their parents.

It adds: 'At some point 
take half an hour out to flirt (gently) with the parent of the opposite 
sex and then write a witty thank-you letter — bingo, you're a winner.

'Soon,
 word will get out and you'll be invited everywhere — dinners, more 
country weekends, swanky holidays and so on, and so on...

Outrage: Rachel Jobes hit out at the article on social-networking site Twitter, saying: 'No words! #shocking'

'Another gem': Sam Wolfson retweeted an image of the piece, saying: 'Another gem from Teen Tatler'

'Think of it 
as essential homework for life. Hone your social-seduction techniques 
now and those same tools will serve you handsomely for ever.'

But the tenth lesson warns readers: 'Don't be a creep', adding: 'There is a fine line.'

Yesterday, Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming condemned the article, published in April, saying it was 'going down territory you shouldn't be going down'.

DO flirt with your friend's parents to secure invitations to 'swanky' holidays, dinners and country weekends.

DO give your friend's parents thank-you letters and 'cunning' presents, such as boxes of expensive chocolates.

DON'T be intolerant to food or insist on a 'no carb' diet.

DON'T wear improper shoes, such as 'fetid' Nike Airs or a 'yellowing' pair of Supergas.

DON'T be creepy.

The Brimingham Yardley MP told The Times: 'It's 
not really the sort of thing they should be encouraging.

'Being nice and polite is one 
thing, trying to create a sexual frisson between your friend's parents 
and your teenage self is at the very least ill-advised.

'I'm 
surprised that Tatler wish to encourage it.'

Twitter users also hit out at the piece, which goes on to advise children on how to eat - 'no intolerances or nocarb nonsense' - how to write a thank-you letter and what shoes to wear.

Poppy Dinsey described the feature as 'Teen Tatler basically saying flirt with dads to get free holidays', while Sam Wolfson added: 'Another gem from Teen Tatler.'

Rachel Jobes said: 'Flirt with friends' fathers to get on, No words! #shocking', and Emma-Louise Trooter wrote: 'I don't have enough words to suitably describe my disgust.'

Meanwhile, a user named Cathy simply said: 'I am speechless.'

Tatler magazine, founded in 1709 and relaunched in 1901, is renowned for its coverage of high society and aristocratic events.

Criticism: Lib Dem MP John Hemming said the article was 'going down territory you shouldn't be going down'

It has been criticised in the past for an article entitled 'Best Society Breasts', which contained photographs of 28 wealthy women.

Kate Reardon, 42, was appointed the 17th editor of the magazine in 2010.

A Tatler spokesman told MailOnline: 'If the Tatler feature is read in its entirety it is clear that we intended it to be light-hearted.

'We're sorry if the content has been taken out of context and apologise for any offence caused.'
