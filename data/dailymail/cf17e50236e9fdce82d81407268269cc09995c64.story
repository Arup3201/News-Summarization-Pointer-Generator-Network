EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker has ridiculed David Cameron’s failures in Brussels – and declared he was ‘not frightened’ of facing him down.

The Commission president said he was ‘not the type who trembles in front of prime ministers’ and warned Mr Cameron that he had ‘a problem’ with other EU leaders.

Mr Juncker’s remarks come as Mr Cameron battles to reduce the £1.7billion surcharge demanded by the EU to cover years of strong economic growth in the UK while Europe struggled.

Jean-Claude Juncker today suggested that David Cameron had an uphill battle to win over the other EU leaders in his battle to cut Britain’s contributions

The Prime Minister was stung last month after the budget demand was leaked during a Brussels summit.

Mr Cameron has vowed not to pay ‘anything like’ the £1.7billion being demanded by Brussels by  December 1.

He was slapped down by Angela Merkel at the summit two weeks ago when she told him that he had no choice but to pay the bill.

Mr Juncker today suggested that the Prime Minister had an uphill battle to win over the other EU leaders in the battle to cut Britain’s contributions.

Mr Juncker said: ‘I don't have a problem with David Cameron. He has problem with the other prime ministers.’

To cut Britain’s contributions Mr Cameron will have to convince France and Germany to take a hit on the amount of money they are expecting to get back.

The French government is in line for a £788.7million rebate, while Germany stands to receive £614million, following the recalculation of how well each economy in the EU has performed.

A meeting of EU finance ministers on Friday is expected to tell George Osborne that he must hand over the full surcharge by next month.

In return he is expected to be offered the chance to hand over the extra cash in interest-free instalments.

Mr Juncker today warned: “I'm not frightened of any prime ministers.

"I am a not a man who trembles before Prime Ministers or other senior figures. I accept people criticising the Commission, because I myself had many criticisms to make when I wasn't yet Commission president.

"But I do not accept unjustified criticisms, everybody needs to know that. There will no longer be attacks on the Commission without a reaction."

It came after he used his first press conference as Commission president appeared to single out Italian PM Matteo Renzi and Mr Cameron for criticism.

He told the European Parliament that he did not like the way that ‘certain prime ministers’ behaved after the demands for additional cash were revealed at last month's European Council summit.

‘I took notes and when I compared what they had said inside the room with what they said outside, they did not tally up,’ Mr Juncker told the Parliament.

Today he told reporters in Brussels: ‘I said yesterday at the Parliament that I am not the leader of a gang of anonymous bureaucrats, I am the leader of 28 political commissioners.

‘We are not bureaucrats, we are not civil servants, we are political people and therefore when anyone tries to take apart the Commission before it has even started its work, I will react.

‘But I have no problem with Mr Renzi, who I appreciate greatly. I don't have a problem with Mr Cameron. Mr Cameron has a problem with the other Prime Ministers.’

Responding to Mr Juncker's comment's, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: ‘Does the Prime Minister always put the interests of British citizens and British taxpayers first? Of course. He is going to keep doing that.

‘But he works very closely with his EU counterparts.’

Responding to reports that EU officials had suggested the UK could pay its £1.7 billion surcharge in a series of interest-free instalments, Mr Cameron's spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has made the point about the unacceptability of the scale of the bill that was presented.’

Mr Osborne has said he is ‘confident’ of securing a cut after Mr Cameron declared the UK would not pay ‘anything like’ the sum being demanded by the European Commission - which critics claim amounts to a tax on Britain's economic success.

The row came as the European Court of Auditors issued another scathing assessment of the handling of the EU £117 billion budget.

In a new report, the ECA said that between 3.5 per cent and 5.9 per cent of the EU budget - somewhere between £4 billion and £7 billion - was wrongly spent.

It also complained that the entire 2007/13 budget process was ‘too focused on just getting funds spent and needs to place more emphasis on achieving results’ - because of a ‘use it or lose it’ approach.
