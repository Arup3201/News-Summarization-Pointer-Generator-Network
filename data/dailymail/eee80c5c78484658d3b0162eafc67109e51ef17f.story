Prison guard Nancy Gonzalez, 30, faces up to 16 months in jail for having sex with inmate Ronell Wilson

A prison guard who thought having a child with a convicted cop killer would get him off Death Row faces up to 16 months behind bars today.

Nancy Gonzalez's last ditch plan to save Ronell Wilson's life didn't work and she is due to be sentenced in New York for having sex with an inmate.

The 30-year-old has already lost custody of the baby boy she gave birth to and her federal job at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.

Gonzalez and Wilson, 33, had sex while the convict
 was awaiting resentencing.

It happened after an appeals court threw out his first 
death sentence, handed down in 2007, on a legal technicality.

At a previous hearing, Gonzalez's attorney claimed the family of Wilson was manipulating her and blamed her for a jury condemning him to the death penalty.

Her child, which was conceived in an 'activity room' at the center while Gonzalez was working there, is named Justus and was born on March 21.

He was placed in foster care with Gonzalez's maternal aunt.

A
 family court judge found that Gonzalez's behavior was neglectful 
because Gonzalez, a recovering drug addict, was not allowed to use 
alcohol while free on bail.

Wilson was convicted of capital murder for shooting dead two undercover NYPD detectives during a 2003 gun bust.

He was sent to Death Row for a second time in September. Gonzalez refused to testify at his hearing.

Defense lawyer Anthony Ricco has asked Brooklyn Federal Judge Brian Cogan to sentence Gonzalez to probation so she can receive mental treatment, the New York Daily News reported.

Ricco said Gonzalez was sexually abused as a child and when she served in the military, leading her to engage in destructive sexual relationships 'to cope with stress and anxiety.'

Prosecutors said they suspected Wilson targeted Gonzalez and impregnated her so that he could use his child as an argument not to sentence him to the death penalty.

In court filings, Mr Ricco described his client as mentally unstable and vulnerable.

Gonzalez's pregnancy threw up a spanner in the works of the death penalty case against Wilson - though she ultimately refused to take the stand and testify on his behalf

The baby, Justus, was conceived in an 'activity room' at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn

He claimed that she had been sexually abused and raped by her step-father, her uncles and other men.

As an example of her emotional instability, Mr Ricco said that his client had sexual relations with eight other guards - some men, some women - during her two years working at Metropolitan Detention Center.
