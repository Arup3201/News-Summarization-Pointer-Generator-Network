A woman who was held hostage by a gunman in the terrorist siege at Sydney's Lindt cafe was forced to record a chilling video message by her captor with a list of demands.

Marcia Mikhael, who works as a Westpac executive, also warned via social media that Iranian-born gunman Man Haron Monis was 'threatening to start killing us' as she huddled with 17 other terrified hostages inside the Martin Place cafe on Monday afternoon. 

Ms Mikhael, 42, was one of several hostages forced to stand in front of a black Islamic flag and relay several demands required by the 50-year-old gunman who she referred to as 'The Brother'.

Marcia Mikhael, who works as a Westpac executive, was forced to record this chilling video message in front of a black Islamic flag as she was held hostage in the terrorist siege at Sydney's Lindt cafe

'This is a message to Tony Abbott. We're held here hostage and The Brother has three requests,' Ms Mikhael said in the video.

She said the gunman had demanded an Islamic State flag, to speak with the Prime Minister and to let the media know of two other bombs in the Sydney CBD in exchange for hostages. 

'We don't understand why these demands haven't been met yet, they are not unreasonable,' she said. 

Ms Mikhael, who also works as a fitness business owner, delivered a frightening eyewitness account from inside the cafe when she was also forced to post the demands on her Facebook page. 

'Dear friends and family,' she wrote.

'I'm at the Lindt café at Martin Place being held hostage by a member of the ISI. The man who is keeping us hostage has asked for small and simple requests and none have been met.

'He is now threatening to start killing us. We need help right now. The man wants the world to know that Australia is under attack by the Islamic State.' 

After roughly 16 hours huddled in the cafe, Ms Mikhael emerged shortly before 2am on Tuesday morning carried by two emergency service workers with blood pouring down her legs 

She was also forced to post a list of demands on her Facebook page saying the 17 hostages needed help

NSW Police were aware of the social media posts yesterday, but asked the media and the public not to share them as they tried to negotiate with the gunman.

Her family also called for people to include Ms Mikhael in your 'prayers not your posts'.

'Please do not share or spread any messages released by the hostages on fb as the terrorist is using them as a means of communication,' her niece, Christine Mikhael, wrote. 

'This could put my aunty and the others in grave danger.'

After roughly 16 hours huddled in the cafe, Ms Mikhael emerged shortly before 2am carried by two emergency service workers. 

Despite being visibly distressed and with blood pouring down her legs, Ms Mikhael's family described her being rescued as 'the best footage on TV for 2014'.

She was carried to a waiting ambulance wearing the same business suit she was pictured wearing in the chilling video. 

Two other hostages - a 34-year-old man and 38-year-old woman - were killed alongside gunman Man Haron Monis. 

The gunman first came to the attention of authorities when he started sending hate mail to the families of Australian dead soldiers between 2007 and 2009.

The 42-year-old works as a Westpac executive who has offices in Martin Place where the siege occurred
