A diver was given a rare treatment in a hyperbaric chamber to help him to recover from a near fatal diving accident on Lake Superior in Michigan.

Terry Begnoche, 64, from Michigan was in the chamber for 53 hours at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis to receive the treatment under the watchful eye of a nurse.

The chamber acted as a treatment room in which air pressure could be adjusted to give Begnoche a chance to clear out the damaging nitrogen bubbles he got following the dive that went wrong.

Chamber: Terry Begnoche lies in a hyperbaric chamber at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota after a diving incident in Lake Superior that almost killed him

Begnoche and other volunteers had dived on September 18 to capture footage of a ship off the coast of Grand Marais, Michigan according to The Star Tribune.

The divers used underwater lighting and a video camera to examine the recently discovered Nelson, a three-masted ship that sank off the coast of Grand Marais, Mich., in 1899.

However, on his way down to dive, Begnoche forgot to put on weights. 

And whilst down there, he only had 20 minutes worth of oxygen to use as he dived to see the ship.

After 19 minutes he started to rise from the depths of the lake and pointed a video camera back down at the ship on the lake’s floor as he ascended. 

But as he climbed, he soon realized  how rapidly he was rising past another diver.

With over 40 years of experience he knew there was nothing he could do.

Treatment: Terry Begnoche is brought into a hyperbaric chamber which heals patients by creating an oxygen-rich environment for severe wounds or conditions such as anemia or carbon monoxide poisoning

After he was hauled into the boat, he told the crew that he had lost control of his arms and legs and could feel prickly sensations in his body.

A Coast Guard helicopter was called along with a boat from the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Rangers.

The national Divers Alert Network assessed his injuries and referred him to HCMC.

During treatment, doctors suggested that his quick ascent from the water had caused nitrogen bubbles to form in his bloodstream, cutting off blood to his spinal cord and other parts of his body.

Begnoche said: ‘What I was worried most about was holding my breath if I panicked, because that could have caused a fatal embolism in his lungs. Panic is what really kills people.’

Medics had to fly Begnoche on a low-altitude flight to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis after he lost blood following the expedition.

There, doctors immediately tried a rare treatment which they uncovered in a U.S. Navy Diving Manual.

Dr. Chris Logue, medical director of HCMC’s center for hyperbaric medicine told The Star Tribune: ‘It’s really rare to have to do that protocol for a couple reasons. One is that most people die. They never make it to treatment.’

According to doctors, Begnoche's body had become like a 'human soda bottle' that had been shaken up but still had the top on it holding everything inside. 

So they opted to treat him with the hyperbaric chamber.The chamber used is known to mimic a depth pressure of 45 feet to 60 feet below the surface.

Doctors had to make the chamber a depth of 165 feet which was only 10 feet above the chamber’s maximum limit to mimic Begnoche’s actual dive depth. 

It was hoped that the treatment would help get the nitrogen in his body from bubbles into a solution and allow it to escape his body slowly and safely.

If Begnoche had come out of the lake slowly this would have occurred naturally. 

However, when the chamber reached its maximum depth, Kimberlee Nerling, a nurse who was inside the chamber with him said she saw Begnoche begin to move his arms.

He has since regained control of his movements but cannot walk or move his legs.

He continues to receive treatment in the hopes that he will be able to improve over time.

But it is still unknown whether he will make a full recovery.

‘It’s such a rare event, it’s impossible to tell,’ Logue said. ‘What we’ve gained back, I’m thrilled about.’
