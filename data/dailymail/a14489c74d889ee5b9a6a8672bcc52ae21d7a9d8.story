Britain is the world leader in the use of mobile internet, thanks to an explosion in smartphone sales, social media, online videos and music downloads.

We have even overtaken tech-savvy Japan in mobile internet use, according to figures from media regulator Ofcom, which has compared data from 17 of the world's most developed nations.

A report released today shows UK consumers download a record 424 megabytes of data each every month, an astonishing 60% jump from 2011.

On the move: Britain's obsession with checking our Facebook and Twitter profiles on the go has seen it become the world leader in mobile internet use

Telly addicts: UK consumers use more online TV catch up services than any other nation, and increasingly use mobile devices to access them

Much of the rise is down to our heavy use of Facebook and Twitter. A total of 40% of UK adults check their profiles on their phones, rising to 62% among 18-24-year-olds.

There has also been a spike in the use of on-demand TV services such as BBC iPlayer and Channel 4's 4OD.

A quarter of all Brits now use them to watch their favourite shows every week, well ahead of second-placed America, where 17 per cent tune in on their phones, laptops and tablets.

However, total time spent online has dropped from 746 minutes a week in the last report to 728 minutes. Australia dominates in sheer volume of hours on the net, with 992 minutes a week.

Britain is also a nation of internet shopaholics with the average consumer spending more than £1,000-a-year on the web.

Internet shopping is now more popular in the UK than any other major country in the world, according to the report.

It found that in 2011, the average Briton spent £1,083 purchasing products online, up 14 per cent in 2010 and up 46 per cent on 2007 figures.

The closest other 'big spenders' were Australians, who spend £842 per head each year, and the Swedish, who spend £747 annually.

Sensation: The increasing popularity of watching Youtube on mobiles is another factor in the rise. South Korean music video Gangnam Style has nearly a billion views online

And the British are among the most likely to make internet purchases from their mobile phones. A total of 23% have visited a retail website on the move, narrowly ahead of Germany on 22.6%.

James Thickett, Ofcom’s Director of Research, said that the UK’s tradition for searching for bargains through catalogue shopping, meant consumers were more open to purchasing products remotely, such as iTunes, cinema tickets, games and even clothes among the most popular purchases.   

He added that the country had long been one of the fastest to embrace technological change.

Mr Thickett explained: ‘We have a long history of catalogue shopping in the UK, and as many daily activities are increasingly carried out online, the internet has become the new destination for many shoppers.’

Dance: The popularity of Music download sites like iTunes and Spotify have also contributed to the rise in mobile internet

In its research Ofcom also found that, more than any other nation in Europe, Britons like to shop on the move.

James Murray, digital insight manager at Experian, said Christmas 2012 was on track to be another ‘record-breaker for online retail, out-stripping 2011 on all fronts’.

He added: ‘The current market trends suggest that in the UK, Monday December 3 will be the biggest pre-Christmas day for online retail, with an estimated 115million visits to online retail outlets and a massive 15million hours spent online shopping on this day alone.’

Experian also expects the next two Mondays to post significantly higher sales than the equivalent dates last year.

British consumers will spend 375million hours shopping online in December, 32million more hours than last year, Experian says.

Last year was a record-breaking year in terms of online retail. Shoppers made 2.18billion visits to retail websites and spent 343million hours shopping online.

The boom in online shopping comes at a time when the British high street is still suffering because of the economic downturn. 

Retail chains are closing their shops at a rate of more than 30 a day across the UK as the economic downturn continues, according to research.

Figures show that across the UK embattled retailers closed 32 stores a day in July and August up from 20 a day in the first six months of 2012.

High-profile administrations this year of major retailers include Past Times, Clinton Cards, and Peacocks, according to the study of 500 town centres by retail industry specialist, the Local Data Company.

UK consumers use more mobile data than any other nation in the world

Despite the increased popularity of browsing and shopping on the web, a recent investigation by the Daily Mail found that Christmas shoppers may be paying too much buying presents online. 

Prices fluctuate by as much as ten per cent each day - the figures show that instead of prices being fixed unless there is a sale, as many assume, they can vary by the hour as retailers try to ensure they are the cheapest.

It suggests that getting the best price when shopping online is a matter of luck and customers could end up paying a lot more if they buy at the wrong time.
