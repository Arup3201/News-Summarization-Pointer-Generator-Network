The list is featured in the twelfth edition of Inspire, the terror group's propaganda magazine

Al-Qaeda has published a chilling list of its top bombing targets, including London's prestigious hotel, The Savoy.

In the twelfth issue of Inspire, the magazine published by the terror group, it calls for bombers to attack crowded areas and provides a country-by-country break down of suggested sites.

For the UK, these include football matches, the Cheltenham Festival and The Savoy.

One of London's most famous hotels, 
The Savoy has been a regular haunt for celebrities throughout its 115 
year history, making it a high-profile target.

The
 magazine encourages readers to build their own car bomb - which it 
provides instructions of how to do - and detonate it outside the hotel.

It suggests carrying out the attack at 10pm when, it says, 'high profile targets' will be exiting.

According to the article, this is 'a perfect place and time to detonate your car bomb.'

A
 spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said counter-terrorism officers 
monitor the magazine closely but would not release details of any 
additional security measures.

He said: 'The MPS Counter Terrorism Command is aware of the website and appropriate steps have been put in place.

'As part of our continued work, we regularly work with, and support, industry and crowded places with a variety of briefings and advice.'

Both the Savoy and the company that manages it, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, were contacted but no one was available for comment.

An article about dead cleric Anwar al-Awlaki quotes him defending the killing of civilians

The majority of the targets listed in the magazine, published this week by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, are in America but there are others from the UK, France and 'other crusader countries'.

Suggestions for attacks include Bastille Military Day Parade and the Louvre art gallery, both in Paris, Sears Tower in Chicago and popular holiday destinations for western tourists, such as the Dordogne.

The magazine carries an article about Al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a US drone strike in 2011. In the piece, al-Awlaki is quoted justifying the killing of civilians by saying: 'Soldiers are expected to dieâ€¦ But a civilian is not. So when you you hit the civilian you hit them where it hurts and that is what our tactics are about.'

As well as these sort of instructions, the magazine contains practical advice on how to carry out an attack.

These include methods of making bombs, which it claims can be made with easily accessible items and are simple enough to be followed 'in the kitchen of your mom.'

The magazine's letter from the editor mocks the American government for failing to be able to 'protect its citizen from pressure cooker bombs in backpacks,' a reference to the attack on the Boston marathon in April 2013.

It goes on to ask: 'I wonder if they are ready to stop car bombs.'
