Pope Francis was given the rock star treatment as he arrived for an audience at the Vatican.

The crowd cheered and screamed with joy as the Pope entered the large hall that was filled with Catholics, with followers reaching out to touch him as he passed them by.

Women could be seen crying as the Pontiff stopped to shake hands with members of the thousand-strong crowd and plant kisses on the cheeks of children.

More than a thousand people gathered to hear the Pope speak about the Mafia in southern Italy 

The head of the Catholic Church then made his way on to the stage, from where he gave a powerful speech urging members of the Mafia to repent.

The Pope was speaking during an audience for pilgrims and anti-crime activists from the southern region of Calabria, home to the 'Ndrangheta - mainland Italy's equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia.

He said the Church would welcome them in if they promised to put their criminal lives behind them.

'Open your hearts to the Lord. The Lord is waiting for you and the Church will welcome you if your willingness to serve good is as clear and public as your choice to serve evil was,' Pope Francis said. 

When he visited Calabria last June, he accused organised crime groups of practising 'the adoration of evil'.

The 'Ndrangheta, which makes most of its money from drug trafficking, is spread over 30 countries. 

The group is said to have an annual revenue of £44billion - equivalent to about 3.5 per cent of Italy's total economic output. 

The Pope also met German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Vatican today, where the two heads of state discussed the conflict in Ukraine and the fight against poverty.

The meeting, which was the second between the two since Francis' election as Pope in 2013, was described as 'very cordial'.

Francis presented Merkel with a medallion depicting Saint Martin giving his coat to the needy, saying it served as a reminder to world leaders that their job is 'to protect their poor.'

Merkel responded: 'We try to do our best.' 

He also gave her a copy of his teachings Evangelii gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel), translated into German.

Merkel gave the pope an envelope containing a donation to help children fleeing conflicts in the Middle East. She also presented the Pontiff with a collection of music by Johann Sebastian Bach.

She told reporters that their discussions were ''wide-ranging, as expected,' covering Ukraine, poverty, the role of women in developing countries and gender equality.

'I was very happy to meet with the pope. He gave me a lot of encouragement,' she added.
