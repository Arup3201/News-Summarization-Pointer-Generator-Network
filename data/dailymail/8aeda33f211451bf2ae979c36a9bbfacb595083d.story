This mouse had a lucky escape when its scavenging expedition nearly saw him completely toast.

The rodent had climbed inside a toaster in search for crumbs but got into trouble once it had finished his dinner.

When it tried to get out of the kitchen appliance it got its legs trapped wire mesh - which was lived wired to the mains.

"Cheesus, I thought I was toast!": The mouse was found stuck insite the toaster with its legs trapped in the wire mesh

Fortunately for the mouse, the owner 
of the toaster heard its terrified squeaks before she put her bread in 
to grill, and called RSPCA.

RSPCA Animal Collection Officer Zenon Brown, who was called to the rescue in Catford, London, said: ‘This little fellow was quite lucky really.

‘The
wire mesh he was caught in was connected to live wire and it is not 
worth thinking about what would have happened had this lady not heard 
the squeak.

True mouseketeer: After rescuing the crumb-thief, RSPCA found it had sustained no injuries and it was released back into the wild

‘There was no 
way he would have been able to free himself without any help, but I 
managed to get his legs unstuck and he was unharmed - hopefully just 
well fed on the crumbs.

‘Mice can get themselves into some small corners but I have never actually had to rescue one from a toaster before.’

The mouse was examined after the rescue and found to be unhurt. He has now been released back to the wild.
