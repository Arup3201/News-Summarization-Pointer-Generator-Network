Passport staff were left incredulous today after it emerged the civil service boss who has overseen this year's unprecedented holiday chaos has been nominated as a 'leader of the year' at a respected awards ceremony. 

Paul Pugh, who admitted to MPs that he considered resigning over the 500,000 backlog of passport applications which he has allowed to build up ahead of the summer getaway, is up for the award in tonight's influential 'Investors in People' awards.

The revelation comes just days after the £104,000 a year boss was slammed by MPs for losing control of the passport application backlog - threatening to ruin up to 55,000 family holidays.

Passport Office chief Paul Pugh, who earns £104,000 a year, told MPs that up to 55,000 people will not get their travel documents in time

Mr Pugh, who is not expected to attend the lavish ceremony at the five star Landmark Hotel in central London tonight, last week admitted to MPs that he had considered resigning over the chaos at the Passport Office.

It came after he admitted to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that the backlog of passport applications had almost doubled in just three months this year. 

Mr Pugh admitted 480,000 people were waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than at the same time last year.

The Passport Office boss blamed a 'substantially higher intake' of applications for the backlog amid hostile questioning from MPs.

But unions told MPs the figure was even higher. By June 8 the number of people waiting for their passport had hit 493,289, union chief Mike Jones told the Home Affairs Select Committee. Just 12 weeks earlier, the figure stood at 289,892. 

Mr Pugh apologised to families who suffered delays in their passport applications. He said: 'I absolutely recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.'

PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka, whose union represents Passport Office staff, slammed the decision to nominate Mr Pugh for a 'leadership' gong.

He said: 'This isn't just unfortunate timing, it's an insult to his staff who have been working all hours to clear backlogs caused by cuts and to the public who have been left stranded without a passport.'

Amid mounting fury over the passport delays the Government was forced to take urgent action to deal with the crisis.

Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog

The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham

Those who desperately need travel documents were told that they could get their applications fast-tracked free of charge, instead of paying an extra £55.50 a person.

But this will only apply to those who have not had their passports back within three weeks and are going abroad in the next seven days.

Minister also announced that those renewing their UK passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12-month extension.

Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get.

Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service.

The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved.

Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved.

The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application.

But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free.

British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents.

And families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents as well, the Home Secretary announced.

But it emerged last week that nearly three quarters of countries will not accept the 12 month emergency extensions.

Only 50 countries have confirmed they will accept the extended passports. Popular travel spots including Australia, China, India and World Cup host country Brazil are excluded from the list that was published on the Government website 'gov.uk'.

The USA, Cyprus and Turkey – which were last year on the list of the seven most popular overseas holiday destinations for Brits – are not allowing the emergency passports.

The Passport Office has increased the number of examiners and call centre staff by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high.

The Government's attempt to head off the growing crisis came after MailOnline published pictures showing hundreds of boxes of passport applications piled on a sorting office floor.

Passport office workers have also been forced to speak out over the pressure they are being put under to clear the backlog.

One whistleblower said workers were being left 'suicidal'. He said Mrs May did not have 'any idea' how bad the situation really was and claimed staff were at breaking point.

Speaking anonymously, he said he had been working seven days a week for four months to clear the estimated 500,0000 backlog of applications.

He said: 'We're tired, we can't concentrate. Theresa May hasn't got any idea. She doesn't now how bad things are.'

The whistleblower was asked about the morale at the Passport Office. The worker said: 'It's suicidal. Suicidal. The staff are worn out.

'Management keep changing the goal posts. They come up with crazy ideas and say how can we help, but they don't have a clue.

'The overnight staff are only supposed to work until 9pm, but they are working till midnight. I'm just so tired.

'I just want people to know the truth. I'm worn out, really worn out and it's been going on for far too long.'

He added that the Passport Office in Durham was 'a million times worse' than in Liverpool. He added: 'It's really bad - they are way behind.'

The worker said that yesterday morning a woman 'burst into tears because of the pressure they're putting on us'.

Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed
