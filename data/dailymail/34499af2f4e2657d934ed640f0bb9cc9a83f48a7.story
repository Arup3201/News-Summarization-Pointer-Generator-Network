Tony Pulis says Crystal Palace have not finished in the transfer market – but says they will not repeat the mistakes of last season.

Palace have signed Fraizer Campbell and Brede Hangeland this summer as well as extending Marouane Chamakh’s contract.

Head scratching: Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis

And Pulis is looking to strengthen his squad even further within the next month after missing out on Gylfi Sigurdsson and Steven Caulker.

Pulis saw strikers Glenn Murray and Chamakh score in the friendly defeat at Brentford while Campbell netted a hat-trick in a simultaneous friendly at non-League side Forest Green Rovers.

Pulis said: ‘We have a month left of the transfer window. It does not close when the season starts so there is still plenty of time.

‘But one thing is for sure is that we won’t be signing loads of players on the final day of the window like we did last year.’

Palace signed four players on the final day of the summer transfer window last season under Ian Holloway and then Pulis left it late to add four more on the final day of the January window.

After being one of the surprise packages in the Premier League last season finishing 11th, Pulis is clear what his aim is this season.

He added: ‘The aim is to stay in the Premier League. That would be brilliant.’
