It took a jury only a day of deliberation to find Jae Williams guilty of the first-degree murder Wednesday in what prosecutors called the thrill-killing of 15-year-old high school classmate Michael Russell  in 2009.

Williams, now 20, wept as the jury read their verdict. His family was in tears before the verdict was even read.

Williams, tried as an adult, will be sentenced on July 11.

Jae Williams appears in court Wednesday for a guilty verdict that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Williams was found guilty of first-degree murder Wednesday in the thrill-killing of a 15-year-old Santa Teresa High School

According to prosecutors, Williams was only 15 when he and alleged accomplice Randy Thompson went to Russell's home carrying knives.

The pair lured him outside with the promise of marijuana, then tacked the boy, stabbing him repeatedly and even chocking him until he was dead in the backyard of his South San Jose home. 

Thompson, 16 at the time of the homicide, will stand trial now that Williams' case is finished.

Both boys face life sentences.

More than 70 people filled the courtroom for the verdict, including San Jose police detectives who got William's confession and District Attorney Jeff Rosen.

As Thompson's trial is pending, they declined comment on the verdict.

In a videotaped confession recorded just 48 hours after Michael was killed, Williams said he and Thompson were involved in Satanism and had already beaten a cat to death.

'I guess I just finally wanted to kill somebody,' he said. 'I had my chance and took it.' San Jose Mercury News quoted him.

Alleged accomplice accomplice Randy Thompson will be tried next month. The pair allegedly lured their victim out of his house by promising him marijuana

In his confession, Williams described his role in several different ways, ranging from only watching Thompson attack Michael to pinning the boy down himself and slitting his throat.

Regardless of whether he actually attacked the boy or simply aided Thompson, prosecutor Valerie McGuire told jurors in her closing arguments that he was guilty of premeditated murder.

Other evidence included a chef's knife stolen from Thompson's kitchen and covered in Michael's blood, and a sweatshirt with William's DNA and Michael's blood.

Williams claimed he disposed of the weapon, sweatshirt, and one other blood-stained jacket in a dumpster.

Police later recovered the items in nearby bushes.

Defense attorney Lewis Romero argued that it was the Thompson family that carried our the murder and that they had engaged in a coverup to frame Williams.

Romero presented witnesses arguing that Williams gave a false confession, partially because he was sleep deprived in a holding cell.

Prosecutors said Williams and an accomplice named Thompson lured classmate Michael Russell outside his home, then choked and stabbed him to death

However McGuire argued that Michael was in fact 'butchered' by the two defendants, having been stabbed at least a dozen times.

Causes of death after the six-minute attack was listed as stabbing and asphyixiation.

Michael's uncle would later discover his body and attempt to revive him.

In close, Romero asked for an acquittal arguing that he is opposed to 'locking children up in adult cages for the rest of their lives.'

As jurors are barred from weighing potential sentences in their decisions, they were ordered to discount the remark.
