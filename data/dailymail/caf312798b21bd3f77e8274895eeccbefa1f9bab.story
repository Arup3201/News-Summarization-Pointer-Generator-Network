Defender Johnson was the overall winner as the England international scored both his Lacrosse shots while Josh Hawkins had the best penalty record of the lacrosse players, scoring once.

Having come out on top, Liverpool will be hoping to be victorious in their next challenge as they take on arch rivals Manchester United in Miami on Monday night.

Johnson is looking forward to meeting the Red Devils in the International Champions Cup final and believes such a game will stand Brendan Rodgers' side in good stead for the upcoming campaign.

Speaking 
to the LFC Tour website, the 29-year-old said: 'When you're at a top 
club, you need to be playing the best teams because they're the ones 
you're going to be fighting with throughout the season. It has been a 
fantastic pre-season.

'It will 
be great for the fans and we're certainly looking forward to it. They're
 a massive club as well so I'm sure the fans will turn up and make it a 
good night.

'Although 
it's pre-season and the main thing is to get fit, we've started the way 
we finished last season. That has pretty much been the philosophy for 
the whole time.

'We're 
playing Champions League sides in every game, so it's brilliant for 
keeping your level where it needs to be and keeping fitness levels high.
 It's looking good.'
