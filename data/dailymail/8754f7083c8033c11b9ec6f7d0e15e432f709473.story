Accused: Sean Patrick Banks, 37, has been charged with raping a second woman

A former Navy lieutenant accused of raping a woman he met through a Christian dating website has now been charged with attacking a second woman.

Sean Patrick Banks, 37, from Del Mar, California, has already been accused of sexually assaulting a 
woman he met through ChristianMingle.com last November.

Banks allegedly arrived at the home of 
his date, a woman in her 20s, on November 12, was sexually aggressive 
towards her and ultimately forced himself on her, the prosecution said.

Two more charges of 
sexually assaulting another victim when she was drunk and of attempting to 
dissuade a witness, a Miss California 2012 pageant contestant, from talking to police have been filed against him.

The latest rape victim has claimed she met Banks for drinks in 2009, then engaged in sexual activities to which she did not consent. It is not known if the two met through the site.

Authorities said Banks used a fake name 
on the site to contact the woman he allegedly raped in 
November. He allegedly used names including 'Rylan Butterwood' and 'Rylan Harbough'.

Banks, a PhD student at Pepperdine 
University, had been arrested on February 11 on a slew of counts, including rape
by force, digital penetration by foreign object and residential 
burglary for the 2012 attack. 

Popular site: Kinney said she met Banks on the site ChristianMingle.com, where the man allegedly used different aliases

The second new charge stems from his alleged contact with Miss California contestant Victoria Kinney, who claims he threatened her and intimidated her against speaking to police.

Kinney, who met Banks on the Christian site, said he was very charming at first, 
and she got the impression that he was a very intelligent, eloquent, 
well-read, good Christian man, according to 10News.

But in retrospect, she said that some of his remarks were unsettling. 

'I didn’t listen to my instincts,' she said. 'In those instances and looking back, I absolutely should have.' 

It all came to a head when Kinney said she got a call from Banks, whom she planned to meet for lunch, telling her that he had been arrested on a rape charge.

After the 37-year-old suspect was released on bail, Gilleon said he reached out to Kinney, trying to silence her.

Gilleon told ABC News that Banks ordered Kinney ‘to first tell him’ if authorities contacted her about him, and that she not speak to them.

‘I started crying hysterically because I realized how close to something horrible that I had come,’ Kinney said.

Kinney's attorney, Daniel Gilleon, 
said his client was terrified, but being a devout Christian woman, she 
was determined to testify against Banks in order to support other 
possible victims.

Addressing Kinney’s claims that she 
could have been Banks’ next victim, his attorney Gretchen von Helms sad 
that the woman has never met her client in person, and their 
relationship was limited to talking on the phone and texting.

During the hearing, Judge Charles Ervin granted Kinney an order of protection barring Banks from having contact with or getting within 100 yards of the beauty queen.

The suspect was re-arrested on a rare 'no bail request,' even though he had previously posted $500,000 bail. Banks faces 44 years in prison if convicted. He is due back in court for a preliminary hearing March 26.
