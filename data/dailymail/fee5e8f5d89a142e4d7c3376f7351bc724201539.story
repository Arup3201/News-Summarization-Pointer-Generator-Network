England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster took part in a high-powered sports think-tank involving Roy Hodgson and Sir Dave Brailsford at Pennyhill Park this week.

The summit at the resort hotel outside Bagshot, Surrey, was organised by the Leaders in Sport brand, allowing elite coaches to get together in a private environment to swap ideas and strategies. 

The venue was chosen so that Lancaster could play a part despite being in the middle of a crucial international week that culminates in a Test against Australia on Saturday after a disappointing autumn series.

There will be some surprise within rugby that Lancaster, who regularly speaks on leadership topics, wanted to participate in such a meeting during England’s run of four November games.

The organisers, who put on their P8 summits loosely based on the G8 political meets in the UK and the US, said Lancaster ‘popped in’ when he could during the Wednesday session, between his rugby duties on the squad’s day off.

As well as Lancaster, Brailsford and Hodgson, the P8 included UK Sport director of performance Simon Timson and Andy Walshe who heads Red Bull’s high-performance athlete development programme.

The William Hill Sports Book of the Year award went once again — as Sports Agenda predicted — to an obscure tome, this time about the rape trial of an Australian Rules footballer, rather than either of the acclaimed front runners, Gareth Thomas’s autobiography and the Bobby Moore biography.

The elitist panel, as they have done for most of the last 26 years judging this prestigious award, much prefer to be different rather than populist. The first prize includes a free £2,500 bet which last year’s winning author Jamie Reid safely staked on UKIP winning the Rochester by-election at odds of 1-10.

Northumberland FA’s belated decision to sever all links with 77-year-old vice-president John Cummings after his sexist remarks should lead to the FA revising their scandalous decision to allow referee grandee David Elleray to remain in office following racist comments to a black colleague.

The county FA made a U-turn on not taking further action against Cummings after he was banned for four months by the FA for telling junior referee Lucy May that a woman’s place was in the kitchen.

So the FA should think again about Elleray, who was playing an active role in this week’s rules-governing International Football Association Board meeting in Belfast, after he was only slapped on the wrist for asking a black colleague whether his tan was the result of going down a coal mine.

Lord Coe has turned to bid spinmeister Mike Lee, who helped London 2012 across the line, in his quest for the IAAF presidency. Lee knows all the machinations of such a campaign with successes including Rio landing the 2016 Olympics and the unlikely appointment of Brian Cookson as chief of cycling’s UCI.

BEEFY TIPPED FOR UKIP

UKIP will be targeting Labour leader Ed Miliband’s seat in Doncaster after research published yesterday showed they could win it. This adds more intrigue to a fascinating rumour that UKIP will approach Yorkshire-based right-winger Sir Ian Botham to contest the seat.

Sky Sports pundit Botham said curtly he wouldn’t discuss such ‘garbage’ while cricket is mourning Phillip Hughes. 

Cricket-loving UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who describes Sir Ian as his ultimate hero, said he knew nothing about any such approach, but added: ‘I don’t know everything that goes on in my party but I would be over the moon if it happened.’

The three current FIFA ExCo members, as Sports Agenda revealed, still being investigated by American lawyer Michael Garcia over corruption relating to World Cup bids are Spain’s Angel Maria Villar Llona, Belgium’s Michel D’Hooghe and Thailand’s Worawi Makudi. Serial corruption allegations surround Makudi, Villa Llona headed Spain’s alleged vote collusion with Qatar and D’Hooghe’s involvement suggests Belgium’s bid was not as squeaky-clean as reported.
