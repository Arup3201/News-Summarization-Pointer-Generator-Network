Comedian Russell Brand has taken aim at the Australian government, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the mainstream media following Monday's siege at the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place.

Brand criticised the way gunman Man Haron Monis was branded a terrorist by some media outlets, saying instead he was simply a mentally ill criminal.

'This man is clearly a mentally ill criminal with a long history of mental illness and criminal behaviour and lots of evidence of instability,' Brand said in a video posted to Youtube as part of his Trews series.

Comedian Russell Brand has weighed in on the media coverage surrounding the siege in Sydney

'By us labelling him a terrorist rather than a dangerous mentally ill person - not that all mentally ill people are dangerous, I'm mentally ill - and by allowing him to set the agenda "I'm doing this on behalf of Islam" it gives a certain grandeur to nihilistic and violent actions but what's more interesting than the actions of a mentally ill person is the response of the political establishment,' he continued.

The comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame, amid worldwide fears about Islamic State.

'It's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around ISIL because currently there's an appetite to increase security measures domestically, to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends.'

Brand criticised media reports that claimed gunman Man Haron Monis was a terrorist with links to ISIS

Monis kept 18 people captive for many hours until police stormed the cafe in the early hours of Tuesday

Brand dispersed Australian news reports and addresses from Mr Abbott in between his statements, and made the claim that terrorism is more a structure upheld by governments as a tool of power than anything else.

'Terrorism is continually used as a tool to control a domestic population. I'm not saying there aren't a lot of dangerous people out there, I'm saying a lot of those people are in government,' he said.

Australia's new terror and metadata laws were also up for discussion, with Brand saying giving authorities the immunity from prosecution is very dangerous, especially in light of recent information surrounding the CIA and torture claims.

Brand also claimed Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the government used the situation to fit their own framework

But he did acknowledge that 'we' need to pull together in times such as these 

He however ended his bulletin on a more positive note, saying the #illridewithyou hashtag was 'an offer of solidarity'.

'We have at this point got to pull together more than ever, when people control the media like Rupert Murdoch who says things like "Egyptians being white, all the Egyptians I know are white",

'Of course what's happened in Australia is sad and of course there's dangerous things going on in the world but our media uses that danger to suit their ends.

'It's really important in this time of division and fear that we embrace one another. Us, the normal people in the middle, embrace one another. Forget the extremists are either end of the social scale, whether they are motivated by religion or money or desire for power, and us, the ordinary people that want to make connections, have a right and a duty, in fact, to define the way we see reality,' Brand concluded.
