Smoking: The habit is related to respiratory diseases and cancer

One in every 20 hospital beds are taken up by someone with a smoking-related illness, figures revealed yesterday.

Every day 1,260 adults aged 35 and over are admitted to hospital due to smoking, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.

It says that between 2010 and 2011 there were 460,000 hospital admissions in England attributable to smoking.

Of these, 126,200 had a respiratory disease, representing one in four of all patients with such a condition.

Some 160,300 hospital patients had a smoking-related cancer such as lung cancer – more than one in 10 of all cancer admissions.

A further 135,400 patients were diagnosed with circulatory diseases such as heart disease. More people tried to kick the habit last year, says the HSCIC. Between 2011 and 2012, 816,000 people set a quit date with the help of NHS Stop Smoking Services, up four per cent on the previous year.

Around half were reported as  successful four weeks later, a  similar figure to previous years. Campaigners said the toll of smoking would increase pressure on ministers to follow the lead set by Australia and ban branded packaging of cigarettes. The Government has just concluded its consultation on a proposal for mandatory plain packaging.

Almost nine out of 10 cancer patients rate their NHS care as very good or excellent.

But almost one in five said they were not being treated with respect when told they had cancer – a rate that is unchanged since the survey was first carried out in 2010.

Almost 72,000 people took part last year in the latest National Cancer Patient Experience Survey, which published its results today.

Around 94 per cent of patients said they always have enough privacy when being examined or treated, up from 93 per cent, while 83 per cent said they were seen by a hospital doctor quickly compared with 81 per cent.

While 88 per cent rated their care as very good or excellent, no comparison can be made with the previous poll as the quality of care was not rated in the same way in 2010.

Just 83 per cent said they were ‘sensitively’ told they had cancer.

Nine out of 10 said they were given clear answers from health staff, but barely two-thirds felt their families had been given enough information. 

Some 98 of 158 NHS trusts in England improved their overall scores.

More than 150,000 youngsters aged 11 to 15 start smoking each year in the UK. HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: ‘These figures present in stark terms the impact smoking has on people’s health and NHS services.’

Amanda Sandford, research manager at charity Action on Smoking and Health, said ‘Taken together, the statistics on hospital admissions due to smoking and those seeking help to quit show just how much smokers want to quit, yet how hard it is to do so. Smoking is still by far the biggest single cause of preventable illness and premature death.

‘Helping adults to quit should remain a priority of the NHS but we also need to have measures in place such as a ban on the promotional features on cigarette packs if we are to stop the next generation from being hooked.’

Maureen Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘By introducing plain tobacco packaging and getting rid of glitzy design and branding, we can reduce the appeal of this deadly product to young people.’

However, Simon Clark, director of the smokers’ group Forest, said almost a quarter of a million people had signed its petition against plain packaging, including those with  concerns about counterfeiting and the sale of illicit tobacco.

He said: ‘We support all reasonable attempts to discourage children from smoking, but there is no  evidence to support the claim that plain packaging will prevent children from taking up smoking.

‘Putting cigarettes in standardised packs is tantamount to state- sponsored bullying.

‘It is yet another attempt to  denormalise a legal product and stigmatise those who consume it.'
