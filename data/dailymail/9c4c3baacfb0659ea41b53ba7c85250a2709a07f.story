The body of the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez cannot be embalmed for permanent viewing because it had already begun to decompose by the time the decision to do so was made.

President Chavez died on March 5, but the decision to preserve his body permanently was only announced two days later.  

According to one Columbian embalmer, a body has to
be chemically treated within hours of death to forestall decomposition unless it is kept 
refrigerated at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius).

Many Venezuelans had hoped Chavez's body would be placed on permanent display like those of Vladimir Lenin, Ho Chi Minh and Mao Zedong.

It was to have been put 
on display at a military museum on a hill a mile from the presidential 
palace, where it was to have been transferred on Friday.

But acting president Nicolas Maduro said this is now unlikely to happen.

'The decision should have been made much earlier,' Nicolas Maduro said during a speech at a government-run book fair.

'The decision, or really the proposal more than a decision, was made as a product of love.'

Some of the world's leading embalming experts from Russia and Germany had been brought in and consulted but they had advised authorities that it was probably not possible, said Maduro.  '

Colombian embalmer, Camilo 
Jaramillo said: 'What I really thought was odd, and what raised a lot of questions, is that they were putting him on display in vigil.

Indeed, the body was still on display yesterday at the military academy where it has lain in state for a week.

The idea of placing Chavez on permanent display, las Maduro said when he announced it, was influenced by visiting leaders, said Maduro.

He did not give names but Presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia, Jose Mujica of Uruguay and Cristina Fernandez of Argentina all arrived in Venezuela the day after Chavez died.

Maduro said that regardless of what authorities decided to do with the body 'we will have our comandante open so that our people can accompany him permanently.'

'His place of Christian rest will be a most beautiful place, it is already a most beautiful place," he added.

However Mr Jaramillo, had one theory as to why the government had apparently changed its mind on embalming.

In several videos recorded before his death, Chavez is seen saying he wishes to be buried in Sabaneta, his hometown.

He didn't want to be embalmed,' said Mr Jaramillo. 'Perhaps they took into account some of his wishes.'
