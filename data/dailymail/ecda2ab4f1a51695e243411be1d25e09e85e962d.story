Andy Murray powered through to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon yesterday – but he wasn’t always the centre of attention.

Many spectators found themselves distracted by the sartorial choices of Ilie Nastase and Sir Cliff Richard.

Nastase, the 67-year-old Romanian former world number one, was described as looking like a South American dictator from the 1970s as he arrived in the royal box in a blue military-style jacket and dark glasses.

As dashing as ever: In his heyday, the four-times married tennis star was reported to have slept with more than 1,000 women

During his volatile playing career the
 man nicknamed ‘the Bucharest Buffoon’ was officially a Romanian army 
officer and was employed by the ministry of defence under his country’s 
communist regime.

Communism was overthrown in 1989 and Nastase later said his military rank had been merely honorary.

In
 2008, he was named retired major-general by Romanian presidential 
decree, and he is believed to have been proudly wearing his formal 
uniform at Wimbledon yesterday.

Twice
 a Wimbledon losing finalist in the Seventies, Nastase was known as much
 for his on-court histrionics as his playing ability.

His career was overshadowed by fines, disqualifications and suspensions caused by his frequent temper tantrums.

But he remained well liked off court 
and, with his dashing good looks, the four-times married star was 
reported to have slept with more than 1,000 women.

Since the age of nine, British number two Laura Robson and Canadian player Eugenie Bouchard (pictured above) have toured the world together, becoming firm friends in the process.

And yesterday Miss Bouchard managed to reach Wimbledon’s quarter-finals – but while her career is flourishing, her friendship with 20-year-old Miss Robson appears to have floundered.

Asked on Twitter who her best friend in tennis was yesterday, Miss Robson – who had to miss the tournament because of a wrist injury – made no reference to her former confidante, saying: ‘I am friends with most of the Americans and Australians.’

And at the French Open last month, Miss Bouchard, 20, declared: ‘My best friend on tour? I don’t have one. I don’t think the tour is the place to have friends.’

The player could be modelling herself on her childhood heroine, Maria Sharapova, who likes to distance herself from her rivals.

However Miss Robson seems to be more than happy to socialise with her fellow players, heading to London’s hottest restaurant Chiltern Firehouse with Caroline Wozniacki last Friday.

Also catching the eye yesterday was 
Sir Cliff Richard in a garish striped blue suit and clashing tie, teamed
 with a red rose in his buttonhole and tinted blue sunglasses.

But even more startling was the Wimbledon Championships pass clasped in the 73-year-old singer’s hand.

His ID badge included a passport photograph which appeared to be at least 20 years out of date and showed him with a shorter, cropped hair style and almost completely wrinkle-free.

Sir Cliff signed autographs for tennis fans as he walked through the grounds before taking his seat on Centre Court beside Sir Trevor McDonald.

The pair watched Eugenie Bouchard’s victory over Alize Cornet before staying to watch Andy Murray beat South African Kevin Anderson, 28.

Murray, 27, beat his giant 6ft 8in opponent in three straight sets last night.

The victory by the reigning Wimbledon champion will fuel hopes of a second consecutive title for Murray, as bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning to 5/2.

After the match, Murray admitted it ‘got a bit tense’ on the court because the number 20 seed was ‘playing very well at the end and making it very tough for me’.

But he said the huge support from the crowd had given him a ‘big lift’ and made the game very hard for his opponent.

Murray, who is fifth in the world, was watched on court by his coach Amelie Mauresmo and his mother Judy Murray as well as his girlfriend Kim Sears.

Before the match, Murray’s tennis player brother Jamie suggested we might not have another champion like Murray for a century because of a lack of promotion of tennis in Britain.

He said his brother is ‘not going to be around for ever’, adding: ‘Who knows when the next top British guy is going to be? That could be 50 years, 100 years, no one knows.’

Jamie, who is competing in both the men’s and mixed doubles this year, said successful players in Britain were still a product of luck rather than as a result of receiving the ‘right opportunities’.
