They are completely free of two of the most debilitating illnesses - diabetes and cancer. 

Now scientists hope a community of dwarfs living in a remote corner of Ecuador could hold the key to a cure for both. 

The Laron dwarfs, who have a condition believed to be caused by inbreeding, appear to be completely immune to cancer and other age and lifestyle associated diseases.

People who inherit the genetic defect are in perfect proportion but grow only to an average height of 4ft.

For more than 24 years, endocrinologists Jaime Guevara-Aguirre (top left) and Arlan Rosenbloom (top right) have tracked a population of Ecuadorians dwarves who seem to be immune to cancer

Jaime Guevara-Aguirre (pictured in 2009 with some participants in his research) was the first to identify a population of Ecuadorians with Laron syndrome

Now scientists are developing a drug which they hope will do artificially what the genetic defect in Laron syndrome does naturally -  protect against DNA damage that fuels cancer growth.

There are around 300 people in the world with the condition Laron dwarfism, a third of whom live in remote villages in Ecuador’s southern Loja province.

Sufferers of Laron lack a hormone called Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, or IGF-1.

It is IGF-1, not growth hormone, that stimulates the cell to grow and 
divide to form new cells.

In ordinary humans, too much of the hormone can lead a person
 to develop breast, prostate or bowel cancers at an early age, Discovery Magazine reports.

Studies of the Laron group showed that  while they had high levels of growth hormone, their 
cells were not generating IGF-1.

Dr Jaime Guevara-Aguirre, a hormone expert from the Ecuadorian Institute
 of Endocrinology, and Dr Valter Longo at the University of Southern California have been studying the Laron group for the best part of two decades.

They believe that having less IGF1 could mean suffering less of the DNA 
damage that occurs in all of us when we age and which leads to cancer.

They are also studying whether the Laron dwarfs could hold the key for the prevention of diabetes, as despite a tendency to obesity due to overeating and a poor diet, it is another condition to which they appear immune.

Guevara-Aguirre was inspired to study Laron syndrome after growing up in the Loja province in southern Ecuador, where he often saw short people known locally as pigmeitos - loosely translates as pygmies - living in small towns

He told Discovery Magazine: 'I had seen maybe 20 of them on the streets when I was young.'

Enlisting the help of a family acquaintance Guevara-Aguirre, visited the provinces of southern Ecuador, not too far from where he had spent parts of his childhood, to find more. 

He met with families, asked questions, and took blood samples, discovering more and more cases each week .

By late 1989, they had enough cases— 20 total, 19 of them women—to publish an article on the 'Little Women of Loja' in NEJM, which recognised the growth hormone deficiency in the inbred people.

But it is Dr Longo who has taken the first step into developing anticancer and antiaging drugs with  lessons learned from Laron syndrome.

In 2008 he founded DSR Pharmaceuticals with the aim of developing a pill that blocks the growth hormone receptor.

It is hoped the drug will do artificially what the genetic defect in Laron syndrome does naturally - protect against DNA damage that fuels cancer growth.

A more expensive injection form of the drug was discovered a decade ago.

It has since been approved by the regulatory body the Food and Drug Association to treat individuals with acromegaly, a condition in which there is too much growth hormone in adults, resulting in abnormal growth of body tissues, especially hands, feet, and face.

Now Longo believes that it might also be useful in the treatment of cancer.

In the late 1950s, Israeli 
endocrinologist Zvi Laron began studying patients, some with childhood diabetes and others with growth and sexual
 development disorders.

His earliest patients included three 
young siblings—two boys and a girl— all with severely stunted growth. They were all obese, with thin hair, pronounced foreheads, and a collapsed nasal bridge, and their grandparents were first 
cousins.

Laron assumed they had a severe shortage of growth hormone, but some years later, after new blood tests were developed, it transpired the levels of growth 
hormone were abnormal—they were extremely high.

By the mid-1960s he had identified 20 more such people. He reasoned that either they had
 defective hormones, or something was wrong with the 
cells that respond to those hormones.

Every cell in the body contains 
receptors, which act like tiny locks for hormones, Discover Magazine reports.

When a hormone finds a matching 
lock, it binds to the receptor and triggers the cell to do something, 
such as grow or divide.

But while studying the cells of his subjects, Laron found that normal growth hormone failed to 
bind to its associated receptor, suggesting that they were 
damaged.

In 1984, he published a paper showing that the short stature of
 people with Laron syndrome results from their inability to respond to 
growth hormone, no matter how much they have floating around.
