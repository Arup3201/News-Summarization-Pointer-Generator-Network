£4.8bn move: The Chancellor George Osborne will agree to unlock billions in child trust funds and allow parents to transfer their investments into more generous junior ISAs

The savings of more than six million children are to be rescued and the remaining elderly victims of one of Britain’s biggest financial scandals compensated in a twin Budget boost for young and old.

Chancellor George Osborne will today agree to unlock £4.8billion in child trust funds and allow parents to transfer their investments into more generous Junior ISAs.

His move follows a long-running Money Mail campaign.

The Chancellor will also use his Budget statement to announce that thousands of elderly people who lost up to half their life savings when Equitable Life came close to collapse a decade ago will receive compensation.

Policyholders over the age of 60 who bought annuities from the world’s oldest insurer before September 1 1992, who have previously been excluded from a repayment scheme, will receive up to £10,000 each. The Chancellor’s fourth Budget will be delivered against a grim economic backdrop, with flatlining growth putting his deficit-reduction plans under great strain.

He is expected to scrap a planned 3p fuel duty rise due in the autumn, and increase the threshold for income tax to £10,000, benefiting 24million basic rate taxpayers.

Treasury sources told the Daily Mail that one key move to boost savings will be an announcement that funds will be allowed to be transferred from child trust funds to Junior ISAs.

Many parents and grandparents have contributed thousands of pounds to child trust funds on the back of promises from the last Government that they would prove ideal long-term investments for their child. But Coalition austerity measures meant the £250 being paid to every newborn to start a fund was stopped and the trust funds scrapped, to be replaced by Junior ISAs with no state contribution.

Those with a child trust fund – children born between September 1, 2002, and January 2, 2011 – have not been entitled to open a Junior ISA or transfer their cash to one.

But there have been growing concerns that the £4.8billion in the funds could be condemned to years of poor returns.

Experts have warned that investment firms no longer able to attract new customers have little incentive to put their best managers in charge, while banks and building societies have paid derisory interest rates. Crucially, the rates paid on Junior ISAs are much better, and there are thousands of funds to choose from.

Mr Osborne will announce a 12-week consultation on how to allow transfers of funds from child trust fund accounts into Junior ISAs. These transfers could be voluntary or mandatory.

The Chancellor will also extend compensation for Equitable Life policyholders – the subject of another Daily Mail campaign. Up to a million victims lost out when Equitable Life closed to new business.

The Government was obliged to pay compensation to some policyholders following a series of scathing judgements. Parliamentary ombudsman Ann Abraham concluded there were ten instances of maladministration between 1998 and 2001 at the Department of Trade and Industry, the Government Actuary Department and the Financial Services Authority, which contributed to the firm’s collapse.

Currently, policyholders who bought a with-profits annuity from Equitable Life before September 1, 1992 are not included in a compensation scheme announced in 2010. Campaigners have asked that a specific group of 9,000 elderly policyholders should be included.

Now, those over the age of 60 will get £5,000, with an additional £5,000 for those in receipt of Pension Credit.
