Missing: Kathlyn Shepard of dayton, Iowa is missing and the man police believe abducted her was found dead from suicide Monday

The man suspected of abducting an  Iowa girl has killed himself amidst a massive
search for the 15-year-old who disappeared Monday after getting off her school bus.

Kathlynn Shepard of Dayton, Iowa was still missing Tuesday,
and authorities said a massive search was underway. Meanwhile, the Iowa
Division of Criminal Investigation said Michael Klunder, who is suspected of
taking her and another girl, was found dead from suicide.

Dozens of federal, state and local law enforcement officials
are searching by air, land and water for Kathlynn Shepard. She and a
12-year-old girl, who are friends, were taken Monday afternoon shortly after
stepping off a school bus in the town about 60 miles north of Des Moines.

The younger girl, who was later able to escape, told
authorities the girls had accepted a ride from a stranger.

DCI Special Agent Bill Kietzman said Tuesday that the body
of 42-year-old suspect Michael Klunder was found Monday night with a red Toyota
Tundra pickup at a rural property northeast of Dayton.

Kietzman said authorities have begun focusing their search
for Kathlynn to locations within 20 miles of Dayton, including Klunder's
residence.

Previously, the search covered up to 100 square miles of
mostly rural areas.

Authorities have also coordinated with the FBI to update
electronic billboards around the state with information about the search.

Kietzman would not elaborate on the likelihood of finding
Kathlynn alive, though he remained optimistic.

‘Time obviously is not your friend in these kinds of
situations,’ he said at a news conference. ‘Our plan is that we're going to
find her alive. That's our hope.’

The 12-year-old girl, who has not been identified, told
investigators she and Kathlynn were taken to an agricultural facility. But she
was able to escape a short time later and ran to a rural residence for help,
Kietzman said. She was then taken to a Fort Dodge hospital and released.

Past offender: Police say convicted sex offender Michael Klunder, 42, abducted Shepard and another girl. He was found dead from a suicide Monday

The abduction spanned several hours, officials said, with
Klunder's body being discovered nearly four hours after the girls were taken.

Kathlynn is described as being 5-feet-6-inches and 160
pounds. She has blond hair, blue eyes and braces. She was last seen wearing
jeans, a gray hooded sweatshirt and a Minnesota Vikings baseball cap.

‘The response by volunteers has been outstanding,’ said DCI
Director Charis Paulson.

Jessica Lown with the Iowa Department of Public Safety said
authorities have been in contact with Kathlynn's family and they have declined
to comment.

‘They're continuing to search for the girl under the
assumption that she is still alive because right at this point in time we don't
have information indicating otherwise,’ Lown said. ‘That's the way these things
work for all missing children and missing person cases. We search until we find
them.’

Klunder is listed on the state's sex offender registry,
prison records show. He spent several years in prison after being convicted on
kidnapping and assault charges, including the 1991 abduction and assault of a
Rudd woman and the kidnapping of two toddlers from an apartment complex in
Charles City, according to the Mason City Globe Gazette. The girls, both 3,
were found alive inside a dumpster.

Search: Kathlynn Shepard took a ride from stranger Michael Klunder, who turned out to be a sex offender. Klunder has since killed himself but a massive hunt for Shepard is still underway

He was released from a work release program in February
2011.

The abduction comes less than a year after the high-profile
disappearance of two cousins in Evansdale, about 90 miles east of Dayton. Lyric
Cook, 10, and 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins disappeared while riding their bikes
last July. Hunters found their bodies in a remote, wooded area in December.

Evansdale Police Chief Kent Smock said investigators were
looking into whether Klunder was involved in Lyric and Elizabeth's kidnappings
and deaths. DCI and FBI agents who have been involved in the search for the
Evansdale girls have been dispatched to help search for Kathlynn.

Smock said investigators were trying to determine whether
Klunder had any ties to the area.

‘There's a multitude of things we're looking at to determine
whether he may be a person of interest or not a person of interest,’ he said. ‘It's
much too early in their investigation to be able to say with any degree of
accuracy one way or another whether it's related to our case at all.’

Authorities are asking the public for information about any
interactions with Klunder, as well of any sighting of his pickup between 3 p.m.
and 8 p.m. Monday.
