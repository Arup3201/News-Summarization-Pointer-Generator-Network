A Southwest Airlines jet that crash-landed at LaGuardia Airport touched down on its front nose wheel first before the main landing gear at the rear of the plane.

About 150 people were aboard the Boeing 737, and 16 passengers suffered minor injuries when the Flight 345 from Nashville, Tennessee, 
skidded off the runway Monday and came to rest on its nose.

The nose-down landing violated the airline's normal procedures, Southwest said.

Down and out: The landing gear of a Boeing 737 operated by Southwest Airlines collapsed on landing at La Guardia Airport in New York. The mishap closed both of the airport¿s runways for more than an hour

A Southwest flight crash-landed at New York's La Guardia airport on Monday evening after the landing gear unexpectedly crumpled beneath the plane

Caught on tape: A grainy video of the plane skidding down the runway for 15 seconds was released on Tuesday morning just as the airport fully reopened 

The
National Transportation Safety Board has released preliminary 
information about the accident and said the finding was based on video 
and other evidence.

NTSB
spokesman Eric Weiss would not say whether pilot error contributed to 
the hard landing or if the nose gear should have been able to withstand 
the impact.

'That's something we're going to look at during the investigation,' Weiss said.

Southwest
spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger said the 'landing scenario that the NTSB 
described is not in accordance with our operating procedures.' She 
provided no further details.

About
4 seconds before touchdown, the plane's pitch was about 2 degrees 
nose-up, the NTSB revealed. When the plane touched the runway, it was 
pitched down about 3 degrees, it said.

Emergency vehicles can be seen rushing to the scene of the crash and hosing down the nose of the jack-knifed plane

Pilots
are trained to land on the main landing gear, which are much sturdier 
than the nose wheel, and then gently ease the nose of the plane down 
until the nose wheel is on the runway.

Denny
Kelly, a retired airline pilot and now a consultant and private 
accident investigator in Dallas, said that the Southwest plane was 
pointing nose-down 3 degrees when it touched the runway, 'That's a 
problem.'

'If you are 
pitched down at all, you will land on the nose wheel. At touchdown, the 
nose should be pointed up at 3 to 5 degrees,' Kelly said.

Inflatable ramps were extended from the doors of the plane to allow passengers to escape

The
NTSB had said Wednesday that the landing gear 'collapsed rearward and 
upward into the fuselage, damaging the electronics bay that houses 
avionics.'

It posted a photo showing the jet's electronics bay penetrated by the landing gear with only the right axle still attached.

Investigators recovered the flight data and cockpit voice recorders on Tuesday. They'll be analyzed by the NTSB.
