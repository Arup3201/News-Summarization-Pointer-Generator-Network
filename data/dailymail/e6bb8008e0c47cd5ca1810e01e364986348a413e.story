Organizers of a University of Missouri demonstration held Tuesday in protest of the exoneration of Darren Wilson asked that 'only people of color' participate in their 'die-in.'

The group's email blast about the event asked  'non-people of color to stand holding hands in solidarity' at the Columbia, Missouri campus event.

A class walk-out that preceded the die-in was open to anyone interested in demonstrating. However, some are criticizing the organizers' choice to exclude 'non-people of color.' 

Organizers of a University of Missouri demonstration held Tuesday in protest of the exoneration of Darren Wilson asked that 'only people of color' participate in their 'die-in'

The group's email (pictured) about the event asked 'non-people of color to stand holding hands in solidarity' at the Columbia, Missouri campus event.

The College Fix spoke to one organizer about the decision.

'The "die-in" is meant to represent black bodies that are killed unjustly. It was requested that others stand in a circle holding hands,' explained student Ebony Francis. 

The demonstration lasted four-and-a-half minutes as a nod to the four-and-a-half hours that Michael Brown's body lay on the street after he was shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson.

Demonstrations lasted about an hour and a half total on Tuesday and were meant to protest the grand jury decision not to indict Wilson. 

It was also meant as a demand for an equal justice system. One student told the College Fix that demonstrators failed, at least with that goal.

'If they are trying to make a message that is against racism,' said junior Daniel Beaman, 'I think they may have failed. The email makes it appear as if white people are not victims of police brutality. Like it’s only a black issue.'

Die-ins like this one at Atlanta's Emory University have happened all over America in the wake of grand jury decisions in the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases
