Teachers who survived the Sandy Hook massacre spoke today of the horrifying moment it dawned on them that a shooter was on the loose in the school.

Connie Sullivan, who teaches the third grade, said her children were happily engrossed in a project when she heard gunshots at 9.30am on Friday. She quickly told her students to hide and begged them to stay quiet.

She said: 'I heard a popping sound. Some noises were coming over the loudspeaker, that sounded like weeping.'

Terror: Third-grade teacher Connie Sullivan spoke of her ordeal as she hid students during the Sandy Hook school shooting where 20 students died

The teacher herded her students together and told them they must keep quiet.  Ms Sullivan said: 'I just kept 
reassuring them that they would be okay. That they were loved. That 
their mommies and daddies would be there soon. And that we had them, 
that we would hold them tight.'

She said her students were deeply distraught and crying but were quiet and held each other.

Her colleague Kris Feda also spoke to the Today show about the moment she realized a gunman had burst into the elementary school. 

Ms Feda said that senior members of staff immediately ran into the hallway to face the gunfire.

She said that she had lost sense of time but that the shooting appeared to go on for around ten minutes.

Kindergarten teacher Janet Vollmer said she tried to distract her students, to take their attention away from the terrifying ordeal.

She told the little children that the noises might be someone up on the roof getting a soccer ball. 

After the gunfire finally stopped, 
Ms Vollmer said police arrived and told her to lead students out, 
holding hands and for them to cover their eyes. She added: 'I did pass 
some blood on the floor.'

The
parents at the firehouse 'had relief pouring over them' when they were 
finally reunited with their children, according to Ms Feda.

She
added: 'Kids that weren't picked up yet by parents went in one room and
the parents who were without kids went into another room. That was a 
very difficult scene.'

The teachers said that they would come through this tragedy because they were a strong community who would pull together.

police chief told a news conference today that the teachers and staff 
at Sandy Hook elementary school did 'everything they could'.

School nurse Sally Cox revealed to ABC that she was just 20 feet from the shooter while she hid under her office desk.

She said: 'I could see him from the knees down. 20 feet away. His boots facing my desk. It was seconds. He turned and walked out.'

Once the shooter had left, a secretary who had been hiding nearby, rushed into the nurse's office and two dialed 911. They then hid in the supply closet for the next four hours until police found them.

She added: ' You couldn't hear a whole lot. We heard screaming and the gunshots.'

Police told the women to cover their eyes are they were led from the building.

Four teachers were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School trying to save their students from gunman Adam Lanza.

They have been 
identified as principal Dawn Hochsprung, 47, school psychologist Mary 
Sherlach, 56, Lauren Rousseau, 30, and 27-year-old Vicki Soto. 

Devastated friends of Miss Rousseau 
said she was having 'the best year of her life' after landing her first 
full-time teaching job only months ago. Twenty-eight people died in the 
shooting rampage, including 20 young children.

When Lanza started firing at the 
school in suburban Newtown, Connecticut, Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach
didn't hesitate to confront the crazed shooter.

They ran into the hallway to confront the danger and were murdered execution-style as a result.

First-grade teacher Miss Soto tried to protect her students by hiding them in a closet and telling the gunman that her students were on the other side of the school. She was shot and killed.
