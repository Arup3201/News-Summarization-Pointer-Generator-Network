Rory McIlroy needs Tiger Woods to play in the Masters to help ease the burden of expectation from his shoulders as he chases a career Grand Slam, says Paul McGinley.

Ten years after that chip-in and his fourth - and last - Masters triumph, the world could be denied the latest episode of the Woods soap opera at Augusta National. Even if he declares ready to play next month, the 14-time major champion still appears plagued by demons, seemingly both mental and physical.

But while some might think McIlroy stands to gain the most from not having to battle against the greatest golfer of his generation, there is a distinguished voice suggesting quite the opposite.

Some might think McIlroy could gain from Woods's absence but others, such as McGinley, disagree

The man now being widely hailed as Europe's most astute Ryder Cup captain, when asked whether it will be easier for McIlroy if Woods plays the Masters, said: 'Of course. Look what happened at the US PGA last year, all the talk was "is Tiger going to play, is he not going to play?" Rory was favourite, but all the expectation, all the talk, was focused on Tiger. Rory didn't sneak in the backdoor, but he was able to go about his business without the attention on him.'

Woods, nine months shy of his 40th birthday, will fall outside the world's top 100 when (or if) he gets to Augusta - his worst ranking since before he won his first tournament as a 20-year-old in 1996. McGinley admits he has been 'shocked' at the decline, particularly the horrid chunked chips that have raised questions of the yips.

'The intensity Tiger has given to the game does have an effect,' he said. 'Is there a little bit of burnout going on? There's a reason why guys don't play their best golf in their 40s and late 30s.'

Woods has been plagued by serious back injuries but blamed his chipping issues on swing changes. McGinley thinks there could be more to it, however.

'My hunch would be there's something bigger going on. Rory is in the evolution towards his best golf. There's no doubt Tiger has peaked, in age times, and in terms of when guys normally play their best golf.

'That doesn't mean he's finished, but certainly he's, in Rory wording 'in the back nine of his career'.

McGinley, the victorious Ryder Cup captain, speaks with  the media at Gleneagles in September 2014

'It's not just the wear and tear on your mind and body, having performed at a very high intense level with scrutiny like Tiger's had for 20 years. It's (the) mitigating circumstances - he's got two kids growing up and he's spending more time with them, he's going through a divorce and that causes issues too, and he' s in a new relationship. He's now got some business interests that are going through and designing golf courses that he never did before.

'So Tiger's focus and his evolution as a human being have moved on, and maybe that's one of the reasons why all of a sudden his focus is not here any more.'

But while Woods's star is waning, his successor's is very much on the rise. Victory at Augusta would secure McIlroy's first green jacket - four years after his infamous final-round meltdown - and a seat among the golfing gods. At the age of just 25, McIlroy could join Sarazen, Hogan, Snead, Nicklaus, Player and Woods himself as only the sixth man to win all four majors.

A five-time major champion he may be, but that is a huge amount of pressure on a still fresh-faced kid from Holywood, Northern Ireland. McGinley, however, is keen to point out that McIlroy is blessed with an exceptional maturity.

'It's incredible how much he gets it, how mature he is for such a young guy. But he's had a lot of life experiences. Compared to me, Darren (Clarke) and Padraig (Harrington) when we turned professional, we hadn't travelled the world like Rory had. So he was ahead of the game when he turned pro, and he's just kept on improving. He's evolving and getting better and better.'

Although McIlroy now wears Woods's crown, he is not yet a superstar like the American. The world is waiting to see whether McIlroy can claim his place in history, but it is desperate to answer the burning question: is Tiger really finished?

'I do hope Tiger comes back, we all hope Tiger comes back,' says McGinley, who will be at the Masters commentating for Sky Sports, the only place to watch all four days live. 'I don't know if he will or not, we'll have to wait and see.'
