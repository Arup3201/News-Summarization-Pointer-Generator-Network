Britain's schools are among the worst in the world for social mobility, a study shows.

They were found to have some of the widest achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils in research covering more than 60 countries.

Researchers for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development who compared the reading skills of teenagers with their social backgrounds found that disadvantaged students were twice as likely to be among the poorest performers.

Poor performance: The UK is ranked below average in the international comparison of social mobility, with advantaged pupils scoring around 92 points higher on their 2009 reading tests than disadvantaged teenagers

On average, an advantaged teenager 
scored 88 points more than a disadvantaged one on reading tests, the 
equivalent of more than two years of schooling.

At the top end of the spectrum, 
Shanghai in China, Hong Kong, Finland, South Korea, Canada and Japan 
combined high results and high levels of fairness.

The UK was ranked below average, with
advantaged pupils scoring around 92 points more on their 2009 reading 
tests than disadvantaged teenagers.

In September, the OECD said UK 
schools were among the most socially segregated in the world, with 
children from immigrant backgrounds crammed into disadvantaged schools.

The UK belongs to a group of countries, including Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, France, Hungary, Belgium and the United States, that are successful in terms of above average results, but have lower levels of equity.

Meanwhile, Russia, Spain, Croatia and the Czech Republic are relatively strong on equal opportunities but have low levels of performance.

Bulgaria, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan perform badly in both equity and results.

The report, Are Countries Moving Towards More Equitable Education Systems? says that students from socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged families ‘should be equally likely to succeed in school’.

It says: ‘The fact that school systems vary in the degree to which they allow socio-economic differences to become differences in performance is an indication that any obstacles posed by disadvantaged social background can be overcome.

‘While some of those differences may be attributable to culture, the fact that the relationship has changed significantly in some countries suggests that policy and practice can make a difference.

‘Many countries and economies have made notable progress in narrowing the performance gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students while simultaneously improving overall performance.’

‘We must find new ways for the entire 
education system to work together to narrow these attainment gaps. A 
child’s education achievements must not be determined by their postcode 
or the wealth of their parents' 

- Sophie Livingstone, chief executive of youth and education charity City Year

Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s special adviser on education, told the BBC’s education website that a long-term characteristic of the UK’s education system has been the polarisation between the results of rich and poor pupils.

This is also a major problem for other Western economies, such as France and Germany. However, the big challenge is to develop education systems that do not accept widespread underachievement among poorer pupils.

He said: ‘In the past, economies and school systems could tolerate these inequalities. But the life chances are deteriorating rapidly for those without qualifications. There are more severe penalties.’

Last September, a report from the OECD warned that the UK’s schools were among the most socially segregated in the world.

The vast majority of children from immigrant backgrounds are crammed into disadvantaged schools with high proportions of fellow migrants.

Sophie Livingstone, CEO of City Year, a youth and education charity in London, said yesterday: ‘The latest findings from the OECD on social mobility in UK schools paints an all too familiar picture.

‘We must find new ways for the entire education system to work together to narrow these attainment gaps. A child’s education achievements must not be determined by their postcode or the wealth of their parents.’
