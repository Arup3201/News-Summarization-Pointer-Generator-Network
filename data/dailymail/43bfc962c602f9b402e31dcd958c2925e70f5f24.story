Mouthwatering cuisine has the power of transcending even the fiercest of football rivalries and that was certainly the case in Soho on Thursday night.

Chelsea stars Willian and Ramires and Tottenham's Paulinho joined a star-studded collection of diners at the grand opening of Jinjuu, a restaurant set to become London's premier destination for Korean food.

While matches between Chelsea and Spurs are always keenly-contested on the field, the players were all smiles in agreement as they sampled the latest culinary creations of chef Judy Joo.

Tottenham star Paulinho and his wife Barbara were also at the launch evening for Jinjuu 

Jinjuu - which is the Korean word for 'Pearl' - is located on Kingly Street, close to Carnaby Street and Regent Street in the heart of the capital.

It offers two distinct dining areas - the ground floor menu features 'anju' dishes designed to be eaten as you drink, including Korean fried chicken, savory dumplings and bulgogi style burgers.

Meanwhile downstairs, diners can experience the Korean barbecue food for which Joo is renowned.

The Premier League stars certainly seemed to be enjoying the dishes on offer as they gear up for FA Cup fourth round weekend.

Chelsea host Bradford City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon, while Spurs host Leicester across London at White Hart Lane at the same time.

Also at the launch was West Ham's new signing, the Canadian defender Doneil Henry.

American born Joo made her name working at Gordon Ramsay's restaurants before starting a hugely successful TV career in the States.

Her show 'Korean Food Made Simple' became popular on the US Food Network and has just started screening in the UK.

Joo has also appeared on other TV cookery shows including 'Iron Chef America', 'The Next Iron Chef' and 'Kitchen Inferno'.
