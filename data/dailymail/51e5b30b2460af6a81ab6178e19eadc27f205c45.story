A European flight was delayed for five hours over safety concerns - after a mouse was spotted on-board.

The Swiss aircraft was supposed to depart Zurich for Malaga on Monday at 12.05pm.

But a member of cabin crew saw the rodent at the rear of the Airbus A320 and immediately grounded the plane for safety reasons.

Passengers on board a Swiss air flight were delayed for five hours - because of a mouse

Passengers then had to wait until 5pm for a new plane to arrive to fly them to Spain.

There are always fears that the rogue rodent could have gnawed through any important wires on the aircraft.

The mouse was eventually caught and, after a safety check, the plane was given the all-clear and returned to flight today.

A spokesperson for Swiss said: 'The aircraft was still on the ground in Zurich as a member of the cabin crew saw a mouse in the Eco-Galley in the back of the A320 aircraft.

'For evident safety reasons, Swiss grounded immediately the aircraft and proceeded to an aircraft change.

Cabin crew pointed out that they had seen a mouse, and the plan was grounded

'The passengers could fly later in the afternoon yesterday (Mon) just after 17:00 to Malaga.

'The Swiss maintenance proceeded yesterday to an in-depth check in order to find the mouse, this with success.

'Since this morning (Tuesday), the aircraft is released and back to the operations again. Such a situation happens very rarely at Swiss.'

It is not the first time a plane has been grounded in Switzerland due to a mouse on board.

In 2001, a rodent was spotted as an aircraft came into land after flying from the Dominican Republic.

Then, two-years later, a pair of mice escaped from a container in the hold of a plane on a flight from the American city of Boston.

Last year a plane supposed to travel from Heathrow to New York was grounded shortly before take-off when a mouse was spotted.
