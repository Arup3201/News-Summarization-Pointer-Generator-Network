The carcasses of 11 kangaroos have been found in a bin northeast of Melbourne in the past week, with police concerned by the spate of 'gruesome' killings.

Victoria Police were called to a carwash on Warrandyte-Heidelberg Rd in Warrandyte after a staff member made the shocking discovery on Tuesday afternoon. 

Another six dead kangaroos were found in the same bin last week, along with a 45cm arrow, according to police.

'It's a bit gruesome,' a Victoria Police spokesman said.

'There could be a valid reason why they are there, but we need to find out what is happening.'

George Vattakuzhy made both shocking discoveries, and said it was so 'disgusting' he could not work from his nearby office.

'I empty the bins everyday, so when I opened them I saw the baby kangaroos,' Mr Vattakuzhy said.

'The second time, I found three joeys stuffed into the smaller bins. I went to empty those into the dumpster and found the larger kangaroos.

Victoria Police Sergeant Stewart Henderson said the series of killings is 'quite sickening'. 

'It was absolutely filthy, the smell was very bad.'

Sergeant Stewart Henderson earlier said the deaths may be the work of a bow hunter or bow hunters.

'We are looking at a number in incidents around the area in which animals have been injured or killed by bow hunters,' he said.

'These cases are not only a danger to wildlife but also have the possibility to put the public in danger if hunting is involved.

'To see someone attacking these defenceless animals really is quite sickening.' 

Police are investigating if the spate of deaths is linked to a recent incident where an arrow was found in a live kangaroo in Templestowe.
