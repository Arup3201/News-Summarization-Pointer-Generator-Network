World Cup dream: Headteacher Mark Williams has resigned his job at a Bolton school and has gone to Brazil

A headteacher has quit his job to travel to the World Cup in Brazil because he would not miss 'the trip off a lifetime'.

England and West Ham fan Mark Williams told governors at High Lawn Primary School in Bolton he wanted to resign so he could go to the tournament in South America.

Controversially they have given him two weeks off during term time to travel to Brazil.

He will return in July for the remainder of the summer term before a new headteacher takes over in September.

The decision could infuriate parents who would be punished if they took their children out of school outside holidays.

They can can be fined £60 per child, which increases to £120 if it is not paid within 28 days.

Failure to pay can result in court action and in extreme cases a short prison term.

Mr Williams flew out to South America on Wednesday - the day before hosts Brazil beat Croatia 3-1 in the opening match of the tournament in Sao Paulo.

Mr Williams said: 'I offered my resignation to governors so I could fulfil the trip of a lifetime.

'However, it was agreed with governors that it would be best for the school for me to continue until the end of the year.

'We agreed that I would be on unpaid leave of absence for the two-week period.'

Bosses asked him to stay on at the school but he said he had already made the plans before being asked and confirmed a new head will take over in September.

David Kay, chairman of governors, said: 'Earlier in the year, Mr Williams offered his resignation to the governing body so that he could attend the World Cup in Brazil.

'He also informed us that he wanted to pursue alternative career opportunities.

'Governors agreed that it would be in the best interests of the school to grant unpaid leave of absence for this visit.

'We agreed that Mr Williams to stay on for the remainder of the summer term to ensure a smooth transition into the next academic year.

'It would not have been acceptable for governors to grant unpaid leave of absence without Mr Williams offering his resignation.'

Mr Williams will share his experiences of the World Cup with his pupils when he returns before leaving his role in July.

The teacher has been praised by the school for achieving a 'good with outstanding' Ofsted report on two occasions.
