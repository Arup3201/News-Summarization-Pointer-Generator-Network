Like father, like son. LeBron James Jr, the ten-year-old son of NBA star LeBron James, is already reigning on the basketball court.

The fourth-grader was filmed in action last Friday as he participated in the first day of the 2014 Ronald Searles Holiday Classic tournament in Houston, Texas.

Footage shows the sports prodigy confidently taking charge of the ball and scoring multiple hoops to help his team claim victory.

His proud father took to Twitter this week to congratulate him on his performance.

'Proud of you son! Great job in Houston and congrats on bringing home 1st place,' LeBron Sr. wrote.

LeBron Jr., who plays for Houston's Gulf Coast Blue Chips, is apparently one of the top ranked fourth graders in the country.
