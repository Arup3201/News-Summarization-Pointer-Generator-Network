Missing: Colonel Yuliy Mamchur was driven away by pro-Russian forces following an attack on Belbek Air Force base, near Sevastopol, on Saturday evening

A Ukrainian fighter pilot whose base in Crimea was stormed by pro-Russian forces is still missing - two days after he was taken for a 'meeting' with officers.

Colonel Yuli Mamchur was driven away by the forces following the attack on Belbek Air Force base, near Sevastopol, on Saturday evening.

He was reportedly later released - but has not yet contacted his wife nor colleagues, while his mobile remains switched off.

His wife, Larisa, said yesterday she was 
'worried' about the welfare of her air force commander husband, who has 
become the face of Ukraine' defiance after refusing to succumb to the 
military might of Moscow.

'Of course I am worried; I can’t get in touch with him,' she told The Independent. 'They won’t say where he is.'

Since the attack, the brake cables in the family's Renault Mégane have been cut, 
while a number of death threats have been made, said Mrs Mamchur.

And posters have been put up around the Crimean port calling for Col Mamchur's execution.

When asked if her husband would be able to return safely, Mrs Mamchur said: 'I don't know. We'll see.'

The fighter pilot was last seen as he was being driven away from the military base at Belbek, which is the last major Ukrainian military facility in Crimea to fall into the hands of pro-Russian forces.

In recent weeks, he and his colleagues have become a symbol of defiance in the country.

In action: Col Mamchur, pictured with troops at the Crimea base on the day of the attack, was reportedly later released. However, he has not yet contacted his wife nor colleagues, while his mobile remains switched off

While other bases succumbed to threats 
and intimidation, the regiment - featuring mostly pilots and other 
aviation officers - dared to say 'no' to the opposition forces.

Col Mamcher's defiance is partly to thank for the numerous senior Ukrainian politicans who have called for him to be freed - with some asking for international help in securing his release.

Acting president, Oleksandr 
Turchynov, yesterday called for Col Mamchur's release - adding that the pilot had been deliberately ‘abducted’ by the forces.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian politician, Vitali Klitschko, posted a series of statements saying the colonel was likely being held in the detention facilities of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol.

And thousands of concerned Ukrainians have taken to social media to question the whereabouts and welfare of the pilot.

During the attack on Saturday, Russia sent armoured personnel carriers smashing through the base's walls and fired shots and stun grenades.

One Ukrainian serviceman was reported 
wounded in the clash, which mirrored events at other Ukrainian-held military facilities on the peninsula in recent days. 

It was unclear if the forces, who did not bear 
insignia, were Russian military or local pro-Russia forces.

Crimea
 residents voted last week to secede from Ukraine and join Russia - a 
process that was formalised this week with the blessing of President 
Vladimir Putin.

The vote, 
which was held under condition akin to martial law under the gaze of 
apparently Moscow-led militia forces, has been rejected as illegitimate 
by the international community.

The Ukrainian defence ministry has not provided details of how many bases it still controls on the peninsula.

Meanwhile,
 Russia's deputy defence minister Anatoly Antonov denied on Sunday it 
was massing troops on the Ukrainian border, saying it was observing 
international agreements.

‘The
 Russian defence ministry is observing all the international agreements 
on limiting the numbers of troops in regions bordering Ukraine,’ he told
 journalists, cited by the Interfax news agency.

‘Russia's
 armed forces are not carrying out any unannounced military activity 
that could threaten the security of neighbouring states,’ Mr Antonov 
added.

Ukraine's National 
Security and Defence Council chief Andriy Parubiy warned today that Mr 
Putin was ready to attack Ukraine with ‘troops massed at the border.’

Russian
 Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has discussed Russian troop activities 
on the Ukraine border with US and Ukrainian counterparts Chuck Hagel and
 Igor Tenyukh, Mr Antonov said.

‘Sergei
 Shoigu absolutely clearly and unambiguously informed all those he 
talked to about the real position on the Russian-Ukrainian border and 
the lack of any intentions to concentrate forces there,’ he said.

‘Shoigu
 called on the US defence secretary to objectively assess the state of 
military readiness of the Russian armed forces in the regions bordering 
Ukraine and not to blow up the situation.’

He
 said seven groups of international inspectors visited regions adjoining
 the Ukrainian border over the last month, adding: ‘We have nothing to 
hide there.’

Meanwhile, as Col Mamchur's relatives become increasingly concerned for his whereabouts, the Belbek airbase has become a scene of calm following the violent attack.

Relaxing in the sunshine, a group of Russian soldiers told The Independent 'we have peace now' - adding that they had 'nothing against' the missing pilot.

'We have nothing against him. He kept us waiting for a long time, but he would say he was doing his duty,' said one sergeant.
