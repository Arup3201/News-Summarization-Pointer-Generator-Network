A luxury travel company is offering epic 18-day adventure around Asia where guests will travel by private jet and helicopter, stay in luxury five-star resorts, and get VIP access to off-limits historic landmarks.

Those who are willing to shell out over £36,600 will be jetting off to exotic locations in China, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka in the most luxurious fashion.

'Ultra luxe bespoke' travel company Remote Lands and renowned hotel brand Amanresorts have teamed up to offer the extravagant journey during which guests will fly by private jet between destinations and stay at Amanresorts in Beijing and Hangzhou in China, Thimpu and Paro in Bhutan, Rajasthan and Ranthambore in India, and Galle and Tangalle in Sri Lanka.

18 days of decadence: Luxury travel company Remote Lands has unveiled a jaw-dropping private jet journey across Asia

Taking glamping to new heights: One stop on the tour will be a luxury safari in Ranthambore, India, the first of eight Amanresorts properties

Room for two: The 'tents' on the safari boast a 20-ft canopy, king-size beds and air-conditioning

The trip will take place annually, with the first running from October 3-20 next year.

In the Forbidden City in Beijing, guests will have the opportunity to tour the Inner Court, where the Chong Hue Gong Palace is located. The perfectly preserved structure is normally off-limits to the general public. 

In Bhutan, they will visit Bhutan’s revered Tiger’s Nest monastery, which clings precariously to a cliff face at 2,952ft above ground.

In Ranthambore, guests will stay in luxury tents that give a new meaning to 'glamping'. Each tent is a grand 1,160 square feet, with a soaring 20-ft canopy. Fitted with a king-size bed and soaking tub, they are air-conditioned in summer and heated in winter.

Spectacular sightseeing: In Bhutan, guests will visit the Tiger’s Nest monastery,  2,952 feet above the ground

VIP access: A tour of the inner court of The Forbidden City in Beijing, usually off-limits to the public, is on the itinerary

While there, they will experience guided wildlife safaris through Ranthambore National Park, the former hunting ground of the Maharajah.

The 154 square mile park presents the best opportunities to search for leopards, jungle cats, hyenas and sloth bears, and is the best region in India for spotting the Bengal tiger.

Other tour highlights include touring the Pink City of Jaipur, a walk along the Great Wall of China, and a barbecue with fire dancers on a pristine Sri Lankan beach.

The journey costs $57,750 (approximately £36,700) per person based on double occupancy, with a $23,000 (£14,600) single supplement. 

Chill out time: A luxurious stay at Amanwella resort in Sri Lanka is the final destination on the trip

Grand: After spending days touring the Pink City, a garden suite at Amanbagh in Jaipur will welcome guests

Designer: In Paro, Bhutan, guests will be treated like royalty at Amankora

Splashing out: The journey costs $57,750 per person based on double occupancy, with a $23,000 single supplement

But that hefty bill doesn't buy you a private holiday... guests will travel in a group, with a maximum of 16 guests. 

Remote Lands co-founder and CEO Catherine Heald will lead the trip, and revealed that one of their two eight-person jets had already been filled.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Heald said that the extravagant trip was inspired by 'Amanjunkies' - high net-worth travellers who seek to stay in every one of the 27 Aman properties around the world.

She said: 'Recognizing this, we set out to create the most exclusive private jet journey on offer.

'Our private jet journey across Asia covers 8 Amanresorts over 18 nights and includes extraordinary experiences that would otherwise be impossible such as dining with the retired Bhutanese Ambassador to the United Nations and the USA, visiting areas of Beijing's Forbidden City that are closed to the public, meeting Indian royalty and prominent Sri Lanka artists and intellectuals.'

Flying in style: Two Falcon 2000 executive jets will transport guests between destinations within Asia

High demand: One of the eight-seater jets (similar to the one pictured) has already been booked out for the October 2015 trip

Guests will arrive in Beijing on October 3, staying at Aman at Summer Palace.

After two full days of touring Beijing, including access to off-limits areas of the Forbidden City, guests will travel by private plane to Hangzhou, where they will stay at Amanfayun for two nights.

Next stop is Bhutan, where they will spend four days in Thimpu and Paro.

After that it's back onto the jet for a flight to Jaipur, India to stay at Amanbagh. From there, the group will journey to Ranthambore to stay in luxury tents and enjoy safari at Aman-i-Khas.

And then it's on to Sri Lanka on the Gulfstream - first to Galle and then on to Tangalle, staying at the Amangalla and Amanwella resorts, respectively.

The final destination on the epic journey is Colombo, from which guests can either connect to their flight home, or add an optional extra leg to other Sri Lankan destinations, the Maldives or Dubai - just in case, they didn't quite feel satisfied with their touring.
