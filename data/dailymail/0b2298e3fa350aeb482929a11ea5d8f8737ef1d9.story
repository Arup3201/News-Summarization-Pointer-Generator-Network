Japan's navy today took delivery of its biggest warship
since the Second World War as it continues expanding its military capability in an attempt to shed its post-war pacifism.

Today the Izumo, a helicopter carrier as big as
the Imperial Navy aircraft carriers that battled the United
States in the Pacific, was delivered to the navy in a crowning achievement for the nation's military forces.

With a crew of 470 sailors, it is a highly visible
example of how Japan is expanding the capability of its military
to operate overseas  as Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe seeks lawmaker approval to loosen the restraints of Japan's
pacifist post-war constitution.

Navy and dockyard workers attending the ship's commissioning ceremony today looked on in awe at the massive aircraft carrier

Hundreds of sightseers also visited the dock hoping to catch a glimpse of the huge boat. Here civilians watch as it departs from Yokohama Base, south of Tokyo

Sailors stand at attention on the deck of the warship, while a Japanese naval flag flutters before them. The huge warship is considered symbolic of Japan's growing military capabilities

The 248metre (813ft) long warship resembles U.S. Marine
Corp amphibious assault carriers in size and design but it is
designated as a helicopter destroyer - a label that allows Japan
to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the
means to wage war.

Aircraft carriers, because of their ability
to project force, are considered offensive weapons.

General Nakatani, Japan's Minister of Defence, told media at the handover ceremony in Yokohama: 'The vessel can serve in a wide range of roles including
peace keeping operations, international disaster relief and
aid. It also helps improve our ability to combat submarines.' 

Japan is also adding longer-range patrol aircraft and
military cargo planes to its defence capability, and buying
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, amphibious assault
vehicles and Boeing's Osprey troop carrier, which can
operate from the Izumo.

President Abe's attempts to ease Japan's pacifist constitution and its build up in defence capabilities is unnerving neighbour China. 

The Izumo does not have a catapult necessary to launch
fixed-wing fighters, but a planned vertical-take-off-and-landing
(VTOL) variant of the F-35 could fly from the Izumo's flight
deck.

Based at Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, also the home port
of the U.S. Seventh Fleets carrier battle group, the Izumo will
join two smaller helicopters carriers already in service that
are also classed as destroyers.

However, Japan classes it as a helicopter destroyer, a label that allows it to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the means to wage war

Japan's constitution, known as the Peace Constitution, is most famous for the renunciation of the right to wage war.

It was drawn up under the Allied occupation which followed the Second World War and was intended to replace Japan's previous militaristic and absolute monarchy system with liberal democracy.

Japan was responsible for drawing the U.S. into the war after it launched a surprise attack on the U.S naval base Pearl Harbor in 1941.

The attack was intended as a preventive action to keep the U.S. from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia, which included overseas territories of the UK, Netherlands, and the United States.

The conflict escalated massively when the U.S dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.

This led to the surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945 and brought the hostilities of World War II to a close. Japan's constitution was enacted on May 3, 1947.
