This is the terrifying moment a boiler explodes in a child's playroom, leaving toys and debris scattered all over the place.

Anne-Marie Faiola, 37, from Bellingham, Washington, said her four-year-old son Jamisen had just left the room before the freak accident occurred last Friday afternoon.

Footage caught on a baby monitor camera shows the eruption take place, with a wall suddenly imploding and smoke filling the air.

Fire alarms start sounding as a thick fog fills the room.

Faiola, who owns a soap-making supply company, said she was driving home when she was informed about the explosion by her nanny.

The childminder told her over the phone that she heard a ticking and bang, before seeing smoke coming out of the vents.

Both of Faiola's children, who were not in the room at the time, were evacuated from the house by their nanny and father.

Firefighters then attended the scene to check it was safe to re-inhabit.

Apparently the gas levels inside the home were too high. One fireman told Faiola that if anyone had tried to cook anything, the entire house would have been 'leveled.' 

Commenting on the event, the mother-of-two wrote on her blog: 'Thankfully, instead of blowing up like a rocket ship, the force of the blast took it sideways into our storage area, and not directly up into Lily’s crib - her room is directly above the boiler.

'We’re focusing on that and the feelings of thankfulness, and how lucky we are, rather than the dull monotony of all the next steps. 

'We are safe. Our house can be fixed.' 

Faiola made the video of her gas explosion public to serve as a warning to others to check boilers regularly.

The cause of her home blast is currently under investigation
