Rupert Murdoch was today criticised for describing David Cameron's late son Ivan as 'retarded' during his testimony at the Leveson Inquiry.

The 81-year-old casually used the word, which is now deemed offensive, for the disabled boy as he explained how much admiration he had for the Prime Minister's kindness towards his children.

The media tycoon was telling the hearing about his relationship with David Cameron during the period when the Prime Minister became the opposition leader of the Conservative Party.

'Unfortunate': Rupert Murdoch referred to David Cameron's late son Ivan as 'retarded' during his testimony at the Leveson Inquiry in London today

Mr Murdoch said: 'I first met him once, maybe even twice, at family picnics at weekends at my daughter's house in the grounds of Blenheim Castle (Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire) where he came with his family.

'We were overrun with children, there were no politics.

'But I was extremely impressed at the kindness and feeling he showed to the children, particularly to his retarded son.

'And I came away talking about this - what a good family man.'

Ivan Cameron suffered from severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died in 2009 aged six. He had needed round-the-clock care.

The chief executive of the London Centre For Children With Cerebral Palsy today criticised Mr Murdoch's 'unfortunate' language.

Marc Crank, the organisation's chief 
executive, said: 'It's an unfortunate turn of phrase. Using it is very 
much of a certain age and 81-year-olds do tend to use words that we 
wouldn't use today.

The word 'retard' originated in the late 15th century and comes from the French word 'retarder', which itself derives from the Latin 'retardare' meaning backwards or slow.

After centuries of being used as an official medical adjective to describe a mentally disabled person, it has become increasingly offensive to use the word in recent decades.

By the late 20th century, the word had become slang for describing someone who had done something idiotic or foolish.

But it wasn't until 2006 that the term 'mental retardation' was dropped by the American Association on Mental Retardation and the organisation was renamed American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities

In 2008, a poll by the BBC concluded that 'retard' was the most offensive disability-related word.

'We would hope that people now would be more enlightened that to use such negative terminology.'

Meanwhile
 Mark Gale, campaigns and policy officer for learning disability charity
 Mencap, said: 'From Mencap's point of view, the use of the word is 
completely outdated and it is quite shocking that someone of Rupert 
Murdoch's standing, who is supposed to be close to public views and the 
public opinion, would be so careless in his choice of language.

'Mencap campaigns against the use of this sort of language and really wants a positive representation of disabled people and while high profile figures are continuing to use this sort of language we know that is never going to happen.

'We want people to be aware of how damaging this language is and move beyond the use of that word.'

In a written statement, Mr Murdoch 
said: 'Mr Cameron, since his election as Prime Minister, I have met 
principally in social settings, where little of substance was discussed.

'I
 do recall that, shortly after his election, Mr Cameron invited me in 
for tea at No 10 Downing Street. He thanked me for the support of our 
papers.

'I 
congratulated him and told him that I was sure our titles would watch 
carefully and report whether he kept all of his campaign promises. The 
meeting lasted at most 20 minutes.'

But
 the tycoon denied any involvement in the appointment of former News of 
the World editor Andy Coulson as Mr Cameron's communications chief in 
May 2007.

The Camerons' first child, Ivan was born in 2002 with a rare form of cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy.

Though the couple were initially told by doctors he was suffering a kidney malfunction, Ivan was eventually diagnosed with Ohtahara syndrome - a rare neurological disorder characterised by seizures.

Doctors told the couple that some children with Ohtahara syndrome die in infancy, while others live for years but with profound disability.

Mr Cameron ensured Ivan was christened at the 'earliest opportunity' because of the lack of clarity about his prospects.

Genetic experts told the couple there was a one in 20 chance of future children being born with the condition, though happily Nancy and Arthur are healthy.

The Camerons had to adapt their home in West London to accommodate Ivan, who needed a special lift to get him in and out of his bath.

Though his condition meant he could not move his limbs or speak, the Camerons drew strength from the fact that he appeared to respond to their love and care.

'I was just as surprised as anyone else,' he told the hearing.

Mr Murdoch 
also recalled how an 'unbalanced' Gordon Brown 'declared war' on his 
media empire after switching sides to support the Tories at the last 
election.

But he said claims that Mr Brown had ‘roared at him for 20 minutes’ were a 'colourful exaggeration'.

He went on to recount in detail the conversation he had with the former Prime Minister.

Mr Murdoch recalled how Mr Brown 
asked: ‘Do you know what's going on here?,’ when the front page of the 
Sun was published declaring support for David Cameron in September 2009.

Mr Murdoch said he replied: ‘I was 
not warned of the exact timing, I'm not aware of what they're saying, 
but I'm sorry to tell you Gordon we will support a change of government 
if there is an election.’

He
 then said Mr Brown responded: ‘Well, your company has declared war on 
the government. We have no alternative but to declare war on your 
company.’

He replied: ‘I'm 
sorry to hear that Gordon.’ The call ended. Mr Murdoch said today: 'I 
did not think he was in a very balanced state of mind.'

During today's hearing Mr Murdoch faced repeated questioning
 over whether he sought to influence the politics of Britain through the
 power of his numerous newspapers.

But at each turn, speaking 
deliberately and slowly, he denied ever seeking favours, and at one 
point thumped the table to say: 'In ten years of his power, I never asked Tony Blair for anything, nor indeed did I receive any favours.'

In addition, Mr Murdoch said that he admired, and still does admire Margaret Thatcher - but denied he was 'one of the main powers' behind her leadership and denied consulting with her 
regularly on important policy matters. He again insisted: 'I've never asked a Prime 
minister for anything'.

He also denied ever talking to Mr Cameron about the £8bn BSkyB bid.

Mr Murdoch said it was ‘pure coincidence’ that the BSkyB bid was launched a month after Mr Cameron took power.

The inquiry -
 which also saw one person ejected by police for refusing to sit down - 
 heard that Mr Murdoch visited Downing Street by the back door weeks 
earlier on 10 May 2010 to congratulate Mr Cameron on winning the 
election.
