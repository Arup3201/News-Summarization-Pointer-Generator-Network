A solider and his girlfriend have found a unique way of remaining  connected when he is on tour around the world.

Mark Thompson, 32, takes Mumbles the toy penguin, who was a gift from his girlfriend Meredith Craven, 26, from New York, wherever he goes in the course of his duty as a Major in the British army, snapping him in a variety of unusual and charming situations.

From the cockpit of a Typhoon jet plane to Hadrian's wall in the North of England right across to Kenya; Mumbles, is better travelled than most people, and has even met his real life contemporaries in the Falklands .

Mark, now a Major, joined the army in 2004, following the footsteps of his father, and has travelled the world for many years on tours of duty.

However his work meant being away from his girlfriend Meredith, sometimes for prolonged periods after the couple got together in 2008.

When she gave him a stuffed toy penguin one year named Mumbles, Mark came up with the heart-warming idea to help him and Meredith stay connected.

Meredith says: ‘I purchased Mumbles from Hamleys while on a trip to London and sent him to Mark in the Falklands.

'Mumbles was actually intended to be bait for a killer whale, as Mark had yet to see one, and the season for spotting them was almost over.

‘Instead, Mark started sending photos of Mumbles from various islands within the Falklands.’

Now the humble toy has become a well-established institution within their relationship.

‘Mumbles has been a really sweet way for me to feel connected to Mark as he travels the world!  In particular, some of the lengths he goes to, to snap the photos are pretty romantic.   

‘I believe I have about 50-60 photos of Mumbles in various places: the Falklands, on a Yorkshire castle tour, in Philadelphia, and in Africa,’ Meredith says.
