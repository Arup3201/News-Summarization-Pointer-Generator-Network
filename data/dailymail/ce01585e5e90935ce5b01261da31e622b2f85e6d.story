Australian bat-lovers and conservationists are mourning the loss of an infant flying fox named Charlotte.

Charlotte, also known as Little Miss Charlotte, was in the care of Batzilla the Bat, a bat rescue group in Brisbane, for a little over a month before the baby bat was found to have liver issues and her carers were forced to have her euthanized.

Though the rescue group takes in many orphaned bats, usually rehabilitating them and releasing them back into the wild, Charlotte was different.

Charlotte: Australian bat-lovers and conservationists are mourning the loss of an infant flying fox named Charlotte who was euthanized due to liver issues

Condolences: Here, Denise Wade, a videographer and carer with Batzilla, writes on the group's Facebook page about condolences she has received since Charlotte's passing  

Rescued in January, the flying fox captured the hearts of bat lovers as her carers posted videos and updates of her progress on the group's Facebook page.  

Little Miss Charlotte weighed just under two ounces when carers with Batzilla rescued her after a homeowner found the infant bat lying in a gutter, according to the group's Facebook page. 

Charlotte's parents fell victim to heavy rains in Brisbane that damaged the flying fox population, according to PEOPLE Pets.

'Dehydrated, skinny, and crying for her mum,' Denise Wade, a videographer and carer with Batzilla, wrote, the little bat would have died.

The group shared Charlotte's story on the Facebook page and described her rescue as a 'little miracle,' the post was accompanied by a video of little Charlotte being cradled in the hands of one of the group's carers.

From the very first post, it was clear to see that little Charlotte was special. 

The post of Charlotte's rescue story, along with the video, has since amassed more than 800,000 views, more than 14,000 'likes,' and more than 17,000 shares.

Since the group announced her rescue, Charlotte's little face has graced the group's Facebook page and YouTube account numerous times with videos of Charlotte being massaged, fed, bathed and more.

Her videos and posts on the page have amassed, in total, more than 7 million views, more than 200,000 shares, and more than 200,000 'likes.'

A Facebook post indicates that Charlotte was euthanized in the morning on Feb. 21. In the post Wade wrote that the decision to euthanize little Charlotte was not an easy one and that she cried like a 'big girl.'

'We will never know if her ailment was a result of her prematurity or whether she was just born a little different,' Wade wrote, 'but either way, we had to do the right thing by Charlotte as her long term prognosis was poor.'

The comment section of the post is riddled with condolences from more than 1,000 Facebook users who followed Charlotte's short journey with the rescue group.

Just two days after Wade announced that Charlotte had been euthanized, she returned with another Facebook post expressing gratitude for the outpouring of support she received from bat-lovers via Facebook. 

Wade wrote in part: 'Words cannot express my deep gratitude at the outpouring of love and inspiration at Miss Charlotte's passing. My most heartfelt appreciation to all my Facebook friends for your words of comfort and solace.'
