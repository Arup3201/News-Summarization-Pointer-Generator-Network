Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up is joining an evangelical church - weeks after she ended up in intensive care with 'rotting' legs.

Andressa Urach almost died from botched plastic surgery and feared she would lose her legs after fillers got infected and had to be removed.

The 27-year-old, from Porto Alegre, has since revealed she thinks it was the prayers of her fans that brought her back from the brink of death.

She is now planning on preaching to others about leading a pure life and claims to have already thrown away six wardrobes of clothes, lingerie and bikinis.

The model has also removed any saucy snaps of her rear from her Twitter and Instagram accounts.

She said: 'I believe completely that faith saved my life and it has changed my view about everything.

'It is not what you write or say that makes the difference with God but how you choose to live your life.'

The mother-of-one came second in the popular Miss BumBum competition in 2012.

She revealed she had two types of 'body fillers' - hydrogel and PMMA - injected into her upper legs to lift her bottom.

She also had a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, boob job, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction.

But in July last year the model discovered the fillers were causing her leg muscles to rot, leaving her in excruciating pain.

Miss Urach had an operation to drain 400ml of hydrogel from each leg - but she continued to complain of discomfort.

The presenter spent a month in intensive care and feared she would lose her leg from the damage

In December she was rushed to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg.

She had two unsuccessful drainage procedures and even went into septic shock.

Miss Urach was back in hospital again just weeks after leaving intensive care after waking up in March with further inflammation. Her estimated medical bill is £27,000.

She said at the time: 'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits.

Miss Urach, pictured with her son in hospital (above), said: 'I believe completely that faith saved my life and it has changed my view about everything'

'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.' 

Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world.

Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years.
