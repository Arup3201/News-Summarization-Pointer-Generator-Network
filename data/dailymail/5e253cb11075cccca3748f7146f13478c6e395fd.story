Love them or not, chrysanthemums are among the world's oldest cultivated plants. They've been grown in China for more than 3,000 years and in Japan since around 800 AD.

The flowers might remind you of funerals and their distinctive smell isn't to everyone's liking. But as a plant group, chrysanthemums are so versatile and variable that it would be daft to write off them all off.

Huge exhibition blooms, like comic mother-in-law wedding hats, may not be to your taste. Visit a big autumn flower show, however, or a chrysanthemum society event and you're bound to be impressed — especially by the patience and skill needed to achieve such floral extremes.

Growing competition varieties can be rewarding and it's always thrilling to win a trophy. If you'd like to try, contact the Chrysanthemum Society (nationalchrysanthemumsociety.co.uk) and get to know some of the members. There's also a chrysanthemum column in the weekly magazine Garden News.

You don't have to be an expert to grow them. You could just buy what Americans call 'pot mums'. These are houseplants, raised in their millions in factories and marketed as soon as the flowers open. But that's cheating.

BORDER BEAUTIES

'Pot Mums' — that name makes me cringe — are pretty enough, for non-gardeners. However if you like perennials or long-lasting patio plants, you'll get far more satisfaction from dependable border chrysanthemums. They're easy to grow and the best will provide superb colour from August to Christmas.

Colours range through clean pinks, yellows and white to brooding reds, bronzes and salmon. Flower shapes and sizes vary widely too, from little button blooms to graceful sprays.

What's more, they flower year after year and blend superbly with such other perennials as asters and late salvias. The tall varieties, work best at the back of the border while the more compact, bushy kinds grow beautifully in big patio pots.

RAISE THE STAKES

Border chrysanthemums are good-natured, flourish in full sun in any fertile, free-draining soil.

They hate being overcrowded and taller ones benefit from support. I use interlocking metal stakes coated in dark green plastic, which are barely visible Like most perennials, these plants benefit from rejuvenation treatment. A clump will go on for years, untouched. But dig it up every third spring, split the roots down to small divisions and replant. The plants will flower more freely, grow stronger stems and retain vigour. You can also propagate them from cuttings taken in early spring.

Specialist growers will carry a wider selection. Woottens of Wenhaston (woottensplants.com) stock an impressive range, some available now; others to be propagated for later.

My favourites from their list include the brooding red Ruby Mound, gorgeous single pink Aunt Millicent and purplish pink, button-sized Anastasia. Larger flowered varieties include the tall, old-fashioned white variety Wedding Day.

The best border varieties have a long flowering period. In my garden, Early Yellow opens in August, sometimes with a second burst of later flowers. Last to appear, silvery pink Emperor of China still carries bloom in early December.

A useful trick with early varieties such as the pink Clara Curtis and straw-to-salmon Mary Stoker is to do the 'Chelsea chop'. During Chelsea week — around May 21 — cut all young stems back by a third of their height. This improves their standing power and extends the flowering period.

It also delays flowering, enabling the plants to avoid thrips — a pest that can ruin petals in August, but is usually gone by September.

Who'd have thought such brutal treatment would do a plant so many favours?
