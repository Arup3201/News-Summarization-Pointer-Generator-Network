Manchester United were not in decline when I left... David Moyes was sacked because his team were too slow

I had nothing to do with David Moyes' sacking  

Sir Alex Ferguson reveals he spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their Manchester United futures... but insists he kept 'respectful' distance after he retired

Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed he tried to talk David Moyes into retaining Mike Phelan as Manchester United's assistant manager when he took over at Old Trafford last year.

Moyes brought in his own backroom staff when he took over, with Phelan and first-team coach Rene Meulensteen among those leaving the club after Ferguson's 26-and-a-half year reign came to an end.

Moyes time at Old Trafford lasted less than a year with many critics citing a lack of succession planning from Ferguson as the main reason for his successor's failures.

Ferguson thought it would be a good idea for Phelan to stay at United to provide continuity

Ferguson claims everything was in place at Manchester United to enable Moyes to succeed

But in the new chapters of the latest version of My Autobiography - officially released on Thursday but leaked on Tuesday afternoon, Ferguson insists that everything was in place for Moyes to succeed.

Ferguson says: 'Maybe David felt that at such a massive club he had to be sure that all corners were covered in terms of his support system.

'I felt that network was already there, with plenty of great people already in important slots.'

Moyes instead chose to bring in his own team with Steve Round, Phil Neville, Chris Woods and Jimmy Lumsden joining him in moving from Everton.

Ferguson adds: 'There appears to be an accepted view out there that there was no process. Nonsense. We feel we did everything the right way: quietly, thoroughly, professionally.'

Ferguson believes that the former Everton manager did not appreciate just how big United were as a club and had found it 'a massive jump' from Goodison Park to Old Trafford.

Ferguson adds in the new edition of his autobiography that Moyes went against United's traditions by adopting a more conservative style of playing.

'The reason for playing at speed was that United players had been accustomed to operating that way,' Ferguson writes. 'If the tempo slowed for any reason, I would be into them at half-time.

'"This is not us," I would say. Playing with speed never hindered our results. It was our way: energy and determination in the last third of the pitch.'
