Technology’s attempt to thwart the best efforts of thieves can often fall short.

But a new smart lock could change that by being able to protect against every possible theft attempt on a bicycle.

Berlin-based group LOCK8 claims its device is the world’s first ever alarm protected, trackable, smart bicycle lock.

Safe: A high-tech bike lock has been invented to combat thieves - by sending a message to the owner every time someone tries to tamper with it

Power: Built-in rechargeable LIfePo batteries

Casing: Industrial strength Polycarbonate shell

Connectivity: Bluetooth, GSM, GPRSE

Sensors: Three-axis gyroscope and accelerometer, vibration trigger switch, light sensor, temperature sensor

System capability: Apple iPhone 4S or later with iOS 6 or greater and Android 4.3+ devices with Bluetooth 4 available soon

Alarm: Audible up to 120dB

The triangular device – which is compatible with 95 per cent of bikes - is attached to a normal bike chain and equipped with Bluetooth technology.

It can be locked and unlocked remotely using Android or iOS smartphones and tablets, and has special sensors to detect thieves.

For instance, a smart cable will warn if a thief attempts to use a bolt cutter, an accelerometer can detect drills, while a temperature sensor alerts the owner to blowtorches.

LOCK8 will then send a text message to the owner and sound an ear-splitting alarm to let passers-by know that a theft is taking place.

Given that 91 per cent of today people keep their mobile phone within 3 feet of them, 24 hours a day, the feature means that owners will always know whether their bike is safe.

If the thief does manage to get away with the bike, the device also uses GPS and GSM technology allowing bike owners to find where it has ended up.

Users can swipe the app to or set up the system to automatically unlock when they get within a few feet of the bicycle.

The clever gadget runs on reusable batteries that can be charged through a USB lead.

It was created by Franz Salzmann and Daniel Zajarias-Fainsod, who came up with the idea after their bikes were stolen.

Mr Salzmann, 28, from Berlin, said: 'We were talking about bicycle locks and wondered why there wasn't a smart bike lock, so we decided to invent one.

'When triggered a push notification is sent to your smartphone and a painfully loud alarm is sounded on the bike.

'When it is released it will work with iOS and Android and we are planning that a Windows version will be available in the future.

The Lock8 could also be used by bike-rental agencies as a way to keep track of their fleets and keep them from being stolen.

'We have had requests from cities from all over the world wanting to use LOCK8 as a cornerstone of their bike sharing scheme,' said Mr Salzmann. 

The device costs around £110 and is available for pre-order.
