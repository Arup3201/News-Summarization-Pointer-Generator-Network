Chaos broke out in the streets across Australia this afternoon as police clashed with thousands of students protesting the Abbott goverment's changes to tertiary education funding announced in the recent federal budget.

A massive contingent of police officers struggled to contain the masses as they chanted crude slogans including 'bull****, come off it, our education is not for profit,' reported The Age.

Melbourne saw the most tense conflict, however demonstrations in Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane also exploded in violence and chaos.

The protests caused traffic chaos for commuters around the country, with the Melbourne CBD all but shut down and a northbound lane closed on Sydney's George Street at peak hour.

Just after 5pm, all roads through the city had re-opened. The Transport Management Centre said southbound buses using George Street were delayed up to 15 minutes, and northbound buses on Elizabeth Street were delayed up to 10 minutes.

The demonstrations dominated Sky News coverage shortly after 4pm, with vision beamed out of the Victorian capital of students being carried away by riot police and others stubbornly forming barriers on the city's famous tram tracks.

Tens of thousands of protesters around the country were estimated to have joined in the displays.
