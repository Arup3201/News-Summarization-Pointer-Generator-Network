Airports have been advised to impose tougher restrictions on alcohol sales in the departure lounge after new figures revealed the number of 'disruptive' incidents on flights has tripled over the last three years.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said 114 cases of 'disruptive passengers' were recorded last year, including bomb threats, assaults on cabin crew, smoking in the toilets and trying to gain entry to the cockpit.

The figure for 2014 compared with 85 instances in 2013, 47 in 2012 and 39 in 2011, on British planes.

But despite the sharp rise in recent years, the problem is not as acute as it was in the late 1990s, the CAA said. 

Alcohol has been cited as a factor in the stark increase, with passengers consuming large amounts in departure lounges while waiting to board their flight. 

Of the cases recorded by the aviation watchdog, 34 related to assaults on either cabin crew or passengers, while 18 involved smoking in the plane's toilet.

The CAA revealed that in one incident a passenger had 'attempted to vacate the aircraft' during a flight in August last year. In another flight, which departed London's Heathrow Airport on December 3, a passenger was caught 'interfering with the aircraft heating systems' during take-off.

March 25 on a flight to Palma in Majorca a passenger stood up during the landing and assaulted another passenger.

On a June 16 flight a fight broke out on board, with the crew assaulted and police having to meet the plane on arrival.

A male passenger on a July 17 flight removed all his clothes and tried to open an aircraft door. He refused to don his clothes and was placed in a blanket away from other passengers.

On a December 9 flight a passenger consuming his own alcohol became abusive, attempted to light a cigarette and had to be restrained by four crew members using cuffs and straps. He remained loud, offensive and threatening until the plane landed.

On an April 16 flight about to leave Cancun in Mexico a passenger, who had been drinking, and a companion were ordered off the plane by the captain after becoming abusive and ripping a tray table from the seat. Ground crew had to be used to get the pair off.

On October 19 a passenger pushed her way on board and flatly refused to comply with any of a cabin crew or captain’s instructions and physically assaulted them both. Police escorted her from the plane.

On a January 21 flight two passengers threw hot coffee at each other after engaging in an argument over seating space. The two were separated and treated for burns. Police met the plane.

A February 2 flight involved a passenger physically assaulting a cabin crew member when asked to stop drinking and trying to light a pipe during the descent into land. The passenger was restrained by crew and two passengers with authorities meeting the plane.

One industry insider told The Times that many of the incidents were linked to 'long-haul stag parties', with groups drinking heavily before travelling to destinations such as Las Vegas, Marbella in Spain and Ibiza.

Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association, told the newspaper: 'Airlines set tough rules around the consumption of alcohol and can refuse to carry someone who is drunk to prevent disruptive behaviour and ensure the safety and security of their passengers and crew.

'Pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK and overseas must play their part.'

A CAA spokesman added: 'The number of incidents last year did rise but we have also seen an increase in the number of flights. Cabin crew are getting better trained to deal with incidents and could be reporting more of them.'

'There is no excuse for rude or aggressive conduct by passengers towards cabin crew or fellow passengers on board aircraft. It is actually a specific criminal offence to be drunk on board an aircraft, and also to refuse to comply with instructions from the captain.

'We support UK airlines' efforts to deal with disruptive passengers to ensure the safety of all those on board, and welcome criminal prosecutions where appropriate.'

Last week, a Ryanair flight to Dublin had to be diverted to Denmark after a 'drunk' man stripped semi-naked and allegedly started throwing punches.

The flight was on its way to Ireland from Riga in Latvia February 10 when the man removed his shirt and began flexing his muscles at the plane's rear.

The plane was forced to make the unscheduled landing at Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup, Denmark, and the man was arrested.

Last month, two passengers were also arrested after allegedly fighting while on a holiday jet as it prepared to take off from Glasgow to the Canary Islands.

The men, both aged in their fifties, were arrested on board the Thomson flight bound for Fuerteventura as it prepared to leave Scotland.

The flight was delayed by about one-hour-and-a-half as police boarded the plane to remove the passengers and unload their bags.

A woman claiming to be a teacher was also arrested last month after allegedly becoming drunk and slapping the backsides of cabin crew on an easyJet flight.

The 23-year-old and her partner were said to have become abusive while on the delayed flight from Faro, Portugal, to Southend, Essex, on January 3.

Naomi Campbell, 44

Supermodel Naomi Campbell was banned from flying with British Airways after a violent outburst on a plane.

The 44-year-old was arrested at Heathrow's Terminal 5 in 2008 after clashing with BA staff over a missing bag.

After rowing with cabin staff on the London-Los Angeles flight, she assaulted a police officer who came on board in an attempt to defuse the argument.

Campbell later pleaded guilty to assaulting two police officers and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service and fined £2,300.

According to other passengers the woman repeatedly said she was a schoolteacher while slapping the backsides of cabin crew as they passed, swearing loudly and abusing staff.

The pair were arrested for endangering the lives of fellow passengers after they were removed from the plane, which had been delayed for seven hours by technical problems.

The CAA said the 114 incidents recorded last year were a relatively small amount compared to the two million flights which depart UK airports each year.

And flight crews in the US dealing with an increasing number of 'air rage' incidents have called for bigger fines for unruly passengers.

The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) deals with around 150 air rage incidents complaints every year and over the past 20 years has had to take action against more than 4,000 passengers.

The organisation released a statement saying that repercussions for passengers who engage in unruly behavior can be substantial, but unions disagree about whether the current system of fines actually works.

Although substantial fines are often levied against passengers who become violent or disrupt flights, more often than not fines are settled for far less than the original demand, or left unpaid altogether, an investigation by USA Today and NBC News has revealed.

A drunk passenger who became violent on board a flight in 2012 was fined $15,000 (£9,900) but paid nothing due to 'financial hardship', research showed.

The same year a disruptive passenger fined $5,000 (£3,200) ended up settling with the FAA for $200 (£130)

The report showed that between 2009 and 2013, the FAA fined passengers around £1million, but settled for less than half that amount due to pleas of poor mental health, substance abuse or financial hardship. 

It emerged this week that passengers who misbehave on commercial flights in China could soon find themselves grounded. 

The Civil Aviation Administration of China said it was considering steps to blacklist offending passengers but said no firm decision had been made on the proposed 'no fly list'. 

It also revealed that disruptive passengers could face prosecution if they cause disruption or breach the proposed blacklist restrictions. 

Photos posted on the Weibo social-networking website show a flight attendant covering her face after she was scolded by a passenger throwing hot noodles

China has for some time experienced problems with disruptive passengers, many losing their tempers, with others claiming not to be aware of the rules of air travel. 

A brawl involving three women erupted on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong just before Christmas when two of them complained to a mum that her baby was making too much noise.

The women, all believed to be Chinese, were warned that the pilot would be forced to turn back and make an emergency landing if they didn't stop fighting. 

And only a few days before a female passenger, from China, attacked the flight attendant with a cup of noodles in a violent row that began when she found out that she wouldn't be sitting next to her boyfriend on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China.
