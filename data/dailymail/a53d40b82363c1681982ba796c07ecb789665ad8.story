A New York Fox reporter became a part of the news when his cameraman caught him helping save a commuter who slipped and fell onto rail tracks Tuesday night.

John Huddy was reporting on snowy weather in the New York-metro area for Fox 5 when he saw a man  lose his balance and fall head first onto the tracks at the Metro-North train station in Yonkers.

Huddy and bystander Gregory Legget were the first to run over and each took an arm in an attempt to pull the man up - but struggled to his large size.

Slip: Fox 5 reporter John Huddy (circled) noticed a man fall head first onto train tracks in Yonkers, New York Tuesday night and rushed to pull the man up

Helping hand: Huddy was joined by bystander Gregory Legget and each took an arm of the man

Safe and sound: About three other people eventually joined to helped pull the man back onto the platform

Just made it: The man was safely lifted back onto the platform just in time to catch his train on the other side

'This was not a little guy, by the way, this was a big guy,' Huddy recalled.

But three others quickly joined the recovery effort to get the man off the tracks before the next train arrived.

'A woman actually came up behind me and grabbed me from behind as I'm trying to pull up this guy,' Huddy said.

Eventually the group was successful and the man was pulled back onto the platform just in time to catch his train on the other side.

After their heroic save, Huddy interviewed Mr Legget, the bystander who helped him pull the man up.

'I did all I could do,' Mr Legget said. 'I placed my weight in both hands and I squated and I did all I could do.'

Line of work: This isn't the first time that Huddy has faced danger on the job. In 2011, a protester with the Occupy Wall Street reportedly threatened to stab him when he entered a camp

Snow day: After the incident, Huddy interviewed one of the bystanders that helped him pull the man up and he said he would be staying at home tomorrow because of the weather

When asked if he would take the train to work tomorrow in the expected snow storm, Mr Legget said he was taking the day off.

'No I'm not taking the train. I'm staying home with spaghetti and fried chicken.'

This isn't the first time that Huddy has faced danger on the job.

In 2011, while covering the Occupy Wall Street movement, one protester reportedly threatened to stab him when he entered a camp.
