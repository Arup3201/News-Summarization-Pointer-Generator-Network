A mother told she had just months to live says being diagnosed with cancer has made her a better, more positive person.

Kate Tonner brought her wedding forward after doctors declared the disease was incurable. 

She says the dire warning forced her to embrace life – so she moved house, left her job and started a bucket list of things to do before she died.

Now, two years on, she feels 'more alive than ever' - and credits cancer for her positive outlook.

'I've realised that the most important thing is to grab life full on,' she said. 

'Before I was treading through life. Now I live in the moment - life is way too short.' 

Kate Tonner (pictured right with daughter Grace) brought her wedding forward after doctors warned she didn't have long to live. The now 34-year-old was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer in 2012

Mrs Tonner and her husband Ian, a fire officer, married on December 28, 2012, at a country home in Warwickshire. She said: 'By that stage, the cancer was in my lymph nodes and doctors said "we don't think you should wait"'

Not only that, the 34-year-old believes her diagnosis has led her to have more fun and excitement than many people achieve in a lifetime.

Not only has she sneaked into Buckingham Palace for a garden party, she has met Prince Charles and the Queen, been on a helicopter ride and spent hours having fun with her ten-year-old daughter, Grace. 

The former police officer, from Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire, who was medically retired from her job in 2012, said: 'Weirdly, cancer has made me more positive about life.

'It's encouraged me to embrace life.'

Mrs Tonner was diagnosed with type 2B cervical cancer in March 2012 when she was 30.

It followed a smear test in winter 2011.

'I had been bleeding but had ignored having a smear test because I was too embarrassed,' she said. 

'But I was at the doctors for something else and mentioned that I was bleeding.

'The nurse insisted I had a smear test.'

Mrs Tonner (with husband Ian) had been diagnosed with the disease after a smear test. She had initially delayed having it as she was embarrassed - but a nurse insisted she have one after she mentioned bleeding

Despite undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in September 2012 Mrs Tonner was given the devastating news that the cancer had spread to her pelvis and lymph nodes and was 'incurable'

Just weeks later, in March 2012, Mrs Tonner was referred University Hospital Coventry, where doctors revealed her symptoms were actually those of cancer. 

Despite undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in September that year there was more bad news - the cancer had spread to her pelvis and lymph nodes and was 'incurable'.

As a next step, she needed more radiotherapy.

'Doctors said I had between six and 12 months,' she said. 'They knew my wedding was in April 2013 and told me it was a good idea to move it forward.'

Mrs Tonner and her husband Ian, a fire officer, married on December 28, 2012, at a country home in Warwickshire.

'By that stage the cancer was in my lymph nodes and the doctors had said "we don't think you should wait to get married". 

'I had already picked my dress so it was all okay – I just handed over money and let other people organise it.

'It was a really lovely day although I was really tired.

'But we were aware we didn't have long. They had said 'six to 12 months' in October 2012 so we knew we were living on a deadline.'

And it was this deadline prompted the couple to make changes.

'After the initial shock, we decided we needed to make the best of the time we had,' said Mrs Tonner. 

'We moved house because we were doing up the one we currently lived in - and wanted our free time to be free.' 

After the initial shock of the diagnosis, Mrs Tonner (pictured at Ascot) decided to make the most of the time she had left. She compiled a bucket list and vowed to spend as much time with her family as possible

She and her friends also participated in a 10km race to raise money for a cancer charity

Previously a Police Community Support Officer, she also wanted to spend as much time as she could with her family.

'We wanted our free time to be spent together and with Grace,' she said.

Shortly afterwards, she had the epiphany to write a bucket list before she died - and raise money for charity.

'I did a 10km race with all my friends for a cancer charity,' Mrs Tonner said. 

'We go on holiday as often as we can, we went on a helicopter ride over Warwickshire and we've  been to loads of shows in London.

'We've also had afternoon tea in The Savoy and The Ritz - and every half-term is an adventure.'

One of her highlights was going to Buckingham Palace for a garden party.

She saw the Queen, Prince Charles and Princess Anne.

She continued: 'One of my best friends is in the RAF and was invited to a garden party but unfortunately got shingles and couldn't go so I went. 

'We go on holiday as often as we can, we went on a helicopter ride over Warwickshire and we've been to loads of shows in London,' Mrs Tonner added 

She is now working with the cancer charity Macmillan to promote its latest campaign - to raise awareness of the estimated 550,000 people in the UK who suffer with loneliness as a result of their cancer

'It was a fab day. The Queen was there – but I forgot to take lots of pictures.'

She also visited the home of Gogglebox's posh couple Steph and Dom, who she loves.

She said: 'Being diagnosed with cancer has changed me completely.

'Cancer has changed me for the better – it's made me more positive.

'I don't know what the future holds. Doctors are unsure. They didn't expect me to be here.

'It's watch and wait.'

Mrs Tonner's story features in Macmillan Cancer Support's Isolation Box which will take over London Paddington Station today as part of its Not Alone campaign.

The interactive box, will allow people outside to see in but stop the person inside seeing out.

The aim is to raise awareness of the estimated 550,000 people in the UK who suffer with loneliness as a result of their cancer.
