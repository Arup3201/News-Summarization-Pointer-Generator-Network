Liverpool are having to fight off competition for Alli from England's elite clubs, with Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United all monitoring his situation.

Alli made his debut for MK Dons as a 16-year-old and was a regular for the club last season, making 37 appearances and scoring seven goals, despite his age.

Speaking in March, MK Dons manager Karl Robinson said: 'He is one of the most gifted 17-year-olds this country has ever seen.

'I've said from the word go, he's as good as it gets and he's the best young player I've ever worked with.'
