Since it was revealed Mark Wahlberg is seeking a pardon in Massachusetts for assaults he committed as a teen, the actor is well aware that the court of public opinion has weighed in on why he wants one and whether he deserves it.

'Everyone has an opinion and has a reason why they think I'm doing it,' said the actor Wednesday at the New York premiere of his new movie 'The Gambler,' opening December 25.

'I've been working very hard to correct a lot of mistakes that I made since the day that I woke up and realized, 'You know what? I need to be a leader instead of a follower,'' he said.

However, some Asian Americans are wary of his motivation and wondering why he has never personally apologized. 

Pardon? Mark Wahlberg's application seeking a pardon for a previous assault is being met with skepticism by some Asian Americans, wary of his motivation and wondering why he has never personally apologized

Troubled past: Mark Wahlberg served 45 days in prison after he blinded a man in a 1988 assault

 A group called 18MR, short for 18MillionRising.org, which promotes civic engagement among Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, has voiced its opposition to the pardon. So far almost 3,000 signatured have been collected.

A document was filed November 26 requesting the pardon by Wahlberg. 

It states in 1988, when Wahlberg was 16, he hit a man in the head with a wooden stick while trying to steal two cases of alcohol in front of a convenience store near his family's home in the Dorchester section of Boston.

He punched another man in the face while trying to avoid police.

Court documents reveal just how horrifying the 1988 attack was - including startling racial slurs he shouted at the victim and others.

Wahlberg, who served 45 days in jail after the assault, says his record continues to impact him and could prevent businesses, such as restaurants, that work with him from getting licenses.

Scene of the crime: The liquor store where Wahlberg attacked a man with a stick and then ran away

He insists he has come a long way since April 1988, when he attacked Thanh Lam with a five-foot stick while yelling slurs at him in order to steal the two cases of beer he was carrying. 

Wahlberg admits in the application that he was high on marijuana and narcotics at the time.

He ended up being convicted as an adult of assault and other charges, and he was sentenced to three months in jail. He said he was released after serving about 45 days.

Wahlberg, 43, who went on to be a rapper and then A-list actor who's been nominated for an Oscar, said he isn't trying to use his public persona to sway the decision.

'In no way shape or form was I trying to use my celebrity or success to say, 'Well, I feel entitled to get this because of the fame and fortune.'

Instead he said 'Every day I wake up trying to be the best person I can be.'

He also tries to set an example for kids growing up in tough neighborhoods like he did.

'I've worked really hard to be a positive influence for kids growing up in communities like mine who don't really have a chance, and try to provide an opportunity for them to be more successful and that's why I'm doing it.'

The actor said he's never shied away from talking about his troubled past.

'And it's not like the story hasn't been talked about. I've been talking about it for 25 years. You read any piece that's ever been done on me it's really the same old kind of story and for me to kind of be able to move on from that and move forward and continue to show kids that anything's possible.' 

But it was his appearance in the 1996 film Boogie Nights that really changed things, catapulting Wahlberg into the critically-acclaimed box office juggernaut that he is today.

'I am deeply sorry for the actions that I took on the night of April 8, 1988, as well as for any lasting damage that I may have caused the victims,' Wahlberg wrote in the pardon application. 

'Since that time, I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others.' 

Pardon? It will ultimately be up to newly elected Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker (above) to decide whether or not Wahlberg should be pardoned 

He devotes much of his time and a large amount of his money to various charities, including the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation and the Dorchester Boys and Girls Club.

He is also a family man now, married to former model Rhea Durham and the father of four children, and attends church daily. 

The Board of Pardons will investigate the petition to decide if it warrants a hearing before it is recommended to the governor who by that time will be the recently elected Charlie Baker.

The Massachusetts Parole Board would have to review Wahlberg's case and make a recommendation to the governor, who can grant pardons.

Pardons rarely are issued in Massachusetts. Governor Deval Patrick has not approved one in his nearly two terms in office. Nor did former Governor Mitt Romney.

Wahlberg said his commitment to being a good person and role model stands, no matter the outcome.

'I will continue to do that whether the pardon is granted or not,' he said.
