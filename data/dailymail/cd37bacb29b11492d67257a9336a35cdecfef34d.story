Nigella Lawson has finally broken her silence two months after she was pictured being throttled by husband Charles Saatchi.

The TV chef took to Twitter last night to share a photograph of a cake she'd made to mark the return of The Great British Bake Off.

She made no reference to the high-profile dispute, nor to her impending divorce from her art-collecting billionaire husband.

Since the pictures of Mr Saatchi with his hand on Ms Lawson's neck were published by a Sunday newspaper in June this year, the chef has made no public comment.

By contrast, the advertising mogul has repeatedly spoken out over the controversy - including an announcement that he was divorcing his wife of 10 years.

Ms Lawson returned to her micro-blogging account yesterday, writing: 'Yum: settling down to The Great British Bake Off with a slice of this blackcurrant Victoria sponge #GBBO'.

When one of her 430,000 followers asked whether she had baked the cake herself or bought it in a shop, she replied: 'I MADE IT - though it wouldn't get me far in the #GBBO!'

Ms Lawson then retweeted a quirky message from the official account of BBC quiz show QI.

The tweet read: 'Elizabethan ladies kept apple slices under their armpits to absorb sweat, before passing them to potential suitors as keepsakes.'

The chef had previously tweeted just once since the scandal broke, sharing a photograph of her son Bruno's birthday cake without any accompanying comment.

The Great British Bake Off, whose fourth series began last night on BBC2, has become embroiled in its own love split row after co-presenter Paul Hollywood left his wife for colleague Marcella Valladolid.

Ms Lawson has repeatedly been pictured in public as she has moved her belongings out of the home she shared with Mr Saatchi, but has refused to comment on her divorce.

Mr Saatchi - who has frequently returned to Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, the scene of the argument with his wife - initially tried to dismiss the fight as nothing more than a 'playful tiff'.

He drew increasing ire from campaigners who accused him of trivialising domestic violence as he continued to defend himself.

Last month, he announced in the Mail on Sunday that he was set to divorce Ms Lawson - although court papers suggested that it was she who filed the divorce claim.

The couple were granted a decree nisi three weeks ago, nearly a decade after they married in September 2003 following the death of Ms Lawson's first husband John Diamond.

Since the divorce, Mr Saatchi's teenage daughter has complained that Ms Lawson had effectively abandoned her, while friends of the art collector suggested that he was nursing suicidal thoughts.
