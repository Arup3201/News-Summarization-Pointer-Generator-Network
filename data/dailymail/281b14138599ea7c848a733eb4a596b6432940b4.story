Broad appeal: Mrs Mat, who has allies across the Tory party, is being touted as a possible leader

Theresa May has decided to run for the Tory leadership when David Cameron quits, with allies touting her as Britain’s answer to Angela Merkel.

Backers of the Home Secretary, including some of the most senior women in the Conservative Party, have begun quietly gathering support for her candidacy.

They argue she is the best Cabinet candidate to take on Boris Johnson and unite the party.

Friends say Mrs May is attending ‘a lot’ of constituency dinners where she can curry favour with both MPs and the grassroots.

‘She has decided that she rather wants the job,’ said one supporter. ‘Theresa is tough as nails. She has quietly got on with a job that is usually a political graveyard.

‘She’s not showy but she has good judgment. She’s not the new Maggie, she’s more like Angela Merkel.’

Details of the planning emerged as David Cameron was bounced into guaranteeing George Osborne’s job as Chancellor. The Mail revealed yesterday that some Tory MPs are plotting to force him out.

Rebels plotting a coup that would supposedly have seen backbencher Adam Afriyie replace Mr Cameron have now turned their guns on the Chancellor and will demand his head later this year if the UK slips into a triple-dip recession.

But a senior government source, on Mr Cameron’s trip to Liberia, said the PM had privately guaranteed Mr Osborne his job until the next election.

‘George Osborne will be Chancellor at the next election,’ the source said. ‘He’s an extremely successful Chancellor battling very difficult economic circumstances.

‘He has the Prime Minister’s full confidence. I can’t think of a single Conservative who has raised doubts about George with the Prime Minister.’

Allies of Mrs May believe that, with Mr Osborne under fire, she has a good chance of emerging as the best choice to replace Mr Cameron when he eventually quits. ‘George will only run if he thinks he can win,’ said one Tory. ‘Right now it doesn’t look like he can.’

Mrs May is also winning the support of those seeking an ‘Anyone But Boris’ candidate as successor to the Prime Minister. One minister said: ‘The public might like Boris but they don’t know him. A lot of us worked really hard to get him re-elected as Mayor and then he repays us by undermining the Prime Minister on the economy and Europe. He’s a treacherous b******’.

He added: ‘The question is who can stop him and that’s why Theresa’s name is coming up.’

Mrs May sparked speculation about her future when she gave a highly personal interview about her sadness at not having children.

Support grew among MPs as she pushed through reforms of the police despite vilification by senior officers.

Backing: David Cameron has been forced to issue a guarantee that George Osborne's job as Chancellor

She pleased right-wingers by taking a tough line on opting out of European home affairs directives and standing up to the US by refusing to deport computer hacker Gary McKinnon.

Her longstanding view that the party needs to modernise has endeared her to many on the left.

Senior female MPs, including ousted Cabinet Ministers Cheryl Gillan and Caroline Spelman are quietly letting it be known that they will support her.

Those who have seen her in Cabinet say she stands her ground with the Prime Minister and Chancellor. One Cabinet minister said: ‘She doesn’t take any s*** from David and George. She defends her corner like a tiger.’

Mrs May’s position has been strengthened by Michael Gove’s emphatic claims that he will not run. A senior government source insisted speculation about Mr Cameron’s future was having no impact on him. He said: ‘He feels he had got very strong support from colleagues in Parliament.’
