The season hasn't even started yet and the world is already talking about the latest Barcelona and Real Madrid spat.

But this time the Catalan club weren't even involved - in fact, the bad feelings came about in a pre-season match involving Real and a former Barca star.

Roma's Seydou Keita refused to shake Portugal defender Pepe's hand and threw a water bottle at him - all before the kick-off of a friendly!

Flashpoint: Seydou Keita (second left) withdraws his hand from Pepe's reach (fourth left) as he walks down the line of Real Madrid players

Chill: A team-mate tries to calm the Mali midfielder down but judging by his behaviour later it didn't work...

Impact: Keita's team-mates try to pull him away (bottom centre) after Madrid players take issue with his actions, but he goes a step further

Ouch: Keita's thrown bottle skims off the side of Pepe's head (top right), spraying him with water

Taunt: Pepe (second right) smirks back at Keita (bottom) after that bottle falls to the floor behind him

It was also claimed that Pepe had spat at Keita at some point during proceedings but that does not seem to have been caught on camera.

The came about ahead of the Roma's 1-0 win over the European champions on Wednesday morning in the Guinness International Champions Cup in Dallas.

Pepe and Keita have had their battles down the years in El Clasico games and those ill feelings seemed to come to a head.

The pair have history: Keita accused Pepe of calling him a monkey during a Supercopa Clasico clash in 2011.

History: Keita and Pepe aren't the best of friends - with the former once accusing the latter of racism

This time, after the Mali man refused to shake his opponent's hand in the pre-match pleasantries the pair had to be separated by team mates, with Iker Casillas and Xabi Alonso acting as chief peace-makers.

But that wasn't all - the 34-year-old midfielder then decided it was a wise idea to throw a bottle of water at the notorious Real hard man's head.

Fortunately the usually hot-headed Pepe appeared to laugh it off - but the fourth official claimed he had spat at his counterpart at some point during the scuffle, although it was bizarrely not deemed worthy of a red card.

Angry: Keita still seems to be wound up as he takes issue with Real's Isco after the incident

It's only a friendly! Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso take issue with the former Barcelona player's behaviour

Victory: Roma veteran Francesco Totti later scored the only goal as the Italians ran out narrow winners

In February 2012, Luis Suarez refused to shake the hand of Manchester United defender Patrice Evra after being found guilty by the FA and banned for eight matches for racially abusing the Frenchman the previous October.

Evra offered his hand but the Uruguay star, then of Liverpool, ignored it (below) and moved on down the line of United players. This sparked off even more controversy and prompted Sir Alex Ferguson to call Suarez 'a disgrace'.

A month earlier, in January 2012, the Premier League took the unprecedented step of cancelling the pre-match handshakes between Chelsea and QPR in the wake of the John Terry-Anton Ferdinand affair. Terry had been banned for four matches and fined for racially abusing Ferdinand the previous November and the PL decided to dispense with the handshakes to avoid embarrassment.

That was not the first time Terry had been involved in a handshake gate. His former friend and team-mate Wayne Bridge refused the Chelsea captain's hand on live TV in 2010 (below) over Terry's affair with Bridge's ex-girlfriend.

And it is not just confined to these shores. Last season, in Serie A, Sampdoria striker Maxi Lopez refused Mauro Icardi's handshake after the Inter forward started dating Lopez's ex-wife, and moved in with her.
