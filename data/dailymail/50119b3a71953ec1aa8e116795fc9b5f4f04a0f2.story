We are not quite halfway through Wimbledon — thanks to your quaint Sunday off — and although they have had their setbacks, the men’s Big Four are sitting pretty.

Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic will be happy as they are not affected by the delay caused by Saturday’s weather, which sees Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer facing four matches in six days.

I am still fairly confident that two of my pre-tournament favourites, Murray and Maria Sharapova, are in good shape to emerge as champions.

My guy: Andy Murray looks in good shape to emerge as champion for the second time at Wimbledon

Practice: Murray has been in great shape, hasn't slipped and looks set to go all the way at SW19

My other choice: As does Maria Sharapova, practicing on the Sunday off of Wimbledon

Andy, my one-time pupil, impressed me in week one and although he takes a step up today against Kevin Anderson I am sure he can handle it.

The South African goes big on both first and second serves but Andy’s returns have been coming right out of the middle of his racket.

Amelie Mauresmo seems to be doing a good job as his coach and I am sure she will agree that a key aspect is to keep Anderson moving and off balance because he is a lethal power hitter if allowed.

He does not like long rallies and will try to hit winners from all over.

My hunch is that there will be at least one close set, possibly two, but that Murray will prevail.

My impression is that Djokovic is moving better than last year and that is crucial to his chances.

Four matches in six days is a challenge for Federer but I have liked what I have seen so far and his serve has been outstanding. 

I expected Nadal to have a tough first week but the the court should turn more in his favour as the week goes on.

Big hit: Four matches in six days is a challenge for Roger Federer but he's looked impressive so far

Preparation: Rafael Nadal has had a tough week but still remains on top and it should turn in his favour

The serious danger comes from Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic. Dimitrov’s game is made for grass and I have always had him pencilled in for a possible quarter-final against Murray.

Raonic has been the most improved player on grass I have seen this year. As for that serve — you could spend a week playing him and not manage to break. Nobody has done it so far.

Serena Williams’ defeat by 24th seed Alize Cornet was a real shock and the fact that the top two women’s seeds have gone out of the first week in the past two Slams suggests a changing of the guard.

Former champion Chris Evert told me that when you get into your 30s there are days when your body just feels a bit flat. Well, Serena is 33 in September — and she is human, too.

Now Sharapova should benefit.

It would also be a great story if Caroline Wozniacki was to come through. I don’t like the way she is constantly asked about her private life so it would be a great response.

Bonus: It would be a good story if Caroline Wozniacki was to come through in a rousing response
