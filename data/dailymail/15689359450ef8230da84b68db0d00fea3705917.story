The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to end the scandal of bogus whiplash claims ended in victory last week, as the Government announced a tough crackdown on motorists who fake or exaggerate their injuries.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced that independent medical panels would soon assess the validity of cases – and that it would become easier for insurers to challenge claims in court.

The reforms follow a series of Mail on Sunday reports exposing the activities of Britain’s 5,300 claims management companies, showing how they refer car-crash victims to no-win, no-fee law firms in exchange for cash.

We also revealed that more than 700 such firms been shut down by the Government for malpractice.

There has been a 60 per cent rise in personal injury claims related to road accidents since 2006, despite a 20 per cent reduction in reported collisions.

Experts estimate that there are 1,500 whiplash claims every day, costing £2 billion a year and adding about £90 to every  motor insurance policy.

Mr Grayling said honest drivers had been paying for a system open to abuse by fraudsters.

‘We are proposing action to support effective whiplash diagnosis by medical experts and to simplify procedures that will help to bring speculative  or fraudulent claims before  a judge,’ he said.

The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers criticised the proposals, saying they would ‘cripple access to justice for vulnerable people’.

But a spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: ‘For too long, whiplash has been seen as the “fraud  of choice”.

‘More effective diagnosis of whiplash will help genuine claimants get paid out quickly  and reduce the scope for fraud, so helping to ensure that honest motorists do not end up footing the bill for the cheats.’

There will now be a three-month public consultation on the proposals, which are among a series of measures aimed at cutting legal costs and halting the growth of compensation claims in England and Wales.

Ministers said the industry had promised savings arising from the whiplash reforms would be passed on to motorists.

Premiums could fall by up to £50 a year if the clampdown is successful.
