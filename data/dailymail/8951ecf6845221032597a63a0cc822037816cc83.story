Manchester City have admitted that they misled their supporters and those of feeder club New York City FC over Frank Lampard's contract last summer.

The Barclays Premier League champions have alienated thousands of the fans they were trying to woo in America by keeping Lampard in England rather than sending him to New York for the start of the MLS season in March.

Now senior sources at City have revealed that they made 'mistakes' when initially announcing the terms of Lampard's arrangement at New York last summer.

Initially the NYFC website announced last July that Lampard had signed a two-year deal to take effect from August 1, 2014 while City's own website declared that the former Chelsea midfielder would join them 'on loan' until December 31.

That was repeated in a tweet sent from City's official account on August 6.

Subsequently, however, that has proved not to be the case with City now revealing that Lampard never became a NYCFC player last summer and actually signed a short-term contract at the Premier League club instead. Subsequently, there was no need for a loan.

It is understood that Lampard only signed the equivalent of a pre-contract agreement with NYCFC. The agreement was for him to join on January 1 but that has now been put back to July.

A series of points released to the media on Friday by City are summarised as follows:

* The statement on the NYCFC website in July saying Lampard's two-year contract took effect from Aug 1, 2014 was a mistake.

* The Initial statement on the Manchester City website that it was a loan was also an error.

*.There was never a break clause in Lampard's contract dated 31 December. The short-term contract with City only ran to Dec 31 and has now been extended.

* There was a 'head of terms commitment' from Lampard to join NYCFC from Jan 1, 2015. That was extended to the end of this season.

* Any contract with NYCFC will now take effect from July 1, 2015.

The saga is hugely embarrassing for City, who pride themselves on being a club that does things the right way.

Equally, the situation was not helped by a peculiar statement released by Lampard himself. In attempting to clarify matters, Lampard's declaration only served to point out that he had never signed for NYCFC as initially claimed.

The 36-year-old said: 'I want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days.

'When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play for NYCFC for two years starting January 1, 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York.

'This period has since been extended by Man City and I will now start playing for NYCFC at the end of this current Premier League season.

'There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone. I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible.

'Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015!'
