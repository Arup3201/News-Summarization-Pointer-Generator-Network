A man on trial for strangling to death a schoolteacher is arguing that his wife was really the mastermind of the murder. 

Allen Prue, 32, and his 35-year-old wife Patricia are being tried separately in the 2012 death of teacher and single mother Melissa Jenkins, 33.

Jenkins' body was found dumped in Vermont's Connecticut River in March of that year, after being lured from her home to help the couple who called to say their car broke down.

Allen's trial started this week, while his wife is due in court for her trial sometime next month.

Not my fault: Allen Prue is currently on trial for murdering schoolteacher Melissa Jenkins in March 2012. His trial started yesterday in Vermont, and his defense attorneys plan to argue that his wife Patricia is the real person behind the crime. Allen pictured above in court on Wednesday

Jealous: Allen's defense attorneys claim Patricia Prue (pictured left in March 2012) grew jealous of Melissa Jenkins (right) after her husband asked the teacher out on a date. Jenkins rebuffed Allen's advances and told friends she felt uncomfortable around him

In opening statements on Wednesday, Allen's attorneys argued that the feeble-minded man with a 75 IQ had no idea his wife planned to murder the woman, who he once helped perform snow plow work for. 

After Jenkins' body was found, Allen confessed to police that he and his wife planned 'to get a girl they could play with' which led them to the teacher. 

But his attorneys are now saying Allen admitted to the crime just to protect his wife, who had become crazy after her husband asked Jenkins out on a date. Jenkins had turned down Allen's advances and told friends she felt uncomfortable around him.

Orphaned: Jenkins' was reported missing when a friend found her car abandoned on the side of a road, with her 2-year-old son alone inside. The boy later told authorities: 'someone pulled on mommy's neck'

'In her crazy, twisted mind she had become obsessively jealous of Melissa Jenkins. The evidence will show that Patricia Prue strangled Melissa Jenkins without telling him she was going to do it, without planning it with him and without Allen Prue aware in any way shape or form,' his defense attorney Robert Katims said. 

Jenkins was reported missing in March 2012, after a friend found her car abandoned on the side of the road with her 2-year-old son alone in the back seat. 

The boy later told officers that 'someone pulled on mommy's neck'. 

Weak minded: Allen's attorneys say he has a 75 IQ and was easily manipulated by his wife in the murder. They claim he had no idea she had plans to actually kill Jenkins. Pictured above in court on Wednesday

Authorities say Patricia called Jenkins to come and help her and her husband, saying their car broke down. 

Jenkins agreed, but as soon as she showed up and got out of her vehicle, she was allegedly strangled and beaten to death. 

The couple then took Jenkins' body back to their home where they removed all of her clothes, poured bleach on the body and wrapped her in a tarp.

They dumped the body in the Connecticut River, which separates Vermont from New Hampshire, weighing the body down with blocks, and burning the clothes and tarp. 

Up next: Patricia Prue's trial is set to start next month. She has pleaded not guilty, and her attorneys plan to argue the insanity defense 

Allen reported an hour late to his job delivering papers that night. 

When news broke that he was involved in the murder, his mother said that he had never been in trouble before and doubted that he committed the crime.

Patricia Prue's trial is set to star next month. She has pleaded not guilty and her legal team plan to use the insanity defense. 

If they are convicted, Allen and Patricia Prue could spend the rest of their lives in prison.
