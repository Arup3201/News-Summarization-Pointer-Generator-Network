The daughter of a Nevada lawmaker murdered in 2006 has been found dead after allegedly shooting and killing her lesbian partner and then herself in a shocking murder suicide.

Dallas Augustine, 32, is suspected of murdering Jessie McCaskill, 50, at their Phoenix home before taking her own life.

Police discovered the bodies of the women on Monday evening after a family member, concerned for their welfare, called 911.

Officers arrived at the property around 
8.30pm and found evidence the couple had been fighting. One of the women
had packed her bags and was preparing to leave, investigators said.

The murder weapon, a handgun, was found at the crime scene. The women will undergo autopsies on Friday.

A neighbour told AZcentral.com that Augustine and McCaskill, who had been in a relationship for eight years, fought like cats and dogs.

Phillip Allen, who lived next-door to the couple, told the news website he heard Augustine and McCaskill arguing loudly up to four times a month.

'They fought pretty hard and screamed at each other,' the 65-year-old said. 'Sometimes you'll be inside your house and you can hear them, hear something break once in a while.'

Allen, who knew the women for around two years, said he heard the couple 'yelling and screaming at each other' last Wednesday or Thursday.

Fighting: According to police, friends and family said the pair's relationship was strained and they argued regularly

He added that the women's two dogs barked incessantly over the weekend, which was unusual.

Allen didn't know what the two women would fight about but never remembered seeing physical harm of either of them, according to AZcentral.com.

Sgt. Trent Crump said interviews with friends and family also revealed there had been 'problems in their relationship.'

Allen said the women were packing up the house because the lease was up and that both were moving out to be closer to their jobs.

Augustine worked for the Arizona Department of Corrections in Florence, Southeast of Phoenix.

Her mother, Kathy Augustine, a Nevada state controller, was murdered in her Reno home in 2006.

Condolences: As news of the murder-suicide spread, friends and family posted condolences on the couple's Facebook sites

Her husband, critical care nurse Chaz
Higgs, is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2007 of 
killing the woman by injecting her with a paralytic drug he smuggled 
from his hospital's emergency room.

Dallas Augustine, who reportedly had a
rocky relationship with her mother, attempted to follow in her 
legislative footsteps in 2008. She ran an unsuccessful GOP campaign for 
the same state Assembly seat Kathy once held in Las Vegas.

On her Facebook page, McCaskill posted that she had found the one in Augustine, whom she made a lifetime commitment to in 2007.

'Well, it all worked out in the end,' she wrote.

The woman is shown in photographs from their September, 2007, wedding wearing a white dress and Augustine embraces her with cropped hair and wearing a tuxedo.

As news of the murder-suicide spread, friends and family posted condolences on the social networking site.

'I will miss you both so much, thank you for being in my life!' Linda T Nowalany said.

Another loved one, Tod Serfass, said: 'I will miss you both dearly I hope you rest in peace love you always.'

Augustine had a strained relationship with her family, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

'Dallas took off and did her own thing,' her uncle Phil Alfano said after receiving the news on Tuesday. 'We haven't had any contact with her and really don't know what she's been doing.'

Alfano said Augustine had problems but never asked the family for help.

'I believe there's been some substance abuse, and I think probably some mental health issues,' he told the newspaper. 'Basically she cut off contact with our family. By her choice.'
