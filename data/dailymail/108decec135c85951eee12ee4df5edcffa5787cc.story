Angela Merkel has admitted that Greece should never have been allowed to join the euro back in 2001, stating that is when the financial troubles began leading to the eurozone's current economic strife.

The German chancellor blamed her predecessor Gerhard Schroder for the 'wrong decision'.

She made the speech during an election rally in front of 1,000 supporters yesterday in the northern German town of Rendsburg.

Blame: Angela Merkel has admitted that Greece should never have been allowed to join the euro back in 2001, stating that is when the financial woes began that led to the eurozone's current economic strife

She said the debt crisis that emerged in Greece in late 2009 and dominated her second term had been 'brewing for many years,' reported Bloomberg.

'For example, Greece shouldn’t have been allowed into the euro' she said referring to the 2001 admission.

'Chancellor Schroeder accepted Greece in and weakened the Stability Pact and both decisions were fundamentally wrong, and one of the starting points for our current troubles.'

The current issue of pouring more money into 
stricken Greece comes at a difficult time for 
Merkel, who faces an election next month in which she is tipped to win a
third term in power.

A survey is warning that some 40,000 small businesses in Greece are likely to close in the second half of 2013 at a cost of up to 90,000 jobs despite a major bank rescue program implemented before the summer.

However, the small business survey conducted between July 10 and 16 and published Tuesday found that the 50 billion euro ($66.7 billion) bank recapitalization was likely to result in a modest decline in the rate of closures, from an estimated 55,000 in the first half of the year.

Needs bail: Finance minister Yannis Stournaras wants another £8.6bn for Greece

Greece's conservative-led coalition government has promised to lead the cash-strapped country out of recession and return to bond markets next year.

The bank rescue program was part of the country's second international bailout and considered central to returning Greece to financial health.

Earlier this week Greece said it wants another £8.6billion bailout to stay afloat – but said  it will not accept any more  austerity measures.

Finance minister Yannis Stournaras said the country requires more help on top of the  £206billion it has already received in two rescue packages.

There are now widespread fears that even this vast sum is not enough to plug the hole in its finances and that a third tranche of financial help is a virtual certainty, though it is expected to be on a much smaller scale.

‘If there is need for further support for Greece it will be around 10 billion euros (£8.6bn), or much smaller than the previous programmes,’ Stournaras said.

‘We are not talking about a new bailout but an economic support package without new (austerity) terms.’

A number of other high ranking European figures have already made it plain they believe a third bailout for Athens is unavoidable.

Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the powerful Eurogroup of finance ministers, said last week it was ‘inevitable’ a further financial lifeline would have to be extended to save Greece from collapse.

Germany’s commissioner to the European
Commission, Guenther Oettinger, also said over the weekend that he 
expects a fresh lifeboat of around 10 billion euros.

‘It
will be a manageable sum. I personally expect the figure to be a little
over 10 billion euros. The programme should cover the years 2014-2016, 
he told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

Opposition parties accuse Merkel of hiding the risks of more Greek aid before the polls.

As
the eurozone’s largest economy, Germany has the biggest exposure to 
Greece. Many German voters are resistant to funnelling yet more cash to 
prop up heavily indebted southern Eurozone members.

The
German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, last week started the 
debate about Greece by saying it would need fresh emergency aid to stay 
afloat.

Talk of a new 
bailout for the troubled country prompted renewed fears for the 
Eurozone, which recently clawed its way out of the longest recession in 
its history.

Greece remains mired in its sixth year of slump with record unemployment.

The
International Monetary Fund  estimated last month that Greece would 
face a funding gap of nearly  11 billion euros (£9,5bn) for 2014-2015.

Angela Merkel has repeatedly warned about writing off Greek debt or ‘taking a haircut’.

She
said: ‘I am expressly warning against a haircut. It could trigger a 
domino effect of uncertainty with the result that the readiness of 
private investors to invest in the Eurozone again falls to nothing.’

The
Eurozone as a whole grew by 0.3pc in the second quarter of 2013, edging
out of an 18 month-long recession, the longest downturn since the 
single currency was founded.

But
analysts from Capital Economics said: ‘The return to modest rates of 
economic growth in the eurozone as a whole won’t address the deep-seated
economic and fiscal problems of the peripheral countries.’
