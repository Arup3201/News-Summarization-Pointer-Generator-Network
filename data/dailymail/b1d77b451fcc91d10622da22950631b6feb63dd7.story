A friend of the Kings has spoken out in support of their decision to take their sick son, Ashya, to Spain.

Ricky De Sousa appeared on today's This Morning to defend Brett and Nagmeh King and called for them to be released from prison.

Mr De Sousa said the Kings were 'a normal family' who he met on the wards of Southampton General Hospital, where his own son was being treated for cancer. 

Shared ordeal: Ricky De Sousa said he told Brett King about proton beam therapy when he met him on the wards of Southampton General Hospital where his own son was being treated for cancer

He said he's appalled at how they have been treated and they should not be separated from their son. 

'The best interests for the child is for the parents to be next to him. At the moment he is in hospital without his parents,' he said.

The father revealed that he was the one who told the Kings about proton beam therapy, the treatment they sought abroad because it wasn't available to them on the NHS. 

'I would take my child anywhere to save him': Mr De Sousa said he thinks the Kings were right to take Ashya, pictured here with his father, Brett, to Spain for treatment

Needs his parents: Thousands have signed a petition calling for Nagmeh, pictured with her son, and Brett to be released from prison and reunited with Ashya, who is in a hospital in Malaga

He explained to presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'Like every parent there, between us we discussed treatments. 

'When we found out our son had cancer, we were looking everywhere for treatments and therapies like proton beam therapy. 

'In our son's case, he didn't need it but I did mention to Mr King about proton beam therapy and then he must have started researching it himself.'

Mr De Sousa said he had no idea how far the couple who go to gain the treatment and only became aware that they had left Southampton General Hospital after he saw it on the news.

But he confessed in their position, he would have done exactly the same. 

He said: 'You will do whatever it takes if you have a sick child. If we didn't have the treatment we needed for our son, we would have done the same. I would take my child anywhere to save him.'

Ashya's parents took him to Spain without consent last Thursday in the hope they could sell their holiday home on the Costa del Sol to raise money for specialist treatment.

Following their departure, they were arrested and jailed pending extradition for alleged 'cruelty to a person under the age of 16 years'. 

Their son, who is suffering from a stage four brain tumour, is now being cared for at the Materno-Infantil hospital in Malaga.

Free them: Mr De Sousa said the parents should be allowed to see their son

Since Saturday night, the five-year-old has been separated form his family and only his older brother Danny, 23, has been able to see him at Málaga's Hospital Materno-Infanti, where the brain cancer patient is being guarded by armed police.

So far today, more than 140,000 people have signed a petition demanding the jailed parents be released and allowed to visit their son.

Supporters went to Downing Street this morning to call on David Cameron to intervene and ensure the Kings are granted bail and allowed to leave a Madrid high security prison.

Mr De Sousa joined the calls for the parents to be released for their son's sake.

He said: 'If I went home when my son was he hospital, he would ring and say "Daddy, where are you?" It will have a big impact Ashya.'
