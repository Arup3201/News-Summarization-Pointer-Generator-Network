Spat: Literary agent Andrew Wylie has has slammed Amazon as an 'ISIS-like distribution channel'

A leading literary agent has slammed Amazon as an 'ISIS-like distribution channel' in a speech on the future of the publishing industry.

Andrew Wylie, also known as 'The Jackal' for his ability to negotiate  large advances from publishers for the authors he represents, made the claims in a keynote speech at a festival for authors in Toronto, Canada.

His anger at the online retailer stems from Amazon's 'brutal' tactics over royalties, comparing them to the terror group which has cut a swathe of terror across Iraq and Syria.

Mr Wylie, who represents heavyweights like Salman Rushdie, Philip Roth and Martin Amis, said: 'I believe with the restored health of the publishing industry and having some sense of where this sort of Isis-like distribution channel, Amazon, is going to be buried and in which plot of sand they will be stuck, [publishers] will be able to raise the author’s digital royalty to 40 per cent or 50 per cent,' he said.

'Writers will begin to make enough money to live.'

He also urged publishers to take a stand against the might of Amazon over royalties, adding that publishers should never have agreed to give the company 30 per cent of digital profits.

If publishers stand together they can exert influence over what he called a 'digital trucking company' to profit more from their digital book sales in the future, The Guardian reports.

Mr Wylie added: 'The publishing industry, up until now, has cowered and whined and moaned and groaned and given Amazon pretty much everything they want. Now I think that’s going to stop.'

His latest comments are not the first broadside he has fired at Amazon. In March he said: 'If you have a choice between the plague and Amazon, pick the plague,' and said its publishing programme 'stands out for its idiocy'.

He also turned his withering gaze on the self-publishing phenomenon and EL James' 50 Shades Of Grey calling it 'one of the most embarrassing moments in western culture.'

Andrew Wylie was born in 1947 in New York and raised in Sudbury, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard College in 1970, and in 1980 established The Wylie Agency in New York.

He also urged publishers to take a stand against the might of Amazon. Pictured, the Amazon Fulfilment Centre at Rugeley, Staffordshire, one of eight in the UK
