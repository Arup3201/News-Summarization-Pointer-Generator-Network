The sports presenter dubbed the Mexican Kim Kardashian says she's 'embarrassed' to be compared to the social media queen because she does more than 'just post photos online'.

Jimena Sanchez, who has garnered a following of more than a million Twitter and Instagram admirers for her raunchy posts on social media, said: 'Kim doesn't seem to do anything. My ideals are completely different than Kim Kardashian's'.

The presenter on the Spanish-language FOX Sports channel told MailOnline in Mexico City: 'It's surprising that Kim and her sisters have become so famous given that none of them have any special talents.'

Mexican Kim Kardashian: Jimena Sanchez has  a following of more than a million social media admirers

Put down: Sports presenter Jimena said: 'It's surprising that Kim and her sisters have become so famous given that none of them have any special talents'

'They don't seem to do anything, certainly nothing you could call talent. I dedicate my life to other things, I don't think we're anything alike'.

Miss Sanchez is smaller than she appears in her now-famous selfies - standing at just 5ft 5ins – and walks with the bouncy gait she has been noted for during her energetic performances on FOX.

She plays constantly with her hair and pouts her lips almost instinctively as she listens to other people speak.

Jimena, who describes herself as the 'sexy girl' of Mexican television, says she is passionate about sport and that being a professional journalist is what makes her different from the style-icon she is compared to.

'I love my job and I'm good at it,' she said. 'Physically we may be alike, but we aren't similar professionally.'

Despite not enjoying be likened to Kim, Jimena nevertheless admits there are certain aspects which are undeniably similar - and is obviously pleased with the publicity the comparison has brought.

Followers: When asked whether she is after the social media queen's crown, Jimena replied: 'It would be nice'

'I don't think I look anything like her, but we both use social media to publish sexy photos,' she added. That has made me the Mexican Kim Kardashian more than anything else.

'We are both popular because of our looks, and we're both very active on social media, so it's difficult not to draw comparisons, I just didn't think it was going to become such a big deal'.

When asked whether she is after the social media queen's crown, Jimena replied: 'It would be nice.'

But Jimena still has some way to go, with just under a million Twitter followers compared to Kim's thirty million.

'It's much more difficult to get followers in Mexico,' she complained. 'People here aren't as switched on technologically as they are in the US.'

Jimena said she has doubts about whether Kim is a good role model for young girls.

Originally from Veracruz state on Mexico's Gulf Coast, Jimena arrived in Mexico City ten years ago.

'I didn't know what to do at first, so just like everyone else who doesn't have anything to do, I started studying acting,' she laughed.

'I very nearly finished the course, but social media was coming out at the time and I was much more interested in that. I have always loved taking photos of myself and sharing them with other people'.

After dropping out of drama school, Jimena launched her Mad Mamacitas photo blog alongside best friend Hannah Sotelo - a website which quickly caught the attention of many internet users.

'It was a project which just involved taking sexy pictures of ourselves and our friends. We didn't expect it to go viral,' Jimena said.

Private life: Jimena receives a lot of abuse from internet trolls, many of whom question her romantic choices

Despite photos which seem to be copied directly from Kardashian's photo feed, Jimena claims she has no style icons

'It would be amazing to have 30 million followers like Kim does', she told MailOnline. 'But it's not a pressing objective of mine.'

Despite photos which seem to be copied directly from Kardashian's photo feed, Jimena claims she has no style icons.

'There's no one I really admire in terms of style,' she said. 'I make my own style by using the things I like. Generally in my Instagram photos I appear very messy.'

Jimena receives a lot of abuse from internet trolls, many of whom question her romantic choices, particularly her ex-boyfriend, Mexican television presenter Faisy Omar.

'I've learned not to publish anything from my private life as people can be very cruel,' she said. 

'Social media can open a lot of doors in your career, but you have to be very careful about what you reveal.'

On the future, she said: 'I'm the sexy girl on a sports channel, I'm not the sort of journalist who can make it to fifty years old and still have a respected opinion

After pausing, she replied: 'I really like writing.' 

On the future, she said: 'I'm the sexy girl on a sports channel, I'm not the sort of journalist who can make it to fifty years old and still have a respected opinion. 

'I will be in this job as long as my body can hold out, which probably won't be long because I hate exercising and love to eat.

'I'd love to end up in Los Angeles, that's a city I really love. But for the moment I'm concentrating on the television. I'm very happy in my job'.

'As for being like Kim, she looks happy in her reality television shows, but I'm not sure I'd want to live like her. 

'We're two people who owe everything to our looks, but there's not many other similarities'.
