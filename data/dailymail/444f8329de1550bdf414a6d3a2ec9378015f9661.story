Xabi Alonso is a cool customer most of the time but  the Spanish midfield maestro looked a bit too chilled out on the bench during Bayern Munich's 3-0 win over CSKA Moscow.

With qualification to the 16 of the Champions League already secured, Bayern boss Pep Guardiola choose to field a new-look side at the Allianz Arena and temporarily froze out the likes of Alonso and Arjen Robben.

But while most of fellow substitutes decided to have rugs over their legs to keep them warm, the former Liverpool star opted against (imposing a blanket ban, you could say).

Alonso observed the 3-0 victory from the dugout along with Brazilian defender Rafinha, Robert Lewandowski, Mitchell Weiser and Bayern Munich's German defender Sinan Kurt.

Thomas Muller, Sebastian Rode and Mario Gotze scored the goals and the Bayern substitutes evidently had enough opportunity to warm their hands applauding.

Now the competition really hots up as Alonso and Co are through to the knockout stages, the draw for which takes place at noon on Monday.

On the evidence of Wednesday night, they will not be caught cold.
