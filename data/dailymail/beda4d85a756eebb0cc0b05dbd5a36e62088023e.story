A woman who was hit by a truck while pregnant has woken from a coma to deliver a healthy baby girl.

Jenny Quiles, 36, suffered brain injuries after the truck slammed into her while she crossed the street in St Petersburg, Florida, on October 15. 

She was taken to Bayfront Hospital in critical condition but woke up on Wednesday.

Doctors decided to deliver baby Emmy by cesarean section then, even though she was not due to be born until December 1.

Father Angel Quiles set up a fundraising page to help with his family's care expenses after the accident, which has raised almost $10,000 so far.  

He posted a picture of his wife in hospital and wrote: 'This is my beautiful wife who got struck by a tow truck carrying our unborn baby girl. 

'Protecting her child, she covered her belly like any other mom to be would have done and took the impact to her brain where now both, mom and baby are fighting for there lives (sic).'

He added: 'I have nothing for the baby and the expenses we have with me unable to work are in serious need of your support (sic). Anything will help.'

'I really thought I was going to lose my wife,' he told Bay9 News.

'I thought I was going to lose my baby and here we are celebrating the fact that Emmy is born and Jenny is doing better today.'

'When Jenny gets out of this, I'm going to tell her thank you, thank you 10,000 times because if it wasn't for her protecting the baby at that time, we wouldn't have the baby or this conversation right now.' 

Mr Quiles was terrified he would lose both his wife and baby, but is thrilled that both are doing well in hospital
