Houston firefighter Jesse Gonzalez managed to completely surprise his police officer girlfriend and propose to her at a fake house fire over the weekend.

With the help of two Houston Fire Department stations and the Houston Police Department, Jesse emerged like a hero from a smouldering garage in full fire-gear to get down on one knee to the sounds of Bruno Mars' Marry Me.

His girlfriend Olga Peck looked stunned as she accepted his extravagant proposal, telling her romantic boyfriend, 'I love you, I can't wait to marry you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'

Working to a tight schedule, Gonzalez - an 11-year-firefighting-veteran - used his friends home to create the fake fire alert - complete with dry-ice smoke that billowed out of the garage.

Indeed, some of the firefighters were still on duty and would have had to rush off immediately if a genuine emergency was called in.

As it stood, Houston's Fire and Police Departments played along with Jesse's cute deception and made sure that she was the responding car to the fake fire.

Exiting her car at first she doesn't seem to understand what is going on, until Jesse emerged in full fire gear and makes it the perfect day for her as his friends look on.

The couple has been dating for about a year and said they have no date set but hope to tie the knot within the next year.

Firefighters were listening to their radios the entire time and monitoring any possible calls.
