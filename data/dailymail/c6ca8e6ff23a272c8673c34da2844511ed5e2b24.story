Big profit: Socialist George Galloway is set to make a 600 per cent profit on his house

It’s the property with a £1.5million price tag where a homage to Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara taking pride of place.

The five-bedroom detached house in London belongs to the country’s most famous socialist firebrand George Galloway, who is set to make a distinctly capitalist £1million profit from its sale.

The three-storey property was purchased by the politician for a snip at £220,000 almost 20 years ago in 1995.

He is has now set to make a 600 per cent profit on the house after putting it on the market for a hugely increased £1.5million.

The large red-brick townhouse, located on a quiet tree-lined street in Streatham, south London, boasts five double-bedrooms, three bathrooms and a huge 70ft garden.

It is filled with expensive antique furniture, plush rugs, chandeliers and four poster beds.

But despite these luxurious touches, the interior still bears hall marks of the left-wing MP’s presence.

One of the most telling clues is the framed black and white photograph of the Che Guevara, which hangs over a Victorian fireplace in the politician’s home office.

Mr Galloway has often spoken of his admiration of the Argentinian guerrilla fighter, describing him as his hero and professing to be a ‘soldier in Che Guevara’s army’.

Another sign that Mr Galloway owns the property is the two oversized wooden ‘G’s’ that act as bookends for a row of books just below this picture.

In the same room the MP for Bradford West, who has often been the subject of press interest, also has a framed picture of a newspaper frontpage.

Another personal touch in the master bedroom is a white heart-shaped frame hanging by ribbons from a chandelier above the four poster bed.

Grand: George Galloway's large house in Streatham

Dangling within this white heart is a photograph of the same shape which appears to contain an image of a married couple - quite possibly the Scottish politician and his fourth wife.

The 59-year-old, who celebrated his birthday on Friday, tied the knot with a Dutch-born consultant Putri Gayatri Pertiwi – 31 years his junior – in an Islamic ceremony in March last year.

And giving hints of Mr Galloway’s middle-east connections, also mounted over the bed is a framed depiction of Arab script in gold leaf.

The pictures of the rooms are part of selection that have been posted on a property website which states the price tag for the home as a hefty £1.475,000.

Meanwhile, the house is described as : ‘A beautiful and rarely available detached family home extending to over 3000 Sq Ft. Set back from the road the property benefits from off-street parking, large garage and 70’ mature and secluded garden. Internal accommodation comprises a large double reception room, separate kitchen, five double bedrooms, three bathrooms and a bright and beautiful galleried central landing.’

The upmarket home is worlds apart from Mr Galloway’s birthplace in Scotland - an impoverished tenement in the Irish quarter of Dundee.

The veteran politician bought the three-storey property just a year after he returned from a 1994 visit to Iraq where he pledged his support for Saddam Hussein with the memorable words: ‘Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.’

Firebrand: Galloway is famous for his revolutionary socialist views

In 2010 the MP was forced to tighten up security at his South London home over suspicions that a homeless person taken up residence there while he was away in Egypt.

He became concerned after his aides reported that his ties and shoes had been moved from room to room.

And teetotal Mr Galloway said his fears that someone had moved in upstairs were confirmed when he went to investigate wielding a sword and found an empty bottle of gin and gay video in a closet.

‘I have a sword, given to me in Saudi Arabia or somewhere,’ Mr Galloway said at the time of the incident.

‘So I unsheathed my sword and went upstairs.

‘There was no-one there, but there was a bottle of gin - which, of course, would never be in my house - and a gay video, which definitely would never be in my house.’

Estate agent Dexters confirmed they were selling the property but refused to discuss any further details.
