No bail: Amber Hilberling, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, is accused of pushing husband Joshua, through a window after he threatened to leave her less than a year into their marriage

A heavily pregnant newlywed accused of killing her Air Force husband by pushing him out of a 17th floor window has been denied bail.

Amber Hilberling, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, allegedly defenestrated husband Joshua, after he threatened to leave her less than a year into their marriage.

She was arrested soon after the incident in June 2011 and released on $250,000 bail.

But in January she was jailed for 
breaking her bond conditions after testing positive for marijuana and
repeatedly failing to recharge her electronic tracking tag.

Mr Hilberling fell from the 115 
metre University Club tower building where they lived on to a parking 
garage below - and when 19-year-old wife Amber was later arrested she is
said to have admitted that she pushed him.

Amber, who was more than seven months
pregnant at the time, denies second-degree murder, insisting he fell by
accident, blaming the apartment's operator for installing dangerously thin glass in the building.

Amber is said to have been escorted 
from the building shortly afterwards, where she 'made statements to 
witnesses that she pushed the victim and that caused him to fall through
the window,' according to the police report.

The couple had a history of domestic 
violence, according to court records, but 'it depends on what side of 
the family you talk to as to who is the more aggressive one,' Sergeant 
Dave Walker said at the time.

A month before his death, Mr 
Hilberling filed a protective order against his wife but the case was 
dismissed after neither turned up for the court hearing, according to 
True Crime Report.

Mr Hilberling had written in an 
official statement that his wife had taken a floor lamp and 
'pushed/threw the lamp at me and busted me in the head.'

He was taken to hospital after the incident and had to have ten staples and 11 stitches put in to close the wound on his head, he had claimed.

Mr Hilberling's parents said their son had tried to work through the domestic problems with his wife.

'I think that’s why he stayed with Amber as long as he did, because he thought he could fix it,” Patrick Hilberling told Tulsa World.

'When I saw the (Tulsa Police Department) Chaplain, I knew she killed him. She finally did it.'

Jeanne Hilberling described her son as 'just a sweet boy.'

'He’s always willing to help others,' she said. 'He would help others and neglect himself. He always had a smile and witty sense of humour.

'Writing on a Facebook memorial group, she added: 'He was trying to leave her. He called his dad at 3:30 and said his bags were packed - he couldn't take anymore.

'She charged him with all her insanity strength and pushed him out the window. He fell 17 stories and landed on the 8th floor parking garage.

'She admitted at the scene that she pushed him - no remorse - nothing. Even smiled at the by standers.'

Nikki Ross wrote: 'Josh-my brother is gone way to soon, I am praying that justice will be served. Jeanne and Dad, I pray that God surrounds you with peace and comfort.'

David Askew added: 'I just want to the time to thank everyone who has shown my family support. I'm going through a whole mixture of emotions right now & I don't think I'll get over the loss of my brother who I loved.

'Josh was a great guy and he will be greatly missed.'

Joshua was discharged from the Air Force and moved back to Tulsa in May 2010, where he was set to study to become a registered nurse.

He married Amber in August in Wichita Falls in Texas after graduating from Victory Christian High School, where he was a star football player.
