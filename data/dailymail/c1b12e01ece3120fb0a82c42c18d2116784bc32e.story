Being on the receiving end of a bird's droppings is meant to bring good luck, according to the superstitious.

But Kerry Morrison hasn't had much joy for the last four months. Her bizarre plan to make music based on bird poo, partly funded by the taxpayer, has run into difficulties - because of a lack of muck.

Since June, visitors to parks in Liverpool may have seen the self-proclaimed environmental artist laying huge, blank musical scores between trees and encouraging birds to do their business on them.

Bizarre: Environmental artist Kerry Morrison is trying to make music based on droppings, but the taxpayer-funded project has been hampered because birds haven't produced enough

Disinterested? Since June, Miss Morrison has laid huge, blank musical scores between trees and encouraged birds to do their business on them

Her plan was that the positioning of 
the splats on the stave would inspire a new musical work to be performed
 in the city's Tate gallery.

Unfortunately,
 the birds have been rather less than co-operative, and the 47-year-old 
is still waiting for sufficient offerings from the sky to create the 
piece.

The performance was initially 
expected to be held this month, but Tate Liverpool stressed it had never
 been scheduled for a specific date and denied the project was running 
late.

Miss Morrison, whose previous work has included an attempt to create art from dog mess, came up with the idea, entitled Bird Sheet Music, while sitting in a park with friends.

Launching the project in June, she described how it would ‘harness some of their (the birds') fundamental doings’ to take ‘by chance nature’s calls and represent what comes naturally’.

She went on: ‘I will be laying blank score - on a scale of great magnitude - underneath places where birds roost and feed.

‘As the birds go about their daily business, droppings will fall onto the score below.

‘Each splat on the score will form a musical note, a cache of poo, an embellished score: bird s*** music.’

The dropping marks were to be adapted by composer Jon Hering, but finding birds prepared to take part in the project has proved harder than expected.

‘I thought it would be very straightforward first of all - they sit in a tree, they eat, they poo, you get the bird music and there you go - Bob’s your uncle,’ Miss Morrison said. 'But it’s not like that at all.’

A film crew accompanied Miss Morrison for four hours last week, but the birds provided only one note - an E.

The artist said: ‘I have had to learn
 about bird behaviour and find out when and where they nest and perch, 
so my bird-spotting skills have developed considerably.’

It's oh so quiet: The bird dropping splats on the sheets are to be used for a new musical work to be performed at the Tate Liverpool

Perhaps Kerry Morrison should have followed the old adage 'Never work with children or animals'.

But she is not the first musician to have tried to involve the animal kingdom in her work.

The Beatles song A Day In The Life, from the 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, ends with an extremely high note which only dogs can hear.

The high note is said to have been dubbed into the track by producer George Martin at the request of John Lennon, pictured.

The Beach Boys' critically-acclaimed 1966 album Pet Sounds includes animal noises and even has a picture of the band visiting a zoo on the front cover.

And the video to dance act Basement Jaxx's song Where's Your Head At? featured monkeys with superimposed human faces.

Miss Morrison has been helped by artist Helmut Lemke, who is recording sounds of the woodland for a planned exhibition.

Although sheets with a 
combined length of more than 400ft have been suitably soiled, another 
160ft is needed before the composition can begin.

Miss Morrison, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, is studying for a PhD at Salford University and incorporates elements from natural landscapes or wild animals in her work.

Three years ago she invited walkers on a canal towpath to dodge dog mess, rewarding them with a sticker, a mug of tea and a biscuit if they succeeded.

Bird Sheet Music is one of four projects she is working on as part of Tate Liverpool’s series of outdoor exhibitions, Our Liverpool Landscape: From Turner To Today.

It is understood to be partially funded through a £50,000 grant made by the Arts Council towards the gallery’s major events programme.

According to the exhibition’s website the projects are also supported by the U.S. Embassy in London.

Tate Liverpool said no other public money funded Bird Sheet Music but declined to say how much of the Arts Council grant had gone towards it.

It said the U.S. Embassy had supported the gallery’s exhibition Turner Monet Twombly: Later Paintings which inspired the Liverpool Landscape productions, rather than the projects themselves.

A spokeswoman for Tate Liverpool said: ‘The project is ongoing because Kerry is still collecting the bird droppings for the music.

‘It is our intention to have the transcribed composition performed at Tate Liverpool by the composer Jon Hering in the near future.’
