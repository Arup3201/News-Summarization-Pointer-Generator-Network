Ed Miliband needs to ‘get out and mix with ordinary people more’ a veteran Labour MP said yesterday.

Austin Mitchell said his party leader needs to find a way of talking that brings issues ‘down to the level of’ ordinary voters.

The 80-year-old MP for Great Grimsby spoke out as he announced his retirement at the next election.

Worried: Mr Mitchell is just one of a growing number of Labour MPs who have expressed concerns about Mr Miliband¿s performance

Mr Mitchell voiced growing fears in Labour ranks that Mr Miliband has been unable to translate four years of political thinking into policies that can be sold on the doorstep.

Even close allies admit he is too prone to academic theorising, often wheeling out concepts such as ‘predistribution’ and ‘predator capitalism’. Mr Mitchell damned his leader with faint praise, telling The Guardian that Mr Miliband is ‘doing OK’.

‘He needs to get out and mix with ordinary people more,’ he said. ‘Policies will come over the summer but he needs to swing the public debate back to the people.’

Mr Mitchell is just one of a growing number of Labour MPs who have expressed concerns about Mr Miliband’s performance.

Former Labour chairman Hazel Blears recently urged him to talk in ‘normal human language’ to appeal to voters.
