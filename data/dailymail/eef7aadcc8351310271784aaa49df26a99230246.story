Washington Wizards point guard John Wall broke down in tears Monday night as he dedicated his win over the Boston Celtics to the little girl he had befriended who died of cancer that morning.

In an emotional post-game interview, the athlete was overcome with grief as he spoke about six-year-old Miyah Temaque-Nelson, who had been battling Burkitt's lymphoma.

'This is for Miyah, one of my close friends who I lost', he said. 'It's just tough. To see a little kid that fights so hard against cancer and can't beat it. This game's for her.'

'You're never like this. She really touched your heart, didn't she?' asked CSN Washington reporter Chris Miller.

Struggling to contain his grief, Wall - who had learnt of Miyah's death that morning via text message - was unable to respond as he began sobbing, and was led from the courtside.

'This game was really meant for her. It would've been an even tougher day to lose it,' Wall said. 'I just went into a mode where I didn't want to lose this game.'

'It was a tough day for him,' said coach Randy Wittman. 'I thought he handled it well, but he was hurting at the end.'

That night Wall posted a tribute to Miyah on his Twitter page saying that he would 'definitely miss my buddy', alongside photos of the pair together.

He wrote: 'If you were blessed to meet and get to know Miyah you know how special of a little girl she was. I'm saddened by the news but I know that she's in a better place. Keep her family in your prayers. I'll definitely miss my buddy. Rest In Peace Miyah.'
