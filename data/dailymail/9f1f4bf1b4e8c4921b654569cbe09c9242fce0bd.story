Jamie Carragher and Gleen Hoddle believe Jose Fonte was central to Southampton's historic 1-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford. 

The Saints centre back took home the man of the match award after a commanding display against Louis van Gaal's side who failed for land a single shot on target for the first time at home since May 2009.

Carragher heaped praise on Fonte after his stellar display and insisted that the Portuguese defender has filled the shoes of Dejan Lovren with aplomb since the Croatian's departure to Liverpool during the summer.

'We saw Lovren as the main man at the back (last season), but Fonte has taken that mantle,' Carragher told Sky Sports. 'There was no space for Wayne Rooney out there.'  

'The reason they have the best defensive record is not rocket science; they're just so compact and organised.' 

Gleen Hoddle shared Carragher's thoughts on Fonte after his performance at Old Trafford. 

Hoddle added: 'The players all respect him. From front to back, he was the pick of the bunch.'

Fonte was delighted with Southampton's result as the win moved his team up to third in the Premier League standings. 

The visitors took the lead after 69 minutes as substitute Dusan Tadic capitalised on Graziano Pelle's rebound to slot home his fourth goal of the season.

Juan Mata missed two great chances in succession as the hosts pressed for an equaliser with 10 minutes left, but Saints held on for all three points.

Fonte told Sky Sports 1: 'It's not every day you get a win at Old Trafford against a great team so for us it's a pleasure and something we should be proud of.

'There's a long way to go but it's another three points. We got a lot of confidence from this game.

'It was a game that we defended really well, and they only had shots from outside the box if I'm not wrong.

'It was a fantastic game this afternoon.'
