Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was welcomed by well-wishers in Nice today as he and his wife sought an emergency injunction to block further publication of their private phonecalls.

Sarkozy's conversations to Carla Bruni-Sarkozy were secretly recorded by adviser Patrick Buisson and then released on a French website and a newspaper.

The politician's lawyers requested €30,000 from Buisson plus a symbolic fine of just €1 against the online publication that posted the recordings, Atlantico.

The judge at the main Paris courthouse said a decision would be made on Friday.

Despite the scandal, Sarkozy - who has been positioning himself for a political comeback - was given a hero's welcome in Nice today.

He shook hands with well-wishers following the inauguration of the Institut Claude Pompidou in the city, a new centre on the Alzheimer disease.

Speaking at the event, Sarkozy avoided commenting on the secret recordings or the court 
hearing, acknowledging it only obliquely with a brief allusion to the 
journalists on his tail.

The recordings by Buisson include day-to-day discussions of a chief executive and his entourage. There's also chitchat between Sarkozy and Bruni, which was at the core of Monday's proceedings.

Atlantico said the recordings were published and transcribed 'for legitimate public interest' - but it has taken down those involving Bruni because 'she is not a political personality and never claimed any role as such.'

A ruling on the injunction will be made on Friday, judges said. Buisson's lawyer said Buisson had the recorder in his pocket - but never intended to tape the conversations

Buisson's lawyer said Buisson had the recorder in his pocket - but never intended to tape the conversations.

Last week, it emerged investigating judges were tapping conversations of the former French leader in an ongoing investigation into his 2007 presidential campaign funds.

The eavesdropping reportedly suggests that a judge called Gilbert Azibert was feeding Mr Sarkozy news about the investigation.

Mr Azibert is currently recovering in hospital following a fall at his home and cannot be contacted.

This included sensitive information related to allegations that Mr Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign was funded by Colonel Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator. These claims have been denied by Sarkozy.

Judges are looking into allegations that Muammar Gaddafi gave Mr Sarkozy more than £40 million to fund his 2007 presidential election campaign.

The tap allegedly reveals highly incriminating conversations between him and Thierry Herzog, his lawyer.

Mr Herzog can allegedly be heard telling Mr Sarkozy that Gilbert Azibert had been keeping him informed on a hearing due at the Cour de Cassation, France's highest court, this month.

The allegation that Mr Sarkozy has an informant at the highest level of the judicial system resulted in the opening of a criminal investigation into claims of influence-peddling and contempt of court last week.

Mr Sarkozy's lawyer, Mr Herzog, said denied any wrong doing on behalf of his client, and said there was a politically motivated plot against him.

Mr Sarkozy is still being tipped to stand for re-election in 2017, but such ambitions are fading by the day.

Some have questioned why the recordings emerged now, just two weeks before municipal elections that are seen as a test of strength for unpopular President Francois Hollande.
