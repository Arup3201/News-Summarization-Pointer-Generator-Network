From crocheted boyfriends to woolly teapots, it would seem there's little that can't be created with a pair of knitting needles and a few balls of wool.

But one Polish artist has decided to take things a step further and has covered an entire train with colourful crochet.

And by covering the full-scale Px48 steam locomotive engine and carriages in crochet, artist Olek - real-name Agata Oleksiak - says she has pulled off her largest 'yarn bombing' to date.

Hard work: It took Polish artist Olek two days working round the clock to completely cover this train in yarn

Impressed: The crochet-covered train has proved a hit with Lodz locals and will be on display until the 19th

Olek, whose previous projects include full body 'wearable sculptures' and a crocheted grapefruit, worked around the 
clock for two days in Lodz, Poland to cover the train in yarn, working 
with four assistants and braving cold, rainy weather to complete it.

'Yarn bombing' - also known as guerrilla knitting and yarn storming - is a type of street art that involves covering anything from trees to benches in brightly coloured knits.

Although yarn bombing has been around since 2004, this is the first time that anything as big as a train has been attempted.

According to Olek, the work, which will be on display until the 19th August, pays tribute to famous Polish poet Julian Tuwim, whose poem entitled The Locomotive is cherished in Poland and is being celebrated throughout the year.

Creative: Olek (above) has pulled off several yarn bombings and has even created wearable sculptures

Challenge: Olek and her team struggled to finish the piece, now entitled Deadly Romance

Intricate: Completing the gargantuan yarn bombing operation involved two days of continuous knitting

Olek has named the work Deadly Romance to reflect how gruelling it was to complete. She explains: 'We all know this particular poem about the Locomotive by Tuwim. It is probably one of the first things I had to memorise.

'It is nice to come back to Poland to be able to create such a powerful piece. I was in London at the Animal Ball in the presence of Prince Charles in July.

'Then early the next day I took a morning flight to Poland (wearing my costume and mask from last night) to work on the locomotive.

'I had the best crew ever. They worked as hard as I always do. I called this train 'Deadly Romance' as I love it, but it almost killed me.'

Completed: The vast locomotive and its carriages were thoroughly yarn bombed - despite the rainy weather

Vast: The scale of Deadly Romance is made clear when seen at a distance. The yarn will remain until the 19th
