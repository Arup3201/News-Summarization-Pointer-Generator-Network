A North Carolina woman nearly died after giving birth last month, when a blood clot in her leg shot straight to her lungs and she suffered a pulmonary embolism.

New mom Shelly Cawley survived the brush with death however, since she was already in an incubated sleep for the c-section and doctors were able to stabilize her condition.

Two days short of baby Rylan's one-month birthday, Mrs Cawley and her little girl were able to leave the hospital after recovering from the clot.

Going home: Shelly Cawley was discharged from the hospital this week, a month after suffering a pulmonary embolism during a c-section birth 

In an interview with WBTV, Mrs Cawley describes what happened in the moments after her emergency c-section on September 5.

She believes the weight of the baby had been blocking a blood clot in her leg, and once that weight was lifted the clot shot straight to her lungs - filling them with fluid. 

'Somewhere in those next moments the little bit of fluid in her lungs became a lot and all the doctors I talked to said if she wasn't already incubated and already put to sleep she would have died,' her husband Jeremy said.

Mrs Cawley says a crucial part of her recovery was hearing her newborn daughter cry, which brought her back to life to fight.

'Really what we did was, we got Rylan to cry as much as she could, and we prayed together. And you could see the doctors and nurses taking their time to pray as well,' Jeremy said. 

'I know that her vitals were completely backwards her blood pressure was way bottomed out, her heart rate was sky high. They told us since then she knew Rylan was there. And she reacted to Rylan being there. And that reaction helped her fight enough until they could get the other doctors involved from CMC Main.'

'I've been told the story - by putting her on my chest and making her cry was what brought me back,' Mrs Cawley said. 

On Friday, Mrs Cawley was finally cleared to leave the hospital and she was greeted outside by over 200 of her friends, family and supporters wearing purple 'Team Shelly' shirts. 

The group said a prayer before the Cawleys left to bring their new girl home.
