Temperatures rose to 61F in Sochi today, melting snow and raising fears that the blazing sun could ruin Russia's Winter Olympic Games.

Glorious sunshine was to blame for a hole dug at the top of the women's downhill course as the mercury soared to 16 degrees Celcius.

It got so hot on the slopes that athletes competing in the women's downhill were forced to stuff snow down their suits just to cool down.

'There's probably no snow left at the start because we were all putting it down our backs,' British skier Chemmy Alcott said. 'There's definitely a hole. We were like, "Just shove it down."'

Skiers were visibly uncomfortable under the beating sun ahead of their runs and it was even warmer in the finish area, where both athletes and fans were seen stripping off their layers.

Alcott crouched down behind a bunch of journalists to protect her fair skin. 'I'm trying to hide from the sun here because I feel like I'm getting red,' she said.

Fall: Laurenne Ross, another American, fell on the top portion of the course. Fortunately, she wasn't injured

The high temperatures also affected the race, with later starters having to deal with softer snow as it grew warmer and warmer.

'It was pretty warm snow and I don't think I adapted to it well,' said American racer Stacey Cook, who missed a gate. 'It slides under your ski more.'

Taking the temperatures into account, organizers injected the slalom course with water overnight to create a harder surface in the hope that it holds up for the second leg of the super-combi, which adds the times together from one downhill run and one slalom run.

It was 9 Celsius (48 Fahrenheit) shortly before the slalom leg.
