Andy Murray stepped up his US Open preparations with a solid performance to see off Joao Sousa in the second round of the Cincinatti Masters.

Murray looked strong and fit as he dispatched the world no. 37, winning the match in straight sets in a little over an hour.

The British number one got off to the perfect start, breaking Sousa's serve at the first time of asking, and never looked back.

Murray was given a bye in the first round, so this was his first outing since defeat to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Toronto last week. And the Scot was in no mood to hang around,dispatching his Portuguese opponent in 71 minutes.

It was an excellent performance from Murray with the US Open just a couple of weeks away. He will play the winner of John Isner and Marinko Matosevic in the third round.
