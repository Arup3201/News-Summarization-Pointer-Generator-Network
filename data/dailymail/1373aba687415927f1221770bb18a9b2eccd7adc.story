Newcastle and Manchester City both offered tributes to John Alder and Liam Sweeney ahead of their Premier League clash.

The pair died on flight MH17 as they were travelling to watch the Magpies' pre-season tour in New Zealand.

A minute's silence was held as Vincent Kompany and Fabricio Coloccini laid wreathes in the centre circle as both teams paid their respects.

Newcastle players wore special t-shirts commemorating the pair before their pre-season match against Sydney AFC. 

An online fundraising page set up in memory of the pair has raised more than £30,000.
