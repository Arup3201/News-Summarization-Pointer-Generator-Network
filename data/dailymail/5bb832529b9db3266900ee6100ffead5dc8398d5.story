A gang of men became Britain's biggest bike thieves after stealing hundreds of bicycles worth an estimated £75,000 from railway stations.

The three prolific criminals were caught on CCTV taking bikes from public places in London and the Home Counties before trying to sell them online.

More than 530 bikes were stolen from commuters and rail passengers who had left them in racks at train stations including at Richmond and Twickenham in London.

Leader Tomasz Brzezinski, 26, of Ealing, west London, was jailed for 30 months after admitting his part in the criminal operation.

Joshua Scott, of Brent, and Zayn Khan, both 19, were sentenced to 18 months imprisonment each, after pleading guilty to theft.

Officers were able to link the huge number of bike thefts after monitoring their activity online and on CCTV.

Police found that the gang had placed adverts for the stolen bikes online using their own email addresses.

Detective Sergeant Paddy Kerr said: 'These men were involved in an elaborate criminal conspiracy to steal bikes from public bike racks and then quickly sell them on for cash.

'They were organised criminals, targeting expensive bikes belonging to rail commuters. 

'By disrupting large-scale criminal activity like this, we can continue to reduce the number of bikes stolen from railway stations in the London area.'

Officers from British Transport Police found more than 460 online adverts they had put up to try to sell their stolen goods.

In one case a woman locked her Condor racing bike in the racks at Richmond station. When she returned later that day, the £900 bicycle was gone.

Officers later discovered that it had been sold online. 

A man’s £1,000 vintage bike was taken from the racks at Twickenham station and the following week he found an advert for his bike on the internet. 

The three men were jailed at Blackfriars Crown Court on October 17, after an earlier hearing where they all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal pedal cycles and conspiracy to transfer criminal property.
