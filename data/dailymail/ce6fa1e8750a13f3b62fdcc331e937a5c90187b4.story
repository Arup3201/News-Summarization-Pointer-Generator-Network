An ex-marine who endured 214 days in a Mexican prison after accidentally carrying loaded rifles across the U.S. border said he was treated 'like some kind of animal in a cage' and that his ordeal drove him to a suicide attempt.

Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, described how spending nearly seven months in the Mexican jail  drove him to try to take his own life with a smashed lightbulb after an escape attempt failed.

Speaking to Fox News in his first interview since being released last month, Tahmooressi said prison guards beat him when he was caught trying to break out. They then stripped him naked and left him strapped to the post of a bunk bed in the cold for eight or nine hours.

He told On The Record host Greta Van Susteren: 'I felt like guards outside were having fun with the whole thing, like they were mocking me outside, making fun of me, so that was hard. So I'm like some kind of animal in a cage here … like I don't even have life in me.'

Two or three days later Mr Tahmooressi said he tried to take his own life by breaking a lightbulb over the toilet and stabbing himself in the neck. 

'I was looking at these light bulbs as my way out,' he said.

But the guards heard  the bulb smash and took Mr Tahmooressi to the prison hospital, where he was given medical treatment and put on a drip.

'I got revived, I came back,' he said.

Wrong way: Mr Tahmooressi said he took a wrong turn on a California freeway that funneled him into a Tijuana port of entry with no way to turn back

Tahmooressi was jailed in March for crossing the border with loaded guns, in a case that led U.S. politicians to bring intense pressure on Mexico to release him.

He said he made the decision to try to escape because he became 'extremely afraid' for his life in the prison.

'I was very afraid. I felt like it would be the last night of my life right there, that these guys were going to kill me,' he said.

'That these guys were going to brutally kill me, I was thinking. I built up strength to run away because I thought running away was my only hope to get away from a situation like that.' 

Tahmooressi described having his arms and legs handcuffed to a bed because he 'wasn't a (well) behaved prisoner'.

'I believe they did it because they were afraid of me, afraid that I might do something again and really end up doing something like successfully killing myself or harming somebody and that they would get in trouble for it by not being able to control the situation,' he said.

Mr Tahmooressi said  he mistakenly wound up at a border crossing point in Tijuana and accidentally traveled into Mexico

At the time, Tahmooressi had loaded firearms in his truck. The weapons were purchased legally in the U.S., but it is illegal to cross into Mexico with guns. 

He was initially taken to La Mesa jail where he was put in a cell with 20 other prisoners. Mr Tahmooressi said that as an American he was feeling particularly vulnerable.

'So they see my weakness and I think they started taking advantage of my weakness, just to maybe have fun with me', he added.

'Or maybe they feel threatened by me because I was this odd-out guy, you know, kind of keeping to himself over there.' 

He was finally freed on the night of October 31 and reunited with his mother, Jill, and then boarded a flight to Florida in San Diego. 

The retired Marine said that at one point during his captivity he felt a shift in the Mexican corrections officers' attitude toward him.

'I was thinking, 'Hopefully these guys would be considerate and caring and understanding'… but I started feeling the things just… something shift there.

'They were very helpful and then it shifted, and then I knew this could be bad.'

Mr Tahmooressi, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, also revealed that he had been subjected to beatings, but he was unfazed by the violence.

'It was actually joyful to take that beating. I was happy to take that beating. I knew the beating was coming,' he recalled.

'They [fellow inmates] were telling me stories about the guards, about how if someone acts up or does something wrong, they get beat, so already I knew it was going to happen to me, so I was glad as can be to take that beating.

'I was like, bring it, just bring it on.'

When asked by Greta Van Susteren why he had the firearms in the vehicle when he crossed the border Mr Tahmooressi replied: 'Because I like guns,' 

'I enjoy guns, he added. 'You know, I grew up liking guns [...] It's like, you're stressed out and some people go and smoke a cigarette but some people go to the gun range and go shoot their gun and relieve some stress.'

Mr Tahmooressi's detention brought calls for his freedom from US politicians, veterans groups and social media campaigns. A US congressional committee held a hearing on the case.

In Mexico, possession of weapons restricted for use by the Army is a federal crime, and the country has been tightening up its border checks to stop the flow of US weapons that have been used by drug cartels.  

Mr Tahmooressi said he was beaten in jail by the guards, but he was glad to take the beating 

In his truck when he crossed the US-Mexico border in March, Mr Tahmooressi was carrying a rifle, shotgun, pistol and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

His attorney, Fernando Benitez, argued that Mr Tahmooressi carries loaded guns with him because his weapons make him feel safer. He added that the veteran is often distracted, which could have contributed to him becoming lost.

In his order, a Mexican judge did not make a determination on the illegal arms charges against Mr Tahmooressi but freed him because of his mental state, according to a statement from Mexico's embassy in the US.
