David Silva's renowned sense of timing was put to the test during a newfangled training session at Manchester City's Carrington ground on Tuesday.

In what appeared to be an elaborate incarnation of a fairground game involving moles, holes and hammers, the Spain international was pictured racing around a wall touching numbered circles as part of an exercise to improve reaction times.

Players including Frank Lampard, Stevan Jovetic and Pablo Zabaleta were put through their paces during the session after a hectic festive schedule that saw them draw level with Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea.

There was also an appearance from Sergio Aguero as the club's leading goalscorer steps up his recovery from a knee injury that has sidelined him since December 6.

The injury was a cruel blow for the Argentine who has scored 19 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions for Manuel Pellegrini's side this season. 

The City striker recently stated on his Twitter account: 'I wanted you to know I've already started field work. Slowly but surely I'll be back at the right moment. Thanks for the wishes!' 

Meanwhile, James Milner is relishing Manchester City's mini-break following the intense festive period.

The England international saved his side's blushes by scoring both goals as the Premier League champions edged past Wrexham 2-1 in the FA Cup third round of the weekend.

It brought the busy Christmas spell to a successful conclusion and left the reigning champions looking ahead to 2015 with plenty of optimism.

Milner told City TV: 'It is nice to have a spare week with the amount of games we have had and some of the injuries. Some of the lads have had to play a lot of games.

'It is important we recover now, and we use this week to refresh.

'It slows down a bit now but I think it has been a pretty successful festive period - we have closed the gap. We had one blip but have been on a pretty good run, even though we have had a few injuries.'
