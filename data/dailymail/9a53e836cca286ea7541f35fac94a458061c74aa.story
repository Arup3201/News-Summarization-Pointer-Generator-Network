Hard-partying Heisman winner Johnny Manziel was at it again on Friday when he showed up to a University of Texas frat party, only to be kicked out and show up at a second event on Saturday.

The controversial quarterback likely stirred ire when he showed up to the party, since he’s the star player for Texas A&M – one of UT’s biggest rivals.

What’s more, Manziel did his partying while wearing a Tim Tebow New York Jets Jersey after being told by his critics over the course of his high-profile summer break that he should be more like Christian minded Jets star turned Patriots player.

Fraternizing: Hard-partying Heisman trophy winner Johnny Maziel kept the booze train going this weekend with a stop in Austin for some University of Texas frat partying

According to Deadspin, a Youtube video shows Manziel’s make a hasty exit from a University of Texas frat party in Austin.

Someone yells ‘Get the f**k out!’ and a beer can is clearly lobbed at the unwitting football star.

He looks to be in high spirits as he leaves, nonetheless.

And there’s no surprise there. He’s had a fun-filled summer thus far, one in which he was kicked out of a summer football camp, as well.

Rivals: A Youtube video claims to show Manziel leaving a  University of Texas frat party on Friday amid jeers from the partygoers, whose school is an arch rival of the Heisman's winner's Texas A&M. A beer can can just barely be seen hurling toward Manziel, at left

Hasty retreat? Manziel left in a seemingly happy mood and didn't hesitate to attend yet another University of Texas party the following day

The rising football star was sent home from the Manning Passing Academy in Hibodaux, Louisiana, on earlier this month by ‘Archie Manning himself’ after allegedly spending a night out on the town and showing up late to some scheduled events the next day.

The news of his ‘late-night partying’ was first reported by Rumors and Rants over the weekend, while Busted Coverage released photos of Manziel, 20, out drinking with Eli and Peyton Manning.

Camp officials told local reporters that Manziel was ‘sick’ and had to leave early, while his father maintained that he came home to recover from dehydration.

So there: In an apparent jab at critics who've been telling him to behave more like the goodly Tim Tebow this summer, Manziel wore the former Jets player's jersey to a second party this weekend

Manziel was working as counselor at the camp, which helps develop high school football players, before he left early.

So, when the booze-loving athlete showed up to a second day of partying in Austin on Saturday wearing goodly Tim Tebow’s old Jets jersey, it’s no wonder reports portrayed it as a brazen jab at his critics.

‘The only way Johnny Football could give a bigger "F U" to the national media's recent coverage of him would be by rocking a Tim Tebow Jets jersey,’ wrote a sarcastic Fox Sports. ‘Wait... what!?!?!’

King of Spring Break: Pictures like this one, taken in March while Manziel partied in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, had the press calling 'Johnny Football' by a different name

Many wondered where Manziel's girlfriend Sarah Savage was when he was partying with lovely ladies in Mexico last March

Going strong: The Heisman trophy winner's Spring Break antics now seem to have been just the start of Johnny Football's off season partying

Manziel’s antics this summer are not his first.

The player who’s nickname has become a registered trademark received a different nickname of sorts back in March: King of Spring Break.

Pictures at the time showed the football star partying hard with friends in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico—accompanied by either bottles of liquor or scantily clad co-eds in just about every photo taken of him.
