After starring in London's West End production of Speed-The-Plow, Lindsay Lohan opted for a Christmas full of luxury as she jetted off to the French Polynesian island of Bora Bora.

And it was the luxurious villa the Alohilani the Mean Girls star plumped for as her base on the mesmerising haven in the Pacific.

The villa comprises of five independent suites, each one bursting with its own individual character - but it would have set the star back £72,000 a week ($108,866).

The Alohilani villa has five suites, five bathrooms and can cater for 10 people - but doesn't come cheap

While on holiday in French Polynesia, Lindsay Lohan took to Instagram to post her festive snaps

So what would LiLo get for her money?

The suites provide an intimate setting surrounded by unparalleled peace and quiet, all with terraces facing the lagoon and the amazing opportunity to enjoy your own private beach.

The Mean Girl star could take in the majestic view from the wonderful marbled swimming pool surrounded by a wooden deck, as well as enjoy a lazy wander to enjoy the sights and scents of the tropical garden.

Alohilani also offers high-end music and television gadgetry for entertainment, as well as the best broadband connection on the island so guests can upload all those jealousy-inducing snaps of your glorious surroundings.

However, despite the sumptious luxury that the villa offers, Lilo was dealt a blow on her classy break.

The 28 year-old-revealed on Twitter that she had contracted the mosquito-transmitted Chikungunya disease.

Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and swelling or rash.

Apparently there is no vaccine to prevent the virus or medicine to treat it with once infected.

The star did not reveal how serious her symptoms were. 

Lindsay shared this picture from French Polynesia and captioned it 'A day of serenity and happiness'

Lilo's holiday was tainted however as she contracted the mosquito-borne Chikungunya disease

But poor LiLo may did still manage to enjoy the private island in front of the property which means you can just head out and enjoy total and utter solitude in a real tropical paradise.

The ocean side of the property even houses a spot where you can watch the whales passing by on the endless horizon.

A spokesperson for Oliver's Travels, who manage the property said: 'The Mean Girls star stayed in the sumptuous villa for nine days over the festive break, enjoying the property’s private beach, private restaurants, and even its private island. 

'Of course, that kind of exclusivity comes at a a fairly hefty price, but hey – that’s Hollywood.'

Your stay in the villa will also allow you to take advantage of a private beach, complete with transport

Guests at the Alohilani will be treated to the best in modern technology, including super speed broadband

The villa will also offer the party to hold their own evening of dancing and entertainment on a marble floor

A one week stay in the villa costs £72,000 (£1,029 per person per night) and for two nights it is £41,555.

Bora Bora can be difficult to reach by public airplane, and you may have to take one of the international flights from Tokyo, Los Angeles, Auckland or Hawaii.

There is no public transport on the island, but as well as the boat, cars and bicycles are easy to hire if you fancy going exploring.
