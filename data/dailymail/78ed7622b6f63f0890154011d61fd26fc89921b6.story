As if the new season wasn't enough, Mad Men fans can revel in the news that sets from the show have been brought to life as part of a new exhibition at the Museum of the Moving Image (MOMI) in Astoria, New York.

The exhibition, entitled Matthew Weiner's Mad Men, lifts the lid on the creative process behind one of the most highly-acclaimed television series of all time, season seven of which - understood to be the last - is being launched on AMC.

Fans can see first-hand the familiar sets including the kitchen from Betty and Don Draper’s Ossining home and Don’s office, as well as costumes, props and advertising art. Also on display will be research material and notes written by Matthew Weiner, who created the program.

The exhibition, which runs until 14 June, offers the most candid insight yet behind the scenes at the iconic show, and is the first time that many of the objects have ever been shown in public. All have been selected by Weiner himself.

It offers unique insight into the series’ origins, and how its remarkable attention to period detail resulted in a vivid portrait of an era. 

The exhibition will be accompanied by other Mad Men-themed initiatives around New York City.
