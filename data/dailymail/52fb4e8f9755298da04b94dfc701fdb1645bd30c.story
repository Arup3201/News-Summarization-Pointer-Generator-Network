Iran said it arrested a reporter for The Washington Post, his Iranian wife and two other Americans on unspecified charges. 

Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, director general of the Tehran Province Justice Department, told reporters that the 'Washington Post journalist has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue', the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

'Iranian security forces are vigilant towards all kind of enemies’ activities, the official added,' the agency reported, without elaborating or naming the journalist.

Esmaili was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual 'Quds Day' rallies, held to express solidarity with Palestinians and oppose Israeli control of Jerusalem, The Washington Post reported.

He went on to denounce the 'Zionist regime's recent crimes in Gaza' and called for the trial of Israeli leaders in international courts. It was unclear whether the grievances had anything to do with the arrests.

The Post earlier said that its Iranian correspondent Jason Rezaian, his wife Yeganeh Salehi and two American freelance photojournalists had been detained, which U.S. officials confirmed.

'We have received credible reports that Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post and his wife Yeganeh Salehi were detained on Tuesday evening in Tehran,' the paper's foreign editor, Douglas Jehl, said in a statement.

Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gives a speech in Tehran in July. Al Khamenei has the final say on all matters in Iran and has eventually released detained Americans in the past, though not always

'We are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them. As the Post's correspondent in Tehran, Jason is an experienced, knowledgeable reporter who deserves protection and whose work merits respect.'

The newspaper said Rezaian, 38, holds both American and Iranian citizenship. His wife is an Iranian citizen who has applied for U.S. permanent residency and works as a correspondent for a newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates.

Joshua Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd were detained in 2009 while hiking along the Iran-Iraq border. Shourd was released in 2010, while the two others were let go in 2011 following sentences of eight years for spying

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the department was aware of the report, but could not comment further due to privacy considerations.

The incident comes at a tricky time for the U.S. and Iran. The countries are in negotiations over its nuclear program.

The detentions come as the Iranian authorities step up pressure on independent journalists and bloggers, according to BBC News. At least 64 journalists and social media users are currently imprisoned in Iran, according to media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders.

President Hassan Rouhani's election in August 2013 raised hopes of a change in attitude in how the government handles dissent, on which it cracked down following the 2009 democracy protests. Some reporters were released from prison and Ministry of Intelligence representatives in his cabinet began to take a more relaxed approach toward media.

At the same time, journalists have come under renewed pressure from the judiciary and Revolutionary Guards, which operate outside the government's control.

Rezaian, who has been the Post's correspondent in Iran since 2012, and the others are just the latest U.S. citizens to be detained in Iran, where they are typically held in solitary confinement for months or years and accused of being spies.

Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd were picked up in 2009 while hiking near the border between Iran and Iraq's Kurdish region. The men were sentenced to eight years in prison, while Shourd was released on 'humanitarian grounds'. The other two were eventually released in 2011.

Robert Levinson, Amir Hekmati, and Saeed Abedini have languished in Iranian jails for anywhere from one to seven years on charges ranging from espionage to ones related to religion.
