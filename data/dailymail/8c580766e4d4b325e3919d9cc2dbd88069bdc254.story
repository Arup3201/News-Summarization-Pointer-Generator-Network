Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw in Schalke as their Champions League campaign got off to a disappointing start.

Cesc Fabregas gave the Blues a first-half lead but Schalke hit back through Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to earn the visitors a point.

 Cesc Fabregas had an up and down evening

Cesc Fabregas showed the best and worst of his game on Tuesday night. There was aggression to win the ball, that ability to set the tempo with his passing and his goal. But he also faded in influence, missed a fine chance to make it 2-0.

Kevin-Prince Boateng's game hasn't changed 

Kevin-Prince Boateng has lost none of the prickly aggression that saw him end Michael Ballack's World Cup chances in 2010. His crunching tackle in the FA Cup ensured Ballack's last game for Chelsea would be short lived. 

On Tuesday night Eden Hazard decided to take on the former Portsmouth player with a trick or two - only to run head-first into a cynical body check.

Stamford Bridge silent

Long gone are the days when English clubs provided the atmosphere in Europe. It's generally down to away fans to create any volume and last night was no different with Schalke's followers providing a steady stream of chants and songs despite their club's poor start to the Bundesliga.

 Close shave for Becker

After Adrian Chiles, Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Lee Dixon were doused by sprinklers last week, Boris Becker, an analyst for German TV, came perilously close to being soaked pitch-side last night, managing to maintain a straight face as he broadcast to the nation as a light drizzle sprayed the back of his Alan Partridge style sports jacket.

0 - that was the number of goals Schalke had scored against Chelsea in four previous outings. But despite being injured-ravaged and out of form in the Bundesliga they deserved the Klaas-Jan Huntelaar goal last night
