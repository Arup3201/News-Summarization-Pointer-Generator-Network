A hero Marine who was left paralyzed by a sniper's bullet in Afghanistan defied the odds and  walked again using robotic leg braces in a moving ceremony at Camp Pendleton.

Captain Derek Herrera saluted proudly as he took part in the ceremony in California, where he was awarded the much coveted Bronze Star.

The special operations officer was given the award for his actions on June 14, 2012, when the patrol he was leading came under heavy fire in Afghanistan.

Despite being wounded, brave Herrera continued coordinating efforts while receiving treatment for his own spinal injury and collapsed left lung.

On Friday, he was watched by a crowd of 300 Marines who fell silent as the Captain received the honor and all that could be heard was the faint whirring of electric motors from the device.

Herrera stood, holding onto one crutch. With his other hand, he saluted his commanding officer, who presented him with the award.

Lieutenant Colonel John J. Lynch, commanding officer of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command, said: 'Your drive and determination are great and you will continue to do great things.'

In a show of grit and determination, Herrera had vowed to walk at the event that also marked his retirement after 8 and a half years in the military.

He said he wanted to leave the Marine Corps the same way he joined and has gone from fighting on the battlefield to becoming a strong advocate for veterans.

'I'm not out of the fight and I'll continue on,' he told his battalion, adding that it was 'truly an honor and a pleasure to stand before you today.'

He was recommended for the accolade by Major Gen. M.A. Clark.

He wrote: 'The bravery and fortitude he displayed inspired his men to heroic feats as they valiantly fought to save the lives of their wounded team members and repel the enemy assault. 

Left paralyzed from the chest down, the 30-year-old Marine sought to be allowed to remain on active duty and has pushed himself to get back to walking. 

His last day on active-duty is November 30.

Herrera was the first person in the United States to purchase the ReWalk system recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the company, ReWalk Robotics Ltd.

The ReWalk is a robotic exoskeleton system that allows people with spinal cord injuries to stand and walk. 

Several competing products that use the technology — nicknamed 'electronic legs' or 'powered exoskeletons' — are also being used and tested in U.S. rehab hospitals. 

None so far are fast enough to entirely replace wheelchairs.

ReWalk was cleared by the FDA for personal use, although it has been on the market outside the United States since 2012.

The device consists of leg braces with motion sensors and motorized joints that respond to subtle changes in upper-body movement and shifts in balance. 

A supportive belt around the patient's waist keeps the suit in place, and a backpack holds the computer and rechargeable battery.

Crutches are used for stability, and the FDA requires an assistant be nearby. Herrera's wife assists him.

The MARSOC Foundation, a charitable fund for members of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command, raised the money for Herrera to buy the $69,500 device.

Today, Herrera is working on a master's degree in business administration at the University of California, Los Angeles and plans to start his own business.

'Every day is a choice to live, love, inspire, honor the fallen, make the world a better place and walk in the footsteps of giants,' Herrera wrote in a column for UT San Diego in 2013.
