Surgery delay: Janine Gower lost her baby

When Janine Gower starred as an NHS nurse in the London Olympics opening ceremony, she took pride in representing what she regarded as a great national institution.

Two years on, her pride has been replaced by embitterment.

She is suing the Health Service, claiming that she nearly died when her ectopic pregnancy was misdiagnosed.

Miss Gower, 29, was admitted to A&E after waking up in excruciating pain. She lost her baby – and says she almost died as well, after doctors failed to spot she was bleeding internally.

She says the mistake meant she needed a transfusion after losing four pints of blood, and may have left her unable to have children.

Miss Gower, an IT analyst for the Royal Free London NHS Trust, is suing for clinical neglect. 

‘I work for the NHS. I know what good treatment is and what bad treatment is,’ she said. 

‘It was terrifying. I don’t want anyone to go through what I have been through. The NHS faltered at every hurdle. They were completely negligent.’

Miss Gower was one of 600 NHS workers cast for the London Olympics’ tribute to the Health Service. She described the opening ceremony, in which she wore a nurse’s uniform, as ‘by far the most amazing experience of my life’.

Earlier this year, she discovered she was pregnant but was told it was ectopic, meaning the child was developing outside the womb. 

Miss Gower, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, was given injections to stop the foetus growing and was told she would probably lose her baby, although she still had hopes it would survive.

In May, six weeks after the initial diagnosis, she woke up in excruciating pain and returned to Northwick Park hospital in Harrow, North-West London. Miss Gower spent more than eight hours drifting in and out of consciousness and lost her baby.

She was initially told the foetus was in her cervix rather than one of her fallopian tubes – a misdiagnosis which led to crucial delays in her treatment. 

One of her fallopian tubes had in fact ruptured, and needed to be removed. Miss Gower says the operation was only performed after midnight, ten hours after she arrived.

She adds that her chances of becoming pregnant again have been reduced as a result.

Miss Gower, who recently split from her partner, has hired solicitors to sue the NHS for a payout which would fund IVF treatment, in case she needs help to conceive again.

‘I lost half the blood in my body ... I was in shock for weeks after,’ she said. ‘I started to get better and then I started to have emotional problems. I felt very low.’

A hospital investigation has conceded there was a critical delay between 7pm and 10.30pm, when she should have been operated on following her re-admission to hospital.

Carole Flowers, Northwick Park’s director of nursing, has apologised for the ‘anxiety and trauma’ Miss Gower suffered.

She said the doctor who treated her ‘would like to offer profuse apologies’.

David Weston, of London North West Healthcare NHS Trust, said: ‘We have responded in full and apologised for the upset caused to the patient.’
