A British has inventor has unveiled the ultimate Star
Trek gadget - a £650 handheld scanner that could be used to copy almost
any item.

The Fuel3D scanner, originally developed at  Oxford University, can capture everything
from a flower’s petals to the contours of human skin.

It is able to capture images in seconds, and they can
then be sent to a computer for processing.

When combined with a 3D printer, it could be used to
create 3D copies of everything from broken parts to 3D portraits.

‘The explosion of 3D printing and the continued expansion
of the games market means that there is an increasing demand for 3D scanning
products that capture high resolution 3D data,’ said Stuart Mead, the head
of  Fuel3D Inc, the firm using the Kickstarter site to raise money for the scanner.

‘With Fuel3D, our goal is to bring high quality 3D
scanning to a wider market by making it available at an affordable
price-point.'

Experts say the scanner could kickstart the popularity of home 3D printers.

‘Right now, a large obstacle to 3D printing adoption is the difficulty in producing the digital 3D models required,’ said Roger Chang, CEO, Pirate 3D, a 3D printing firm.

When you take a picture on a conventional 3D mobile phone or digital camera you are using a technique known as stereoscopic imaging.This uses two camera viewpoints, one for each eye, to display a ‘3D’ image on a stereoscopic screen that gives the impression of depth.In contrast, the core technology behind Fuel3D fuses geometric and photometric stereo 3D capture - producing both the shape and exact colour.This raw capability provides the opportunity for an object to be captured in true 3D geometry and full color for any other non-medical applications.

‘A high quality affordable scanner will really change the 3D printing game and Fuel3D’s 3D scanner looks set to put 3D modelling capability into everyone’s hands.’The technology behind Fuel3D was originally developed within Oxford University and was, at first, developed for medical imaging applications.'With Fuel3D, we plan to adapt a technology that has already been proven in the medical sector to deliver a new 3D scanning option to professionals and consumers with a passion for 3D creativity,' said James Paterson, who developed the scanner.‘The unique technology that we have developed allows us to offer what is literally a point-and-shoot approach to capturing both 3D data and colour, and we are confident that no one else in the world is able to offer this kind of solution at the price that we can achieve.'

The above sequence shows a selection of prototypes and concepts that have led to the Fuel3D scanner. Experts say the scanner could kickstart the popularity of home 3D printers
