A five-day trip with six mates to Ibiza, followed by a night out with a glamorous model in Dublin.

Is Rory McIlroy turning into one of those 24-hour party people?

Such is the uncommon fascination with the Northern Irishman’s social life, perhaps we better start by dealing with what he’s been up to since he played in the Irish Open two weeks ago.

In the public eye: McIlroy's Ibiza holiday and his night out with model Nadia Forde have hit the headlines

After all, a week in Ibiza with the boys conjures up all sorts of images, doesn’t it?

‘We did a few of the things lads do when they go to Ibiza, but it wasn’t one of those lads’ holidays,’ he said, laughing. ‘We had a nice boat and we stayed on that and went out to sea every day, so it wasn’t your typical lads trip.’

And the night out in the fair city when he got home, sparking the usual frenzy in the gossip columns and beyond?

‘I’m clearly not playing well enough if people don’t want to talk about my golf,’ he said, without a trace of rancour. ‘Let’s just say I’m very single and very happy at the minute.’

There’s more than one way to experience ecstasy, of course, and McIlroy is hoping to follow in Novak Djokovic’s footsteps and find it after leaving Ibiza.

‘I know Novak spent some time there after the French Open, so let’s see if I can follow his example at Wimbledon and win The Open,’ he said.

Before all that, there is McIlroy’s decision to follow Phil Mickelson’s example and end his five-year exile from the AAM Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen today.

‘I played with Phil for the first two rounds at the Open at Muirfield last year and you could see he was ready to play, that his game was really sharp,’ said the 25-year-old, about the American who opened so many eyes with his Scottish Open and Open double last year.

'You could tell he had played competitive golf the week before and even then I was thinking I might play the Scottish next year. There’s a few of us that Phil really influenced in that regard.’

There might be a few who will wish they hadn’t been swayed come Sunday, for this glorious links is far removed from the rather benign test presented by Castle Stuart last year.

In 1996 the Scottish Open was staged at a similar beast in Carnoustie and Colin Montgomerie was among those who raged as he walked off the 72nd green, claiming his swing had been ‘destroyed’ and his chances at the Open in tatters.

‘There’s certainly a case for saying this will be a harder test than next week’s,’ said McIlroy, who played at Hoylake at the weekend. ‘I think we all know this is going to be quite a challenge, and particularly with the weather forecast of wind and rain for a couple of days.

'But I am trying to adopt the mindset of relishing that challenge. If the conditions get really bad then yes, it is going to be a tough week and a long slog.

'But I don’t see how it should affect anyone’s chances next week. You can take Monday off and then get back at it, so I don’t have any concerns on that front.’

Three years ago, McIlroy had so many concerns about links golf he had a little moan after playing in the wind at Royal St George’s. A top ten finish in the Irish Open in frightful conditions at Royal Portrush the following year was the start of a change of heart.

‘I played pretty well but what was more pleasing was the fact I was playing the shots that you need to play on a links, which was more important than my scores,’ he said.

McIlroy was asked the inevitable question about Tiger Woods’s return next week and admitted his surprise he was playing in the Open so soon after his return from back surgery.

‘I don’t think I would want to start back at a major under that amount of pressure but he’s done it for so many years and knows how to deal with it well,’ said McIlroy. ‘He’s missed a chunk of the season and I am sure he wants to get into the FedEx Cup play-off events in August at least and maybe push for a Ryder Cup place.

'So I wouldn’t write him off completely next week. I still think he can do things that we don’t see from any other golfer, so we will see what happens.’

As he walked off the 18th green following his pro-am round yesterday, McIlroy went straight to a television interview. Sam Torrance was nearby. ‘It’s behind you!’ said Sam. When McIlroy duly turned round, he saw the sparkling Claret Jug. McIlroy’s answer, however, would surely gladden the heart of the sponsors.

‘I said to him: “I will focus on that next week,”’ said McIlroy. ‘You know, we shouldn’t forget this is one of the big titles in Europe.

'Believe me, if I’m in contention come Sunday afternoon, I won’t be thinking about anything else but trying to win the Scottish Open.

'When I won the PGA at Wentworth in May it might not have been quite in front of a home crowd but it was in front of fans who were really supportive. And I think it would be the same here.’
