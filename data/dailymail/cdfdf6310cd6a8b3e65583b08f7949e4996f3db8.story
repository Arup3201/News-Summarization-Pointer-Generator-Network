A police officer was charged with 
attempted murder and arson after allegedly firebombing his supervisor's 
home while the man and his family were asleep inside.

Michael
Dotro, 35, a ten year veteran of the Edison, New Jersey police 
department is suspected of setting fire to his police captain's home, 
though no motive has yet been revealed.

Dotro allegedly set Captain Mark Anderko's home ablaze with a Molotov cocktail in the early hours of the morning while the Anderko, his wife, two young children, and 92-year old mother were sound asleep in the house.

Though the fire caused damage to Anderko's home, no injuries were sustained by him or his family, CBS New York reports.

Dotro
was charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of 
aggravated arson. He is being held on $5 million dollars bail.

Dotro's attorney revealed to New Jersey News 12 that his client has been questioned by police and search 
warrants were executed for his home and car.

The officer's longtime Police Benevolent Association representative Lawrence Bitterman was stunned by his arrest.

'I find it utterly incomprehensible to believe that Mike ... could ever be involved in 
anything like this,' Bitterman told NJ.com.

'I’ve spoken to him, and he 
adamantly denies any involvement and expresses his condolences to the 
Anderko family. He is sickened at the thought of someone doing this to a
brother officer, or anyone else, for that matter.'

Edison, New Jersey Police Captain Mark Anderko's (seen here) home was firebombed while he and his family were asleep inside. The arson is suspected to have been committed by Michael Dotro, one of the officers under Anderko's command

However, this is not the first time that Dotro has been linked to incidents of arson and violence, the website reports.

In 2008, Dotro got into a physical altercation with his neighbor Dennis Sassa.

The
68-year old neighbor claimed that Dotro punched him several times as a 
result of an argument over a shed belonging to Sassa on Dotro's 
property.

Shorty before the altercation Sassa's shed was set on fire, the flames from which spread to his camper and home.

At
the time no one was charged, but in light of the new incident Sassa was
once again questioned by investigators, he told NJ.com.

'They asked me about incidents that occurred at the time, and one of 
them was the fire with the shed. They were particularly 
interested in that,' Sassa told the website.

Police Captain Mark Anderko's home (seen boarded up in a close up above) sustained extensive damage after it was firebombed in the early hours of the morning. The suspected arsonist is Michael Dotro, a New Jersey police officer with a history of disciplinary problems

The same year his neighbor's shed 
burned down, Dotro was one of the main suspects in the theft of a police
car from the Edison department's secure lot.

The
incident was later believed to be a practical joke played Dotro and two
of his fellow officers, but it caught the attention of FBI's Joint 
Terrorism Task Force.

Dotro was never formally charged in the incident.

Earlier
in 2005 Dotro was accused of brutality by an Asian-Indian man he 
arrested. Once again he was cleared of the charges, this time after a 
series of local protests.

If Dotro makes bail on this attempted murder charge he is expected to surrender all firearms and his passport, CBS News reports.

Dotro
is not the only officer from the Edison police force to be surrounded 
by scandal, as the entire department has been accused of misconduct for 
years, according to CBS News.

An
investigative story by The Star-Ledger last December revealed that 
amongst other incidents, the police department has allegedly failed to 
effectively target officers accused of brutality.

Antonia
Ricigliano, Edison Mayor, was devastated to hear that the arson 
investigation lead back to one of the city's own law officials, she said
in statement to News 12 New Jersey.
