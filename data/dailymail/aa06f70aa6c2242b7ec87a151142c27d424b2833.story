One heartless real estate agent in Ocean City, New Jersey called out an elderly couple for parking on their lawn, ruining the neighborhood for wealthy clients.

Bill Doughten, 78, and his 79-year-old wife Barbara received the letter at their Ocean City, New Jersey home on Tuesday.

The letter, which had no return address, read:

'I'm trying to sell million dollar homes in the neighborhood. I drive my clients around and they see your car parked sideways on the front lawn! You have a driveway - use it!'

'You have a driveway - use it': A real estate agent in Ocean City, New Jersey sent the above letter to an elderly couple, saying their car parked on the lawn was ruining the neighborhood for potential buyers

Cowardly: Mr and Mrs Doughten called the letter, sent without a return address a 'sneak attack'

'It's like a sneak attack,' Mr Doughten told NBC 10. 'No name. They didn't say who they were.'

The letter enraged both the Doughtens and their grandchildren, who posted the letter on Facebook and it has since garnered over 700 shares.

'I have to say, that I have seen sales people do some pretty scum bag things in my life, but this may take the cake,' granddaughter Stephanie Powley wrote.

'I hope someone recognizes your handwriting so that your wife (long shot that you have one), your boss or even YOUR GRANDPARENTS know who you are,' she added.

Accessibility: Mr Doughten says he parks on the lawn so he can be closer to the front door to bring in groceries

Humble: Mrs Doughten says their neighborhood doesn't have any million-dollar homes

Mr Doughten said he parks the car on the grass so he can be closer to the front door when he brings in groceries. He says his advancing age means his leg doesn't work and he shakes.

The couple say they aren't going to change their habits just because of one anonymous note.

'I can do whatever I want to do,' Mrs Doughten said. 'I'm not moving the car. I don't know of any million dollar homes in this neighborhood.'
