Jailed: Ali Ehsan has pleaded guilty to sexual assault after groping a young woman on a bus

A doctor from Pakistan has been jailed after drunkenly assaulting a young woman whom he had followed off a bus.

Ali Ehsan had arrived in Britain just a month before the attack, which took place when he had been drinking heavily because he was away from his family during the Islamic festival of Eid.

The married 31-year-old sat next to the woman and put his hand on her thigh, then followed her when she alighted from the bus.

He grabbed her and sexually assaulted her, at which point she kneed him in the groin and ran away.

Ehsan, a junior doctor at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, was caught after police issued CCTV images of him on the bus during the incident on August 10.

He pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was given an eight-month prison sentence at Bournemouth Crown Court.

A judge heard that Ehsan had left his family for the first time a few weeks earlier after he landed the prestigious hospital job.

His defence lawyer said he was 'a fish out of water' in Britain and was not used to drinking alcohol.

Anita Gibson-Lee, prosecuting, said that the incident took place on a night bus on the outskirts of Bournemouth around 11pm.

'While on the bus, the victim first thought she was being subjected to a pick-pocket,' she said. 'The male put his hand down by her pocket and was touching her thigh.'

She said the woman got off the bus early, but Ehsan followed her before carrying out the assault.

'Once off the bus, he then asked the woman where they were and offered her a cigarette before beginning to walk along with her.

'He grabbed her hand. She tried to pull away but he put his hand inside her sleeveless top. He swung her around.

'She said she attempted to escape but he grabbed her again and put his hand down her pants.'

Ehsan walked away after the woman, in her early 20s, lashed out at him.

Tom Horder, defending, said Ehsan had been drinking on the second night of Eid al-Fitr, the festival which marks the end of Ramadan, because he was upset at being away from his family during the festivities.

Ehsan claimed the victim had whispered 'follow me' as she left the bus, and had told him he would have to pay to touch her.

Mr Horder said: 'He was somewhat isolated. He was a fish out of water in Bournemouth. He'd never before left Pakistan and he lived a very conservative lifestyle there based around his family.

'He was without the usual social cushion provided by friends and family. In order to occupy himself, he started drinking. This is something completely alien to him both religiously and culturally.

'He fully understands and knows that being drunk is in no way mitigation but it does play a part in explaining how he became involved in that way on the night in question.

'Not only was he drinking at the time the offence was committed, he was at a particularly low ebb in life. It was the second day of Eid, a time when family comes together.'

Ehsan will leave Britain after serving his prison sentence, so the judge opted not to impose a deportation order.

A spokesman for the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Mr Ehsan had only just joined the Trust and had therefore been working under supervision.

'All of our medical staff undergo a rigorous employment process with strict reference checks.'
