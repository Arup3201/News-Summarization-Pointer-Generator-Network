A 46-year-old woman has reportedly become the oldest mother to give birth through IVF using her own fresh eggs.

Belinda Slaughter delivered her first child - a healthy boy called Jackson - despite doctors giving her only a one per cent chance of conceiving.

Speaking of her relief and joy, the dental hygienist, from Orlando, Florida, in the United States, said: 'I was willing to take the chance of it not working, but believe in God that it would.'

She is thought to have made medical history because although mothers older than her have given birth through IVF, they have been with donor eggs or frozen embryos.

Mrs Slaughter's, however, were her own and fresh.

Dr Richard Paulson, a medical director of the fertility program at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'What's remarkable about this case is not the age of the mother so much as the age of the egg, which was 46 years old.'

Mrs Slaughter, whose case was published in Fertility and Sterility, a journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said she had no idea of the record.

A woman is born with a set number of eggs to last her lifetime.

This is thought to be around one million, but reduces to some 400,00 by the time they start puberty - and only a fraction of these will fully mature.

But the quality of the eggs also declines with age which makes it far harder to conceive later in life.

Around 7million American women are believed to suffer from infertility, with poor-quality eggs a factor in around 70,000 of those.

'I didn't think this was so special,' said Mrs Slaughter, now 47.

'I thought "there are women older than I am having babies".'

Rajo Devi Lohan, from India, is currently the world's oldest mother after giving birth to a daughter at the age of 69 in 2008 through IVF not using her own fresh eggs.

According to Guinness World Records, the oldest person to have a baby naturally, without infertility treatment, was a 59-year-old British woman who gave birth in 1997.

Mrs Slaughter turned to IVF after having an operation to remove 18 fibroids - non-cancerous tumours - from her uterus.

Dr
 Mark Trolice, founder and medical director of Vivere-Winter Park 
Fertility Laboratory, harvested the eggs from her ovary in March last 
year.

He then fertilised them with her husband 
Torrance's sperm and transferred the embryos into her ovaries, one of 
which successfully implanted.

Mrs Slaughter gave birth in September but not before needing a caesarean section nine weeks early after her cervix weakened.

She said: 'I always knew it was going to work.'

Although Mrs Slaughter required IVF, it is not uncommon for women her age or older to give birth naturally.

Actress Halle Berry recently admitted she was dumbfounded when she found out 
she was expecting son Maceo at 47 because she had been feeling 
'premenopausal' and didn't think she could conceive.

Meanwhile, Oscar-nominated actress Laura Linney gave birth to her first child, a baby boy, in January at the age of 49.
