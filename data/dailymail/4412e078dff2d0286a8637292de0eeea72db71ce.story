A dog allergic to dog food enjoys a meal of specially-cooked food every day - costing his doting owner thousands.

French Bulldog Blake is fed chicken, sweet potatoes, salmon and brown rice every day because of his intolerance to ordinary dog food.

Owner Preeti Young, who is a professional model, eats her meals at the same time as Blake and often prepares the same meal for them both - at a cost of £1,800 per year on food for the allergic hound.

Cute: Blake comes up in a rash if he eats normal dog food so owner Preeti cooks him special meals every day

Blake comes out in a rash if he eats tinned or dry food so Preeti, 24, makes him cooked meals.

She said: 'He loves it.

'I coordinate our meals and make his dinner at the same time as mine.

'Ever since I put him on human food he has been fine and had no problems. My vet said it’s fine.'

Blake even joins Preeti and her twin sister Priya at the dinner table for meals.

She spends £5 a day on Blake’s special diet and even makes him a packed lunch if he has to go out.

'It is way more expensive that buying dog food. A big bag would last ages, but I buy fresh chicken, sweet potatoes and all his other favourites.' She added.

'I probably spend about £10,000 a year on him. I am quite an extravagant person. Most people who know me would expect this kind of thing from me. It’s only the people that don’t know me that think it’s weird. My friends just laugh. It’s just the sort of person I am.

'I don’t mind spending that on him - he is worth it. I have to do it,' Preeti, from Brentford, west London, added. 'Everyone thinks I am a bit extreme with my dog. I adore him. If I have to go out I will cook his food and make him a little packed lunch.' 

Preeti discovered Blake’s dog food allergy when he was five-months old after a trip to the vets when he couldn’t stop scratching himself.

The 14 month old pup comes out in an itchy rash every time he goes near normal dog food.

He scratched himself so much once his skin became infected, leaving him with painful sores all over his body.

Tests by a dermatologist showed the canine was allergic to beef, lamb, cow's milk and even barley, so owner Preeti Young decided to test him on a diet of human food.

She explained: 'It was getting too much. It was pretty horrible when he was scratching all the time - it was quite distressing to see.

'I took him to the vets who ran blood tests which showed he had some allergies to beef, lamb, cow’s milk and barley so I cut all those things out of his diet and bought different dog foods but he was still scratching so I took him to a specialist dermatologist.

'They said his initial blood test was probably done a bit early and he hadn’t developed anti-bodies, so I just tried cooking for him one day.

'I researched it and read on the internet to try not feeding him dog food and it has worked wonders.'

Blake also enjoys Quorn sausages as part of his daily diet but is still happy to chew on a bone.

'I still buy him bones for his teeth and other dog treatments,' Pretti added.

'He is healthy and his coat is nice and shiny.

'He is much happier now and is very outgoing.'

Deputy veterinary director from the Dogs Trust Runa Hanaghan said the number of dogs with allergies is increasing.

She said: 'Dogs can get allergies from quite commons things that humans can get as well.

'Blake has quite a serious problem there. We are seeing more and more allergies in dogs but may be we are understanding them more as well. We are able to help more now with allergies in dogs and we will test for them.

'There are lots of different types of allergies.

'They aren’t simple cases they never are. Every individual dog is different and it’s important to make sure people take their dogs to the vet.'
