A couple have been arrested on suspicion of Syria-related terrorism offences at Heathrow Airport.

The man, 20, and woman,19, from Walsall, West Midlands were detained at around 10.30 on Tuesday night as they disembarked a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, police said.

They were held by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit.

Police said there was no risk to the safety of the flight and described the arrests as 'planned and intelligence led'.

West Midlands CTU added: 'Police are working hard with partner agencies and community groups to alert the public to the dangers of radicalisation and explain what help is available to those vulnerable to negative influences.

'We continue to urge people to contact us if they have any concerns that someone they know may be thinking of travelling to Syria. It is not safe and the advice is not to go for any reason.

'We understand there is a desire to help with the humanitarian crisis so we would encourage people to get involved with helping established charities who have experience of getting aid through to those in need.

'Anyone with any concerns can call us on 101.'

Two addresses in Walsall are being searched and the suspects are in custody in the West Midlands.

It comes less than a week after a 19-year-old man from Coventry was held by counter-terrorism officers at the same airport after arriving on a flight from Jordan.

The arrests came on the same day Home Secretary Theresa May  published a Counter-terrorism and Security Bill containing a range of new powers, including a legal requirement by schools, prisons and councils to put in place policies to stop would-be extremists being radicalised.
