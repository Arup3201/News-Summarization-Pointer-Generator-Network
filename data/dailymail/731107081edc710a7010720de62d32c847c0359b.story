Arsenal's Christmas party turned out to be a lavish musical production that included Alexis Sanchez on the piano and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain putting together his own boy band. 

The England youngster posted a picture of himself crooning with team-mates Theo Walcott, Aaron Ramsey, Kieran Gibbs, Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers at last week's festive do - with the caption: 'Boy band bits from the Christmas party'.

The all-British line-up resembles a modern day Rat Pack with all of the players wearing black tie - although Frank Sinatra and Co are unlikely to have been impressed by Gibbs' choice of jeans.

Also flexing his musical muscles last week was Sanchez who serenaded team-mate Lukas Podolski with a surprisingly impressive piano performance.  

The Chilean forward, who joined Arsenal in the summer from Barcelona, performed Richard Marx's 'Right Here Waiting' to Podolski, who then uploaded a video to social media site Instagram.

Dressed in an all-black suit, Sanchez looked as comfortable in front of a piano as he does on the pitch at the Emirates.

Alongside the video, Podolski wrote the message, 'Was great to be serenaded by my bro Alexis! #Christmas #Alexis #Poldi #Bro #multitalented #serenaded'.

The Arsenal squad enjoyed a lavish meal at their second Christmas party, with a number of first-team players posting pictures of their evening online.

The Gunners have had a stuttering start to this season's Premier League campaign and will finish the year in fifth place.

They face Southampton at St Mary's on New Year's Day, where three points can take them a step closer to the holy grail of a Champions League place.
