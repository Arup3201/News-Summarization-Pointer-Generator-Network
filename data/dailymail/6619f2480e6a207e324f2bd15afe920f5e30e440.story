Serious risk: Robert Edward Hind, 46, was reported missing on Wednesday

A dangerous and prolific sex offender who poses a serious risk to children is being hunted by police after absconding.

Robert Edward Hind, 46, was reported missing on Wednesday after he disappeared from an address in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.

He has since been recalled to prison, having breached the terms of his license.

Officers say Hind, who is also known as 'Dack', is a well-known sex attacker with a varied history of offences and presents a serious risk to the public, especially children.

They have urged the public not to approach him.

Detective Chief Inspector, Paul Jeffrey of Kirklees Police said: 'Hind was last seen on foot at around 9:00am in Dewsbury on Wednesday 11 December.

'We believe he remains in the West Yorkshire area and may have travelled to Huddersfield. He does however; have connections in the Lancashire area.

'Extensive enquiries have been conducted to trace him and these are continuing.

His details have also been circulated to other Forces.

'It is likely that he is using public transport to get around and I would urge members of the public to let us know immediately if they believe they have seen him.

'He is described as slim, around 5'8" tall, with brown hair, green eyes and has a distinctive scar on his neck.

'He was last seen wearing a dark hat and a green jacket with oriental style writing on the back.

'I am appealing for vigilance and support from the public and would ask that people do not approach him, but contact 999 immediately.

'Likewise, anyone with information as to his current whereabouts should call the police straight away.'
