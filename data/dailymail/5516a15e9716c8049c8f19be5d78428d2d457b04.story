A soldier transformed his violin into a fascinating diary of his life in the trenches and the battles he fought - by carving names and dates into the wood.

Ernest Johnson etched notes of where he had served into the back of the wooden instrument, which he used to to entertain troops during the First World War.

The violin, discovered in a plastic bag in a loft, has been fully restored and the poignant diary entries - which include names of infamous Great War battle fields - remain in place.

Ernest Johnson is pictured with his wife Jenny and their first two children Jim, four, and Hilda, two, taken in around 1916. The sapper transformed his violin into a fascinating diary of his life in the trenches

The entries include, dates and locations about where Ernest Johnson was serving as well as remarks about periods of leave

At the very top of the violin Ernest, who was 32 when he left for war, scratched: 'This violin is with Sapper E Johnson 143152' followed by his address in North Shields, Tyneside.

The first entry read: 'Left Buxton for France, 8/8/1915' and is followed by 20 place names and dates where he saw action including well known battle locations in France, Belgium and Italy.

The entries also contain remarks about periods of leave as well as a note about meeting King George on the front line at Messines, Belgium.

The last of the etchings reads: 'Finished with army 18-2-19'.

During his service Ernest used the violin to entertain his fellow front line soldiers with renditions of popular wartime tunes such as Roses of Picardy and Keep the Home Fires Burning.

He died in 1948 and the story of his violin became the stuff of family legend until his granddaughter Jan Evans started researching their family history in 2012.

To her surprise she discovered the violin still existed and had been kept in a bag in her cousin's loft for years.

The 64-year-old retired special needs teacher had the violin professionally restored and then embarked on lessons to learn how to play the very same war songs her grandfather would have played in the trenches.

The amazing tale has been told for the first time in a new book by Paul Atterbury, an expert on the Antiques Roadshow.

The book, called World War One in 100 Family Treasures, highlights stories that came to light in the making of the Antiques Roadshow's WWI centenary programmes but never made it to air.

Mrs Evans, from Kendal, Cumbria, said: 'My grandfather came from a musical family and so when he went off to war he took his violin with him.

Etchings: Some of the entries on the violin

At the very top of violin Ernest, who was 32 when he left for war, scratched: 'This violin is with Sapper E Johnson 143152' followed by his address in North Shields, Tyneside.

The first entry read: 'Left Buxton for France, 8/8/1915' and is followed by 20 place names and dates where he saw action including some of the most infamous battle locations in France, Belgium and Italy.

These include La Couture on August 14, 1915 in Northern France and then the battlefields of Neuve Chapelle on Noember 1, 1916 and and Richebourg on January 4 the following year. 

His travels in the army continue when on June 1, 1916 he was posted to Messines in Belgium, the site of a fearsome Western Front battle the following year.

It was here that he made a note about meeting King George on the front line. 

After 14 days leave, his diary indicates that he left France for Belgium on June 18 before being posted to the port city of Dunkirk on July 5 of that year.

In the autumn of that year, he marks on his violin that he is 'Home for today's leave' before adding 'Left Belgium for Italy'.

His diary entries list a number of Italian locations throughout 1917. 

The last of the etchings reads: 'Finished with army 18-2-19'.

'He would have played it to the soldiers in the trenches to entertain them and boost morale. As he travelled around he carved the names and dates of all the places he went to into the back of the violin.

'The writing starts off small because he didn't know how many places he would go to but gets larger as the war continued.

'I never met my grandfather but my grandmother used to tell me that when he came back from war he wasn't the same man she had married.

'He had seen such horrors that he had become quiet and withdrawn and spent his time playing his violin in his bedroom or in his shed at his allotment.

'The story of his violin was known within the family but when I found that it still existed I decided to have it restored and learn to play it.

Ernest Johnson, is pictured in the middle row, to the right of the man in the light jacket along with fellow soldiers. 

'I wanted to hear it for myself. It is very moving playing the violin but it has brought his memory back to life.' 

Ernest was 32 when enlisted in the Royal Engineers as a Sapper, leaving the family greengrocers in the hands of his wife Jenny and their two young children Jim and Hilda.

He survived four years of service during which he was deeply affected by the horrors of war, so much so that when he returned home to his family he was a different man.

He and Jenny had three more children - Walter, Jenny and Marjorie - but they were forced to close their shop as Britain struggled in the aftermath of war.

Ernest found occasional work in shipyards on the Tyne where he worked throughout the Second World War but the family was dealt another blow in 1940 when daughter Jenny died from meningitis aged 16.

Ernest died in 1948 aged 65 from a brain haemorrhage.
