Scott Brown delivered a devastating critique of Celtic’s domestic failings by accusing players of lacking fight and ‘hiding’ during yesterday’s historic home defeat to Hamilton.

Accies returned to the top of the table after their first competitive win at Parkhead since 1938, with scrutiny of Ronny Deila set to intensify after his team were booed for failing to respond to Ali Crawford’s strike early in the second half.

Celtic, who fell to sixth after their first home loss in the league since November 2012, are now six points off the pace – albeit with a game in hand. But while Deila insisted he was far from worried by league form, skipper Brown spared no-one in his post-match appraisal, declaring : ‘People were just hiding and it was disappointing to see and play in.

Celtic captain Scott Brown has slammed his teammates following their shock 1-0 defeat to Hamilton

‘I take my share of the blame as well in there. I’m not laying the blame at everybody else because we’re all in this together as a team.

‘We missed a few chances but at the end we didn’t deserve anything, to be perfectly honest. We didn’t play as well as we should have. We didn’t have enough movement and there weren’t enough people wanting the ball.’ 

Asked if he’d seen players ‘hiding’ before, Brown insisted: ‘Not as bad as today. It’s very disappointing. We tried to play but Hamilton pressed us high up the pitch and teams don’t do that at Celtic Park. We should be pressing teams high up the park - that’s what should be happening and it hasn’t happened.

‘I definitely understand the frustrations of the fans. It’s not just the fans - those are my own frustrations as well. Everyone in that dressing room should be devastated with that result.

‘It’s been almost two years since we lost a league game at home and we wanted to keep that run going - but we didn’t do ourselves justice at all.

‘I don’t know how we never got going. I would love to tell you because I would be a great manager if I knew that. At the end of the day, we weren’t good enough.

‘It looked like we had given up fighting, we were second to balls, we didn’t have enough upfront and it just wasn’t good to watch.’

A clearly angry Brown added: ‘I am devastated. I don’t do getting beat. I came to Celtic to win games and we’re not winning games and performing just now - and I don’t know why that is.

‘We’re just not doing it as a team and as individuals. We’re just waiting for somebody like Kris (Commons) to score a wonder goal from 30 yards and then we’ re all happy - but that doesn’t happen every week. We have to play and work hard.’

Asked if new manager Deila was getting the message across to players, many of whom are new arrivals at the club, the Scotland midfielder said: ‘He is getting there slowly.

‘It’s not about the manager. It’s also about the players. We need to deliver and, if we do that, then it gives the manager time as well.

‘Celtic are huge. I know myself that when I first came here I didn’t realise how big a club it is. Now the players have to realise this is a huge club. 

'You look at the fans and I can understand why they were booing. We don’t want that. We should be entertaining them and we aren’t doing that just now.’
