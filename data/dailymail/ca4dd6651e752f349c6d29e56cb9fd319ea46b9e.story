A lawyer representing Joan Rivers' daughter in her multimillion-dollar lawsuit against a New York City clinic claims that had doctors not been so busy fawning over the comedienne during a procedure on her throat, she would have been alive today.

Melissa Rivers said in a statement Monday that filing the lawsuit against her mother's doctors and Yorkville Endoscopy was one of the most difficult decisions she had to make.

'What ultimately guided me was my unwavering belief that no family should ever have to go through what my mother, Cooper and I have been through,' she said, referring to her son.

'The level of medical mismanagement, incompetency, disrespect and outrageous behavior is shocking and frankly, almost incomprehensible.'

She said her 81-year-old mother deserved better.

Miss Rivers, a comedienne who crashed the male-dominated realm of late-night talk shows and starred with her daughter on E! in Fashion Police, died September 4, 2014, a week after undergoing a routine surgery on her throat.

The city's medical examiner found that she died of brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during an endoscopy at Yorkville Endoscopy days earlier. Her death was classified as a therapeutic complication.

Melissa Rivers' lawsuit said doctors mishandled the endoscopy and performed another medical procedure called a laryngoscopy on her vocal cords without consent. The suit said the doctor left the operating room to avoid being caught.

The 47-year-old TV producer is also suing the doctors who treated Rivers prior to her death, claiming their 'negligence' and 'carelessness' triggered the star's fatal coma. 

'To put it mildly, we are not just disappointed by the acts and omissions leading to the death of Joan Rivers, but we are outraged by the lack of care and concern for Ms. Rivers on the part of her treating physicians and the endoscopy center where the treatment was rendered,' said her attorneys, Jeffrey Bloom and Ben Rubinowitz.

A federal investigation, ordered by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, found the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic made several errors, including failing to keep proper medication records and snapping cell phone photos of Rivers while she was unconscious in the operating room.

'Had the doctors acted as physicians for Joan Rivers instead of groupies, Joan Rivers would have been doing Fashion Police last week,' said Jeffrey Bloom.

The probe into the clinic also found the Manhattan clinic failed to get informed consent for every procedure performed and failed to record Rivers' weight before the administration of sedation medication.

Joan Rivers, who rose to fame on The Tonight Show, died of brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during what was meant to be a simple endoscopy and throat exam at the clinic.

In the lawsuit, her daughter alleges that doctors did not only carry out those procedures, but also conducted an unauthorized exam of her vocal chords and windpipe, leading to a laryngospasm. 

During the spasm, Rivers's throat seized up and deprived her brain of oxygen so she could not expel carbon dioxide from her lungs, the suit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday, states.

But despite the star's vital signs showing clear symptoms of distress, doctors decided to continue with the laryngoscopy, causing Rivers to ultimately suffer a heart attack and irreversible brain damage, the court documents state.

The suit goes on to claim that although doctors tried to revive the comedian for around 20 minutes, no one performed a trachetomy to open up her airways by cutting into her trachea, the New York Daily News reported.  

Instead, Rivers was rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital in a coma, where she was put on life support. However, she never regained consciousness and passed away a week later.

The complaint names five individual doctors - as well as the clinic on East 93rd Street - as defendants.

Accused: One of the doctors the suit refers to is River's private doctor, ENT specialist Gwen Korovin (right), who 'was permitted to do an unauthorized biopsy on Rivers by medical director, Lawrence Cohen (left)'

One of the doctors it refers to is River's private doctor, celebrity ENT specialist Gwen Korovin, who was 'permitted to do the unauthorized biopsy by the clinic's medical director, Lawrence Cohen'.

At the time, Korovin wasn't cleared to work at the clinic, it states, adding that Cohen 'failed to mention' the procedures carried out by by the doctor and even the fact that she was in the room. 

Melissa Rivers' lawsuit alleges that during the fateful medical procedure on her mother, Rivers' doctors brushed off concerns voiced by anesthesiologist Renuka Bankulla, who noticed 'incredible edema,' or swelling, in her throat.

Court documents state that when Bankulla suggested taking a picture of the swelling, the lead doctor, Lawrence Cohen, overruled her, calling the anesthesiologist 'paranoid' and a 'curious cat.'

The medical team proceeded with the endoscopy, even as Rivers' vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, oxygen level and heart rate - all dropped and the levels of carbon dioxide in her blood spiked, according to the lawsuit.

As Rivers' condition deteriorated, her doctors jumped into action trying to revive her, but according to the lawsuit, they failed to give her a muscle relaxant to open up her throat, nor did they perform a potentially life-saving tracheotomy.

Instead, the medics unsuccessfully tried to save their famous patient with chest compressions, intubation and a hand pump for her lungs.

About 17 minutes later, the anesthesiologist asked for a tracheotomy kit, but it went unused, the suit states.

The lawsuit claims that Gwen Korovin could have performed an emergency tracheotomy, but she had left the room. 

Experts told the Post that Melissa could win millions of dollars in the suit because her mother was still making good money from stand-up gigs, books and TV shows in the weeks before her death.

Indeed, the comedian performed at a Manhattan club the night before she fell into a coma. She had arranged the throat procedure because her voice had turned raspy and she did not know the cause.

The lawsuit comes just two weeks after it was revealed that Yorkville Endoscopy has lost its federal accreditation and will stop receiving funds at the end of January.

In a letter sent to the clinic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the clinic it no longer meets their conditions for coverage after failing to identify Rivers's deteriorating vital signs.

'Therefore, CMS is terminating the Medicare Health Benefits Agreement between Yorkville Endoscopy and the Secretary, effective January 31, 2015,' it said on January 12.

'As of January 31, 2015 Yorkville Endoscopy will no longer be eligible to receive federal funds for services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.'

Despite those losses, the clinic later issued a statement  indicating its intention to remain viable.

'Yorkville Endoscopy LLC does not intend to cease operations. Yorkville is hoping to cooperate with regulators to have the recent decision reversed or modified,' the clinic told ABC News.

Yorkville Endoscopy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AP.
