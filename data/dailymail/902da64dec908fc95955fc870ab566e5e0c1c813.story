Argentina legend Diego Maradona has revealed that he is in line to become the next coach of Venezuela.

And if the 1986 World Cup winner does get the job then he will hope to guide the only South American country never to qualify for the World Cup to the 2018 tournament in Russia.

Venezuela have been without a coach since Cesar Farias quit in November following the team's failure to make it to Brazil.

The Vinotinto - so called because of their burgundy-coloured kit - are yet to name a new manager but Maradona claims he is in the frame alongside some Venezuelan club team bosses.

Maradona told regional television network Telesur: 'I look for serious projects... and think that yes, if it's with security, then maybe.'

The 53-year-old is renowned for his leftist politics and he has long been courted by Venezuela's socialist government, and in particular their President Nicolas Maduro.

The former Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla and Boca Juniors forward plans to meet Maduro after the World Cup finishes in Brazil.

Maradona, who scored 34 goals in 91 internationals for Argentina, said: 'We plan to talk a bit about everything, including the team.'

Speculation linking Maradona with the Venezuela post surfaced last week in the South American country.

Venezuela's late President, Hugo Chavez, was a close friend of Maradona.

Maradona previously managed Argentina and Al Wasl.
