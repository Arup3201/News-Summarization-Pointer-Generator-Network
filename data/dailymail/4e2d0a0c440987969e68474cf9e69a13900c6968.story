A Florida drug ring that employed a voodoo priest among its numerous operatives was busted in a major $2 million meth shakedown dubbed Operation Hoodoo Voodoo, police announced Wednesday.

Polk County sheriffs intercepted a 44lb shipment at a truck stop on Tuesday despite the magical soothsayer's insistence that everything was going to be fine that day.

The major police victory led to 16 arrests and the dismantling of a drug pipeline that stretched from Mexico through Southern California, Las Vegas, Atlanta and finally Florida.

Haul: Weapons and drugs were seized in one of the largest busts carried out in Florida

During the bust more than 100 firearms including assault rifles, a grenade launcher, and bullet proof vests were seized.

'They had everything you can imagine - just all manner of weapons,' sheriff's spokeswoman Donna Woods said.

'It’s about drugs and money and 
guns,' Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told BayNews9. 'This is the kind 
of firearms that our special agents and our detectives and our deputies 
face everyday as we fight this war on drugs.'

The 16 arrested were 
some of the organization's 25 distributors, couriers and dealers reports
 the Orlando Sentinel.

The ring's leader Javier 'El Don' Flores, remained at large but Ma Concepcion Lopez, who is alleged to have been the ring's other leader, was arrested.

The 38-year-old, who had sneaked back across the border after being deported to Mexico in 2009, was among those in the ring to have allegedly consulted the voodoo priest.

Lopez lived with Luis Villafuerte-Rojas, another suspected ring leader who was arrested at a truck stop when the shipment arrived by truck from California.

The name and further details about the voodoo consultant have not been released.

El Don, who is still on the run, supervised the transcontinental operation from his Southern California home. It's also where he presumably got the advice
 from his voodoo priest that led to his organization's undoing.

Foresight: The arrests came on the day the group's voodoo priest told them everything was going to be fine

Risky: Police say the guns that were seized show the dangers officers face in the war on drugs

According to the wire taps, leaders of the ring sought the unnamed voodoo man's counsel in February after $200,000 was seized from the group by investigators.

'They wanted to know if it was OK to continue,' Woods told the Sentinel. 'The priest advised them everything's OK. Just lay low for a couple of weeks. It's not the police. It's someone inside the organization.'

The priest was wrong, however, and the continued efforts of police - helped by the misplaced confidence of their targets - allowed for Tuesday's huge haul.

Wire taps of the ringleaders, which included conversations with the priest, helped, too.

'We hoodoo the voodoo man,' said Judd, explaining the operation's name. 'The day we served all the search warrants and made all the arrests, he told them "don’t worry about it, everything is fine".'

Far reaching: The drug ring ran a pipeline of meth from Mexico through Southern California, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Florida

'Well I agree with the voodoo man, everything is fine. Polk County is safe and there’s a lot of drugs not in central Florida.”

When police seiged a Polk County homebase, they found among the firearms AR-15s, AK-47, grenade launcher, bulletproof body armor, and thousands of rounds of ammo.

'Folks, that's more long arms than most police departments have in the U.S.,' DEA Special Agent Mark Trouville told WFTV.

Two children were taken from the home, as well.

'They're victims,' said Judd. 'We had to call DCF in order to turn the children over to the state, because all over their relatives were either arrested or implicated in this drug operation.'
