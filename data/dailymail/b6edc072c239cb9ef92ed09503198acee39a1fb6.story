Sharon Osbourne made a spectacular return to her post as an X factor judge on Saturday night as the new season of the reality show kicked off.

The 60-year-old's refreshing tell-it-like-it-is attitude and warm humour has made her a firm favorite across the nation, and she has become a fashion icon for older women. 

Though she has never been shy about her various cosmetic surgery procedures, fans were shocked at Sharon's appearance on Saturday night, with her slightly 'stretched' look causing some to question whether she has gone too far.

Sharon's face seemed puffy and swollen at times during the first two X factor episodes of the new season

Sharon returned to the X factor judging panel, much to the delight of her fans, but her face was noticeably different than the last time she sat alongside Gary and Louis

Sharon attracted attention when she was pictured leaving her New York hotel on August 6 this year looking swollen

In 2012, the talent show judge vowed not to undergo any further cosmetic surgery following numerous health issues, including a double mastectomy

Sharon, who appeared alongside other judges Louis Walsh, 61, Gary Barlow, 42 and Nicole Scherzinger, 35, appeared puffy and her eyes had taken on a slightly cat-like look.

Last year, Sharon spoke about how she had taken the decision to not have anymore cosmetic surgery after recovering from colon cancer and undergoing a double mastectomy.

Speaking on US chat show The Talk in 2012, Sharon said: 'No more, because I have been looking at pictures of myself recently since I started to lose weight.

'And in a lot of shots, my face looks plastic and at certain angles I was like, 'Oh, dear. Oh, I should never have done that. Oh, that's a bad one.' So I'm like, 'No more. No more abuse.''

The media personality and wife of Ozzy Osbourne has previously admitted having spent an eye-watering £300,000 on plastic surgery, including a gastric band (which resulted in her dropping over 100lbs), eye lift, facelift, tummy tuck, Botox, a full facelift, abdominoplasty, and breast lift.

On her own chat show in 2006, Sharon introduced her plastic surgeon Dr. Leslie Stevens to talk about her various procedures, and even had Boxtox injected live in front of the studio audience.

'I think that Botox is one of the best things to be created in plastic surgery,' Sharon gushed.

Despite admitting that she had to have all the procedures she had undergone listed off camera because they were too numerous to remember, Sharon even booked in for another breast lift and upper arm procedure while on air.

After surviving colon cancer in 2004, the reality show The Osbourne's was becoming a huge success and Sharon was winning over the hearts of women the world over for her no-nonsense attitude

The proud cosmetic surgery aficionado says: 'I'm the only person, who goes to the cosmetic surgeons for surgery, who comes out and I don't have a scarf over their face when the paparazzi are there. I'm like "Hi!"'

As we age, our faces begin to show the effects of gravity, sun exposure and years of facial muscle movement, such as smiling, chewing and squinting.

The underlying tissues that keep our skin looking youthful and plumped up begin to break down, often leaving laugh lines, smile lines, crow’s feet or facial creases over the areas where this muscle movement occurs.

Soft-tissue fillers can help fill in these lines and creases, temporarily restoring a smoother, more youthful-looking appearance. When injected beneath the skin, these fillers plump up creased and sunken areas of the face.

They can also be used for lip enhancement and to add fullness to the cheeks and for a chin implant.

Injectable fillers are primarily used to improve the appearance of the skin’s texture. They can help fill out deep facial wrinkles, creases and furrows, “sunken” cheeks, skin depressions and some types of scars.

They can also be used to add a fuller, more sensuous look to the lips and for lip enhancement.

Dr. Roberto Viel of the London Centre of Aesthetic Surgery

While many have applauded her openness around cosmetic surgery, Sharon's recent appearance indicated she may have gone too far.

Dr. Roberto Viel of the London Centre of Aesthetic Surgery said: 'I think this puffiness and slight lopsided facial expression comes from the excess use of filler to plump the face and fill out the lips.

'The lips especially have been overfilled - something Sharon hasn't tampered with too much in the past and which - in my opinion - is a mistake here.

'However this is a non-permanent procedure so should go down in the next few weeks.

'Filler can be highly effective when used subtly to restore some loss of volume to the face, correcting hollow sunken cheeks and restoring a more youthful radiance; something I felt Sharon understood and kept well balanced in the past. 

'However, fillers can also look dreadful when used in excess, needing to be administered by an expert who knows how to balance the natural contours of the face.

'Surgery, both invasive and non invasive, is an art form, and should be used only to enhance one’s natural features.'
