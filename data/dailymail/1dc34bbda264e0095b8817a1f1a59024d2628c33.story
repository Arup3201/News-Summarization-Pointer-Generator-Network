Discipline: Boris Johnson has backed Labour MP David Lammy's call for a rethink on smacking laws

Boris Johnson has backed calls for parents to be allowed to smack their children to instil discipline.

The Mayor of London spoke after a senior Labour MP blamed his party’s partial ban on smacking children for last August’s riots.

Former education minister David Lammy called for a return to Victorian laws on discipline, saying working-class parents needed to be able to use corporal punishment to deter unruly children from joining gangs and wielding knives.

He claimed parents were ‘no longer sovereign in their own homes’ and feared that  social workers would take their children away if they chastised them.

Labour’s 2004 law did not completely ban smacking,  but said a smack should cause no more than a reddening of the skin.

Last night Mr Johnson supported Mr Lammy, saying the current law was ‘confusing’, meaning that parents do not know how far they can go in terms of smacking their children.

‘People do feel anxious about imposing discipline on their children, whether  the law will support them,’ he told the Pienaar’s Politics programme on BBC Radio 5 Live.

‘I think there ought to be some confirmation that the benefit of the doubt will always be given to parents in these matters and they should be seen as the natural figures of authority in this respect.

'Obviously you don’t want to have a licence for physical abuse or for violence and that’s very important.’

The Mayor said he believed he had the support of Education Secretary Michael Gove.

‘I know that people will have their own views, but let  me just say on the issue that’s been raised a lot of times with me; the issue of are you allowed to chastise, are you allowed to impose discipline?’

Aftermath: David Lammy inspects riot damage in Tottenham last summer. He wants the ban on smacking children overturned to help prevent a repeat of the mass disturbances

Lack of discipline: Mr Lammy said many of his constituents had told him the outbreaks of nihilistic violence that characterised the riots had been down to their inability to properly chastise their children

Mr Lammy, MP for Tottenham, where 
last year’s riots started, said: ‘Many of my constituents blamed the 
Labour government afterwards, saying: “You guys stopped us being able to
smack our children”.

‘These
parents are scared to smack their children and paranoid that social 
workers will get involved and take their children away.’

Mr
Lammy said middle-class families can handle rebellious children by 
putting them in tennis classes or private schools – options not open to 
poorer parents.

Parents in 
Tottenham had to ‘raise children on the 15th floor of a tower block with
knives, gangs and the dangers of violent crime just outside the 
window’, he said.

‘We should return to the law as  it existed for 150 years  before it was changed in 2004,’ he said.

‘The law at that time left judges to determine if a parent had used reasonable chastisement.

‘Under the new arrangements, it is left to social workers.

‘We
should allow 99 per cent of parents to determine how to help their 
children understand boundaries and learn right from wrong.’

Mr
Lammy said he had smacked his sons, aged three and five, ‘but it 
doesn’t happen very often – usually when they are in danger’.
