Jose Mourinho took a thinly-veiled swipe at Arsene Wenger ahead of Chelsea's meeting with Arsenal on Saturday.

Wenger celebrates his 1,000th match in charge at Stamford Bridge but Mourinho said: 'The tribute is to say that any one of us, we'd love to have the same privilege with our clubs.

'I admire Wenger and I admire Arsenal, a club that stands by their manager in bad moments - of which there were quite a lot.'

When asked if he regrets his specialist in failure comment about Wenger, the Chelsea manager replied: 'Ask him does he regret comment he made... so I can't answer.'

After he was pushed, Mourinho replied: 'Next question'.

Mourinho claims all the other clubs in the Champions League would love to draw Chelsea in the quarter finals.

Chelsea beat Galatasaray in the last round but their manager classes them as outsiders in the last eight.

Mourinho said: 'Sometimes in the quarter-finals you have an odd side, a team people thought might not be there but that's not the case. We're calm because we know what to expect.Â 

'All the big teams are there, the teams of the moment and the teams with history.

'I think all of the teams want us. Because Chelsea are the outsiders of the group, us and Manchester United. You have last season's winner and runner-up, the two Spanish giants, Atletico, a great side over the last two seasons and Paris with all they represent.'

Mourinho is set to appeal against his FA charge for improper conduct after he was sent off against Aston Villa last weekend.

'I don't accept the charges. For you it is enough to know that for obvious reasons I don't accept the charges.'
