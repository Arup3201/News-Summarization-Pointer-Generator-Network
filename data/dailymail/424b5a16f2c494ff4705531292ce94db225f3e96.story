A 16-year-old schoolgirl who died after being strangled with a scarf was five months pregnant, it was revealed today.

Kayleigh Palmer, of Bishops Cleeve, Gloucestershire - who died on Saturday after being found last Wednesday with the scarf around her neck - was thrilled to be expecting a baby, friends said.

Before her death her boyfriend Aston Robinson, 18, was charged with attempted murder - and he was remanded in custody last Friday. It is not yet clear whether he will be charged with her murder.

One of Kayleigh’s friends said: ‘It 
wasn’t just her that died - she had a new life inside her and she was so
 looking forward to giving birth and being a mum. It’s a double tragedy 
for her and her family.’

The
 revelation came as her family spoke out for the first time since her death today, praising the 'very loving' teenager who 'had a great sense of humour' and 'lit up every room she entered'.

Kayleigh's mother Helen Bage said: ‘Kay was my whole
world. We had a strong relationship filled with love and laughter. Our bond was
so strong we were best friends.

‘Kay was so beautiful inside and out. She was very loving
towards family and friends and always remained loyal to us all.

‘You always knew when Kay was around because she had the
most wicked sense of humour and always made people laugh. Her personality lit
up every room she entered.’

And her father Dean Palmer said: ‘Kay was my beautiful
daughter. She was great company and had a great sense of humour. I was the
first to hold her and I'm devastated she won't ever get the chance to hold her
own baby.’

Meanwhile Kayleigh's grandparents Michael and Carole Bage
said: ‘From the moment our grand-daughter Kay was born, we were privileged to
be a part of her life.

‘We gave her our unconditional love and in return she gave
us so much more. Both she and her friends filled our home for many years with
fun and laughter but sadly this can be no longer.

‘Thankfully, nothing is more precious than all the memories
we hold dear of our beautiful Kay who was so very special to us. We loved you
so much Kay and you will always be in our hearts.’

Gloucestershire Constabulary confirmed she had been pregnant in a statement, saying they were looking at whether to bring further charges ‘in light of Kayleigh-Anne's death and the death of her unborn child following the assault’.

Rob Broadbridge, Kayleigh’s headmaster at Cleeve 
School, praised the Year 11 student for her ‘determination, kindness and
 vibrant personality’.

He 
added: ‘We’re deeply saddened and shocked by the tragic death of 
Kayleigh Palmer [and] our thoughts and condolences are with her family, 
friends and all who knew her at this very sad time.’

Dozens
 of floral tributes have been left outside the school, which was 
unlocked at the weekend so friends and fellow pupils could go to 
remember her, and some have been posting messages online.

Friend
 Jodie Preedy, 16, said: ‘Kay was a beautiful girl. Words can’t describe
 how devastated I am. My thoughts go out to her family and friends at 
this sad time.

‘She was so innocent and didn’t deserve any of this. She will be dearly missed.’

Another
 of her school friends, who did not want to be named, said: ‘None of us 
can believe it. She had so much to live for and always had a smile on 
her face.

‘Everybody loved 
Kay and we are all in shock that she has gone. But we will never forget 
her. Everyone has been sharing memories of her and that has helped 
everyone.

‘We just can’t 
believe what has happened. You never expect it to be someone you know 
and care about. She was just so young and had so much ahead of her.’

Kayleigh would have been due to sit her GCSEs exams later this year.

Chairman
 of Bishop’s Cleeve Parish Council, Peter Lightfoot, said: ‘We are all 
shocked that something like this can happen and want to express our 
sympathy to her friends, family and the school at what is a really 
difficult time.

Messages and floral tributes for the tragic teen have been left at the pupil's school

One of the many messages left for Kayleigh, which reads: 'Thank you for being one of the kindest most friendly people. History won't be the same without you'

‘It is 
particularly tragic when something like this happens to someone so 
young, who has their whole life ahead of them. The school is a really 
important part of the community for the council and we are thinking of 
them at this difficult time.’
