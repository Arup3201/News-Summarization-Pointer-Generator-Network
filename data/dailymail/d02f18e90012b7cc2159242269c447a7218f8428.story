Jack White has spoken out following widespread criticism over the recently revealed concert rider that appears to show the guitarist's extreme dislike for bananas and love of guacamole.

The former White Stripes front man's contends that not only was that guacamole recipe on the list of demands not his own, but someone in his band can't have bananas around due to an allergy.

An exasperated White took to his website to clear up the matter once and for all with a letter he posted Sunday explaining the very particular demands.

No diva: Jack White's (above) backstage demands for a performance at the University of Oklahoma were published by the student newspaper but on Sunday the musician tried to explain the controversy away

As for the bananas ban: 'did it occur to anyone someone on the tour might have an allergy to them?' asks White

'First off, this is none of your business, but i have no specific demands in my dressing room. i know i could ask for lots of things but i actually don't ask for ANYTHING,' he writes.

White says the guacamole recipe is an 'inside joke' between his tour manager and the local promoters to see 'who can make it the best.' 

He says the recipe could never be his because he 'can’t even make kool aid let alone cook any real food.' 

As for the banana ban, 'did it occur to anyone someone on the tour might have an allergy to them?' demands White.

'I know it’s a fun thing for people to try to turn me into a jerk and a diva, but in this case it’s pretty ridiculous,' he writes.

The 'drama,' as White calls it, began when the much admired American musician made an appearance at University of Oklahoma this week and, after getting their hands on his contract for the evening, the  student newspaper decided to let the world know all of White's backstage demands.

It turns out however, that White may be one of the easiest stars ever when it comes to demands, asking for little and even skipping out on alcohol all together, but stressing one thing above all - that his homemade guacamole recipe is made just how he likes it.

That and that there be no bananas anywhere in the building. 

The artist (seen above at the Oklahoma performance) asked for very little, and no alcohol, but did demand his guacamole be made just how he likes it and wrote out the recipe

The Oklahoma Daily seemed less interested in then guacamole than in White was being paid that evening though, writing; 'White in the contract is guaranteed $80,000 versus the right to receive 90 percent of the amount earned from ticket sales, which have a net potential of a little over $147,000.'

They did however attach the contract, which breaks down how White's guacamole is made.

It starts with 8 'large, ripe Haas avocados' which are cut in chunks and combined with four 'vine-ripened tomatoes' diced, half of a chopped yellow onion, a bunch of chopped cilantro, four Serrano peppers that are both 'de-veined and chopped' and some salt and pepper to taste.

This then gets gently mixed, so as not to mush up the avocados, and then covered with the avocado pits and the juice of half of a lime so the mixture does not brown.

White suggests that it be made early, but not too early, and tossed in the refrigerator.

The rider also states this is a 'no banana tour,' and then adds; 'We don't want to see bananas anywhere in the building.' 

Speaking of White, he was none too happy to have his rider go public, and a member of his team let it be known in a letter on his website. 

It said: 'The most important function of a rider is that it lays out optimal technical specifications to ensure the audience has the best experience possible. For that, Jack hires a team of very qualified touring professionals who write the rider and attempt to execute a professional and pleasant experience for all involved.'

The letter the said; 'Part of that is making sure that the tour personnel of about 30 people plus the local venue staff are fed. Contrary to what some believe, Jack doesn’t write the rider nor make demands about his favorite snacks that must be in his dressing room.'

Most importantly however, this letter makes one thing clear above all else.

'We recommend you try Lalo’s guacamole recipe,' says the author. 

'It’s delicious.'
