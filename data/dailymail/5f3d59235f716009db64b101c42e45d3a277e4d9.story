Anthropologie has taken the term ‘glamping’ to the next level by selling a tent that costs more than many luxury hotel suites.

The brand’s $8,998 Altair tent measures approximately 120 square feet and is lined in a star-embroidered fabric.

The item, which the retailer is calling a 'canvas cottage', comes without floor coverings, requires self-assembly, and costs $300 to ship.

A look inside: The tent is lined in orange, star-embroidered fabric but does not come with floor coverings or furniture

Anthropologie's site recommends that shoppers place their new tent, ‘poolside, beachside, or right-smack in the middle of a meadow.’

The one-room tent seems to be for serious glampers only. It costs nearly three times more the $3,170 Premiere Park Suite at New City’s Ritz Carlton Central Park hotel – which comes fully-furnished and is temperature-controlled.

A comparable room at The Plaza costs $3,639 per night.

The
 tent only comes in a single color offering: natural canvas exteriors 
that are lined in orange, gold-embroidered fabric. The structure has 
pin-up window coverings and a large, non-retractable awning.

It is the most expensive product offering in the retailer’s ‘garden and outdoor’ e-shop.

A similarly-sized tent by L.L. Bean costs just $389 and includes floor coverings.

For sale online: Shoppers can buy the tent online, but must pay $300 to have it shipped

While Anthropologie is known for its relatively reasonably-priced clothes, the company has been known to hawk incredibly expensive housewares.

Presently, it is also selling a $4,800 bathtub that has been ‘smashed’ by artist Pierre Malbec. Rather than use the tub for its true function, Anthropologie recommends that shoppers hang it on their wall to add ‘distressed interest’ to their home.
