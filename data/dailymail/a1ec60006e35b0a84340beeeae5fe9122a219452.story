A toddler was so badly mauled in a vicious dog attack that her tongue was left poking through a gaping hole in her cheek.

But the owner of the Labrador collie, which savagely clamped its jaws around Lucy Harris' face, was fined just £250.

The two-year-old was helping her mother Heidi, 26, clean the family car when the dog cross charged her and attacked her on July 22.

Brutal: Lucy Harris, 2, is pictured left with her open wounds and right, following 30 stitches to her face, after the savage dog attack which left her tongue poking through a hole in her cheek

Distraught Mrs Harris rushed to Lucy's aid and managed to prize the youngster from the animal's jaws as it pinned the helpless girl down to the ground.

Lucy’s dad Gary Barratt, 43, rushed her 
to hospital after he checked her bloodied face and shockingly found her 
tongue sticking out of a hole in her cheek.

Medics needed more than 30 stitches to stop the bleeding and piece the fragile toddler's face back together.

But there was nothing doctors could do to stop the permanent scar now etched on her cheek.

Her family said Lucy has been deeply traumatised by the attack, which has shattered her confidence and made her terrified of strangers and any animals she sees.

They believe Lucy would have died if her mum hadn’t been there to rescue her from the dog’s snapping jaws.

The animal, called Dobbie, had belonged to the family’s neighbour Margaret Wright who had been saying goodbye to a friend when the creature dashed out her front door.

Wright, who lives a few doors away, claimed her pet was not violent - and said the animal only bit the girl because she touched his sore ear.

Wright, 60, admitted to her dog being out of control in a public place and could have faced up to two years behind bars, or a fine running into thousands of pounds.

But instead she was ordered her to pay just £250 in compensation and £45 legal costs following a hearing at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Friday.

Lucy's parents said the toddler is now a 'shadow of her former self' and suffers trauma after the attack

The young girl’s family today said they felt 'sickened' by the soft sentence that they said won’t stop other dangerous dog owners letting their dogs run wild.

Mother-of-three Heidi, who lives in Cambridge, said: 'The attack was so horrific.

'It had been a lovely day we were outside cleaning the car. I then heard this almighty scream and saw the dog biting my daughters face.

'She had a chunk of flesh torn from her face it was the worst thing I have ever seen

'She has not been the same since the attack, she gets very shy and seems to have no confidence and what’s more she might have permanent scarring on her face.

'So when the court ruled we were just to get £250 I was sickened.

'My little girl could have died if I had not intervened. This is a hugely traumatic moment in her life but it seems as though that doesn’t really matter it the eyes of the court.

'She may need further surgery or counseling in the future and who is supposed to pay for that?

'This isn’t sending out the right message to the owners of potentially dangerous dogs.'

Immediately
after the attack,  Lucy was rushed to Addenbrooke’s hospital by her 
parents where she underwent two hours of emergency surgery and was kept 
in for three days.

Her parents say the poor youngster is now a 'shadow of her former self' and suffers psychological trauma following the attack.

Lucy is also terrified of all animals, struggles at nursery school and regularly points to her face saying 'Naughty Dobbie'.

Her furious dad Gary, a window cleaner, said: 'I have never seen anything like it.

'There was blood everywhere. I was stunned but also furious - I could have killed that dog.

'The attack was absolutely atrocious she is my little girl and she was savagely attacked by this dog.

'And it felt like the courts were just rubbing salt into our wounds when the owner of the creature was just ordered to pay £250.

'Is my daughters well-being worth just £250? It is an absolute joke. Lucy has just started nursery and all the kids are asking what has happened to her face.

'I hope the scar will fade away but when I look at her my heart drops.'

During the court hearing on Friday Yetunde Fawehinmi, prosecuting, said: 'The girl’s mother saw her daughter had drifted away and the next she heard was screaming.

'She saw the dog attacking the child and biting her face.'

She added: 'The child wouldn’t stop screaming so they called for an ambulance and were taken to hospital.'

Jim Dignan, defending, said Wright was a responsible dog owner and this attack came out of the blue.

He said: 'My client said the dog would not bite a child unless it had a reason to do so.

'The dog had a sore ear and if the child touched the dog’s ear then the dog may have reacted to that with a bite.'

Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, owners of dogs found to be out of control can be sent to prison for up to six months and/or fined.

Owners whose pets harm someone can be sent to prison for up to two years and/or fined up to 175 per cent of weekly earnings. The dog was put down after the attack.
