Chelsea will probably know by now that they called it wrong. They were on trial as much as Christian Eriksen when one of Europe’s most hyped young talents turned up in Cobham as a 14-year-old for the first of two visits.

It might just sting Jose Mourinho on Sunday that neither side quite fancied the other, Chelsea thinking the boy ‘too weak’, to quote the player’s father, and Eriksen himself ruling that the club’s academy set-up was not as embracing or enticing as that offered by Ajax.

What an intriguing quirk of fate that scrawny Eriksen grew into a player more than capable of dictating how this Capital One Cup final will be won.

‘England was not my first choice at that age,’ Eriksen admitted this week, recalling the trips from Odense to London, first at 14 and then 15 for games against Millwall and West Ham.

‘I enjoyed myself but it was too big a step at that time. In England you can’t enter the training ground without permission whereas in Denmark you are free to go in. Ajax was a lot closer to home and it meant my mum could come over for my first month. It was an easy decision.’

He signed for Ajax at 16 and joined Tottenham as an £11million player in 2013. In the wider scheme of the club’s spending in recent years, he might just be the best of the lot.

He is the playmaker in the tight spaces, an attacking midfielder with enough sense of purpose that he has scored 16 goals in 51 Premier League games. As Spurs flopped out of Europe on Thursday, Eriksen still managed to look good.

If Harry Kane is to follow Eriksen in succeeding in a second season, he will need some of the latter’s resistance to expectations. As a talented Dane born to an ambitious father in Laudrup country, pressure is something Eriksen had to deal with from the start.

That was vividly illustrated last October when, following a defeat for Denmark against Portugal, the national manager Morten Olsen hammered Eriksen in the press. The gist was that Eriksen, 22 then, ought to be controlling a game featuring Cristiano Ronaldo.

‘He said it publicly and also told me personally,’ Eriksen said. ‘Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. I think it helped and it didn’t hurt. I’ve grown up with that. My dad was a coach for me when I was seven to 13. He was a footballer as well, so he knew what he wanted. When I had a bad game, he would tell me to do better.

‘There were times when I closed my door pretty hard after I spoke to him. And then the day after, it’s a new day. It’s football. I’ve learned to live with pressure. In the Danish newspapers the comparisons were with (Michael) Laudrup, so of course that started early.’

Pressure is a fascinating topic at Tottenham. Mauricio Pochettino has spoken frequently of the need to develop a winning mentality, given the team’s dreadful run of results against the bigger clubs.

The test for Kane will also come from maintaining what has been a sensational season. Eriksen said: ‘What Harry’s doing is impressive. But again, you always have the pressure from outside. Now if he doesn’t score he will feel it straight away. But Harry is a worker as well. He works for the team. He is not a striker who waits for the ball.’

The challenge now is for Tottenham’s two leading outfield forces to take on a fresher, stronger Chelsea side. The 5-3 home win over Mourinho’s side in January is still fresh in the mind. ‘We showed that we can beat them,’ Eriksen said.

Now Eriksen must show Chelsea what they might have won.
