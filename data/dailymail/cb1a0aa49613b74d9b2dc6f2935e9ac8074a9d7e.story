NASCAR racer Brad Keselowski drove right into the heart of the Twitterati during Monday's delayed Daytona 500 by tweeting from his car and picking up over 100,000 Twitter followers in the process.

Before the race, Keselowski had about 
65,000 followers on the social networking site. About 24 hours later, he
had more than 212,000.

He started by posting a photo of his view of the incident where a jet-dryer truck that erupted in a fireball after it was hit by driver Juan Pablo Montoya with 40 laps remaining.

Trailblazer: Keselowski's interactive approach to the race was not only a hit with the thousands of fans who followed his tweets but some of his rivals

The 28-year-old tweeted quick 
reactions to incidents in the race and shared his phone with 
fellow drivers during the two-hour break as the track was cleared of the
truck.

'Nothing we could do there,' he posted. 'Never saw the wreck till we were windshield deep.'

He also interacted with fans and posted various musings about the delayed race.

The Dodge driver took advantage of several breaks in the race to keep his followers updated.

After a brief lapse in tweets, he told a concerned fan: 'Still here bs-ing w other drivers'.

Most
professional sports ban competitors from tweeting during events but 
NASCAR, keen to make ground in social media, has taken a more lenient 
attitude.

Keselowski's interactive approach was not only a hit with the thousands of fans who followed his tweets but his rivals also approved.

'Time to get back racing, thank you for following!,' Keselowski wrote.

'That's how Brad is. That's what he makes and what he enjoys,' runner up Dale Earnhardt Jr told reporters.

'I thought it was pretty funny.'

Keselowski finished 32nd in the race won by Matt Kenseth after being involved in a group collision late in the race.

'Nothing we could do there... never saw the wreck till we were windshield deep,' he tweeted.

Everything that could go wrong with NASCAR's marquee race, which finished last night, did.

Journeyman
driver Dave Blaney was leading when a problem with Juan Pablo Montoya's
car sent him spinning under caution into a safety truck.

The truck, which holds 200 gallons of jet kerosene, burst into flames.

Montoya's car slid into the grass, and he gingerly climbed from it as fire trucks rushed to the scene.

The inferno raged on, and NASCAR red-flagged the race with 40 laps remaining.

NASCAR officials were examining the track surface to determine whether the race could continue.

'About the time you think you've seen about everything, you see something like this,' NASCAR president Mike Helton said.

'I
think we, like everybody else, would like to see this race finished. 
This is within reason, and we think we can do that within reason.

'We've waited this long. Another 30 minutes is worth trying to finish the 40 laps.'

Jet fuel poured down the surface of Turn 3 at Daytona International Speedway after the accident, creating a fiery lasting image of NASCAR's biggest race of the year.

The clean-up crews were using boxes of Tide laundry detergent to clean up the fuel.

It
was par for the course for this Daytona 500, which had already been postponed for 
the first time in NASCAR's 54-year history because of steady rain all 
day Sunday at the track. 

NASCAR
initially planned to restart the race at noon Monday, but persistent 
rain forced series officials to make an early decision to hold off until
7pm.

Speaking out: Juan Pablo Montoya talks to reporters after the massive crash

Carl Edwards, who fell just short of 
winning the title last season, started from the pole with champion Tony 
Stewart, seeking to snap an 0-for-13 losing streak in the Daytona 500, 
right behind him.

Danica Patrick, making the full-time move to NASCAR from IndyCar, was making her Daytona 500 debut.

Those storylines, however, were quickly forgotten in this bizarre 55th running of NASCAR's version of the Super Bowl.

It took several minutes for safety workers to put out the fire, and then came the task of removing the truck from the track and cleaning up all that spilled fuel.

Towing the truck from the steep 
banking presented a challenge, as NASCAR was nervous any movement would 
dig into the track surface.

Montoya, who said his helmet was singed in the fire and his foot ached, said he felt a vibration in his car before the accident.

'I've
hit a lot of things - but a jet dryer?' he said. 'It just felt really 
strange, and as I was talking on the radio, the car just turned right.'

The drivers were allowed to exit their cars after about 10 minutes under the red flag.

Trouble on the track: Danica Patrick (right), Kurt Busch (left), David Ragan (second from left) and Jimmie Johnson (second from right) crashed into each other shortly after the race began

The racing was aggressive at the drop of the green flag, and the first accident occurred on just the second lap, when Elliott Sadler ran into the back of Jimmie Johnson as they drafted around the track.

The contact sent Johnson into the wall, and as the five-time NASCAR champion slid back down across the track, he was hit hard in the door by David Ragan. 

The accident collected six cars total, including defending Daytona 500 winner Trevor Bayne and Danica Patrick.

'I'm just really, really bummed to start the season this way,' Johnson said. 'To work as hard as everyone did at Hendrick Motorsports to get this Lowe's Chevrolet and to have it barely complete two-and-a-half miles of green flag racing is pretty sad.

We'll just go on and go to Phoenix and set our marks on winning that race.'

TV event: The race was the first-ever Daytona 500 shown in primetime and a golden opportunity to feature the elite Sprint Cup Series

Star-studded event: Attendees at this year's Daytona 500 included Glee star Jane Lynch and Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover girl Kate Upton
