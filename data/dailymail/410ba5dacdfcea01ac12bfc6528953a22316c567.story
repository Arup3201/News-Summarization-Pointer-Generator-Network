For richer, for poorer...is not all it's cracked up to be for this humiliated husband.

These humbling scenes show what happened to one man who tried to keep back part of his salary from his wife.

Kneeling with a sign around his neck, the man begs his wife for forgiveness in Hangzhou, the capital of eastern China's Zhejiang Province.

Grovelling: A husband kneels in the street with a board around his by way of apology for failing to hand over whole salary to his wife

The unidentified man, who was stripped half-naked, made his very public apology in front of bemused onlookers.

Holding a megaphone, he shouted: 'I did wrong,' while begging for forgiveness in the middle of the street.

As a crowd gathered, the man kept shouting, 'My dear, I am wrong. I for sure will submit my whole wage to you.' 

Loud and clear: The apologetic husband uses a megaphone so everyone can hear just how sorry he is for apparently pocketing some of the cash

Declaration of love: The soppy spouse tells his wife 'my dear, I am wrong' in a desperate bid for forgiveness

His clumsy bid for forgiveness is not the first hapless romantic gesture to attract unwanted attention.

In Kent, a boyfriend's attempt to set the mood backfired when candles he placed on the bedroom floor started a blaze which then tore through the house.

Amanj Issen used tea lights to spell out his girlfriend's name and a heart but was horrified when it gutted the property. 

Jana Stankeviciute forgave Amanj but it is not known how the above demonstration w his wife.
