A woman who tied her child to a pram as they wandered the streets begging for money has been arrested.

The woman was spotted on CCTV in the city of Kalisz, Poland, picking the child off the ground after he collapsed through exhaustion - and then tying him to her pram with a piece of string.

At this point a shocked local who witnessed the abuse called police and grabbed a mobile phone camera to film the scene, so the authorities had evidence.

Shocking: A woman filmed on CCTV tying her child to a pram as they wandered the streets begging for money has been arrested

Police spokesman Dariusz Hybs said: ‘The woman was approaching passers-by and asking for money as her baby lies in the pram and her exhausted son tries to stand.

‘The child was clearly worn out, and kept falling to the ground.’

The video shows the woman, presumably the mother, dragging the youngster back to his feet like a rag doll, and forcing him to carry on walking next to the pram she'd tied him to.

The children were handed over to social welfare officers, who confirmed that the woman was Polish, although declined to give any details about who she was or where the children were from.

Evidence: Footage appears to show that the child was tethered to the pram
