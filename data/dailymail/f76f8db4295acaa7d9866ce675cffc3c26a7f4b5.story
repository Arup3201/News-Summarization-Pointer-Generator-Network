Alleged Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is awake and responding to questions in his hospital bed.

The 19-year-old is responding sporadically in writing to questions from investigators regarding other cell members and other unexploded bombs, law enforcement officials said.

Agents are quizzing Tsarnaev about whether he had any accomplices who helped him carry out his attacks.

The news comes as it is revealed Tsarnaev, who is badly wounded in the throat, meekly pulled up his shirt to show officers that he was not wearing a vest strapped with explosives on Friday night as he emerged from the boat he had been cowering in.

'At the end they were just making demands of him: Show your hands, lift your shirt. And eventually that's what he did,' Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau told ABC News.

'He was very slow and lethargic in every move that he made and they could see that there was no device on his chest. They kept creeping closer to him and then they felt it safe enough to pull him away from the boat.'

Authorities initially said they couldn't question the terror suspect because of his severe throat wound.

Tsarnaev is believed to have shoved his pistol in his own mouth and 
pulled the trigger in a failed suicide attempt as SWAT officers and federal agents closed in on his backyard hiding place. However, instead of killing 
him, the bullet simply tore through his neck.

CNN reported earlier today that Tsarnaev was 'intubated and sedated' at a Boston hospital.

The Boston police commissioner said 
Tsarnaev is in 'critical but stable' condition on Sunday - which appears
 to be a downgrade from reports earlier this weekend that his condition 
was only 'serious.'

Boston Mayor Tom Menino had earlier feared that federal agents would never be able to interview Tsarnaev but it seems that investigators may already be making progress.

Police sources told MailOnline that investigators are looking into the possibility that Tsarnaev
 and his older brother Tamerlan had a suicide pact so that neither of 
them could be taken alive and put on trial. Authorities believe Dzhokhar likely killed him brother, who was handcuffed, when he ran over him.

A suicide pact could also explain why 19-year-old Dzhokhar ran over his own brother in his stolen Mercedes SUV as he escaped from the scene, the sources added.

Tamerlan was killed early Friday after a running gun battle with police. Doctors say he appeared to have multiple gunshot wounds, blast injuries and major trauma from being hit and dragged by his brother's car.

The new twist in the story of Tsarnaev's
 dramatic capture comes as the Boston police commissioner warns that he 
and Tamerlan were plotting more bomb attacks on the city and they were 
caught just in time. Authorities insisted that the pair were working 
alone.

Ed Davis said the bombers were 
flushed out of hiding when the FBI released close-up surveillance video 
of their faces and asked for the public's help in tracking them down.

'The news conference forced them out of their hideout 
and they decided to commit further violent acts. But it’s my belief that
 they were already manufacturing explosive devices. Further violent acts
 were inevitable,' Davis told The Boston Globe.

New video also revealed the final moments of Dzhokha's
 standoff with police. The images come from a thermal imaging camera 
aboard a Massachusetts State Police helicopter that was hovering above 
the dramatic police standoff.

Tsarnaev, 19, was captured by police on 
Friday night after the boat's owner found him hiding out when he went to check on his beloved watercraft in that was 
parked on a trailer at a house in suburban Watertown, Massachusetts.

It is believed that federal 
prosecutors are putting the final touches together on charges against 
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and could filed them today.

The most serious charge 
available to federal prosecutors would be the use of a weapon of mass 
destruction to kill people, which carries a possible death sentence. 
Massachusetts does not have the death penalty.

Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick revealed on Sunday that surveillance
 video from the Boston Marathon attack shows one suspect dropping his 
backpack and calmly walking away from it before the bomb inside it 
exploded.

The video clearly puts 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at the scene of the attack, Patrick said on NBC.

'It
 does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, 
put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then 
moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,' Patrick 
said. 'It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, 
frankly.'

Tsarnaev reportedly lost significant 
amounts of blood after suffering two wounds. One was a gunshot to the 
leg he sustained during a running gun battle with police early Friday. 
Another was the wound to his neck.

CBS News
 correspondent John Miller reports: 'They say it appears from the wound 
that he might have stuck a gun in his mouth, and fired and actually just
 went out the back of his neck without killing him.

'That's
 one of the reasons he's unable to communicate, but he can understand 
what they're saying. And they believe there will be a point where he 
will be able to talk to him.'

Law enforcement sources tell MailOnline that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were determined not to be taken alive.

Dzhokhar was also responsible for driving over his brother as he was being handcuffed by police following a fierce gun battle in Watertown in the predawn hours of Friday.

The teen floored a stolen Mercedes SUV and drove it straight at the police and his 26-year-old brother who was on the ground after being seized.

The police were able to jump out of the way - but Tamlerlan was dragged for up to 40 feet under the wheels of the speeding car.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old 
brother Tamerlan 'were going to attack other individuals' —says Boston police commissioner Davis and 
says that opinion is based on the evidence at the scene and the cache of weapons 
the brothers had at their disposal.

The crush injuries are thought to have contributed to his death but police have yet to reveal an exact cause of death.

'These guys did not have an exit plan
 after the bombing, and from they way they have both ended up it looks 
like they planned on never being taken alive,' said a law enforcement 
source.

'Why else would this kid drive over 
his brother. It does not make any sense until you realize he also tried 
to take his own life. They had some sort of suicide pact worked out so 
they would not be taken alive.'

Exactly
 what happened in the boat remains unclear. Neighbors reported hearing 
police SWAT officers unleash several bursts of automatic weapons fire as
 they closed in on the 25-foot vessel.

A police robot tore open the cover of the boat and a state police helicopter used an infrared camera to reveal Tsarnaev's location in the stern.

Officers lobbed flash grenades into the boat in attempt to stun the suspect and called from him to surrender.

He later climbed out of the boat and surrendered.

After he was taken into custody, he was rushed to the hospital.

Suspects: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, left, was reportedly run over by his accomplice and younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19

Evidence: Investigators gather evidence on Saturday, near the location in Watertown, Mass., where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was captured

Many reports say he climbed out of the boat on his own power. The Los Angeles Times reports that Tsarnaev was swearing profusely in the ambulance.

However, Boston Mayor Menino said Tsarnaev was in 'very serious' condition at a Boston 
hospital after being captured Friday night.

'And we don't know if we'll ever be able to question the individual,' he said without elaborating. The suspect later awoke and is now communicating with investigators in writing.

Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana 
Republican who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said earlier that it was 
questionable whether Tsarnaev would 
be able to talk again.

'The information that we have is that there was a shot to the throat,' Coats said.

'It doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in a 
condition where we can't get any information from him at all.

'We
 are hoping, for a host of reasons, that the suspect survives, because 
we have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered,' 
Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said.
