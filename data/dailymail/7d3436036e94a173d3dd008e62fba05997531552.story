At 8am, amid a clamour of television crews and world media, Sean Azzariti became the first person to purchase marijuana on the day Colorado made it legally available to anyone over 21.

For the thirty-two year old veteran his $59 purchase of an eighth of an ounce and a marijuana infused truffle marks the culmination of a fight both deeply personal and highly publicly.

Mr Azzariti is a former Marine who served two tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He uses marijuana to mitigate the crippling Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) he has suffered since returning home.

Sean Azzariti, a former Marine who served in the Iraq war and has post-traumatic stress disorder, smiles as he makes a cash transaction, the first to buy retail marijuana at 3D Cannabis Center, which opened as a legal recreational retail outlet in Denver, on Wednesday, January 1, 2014

In an interview with MailOnline he said: 'For me this is a huge opportunity and the culmination of what I and so many others have worked so hard for.

'I hope it's a stepping stone to other states following and the rest of the world.'

Taking in the chaotic scenes in the small Denver dispensary he admitted: 'It's pretty surreal.'

Mr Azzariti has been the face of the Yes to Amendment 64 campaign form more than a year.

His advocacy was inspired not only by his own experiences but by his awareness of the suffering of many of his former brothers in arms.

First purchase: Azzariti shows his receipt from first purchase of retail marijuana in Colorado. 3-D Cannabis in Denver hosted a media event to record the first legal retail sale at 8:00 a.m.

All too often, he said, veterans fall into lives of addiction, depression and desperation once their days of combat are over.

He explained: 'I have a lot of friends who are addicted to Xanax and antidepressants – all sorts of prescription drugs because they're trying to deal with the same things I am.

'They wouldn’t dream of trying marijuana because of the stigma.

'I want to say, "Look I've done the same thing as you and I've been there and this helped me." It may not be for you but just give it a try.'

Mr Azzariti served with the Marines between 2000 and 2006. He carried out two tours of duty – Iraq in 2003 and Afghanistan in 2005.

His contract had been due to an end a year before that final tour of duty but, he said, 'My best friend got orders to deploy again. I couldn't let him go alone so I re-enlisted for a couple of years to deploy.'

It was only when he was back in civilian life that, he recalled, 'PTSD started to steadily rear its head and take over my life.'

Queues: People wait in line to be among the first to legally buy recreational marijuana at the Botana Care store in Northglenn, Colorado on January 1

He sought traditional remedies, but said: 'Doctors just prescribed more and more pills – they were treating my symptoms but not my problems.'

At one point Mr Azzariti was taking 6mg of Xanax a day 4mg of Klonopin and Aderol to keep him awake.

He said: 'That's when I turned to cannabis. I wasn't a smoker but I'm just glad I had the wherewithal to realize I was going to turn into a zombie if something didn't change.'

Mr Azzarati, now works as a budtender at a Denver dispensary. He is in no doubt, he said: 'Cannabis saved me when PTSD was just overwhelming me.'

Now he said: 'I feel I can help others through my experience. I think my military experience has given me the discipline to be able to turn my marijuana use into advocacy.

'My life now is the polar opposite to what it was in the marines and I love it. It’s awesome.'
