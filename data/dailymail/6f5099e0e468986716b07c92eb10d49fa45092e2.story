One wind gust of 93kph was taken at Archerfield airport, 12 km to the south, at 5:45pm.

A spokesperson for the Bureau of Meteorology told Daily Mail Australia the storm hit at 6.00PM. 

‘There were extremely gusty winds in Brisbane and to the east of Brisbane.' 

'There were also reports of hail, but nothing too heavy. The gust was extremely strong, which meant the rainfall was kept at bay. Most places saw between 20 and 20 ml,’ the BoM spokesperson said.

'There are one or two more storm, with scattered warnings in Wide Bay in Burnett, heading towards Bunderberg. There are also warnings over the interior of the state.’
