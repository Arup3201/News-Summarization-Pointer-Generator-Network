Bathrick isn't the only person arrested to gain recognition for their good looking mugshots. 

A tan skinned, blue eyed scorcher named Jeremy Meeks was arrested and charged on June 18 for a felony charge of street terrorism as well as for a misdemeanor charge of resisting/obstruction of justice.

Since being arrested Meeks was offered a modelling contract and the internet created memes of him modelling Calvin Klein suits.

Meeks also has a felony grand theft conviction from 2002.

Last month a man named Sean Kory who bares a striking resemblance to Jeremy Meeks was arrested for assaulting a man with a Tennis racket on Halloween.

He was reportedly arrested over the weekend after yelling 'I hate Fox News' and attacking a person dressed as a Fox News reporter at a Halloween parade, reports RawStory.

Despite hating the news, his mugshot happened to show up in various media outlets along with his other good looking counterparts behaving badly. 

The original: Jeremy Meeks, 30, was arrested in June and after this mugshot went viral he was offered a modelling contract and gained scores of fans
