Tory MP Christopher Chope sparked a furious response from Labour for the way he described staff in Parliament

A Conservative MP was lambasted for being ‘out of touch’ when he described catering staff in the House of Commons as ‘servants’.

Christopher Chope, the MP for Christchurch in Dorset, also called for the food prices in the lavish dining rooms of the House of Commons to be reduced to make them more affordable for MPs.

The former barrister was trying to illustrate how few MPs were dining in exclusive restaurants next to him last week.

Describing one particular lunch, he said: ‘The service was absolutely fantastic because there was three-to-one service:

'Three servants for each person sitting down.'

Labour MPs immediately pounced on his use of the word, shouting out the word ‘servants!’ in disbelief.

But Mr Chope replied ‘exactly’ and carried on making the case for lower prices.

Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow Leader of the Commons, immediately took to Twitter to admonish Mr Chope: ‘Tory MP Christopher Chope lets the cat out of the bag by referring to HoC waiters and waitresses as 'servants!'’

Labour whip Jonathan Ashworth also expressed disbelief, saying: ‘Good grief - a Tory MP in the Commons has just described the catering staff who work in the Commons dining rooms as 'servants'.’

Steve McCabe, a Labour MP, said: ‘It’s an outrageous slur on the hard-working staff in the House of Commons. It reveals how out of touch both he and the Tory party are if they think they can call people who work for them servants.’

Mr Chope said the cost of dining should be cut for MPs to encourage them to eat on the parliamentary estate

Within the confines of Westminster Christopher Chope is well known for one thing - his deep loathing of the European Union.

The son of a judge, he was born in Putney in 1947, attending Marlborough College before studying for a law degree at St Andrews University.

He was called to the bar in 1972 and elected as an MP 11 years later in Southampton Itchen.

A junior minister for environment and transport in the Thatcher and Major governments, he lost his seat in the 1992 election.

Returning to Parliament as MP for Christchurch, William Hague gave him a frontbench job but he left the shadow cabinet in 2005.

An arch-Thatcherite and climate sceptic, he called for the minimum wage to be abolished in 2009.

He sparked controversy last year when he made a last minute objection to a debate on the Hillsborough disaster, claiming a debate on MPs' was more important.

A rebel, he once ridiculed George Osborne claiming plans for plain cigarette packaging will make it easier for the Treasury to work out policies 'on the back of a fag packet'.

However Mr Chope – who once backed legislation to abolish the national minimum wage – was unrepentant.

He told MailOnline he had not meant anything ‘derogatory’ with the use of the term ‘servants’.

‘Everyone who works in the House is a servant of the House of Commons. It certainly has been that way for the last 25 years,’ Mr Chope said.

Asked if this applied to MPs, he said: ‘No, we are servants of the government – that’s a joke.’

Mr Chope said: ‘I was actually complimenting the people concerned.’

He added: ‘I was asking whether pricing mechanisms can be used to ensure we increase the use of the House of Commons dining rooms. When I was dining last week, one one occasion there were three people serving for every one person dining.

‘It is good for the Members but not very good for the [House of Commons] finances.’

Mr Chope confirmed that he did not have servants at home, saying: ‘My wife and I do not have any staff.’

However, if the authorities caved to his demands for lower prices, it would lead to a higher taxpayer subsidy.

David Cameron pledged to raise the prices in the Palace of Westminster to stop taxpayers having to subsidise the food bills of £66,000-a-year MPs.
