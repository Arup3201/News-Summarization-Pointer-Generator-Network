'Bad mother': Jamie Lynn Bentley, 33, a mother of eight, is accused of feeding her 8-week-old son only 2 ounces of food every six hours until he lost 2lbs off his birth weight

A 33-year-old mother of eight from Georgia has been arrested and charged with starving her newborn baby until he was nothing but skin and bones.

Jamie Lynn Bentley, of Lithia Springs, was ordered held in the Douglas County Jail without bond Monday. She is facing one count of felony cruelty to children.

According to an arrest report, Miss Bentley failed to adequately feed her 8-week-old son, causing him to lose 2lbs since his birth.

The severely malnourished infant had to spend a week in a hospital so he could regain weight.

The report from the Douglas County Sheriff's Office stated that Bentley, who also has seven older children, had fed her newborn son only 2 ounces of baby formula every six hours.

Douglas County Assistant District Attorney Kristi Wilson said in court last Friday that caseworkers have been involved with the family since the baby boy was born due to strong suspicions that Bentley was a drug addict.

‘It [the baby] was skin and bones,’ Wilson said, according to Douglas County Sentinel. ‘Certain people have seen the pictures and that’s what it was. They couldn’t even recognize it was a baby in the pictures.’

Bentley's other children were also taken from her.

The 33-year-old woman delivered her son in October and was staying at Children’s at Scottish Rite Pediatric Hospital so she could get help feeding the baby.

According to Wilson, when hospital staff came into her room to wake her up, she declared that she was not going to feed the baby every two hours because it 'drove her crazy.' She was later asked to leave the medical center.

Two weeks ago, a nurse with the Department of Families and Children Services visited Bentley's Lithia Springs home and weighed the baby, discovering that he had shed 2lbs off his birth weight.

According to officials, the child was so emaciated that he was eating his own muscle mass.

Bentleys has denies allegations of cruelty, claiming that her son lost the weight in a matter of three days, prompting her to schedule an appointment with his pediatrician.

However, health professionals told caseworkers that the little boy had been in a state of starvation for a while, and that it was not a sudden drop in weight.
