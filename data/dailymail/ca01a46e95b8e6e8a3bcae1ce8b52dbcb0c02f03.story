The darkest hour for James McCarthy came at Christmas when he felt the familiar, sickening tear all footballers dread.

As one of the most influential players in Everton’s squad, McCarthy was aiming to starting afresh in the New Year. December had been a write-off due to a hamstring problem but he had put the hard yards in to ensure 2015 began brightly. Then his world fell in.

‘It was so frustrating,’ said McCarthy. ‘You come back and then you break down. You come back again and then you break down again. The lowest moment was having done all the work and it happened again.

‘I’d been delighted to get back. It was Christmas and I was looking to get going but then I played a couple of games over a few days (against Stoke and Newcastle) and it went. Mentally it was tough. It’s never nice sitting in the stands. You want to get out there and help.

‘We have changed a few things and the manager has looked into every detail, such as my training load. I’ve changed my boots, the inner soles of my shoes. They looked at my car but that was okay. I am just delighted to be back. Now it is about putting things right.’

There is an unmistakable sense that the Republic of Ireland midfielder is eager to make up for lost time. Everton’s season was ticking along nicely before he was injured in Wolfsburg in November. Since then, the collapse has been bewildering.

How much has been down to his absence? He has missed 14 games so far and Everton have won just two; with him in the team the win percentage jumps from 14.3 to 36 and they are also more potent in front of goal.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez is at his most gushing when talking about McCarthy. He has been a huge influence, dating back to when he signed him for Wigan from Hamilton Academicals in June 2009, shortly after he was Scotland’s Young Player of the Year.

Growing up in the Castlemilk area of Glasgow, McCarthy was a gifted footballer and both Reading and Liverpool wanted to sign him.

‘I didn’t want to be away from home when I was that age,’ McCarthy explains. ‘I was only 15. Liverpool and Reading both looked after me really well but I was happy to stay at Hamilton. I made the right decision. I wanted to play as many games as I could.’

Something with Martinez clicked when they met and the education he received in Wigan has accelerated his development.

Martinez is under scrutiny, with some Evertonians having gone cold at his unrelentingly optimistic appraisals, but few are better placed than McCarthy to give an insight into what makes his manager tick.

Is he too positive? ‘I don’t think so,’ McCarthy replies.

‘You need to be positive. If he was permanently negative, the club would be a depressing place to be. He has got the right attitude. I have worked with him for five, six seasons now and I know him down to a tee.

‘He is positive and that is what we need. He wants it to rub off on the boys. We know things haven’t been good enough and we need to pick up the standards.’

McCarthy has not long turned 24 but he speaks with maturity and it is easy to see why he is being regarded as a potential captain for club and country.

‘From the outside looking in, you can hear people starting to panic, saying “Everton this” and “Everton that”,’ says McCarthy. ‘We have got 10 games left to put it right. We need to stick together and we will only get up the table by doing that.’
