Web giant: Online retailer Amazon.com wants to register the .amazon domain name

South America is squaring up to online retailer Amazon in a battle over the coveted web domain name the firm shares with the continent’s tropical rainforest.

Brazil and Peru are formally opposing the e-commerce giant’s plans to register the .amazon URL ending with the internet overseer Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

The countries, which host 73 per cent of the jungle, say it would stop ‘the use of this domain for purposes of public interest’.

These, they added, ‘related to the protection, promotion and awareness raising on issues related to the Amazon biome.’

It would also, they said, ‘hinder the possibility of use of this domain to congregate web pages related to the population inhabiting the geographical region’.

ICANN said it will now send Amazon.com an ‘early warning’ where it will ask for the firm’s reasons for applying to use the sought-after name.

It will then weigh up both sides of the argument, and make its final decision as to who should be allowed to use it. A time frame has not been given.

The U.S. company has already spent 
£100,000 in trying to register the name, and this would be returned if 
the application was ultimately rejected, reported GlobalPost.

Objections: Brazil and Peru say the domain name should be used for public interest purposes related to the Amazon rainforest

ICANN spokesman Andrew Robertson told the website it was entirely possible that the South American nations could win the web domain war.

He said: ‘I would have to say, yes, there is a possibility that the domain will not be approved. There is an approval process and we are still in it.

‘It was always anticipated that there would be objections by governments. It’s a completely new take.’

ICANN, which is a non-profit organisation that oversees the assignment of new web addresses, has so far collected a staggering £220million for the registration of new generic Top-Level Domains.

These include for .gay, .islam, .bible, .sex and . beauty. Brazil and Peru are both among 40 members of ICANN’s Government Advisory Committee.
