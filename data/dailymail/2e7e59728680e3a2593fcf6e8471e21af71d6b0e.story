The youngest member of Captain Scott's polar team described the 'absolute hell' he endured during the doomed  expedition in a series of previously unseen letters to his mother.

Apsley Cherry-Garrard, who joined the expedition to reach the South Pole at just 24, wrote of his fear when the men did not return after setting out to reach the South Pole a century ago.

In a letter dated six months later, Cherry-Garrard described his horror at finding the frozen bodies of Captain Scott, Edward Wilson and Henry Bowers in the snow after a 12-man search party was sent out to look for them.

He also described symptoms of a physical and mental breakdown and the team's fear of being discounted as failures when they returned home because Norwegian rival, Roald Amundsen had reached the pole a month before them.

Perished: The members of the ill-fated expedition to the South Pole, (l to r) Lawrence Oates, Henry Bowers, Robert Falcon Scott, Edward Wilson and Edgar Evans

'Dear Mum': Youngest member of Captain Scott's polar team Apsley Cherry-Garrard wrote 27 letters to his mother during the doomed Terra Nova expedition. They are now set to fetch £80,000 at auction in October ott polar expedition.

Detail: One of Cherry-Garrard's letters dated Sunday February 4, 1912, almost a year before Scott and his team perished on their attempt to reach the South Pole

Now the 27 letters, which emerged from a family member to mark the centenary of the expedition this year, are set to make £80,000 when they are auctioned at Christie's in London, on 9 October.

Thomas Venning, books and manuscripts 
specialist at Christie's, told The Guardian: 'This is one of the last really 
important missing pieces of the story of the expedition.'

Captain Scott's Terra Nova team set out for the South Pole in June 1910. Cherry-Garrard's letters run from the start of the mission to the tragic return of the survivors in February 1913.

Cherry-Garrard had remained at base camp that fateful day when Scott, Wilson, Bowers, Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans set off for the pole. They reached it on 17 January but to their horror discovered the Norwegian team led by Amundsen had preceded them by 33 days.

Evans and Oates were first to die on the return journey - Oates famously left the tent in an Antarctic blizzard saying: 'I am going outside and may be some time'.

Down time: Team Terra Nova bunk down in the hut on the Ross Dependency during the polar expedition in 1911. Youngest member Apsley Cherry-Garrard, is seen far left

Struggle: Scott's party ski away from the South Pole but were unable to go on after running out of supplies. They may have also been blighted by altitude sickness

Scott, Wilson and Bowers died around 29 March after trekking hundreds of miles and enduring harsh arctic gales. All three men died from starvation and tragically were found just 11 miles from base camp on 12 November.

Cherry-Garrard wrote: 'We have found the bodies of Scott, 
Wilson & Bowers, and all their records... Their death was, I am quite
sure, not a painful one – for men get callous after a period of great 
hardship – but the long fight before must have been most terrible.'

He added: 'Theirs is a fine story... Wilson & Bowers had died very quietly, probably in their sleep.'

The then 26-year-old told his mother he had endured 'about the worst time I have ever had... it has been an absolute hell'. He also worried about 'hostile criticism' on his return home.

In actual fact Captain Scott and the Terra Nova team were hailed as British heroes. Despite criticism of the expedition more than 50 years later, Scott's attempt is thought of today as a feat of endurance in an age of heroic polar exploration.

Christie's specialist, Mr  Venning, said: 'With hindsight, it feels as if it was always a given that the death of 
Scott and his companions would be hailed as a paradigm of British 
heroism, but the letters show us the real fear amongst the expedition 
members that they would be received as failures.'

Captain Scott also wrote many letters before his death on the ice scape.

Impact: Captain Robert Scott was also a keen letter writer and penned his last to wife Kathleen asking her to encourage their son Peter to take an interest in the natural world

Last letters: Scott also wrote a letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, honorary treasurer of the fund-raising committee for the trip saying his team would die 'like gentlemen', left, and right, a Daily Mail article from November 1912 shows the tent in which Captain Scott and his team died on their return journey from the South Pole, right

His last was to wife Kathleen asking her to encourage their son to take an interest in the natural world. He penned it when he was hours from death having been stranded in his tent without supplies in temperatures of -70C.

Scott's failed bid still divides historians.

Some believe he was so consumed by 'pole 
fever' that he took risks which led to the needless deaths of his men.

Others say he should be remembered for the scientific and cultural 
legacy left by the expedition which would change the face of Antarctic 
research forever.

Doomed mission: Scott, right, and his team attempted to be the first to reach the South Pole but on arrival found Roald Amundsen's tent and a record showing he'd discovered the pole two months previously

Divided opinion: Scott, seen left and right during the fated Terra Nova 
expedition, and his failed bid for the South Pole still divides 
historians. Some believe he was so consumed by 'pole fever' that he took
risks which led to the needless deaths of his men
