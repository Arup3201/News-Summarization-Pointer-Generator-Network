It's only the earliest of early birds and the most nocturnal of night owls that will get to take advantage of the UK's speediest broadband... at 4am.

That ungodly hour is the best time to surf the internet, according to a survey which shows there is only a small window of opportunity to enjoy the maximum speeds touted by providers.

It found when the clock rolls around to the 9pm post-dinner primetime, demand on services like streaming video and music slows broadband connections by up to two-thirds.

Night owl: If you want to get up to enjoy the UK's best broadband speeds at 4am it will still be dark at this time of year. By 9pm speeds slow by as much as 60 per cent in some parts of the country

That means most people are only able to get the connection speed promised by their internet provider at a time when they are fast asleep in bed.

The study by price comparison site uSwitch.com based on more than 2.3 million consumer speed tests over the past six months revealed that it is the nation’s insomniacs and early risers that get the best speeds.

With average download speeds falling by as much as 60 per cent during peak times in some parts of the UK, the busy evening hours are actually the slowest time of the day to go online.

The research showed that the average connection speed in Britain's biggest towns and cities is a nimble 14.83Mbps at 4am, but that slows 28 per cent on average by 9pm, leaving users with just 10.72Mpbs of bandwidth.

The slowdowns are caused when thousands of other internet users nearby all log on at once, stretching the capacity of broadband infrastructure to its limit.

The survey also showed that there were massive differences between regions.

Residents of Birmingham and Middlesbrough enjoy the fastest evening broadband speeds, experiencing 12.88Mbps and 12.87Mbps at 9pm respectively.

But spare a thought for those broadband users in Aberdeen and Swansea who have to make do with speeds of just 6.08Mbps and 6.99Mbps respectively at peak times – half the speed of the fastest cities.

Meanwhile, broadband users in Stoke-On-Trent experience the most consistent broadband throughout the day, with speeds between 4am and 9pm only dropping by 0.7 per cent.

The difference in broadband speeds during peak and off-peak times is most significant in heavily built up towns and cities, due to a greater demand on services.

For example, at 4am in Dudley, average broadband speeds are a super-fast 31.81Mbps. But at 9pm, they drop by 60% to 12.62Mbps.

Just eight miles away, Walsall residents are also suffering from unpredictable speeds. The drop off between 4am and 9pm is a staggering 51 per cent.

Neighbouring Bolton and Huddersfield are also seeing some of the biggest variations in broadband speeds between off-peak and peak times – of 57 per cent and 51 per cent respectively.

Julia Stent, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, says: 'This research shows the incredible strain that is placed on broadband when everyone logs on at the same time, particularly in densely populated areas.

'And the big rise in streaming and downloading – be that films for our tablets, or games for our smartphones – means that striving to deliver consistent speeds will be a long, hard slog for broadband providers.

'It certainly explains why some people may never actually feel like their connection is as fast as the one promised by providers when they signed.

'The obvious solution of setting your alarm at 4am to use the internet is far from practical.

'Instead, run an online speed test at home to check that you are getting the best possible service available in your area. If you think you could do better, consider shopping around for a new deal.'
