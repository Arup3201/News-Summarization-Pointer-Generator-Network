A Swiss wildlife park has come up with a slightly bizarre solution to overcrowding - simply eat the animals.

The Langenberg Wildlife Park near Zurich admits it does not have sufficient space for all its wild boar and deer, so the surplus exhibits are being served up at the visitors' restaurant.

Just metres from where the animals once frolicked in fields and forest land, visitors can enjoy dishes such as braised wild boar,  venison in cognac sauce, boar sausages and wild deer carpaccio.

There is no charge to visit the 4.6 square mile park which is located around nine miles south of Zurich and receives roughly half a million visitors each year.

It has 16 native animals including bears, elk, lynx, wolves, European bison and an endangered equine species called Przewalski's horse.

The park admits killing and serving 49 deer and 10 wild boar since 2012, despite having resettlement projects for other animals.

The starter menu offers guests wild deer carpaccio with warm mushroom salad, Arugula, shaved cheese and herb vinaigrette for £17.30

The main dishes include a Braised Roast wild boar with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables for £18.30 and the Venison in cognac sauce with Calvados apples and Frühlingsspätzli is priced at £25.80.

The wildlife park's restaurant has spurred an online petition which has resulted in over 100,000 signatures calling for the zoo to end the killing of healthy animals.

Visitor reviews on Tripadvisor have condemned the park for eating its animals. One user said: 'Loved the animals but didn't want to eat them thanks.

'We were somewhat perturbed and upset to find that some of the animals from the Zoo are served as food in the restaurant.'

Martyn Griffiths from European animal welfare group Eurogroup for Animals said: 'It's bizarre, the whole purpose of a wildlife park is to protect animals, not make them a food item.

'We're disappointed they are taking this approach.

'It doesn't seem sustainable to use these wild animals as food for the restaurant, they should be preserving them not serving them up as food.'

The menu does include a 'Meat Declaration' which states that the meat comes exclusively from the park.

And the Langenberg park's restaurant gets a special mention on the Zurich tourist board's website for its 'delicious meat specialties'.

Zoo spokesman Martin Kilchenmann said that animals were shot because of space restrictions.

He said: 'It's not our goal to sell the meat in the restaurant. If the animals have offspring then we have to manage the numbers.

'It's not so easy to control the breeding of deer and boars. We're not trying to make the menu look good.'

'It's hard to sterilize deer and boars and the animals' welfare is our most important goal. We don't want to harm them.

'The resettlement programme is only for the endangered horses, wildcats and the bisons. There is no need to resettle deer and boar in Switzerland because we have so many wild deer and boar here already.'
