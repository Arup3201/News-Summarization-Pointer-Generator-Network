Criticism: Former Tory minister Tim Loughton used a Commons debate to criticise Sussex Police

Police warned a former minister he could be prosecuted for harassing a ‘nightmare constituent’.

Tory MP Tim Loughton used a debate in Parliament to heavily criticise Sussex Police which spent six months investigating him for alleged racist abuse after describing Kieran Francis as 'unkempt'.

He warned that the police actions were a ‘clear breach’ of parliamentary privilege which if unchallenged could see allow any unhappy voter to pursue a grudge against their MP.

Mr Loughton, MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, raised concerns about Mr Francis during a debate in the Commons in March.

But this led his constituent to step up an ‘onslaught of vile abuse’, mainly against him, including doctoring photographs of his children taken from social media sites and urging him to commit suicide.

During the March debate Mr Loughton, who was education minister until last year, said he was ‘sacking Mr Francis as my constituent’.

He added that his staff had been told to put the phone down on him.

Mr Loughton said he planned to inform Mr Francis of this information in a letter but instead sent a complete Hansard record which included the March 13 debate.

But today the MP revealed that sending the copy of Hansard resulted in him receiving a police information notice (Pin) from Sussex Police.

The Pin warned that this action had caused ‘alarm and distress’ to the ex-constituent and warned he would be liable to arrest and prosecution if that kind of behaviour continued, according to Mr Loughton.

The Tory told the Commons today he believed Sussex Police's actions represented a ‘clear breach’ of parliamentary privilege.

Mr Loughton said: ‘If this goes unchecked, any constituent with a grudge against his or her member of Parliament could claim harassment.

‘Any MP exposing any dodgy organisation in Parliament could find themselves being questioned by the police and... being given advice as to how to do our job.

‘Indeed, Abu Hamza may well have a 
case against (Home Secretary Theresa May) for being rightly beastly 
about him in Parliament and find herself on the receiving end of a 
police information notice.’

Mr Loughton's motion for the Pin to be referred to the Committee of Privileges was passed unopposed in the Commons.

Moving the motion, Mr Loughton said 
he had no communication with his ex-constituent since sending the 
Hansard record while he claimed Mr Francis had ‘stepped up an onslaught 
of vile abuse’, which included targeting the leader and chairman of Adur
 District Council, among others.

Mr
 Loughton said: ‘Many come under the heading of political abuse which, 
however offensive that is, we all know it is part of our job.

‘However,
 what is not part of that job is they have included doctored photographs
 of my children taken from their social media sites - what a man in his 
40s is doing trawling the social media sites of teenage girls I do not 
know.

‘They were eventually 
taken down but he then attempted blackmail - to put them up again - 
against me unless I comply with his demands.

‘He's posted doctored pictures of the council leader's young children with Nazi insignia.

‘He has posted vile contorted accounts
 of my parents' divorce, forged tweets, posted references to my 
neighbours, photographs of my home, most recently a direct tweet urging 
me to commit suicide, along with assorted lies, made-up stories and pure
 fantasy.’

Battle: Kieran Francis has been embroiled in a long-running online battle with Mr Loughton

Mr Loughton said 
despite making complaints to the police, Mr Francis had been arrested 
once and no charges were brought against him.

He
 said: ‘The police have failed to secure any charges and he carries on 
harassing, bullying, stalking, trolling and abusing me, my family and 
colleagues.’

On September 4, Mr Loughton said a Pin notice was served against him.

He said: ‘The notice stated the police
 had received an allegation of harassment against me by the 
aforementioned constituent, making me aware if the kind of behaviour 
described were to continue, then I would be liable to arrest and 
prosecution.

‘And the 
specific single incident behaviour which gave rise to this Pin was the 
act of sending a copy of Hansard to my constituent.

‘Apparently
 this had caused my ex-constituent alarm and distress. That came as a 
surprise to me and various others, particularly given on his blog on 
March 14 that ex-constituent had described how he had watched my 
adjournment (debate) on television with great amusement.

‘Apparently
 Hansard is a cause of alarm and distress. Our deliberations are a 
potent weapon of abuse if you work for Sussex Police.’

Warning: Mr Loughton said the episode raised concerns about the ability of MPs to do their job

Mr Loughton said there was no way to appeal against a Pin and it remains on file for at least 12 months.

He added that Detective Chief Inspector David Wardley-Wilkins had also offered him instructions about how he should correspond with constituents without risking a Pin.

Mr Loughton said: ‘Police telling us how to do our job. The chief constable, who has been copied in to all these events, has been content to waste taxpayers' resources on this nonsense while senior management of his force are brought into disrepute and he has clearly lost the plot when it comes to distinguishing between the victim and the perpetrator.’

In a statement, Sussex Police said the matter is related to an investigation into a series of allegations and counter allegations ‘where all parties have in turn been considered as victims and suspects’.

Assistant Chief Constable Robin Merrett said: ‘We have attempted to mediate between all of the parties involved in this incident for some time, but some have declined to engage in this process and our attempts to do so have not been successful.

‘We did not wish to criminalise anyone, but it became apparent that the issue was not going to be resolved among those concerned and that some form of action was necessary in order to prevent it escalating further.

‘After much consideration and independent scrutiny, the decision was taken to bring matters to a conclusion by issuing Pins  to all of the parties involved. However, it appears that Mr Loughton does not consider the matter closed.

‘In his speech Mr Loughton focused in particular on the supply of the Hansard record to suggest that Sussex Police has interfered with the parliamentary process. The person who received the Hansard report believed it to be a continuation of harassment against him and subsequently reported it to us.

‘We would never seek to interfere with parliamentary processes or privilege, but I strongly support actions taken by the force, which have been subject to independent legal scrutiny. We will of course await the views of the Committee of Privileges before commenting further.’
