Tony Blair has reiterated his desire to return to frontline politics, speaking about it for the second time in a week.

The former Labour premier, who left Downing Street in 2007 after 10 years in power, said he missed being prime minister and was keen to secure a top international job.

He said he would have considered the posts of president of the EU or the World Bank if they had been offered to him.

And he suggested that the experience 
gained from his business and advisory roles since leaving power, which 
are thought to have netted him about £20million last year, made him well
suited to make a comeback.

'I feel I've got something to say,' he told the FT Weekend magazine. 'If people want to listen, that's great, and if they don't, that's their choice...

'I would want to emphasise how fast the world around us is changing and how incredibly dangerous it is for us to think we can stand still.'

Mr Blair's comments come only two days after he admitted in another interview that he would like to be Prime Minister again.

Mr Blair, now 59, has used his contacts made in Downing Street to build a multi-million-pound business empire since leaving office.

It is believed that he earns about £2.5million a year working on the bank JP Morgan's international advisory board.

He has a similar role with Zurich Insurance Group, and has plans to expand his boutique financial and government advisory service significantly over the next five years.

He expects the number of people he employs in his private business and his foundations to rise from 150 to 200.

But the Middle East envoy denied suggestions that his growing business interests would lead to conflicts of interest.

When it was put to him that Labour aides were concerned about his taking money from despotic governments such as Kazakhstan, he insisted that he used his private business to support philanthropic work, including inter-faith dialogue and pro bono work for African countries.

'Let me be absolutely clear,' he said. 'The purpose of these businesses is to generate value.

'How I then use what I take out of that is, you know (my own business)... the bit that is important to me is to build foundations of real scale.'

In an interview with the Evening Standard published on Thursday, Mr Blair suggested that he would make a better Prime Minister now than he was when he was in power.

He said: ‘I am seeing a lot of the world and I have learned an immense amount in the past five years.

‘One of my regrets is that what I have learned in the last five years would have been so useful to me [as Prime Minister].

Because when you see how the world is developing you get a far clearer picture of some of the issues our country is grappling with.’

Asked directly if he would do the job again, he said: ‘Yes, sure, but it’s not likely to happen is it.’

Mr Blair also said Gordon Brown had condemned Labour to defeat by ditching the New Labour policies that got him elected three times.

He accused Mr Brown of having him ‘forced out’ of power, saying he would have liked to have stayed in the job but left to avoid a ‘bloody battle’ with Mr Brown’s supporters.

Looking back to the day of his resignation, he said: 'I didn’t want to go but I felt that I had to.

'The only choice would have been to have fought a very bloody battle internally which I thought would damage the country as well as the party.'
