Prince George will carry out his debut public engagement tomorrow at a parent and baby group – meeting everyone from a single mother to a gay couple.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will take their eight-month-old son to a playgroup at Government House, the home of the Governor-General in Wellington, organised by the parent support organisation Plunket.

All of the babies who will meet Prince George were born within a few weeks of his birthday on July 22 last year.

It will be the first time that the third in line to the throne has undertaken a public duty – of sorts.

But it clearly won’t be the last, in a lifetime of royal service.

The lucky ten families who have been chosen to meet the Cambridges spoke of their excitement today and said they were looking forward to swapping anecdotes about the trials and tribulations of being first-time parents.

Kate Bainbridge, 29, a tax accountant whose daughter Sophie was born on July 11, said: 'I’ve had a few jealous looks from other parents when they found out we were meeting the Duke and Duchess.

'Even though we come from a very different background we have got a lot in common with the Duke and Duchess because we’ve been through the sleepless nights and we can talk to them about our experiences.

'We are all first-time parents, like them, so it should be quite easy to chat to them.'

Philip Gray, 40, who will meet the couple with his wife Alana, 31, and daughter Lily, born on July 16, said: 'The good thing about kids is they’re unpredictable so I’m sure there will be a lot of laughter.

Babies are a great ice-breaker.'

Also meeting the royal visitors will be gay fathers Jared and Ryan Mullen and their daughter Isabella.

Jared, from Oregon, US, and Ryan, from Australia, were chosen to represent the growing numbers of same-sex couples in New Zealand who use Plunket’s parental support services.

Tristine Clark, New Zealand president of Plunket, said: 'The parents are a spread of all the communities in New Zealand, including Maoris, Samoans, people of Chinese descent and gay couples.

'This is a very multi-cultural country and we wanted the Duke and Duchess to meet people from all backgrounds.'

Mrs Clark said the Duke and Duchess did not specifically ask to meet a gay couple, leaving the choice of parents entirely down to Plunket.

Tina Syme, Plunket’s area manager for Wellington, was the woman tasked with choosing the ten sets of parents.

She said she started by looking for local couples whose children were born around the same time as Prince George, looked for parents from diverse backgrounds and tried to get an even split of girls and boys.

'The first 10 people who I called and who picked up the phone are the ones who will be attending,” she said.

'There are some couples who I called and who have missed out because they didn’t answer.'

Mr Gray said he will be the third generation of his family to meet a royal visitor.

His grandfather Bob Graham met the Queen when he was serving in the Royal New Zealand Air Force and his father Robert Gray met the Prince of Wales.

'Now I’m meeting the next two generations down, and maybe our daughter will met Prince George’s children one day,' said Mr Gray, an accountant.

His wife Alana, who works in marketing, said: 'We followed the Duchess’s pregnancy and birth because it was happening at the same that I was pregnant.

'It’s a nice link to the UK.'

The Royal New Zealand Plunket Society, known to all as Plunket, was founded in 1907 by paediatrician Sir Frederic Truby King.

He wanted to help babies and mothers dying of malnutrition and disease, and in 1908 the influential Victoria Plunket, wife of the then Governor-General, became its patron, giving the organisation her name.

Today Plunket, a non-profit organisation, helps more than 90 per cent of all babies born in New Zealand, with free childcare advice, home visits and other services including child car seat rental.

Earlier this week it caused controversy by fitting a forward-facing car seat for eight-month-old Prince George in the Cambridges’ official car, despite telling parents all children under the age of two should be in rear-facing seats.

The Duke and Duchess are currently enjoying a day of rest and recuperation with George after their 30-hour flight from London.
