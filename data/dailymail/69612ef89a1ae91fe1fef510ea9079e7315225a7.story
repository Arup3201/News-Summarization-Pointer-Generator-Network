Walt Disney Comapny, which owns the ABC broadcast network and a suite of cable channels, is axing junk-food ads from its TV programmes, radio shows and websites aimed at children and announced the change alongside First Lady Michelle Obama.

Mrs Obama has championed the fight against obesity, and her presence at the press conference was timed to coincide with her taped reading of the nightly Top Ten segment of David Letterman's talk show, where she extolled the virtues of gardening.

Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger announced the company's change with Mrs Obama in Washington.

'This
 is huge,' said Mrs Obama, an exercise buff who has made healthy living her main cause through her 'Let's Move'
 initiative.

The change in marketing tactics is 
the latest effort to curb the worrying obesity epidemic faced by the 
U.S. and will force food and drinks companies to comply with strict 
nutrition requirements if they want to advertise during Disney's shows.

Nearly one-third of U.S. children are overweight or obese, a shocking figure which is contributed to by junk food marketing, a 2006 Institute of Medicine report said.

They are at a greater risk for type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and other serious health problems.

'Disney is doing what no major media company has ever done before in the United States,' Mrs Obama lauded.Â 

'And what I hope every company will 
do going forward when it comes to the ads they show and the food they 
sell they're asking themselves one simple question: Is this good for our
 kids?'

Nutrition experts have long called for an end to child-targeted junk food advertising.

Mrs Obama has long-targeted junk food
 and recently has been making the press rounds to promote her cookbook, 
American Grown, which includes a variety of recipes based off the 
healthy vegetables grown in the White House garden.

A
 clip of her appearance on the Letterman Show was released in advanced 
to its airing on Tuesday night, and she gave a few 'fun facts' about 
gardening.

Mrs. Obama's turn in the spotlight comes
 as President Barack Obama's campaign seeks to use his wife's popularity
 to help him get re-elected.

The full segment of Mrs Obama's appearance will run Tuesday night, but CBS released three of her Top Ten:

Number 7: In his lifetime, the average American will eat half a radish

Number 6: The largest zucchini ever grown contained a Starbucks

Number 5: Later this year the Supreme Court will finally rule on `tomato' vs. `tomahto'

A crackdown on unhealthy food is not limited to the White House agenda, however, as New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced last week that he planed to implement a band on sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces (about half a litre) in most restaurants, theaters, delis and sports stadiums throughout the city.

According to the New York City Health Department, 34 per cent of adult New Yorkers are overweight and 22 per cent are obese.

Obesity also kills thousands of New 
Yorkers every year and costs $4billion in health care. Across the U.S. 
$168 billion is spent on obesity a year.

The ban, also aimed at fighting 
obesity, would affect drinks equivalent to what McDonald's Corp calls 
small and has incensed food and beverage makers, many of which have 
agreed to voluntary nutritional measures.

Disney
 plans to cut advertising during children's programming on its networks 
such as ABC and Disney XD or its kid-focused websites for foods that 
fail to meet minimum nutrition requirements.

'We
 want parents to know that the food products that we license and the 
ones promoted and advertised within our kids programming will be held to
 the same healthier standards,' Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said.

The
 new guidelines, which take effect in 2015, set limits on the number of 
calories and amount of fat and added sugar for main and side dishes and 
snacks.

Kraft Foods Inc's Oscar Mayer Lunchables and Capri Sun products, for example, would not make the cut, Disney said.

Disney will cut adverts that don't 
comply with requirements. Breakfast cereals will 
have to contain less than 10 grams of sugar per
 serving.

Sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces are to be banned from New York restaurants, theatres, delis and vending carts.

$70
 million in federal funding is available to help states and 
communities address the root causes of obesity.

An
 Atlanta ad campaign featured images of overweight children with slogans
 such as 'chubby kids may not outlive parents'.

Food and drinks companies spend around $2 billion a year on advertising aimed at kids.

Advertised 
breakfast cereals will have to contain fewer than 10 grams of sugar in a
 serving - about the same amount as three Chips Ahoy cookies.

Disney is also launching its own 'Mickey Check' label for food it deems to be nutritious to help promote certain healthier foods in grocery stores and other retailers.

A 2006 Institute of Medicine report said junk food marketing contributed to childhood obesity.

That same year Disney, which owns the ABC-TV network and a host of cable channels, introduced voluntary guidelines that prohibited licensing of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters for foods that do not meet minimum nutritional requirements.

That helped sell more than 2 billon servings of Disney-licensed fruits and vegetables since then, Iger said at the event, which featured a Mickey Mouse character making yogurt parfaits surrounded by buckets of lemons, oranges and apples.

Its theme parks also started offering carrots and milk -- rather than fries and soda -- as the default choice for kids meals and saw that 60 percent of parents chose the healthier option, he added.

Disney's new effort will not allow advertising during children's programming on its networks, including ABC and Disney XD and its child-focused websites, for foods that fail to meet minimum nutrition requirements.

The company could not say how many products would be affected by the new rules, but experts said not all unhealthy foods will disappear.
