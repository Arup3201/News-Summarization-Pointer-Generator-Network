A father believes he is lucky to be alive after a severe reaction to ibuprofen caused his face to swell and hives to appear all over his body.

Paul Burkhardt, 36, from Crewkerne, Somerset, bought a 70p packet of the drug after coming down with flu.

Two days later he woke up to discover his face was unusually puffy and his body red and itchy.

Paul Burkhardt, 36, suffered an allergic reaction to ibuprofen which caused his face to blow up 

Mr Burkhardt woke up in the middle of the night with itchy, red hives all over his body 

His GP prescribed steroids and anti-histamines to counteract the reaction. Mr Burkhardt insists he had not taken more than the recommended dose of ibuprofen 

Mr Burkhardt, a mechanical engineer, rushed to his local GP surgery where he was prescribed steroids and antihistamines to counteract the reaction. 

The father-of-one believes just one more dose of the pills could have proved fatal.

'It was unbelievable,' he said. 'It's scary to think that a 70p packet of medication can do that to you.

'I was lucky to get to the doctor when I did. Anaphlyaxis could have set in which would have caused my oesophagus to swell up - I could have died.

'I think next time I will just try to battle the flu off without any extra help.'

Hives are a well-documented side effect of ibuprofen and can also be caused by medication such as penicillin and aspirin.

Mr Burkhardt came down with the flu more than two weeks ago and decided to start taking the medication in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms.

He purchased the own-brand product from his local corner shop, and began taking two tablets every five to six hours, ensuring he did not exceed the recommended daily amount.

But days after he began taking the medication he woke up in the night with irritated skin.

When he woke in the night, Mr Burkhardt thought the itchy hives (left and right) must be from mosquitoes, before he realised there were none in the room

He believes one more dose could have been fatal - and is thankful he forgot to take the final dose of the day 

'I don't normally take tablets, I've had one or two on the odd occasion, but never a sustained dosage' he said.

'I read the instructions carefully and made sure I did not take too many of the pills.

Hives, also known as urticaria, are an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps, patches, or welts on the skin that appear suddenly - either as a result of allergies, or for other reasons.

They are a well-documented side effect of ibuprofen and can also be caused by medication such as penicillin and aspirin.

Hives occur when mast cells (inflammatory cells of the skin) are triggered to release a chemical called histamine.

Histamine affects the blood flow in the skin, causing the red itchy bumps. Anti-histamines are taken to block the effect of histamine in the body.

'I woke up in the night and I thought I had been bitten by a mosquito because my waist was so itchy.

'Then I noticed it started spreading all up my body and I thought 'something's not right here, there aren't any mosquitoes in the room'.

'I could feel my face getting bigger and itching so I decided to drive myself to the doctors before my eyes closed over and it was too late.' 

The effects of the allergic reaction, a rare side effect, lasted around a week.

It wasn't until Wednesday that Mr Burkhardt was able to stop taking the medication to counteract the reaction.

He said: 'I told the doctor that the only thing I had done different was take the medication, I've never had a reaction to anything before.

'He said that it was probably the ibuprofen that caused it.

'I forgot to take the final two tablets of the day before I went to bed. Looking back that could have been the straw on the camel's back.'
