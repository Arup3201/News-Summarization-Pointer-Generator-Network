Defender Gary Cahill thinks England took an important step towards forgetting their Brazilian nightmare by winning in Switzerland.

England started their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign in the best possible fashion on Monday night when they beat the Swiss 2-0.

After such a miserable World Cup campaign, Cahill admits it felt good to get back to winning ways in the competitive arena.

Cahill accepts the pessimists will still take some convincing, but in beating their main Group E rivals, at least England have made a good start.

'We know about the disappointment in the summer but we draw a line under that now and move forward,' said the Chelsea defender, who was one of just two England players to take part in all three World Cup games.

'I don't think the criticism will be blown away. It is going to take time but it is a great start. 

'In the period of two games we are not going to change everyone's opinion, but certainly I hope it is not all doom and gloom.

'I hope there are a few happy faces around. I think we deserve credit for this game and we are looking forward to next month.'

Danny Welbeck scored an impressive double while Raheem Sterling and Wayne Rooney put on strong displays in attack.

Cahill thinks praise should also be reserved for goalkeeper Joe Hart, who pulled off two stunning saves from Haris Seferovic.

Cahill said: 'In the last two games, when called upon Joe has produced some important saves for us. He has been fantastic.'
