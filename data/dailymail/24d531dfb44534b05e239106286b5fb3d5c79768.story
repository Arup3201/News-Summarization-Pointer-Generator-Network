Jose Mourinho revealed he prepared his Chelsea players to deal with the threat of Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini all week – only to be told by a hotel doorman that the Belgian was not playing.

Mourinho planned for Kurt Zouma to man mark Fellaini - with teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek playing the 6ft 4in midfielder in training.

But he feared his tactical master plan was set to be for nothing when the Chelsea boss was told that the Manchester United man was not playing by the doorman at the club's hotel.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has admitted his side were confused as to whether Fellaini was playing

Mourinho, relaying his conversation with the doorman, said: 'Fellaini doesn't play because he was here to get tickets for the game from Eden Hazard. He was dressed in jeans, this and that'.

'(It) didn't smell well for me. I go to Google and I put 'Fellaini brother'. Images. 

'So I go with the pictures to the doorman. I say 'hey, this one or this one?' And he looks 'this one'. 'He's the brother'.'

Mourinho said the other Fellaini - his twin brother Mansour - posed for photos as the United player, who had been in the Blues boss' thoughts all week, did start the game at Stamford Bridge which Chelsea won 1-0 to move within two wins of the Premier League title.

Indeed, Chelsea could claim the trophy as early as April 29 should they beat Arsenal and Leicester in their next two fixtures.  

In the end, Fellaini did play at Stamford Bridge, but was dealt with in midfield by Chelsea's Kurt Zouma (left)
