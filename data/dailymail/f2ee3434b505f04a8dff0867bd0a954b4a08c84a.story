Stumbling block: BAE Systems and EADS have been told their planned mega 
defence merger must include safeguards for Britain's Trident nuclear submarines

The future of Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent could prove a key stumbling block to the £31billion merger between BAE Systems and EADS.

Ministry of Defence officials have told the firms their planned mega defence merger must include safeguards for the Trident nuclear submarines, which are made by BAE at its Barrow-in-Furness plant in Cumbria.

The deal would create a rival to America’s Boeing and the merged company would have combined sales of £60billion and a global workforce of 220,000.

Ministers are understood to have drawn up a series of ‘red line’ issues involving national security, any of which could derail the deal if agreement cannot be reached.

Britain has a ‘golden share’ in BAE Systems, which the Government can use to block any takeover if politicians fear it won’t be in the national interest.

Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Commons business select committee, said he was ‘quite prepared’ to lead an investigation into the deal.

Mr Bailey, Labour MP for West Bromwich West, said: ‘There are issues about protecting British industry and employment.

‘There is concern that management and commercial decisions would be taken at the European level rather than British level.’

EADS, whose subsidiaries include Airbus, has been troubled by continual interference from the French and German governments, which are large shareholders.

Dismantling the company’s structure so this would not happen with a combined group is key to the deal winning approval here.

Veteran City commentator David Buik, from spread betting firm Cantor Index said: ‘The UK government is clearly very concerned about the safety of Trident as a result of any merger between EADS and BAE Systems.

This possible merger will remain a minefield of political and commercial concerns.’

It is thought a separate defence unit based in London and headed by BAE chief executive Ian King is being planned. The enlarged group is likely to be headed by EADS boss Tom Enders, a former German paratrooper.

Professor Keith Hayward, head of 
research at the Royal Aeronautical Society, said the new company would 
struggle to stand up to its largest shareholders.

‘The history of EADS has been a struggle to keep the German and French governments from telling Airbus what to do,’ he said.

BAE
has focused recent expansion on the key US defence market. Professor 
Hayward added: ‘The other issue is what the Americans will think about 
the deal. They do not want anything like the French engaging in the 
secrets of the American defence business.

‘Even ring-fencing the defence unit 
under Ian King and based in the UK may not be enough. In my experience 
governments look at the top line of who owns the company.’

Last
week Andrew Gollan, an analyst at broker Investec, urged BAE investors 
to sell their shares, citing the complexities of the deal and the 
‘politically-sensitive issues’ involved.

But the combination would see defence-focused BAE Systems gain access to EADS’ commercial aviation business, dominated by Airbus. EADS hopes the merger will help it win more US defence work.

Inevitably any deal of this size will  see some duplication, with job losses a likely consequence.Today more than 20 MPs with BAE factories in their constituencies will attend an emergency meeting at Westminster to decide on a course of action.

The crisis talks were organised by Ben Wallace, Labour MP for Wyre and Preston North, who represents many workers employed by BAE at its Warton base in Lancashire.

He called the deal ‘a takeover’ and warned it would lead to job cuts and would upset the UK’s defence relationship with the US.

‘What I don’t want to see is the French sweeping in and saying we will just get rid of the British workforce,’ he said.
