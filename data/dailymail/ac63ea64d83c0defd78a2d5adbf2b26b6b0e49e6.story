A south London kebab shop is rubbing shoulders with top name Michelin star chefs as one of the capital’s top ten restaurants.

Meze Mengal was only opened 12 years ago by Turkish brothers Sahin and Ahmet Gok, but ranks higher than The Ritz, Barrafina, Whits and Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley on TripAdvisor.

It is currently ranked as seventh, with 
only Michelin starred restaurants scoring higher than its 95 per cent 
approval rating - Gordon Ramsay’s Petrus and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, 
Brett Graham’s The Ledbury, Michael Roux’s La Gavroche, Da Palo’s in 
Charlotte Street and Mayfair’s Goodman steakhouse.

The brothers came to London in the 80s, starting their culinary journey at a Wimpy in Kingston-Upon-Thames, before opening their own kebab shop in Ladywell, Lewisham, in 1987.

The shop expanded into a neighbouring cafe nine years later, and Sahin, 43, and Ahmet, 45, took on the Lewisham Way, St John’s, premises in 2000 after living above the shop.

Sahin said of the news that his restaurant ranked 7th out of more than 10,000 reviewed: 'The news is really good. It’s nice when you do something for people and they appreciate it.

'We are very proud and it’s a really 
nice feeling. We work hard and love our jobs. To see this reaction from 
the customers is a brilliant thing.'

The
lamb, fish and chicken are cooked on skewers over a charcoal grill in 
the main restaurant, while elaborate pide dishes are baked in a brick 
oven at the back.

Sahin
said: 'When we opened there was nowhere like us in the area. Turkish 
food had a very bad reputation - doner kebabs dripping with oil - and we
wanted to change that and show people what Turkish cooking is like.

'We had tablecloths, nice silverware and wine glasses on the tables. Everything to get away from that takeaway image.

'Our prices are very reasonable and the food is always very fresh and we make everything ourselves - including our bread.'

The prices total around £12 for main 
courses, with mixed mezzes under £10, and house white at £10, while a 
bottle of Moet and Chandon champagne will set customers back £40.

Satisfaction: It is currently ranked as seventh, with only Michelin starred restaurants scoring higher than its 95 per cent approval rating

Despite
glowing reviews from most customers, Sahin freely admits the restaurant
gets a fair share of bad ones too - although he 'reads the reviews and 
learns from them'.

He adds the restaurant’s success could
be down to the atmosphere and the fact him and his brother do their 
jobs 'from the heart', and 'not for the money'.

'If people are going to order 
too much food then we’ll tell them. They are surprised when we let them 
know but we do this job from the heart and not for the money.'

Taking on The Ritz: The brothers are now planning to expand the 80-strong restaurant to house more diners

The
brothers are now planning to expand the 80-strong restaurant to house 
more diners, but are keen to 'keep it nice and cosy for customers'.

One happy customer wrote on TripAdvisor: 'We were here last year and loved it and went back with friends. It is excellent.

'Good, sound unpretentious food at a great price and a warm friendly feel about the place.'

Another
reviewer wrote: 'Beautiful food, great service, lovely atmosphere, 
friendly and helpful staff. What else do you look for in a restaurant??

'Enjoyed every moment. Just loved it. Will be back!'
