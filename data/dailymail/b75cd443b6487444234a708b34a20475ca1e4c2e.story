Plea: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson asked the industry to try to reduce costs

Water companies have been urged by ministers to scrap planned hikes in bills to ease the pressure on family finances.

The government has ordered the water regulator to ‘get under the skin’ of suppliers to ensure bills are not increased simply to maximise profits.

Ministers have been under fire for their failure to prevent major rises in gas and electricity bills this winter by the Big Six firms who hiked prices by an average of 9.1 per cent.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson today asked the industry to try to reduce costs – and will promise bill payers a ‘fair deal’ by writing to the companies to stress ‘the tough times that households are facing and the crucial role that the industry can play to bring costs down’.

Household water bills are set by regulator Ofwat, and increased by 3.5 per cent for this year – or £13 – to an average of £388 beginning in April.

Water firms are more heavily regulated than the energy industry, but Ofwat also believes costs could be reduced over the next five years to reflect efficiency savings and the low cost of borrowing.

Mr Paterson said: ‘We know that household budgets are under pressure, and keeping water bills affordable is a crucial way we can help hardworking people. That is why we are pressing hard to make sure customers get a fair deal.’

Firms will be ‘encouraged’ to review planned price increases, and introduce more discounts for vulnerable customers known as ‘social tariffs’ – although this will remain voluntary.

This and other measures are expected to help cut the soaring burden of bad debt - when people cannot pay their bills and they are saddled onto other customers to the tune of £15-£20 per household.

Ofwat set guidelines for prices five years in advance and then tweaks them when inflation figures are published in November.

They believe the next price review for 2015 to 2020 which is published next year could reduce bills by up to £750 million a year - or around £30 per household.

Water minister Dan Rogerson said Ofwat is the ‘key player’ in driving down water bills.

He said that as long as investment was not jeopardised ‘we don't want to see bills going up unnecessarily’.

‘That is now a matter for Ofwat to get under the skin of all the companies,’ he told the Western Morning News.

Sonia Brown, chief regulation officer at Ofwat said last week that there are ‘real opportunities’ for companies to reduce bills partly due to low interest rates. She said any company that will not be reducing them should provide ‘clear evidence that this is backed by its customers’.

Costs: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living

It refused an application from Thames Water which supplies 8million customers in London, to increase bills by 8 per cent this year.

In September, George Osborne water bills were on the cards to reduce the ‘burden on families’ as well as energy bills, the cost of housing, transport and fees for financial services.

But Labour’s environment spokeswoman Maria Eagle said British households face some of the highest water bills in Europe - and two million now spend more than 5pc of their income on water.

Water UK, representing the suppliers, said they were already working on social tariffs and tackling bad debt, while efficiency savings have saved customers around £120.
