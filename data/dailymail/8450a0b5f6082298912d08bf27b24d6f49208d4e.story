A fisherman in Brazil was left stunned when his latest haul included a piece of rocket.

The sizeable chunk was found in the water and then dragged to shore by locals.

Although rockets regularly fall into the ocean, it is not often that pieces as large as this are recovered.

People and police officers look at debris from a spacecraft launched from the European spaceport in Kourou in French Guiana - the South American French territory adjoining Brazil - after it was found by residents of Salinopolis, a city 182 miles (293 kilometres) from Belem, Brazil, on 28 April 2014

The debris is from a spacecraft launched from the European spaceport in Kourou in French Guiana, a South American-French territory adjoining Brazil.

Ariane 5 is a rocket manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency (Esa) and the French space agency (CNES).

It is built by EADS Astrium and operated by Arianespace.

Among its famous launches includes Rosetta, a European spacecraft that will land on a comet later this year.

Ariane
 5 carries payloads weighing more than 10 metric tons to geostationary 
transfer orbit (GTO) and over 20 metric tons into low-Earth orbit (LEO).

It
 lofts some of the heaviest spacecraft in production, which enables 
Arianespace to match up most telecommunications satellites for highly 
efficient dual launches.

It
 is powered during the initial flight phase by a cryogenic core stage 
and two solid rocket boosters, followed by the use of a cryogenic upper 
stage for orbital injection of the payload.

The rocket has a typical height of 165 feet (50 metres) and weighs about 750 tons.

The discovery was made by residents of Salinopolis, a city 182 miles (293 km) from the city of Belem in Brazil.

It was confirmed to be a piece of rocket by the UK Space Agency.

'The object found in #Brazil was fairing from the Ariane 5 rocket that launched AlphaSat #lostandfound,' they posted on Twitter.

The piece of wreckage bears the logo of the UK Space Agency and Arianespace, the European satellite launch company.

On the corner can also be seen party of the logo for CNES, the French space agency.

The hunk of metal originates from an Ariane 5 rocket.

Specifically it is from the VA-214 mission, which launched on 25 July 2013.

This mission carried two satellites into orbit, Alphasat I-XL (Europe’s largest ever telecommunications satellite) and INSAT-3D (a meteorological spacecraft for India).

It was the 70th flight of the Ariane 5, Arianespace’s heavy-lift launcher.

The vehicle lifted off at 4:54pm local time, with flight time to orbit lasting 33 minutes.

The piece of rocket was found by fisherman Manoel Alves, 73, in the Village Macapazinho. It is a big plate of carbon fiber from the outer hull on the payload fairing.

The piece of rocket found in Brazil originated from an Ariane 5 rocket (circled in image) that was launched on 25 July 2013. The mission, dubbed VA-214, carried two satellites into orbit, Alphasat I-XL (Europe's largest ever telecommunications satellite) and INSAT-3D (a meteorological spacecraft for India)

During ascent, certain parts of the spacecraft are expended.

First, the expendable boosters on the side are jettisoned when they run out of fuel.

Later, the main ‘payload fairing,’ which is the section covering the top of the rocket, is also detached.

It is from the payload fairing that this particular section of the rocket is from.

The fairing is used to protect the interior spacecraft from intense heat and forces as the rocket passes through the atmosphere into space.

Most launchpads are located near vast uninhabited regions, such as open ocean or desert.

The launchpad at French Guiana flies directly over the huge Atlantic Ocean, so as the parts are jettisoned they fall harmlessly into the water.

In some rare instances such as this, though, pieces of the rocket can wash onto shore.

On the debris were various markings that revealed its origin. At the top can be seen the year and contract number when the mission was first devised. This was the 70th flight for Arianespace's highly successful Ariane 5 family of rockets

A piece of a rocket that travelled into space has been found in Brazil

Origin was a European Ariane 5 rocket that launched from French Guiana

The chunk of debris is part of the payload fairing that protects spacecraft

It is jettisoned as the rocket journeys to orbit and falls back to Earth

It normally falls in an uninhabited area but this time it washed to shore
