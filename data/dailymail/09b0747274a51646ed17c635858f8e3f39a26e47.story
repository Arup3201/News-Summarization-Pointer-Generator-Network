As lithe male models sashayed their way down the Gucci runway at Milan Fashion Week Men's this afternoon you'd be mistaken for thinking they'd showed up for the wrong show. 

For this season the fashion house clearly wants the gentleman in your life to explore his feminine side with outfits including  pussybow blouses, lace tops and floral patterned vests.

These items, worn with low slung, wide legged trousers, seemed to be the mainstay of the company's autumn/winter 2015 collection, with many models also sporting a pair of the Italian brand's classic leather loafers.

This is not the first time Gucci has decided to go for feminine prints for men. The label's spring/summer 2014 collection was made up of floral suits and shirts, with clashing patterns on the top and bottom.

The models it seemed too had been chosen with an androgynous look in mind with soft features and unstyled hair.

Perhaps even more controversial than the clothes themselves was the fact that some of the models were wearing sandals with socks - thought to be one of the all time fashion no-nos. 

These out-there designs follow London Collections: Men where the models were dressed in all manner of bizarre get up. At the Agi & Sam show they had their faces adorned with Lego, with some of the masks so big the models could barely see in front of them.

Then at the house of Christopher Shannon the models were photographed coming down the runway with plastic bags on their heads and others had the same emblazoned on their jumpers. 

Then at the DSquared2 show and Salvatore Ferragamo in Milan it was all about giant winter warmers. While DSquared controversially showed giant fur hats and huge lined coats, Ferragamo had models walk down the runway in giant scarfs. 

Milan men's fashion week started in earnest on Friday with brands showing off the AW15 ranges. Stars such as Tinie Tempah, Paris Hilton and Jamie Campbell Bower are all in town to see the shows. 

This red lace number - worn with socks and sandals and dark orange trousers - would be just as at home in a woman's wardrobe 

Over-sized coats were also on show at Gucci in Milan with one model a dead ringer for Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em's Frank Spencer (right)
