David Moyes is ready to hit Bayern Munich with a bid for contract rebel Toni Kroos after it emerged the Germany midfielder’s wage demand is only half the amount that has been offered to Wayne Rooney.

After being watched by Moyes at Borussia Moenchengladbach last Friday night, Kroos admitted there were no plans for further talks on renewing a contract that runs out at the end of next season and he was in the dark over his future.

It was thought he was looking for a pay rise that might cause unrest in the Bayern dressing room after chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge admitted talks were deadlocked and ruefully added that it was ‘always about money in these negotiations.’

Deal him in: Manchester United are keen to sign £25million-rated Kroos

But Sportsmail understands the figure presented to Allianz Arena bosses is around £150,000 a week, half the weekly £300,000 dangled before Rooney to extend his Old Trafford stay.

Kroos evidently believes he is well worth a salary that would edge him nearer top earners like Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery and is prepared to stick to his guns.

Though talks have ground to a halt, Bayern are reluctant to sell and will ask at least £25million, should they sense there is a danger of Kroos running down his current deal. 

On the ball: Man United boss Moyes watched Kroos - who wants parity with Bayern Munich's top earners, including Franck Ribery (R) - in action for the German giants last week against Borussia Moenchengladbach

With United’s midfield still in need of strengthening, even after the arrival of Juan Mata, Moyes is unlikely to be deterred and will surely be encouraged by a clear signal he would have little difficulty keeping Kroos happy on the pay front.

Sportsmail exclusively revealed on Saturday that Moyes, and assistants Steve Round and Phil Neville, had been met outside Moenchengladbach’s ground on Friday night by one of Kroos’ advisers, Sascha Breese, who escorted them inside and sat with them throughout the game against Bayern.

Sports Total, for whom Breese works, have since tried to play down claims that Kroos could be heading for Old Trafford, but Moyes has promised more significant signings before the window closes and has the 24-year old in his sights.
