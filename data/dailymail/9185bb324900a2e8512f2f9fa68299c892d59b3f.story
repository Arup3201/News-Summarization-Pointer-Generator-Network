Signs of improvement: Nathan Woessner is now able to walk with the help of his father Greg after being stuck in a sandhole for four hours

A young boy who was swallowed by an 11-foot sinkhole is now able to walk again after recovering in hospital.

Nathan Woessner, 6, has gotten progressively better, and was upgraded from critical condition to good condition as he is now able to walk with the help of his father.

A hospital spokesman said that Nathan 
'continues to improve. He returns to a regular diet today and can leave 
his room to visit the playroom'.

'On Friday afternoon, Nathan got out 
of bed and was able to walk with assistance, and he is eating for the 
first time,' Dr. Diana Mitchell told CBS News.

He
has been in Chicago's Cormer Children's Hospital after a family trip to
the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore turned into a nightmare.

The boy was visiting an area of the national park on Friday and had begun playing in a roped-off area.

His family didn't see him swallowed into the hole, but heard his screams and ran over to the scene.

Woessner's father and a family friend attempted to dig the boy out but the boy just kept sinking deeper.

They
called 911, and a rescue crew of 50 firefighters and private 
contractors were sent to the dunes with excavation equipment.

Recovery: Nathan is listed as in good condition and A hospital spokesman said that Nathan 'continues to improve'

Rescue effort: It look an army of 50 firefighters and private contractors to find the boy buried under 14 feet of sand

Alive: After a four-hour search, 6-year-old Nathan Woessner was found alive by excavators at Indiana Dunes National Park

It was a race against time, according to firefighter Brad Kreighbaum, the team was losing hope fast.

'We tried to just stay focused,' Kreighbaum told WSBT. 'The first two hours was complete misery.'

After a four-hour search that many rescuers believed had turned into a recovery mission, they found the Sterling, Illinois boy alive but unconscious.

Finally after four hours they located the boy.

At
around 8 p.m. they found Woessner completely immersed in sand and 
unconscious when they pulled him out, so they feared for the worst.

It
was only when the boy was on the way to the hospital, that rescuers got
word back at the site that the boy was conscious - breathing, bleeding 
and crying. 

'It went from a very grave situation to...it couldn't have worked any better,' Kreighbaum said.

Rescuers hope to meet the boy when he is better again.

Found him! Finally the rescuers found Woessner and quickly transported him to a Chicago hospital for treatment

Dig faster: Rescuers were scared that the boy wouldn't be alive by the time they got to him

'I
really hope we get to meet this young man because he's extraordinary. 
He went through a lot'  Ryan Miller of D&M Excavating said.

Woessner was transported to Comer 
Children's Hospital and his parents are 'upbeat and hopeful' he will 
pull though, Michigan City Police Chief Mark Swistek told The News-Dispatch.

Recovering: Woessner is in critical condition still, but hasn't sustained any life-threatening injuries or brain injuries despite the lack of oxygen

Park closed until further notice: Park Ranger Bruce Rowe says he's never heard of a similar incident happening at the park

Miraculously
the boy hasn't sustained any life-threatening injury or brain injury 
from the lack of oxygen, according to Michigan City Fire Department 
spokesman Mark Baker.

The
park will remain closed until officials and determine what caused the 
sinkhole and if it's safe, opening it at earliest on Monday.

'We've never heard of anything like this, or any of the dunes around here,' said Supervisory Park Ranger Bruce Rowe.
