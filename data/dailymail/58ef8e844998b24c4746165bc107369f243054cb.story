Peter Crouch has admitted to winding up his mate Wayne Bridge as his wife Frankie takes part in Strictly Come Dancing.

The former England striker saw his wife, Abbey, crowned Strictly champion last year but had to endure false rumours that she had developed feelings for her dance partner Aljaz Skorjanec.

Indeed, the popular BBC series has a reputation for being a curse on relationships and that fact hasn't escaped Stoke striker Crouch.

'I've been texting Wayne and giving him some stick about it,' he confessed to the Mirror.

However, despite teasing his pal, the footballer has also spoken out to praise Frankie's performances on the show.

'I've been watching the show and Frankie's doing really well,' he added. 'I haven't had a chance to watch it with Abbey yet because I'm always at football.

'It's good, but there's obviously something missing this year!

So far, unlike so many celebrity couples before them, Frankie and Wayne have not yet fallen victim to any claims that she has developed feelings for her dance partner Kevin Clifton.

However, the fact that he’s engaged to fellow Strictly dancer Karen Hauer, who is partnered with Mark Wright, no doubt helps on that front.

But Frankie has also spoken out about the dreaded Strictly curse to insist that her husband doesn't have anything to fear when it comes to her loyalty.

'We have male dancers with The Saturdays, so he knows it’s just dancing,' she explained. 'Wayne has nothing to worry about.'
