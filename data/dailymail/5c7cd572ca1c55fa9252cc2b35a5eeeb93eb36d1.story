A Kansas City sports writer who took his own life yesterday morning sparked a treasure hunt for gold coins after leaving what appeared to be GPS coordinates on a website.

Before Martin Manley killed himself outside Overland Park police station, he set up a website that many believed suggested his $200,000 collection of gold and silver coins had been hidden.

Details of the alleged hoard were revealed on a local radio station, leading several people to go in search of the money, according to Gawker.

Hoax: Sportswriter Martin Manley caused a treasure hunt for gold after his website listed coordinates on the day he died

Trail: The coordinates led treasure seekers to Oakland Park Arboretum

However, family of the former sports statistician of the Kansas City Star said he gave the money away before his death, and police also confirmed the treasure hunt was a hoax.

As treasure hunters started to dig around Overland Park Arboretum, the park was forced to close.

In a statement it said: 'This morning sparked quite the treasure hunt. Overland Park Police have spoken with the family of the victim and they indicated that the victim had purchased gold but had given it away.'

It added: 'The alleged "buried treasure" is a hoax. Please be mindful of this and that the Overland Park Arboretum does not allow digging.'

Radio station 96.5 The Buzz fueled 
the search, reading excerpts of Mr Manley's website live on air and 
encouraging listeners and one of their team, 'Mark the Overseer' to go on
 a treasure hunt.

Sealed off: As rumors about a stash of gold circulated police were forced to bar entry to the park

Updates: Members of a radio station joined the search and tweeted details of their journey

Watch: The park had to be closed as people armed with shovels started to turn up

Through Twitter Mark and other treasure hunters, some armed with shovels, sent updates and pictures as they followed the coordinates to the arboretum.

The
 morning show presenters excitedly egged listeners on as they called in 
updating the station on their hunt while the hosts speculated on Mr Manley's life.

Coordinates were listed on Mr Manley's 
website, which was seen by Mail Online, but he made no reference to his 
assets being hidden.

They were listed under a paragraph, with no explanation, as Mr Manley wrote: 'I sold my house which was completely paid for in 1998. The same year I bought $30,000 in 1/10 ounce gold coins and pre-1965 silver coins. Gold was $300/ounce when I bought it and silver was $4/ounce. Gold went up to $1,700 and Silver to $44 making my stash worth over $200,000.'

He then listed the coordinates, which led to Overland Park arboretum.

Clue: A member of the radio show tweeted a picture of a flag in the undergrowth, asking 'what does it mean'

Mr Manley, who died on his 60th birthday, had worked as a sports reporter on the Kansas City Star until February last year.

He had been married and divorced twice, and had two step-daughters.

Editor at the Kansas City Star Mike Fannin said: 'Martin was a terrific guy and a good employee. This is a real shock, just an incredible tragedy. Our hearts and thoughts are with his family today.'
