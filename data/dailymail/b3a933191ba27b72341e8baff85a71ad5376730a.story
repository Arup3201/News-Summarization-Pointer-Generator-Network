From Lady Gaga's meat dress to necklaces made from pheasant's skulls, some designers use all sorts of weird and wonderful materials to create 'carcass couture'.

And one Scottish design student is following suit by creating a handbag line from tripe in honour of one of Scotland’s most iconic creatures.

Jocelyn Mather, 23, has crafted the unique and somehow luxurious collection of bags using the stomach lining of a Highland Cow – after realising how much of the animal goes to waste once it is slaughtered.

Jocelyn, a 4th year studying at Edinburgh Napier University, said: '40 per cent of the animal is edible but a lot of the "off-cuts", like tripe are used for dog-food.

'A lot of abattoirs also sell the hides on to customers in Italy and I just thought, this is our national animal, why aren’t we more proud of it?!'

Her four statement bags, which will go on display at the University’s Creative Degree Show from 24th May, were all hand stitched.

The collection ranges from a formal clutch to a dainty handbag, with tripe either used as a lining or outer material.

The fastenings are also made using the animal’s horns and bull-ring.

'My lecturer kept saying they would look great on Lady Gaga', said Jocelyn.

'It was really hard to get hold of tanned tripe so I attempted the tanning process myself in my bath. I had to leave the tripe soaking there for about a week before hanging it to dry on my clothes rack. My friends thought I was mad.'

The talented student also hit a further hiccup along the way when her flat was raided by wildlife officers.

'My letting agent had been carrying out an inspection in my flat and had obviously come across a pair of cow horns', Jocelyn said.

'But he had thought they were ivory tusks and called the police! I was terrified, but they just laughed when they saw the horns.'

The budding designer hopes her creations go some way to make people think differently about animals.

'If each butcher was given one cow, one pig and one sheep to feed his local community every part of the animals would be used, but in this day and age of mass-farming that just doesn’t happen.

'I wanted to show more respect for this stunning animal by using its less palatable pieces to create something beautiful and unique.'

Famous fan? Jocelyn's tutor says they would look great on Lady Gaga, who is know for her quirky fashion sense

Ian Lambert, Subject Group Leader: Art Design & Communication, said: 'Jocelyn’s designs are thought provoking and like much of the work set to go on show, executed to a high standard.

'This year, our students have created innovative and visually delightful projects and our Degree Show offers a fantastic showcase of Scotland’s next generation of creative talent.'

Edinburgh Napier’s Degree show opens on Friday 24th May at Merchiston Campus and runs until Sunday 2nd June.
