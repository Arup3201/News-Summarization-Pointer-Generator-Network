When it comes to dressing for a society occasion, Princess Anne has protocol nailed. 

Never is a hemline too short, or too flyaway, Never is a hair in her remarkable bouffant out of place.

Styles that would look anachronistic on anyone else just seem to work on Anne (maybe thanks, in part, to the fact that her hairstyle remains locked into 1963).

And so to Cowes today, where the annual regatta kicked off on the weekend. Princess Anne arrived this morning in typically elegant attire, looking as though she had just stepped off the pages of a Sperry catalogue.

Sailing in: A double-breasted blazer, navy of course, white trousers and brown deck shoes made up Anne's Cowes uniform

The formula - and any virgin Regatta attendees should take note - is a navy blazer, double-breasted style a must, gold buttons advisable.

Cotton chino-style trousers, preferably white. Navy and beige also acceptable, as are red or pink for gentlemen.

Shoes, as Anne demonstrates, should be a flat, deck shoe style. For Anne, something sensible and brown fits the bill; others could make a splash with a pair of Sebago docksides (as worn by the Duchess of Cambridge on a boating outing last year), or Sperry, an American company who have been making boat shoes since 1935.

Appropriate: Donna Air went for a traditional Breton look for her jaunt at Cowes, paired with blue cotton trousers and a pair of canvas shoes

With a wealth of experience under her
belt, Anne could well hand some style tips to the less experienced high profile 
guests of the regatta, though one such newbie - who also has links to the Royal family - managed quite well on her own.

Donna
Air, the television presenter and erstwhile actress who is currently firmly in the public eye thanks to the fact she is dating the Duchess of 
Cambridge's younger brother James Middleton, put in her own appearance 
at the Regatta this morning.

She chose a traditional Breton top paired with slate blue-grey cropped chinos and navy canvas shoes. So far so sensible (Anne would approve). Donning an anorak bearing the logo of the regatta's main sponsor, she took to a yacht to meet Olympic sailor Shirley Robertson, who took her through her paces onboard.

Looking perfectly ship-shape, she presented a slot to 
Daybreak television show in which she brought viewers up to date with 
the goings on at the event, which started on Saturday 3 August and are 
set to come to a close on Saturday 10 August.
