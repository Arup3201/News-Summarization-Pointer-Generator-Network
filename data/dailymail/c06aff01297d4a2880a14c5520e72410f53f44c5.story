Keysar Trad, one of the Muslim leaders called to a meeting with Australian Federal Police as the Sydney siege unfolded, is in no doubt that gunman Man Haron Monis would have surrendered, if he had been allowed to talk with him. 

'They could have let someone like me talk with him, someone who had met him before, I knew him and I would have got him to surrender, I am fairly confident,' Mr Trad said.

He said neither his offer nor that of other community leaders made during the day, including that of Australia's most senior Muslim cleric the Grand Mufti, was accepted. Further, he added, they were not sought out for any advice as it dragged on.

'I was saying it all day, let us help.'

'He would have surrendered'. Islamic Friendship Association founder Keysar Trad is pictured on his way to a meeting with government officials last year to discuss the counter-terrorism laws. He says police should have involved Muslim leaders in negotiations with Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis

The same year in which Sydney Siege gunman Man Monis (left) was dropped from the national watch lists, it’s been revealed he was also reported to AFP for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal. Islamic Friendship Association founder Keysar Trad said police should have let him talk to the hostage-taker during the Martin Place Lindt cafe stand-off last month. 'This person was looking for someone to pull him out of it,' Mr Trad said.

It's believed among those represented at the Monday morning (December 15) briefing with the Australian Federal Police, which was in relation to anti-terror raids and not the early stages of the siege, were representatives of the Islamic Friendship Association, Islamic Council of New South Wales, the United Muslim Women's Association, Lebanese Muslim Association, the Muslim Village and a former AFP official of Muslim background.

Word of the drama in Sydney's CBD had begun to filter through to the 10am gathering at a Bankstown hotel in the city's south-west and those involved in the meeting say they made it known they wanted to be involved, if required.

The official briefing was quickly wound up but Mr Trad, who is the founder of the Islamic Friendship Association, revealed that there were tense scenes even as the meeting came to an end.

He said some at the gathering disagreed over the potential level of involvement from the Muslim community, saying 'we had an argument'.

Mr Trad insists that, while he understood the authorities held concern for the safety of civilian in such a risky operation, he would have happily signed a waiver accepting responsibility for his actions, should he have been harmed by the gunman.

On his side, he said, were younger members of the Muslim community, who were also present at the meeting: 'They were ready to go too, there were two of them dressed in their traditional robes and they agreed and said "if it is a young person, we will talk to him" and they were available at any time.'

Mr Trad also wants answers, as to why officials were selective in who was told the vital information about Monis' identity as the day wore on.

'They told some community leaders (Monis' identity) and not me but I would have happily signed a letter taking responsibility,' he said.

'I find it difficult to believe he knew what he was doing, he did not plan it, he had no idea what he wanted.

'Someone like that needs someone to talk to, talk him around and tell him "let these people go".

'I was saying it all day, that would have been the best way to deal with this guy was this way, I am certain.'

More than 100,000 bouquets were placed at the shrine in Martin Place in the days after the siege. The flowers placed in memory of the Lindt cafe siege hostages will feature as part of a permanent memorial, after having been mulched

'I had a couple of meetings with him and he just needed someone to guide him. We were all ready to help, even the Mufti offered to go and speak to him.

'This person was looking for someone to pull him out of it.'

It's been revealed the Grand Mufti of Australia, Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammad, was ready to become involved but was not sought for advice nor involved at an official level, with senior police admitting at the time that even 11 hours into the stand-off there had been limited, if any, contact directly with the gunman.

'At the time I didn’t know it was him. I had met him before and if I had known earlier it was him I would’ve been happy to try and talk to him, I’m sure he wouldn’t have done anything to me at that stage,” Mr Trad said. 

While others suggest police erred in not taking advice from Muslim community leaders, Ahmed Kilani of the Muslim Village sees it differently saying 'I can't really find any fault in what they have done. They were being very, very careful not to risk people's lives'

However, others present at the meeting on Monday morning weren't as critical.

'No one really knew, at that stage,' said Ahmed Kilani of the Muslim Village.

'I can't really find any fault in what they have done. They were being very, very careful not to risk people's lives, we don't know all that went on, it is a tricky situation. I knew who he was by 3pm that day.

'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, isn't it?' Mr Kilani added.
