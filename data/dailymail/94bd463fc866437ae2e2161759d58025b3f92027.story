A new biography of Michelle Obama has revealed that her mother was initially suspicious of her future son-in-law because he was of mixed race.

Barack Obama's father was from Kenya and his mother was a white woman. His parents met in Hawaii although his father abandoned his family when the future president was aged just two. 

The claim is contained in a new biography of the First Lady written by Washington Post correspondent Peter Slevin.

A new biography of Michelle Obama, right, claims that Mrs Robinson, second left, had reservations about her daughter marrying a man of mixed race, but the future president soon won over his mother-in-law

However, despite her initial reservations, Marian Robinson, 77, was soon won over by the high-flying lawyer who had serious political ambitions.

As part of his research into Mrs Obama's life, Mr Slevin uncovered an interview with WTTW's 'Chicago Tonight' show where Mrs Robinson addressed the issue of race.

She told the interviewer that his mixed-race heritage did not worry her. 'That didn’t concern me as much as had he been completely white.'

Mr Slevin told the New York Daily News that 'Marian, no pushover, was favorably impressed with Barack'.

Mr Obama's mother-in-law moved into the White House after he became president to help with their two children  Sasha and Malia. 

She has travelled with the Obamas, accompanying them on several trips including visits to Africa and China.  

The book, 'Michelle Obama: A Life' is being released on April 7 by Alfred A. Knopf for $27.95 on hardback. 

According to the publisher, the book is 'An inspiring story, richly detailed and written with élan, here is the first comprehensive account of the life and times of Michelle Obama, a woman of achievement and purpose—and the most unlikely first lady in modern American history. 

'With disciplined reporting and a storyteller’s eye for revealing detail, Peter Slevin follows Michelle to the White House from her working-class childhood on Chicago’s largely segregated South Side.' 

As part of the process to complete the book, Mr Slevin interviewed several members of the Obama family's inner circle. 

The publishers added: 'Slevin deftly explores the drama of Barack’s historic campaigns and the harsh glare faced by Michelle in a role both relentlessly public and not entirely of her choosing. He offers a fresh and compelling view of the White House years when Michelle Obama casts herself as mentor, teacher, champion of nutrition, supporter of military families, and fervent opponent of inequality.'
