Billy Carter, 14 , died in hospital after he was misdiagnosed with a urinary tract infection

A schoolboy died on Boxing Day after twice being misdiagnosed by out-of-hours stand-in doctors, an inquest has heard.

Billy Carter, 14 , died in hospital after he collapsed at home the day after he spent Christmas with his family.

Medics working at an out-of-hours GP service wrongly put his symptoms down to a urinary infection, an inquest in Bedfordshire was told.

But the young boy was actually suffering from deadly peritonitis, an inflamation of the abdominal lining which was brought about by appendicitis, a coroner heard.

His mother, Melanie Lovett, had taken her son to M-Doc, an out-of-hours GP service based at Biggleswade Hospital, Bedfordshire, on December 22, last year, the court heard.

The teenager had severe learning difficulties, was unable to speak and had the mental age of a two-year-old.

He indicated that he had pain in his penis, and medics performed a urine test and concluded he had a urinary tract infection. He was then sent home with a course of antibiotics.

On two occasions his mother then tried to take him to accident and emergency, but the boy refused to go.

Three days later - on Christmas Day - Billy was taken back into the M-Doc service because he was still unwell.

Ms Lovett told Dr Rihan Bashir that her son had a temperature, was not eating and was still complaining of pain. He had also been sick.

The doctor told the hearing in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, that Billy was alert and walked normally into the treatment room.

He said that during an examination of Billy’s abdomen it felt soft and appeared non-tender.

The inquest heard that the schoolboy had also improved somewhat on the antibiotics he had been prescribed on the earlier visit.

The appearance of the child’s urine and a dipstick test led Dr Bashir to also believe he still had a urine infection.

He prescribed stronger antibiotics and told Ms Lovett to take her son to see her GP on December 27 and bring him back if he didn’t improve.

Senior Coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton, Thomas Osborne, asked the GP if the symptoms did not hint at something more serious.

'Urine tract infections can cause people to feel very unwell and can be more serious. They can be really nasty,' he said.

But the young boy was actually suffering from deadly peritonitis, an inflamation of the abdominal lining which was brought about by appendicitis, a coroner heard, and he later died at Biggleswade Hospital

The doctor explained that diagnosing appendicitis in a child with severe learning difficulties and who could not speak, would be difficult.

The hearing was also told that Billy had an extremely high threshhold to pain.

Dr Bashir said that he had no facilities to do blood tests but did not think Billy’s condition warranted being admitted so one could take place.

Senior Coroner Mr Osborne recorded a narrative verdict into Billy's death at Bedfordshire Coroner's Court. He said: 'The serious nature of the condition was not recognised which resulted in a lost opportunity to treat the condition'

The schoolboy was also not sent for a 
scan because the medic believed surgeons would have declined it because 
of Billy’s presentation.

On Boxing Day Billy went into his mother’s room and was playing on a phone while she had a shower when he collapsed.

He was rushed to the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, where he died.

Billy, from Sandy, Bedfordshire was described as a happy child who was always smiling and loved school.

Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen, and it is caused by an infection, which can rapidly spread around the body.

Peritonitis is regarded a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.

It is often the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix, or digestive disorders, such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis. 

Symptoms include sudden abdominal pain that becomes more severe, nausea, a lack of appetite, and trouble passing urine.

A post mortem examination concluded that he died as a result of peritonitis and appendicitis.

The
 pathologist told the coroner that Billy’s ability to explain his 
symptoms would have been compromised by his learning difficulties.

No evidence of a urine tract infection was found in the post mortem examination.

Dr Peter Gledhill, a director at M-Doc, carried out an internal review into Billy’s death.

He said the red herring which threw the two doctors off was the urine test.

'The post mortem offered no clear explanation of the horrible red herring that threw the doctor’s off the true diagnosis and I fear it may remain something of a mystery.'

He said that the batch of urine tests was checked and nothing was found wrong with them.

Senior Coroner Mr Osborne recorded a narrative verdict into Billy’s death.

'The serious nature of the condition was not recognised which resulted in a lost opportunity to treat the condition,' he said.

'In 2014 somebody does not die of peritonitis and I looked at this matter in great detail. Yet it seems due to the red herrings - his high pain thresh-hold and the urine tract infection - simply misled those caring for him.

'I do question whether people with severe learning difficulties should be accessed in hospital rather than in a walk-in out-of-hours services.'

Speaking to Ms Lovett and Billy’s father, Ian Carter, Mr Osborne added: 'He was a very courageous young man and the memory of Billy Carter will last a very long time.'

Speaking after the hearing Billy’s cousin, Daniel Johnson, said he felt like the misdiagnosis was being 'swept under the carpet.'

'I’m not sure who is to blame, but somebody should be held accountable,' he said.

'I think he should have been admitted to hospital for further tests.

'If he had been seen by somebody who knows about his condition in a hospital, then maybe he would still be here.'
