One man has finished off the festive season carrying an extra 2,500 pounds... after shedding 70lbs. 

At the beginning of 2014, Patrick Barnes bet William Hill that he would lose five stone by the end of the year.

The bookmakers gave him odds of 25-1 that he wouldn't shift the flab and Patrick decided to put £100 on the wager.

Patrick Barnes, 31, from Birmingham placed £100 on a 25-1 wager with William Hill last January. The bookmakers have now paid out £2,500 after Patrick succeeded in bet that he'd lose five stone in a year (Patrick pictured after losing the weight - left, and before - right) 

But the betting office didn't bank on Patrick's secret weapon - playing darts.  

The real estate manager from Erdington, Birmingham hit his heaviest weight of 21st 3lbs after getting married in 2013 to his girlfriend Rebecca.

After piling on the pounds during a honeymoon to Las Vegas, the 31-year-old set his sights on a slimmer stomach by January 2015.

As an incentive, he placed his £100 bet on losing 70lbs by this Christmas at the bookmakers twelve months ago, then started his diet. 

But he also took up a sport in the shape of darts and despite stereotypical images of porky players, the pounds fell off.

5ft 9ins tall Patrick lost six stone in 12 months on a diet of healthy food and exercise, slimming down to a trim 15st 4lbs.

He said: 'It was all about exercise and healthy eating.

'But my secret weapon was playing darts - with weight loss they always say take up a sport, but I used the dart board to keep me moving in the evenings.

'It keeps you walking about at night when you are not playing squash or other things. It also helps take your mind off food as you are counting the dart score and not the calories.

'I'd seen a story in the papers about a man who placed a bet to lose his weight and that's when I decided to do the same.

'I like a bet and it's been a great incentive, but I have never won anything like this at 25-1. I needed determination to get the job done and the bet was my motivation to help me reach my goal.

'I got married last year and my bride Rebecca is 29 and perfect, so doesn't need to diet though she has been very supportive.'

He continued: 'I was a sporty person until I started working in an office environment, so now I am back playing a lot of squash.

'I've also done a lot of swimming, but have kept away from muscle building exercises.

'A couple of friends have been supportive, but lots of others try and get me on nights out drinking.

'I virtually gave up drinking, but had two days of drinking alcohol and probably put a stone on after that and a trip to Las Vegas.

'I juice a lot, use protein-based drinks and bars and make sure I have healthy dinners.'

Bookmakers William Hill take about one hundred bets a year on weight loss, but Patrick is in the top 10 all-time payouts from dieting flutters.

William Hill's spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'When he called to say he had succeeded we were flab-ergasted, this is an amazing achievement and he deserves his winnings.

'We obviously, reckoned he was a 25-1 shot, but he's lightened our wallets with his determination.

'We sponsor the major darts tournaments and until now hadn't realised they helped with weight loss.'
