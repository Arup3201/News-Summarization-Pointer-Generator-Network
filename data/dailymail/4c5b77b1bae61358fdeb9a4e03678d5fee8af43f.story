A dog walker was left covered in blood and needing emergency surgery after she was viciously attacked by two Staffordshire bull terriers.

Tracy Hills, 47, was rushed to hospital after being mauled as she tried to protect her puppy in a park in Laindon, Essex on Wednesday.

Passers-by tried to help the stricken mother, but were snarled at by the two dogs, who were only tracked down after a police helicopter was scrambled to the scene.

Tracy Hills was left with injuries to her arms, legs, stomach and face after she was attacked by two Staffordshire bull terriers while trying to protect her pet beagle

Ms Hills was last night preparing to have surgery on tendons on her arms and skin grafts after she was left with injuries to her face, stomach, arms and legs.

Meanwhile Finn, her one-year-old beagle, is recovering at home after also undergoing emergency surgery at a local vets.

Ms Hills's daughter, Jade, 22, said: 'It was horrific. I want to release these pictures to warn people about these animals.

'I am a massive animal lover, I cannot even watch RSPCA appeals but these animals are clearly dangerous. I want to see them destroyed.

'The attack on my mum lasted about 15 minutes, she said it is one of the worst things that has ever happened to her.'

The incident happened at about 3.30pm on Wednesday when Ms Hills was walking Finn in the local park.

When the two Staffordshire terriers appeared, she grabbed Finn in a bid to protect him, but the dogs then turned on her.

Both the dog owner and her pet needed surgery after the 15-minute attack, which only ended when passers-by intervened and the dogs ran off

She was bitten to the face, arms, midriff and both legs, while her pet was left with major wounds in both legs.

A jogger came to Ms Hills's aid and hit the Staffordshire terriers with a tree's branch, while another woman helped Ms Hills run clear of the animals

The dogs then ran off and were eventually caught by police, who are now quizzing the animals' owner.

Miss Hills said: 'My mum was just screaming for help. She was taken to Basildon Hospital. She has received injections for any infection.

'Doctors also need to work out if her tendons have been permanently damaged which means would lose feeling in her arm.

She added: 'She will also need a skin graft and will be left with permanent scarring. It was touch and go whether Finn would survive, but he is at home recovering now.'

PC Sam Creighton, neighbourhood officer for the area, said: 'Both animals were chipped and registered and the owner has been fully co-operative.

'The owner has been interviewed and we have made them aware that if there are any further incidents while our investigations are on-going, the animals could be seized.

'We will be visiting Ms Hill when she returns home from hospital and taking statements from witnesses. Our enquiries are continuing.'
