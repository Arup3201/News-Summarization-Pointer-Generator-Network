A mother has suffered the horror of seeing both of her children diagnosed with brain tumours.

Sharron Brunton, 46, was stunned when her 12-year-old son Chad was diagnosed a brain tumour soon after his older sister Tilly, 24.

Doctors say having two young siblings with brain tumours is ‘extremely rare’.

Sharron Brunton's daughter Tilly had surgery to remove a benign brain tumour in 2008. In May this year, her son, Chad, was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour

However, Ms Brunton believes the double diagnosis may have actually saved Chad’s life because the family recognised his symptoms from Tilly, enabling him to have an early scan.

‘Chad started complaining about headaches and having too much air in his head and it was like deja vu,’ said Ms Brunton from St Albans, Hertfordshire.

‘People told me that lightning never strikes twice and there was no way he could have a brain tumour too, but I recognised the signs.

‘He had the MRI scan and it was absolutely gut-wrenching to be given the news, but if I hadn’t gone through it with Tilly I wouldn’t have noticed the signs and two months later it may have been too late.’

Chad was diagnosed with a malignant tumour in May after complaining about headaches and feeling sick, whilst Tilly had a benign brain tumour five years ago.

Both siblings suffered with sickness and headaches, which were so bad they would scream in pain.

Tilly was diagnosed after develop nausea and headaches. She also started to sleep for up to 14 hours a day, experienced double vision and struggled to walk

Tilly (pictured after her operation) said that doctors initially thought she was suffering from an inner ear infection but that she was eventually diagnosed after having an MRI scan

‘It is very rare to have one family 
member with a brain tumour, but to have two is very, very rare - it’s 
pure bad luck,’ said Ms Brunton, who runs her own cleaning business.

‘It
took Tilly six months to be diagnosed so with Chad as soon as he 
started showing similar symptoms I wasn’t taking any chances.’

Tilly began feeling ill in 2007 when she was 18.

She was soon sleeping for up to 14 hours a day, suffering from double vision and struggling to walk.

‘I had headaches and neck pain and went to the doctors, but nothing they suggested made any difference. I thought maybe I was just eating badly,’ she said.

‘Then I went home at the end of the first term of university and was really sick on Boxing Day. Soon I was being sick most days and losing weight.’

Chad (pictured before his illness) was diagnosed quickly after developing nausea and headaches because Ms Brunton recognised the symptoms as similar to those suffered by Tilly

Chad (pictured on holiday in Florida) had to have ten hours of surgery to remove his tumour. He now requires a year of chemotherapy

Ms Brunton took Tilly to A&E, where 
they suspected she had an inner ear infection, but the pain continued 
and in February she eventually had an MRI scan, which showed she had a 
benign brain tumour.

She has since had check-ups every six months and was recovering well when in January this year Chad started complaining of similar symptoms.

‘He started feeling ill in January and I put it down to his picky eating, then he came home from holiday in March complaining about headaches too,’ said Ms Brunton.

Chad was given an MRI scan in May which found the malignant medulloblastoma and he had 10 hours of surgery at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge to remove it.

He has since had a course of radiotherapy and will spend the next 12 months being treated with chemotherapy.

Ms Brunton said: 'Chad started complaining about headaches and having too much air in his head and it was like deja vu. People told me lightening never strikes twice and there was no way he could have a brain tumour too, but I recognised the signs'

‘It’s a difficult time but we are just so pleased we caught Chad’s brain tumour when we did,’ said Ms Brunton.

‘We don’t know what caused the brain tumours. There needs to be more research done into them.’

Dr James Nicholson, consultant paediatric oncologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, said: ‘The vast majority of brain tumours affecting children are sporadic - the cause is unknown, and they just come out of the blue.

‘Inherited brain tumours are very rare, and when they occur, are usually associated with other inherited conditions.

‘It is therefore extremely rare to encounter two siblings who have both had brain tumours, and of different types.’

Tilly still has to go for check-ups every six months. Chad had surgery to remove the tumour and he is now undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy

The family is now raising money for brain tumour charities. Image shows Tilly doing a parachute jump to raise money for Brain Tumour UK

Dr Alison Evans, of The Brain Tumour Charity, said a UK study was now taking place to look at samples from people where members of the same family had experienced brain tumours.

She said: ‘We know the chances of being diagnosed with a brain tumour could be two to three times higher if a relative has already been diagnosed, but the factors that influence this are still unknown.’

The family is now fundraising to help provide replacement games and toys for the oncology ward at Addenbrooke’s Hospital and for the charity CLIC Sargent, which helps children with cancer.
