As Vladimir Putin knows all too well, power is like a fish: It may be slippery and hard to grasp but, if your grip is tight and your will is strong, you can hold onto it as long as you see fit.

And the Russian president demonstrated this last weekend when he stripped to his waist and landed a 21kg pike during a trip to Siberia.

He was joined on the trip by Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev, in a clear bid to prove Russia's top two remain unified
 despite reports of in-house tension.

Dressed in camouflage and sporting a slouch hat, Putin manned the helm aboard a small fishing boat before taking a turn casting a line.

State television showed Putin laughing in amazement as he dragged the pike onto the jetty.

The Kremlin chief then turned to the cameras and kissed his prize on the gills.Â

'It was very interesting relaxation. Putin and Medvedev socialised very warmly, talked and went swimming,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television.

While the cameras were still rolling, Putin also took his top of, in his latest show of peck-flexing machismo.

Putin has never shied away from self-publicity, particularly in bolstering his hardman reputation.

He was famously pictured in 2007 while on holiday in southern Siberia's Tuva region swimming, hunting and fishing with no shirt on to show off his masculine physique.

Animal lover: Putin flew a hang-glider following his 2012 election win to shepherd a flock of cranes on their migratory route

He is also a keen jodu player and has been photographed flying helicopters, driving formula 1 racing cars and shooting guns on a regular basis.

And following his 2012 re-election, he even flew a hang-glider to shepherd a flock of cranes on their migratory route.
