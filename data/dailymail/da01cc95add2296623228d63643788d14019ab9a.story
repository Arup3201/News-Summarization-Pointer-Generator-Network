Ed Miliband is so unimpressive that mums would rather hear about politics from Phillip Schofield, a new poll shows today.

More women with children would like the This Morning star and his co-host Holly Willoughby to give their opinions on the big issues ahead of the general election than are willing to give the Labour leader or Nick Clegg the thumbs up.

With eight in 10 mums planning to vote on May 7, David Cameron and Nigel Farage are neck-and-neck, with 15 per cent saying they have been impressed with both the Tory Prime Minister and the Ukip leader.

Asked which leaders impressed them last year, 15 per cent named David Cameron and Nigel Farage

One in 10 people would like to hear about politics from stars like Phillip Schofield, Alan Sugar and Jane Street Porter

Thousands of women with children have been polled by supermarket Asda as part of its MumDex series of surveys.

It reveals that 55 per cent of them are not impressed with any of the current party leaders.

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was ranked third on 10 per cent, behind Mr Cameron and Mr Farage.

Just 7 per cent were impressed by Mr Miliband, followed by 5 per cent who said the same of Green leader Natalie Bennett. A dire 4 per cent thought Mr Clegg was impressive. Some 55 per cent said 'non of the above'.

By contrast 11 per cent said they wanted to hear more from Schofield about politics, and 7 per cent named Willoughby.

Schofield was especially popular among mums in Wales, where 19 per cent wanted to hear his views on politics, and among the under-30s, where the figure was 21 per cent.

More than a fifth (22 per cent) of mums under the age of 30 would like to hear from Holly Willoughby, who is currently on maternity leave from the popular daytime show.

The survey suggests that mums are more interested in the political views of This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby

Some 15 per cent of mums were impressed by David Cameron and Nigel Farage, followed by 10 per cent who said SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. Only 4 per cent were impressed by Lib Dem Nick Clegg

Some 10 per cent were interested in Apprentice star Lord Sugar's political opinions, another 10 per cent said Janet Street Porter.

Russell Brand interests 9 per cent, while 8 per cent named Jamie Oliver, Karren Brady and Lorraine Kelly.

With just weeks until the election, the survey will make grim reading for all the parties.

Some 71 per cent of mums say that they would be more likely to vote for someone if politicians answered questions directly and honestly.

After the recent row over MPs' second jobs, 57 per cent said they would be more likely to support someone who had 'normal lives' outside politics.

Coming across as honest and not too stage-managed or polished would also woo 57 per cent.

Almost half want less jargon and less bickering and in-fighting. Only 14 per cent said a politician having children would help win them over.

The survey suggests that 80 per cent of so-called Asda Mums are planning to vote, equivalent to 8.4million women.

And two thirds have still not made up their mind about who to back on polling day.

More than half (56 per cent) focus on what politicians are saying, a third notice the language they are using and 30 per cent notice how trustworthy they sound.

Mr Cameron last year used a Cabinet reshuffle to promote women including Nicky Morgan, Liz Truss and Esther McVey. Mr Miliband has also pledged to have women as half of his ministers.  

But such moves are seen as stunts. A third thought the reshuffle was a PR exercise. Only 4 per cent thought it would make any difference to the political system.

Hayley Tatum, from Asda, said: 'With 80 of mums planning to turn up and cast their vote on polling day, Asda Mums are an incredibly powerful force and most of them haven't made up their minds on which they'll vote so it's still all to play for.

'Through Mumdex, we're giving mums across the country the chance to join the campaign trail and tell politicians directly what they want to see from next party in power.

'They've told us the policies they want and they've told us what they're looking for in the country's next leader. One thing is clear: it's a vote for mum if politicians take note.

'Mums want politicians to be honest, passionate and straight-talking, to have real-world experience, ideally gained in jobs outside of politics, and to do what's right for them and the country – it's definitely substance over style that matters most to mums.'
