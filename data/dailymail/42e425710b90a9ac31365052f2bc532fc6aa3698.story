Voters who plan to say No in Thursday’s referendum have been urged not to be intimidated by independence ‘bullies’.

As Alex Salmond was accused of failing to take a stand against a ‘mob’ outside BBC headquarters in Glasgow on Sunday, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael told voters: ‘Don’t let the bullies shout you down.’

Up to 1,000 independence supporters gathered outside the broadcaster’s building, accusing it of bias towards the No campaign.

On Monday, the National Union of Journalists warned against abuse of reporters holding the powerful to account.

No campaign sources accused Yes supporters of intimidation tactics, including claims that:

Former Defence Secretary John Reid accused the Yes side of using the ‘language of abuse’ towards women who speak up for union, and he alleged that Alex Salmond’s supporters had organised ‘street mobs’ to intimidate No campaigners.

Lord Reid said: ‘The language I worry about is the language of abuse towards....women in particular...the opponents of separatism.’ 

On Monday, Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, spoke at a No campaign meeting in Glasgow, disrupted by pro-independence hecklers.

Activists said they felt intimidated by Yes demonstrators gathered outside. 

Pro-union Respect MP George Galloway said hundreds of No supporters had faced an ‘ordeal’ as they entered, adding: ‘We are not less Scottish than those saying yes.’ Several Yes campaigners were ejected after attempting to break up the meeting.

Mr Carmichael said: ‘My message to those who … reject the idea we should walk away from the things we have built together as part of the UK is clear: don’t let the bullies shout you down … You’ve got a mob outside … the BBC headquarters in Glasgow, trying to influence their reporting of this referendum.

‘These are serious, serious tactics to be adopted and really, the person who could stop it all and pull the heat out of this is Alex Salmond.’

Speaking at Edinburgh Airport yesterday, the First Minister backed the demonstrators, saying: ‘You must allow people to express a view in a peaceful and joyous fashion – that is part of the democratic aspect of politics.’

But Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone said: ‘These marches revealed the desperate depths the Yes campaign is willing to stoop to … to describe these as joyous is a disgrace.’
