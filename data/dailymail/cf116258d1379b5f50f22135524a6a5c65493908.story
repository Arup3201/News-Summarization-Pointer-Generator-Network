The BBC should be overseen by a tough external regulator instead of being allowed to govern its own affairs, the chairman of the BBC Trust has said.

Rona Fairhead admitted there is a problem with ‘blurred accountabilities’ between corporation bosses and the BBC Trust she heads, and that it is time for proper outside oversight.

Her comments echo MPs’ claims that the trust is ‘too close to the BBC and blurs accountability… rather than it being a sharp and effective overseer’.

A report by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee last week called for the trust to be replaced with a new Public Service Broadcasting Commission, which would regulate the BBC’s spending and strategy.

Mrs Fairhead did not agree with all of the committee’s recommendations, but said the Trust should be replaced with a rigorous external regulator whose sole purpose would be to hold the BBC to account.

She also called for the BBC to have a stronger board, with more non-executive directors and an independent chairman to help keep the corporation on track and prevent problems that might need regulatory intervention.

‘Responsibilities for strategy, financial and operational management need to sit with the BBC executive to allow them to respond to a rapidly changing environment,’ she said.

 ‘Responsibilities for regulation and broader accountability need to sit at one remove.

‘That way, there should be no possibility of vagueness or uncertainty about who will be held responsible for what when the chips are down.’ 

She added the ‘cleanest form of separation’ would be to transfer the BBC Trust’s responsibilities for regulation and accountability to an external regulator.

‘That’s an approach we want to explore further. I think it’s the front-runner,’ she said.

Mrs Fairhead made her speech at a media conference in Oxford, where many were surprised at her apparent willingness to get rid of the body she runs. 

However, others were wary about her links to HSBC.

Mrs Fairhead’s predecessor, Lord Patten, was accused of ‘taking his eye off the ball’ during his tenure after it emerged he was doing ten other jobs

Mrs Fairhead, 53, has spent more than a decade as a director of the embattled bank, which is facing allegations that it helped wealthy clients evade tax. 

Last year, she was paid more than £500,000 for 50 days’ work there. She and the rest of the bank’s directors say they had no knowledge of any alleged wrongdoing.

The former Pearson executive, who is also on the board of PepsiCo, will be grilled about her role at HSBC by the Public Accounts Committee on Monday.

Mrs Fairhead said yesterday she was ready to be questioned and that her role as chairman of the BBC Trust was her priority. 

‘I was very clear when I took this role that the BBC was my priority and that I would keep under review my positions on the HSBC and PepsiCo boards,’ she said.

Mrs Fairhead’s predecessor, Lord Patten, was accused of ‘taking his eye off the ball’ during his tenure after it emerged he was doing ten other jobs alongside his £110,000-a-year position at the BBC Trust. 

The former Tory Cabinet minister had five paid posts and five voluntary posts, helping him to earn an extra £200,000 a year.

Lord Patten managed to survive that scandal, but resigned from the governing body last year after a string of other controversies. 

He quit his role at the BBC Trust in May after heart surgery and Mrs Fairhead became chairman in September.
