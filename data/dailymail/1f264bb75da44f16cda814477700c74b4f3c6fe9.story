The body of a 24-year-old American woman traveling alone in Thailand and missing for five days was found over the weekend in a national park, trampled by elephants.

Lily Glidden's body was so badly damaged that authorities immediately came to the startling conclusion after finding her January 18 following a manhunt that brought in 70 people.

The Tufts graduate of Freeville, New York, had been taking pictures of the animals in Kaeng Krachan National 
Park, just outside Bangkok.

Her devastated family paid tribute to her and her work to help animals in a statement to NBC today.

'We believe that what happened to Lily was a result of unknowable and unusual circumstances which she must have been unable to foresee or prevent.'

'Lily was very aware of the dangers of working with wildlife and not a person to court foolish risks, particularly where animals were involved.'

'She had an educated and dedicated respect for the natural world and was completely comfortable in it. She did extensive solo hiking and backpacking in many parts throughout the West and knew how to respond to chance encounters with bears and other potentially dangerous animals.'

'She was also a fearless individual... We would wish her remembered as an extremely competent professional in her chosen field.'

Park rangers announced Thursday they'd found the body in the park outside Bangkok.

Glidden was found crumpled in the woods after the search team was deployed.

'Her arms, her wrists and other parts of the body were broken, so we assumed she was trampled by elephants because no humans could have caused such powerful damage to the body,' said police Col. Woradet Suanklaai.

Police sent the body to a forensic institute in the capital to determine the cause of death, he said.

Kaeng Krachan is the largest national park in Thailand, covering nearly 32,300 square feet of forest. It is 124 miles southwest of Bangkok.

Woradet said Glidden was alone when she left a camping ground in the park.

'Looking at the pictures she took in her camera, we see a lot of animals, birds, snakes, lizards,' Woradet said.

'We assumed she wanted to take pictures of elephants because that's what the Kaeng Krachan National Park is famous for. We believe she wanted to find them and take some photos.'

On her Facebook page, the biology student showed her love of animals. Various pictures show her posing alongside snakes, wolves and a pet tortoise.

She had taken courses at the Vermont Wilderness School and the Wilderness Awareness School in Washington and wanted to work as a vet.

She was also president of the Tufts outdoor club.
