The actor who voiced Sesame Street favourite Elmo has had three cases of alleged sexual abuse against him dismissed for a second time, according to reports.

Three alleged victims had claimed they were all sexually abused by puppeteer Kevin Clash more than 10 years ago when they were teenagers.

The three, Cecil Singleton, Kevin Kiadii and a man only identified as S.M., brought lawsuits against Clash but last year, a New York judge threw out their cases, claiming they were filed after the six year statue of limitation had expired.

The men, then took their cases to the United States Court of Appeal, saying they were not initially aware of the 'adverse psychological and emotional effects' of the encounters.

But according to RadarOnline.com, for a second time, the cases have been dismissed.

They have reported that court documents state the court found the alleged victims 'failed to provide any reason why [they] were unable to discover their injuries prior to 2012' and that their arguments were 'without merit'.

However, Clash is still facing legal action as Pennsylvania man, Sheldon Stephens is suing the actor claiming he smoked crystal meth as he sexually abused him when he was only 16.

Clash resigned from his 28-year run as Elmo as allegations of sexual abuse emerged in November 2012.

In a statement at the time of resigning he said: 'Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work "Sesame Street" is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer.

'I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately.'
