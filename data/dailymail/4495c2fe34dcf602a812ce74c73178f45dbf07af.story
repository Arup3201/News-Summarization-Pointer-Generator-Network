Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti says free speech is a basic right

A key adviser to Lord Justice Leveson is this week poised to electrify the debate on press  regulation – with a sweeping onslaught against the proposed Royal Charter agreed by the three main political parties.

Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights group Liberty,  will say the measures it contains would give too much power to  politicians – and that it poses grave threats to the freedom of speech.

Her intervention will be seen as politically explosive – and as an attack on the celebrity-led campaign group, Hacked Off, which virtually dictated the charter’s terms.

She is said to share mounting concerns that Hacked Off has become too influential and that it  is effectively demanding a right of veto on any post-Leveson plan.

The impact of Ms Chakrabarti’s comments will be intensified by  her dual role. She leads the country’s main civil rights pressure group – but was also was one of six ‘assessors’ who guided the Leveson Inquiry, and helped to produce its report.

She has said nothing about how the report should be implemented since it was published in November.

But in an interview with this newspaper, she said one of its proposals – for compulsory, government-imposed regulation for newspapers which refused to join a ‘voluntary’ regulator –  would be unlawful under the Human Rights Act.

On Friday the Government agreed to extend the period before the Privy Council makes a final decision on the planned charter until the middle of next month. Most of Britain’s national and regional newspapers, including The Mail on Sunday, have drawn up their own rival version, which would eliminate political control.

Last night, speaking to this newspaper, Ms Chakrabarti also attacked the way some official bodies have ‘taken Leveson in vain’ by advocating repressive, authoritarian changes to the law in order to restrict information in ways the report never envisaged.

Chief among them is the policy to refuse to name people charged with criminal offences – a policy now being followed by about a third of Britain’s police forces.

Last week Warwickshire Police cited Leveson in order to justify refusing to name retired officer Paul Greaves, who has been charged with stealing £113,000 from the force.

Ms Chakrabarti also condemned the rapidly spreading police policy of refusing to name people who have been arrested, though not yet charged – even though this measure was included in the Leveson report.

Lord Justice Leveson carried out his inquiry into press standards last year

She said: ‘It’s too easy to take Leveson’s name in vain but what is the real motive for this new call for legislation? Do the police want to avoid making difficult decisions, or to seek a complete lock-down on information on how their powers of arrest are exercised? It is unnecessary and deeply worrying for traditions of open justice.’

It was wrong, she went on, for the police to disseminate untested information to the press about suspects in criminal cases and those under arrest. But she added: ‘So is any blanket  refusal to confirm the names of those detained or charged.’

However, it is her views on the shape of future press regulation which will have the biggest impact. 

The scope and constitution of a press regulator was Leveson’s central concern, and her intervention will mark the first public statement by those involved in the inquiry as to what should happen now.

It is understood she is considering either a speech or a high-profile television interview in which to make her full criticisms public.

The current ‘official’ version of the charter, which will govern how the new regulator is run, emerged from an all-night meeting in March between a four-man delegation from Hacked Off, Labour’s Ed Miliband, the Lib Dems’ Nick Clegg and Oliver Letwin, the Tory Cabinet Office Minister.

If approved by the Privy Council, it could only by changed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament – something which, in practice, would be almost impossible to achieve. 

Ms Chakrabarti is said to regard this clause as anathema – because it would give the current generation of politicians who serve on the Privy Council an effective stranglehold on the shape of press regulation and freedom of speech – far into the future. 

Under the newspapers’ rival plan – which Ms Chakrabarti and her  Liberty colleagues are said to be ‘seriously considering’ – the charter could be changed if the new regulator’s board and the newspaper publishers unanimously agreed to do so.

In her interview in November, she said that journalism ‘must never become a state-licensed profession’. Some argued that because the State licenses drivers, it could therefore license the media. 

But in her view, ‘driving a car isn’t a fundamental human right. Freedom of speech is.’

She also said she was opposed to Hacked Off’s demand for ‘statutory underpinning’ of the new regulator.

Media commentator Steve Hewlett's guide to the options for press regulation...

What is being proposed? 

There
are two versions of the Royal Charter on regulating Britain’s press 
under consideration. The first is a cross-party proposal formulated in 
Labour leader  Ed Miliband’s office late on the night of March 18, with 
representatives from the other two main political parties and four 
members of Hacked Off present – but conspicuously, nobody from the 
press.What is the alternative proposal? 

There
is a separate proposal  by the newspaper industry  for an Independent 
Royal Charter which it insists will meet the recommendations of last 
year’s Leveson report into media standards – without introducing 
state-sponsored regulation. This proposal is supported by most  of the 
country’s national, regional and local newspapers and magazines. The 
Guardian and the Independent are the only two national newspaper titles 
out of  11 that have not signed up.What are the areas of agreement? 

Both
proposals agree on  the need for a new press regulator to be recognised
by a genuinely independent body. Both acknowledge that a Royal Charter,
rather than statute, is the best way  to achieve this aim.

They
both propose tough sanctions, including the new regulator having the 
power to impose fines of up to £1 million for systematic wrongdoing. 

Other
areas in common include  up-front corrections, with inaccuracies 
corrected fully and prominently, and strong investigative powers 
enabling the regulator to examine wrongdoing and call editors to 
account. In fact, the two parties have moved a significant distance over
the past few weeks in the degree to which they agree. Why will the newspaper industry not recognise the cross-party Charter?

The
newspaper industry disagrees fundamentally with certain details of the 
cross-party proposal. It believes a number of its recommendations are 
unworkable  in practice, and could lead to unintended consequences.

For
instance, there are fears that offering a free arbitration service to 
anyone who feels unfairly treated by the press will lead to ‘fine 
farming’, in which issues that would have been solved by compromise will
now be motivated by financial gain. It also believes it gives 
politicians an unacceptable degree of interference in the regulation of 
the press. 

How does the newspapers’ proposal differ from the cross-party proposal?  

The newspapers’ proposal would: 

What’s happening currently? 

The
cross-party Charter has been temporarily withdrawn  as the Privy 
Council examines the newspaper industry’s alternative document. Both 
parties claim they will not surrender any ground. 

Have there already been consequences of Lord Justice Leveson’s report?

Yes.
Leveson suggested that unless exceptional circumstance applied, the 
names of those arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released 
to the press or public. Fourteen of the 43 police forces in England and 
Wales are now keeping secret the names of suspects even when they have 
been charged. Shami Chakrabarti, an adviser to the Leveson Inquiry, has 
described this controversial practice as ‘chilling’. 

What’s the likely outcome? 

The
Government is well aware that there’s a serious risk the press will 
refuse to seek recognition from the new body, which would render the 
scheme totally unworkable. Then, politicians would have to impose 
regulation upon the press by legislation – which nobody wants. It is in 
everybody’s interests to come to an agreement, and to properly address 
certain key points of the proposal. So it is likely negotiations will 
continue until a compromise has been reached.

Lib Dem MP John Hemming is breaking ranks to back press self-regulation

Senior MPs last night swung their support behind the newspaper industry’s plan for self-regulation.

Labour’s Kate Hoey and the Liberal Democrats’ John Hemming became the first MPs to break ranks with  their party leaders to oppose a Royal Charter scheme giving Parliament the power to dictate terms over the press.

Their move came after the Privy council said the plan would not be considered until it had studied the industry’s proposal for a rigorous system of regulation – which would keep the press free from state interference.

Last night, Ms Hoey warned the Royal Charter scheme would crush campaigning journalism. 

‘If the Charter plan had been in existence  at the time of the MPs’ expenses scandal, the revelations would never have emerged,’ she said. ‘There is an element of revenge to this.

Kate Hooey MP is also opposed to a Royal Charter

‘I have always been uneasy about the huge influence wielded by a small, cliquey, elite. It is wrong to introduce legislation to cover up the misdemeanours and embarrassment of the high and mighty.’

Ms Hoey said the Royal Charter scheme could also have a ‘devastating effect’ on local newspapers: ‘The cost of dealing with large numbers of complaints, many trivial or vexatious, will be huge and could drive them out of business.’

She was supported by Lib Dem  Mr Hemming, who said: ‘I was worried about a Royal Charter  that would be controlled by the Government – but the newspapers are proposing one which is not subject to the whim of the Prime Minister of the day.

‘That is essential. Some people are not committed to free speech and to have them in a position of power over the press is like putting a fox in charge of the chicken coop.’
