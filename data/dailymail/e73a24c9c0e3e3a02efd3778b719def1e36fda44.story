Chloe Turner, 21, of Brighouse, West Yorkshire, has been told that her daughter Ellie, right, cannot attend her local primary school - even though she only lives 100yds from the school gates

A mother has hit out after her daughter was rejected for a place at their local school - despite living just 100 yards away.

Furious Chloe Turner, 21, put daughter Ellie's name down for a place at Woodhouse Primary School in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, when she was just three months old.

The mother-of-two and her partner Mark Thomson, 25, even moved into their house three years ago because they knew it was a two-minute walk from their desired school.

But despite the fact they can hear schoolchildren in Woodhouse's playground from their bungalow, Ellie, now three, has been refused a place along with her friends to start in September this year

Instead, the family has been asked to send Ellie to a different school - 20 minutes away by car.

The full-time-mother, who also has a one-year-old called George, says she has not been given a reason for the refusal.

She said:  'All of her friends from playschool, which is close by, have been given a place.

'We've always told Ellie that she'd go to Woodhouse with her friends - and I don't know how to tell her it's not going to happen.

'Not only is it the closest school to our house, but it's a very, very good school - I'm so frustrated by it all.'I know of people who are exactly the 
same as Ellie - the only box they tick is living close by, they don't 
have any siblings at the school - but they've been given a place. It's 
not fair on Ellie.

Ms Turner registered her interest in her Ellie attending the school formally when the youngster was just three-months old, because she knew places were sought-after.

A few months later, Chloe and her windscreen technician partner were looking for a house - and found one just round the corner from the school.

In November last year, she painstakingly completed the online registration form to apply for a place at Woodhouse Primary.

'The criteria they use for allocating schools are - firstly, priority goes to children with disabilities or looked-after children. Secondly, if there are any siblings at the school, then they consider living distance from the school and then if there are any spaces left they are allocated,' she said.

'There are around 60 places available a year, and we've been told this is a high-birth year so places are even more competitive.'

'After applying, the next thing I knew was when they contacted me saying they had two different addresses registered for me - the other was my parents' address, so I assume they had that from when I registered interest when we were still living with my mum and dad.

'I had to send them proof we lived at this house, which I did, and didn't hear anything back so assumed it was all ok.

'But the next thing we knew, in April I logged onto the website where you apply, and it said "not accepted" next to Woodside Primary.

'It also said "not accepted" next to our second choice of school, and said "place given to Castlefield Primary School".

A short walk: If Ellie had been given a place at Woodhouse Primary School in Brighouse, pictured in the background, it would have been a two minute stroll. Instead her mother Chloe has been asked to drive 20 minutes to a different school

'Castlefield isn't even a school I put down as a choice. It may seem like it's close by on a map but there's no direct route, driving there round all the streets would take about 20 minutes. It definitely is too far to walk.'

Ms Turner was offered a two-tier application process including reallocation, which means if anyone turns down their place at the school, Ellie could have it.

However despite applying for this, the family found out this week that they had been unsuccessful.

Now they will have to try the second appeal process - applying to an independent panel who could allocate a place.

'The appeal panel is in August some time - so what happens if Ellie still doesn't get a place? I'm not sending her to the school they allocated her at, it's too far away.

'I face keeping her off school until she's five, and in the meantime will face all sorts of childcare issues, including paying for nursery.

Chloe Turner says she has not yet been given a reason as to why her daughter Ellie will not be able to attend Woodhouse Primary School, 100 yards from her house

'But I'm going to keep fighting this, because it's ridiculous she can't go to this school when it's so close to our house.

'I haven't told her about it because she wouldn't understand why she can't go to school with her friends, but I'll have to tell her eventually and she's going to be so upset.'

Judith Wyllie, Calderdale Council's head of commissioning and partnerships, said: 'Every effort is made by Calderdale Council to offer parents a place for their child at their preferred school, although this is not always possible where schools are popular and oversubscribed.

'If none of a parents' preferences can be met, a place will be offered at the closest school to the family home where a vacancy exists.'
