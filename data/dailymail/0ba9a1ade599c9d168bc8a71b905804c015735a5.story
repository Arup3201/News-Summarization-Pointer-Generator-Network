A 25-year-old Oklahoma prison inmate who has spent his entire adult life behind bars is suing the state Corrections Department over claims he was forced to have sex '50 to 100 times' with his caseworker.

Philip Thomas Burris Jr. says he had no choice but to have sex with 38-year-old Kasey McDonald whenever she demanded it while he was serving at Joseph Harp Correctional Center, a medium-security facility in Lexington, Oklahoma.

McDonald was arrested last year on rape charges after prison officials obtained a recording of a phone call between her and Burris that included her making sexually explicit comments to him.

Charged: Kasey McDonald, 38, was arrested last year on charges he forced Philip Thomas Burris to have sex with her and brought marijuana into the prison

Allegations: Philip Thomas Burris Jr., 25, says he was forced to have sex with McDonald, his caseworker, 50 to 100 times between January 2010 and June 2012

Any sex between an inmate an a Corrections Department employee is considered rape under Oklahoma law.

The Oklahoman newspaper reports that Burris claims that none of the sex with McDonald was consensual. His lawyer says that if he had been in a position to refuse McDonald, he would have.

'These things happen,' Corrections Department spokesman Jerry Massie told the newspaper. 'I would say every prison system in the country has to deal with this problem.'

The state prison system handles four to five cases of sex between prison workers and inmates every year.

In his federal lawsuit, Burris says McDonald began demanding sex in January 2010 when Burris was 22.

Burris was being held at Joseph Harp Correctional Center, a medium-security facility, on charges of attempted robbery and burglary

The inmate, who has three swastikas tattooed on his body - including a large symbol with lightning bolts and the words 'Soldier Born' on his chest - is serving a 13 year sentence for attempted armed robbery, burglary, vehicle theft and weapons possession. He began serving his prison term in 2007, at age 19.

Burris told investigators that he had sex with McDonald in her office at Joseph Harp Correctional Center and also in the adjacent office.

McDonald was arrested in June 2012 for the sexual contact with Burris. She is also accused of smuggling a cellphone into the prison and with supplying marijuana to prisoners.

In a police interview, she admitted to having sex with Burris, but denied the contraband charges.Â 

McDonald, whose police booking records indicate is 5-foot-4 and 240 pounds, is still contending the criminal charges in court.
