Guilty: Lee Clark, outside Newcastle Crown Court, where he was found guilty of fatally shaking his five-month-old baby son to death

A father has been found guilty of shaking his baby son to death while the boy’s mother was buying Christening clothes.

Lee Clark, 27, was today jailed for nine years for the manslaughter of his five-month-old son Charlee.

A jury today found Clark guilty by a majority of 10 to two following a trial which lasted just over two weeks.

He injured his son and caused brain damage while the baby’s mother Natalie Holmes was shopping, just two days before the baby was due to be baptised, a jury was told.

Newcastle Crown Court heard Charlee was ‘smiling’ and ‘happy’ when Natalie left the family home for Darlington, County Durham, on February 25, 2011 at around 10.45am.

But when she returned to Neville Close in Gainford, County Durham, later that afternoon, the baby was making a ‘funny groaning sound’, his ‘eyes were rolling backwards’ and he had bruises on each knee.

Charlee was taken to Darlington Memorial Hospital where it was obvious he was ‘extremely ill’, the court was told.

He was given oxygen and a brain scan, which showed that Charlee was suffering from bleeding round the brain, a swollen brain, bleeding at the back of his eyes and in his eyes, prosecutor Andrew Roberts told jurors.

Attempts were made to treat Charlee in the intensive care unit but he died days later on March 1.

His Christening had been due to take place on Sunday February 27.

At hospital, Clark had asked doctors if Charlee’s injuries could have been caused by ‘bouncing’ him on his knee.

Dr Malik Alam, a consultant paediatrician at Darlington Memorial Hospital, informed the police and social services after tests revealed Charlee was suffering from serious bleeding to his brain.

He told the youngster’s parents of his opinion and Mr Clark responded by saying: 'I have not shaken the baby.'

Mr Roberts said: “Charlie, happy and normal, was left in the sole care of this defendant.

'Something must have happened while he was alone with Charlee because all the evidence shows he gripped and shook him vigorously.

'The first indication that Miss Holmes had that something was not quite right was when she received a text from the defendant saying the baby was unsettled.'

Clark’s mother had arrived at the family’s home at around 12.10pm that day so the defendant could meet Miss Holmes in Darlington.

Mr Roberts added: 'By that stage Charlee was a very different baby than the one Miss Holmes had left.

'Charlee was in his swing whinging and grizzling.

'When the defendant’s mother tried to lift Charlee out of the swing, Charlee let out a scream.'

Clark showed no emotion as the guilty verdict was delivered, as some family members in the public gallery broke down in tears.

After the guilty verdict at Newcastle Crown Court, Charlee's mother Natalie Holmes said: 'Words cannot describe the devastation I feel at the loss of my beautiful baby son Charlee.

'It's now almost two years since Charlee's death and I cannot say how much we as a family miss him and just how difficult it has been trying to come to terms with our tragic loss. Charlee was such a happy, relaxed gorgeous baby boy who was always smiling and we continue to think of him and miss him every day.

'Following today's verdict we as a family feel relieved that the truth is out and justice has been done for Charlee.

'We would now ask that we are left in peace to grieve our loss and begin to try and recover from this.'Detective Superintendent Adrian Green, from Durham Constabulary, said: 'This has been a complex two-year investigation into the death of Charlee Clarke, a happy and healthy baby, killed at the hands of his father.

'Throughout the course of the investigation Mr Clark has failed to assist the police and in doing so has brought further pain and anguish on his then partner Natalie.

'I hope the verdict has provided the answers the family sought and takes them some way further towards coping with the loss of Charlee.'
