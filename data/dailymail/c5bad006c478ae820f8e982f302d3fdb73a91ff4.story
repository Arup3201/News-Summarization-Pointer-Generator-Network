A son has won compensation from TV Licensing after he was wrongly threatened with a fine of £1,000.

Peter Troy was repeatedly told to buy a licence for an empty property where his mother, retired nurse Marjorie, passed away.

He received several demands for the money even after telling the firm of his loss. Finally, fed up with the constant demand for money and an inability to listen to him, he threatened to sue them. Now he has received compensation of £250 for the stress and inconvenience.

TV Licensing admitted they got it wrong - and have promised to pull their socks up.

But Mr Troy, of Rushyford, County Durham, said Capita, which collects licence fees on behalf on the BBC, was unnecessarily aggressive.

He said the problems began when he received the first of several demands to pay for a new licence five months after his mother died.

He said: 'My mother died in June last year and her house has been empty since. In November I received a letter, addressed to the occupier of my mother’s house in Devon, asking me to pay.

'I told them she had died but they kept sending more letters threatening to take me to court. I decided to sue them for £1,000, the same amount they were going to fine me, because they were not listening. It was only then they apologised and offered £250, which I have accepted.

'I am articulate and know how to complain but not everyone knows what to do. I found TV Licensing to be very hard-edged and a cold organisation who did not listen to common sense.'

Mr Troy was offered the refund in a letter of apology from operations director Alison Roberts.

The BBC used its income from the licence fee to pay for its TV, radio and online services

In a letter of apology she admitted something had gone wrong from their first contact with Mr Troy.

She said: 'If the process had been followed correctly the adviser and indeed the team leader should have taken the information you provided regarding the property being unoccupied and noted the systems accordingly. This one action would have prevented the follow-up letters sent to the property.'

She said Mr Troy's complaint had led to new procedures being put in place to stop the same thing happening again but she admitted Peter felt harassed by the department’s actions.

Cases linked to the Department of Work and Pensions will now be managed with more flexibility.

Capita, an outsourcing company that runs various activities including the Criminal Records Bureau, has often been the subject of controversy.

It was revealed in January that Capita had misinformed people that they had to leave the UK as they had no valid visa.

And many schools once had to delay the school year because the CRB could not cope with the number of teachers who had to be cleared.

A TV Licensing spokesperson said: 'We take any complaints very seriously and when mistakes happen we try to correct them as quickly as possible. We have written to Mr Troy to offer our apologies and to make a goodwill gesture.

'We have since provided extra training to a specialist team, taking into account there may be unusual and sometimes distressing circumstances.'
