A former Nazi soldier is to demand compensation at the High Court claiming he was tortured by British interrogators using ‘Gestapo methods’ after the Second World War.

Gerhard Menzel, 89, was arrested in Hamburg in June 1946 by British intelligence officials who suspected he was a Communist spy.

He was taken to the British-run Bad Nenndorf prison near Hanover where he claims to have been tortured with thumb and shin screws seized from a Gestapo cellar.

Gerhard Menzel, 89, is taking his claim to the High Court after he said he was tortured while imprisoned at Bad Nenndorf by the British

Mr Menzel says he was also punched in 
the face, had his hands chained behind his back for up to 16 days at a 
time and was drenched in iced water every half an hour, according to magazine Focus.

He said he is taking legal action now, almost 70 years after the event, because he is the jail’s last surviving prisoner.

The engineer, from Lindau in South Germany, will have his case heard at the High Court in what is thought to be the first ever claim from a representative of the Nazi armed forces.

The case is expected to begin next month. Mr Menzel said: ‘I deserve to be financially compensated for what I suffered. Prime Minister David Cameron will understand me. He is a gentleman.’

Former Nazis, members of the SS, associates of Adolf Hitler and suspected Communists were interrogated by the British at Bad Nenndorf between June 1945 and July 1947. It is claimed mock executions were held at the facility, and several inmates committed suicide or died from hunger or exhaustion.

Locals claimed to hear screams coming from the prison which became known as das verbotene dorf – the forbidden village.

The treatment of 372 men and 44 women prisoners led to an investigation by a Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Tom Hayward.

Four of Bad Nenndorf’s officers were brought before a court-martial in 1948. One was convicted on charges of neglect. Mr Menzel, who is 6ft, was 23 when he was arrested. Documents show he was 10st 3lb then, but after eight months at Bad Nenndorf he was 7st 10lb.

He was transferred to another British-run camp where a doctor noted he was ‘only skin and bones’ and his chances of survival were slim.

The notes from the doctors add: ‘He could neither walk nor stand up without assistance, and could only speak with difficulty because his tongue and lips were swollen and broken open.’

Mr Menzel was one of 12 inmates transferred from Bad Nenndorf. All were described as being emaciated and dressed in rags. Previous arrivals had also been half-starved according to notes taken at the time, and some had scars apparently as a result of beatings and torture with shin screws.

Mr Menzel said: ‘Anything I win would be a token towards acknowledging that hundreds of other people were cruelly and senselessly tortured in this place.

‘It is a long time in coming. They said I was a Communist spy, but it was rubbish. I was a victim of paranoia about Stalin.’
