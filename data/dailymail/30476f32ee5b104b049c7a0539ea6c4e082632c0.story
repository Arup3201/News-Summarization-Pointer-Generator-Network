Kate Bosworth looked every inch the elegant bride in an ivory satin strapless gown when she tied the knot with Michael Polish in Philipsburg, Montana on Saturday.

Now,
in newly-released Vogue  footage from fittings with her wedding dress 
designer Oscar de la Renta, we see the 30-year-old's emotional reaction the first time she saw herself in her gown.

'Seeing the dress I was totally shocked at my complete lack of control over my emotions in that moment,' she said.

Emotional moment: Kate Bosworth is pictured in her finished wedding gown for the first time in Oscar de la Renta's New York studio

Tearful: The actress said she was surprised at how emotional she became on seeing herself in the gown

'It's a dress that reflects the love I have for my partner, it's a reflection on my life, it's a reflection on the woman I've become.'

The two videos, one from a toile fitting, and one with the finished dress, offer a detailed look at the actress's dramatic gown, and tell the story of how it came to be.

'Because I love minimalism and I love a 
clean line so much, I knew that I didn’t want any embellishments in the 
dress,' Ms Bosworth said. 'So I spoke to Oscar [and] he loved the idea about 
having the drama in the back. So I knew that was going to be perfect.'

She says that the length of the train, which is 8ft long and 16ft wide,  was a later decision - an idea that came about during the toile fitting.

Making changes: The length of the train, which is 8ft long and 16ft wide, was a later decision - an idea that came about during the toile fitting

'When we first tried on
the muslin, the train was a bit shorter, and we all felt that because 
it was such a restrained look, that we could go with more length and a 
little bit more drama,' she said.

'The
veil is actually a cathedral length veil, traditionally a cathedral 
length veil moves even further past the end of the dress, but we 
proportioned it to the dress.'

The result was an overwhelming success.

'I love the dress because when you see the front, it feels so 
minimal then when you turn around there's just this dramatic sort of 
glorious fall of the fabric,' the actress says.

'It looks like it has weight and a heaviness to it, but yet it feels light as air. There's just so much poetry and elegance to it.'

Minimalist: The actress wanted the dress to be restrained in the front, with clean lines

Statement: The back, however, was all drama, with fabric cascading into a cathedral-length train

At the final fitting for her dress, Ms Bosworth also selected her accessories from a vintage-look selection by jeweler Stephen Russell.

'Because
my dress is so restrained and has such a minimal feel to it, I thought,
oh the embellishment should really shine, and the jewelry,' she said. 'Still in a 
subtle way so that the look is fluid. . . It 
was really difficult to choose because they're all so beautiful.'

Ms Bosworth, who is seen
greeting the fashion designer with a kiss on both cheeks, says 
she is honored that he agreed to design her dress,

'Oscar is the most legendary designer, 
in my opinion, ever,' she says in the clip. 'He has such a great mark 
on American elegance, and I’m such an admirer of his life and his work. 
There is no one else for me.'

In turn, Mr de la Renta says he is delighted to have been tasked with the job.

'I am extremely honored that you chose me,' he says. 'It's probably the most special day in any woman's life, so I'm very excited to be involved in this.'

Like any other bride-to-be, the actress seemed as though she couldn't wait to open up about her wedding plans.

'Michael
and I talk about this a lot - I think there's two ways that we'll both 
go it'll either be very emotional or we'll just kinda start laughing. . . ' 
she said.

Couture creation: Ms Bosworth married Michael Polish in her dramatic Oscar de la Renta gown on Saturday

Happy couple: The actress said at the fitting before her big day that she already feels like Mrs Polish, so the dress is just the frosting on the cake

'It's
so exciting, I'm so excited to talk about it. I already 
feel like Mrs Polish so the dress does feel like the frosting, or the 
cherry.'

With 
the help of de la Renta's master tailor Raffaele Ilardo, she and Mr de la Renta came up 
with the perfect creation.

The
trio are also seen discussing fabric texture and color in the video - a
decision that was 'incredibly important' because 'we 
needed to have enough softness in order to find the folds of the 
fabric.'

Ms Bosworth clearly seemed besotted with her future husband as she described her plans for the rest of the day.

Excited: The actress seemed as though she couldn't wait to open up about her wedding plans

'The moment I met Michael, I knew 
that he was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with,' she said.

'We're best friends and great partners and I just found my match in this 
life - and so every detail in the wedding is a reflection of our union.'

She added that they chose to marry in Montana because it is a place they both love and 'feel incredibly at home.'

Her hope for the dress, she said, was that it would 'be fluid in that landscape.'

Ms Bosworth's strapless gown was worn with a veil, tiara and crystal-studded Jimmy Choo heels on the day itself.

 In lieu of traditional vows, she and Mr Polish penned their own romantic words, according to Martha Stewart Weddings - which helped organize the nuptials.

The couple's wedding planning team - which also included The Ranch at Rock Creek general manager Maja 
Kilgore - created a theme that combined Victorian English with the American Old West.

The groom's 15-year-old daughter, 
Jasper, was part of the ceremony that took place overlooking Montana's 
hilltops, streams and mountains.

Afterwards, guests enjoyed a locally-sourced dinner at Granite Lodge, for which the actress changed into a floral embroidered tulle dress.

Guests included actress Lake Bell, Oscar-winning actor-and-producer Walton Goggins and Michael's twin brother Mark Polish.

The four-day celebration was snapped 
by photographer John Dolan and the wedding will be featured in the 
Winter issue of Martha Stewart Weddings.

The pair met when he directed Kate in the drama Big Sur in 2011 and the actress has admitted that it was love at first sight.

Talking
to InStyle earlier this year, Kate revealed: 'I never even dated my 
husband-to-be. . . He said to me after just a few weeks before we were 
even together, "I'm going to marry you." He just knew.'
