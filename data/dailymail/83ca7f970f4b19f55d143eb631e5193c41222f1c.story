He might look like an extra member of Daft Punk, but Russia’s robot humanoid is set to be joining astronauts aboard the International Space Station as early as next year.

Scientists at the Gagarin Cosmonauts' Training Centre in Star City Centre, just outside Moscow, have shown off their creation, called SAR-401.

Russia is working on its own version of Nasa’s Robonaut, which is already lending a hand on the International Space Station – so the two robots might work together in the future.

Russia's SAR-401robot humanoid could be joining astronauts aboard the International Space Station as early as next year

A slightly earlier model called SAR-400 is scheduled to be blasted into space in 2014.

Russia’s robonaut is similar to Nasa’s as it is not designed to be completely autonomous but is operated remotely from the ground, Spectrum reported.

A Russian scientist demonstrated how by putting on a pair of specially designed gloves, he is able to control the robot’s arms and hands, which are based on a human’s and can perform delicate tasks.

The robot can lift up to 10 kilograms on Earth, though it will be able to lift more than that in a zero-gravity environment. It is capable of operating inside or outside the space station.

Oleg Gordiyenko, science directorate deputy head at the Gagarin Cosmonauts' Training Centre Research Institute, said: ‘It's to perform operations both aboard the ISS and outside.

‘Scientists' plans envision introducing robots in manned cosmonautics. This is a promising avenue of research for coming years.’

The robonaut's hands are capable of manipulating small items and lifting heavy objects

The robot has been built by Android Technics and the company’s executive director, Vladislav Sychkov, said: ‘We have completed R&D for the development of the robot’s new key assembly unit, which is a "shoulder" with three degrees of freedom.

‘We’re also working on a new pickup and gripping system. All this is expected to result in the creation of a prototype of a multifunctional space robot.’

He told Russian publication RIA Novosti (via Marchmont Innovation News) there is no need for the robot to have legs and it focuses on a torso and two  ‘manipulator arms’ as well as a head module.

Nasa's Robonaut 2 also has hands, upper body and a head, which has cameras that work like eyes

SAR-400 is planned to join Nasa’s Robonaut 2 at the International Space Station, which has also been built to look a little like a person.

Robonaut 2 also has a head, upper body and hands. Its head has cameras that work like eyes, as well as moving fingers that can manipulate the same tools as astronauts.

The robot can lift up to 10 kilograms on Earth, but this translates into lifting objects that weigh more in space, as the robot is designed to be able to work outside the space station too

Its upper body can be placed on different lower halves, including a set of wheels.

The robot works in two ways: It either receives a simple job to do and uses an onboard computer to work out how to perform the task, or can be run by remote control by a person wearing a headset, who can see what the robots sees and then control it from Earth.

Robonaut is a humanoid robotic development project conducted by the Dextrous Robotics Laboratory at Nasa's Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas.

It is designed to work alongside astronauts and has dexterous hands to use space tools and work in similar environments suited to astronauts.

Robonaut 2 is capable of speeds more than four times faster than the first model, is more compact, more dexterous and includes a deeper and wider range of sensing.

There are over 350 sensors and 38 PowerPC processors in the robot. Station crew members can operate R2, as well as controllers on the ground using 'telepresence,' which is a set of technologies that allow a person to feel as if they are present at a place other than their true location, using telerobotics.

The robot doesn't have to be fully supervised and can carry out tasks autonomously with supervision checks.

While not all human range of motion and sensitivity has been duplicated, the robot's hand has 12 degrees of freedom as well as 2 degrees of freedom in wrist. The R2 model also uses touch sensors at the tips of its fingers.

The robot arrived on the International Space Station on August 22, 2011.

Further upgrades could be added to allow R2 to work outside in the vacuum of space, where R2 could help space walkers perform repairs, make additions to the station or conduct scientific experiments.
