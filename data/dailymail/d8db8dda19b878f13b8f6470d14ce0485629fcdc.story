Harry Kane scored and Tottenham capitulated in the second half. Mauricio Pochettino must have thought it was Groundhog Day.

Cruising at 2-0, Spurs produced an utterly inept second half display as Asteras Tripolis wasted a glut of clear cut chances as the Londoners were made to sweat on their three points when the game looked all but won.

Pochettino had a face like thunder as he stormed off the pitch back to the dressing room after the final whistle, hardly the demeanour of a manager whose side just won.

And no wonder as his side threatened to throw, what should have been a routine win, away.

On the plus side for the Argentine, Harry Kane scored… again.

Surely, the forward will think it's personal if he doesn't start against Stoke on Sunday.

What more does he have to do? He took his tally to 10 goals in this Europa League  win.

His first league start of the season  against Mark Hughes' men must surely be a certainty now.

Tottenham made nine changes for Thursday night's clash, with Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen the only survivors from Sunday's last-gasp win over Aston Villa.

That meant another chance for man-of-the-moment  Kane to persuade Pochettino that he should be the man to lead Tottenham's so far misfiring strike force.

Around 300 or so hardy souls made their to the Arcadian outpost for the clash that would see Spurs take a giant step towards qualification for the next round with victory.

The encounter has been billed as the biggest night in Asteras Tripolis' history. If that was the case, then it certainly didn't feel that way.

The crowd, in the 7,500 capacity Theodoros Kolokotronis Stadium, were subdued. As were their team as Spurs took control of the opening 10 minutes without creating a clear-cut chance.

And slowly, Asteras felt their way into proceedings, awakening from their early slumber.

Giorgios Zisopoulos sent a towering header from Fernando Usero's corner just wide in the 15th minute before Ben Davies had a weak penalty appeal rejected afar a tangle with Khalifa Sankare in the box.

Suddenly the home crowd started to perk up, and their team responded; Sankare flicking a header narrowly wide after Martin Rolle's well-flighted free-kick.

Then Pablo Mazza missed the best chance of the opening 30 minutes, miscuing a strike from a good position 15 yards out wide of Michel Vorm's far post following good work from Juan Munafo.

But Spurs were handed a lifeline in the 36th minute when Sankare launched himself at Andros Townsend in the box.

The Asteras central-defender looked to have taken at least some of the ball, but Spanish referee Javier Estrada pointed to the spot, much to Sankare's disbelief.

And Townsend picked himself up to fire the resultant spot-kick past Tomas Kosicky into the top right-hand corner.

The goal was exactly what Tottenham needed after a less than convincing start, and so it proved as they doubled their lead three minutes before the break.

And it was the simplest of goals, too, Townsend, with the freedom of the left-hand side, firing in a pinpoint cross to allow Kane to nod home from close range for his 10th of the season.

It surely can't be long before Pochettino succumbs to supporter pressure and finally hand Kane the Premier League start he rightfully deserves.

The Spurs academy graduate, however, showed his human on the stroke of half-time somehow contriving to hit the bar from a yard out following Eric Dier's low cross - though his blushes were spared by an offside flag.

Tottenham were in full control, but the way they started the second period had Pochettino fuming in his technical area.

Less than 30 seconds after the restart, Tasos Tsokanis fired Rolle's pass wide with just Vorm to beat.

Kane has now scored 10 goals in all competitions for Spurs this season so far following his header against Asteras

Rolle then fired wide narrowly wide from distance before Federico Fazio's dalliance on the ball caused further chaos in the Spurs box.

Asteras were carving Spurs open at will, Rolle missing two guild-edged chances with just Vorm in front of him following poor defending from captain Vertonghen and Fazio.

Pochettino was furious, the wounds from the way his side surrendered their 1-0 lead against Newcastle last month just eight seconds into the restart far from healed.

And Asteras kept coming, Mazza firing straight at Vorm when he should really have done better before he hit the post with an excellent right-footed strike.

Vorm then produced then produced two brilliant saves to first deny Zisopoulos's instinctive volley and then substitute Ziguy Badibanga's. 

And a night that was running smoothly ended in chaos as Fazio bundled down substitute Jeronimo Barrales in the box to gift the Greeks a penalty in the first minute of stoppage time and caused the visitors to finish the game with 10 men as the Italian saw red.

Barrales slotted home the penalty to set-up a grandstand finale before Badibanga thought he clinched a dramatic draw, but his header hit the side netting when home supporters thought the ball had nestled on the other side of the post.

And breathe, Spurs fans.
