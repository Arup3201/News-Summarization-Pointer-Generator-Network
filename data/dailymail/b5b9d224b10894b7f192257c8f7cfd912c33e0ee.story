Television history was made yesterday as cameras were allowed into court to film the moment a murderer was sentenced to life in prison.

It was the first time that cameras had recorded the sentencing of a killer in a British court.

But the cameraman was not permitted to film murderer David Gilroy himself, who was convicted last month of killing his ex-lover Suzanne Pilley.

Days from death: The CCTV image shows Suzanne Pilley shopping with murderer David Gilroy in 2010. Within 48 hours she had died at his hand

Instead, the footage focused solely on the judge, Lord Bracadale, as he handed Gilroy a mandatory life sentence.

A single television camera, set up in the empty jury box, recorded his statement.

At the High Court in Edinburgh he told Gilroy, whose victim’s body has 
not been found: ‘It seems that you are the only person who knows where 
her body is.

‘I hope that a day will come in your life when you will feel able to 
disclose that information and that might bring some comfort to her 
bereft family.’

The historic move to allow the recording was the result of a successful 
application by Scottish broadcaster STV, which argued it would be in the
public interest.

Legal history: Gilroy's sentencing at the High Court in Edinburgh today was the first to be televised in Britain. Cameras focussed on Lord Bracadale. The defendant was not allowed to be filmed

Marker: There are plans for more cases from British courtrooms to be televised

Filming is currently banned in criminal court hearings in England and 
Wales, though this ban is expected to be lifted later this year 
following an announcement in the Queen’s Speech in May.

Hearings at Westminster’s Supreme Court, the UK’s highest court, are 
already broadcast live and cameras have been allowed in Scottish courts 
since 1992.

But their presence has been very rare – restricted to a few high-profile
appeal court cases, including that of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset 
al-Megrahi in 2002.

Before yesterday’s sentencing, the court had heard 
that Miss Pilley, 38, a respected and well-liked book-keeper from 
Edinburgh, ‘just disappeared’ after making her way to the city centre 
office she shared with Gilroy on May 4, 2010.

Pilley (right)

Jealous Gilroy, 49, confronted her before she reached her desk about her
decision to end their relationship, then snapped and killed her.

The ‘deceitful and controlling’ killer maintained a front of normality, 
then drove her body to a secret grave, believed to be in remote Argyll.

Lord Bracadale told Gilroy: ‘The evidence indicated that, having 
confronted her over her decision to end the relationship, you lost your 
temper and murdered her in a sustained attack.’

Unable to grieve properly: Miss Pilley's parents, Sylvia and Robert (above), arrive at court for sentencing this morning. They have pleaded with Gilroy to reveal where their daughter's body is buried

The judge added: ‘The evidence showed that after murdering Suzanne 
Pilley, you immediately embarked on an elaborate plan to dispose of her 
body and avoid detection. With quite chilling calmness and calculation, 
you successfully disposed of the body, apparently somewhere in Argyll.’

Gilroy, who maintains his innocence, showed no emotion as he was led away amid angry shouts from the packed courtroom.

Miss Pilley’s parents, Sylvia and Rob, who attended court, said that 
although they were comforted to know justice had been done, they would 
not be able to rest completely until they knew where their ‘devoted’ 
daughter was.
