The club where Real Madrid superstar James Rodriguez made his breakthrough have been blacklisted by the US Treasury for being a front for a drug cartel.

Envigado FC of the Colombian top flight have been placed of the 'Kingpin List' by the US Treasury for supporting a cartel known as 'La Oficina de Envigado'.

Rodriguez, who signed for Real in a £60million deal this summer, came through the club's academy and made his debut for their first-team aged just 15 in 2007.

The club have had their US assets frozen and American citizens have been banned from dealing with the club while they are blacklisted.

President Ramiro Ruiz insisted Envigado are an 'open book' in a calm response to the news.

'We are an open book,' he said. 'Like all teams Colombia we are regulated by the Superintendency of Companies.

'We are calm, we stand firm and have all the answers to any question of the entities that require us.'
