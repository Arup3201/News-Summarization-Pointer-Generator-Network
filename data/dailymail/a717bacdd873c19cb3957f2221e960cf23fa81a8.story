An old man dying of lung cancer and Parkinson’s disease was touched in his final months by an online campaign organized by his family, which generated more than 3,500 responses from people in over 100 countries.

Brian Curtis, who lived in the remote Nebraska town of Harvard, found out that he had terminal lung cancer in April 2012, when doctors told him that he had six months to live – ‘plus or minus three months.’

The news of his father’s terminal illness had a major impact on son Brandon Curtis, 30, who works as international digital brand manager at Red Bull.

He, along with the rest of the family, was still reeling from the unexpected loss of oldest sister Jana who had died from an undetected heart virus just eight months prior.

‘None of us had the chance to say goodbye,’ Brandon told Mashable. ‘When we found out about my dad's terminal cancer, we were going to do anything it took to show him how much we loved him and to say goodbye.’ 

Brandon and family decide to launch #SkyBluePink, an online campaign they hoped would help bring some happiness to their father in his final days.

The campaign was named after Brian's favorite color - one that his mom had used to describe the color of the sky at sunrise and dusk.

‘We ask you to help fill his life with love, support and #SkyBluePink’ by sending a card, tweeting a note on Twitter or sharing a photo on Instagram, read a message posted by Brandon to announce their heart-warming project.

Friends and family spread the word about the project via their social media channels.

Soon strangers from more than 100 
countries had sent in images via social media or snail mail to comfort 
this man they had never meet.

A week after the launch, Brandon told his father about the project and how they had received 500 submissions in just 168 hours.

'It was enough to cover an entire wall at his hospice care center,' said Brandon.

He recalls
his father ‘crying with pride and disbelief' as family members would 
read Brian messages he had received from far flung locations such as 
Germany and Australia.

As the months passed, Brian underwent 
radiation to combat tumors that were spreading through his ribs, 
shoulders, lymph nodes, lungs and spine.

By Christmas, the family had received 2,700 #SkyBluePink submissions and photographs showed Brian lying in his hospice bed surrounded by shades of blue and pink, emanating from wall-mounted photos, paintings, messages and cards.

He requested that Brandon share his message online: 'It's just amazing. I can’t get over how so many people have taken time out of their days to capture and send SkyBluePink to me. From all over. All ages ... People I've never met.'

Then on August 12, Brandon received the call he had been dreading from his sister Cindy. His father didn’t have long left and he rushed to Nebraska from his home in Los Angeles in the hope of seeing his father and speaking to him one more time.

By now his room was covered with more than 3,500 #SkyBluePink cards, paintings, photos and even elementary school art projects from 105 countries.

Brandon got to sit with his father one last time and hold his hand, before Brian passed away hours later on August 13.

Later in the day, Brandon posted a message on Facebook to break the sad news and offer thanks to the #SkyBluePink community.

‘Dad passed away this afternoon. He was comfortable, happy, courageous. Our family wanted to thank you all so very much for taking the time to help us give him a proper #SkyBluePink send off today.

'As we looked around the world, because of you. This means more than you will ever know. We love you dad. You are amazing,' he wrote.

A month later at a memorial service for their father on Sept. 14 memorial service, Brandon spoke about  #SkyBluePink and what it had meant to his father.

'I really think [#SkyBluePink] did play a role in him beating the doctor's expectations,' said Brandon. 'Sky Blue Pink' will always mean love.'

The success of #SkyBluePink is a striking reminder - despite what people say about technology and social media making us less personal - that people still care and social platforms have the potential to bring the world together.
