Surrounded by some of the friends and family he allegedly gunned down, the first picture has emerged of the man suspected of killing at least 13 people, including a child, in a quiet village in rural Serbia.

After the rampage Ljubisa Bogdanovic, a 60-year-old who saw action in one of the bloodiest sieges of the Balkan wars, turned the gun on himself when confronted by police. He is now in a critical condition in hospital.

His wife was also seriously injured and another person was also hurt in the atrocity in the village of Velika Ivanca, 30 miles southeast of the capital Belgrade. Terrified residents said if a police patrol car hadn't shown up, they all would have been dead.

Milorad Veljovic, the head of the national police force, said Bogdanovic first killed his 42-year-old son Branko in the head in their home.

He then wounded his wife before killing 
12 neighbors, some of whom were still asleep, in four nearby homes, 
Veljovic said in an interview with state broadcaster RTS.

Among the reported dead are Mikailo 
and Milena Despotovic, their grandson Goran, his 19-year-old wife Jovana
 and their two-year-old son.

In the
 small lush village surrounded by fruit trees, the suspect's older 
brother Radmilo broke down in tears, unable to explain why the massacre 
had happened.

'Why did he do it? ... I still can't believe it,' he said sobbing, covering his face with his hands. 'He was a model of honesty.

'As a child, he was a frightened 
little boy. I used to defend him from other children. He couldn't even 
slaughter a chicken,' he said.

But he said his brother had changed 
after serving in the army during a brutal Serb-led offensive against the
 eastern Croatian town of Vukovar in 1992 - the worst bloodshed during 
Croatia's 1991-95 war for independence.

'The war had burdened him,' Radmilo 
told The Associated Press in an interview. 'He used to tell me: "God 
forbid you live through what I went through" ... Something must have 
clicked in his head for him to do this.'

Twelve people in the village were killed immediately between 5 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. and one person died later in a Belgrade hospital, Veljovic said.

'Most of the victims were shot while they were asleep,' Veljovic told reporters. 'The most harrowing scene discovered by police was the dead bodies of a young mother and her two-year-old son.'

The suspect had lost his job last year at a wood-processing factory, the police chief said.

Residents expressed deep shock, describing the suspect as a nice, quiet man.

'He knocked on the doors and as they were opened he just fired a shot,' said villager Radovan Radosavljevic.

'He was a good neighbor and anyone would open their doors to him. I don't know what happened.'

'I never saw him angry, ever,' said 
Milovan Kostadinovic, another resident. 'He was helping everybody, he 
had a car and drove us everywhere.'

Unconfirmed reports said that the shooter had a permit for the weapon used in the attack, which means that it could not have been an automatic firearm

A group of police officers cordoned off the village. The shooter is believed to be a war veteran and is reported to have lost his job last year

Many Serbs own guns guns, which are readily available mostly from the war in the Balkans in the 1990s

Still, neighbors said an entire five-member family was shot dead in one house, including the small boy who was the suspected killer's cousin.

Kostadinovic said the suspect was confronted by police while en route to his house.

'If they didn't stop him, he would have wiped us all out,' Kostadinovic said, standing in front of his two-story, red tile- roofed house. 'He shot himself when police stopped him.'

His wife Stanica said their small white-and-brown dog Rocky had gotten very nervous early in the morning and was barking and jumping up and down. She said when her husband opened their door, a policewoman shouted: 'Get back in!'.

'He was shooting everybody. Police saved us,' she said.

The suspected killer owned a gun but neighbors and his brother said he never hunted or shot weapons, even at weddings or celebrations as is traditional in the Balkans.

'He was quiet as a bug,' Stanica Kostadinovic said.

Nada Macura, a Belgrade hospital spokeswoman, said the suspect had no known history of mental illness.

Stanica Kostadinovic, the neighbor, said the man's father had hanged himself when he was a young boy and his uncle had a history of mental illness.

Police blocked off the village while forensic teams and investigators in white protective robes took evidence from homes where the shootings took place.

Doctors said later the suspect's condition was critical but his wife was able to communicate with the hospital staff.

Tragic: A two-year-old boy was one of the slain, said Serbian police director Milorad Veljovic

Veteran: Bogdanovic is reported to have fought in the war between Croatia and Serbia in the 1990s

Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said 
the killings showed that the government must pay more attention to gun 
control and other social problems facing the Balkan nation, which is 
still reeling from the 1990s wars.

Initial reports said the alleged killer had a license for the handgun he used in the shootings since 1981.

The government held an emergency 
session and was expected to proclaim a national day of mourning.

Although such apparent random shootings 
are rare in Serbia, weapons are readily available mostly from the war in
 the Balkans in the 1990s and there is a tradition of possessing 
firearms.

Serbia's last big shooting spree occurred in 2007, when a 39-year-old 
man gunned down nine people and injured two others in the eastern 
village of Jabukovac.
