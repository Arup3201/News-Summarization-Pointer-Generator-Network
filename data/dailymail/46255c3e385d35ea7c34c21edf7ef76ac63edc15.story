The Georgia Department of Public Health is facing a federal complaint from a man who allegedly suffered religious discrimination when his job offer was rescinded.

'I was shocked at what happened,' complainant Dr. Eric Walsh told WSBTV. 'I didn't know in the United States of America that something like this could happen when your work record is stellar.'

The doctor and lay minister made remarks on both evolution and homosexuality in his video sermons, the affiliate station reported.

'If two adults agree to do something, then it's not wrong, because they're both consenting adults,' Walsh said in one clip obtained by the station. 'That is - that is doctrine from the pits of hell.'

In another, he said '...Because of evolution and this Satanic belief that man evolved from lesser beings.'

In a sermon titled 'Culture, Sex and the Fight for Purity,' Walsh argued the devil used television to increase acceptance of gay marriage. 

Those videos are the reason Walsh is not employed with the Department of Public Health, Walsh told WSBTV.

The Los Angeles Times reported the videos emerged in the wake of a decision by Pasadena City College to name Walsh its 2013 commencement speaker over a gay candidate. 

Because of the videos, Walsh, who at the time served as Pasadena's Public Health Director, was first on administrative leave before he eventually resigned,The Pasadena Star-News reported.

Walsh came under fire from both AIDS and LGBT groups, who contacted the Georgia Department of Health to complain when Walsh was initially hired, the newspaper reported. 

In May, Georgia Department of Public Health spokesman Ryan Deal said 'Today’s action by the department follows a thorough examination of Dr. Walsh’s credentials and background as well as consultation with the six local boards of health which comprise the district' in a statement.

Attorney Jeremy Dys told WSBTV Tuesday 'If what you say in church is going to be held accountable by your employer and is going to come up on your annual review, then we’ve got real problems in this country.

'It is illegal in this country to fire someone because of their faith. That’s what the Georgia Public Health Department has done here.' 

'The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) withdrew Dr. Eric Walsh’s conditional offer of employment in May 2014 for reasons entirely unrelated to his beliefs,' the department said in a statement sent to MailOnline by a spokesman. 'DPH will respond to the EEOC complaint as soon as possible.'
