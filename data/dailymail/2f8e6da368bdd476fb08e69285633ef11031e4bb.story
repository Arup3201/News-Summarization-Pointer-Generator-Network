He has been taken to an east London hospital where he is in a serious but stable condition.

He was initially described as being critical but a police spokesman said this had been downgraded to a serious condition 'not believed to be life-threatening'.

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'We were called at 5.45pm today to reports of a man being assaulted in Gloucester Road in Tottenham.

'Ourselves and the ambulance service attended the scene. That male, believed to be aged 16, was taken to an east London hospital suffering from stab wounds.

'No arrests have been made at this stage and enquiries continue.'

Unrest: The death of Broadwater Farm resident Mark Duggan sparked riots in Tottenham (pictured) which then spread to other parts of London

There is no suggestion that today's incident is connected to the problems in the area last month.

However, the estate has been linked with violence in the past.

The Broadwater Farm estate was the home of Mark Duggan, the self-styled 'gangster' whose death by police marksman sparked the Tottenham riots last month which then spread to other parts of London.

Mr Duggan was an 'elder' from the estate - a phrase used to describe people who are well-known and respected by residents.

Broadwater Farm was also the 
scene of violent riots that led to the horrific death of police officer Keith Blakelock in 
1985.

The PC was hacked to death by a mob wielding knives, swords and machetes amid unrest on the estate.
