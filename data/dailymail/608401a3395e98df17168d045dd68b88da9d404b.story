Pepe Reina will sign his contract at Bayern Munich on Friday after passing his medical at the club.

The goalkeeper has passed his medical at the training ground after Liverpool agreed to sell the Spaniard for £2million.

Reina had fallen out of favour in recent years at Anfield and spent a year on loan at Napoli last season.

Bayern Munich tweeted on Thursday night: Welcome to Munich @PReina25! Medical successfully completed, contract to be signed tomorrow.

Reina was a regular in the Liverpool side after arriving from Villarreal in 2006, playing in a Champions League final along the way.

But after Brendan Rodgers brought in Sunderland goalkeeper last season, the writing was on the wall.

Reina impressed in his year at Napoli where he continued to ply his trade in Europe, and will now compete with Germany No 1 Manuel Neuer for a starting spot.
