Dozens of senior politicians are involved in a  controversial ‘back-door  subsidy’ through which political parties and trade unions have been handed almost £4million of taxpayers’ money.

Nick Clegg, Francis Maude and Jeremy Hunt were named yesterday among almost 250 MPs who funnel public money to their parties by renting offices from their local constituency associations. Roughly one-third of all MPs have been involved since the election.

Ed Miliband’s policy chief Jon Cruddas and frontbenchers Luciana Berger and Kevin Brennan are among a number of Labour MPs who have rented their offices from trade unions using public money. In many cases the unions have donated cash to the MPs concerned.

Hundreds of MPs have been using taxpayer-funded expenses to rent offices from their own parties. The arrangements are within the rules but will now be reviewed

On average, the rents charged by constituency parties are  higher than those charged by private sector landlords used by other MPs.

The highest Cabinet claimant is Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who has billed the taxpayer £43,232 to rent an office from his local party.

The figure is three times the £14,156 average claimed by MPs who rented from private landlords and the money has gone to  Kingston Lib Dems. It could be used to help Mr Davey fight  for re-election..

Big Tory claimers include Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, who has billed the taxpayer £32,187 to rent an office from his constituency association in Horsham.

All the figures represent total claims since the election.

In total, the deals involve more than £3.7million of public money being diverted to political parties and unions since the election. Members of the Cabinet have claimed almost £300,000 between them.

The arrangements are within the 
expenses rules, but critics say it  gives sitting MPs an unfair 
advantage over their rivals, who do not enjoy what amounts to a subsidy 
from the taxpayer.

The 
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) yesterday announced
it would review the arrangements to see if the rules need to be 
changed.

‘Our rules allow MPs to rent from a political party,’ said chairman Sir Ian Kennedy. ‘But we require an extra assurance from MPs if they do so: an independent valuation that the lease represents the market rate.

‘As part of a broad review of accommodation support, Ipsa will consider whether, even if the individual leases are appropriate, the cumulative effect means we need to reconsider this aspect of the rules.’

On average, those renting from their local parties claimed about 5 per cent more. Ipsa said the difference between the cost of the leases was one of the things it would be looking at in its review.

Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the existing rules were unacceptable. ‘It’s one thing if a local political party offers their MP free use of an office, but quite another for it to be sending taxpayers an annual invoice for thousands of pounds,’ he said.

‘Often this is space that would not in any case be available to anyone else on commercial terms.

‘It’s effectively a back-door subsidy to political parties that is exploiting an allowance meant to assist MPs in their work serving their constituents, not boost the coffers of their re-election campaign.’

He described it as ‘little more than a sneaky way of channelling taxpayers’ cash into party coffers’.

Sir Ian Kennedy, Chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said the watchdog would look again at the rules

Ipsa said 244 MPs have claimed expenses for constituency offices rented off their local party since the election.

Another ten Labour MPs have rented offices from unions, including six who have arrangements with Unite, Labour’s biggest donor.

Mr Cruddas has claimed £20,475 since the election for an office he rents from Unite. Since becoming an MP he has received £156,742 in donations from the union.

MPs who have been involved in constituency office deals since the election include 32 ministers, of whom 14 attend the Cabinet.
