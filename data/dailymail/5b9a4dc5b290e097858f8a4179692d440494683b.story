Angela Merkel will this week give the green light to David Cameron’s attempt to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

On a visit to the UK, the German chancellor will say that she wants to see a new treaty to redraw the rules of the EU – opening the door for the Prime Minister to thrash out a different deal with Brussels.

Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday confirmed that Mrs Merkel is also expected to back two key planks of Mr Cameron’s renegotiation effort, demanding tighter controls over the rights of migrants to claim benefits and greater controls by national parliaments.

‘There are people in many of the Nordic countries who share these ideas,’ he said. ‘In Germany there is a strong overlap of ideas.

‘Germany also has strict benefit rules. We don’t support people moving from one country to another because of the incentives of different benefit systems, and I think with Germany we have a lot of common ground on that.’

Regulations imposed by the Lisbon Treaty will end up costing British business nearly £100billion, a report claims today.

Eurosceptic pressure group Business for Britain says that rules introduced in December 2009 have already cost £12.2billion.

It claims the final cost to UK business of laws that can be directly attributed to the Lisbon Treaty will amount to £96.5billion.

The report, which uses government impact assessments before the regulations were introduced to calculate potential costs, finds that a law that requires car manufacturers to comply with new EU standards for emissions has cost UK businesses up to £7.4billion.

Rules requiring firms to cut their greenhouse gas emissions have cost £3billion.

But pro-European campaign Business for New Europe criticised the report, saying the ‘costs’ are not proven.

Senior sources say Mr Cameron will treat Mrs Merkel ‘like the Queen’ when she arrives on Thursday for what is a state visit in all but name.

The German leader will meet the Queen for tea at Buckingham Palace and is due to give a speech to both Houses of Parliament – an honour almost never accorded to a non-head of state. A minister told the Mail that the Government expects Mrs Merkel to say that she wants to see treaty change in the EU – which will allow Mr Cameron to seek a new relationship ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017 on whether Britain should remain in the EU.

‘We know she wants to be helpful,’ the minister said. ‘She believes there needs to be a new treaty and that’s the chance we need to put these issues on the table.’

A No 10 source added: ‘She wants Britain in. She doesn’t want to be stuck in an embrace of economic death with [French president] Francois Hollande.’

Mr Hague told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘This is a different sort of visit from the French visit [by Mr Hollande] at the end of January. Germany is our most important partner on seeking reform in the EU.’

The diplomatic offensive is also designed to stitch up a deal to ensure the next president of the European Commission, who will replace Jose Manuel Barroso later this year, is someone who is prepared to see Britain get powers back.
