It's official: Missouri plumbers vote too.

Jay Nixon, the Show-Me State's Democratic governor, sent out an embarrassing tweet Tuesday morning as voters queued up to cast their ballots, showing a woman seated at the polls with her butt-crack exposed.

'ARSE-N-ALL' OF DEMOCRACY: Missouri?s governor tweeted this photo of a voter, who may or may not be a plumber, at a polling place Tuesday morning

The guffaw-inducing gaffe quickly went viral, and staffers swapped out the image 19 minutes later.

'Voting in #JCMO this morning,' Nixon tweeted, referring to the state's capital, Jefferson City. 

'Make sure to cast your ballot & make your voice heard #Election2014'

Missouri is holding statewide elections for U.S. House seats, but neither Nixon nor Missouri's U.S. Senators are facing election fights.

Reaction to the original tweet was fast and furious.

Ballot? Check. Pants tight? Check.  Gov. Nixon voted on Tuesday as aides snapped the hilarious photo, and later substituted this one on his Twitter feed

'Plumbers have to vote too, y'know!' one campaign consultant told MailOnline.

'If you leave the polls open long enough in St. Louis, eventually the moon comes out,' wrote a blogger on a conservative-oriented email listserv.

Another weighed in with crack – pun intended – about the 'arse-n-all' of Democracy.

Nixon's office did not respond for requests for comment.

MailOnline isn't holding its breath, but it is checking the tightness of its belt.
