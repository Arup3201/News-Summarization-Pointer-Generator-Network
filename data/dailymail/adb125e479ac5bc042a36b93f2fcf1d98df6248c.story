A child has been photographed dressed up in a costume that resembles a terrorist outfit - complete with a grenade vest and fake gun - as part of Eid celebrations in Pakistan.

In the picture, the young Pakistani boy wears a long-haired wig, beret and military vest and carries on him a fake grenade and toy guns.

He is celebrating with relatives the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice).

The holiday honours the prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his chosen son as an act of submission to God.

According to the scripture, God intervenes at the last minute to replace Abraham's son with a sheep - an act which forms the basis of its modern celebrations.

In remembrance, Muslim faithful will slaughter sheep, cattle, camels and other livestock in an act of sacrifice to show gratitude for their blessings.

They then divide the meat into three equal portions - keeping some of it for themselves, giving a third to the poor and giving the final third to relatives, friends and neighbours.

Sunday marked the start of festivities for Iraqi Shiites and the majority of Indonesians, while Pakistani Muslims started to celebrate the festival on Monday.

The festival is celebrated by all Muslims but it occurs on slightly different days depending on location because it is held according to the Muslim lunar calendar and moon sightings.

Saturday also marked the first time since 1981 that both Muslims and Jews are celebrating major holidays at the same time.

Eid al-Adha coincides with the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur once every 33 years based on their lunar calendars.

Yom Kippur is Judaism's Day of Atonement, when devout Jews ask God to forgive them for their transgressions and refrain from eating and drinking, attending intense prayer services in synagogues. The holiday began at sunset Friday and ended Saturday night.

Pilgrims perform the Stoning of the Devil ritual on the third day of Eid al-Adha in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The ritual is a re-enactment of Abraham's pilgrimage to Mecca
