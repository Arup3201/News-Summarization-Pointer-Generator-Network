In a guest diary column for the Spectator, Pippa shows that she has a rather lively sense of humour

As most authors would confirm, you’re only as good as your last book.

Which is probably why Pippa Middleton has been thinking hard about what she writes next.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, known as much for her shapely derriere as her royal connections, says she has already come up with the perfect follow-up to her book Celebrate!

‘Maybe I should write a sequel and call it Bottoms Up,’ she says in this week’s edition of The Spectator.

‘Now that could be a bestseller.’

In a guest diary column for the magazine, Pippa shows that as well as the shiny smile and glossy mane of a Middleton, she also has a rather lively sense of humour.

She acknowledges that her party-planning book, which she produced in a £400,000 publishing deal, has been widely derided as a bible of the blindingly obvious.

Pippa, 29, seems to know about all the jokes. And she has a few of her own to add.

‘I have been much teased for my book,’ she begins in the Spectator column.

‘Lots of journalists are saying that my advice is glaringly obvious. A spoof Twitter account called @pippatips offers such pearls as “enjoy a glass of water by getting a clean glass and pouring in water from a tap or bottle”.’

She admits the criticism is all good fun but points out that writing a guide means you have to cover the basics.

‘If I were to write a cookery book, for instance, I would be compelled to say that, to make an omelette, you have to break at least one egg. Actually, that’s not a bad idea. Or maybe I should write a sequel and call it Bottoms Up? Now that could be a bestseller.’

The Spectator, an intellectual weekly magazine first published in 1828, might not come to mind as the natural platform for the thoughts of the gal from Bucklebury, widely celebrated as a ‘rear of the year’ contender.

This week, however, she joins the hallowed ranks of previous diarists including Bernard Levin, Auberon Waugh and John Betjeman.

And Pippa really warms to her theme, using the spoof  Twitter account that pokes fun at her as inspiration for some Christmas entertaining tips.

‘Here.... inspired by @pippatips, are my excruciatingly self-evident tips for festive entertaining in the workplace,’ she writes.

‘1: Choose, if you can, a Christmas-themed menu. A turkey, for example, can be perfect for large gatherings.

 ‘2: Don’t not invite any members of staff, as this can cause offence.

‘3: Keep speeches brief and cheerful: Christmas is not a time to talk about redundancies.’

'I have been much teased for my book,' Pippa begins in the Spectator column. Critics have said the Duchess of Cambridge's sister stated 'the obvious' with her party tips

But as well as her tongue-in-cheek advice, her column also gives a glimpse of Christmas chez Middleton, revealing that her father Michael traditionally surprises the family by wearing fancy dress.

‘A couple of Christmases ago he appeared in an inflatable sumo outfit,’ she discloses.

(No prizes for guessing that   such an outfit is available for hire from the Party Pieces company the Middletons run).

The column records variously that she recently landed two grilse on a fly-fishing trip in Berwickshire... that she is planning a running, cycling and kayaking triathlon in New Zealand... and that she apparently has a soft spot for Roger Federer, ‘a man who exudes so much grace and beauty that he inspires anybody with a pulse,’ as she puts it.

Last night those close to Pippa insisted the Spectator article was all her own work, and that she deliberately intended to send herself up.

‘It is completely intentional and good humoured,’ a source told the Daily Mail.

Yesterday Miss Middleton was hard at work at a book signing in Amsterdam for Celebrate, recently slashed to half price in some British outlets and outsold by such great works as the Highway Code and a Tom Daley calendar.

In a knee-length Beulah London peplum dress the colour of a Cadbury’s Dairy Milk wrapper with matching purple suede heels, she posed in front of a store in Haarlem, stacked high with copies of her book.

All these book signings have done wonders for her literacy skills, she confides in her Spectator column. ‘I have finally perfected my signature. It took hours of practising.’
