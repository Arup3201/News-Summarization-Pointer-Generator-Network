The reported iCloud hack, which exposed hundreds of photos of celebrities, has highlighted the dangers of storing files online. 

In particular, actress Mary Winstead complained she had deleted a number of the leaked photos ‘long ago’.

But, many Apple users aren’t aware that removing a photo from a device doesn’t automatically remove it from their cloud account.

If you are concerned about images or files you have stored online, there are steps you can take to delete them from the iCloud and from the device.

When a user takes a photo, it is stored in their Camera Roll, which is a gallery of images that are physically stored on the device. If My Photo Stream is enabled (pictured left), these photos are also stored in the My Photo Stream album (pictured right), which is automatically uploaded to iCloud and other synced devices

Deleting
 photos from the Photo Stream automatically removes them from iCloud. My
 Photo Stream can also be disabled in Settings, iCloud, Photos

Users can also stop photos automatically being uploaded to iCloud, so that future snaps aren’t vulnerable either.

When a user takes a photo on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, it is stored in their Camera Roll.

This is a gallery of images that are physically stored on the device the photo was taken on.

This also includes photos that have been saved from text messages, emails and websites.

By comparison, the My Photo Stream album is in the cloud and syncs will all other connected devices.

If My Photo Stream is enabled, when a photo is taken and saved on the Camera Roll, it is saved in the My Photo Stream album and automatically saved to iCloud.

This means that particular image is synced with every connected device, and will appear those devices' Photo Stream as well.

If the My Photo Stream album doesn't appear, the tool hasn't been activated, or there isn’t an iCloud account connected to that device.

Photos can also be stored on iCloud if a user chooses to back up their Camera Roll to the cloud service.

To remove these images a person must overwrite them with a new backup. This
 involves moving the images from the iPhone or iPad to another device - 
such as a laptop - and then deleting them from the Camera Roll on the 
phone or tablet.

Next time 
the phone is backed up, the existing Camera Roll backup will be replaced
 with the new one, which should have fewer, or no images in it.

Photos are also stored on iCloud if a user backs up the Camera Roll (left). To remove these images, overwrite them with a new backup. This involves moving images from the iPhone to another device, deleting them from the Camera Roll on the phone or tablet, overwriting the backup, and deselecting the Camera Roll option (right)

It
 is possible for users to enhance the security of their documents by 
turning off iCloud through Settings > iCloud on their device when 
they are not using it.

They
 can also turn on two-step verification for their iCloud account.The 
tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the 
password.

To set up two-step verification, go to My Apple ID.Select Manage your Apple ID and sign in, then select Password and Security.

Under Two-Step Verification, select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions.

When
 a user sets up two-step verification, they register one or more trusted
 devices.A trusted device is one that can receive 4-digit verification 
codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone.

Alternatively,
 Camera Roll backup options can be disabled by going to go to Settings, 
iCloud, Storage & Backup and Manage Storage. Select the device and 
turn off Camera Roll backup.

If
 enabled, backup occurs automatically when the device is synced with 
iTunes, or when it’s put on charge and connected to Wi-Fi.

Images on Photo Stream only stay on the iCloud server for 30 days, and the device will only store 1,000 Photo Stream images.

After this point, the photos are automatically deleted. To remove them sooner, open Photo Stream, select the images that need to be removed, and delete them.

This will delete them from the device and iCloud, but also any other devices that the stream has been shared with, or is connected to the same Apple ID, such as friends or family members.

Users can also disable Photo Stream by switching it off in Settings, iCloud, Photos.

Be aware that when a photo is deleted from the Camera Roll, it is not deleted from the devices My Photo Stream album, and therefore is not automatically deleted from iCloud.
