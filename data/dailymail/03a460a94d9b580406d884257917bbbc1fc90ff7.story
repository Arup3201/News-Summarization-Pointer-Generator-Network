Sold: The Roman statue - which depicts Leda and the Swan - has been kept at Aske Hall in North Yorkshire for 300 years and fetched £12.2million at auction

A statue left languishing as ‘just part of the furniture’ by its owners has been sold at auction for £12.2million.

The 4ft 5in marble depiction of Leda and the Swan had been in the family of the Marquess of Zetland for more than 200 years – and may even have spent some time as a garden ornament.

But no one thought to have it valued until it was spotted by an antiquities specialist at the family seat of Aske Hall, North Yorkshire.

He found it dated to second century Imperial Rome, and estimated its value at £1.2million. But when it was finally sold in New York it prompted a bidding war and went for ten times that.

A source at the hall said: 'The family knew it was old and that it was Roman but they had no idea of its true value.'

So unaware of the statue's pedigree was the Marquess and his family that it spent decades outside masquerading as a garden ornament before it was finally taken inside for good around 40 years ago.

The sculpture was one of four antiquities bought in Rome by the 1st Earl on behalf of his father.

It does not appear in any of the major surveys of ancient marble sculpture in English country houses, but is mentioned in Robinson’s Guide to Richmond of 1833.

Aske Hall has an impressive collection of historic furniture, paintings and porcelain.

The most prized of the ancient antiquities bought in Rome by the 1st Earl - a statue of the Lysippean Eros - was stolen. It was taken from the grounds of Aske Hall in the 1970s and has never been recovered.

The sculpture was offered for auction by the will trust of the 3rd Marquess of Zetland, Lawrence Dundas, who was chairman of Catterick and Redcar racecourses and died in 1989.

Grand: Aske Hall is owned by the Marquess Of Zetland, who only found out that the sculpture dated back to the 2nd Century after an antiquities expert made a routine visit to the estate
