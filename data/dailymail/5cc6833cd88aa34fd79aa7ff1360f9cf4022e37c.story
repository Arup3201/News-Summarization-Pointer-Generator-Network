The man suspected of killing the two-year-old biological son of NFL star Adrian Peterson has been arrested for kidnapping and assaulting the child's mother.

Joseph Robert Patterson, released last year on bail and the condition he remain away from Ann 'Ashley' Doohen,'.is now in custody for kidnapping and assaulting her, sources told TMZ.

Patterson, 27, was the live-in boyfriend Doohen prior to Tyrese Ruffin's death, he is due in court Wednesday afternoon on two charges of aggravated assault, a single charge of kidnapping and of burglary, the site reported.

Back in custody:  Joseph Robert Patterson, charged last year in connection with the death of Adrian Peterson's son and this year for the kidnapping and assault of he boy's mother, is back in custody and due in court Wednesday (pictured during a court appearance last year)

Patterson was the only one at her apartment with Tyrese the day he was brutally beaten, and he was later charged with aggravated assault and aggravated battery.

Those charges were increased to include second-degree murder and manslaughter following Tyrese's death at a hospital two days later.

Patterson's attorney confirmed that he has been released- in spite of his prior domestic violence convictions- and said that there are no conditions or restrictions attached to his bail bond.

Tim Rensch, the attorney, said that his client will remain in the area in order to defend himself against the charges.

Patterson's father has spoken out about his son's well being and his condition when he was in jail, saying that he was growing frustrated with the accusations against him.

'He’s moving into a pissed-off stage now. He’s getting bitter,' Grant Patterson told The New York Daily News.

'There’s a double tragedy in this case. My son’s heart bleeds for the child. I pray there is no rush to judgment.

'There are death threats against my son.'

His son was living with the boy's mother, Ann 'Ashley' Doohen, and he had a history of violence.

Patterson, 27, had a restraining order filed against him over his high school girlfriend in 2004.

Noell Uhlir filed a petition in order to get protection for her daughter Carlie Rae who was dating Joey at the time.

'I believe that Joey is mentally unstable, and it is only a matter of time before he harms himself, my daughter or anyone that may step in,' she wrote.

'Joey needs professional help.'

The second legal incident came in June 2012 when he was indicted for multiple counts of simple assault.

Strong-willed: The young boy initially survived the beating but succumbed to the injuries at a hospital only days later

The victim in that situation was his then-girlfriend who has not been named and the 3-year-old son that the couple had together.

The girlfriend said that Patterson slapped their son on his bare butt causing him to need ice to calm the welts, and later Patterson attempted to strangle her and threatened her life.

Following incident, he violated the no-contact order that came in that case, and was due to spend a year in jail over the charges but that was ruled out by his agreement to attend domestic violence conseling.

The death of Tyrese last week was brought into the national spotlight as it was revealed that Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson was actually the boy's biological father.

Peterson said he didn't know the child was his until about two months ago and had been working with the boy's mother to support the family financially.

Such a tragedy: Tyrese was only two-years-old when he was callously beaten to death

'It was a difficult day, just taking in the circumstance and the whole situation,' Peterson said of Wednesday's funeral in Sioux Falls. 'A child was buried. That's difficult for anyone.

'I was planning on seeing him and I had talked with his mom and had gotten some things together as far as financially helping her. Unfortunately, this situation took place and it's devastating.

'A lot of people won't ever understand the situation that I'm in and see it the way I'm seeing the situation,' he said.

'It's tough, but I'm able to deal with that. I got a good supporting cast around me. I'm standing strong, I am.'
