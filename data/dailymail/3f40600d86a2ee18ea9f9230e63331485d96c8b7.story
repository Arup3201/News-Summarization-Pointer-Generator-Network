Weapons that dominated Europe for more than 3,000 years were introduced by the ancient Minoan civilisation, according to a new study.

Swords, metal battle axes, long bladed spears, shields and possibly even armour were brought to Europe by the Minoans who ruled Crete.

The finding overturns the popular perception originally put forward by archaeologists that Ancient Crete was one of the most peaceful civilisations in history.

The palace of Knossos reveals an advanced and organised society.

Since towns and palaces in Crete, the home of the mythical Minotaur, were first dug up and studied a century ago the Minoans have been widely regarded by archaeologists as an essentially peaceful people.

The reputation was built up because of what was perceived as a lack of images of war preserved in jewellery, frescoes and other artifacts at the Palace of Knossos and other key sites.

But a reassessment of the role of warriors and weapons in Ancient Crete, which was at its peak from 1900BC to 1300BC, now concludes that the Minoans were a violent and warlike people.

Dr Barry Molloy, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield, carried out the study and concluded that there was ‘a staggering amount of violence’ in Minoan society.

‘Their world was uncovered just over a century ago, and was deemed to be a largely peaceful society,’ he said.

‘In time, many took this to be a paradigm of a society that was devoid of war, where warriors and violence were shunned and played no significant role.

Bull-leaping shown in a Minoan fresco was a skill that would have been prized by a military elite, Dr Molloy says.

‘That utopian view has not survived into modern scholarship, but it remains in the background unchallenged and still crops up in modern texts and popular culture with surprising frequency.

"In fact it is to Crete we must look for the origin of those weapons that were to dominate Europe until the Middle Ages, namely swords, metal battle-axes, shields, spears and probably armour also.’

The double-headed battle-axes would have made a lethal close-quarters weapon that could hook over and drag down an opponent's shield, while a spear-head that was designed to punch through armour.

He said most of the weapons started appearing in Crete in about 1800BC and continued until the introduction of gunpowder in about 1500AD.

Such military hardware, he said, was honed by the Cretans before being taken up by other European civilisations, including the Ancient Greeks.

He started looking at just how peaceful or warlike Ancient Crete was and soon realised there was not just a wealth of evidence of violence but that warfare was ‘a defining characteristic of the Minoan society’.

Images of bull-leaping, boxing, wrestling and hunting were accompanied by symbols of a warrior elite, he said, and that it was an expression of male identity.

‘ Ideologies of war are shown to have permeated religion, art, industry, politics and trade, and the social practices surrounding martial traditions were demonstrably a structural part of how this society evolved and how they saw themselves,’ he said.

‘There were few spheres of interaction in Crete that did not have a martial component, right down to the symbols used in their written scripts.’

In a paper - Martial Minoans? War as social process, practice and event in Bronze Age Crete - published in the Annual of the British School at Athens, he said Cretan weapons illustrated the transition from ‘the use of the tools of hunting’ to ‘purpose-designed weapons of war’.

He added: ‘The introduction of the sword represented a quantum leap in combat practice.’
