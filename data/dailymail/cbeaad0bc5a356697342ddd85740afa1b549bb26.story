The use of CCTV spy cars that issue parking fines will be severely restricted to stop their widespread abuse, the road safety minister has promised.

Robert Goodwill said profits from parking penalties had more than doubled from £223million to £512million between 1998 and 2011 – and are expected to rise to £635million in 2014.

During that time many councils have started using mobile CCTV spy cars in addition to traditional parking wardens.

Money spinners: Road safety minister Robert Goodwill said a recent Transport Select Committee revealed some councils have been using CCTV cars for parking enforcement as 'a matter of routine'

There was now a ‘deeply rooted public perception’ that local authorities view parking enforcement as a cash cow to boost their coffers Mr Goodwill warned.

CCTV would in future be limited to areas around schools, in bus lanes, at bus stops and on red ‘no stop’ routes, he said.

Speaking at the annual Parkex exhibition in London, Mr Goodwill said a recent Transport Select Committee revealed some councils have been using CCTV for parking enforcement as ‘a matter of routine’.

He said: ‘That is not acceptable. The surveillance camera code of practice has long been clear that CCTV should be used sparingly and only where other means of enforcement are unpractical.

‘What is essential is that the public have confidence that where CCTV is being used it is to promote safety and to tackle congestion. Nothing else.’

Mr Goodwill said his aim was to put an end to practices that ‘offend a sense of natural justice’.

Above all there must be fair enforcement, he said: ‘The use of CCTV, in particular, causes public concern. But so does the perception that enforcement officers are waiting to pounce the moment the meter runs out.

‘Motorists should not be fearful about returning to their vehicles a few minutes late. Indeed, in most cases, drivers return with unexpired time left and the council can then re-sell the space and, in effect, be paid double.’

Mr Goodwill noted how the Transport Select committee had concluded  that the current appeals system disadvantaged people who had ‘inadvertently make a mistake.’

He added: ‘Their sense was that the current system discourages people from appealing their tickets.

‘People who have a legitimate reason not to pay are simply giving up and paying the fine. That offends a sense of natural justice.’

Mr Goodwill said he wanted to give parking bosses ‘a flavour of our thinking’ ahead of announcing new rules soon in a new shake-up.

But the AA yesterday warned the abuse of CCTV could continue if it was only curtailed rather than banned.

AA President Edmund King said : ‘Motorists will still have concerns about CCTV cars, even if their use is curtailed.

‘But we welcome a decent grace period to protect drivers who otherwise get unfairly fined if their watch is two minutes out of synch with the town hall clock.’
