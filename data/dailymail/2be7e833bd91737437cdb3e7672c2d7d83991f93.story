Hopes of a Jurassic Park style resurrection of dinosaurs may have to stay in the ‘realms of fiction’, according to a study.

The chance of bringing to life a T-Rex or a Diploids by extracting DNA from insects in amber, as depicted in the 1993 film, have been described as ‘highly unlikely’, according a study published in PLOS ONE.

In the Spielberg movie, scientists extract dino DNA from ancient mosquitos trapped in 130-million year old amber.

The year before the film was released, scientists in California claimed to have extracted fragments of DNA from an extinct species of bee.

But a study by the the Natural History Museum, London, found it was impossible to replicate.

Using highly-sensitive ‘next generation’ sequencing DNA techniques on insects in copal, the sub-fossilised resin precursor of amber, researchers found the 1990’s studies provided ‘false positives’ mistaken for genuine ancient DNA.

In fact they could find not detect ancient DNA in relatively young- 60 years to 10,600 years old- sub-fossilised insects and said the earlier results are thought to come from cross contamination between modern and ancient DNA.

Researchers said the results raise significant doubts about claims of DNA extraction from fossil insects in amber

Study co author Professor Terry Brown, who carried out the study in full forensic suits in the ancient DNA lab at the University of Manchester, said: 'In the original 1990s studies DNA amplification was achieved by a process called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which will preferentially amplify any modern, undamaged DNA molecules that contaminate an extract of partially degraded ancient ones to give false positive results that might be mistaken for genuine ancient DNA.

'Our approach, using "next generation" sequencing methods is ideal for ancient DNA because it provides sequences for all the DNA molecules in an extract, regardless of their length, and is less likely to give preference to contaminating modern molecules.'

Researchers said the results raise significant doubts about claims of DNA extraction from fossil insects in amber.

Co author Dr David Penney, also from Manchester University, said: 'Intuitively, one might imagine that the complete and rapid engulfment in resin, resulting in almost instantaneous demise, might promote the preservation of DNA in a resin entombed insect, but this appears not to be the case.

'So, unfortunately, the Jurassic Park scenario must remain in the realms of fiction.'
