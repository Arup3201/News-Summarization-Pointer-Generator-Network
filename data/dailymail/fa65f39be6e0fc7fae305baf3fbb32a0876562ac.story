Eighties pop star Richard Marx has likened Dr Drew to notorious Jack 'Doctor Death' Kevorkian after news of country singer Mindy McCready's apparent suicide.

'I think ‘Dr’ Drew Pinsky should change his name to Kevorkian. Same results,' he wrote on Twitter Monday night before deleting it several hours later.

He later backtracked but but then many began criticizing the doctor's work on Celebrity Rehab, the reality television show that McCready starred in seasons ago.

'I went too far with the Kevorkian crack. It is, however, my opinion that what Dr. D does is exploitation and his TV track record is not good,' Marx said, referring to the four other show contestants who have died as a result of their drug and addiction battles.

VH1's Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew is not currently on the air. Pinsky switched his focus to non-celebrities in Season 6 last fall and changed the title to 'Rehab.' The show spawned two spinoffs, 'Sober House' and 'Sex Rehab.'

McCready was a sympathetic character on the show and appeared to be far less damaged than her fellow cast members, some of whom experienced fairly graphic symptoms of opiate withdrawal in front of the cameras.

McCready suffered a seizure while on the show, further endearing her to Pinsky and the others.

She said in a 2010 interview with The Associated Press that she initially turned Pinsky down.

'But Dr. Drew said something to me that just mowed me over literally, just floored me,' she said. 'He said, `You've been being treated for the symptoms of what's wrong with you, not the problem. And you're going to have to put your family aside for a moment, put their feelings aside for a moment and worry about you because if you don't get better, it doesn't matter what your family thinks. You're not going to be there anymore.''

Pinsky diagnosed her with 'love addiction' during the series' run and called her an 'angel' in the finale.

In
an interview with The Associated Press several months later, he said 
McCready had a good shot at recovery if she remained in treatment.

'Like with anybody I treat, it's really up to them,' Pinsky said.

'I
never know. If they do the work they're supposed to do, yes (there can 
be success). If she does the work it will be great. It's up to her how 
much of that she does, how much she feels she needs to do. It seems like
she's doing rather well right now so I hope she continues to do so.'

Three
years later, she's dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot to the 
head, adding her name to a growing list of Celebrity Rehab cast members 
who died as a result of their issues.

Former Real World contestant Joey 
Kovar died in August of last year, just three years after the third 
season of Celebrity Rehab aired. Though his family said that he had 
maintained his sobriety following the show, an autopsy revealed that his
cause of death was opiate intoxication.  That is believed to be a result of the 
painkiller that he was taking at the time, which was called Norco and 
classified as an opiate though it was never confirmed that the drug 
caused his death.

Their fellow cast mate Mike Starr, a 
bass player from the grunge rock band Alice in Chains, was arrested in 
February 2011 for possessing two different types of prescription 
medication that were deemed controlled substances. He was found dead 
less than a month later as a result of what Dr Drew deemed a 
prescription drug overdose.

The
two other stars who died after their series aired were actor Jeff 
Conaway of Grease fame and Rodney King, the man whose beating sparked 
the Los Angeles police brutality riots.

Conaway,
who made a name for himself as Kenickie in the musical film, was 
featured on both the show's first and second seasons because his 
addiction to prescription medication returned following back surgeries. At first it was thought that he died in 
May 2011 due to a drug overdose, but Dr Drew later made a public 
statement saying that he was placed in a medically induced coma 
following a combination of pneumonia and sepsis caused by years of drug 
abuse.

King, who shot to fame after he was 
seen being beaten by police in Los Angeles which went on to prompt the 
infamous riots of the early 1990s, was found dead after having drowned 
in his swimming pool. The 
drowning was ruled an accident but an autopsy proved that he had a mix 
of cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol in his system at the time of his 
death in June of last year.

Mike Starr, a former bassist for the 
grunge rock band Alice in Chains, was the first 'Celebrity Rehab' star 
to die after his appearance on the show.

Starr appeared on the show in 2009 in its third season.

He admitted to being addicted to heroin, methadone, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana.

In February 2011, Starr was arrested for possessing two kinds of painkillers without a prescription.

One
month later, on March 8, 2011, he was found dead at his Salt Lake City,
Utah, home. Dr Drew Pinsky described his death as a 'prescription drug 
overdose.'

He was 44.

Jeff Conaway made a name for himself in 'Grease,' where he played Kenickie.

He
appeared on season one of 'Celebrity Rehab' in 2008 in an attempt to 
overcome his addiction to alcohol, cocaine and prescription drugs.

He also appeared in the second season of the show, after he relapsed following back surgery.

On
May 11, 2011, Conaway was found unconscious at his home in Encino, 
California. Doctors said he was in coma after suffering from pneumonia 
with sepsis, which was made worse by his years of drug abuse.

Two weeks later, his family took him off life support.

He died at age 60.

 

Rodney King became a celebrity after 
he his brutal beating by LAPD cops was caught on tape. Their acquittal 
resulted in the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

King appeared on 'Celebrity Rehab' in 2008 to cope with long-term alcoholism.

He also had a history of drug abuse.

He
also appeared on 'Sober House' and continued to appear on Dr Drew's 
programs as he worked through his substance addictions and trauma from 
being battered by police.

On June 17, 2012, he was found lying at the bottom of his swimming pool in Rialto, California.

An autopsy found alcohol, marijuana and cocaine in his system.

He was 47.

Joy Kovar's drug an alcohol addiction 
became so pronounced during his run on MTV's 'Real World' that he was 
kicked off the show in 2008.

He joined season three of 'Celebrity Rehab,' which aired in 2010. 

On the show, he admitted to abusing alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine and steroids.

His family said he remained clean for six months while he pursued an acting career.

On August 17, 2012, he was found dead in an apartment in Chicago.

Reports
from the time say he died of a suspected drug overdose after drinking 
heavily and taking cocaine and Viagra the night before.

 

McCready walked away from treatment 
several days ago after her father asked a judge to intervene. Her body 
was found on the front porch of a home she shared with David Wilson, the
longtime boyfriend and father of her youngest son who appears to have 
killed himself in the same spot last month.

Bob Forrest, a chemical dependency 
counselor who appeared on Season 3 of 'Celebrity Rehab' and continues to
work with Pinsky, said a discussion about mental health and substance 
abuse issues is important.

But attacking Pinsky has only distracted from the real issues.

'Regardless of your feelings about 
how we do it with the TV show, calling Dr. Drew `Dr. Kevorkian,' what 
kind of dialogue is that?' he said.

'It's a good headline. We're going 
through a growth spurt in regards to who we are as a country. I really 
feel there's something going on in America beyond Mindy McCready's 
death.'
