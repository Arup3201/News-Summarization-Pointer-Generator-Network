When it comes to the art of creating collages, the work of this artist is first class.

In fact, John Bottomley has got the world’s 
most iconic celebrities licked after he created portraits of them - using only postage stamps.

The
64-year old former butler has produced pictures of Michael Jackson, 
Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and Liza Minnelli by sticking used first 
and second class stamps onto a canvas.

The
avid stamp collector has also made up a special 2012 Olympic tribute to
a local sports club also made entirely out of stamps. Each picture 
takes John around 30 hours to complete and needs about 1,500 stamps - 
around £700 worth if bought new.

First-class: Jack Bottomley works on his Marilyn Monroe portrait. Some of his works can take more than 30 hours to make

Father-of-one John, from Clayton, 
Manchester, who cares full time for his wife said: 'I must have a million
stamps, I’ve got albums full and as I love artwork it just seemed to 
make sense to use old stamps to create pictures.

'But
when I get orders for my work I do wonder whether I should cheekily ask
the Royal Mail for free postage - because of all the stamps I use.

'I’ve not made any money from it, it’s just cost me a lot of time and my own money, but it is a love.

'I
was collecting stamps back with my brother back in the 60s; the first 
was probably just a normal postage stamp, I would have cut it off and 
started to collect them.

'The first one I did was Elvis, it was a challenge straight through, I think it took me about thirty hours.

'So
far I’ve done Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson and I’ve just started 
Liza Minnelli and whatever else comes along. I’ve got an order from a 
friend for an Elvis one.

Return to sender: John has also made a portrait of Elvis Presley. Sometimes John uses as many as 1,500 stamps in each piece

'I’ve
done one for the 2012 Olympics, I’ve not seen anything in stamps about 
like that before, and it’s quite unusual. It’s not easy because it can 
take so long and I hate wasting stamps. You do also end up with lots of 
glue on your hands.'

John says he was first inspired to 
collect when he saw a little dish his uncle made completely out of 
stamps and couldn’t get over how unusual it was.

And from there his collection grew and grew with him even purchasing three bin liners full of postage stamps for £300.

But after years of making plates, cards and gifts for friends and family he decided to branch out to re-creating images.

He
added: 'I’ve collected stamps on and off over many years. I first got 
the idea in my aunt’s house when I saw a plate on her wall, made by my 
now late uncle and he’d done it out of stamps.

What a dish: John with one of the plate collages he has created, commemorating the London 2012 Olympics

'It
was four or five different colours and I’d never seen anything like it 
before. I used to do plates and then I thought there must be a way of 
using the stamps in pictures.

'But when you pixilate an image the pixels are square and stamps are oblong, so it’s not easy and then you have all the colours and shading as well.

'The Elvis one must have taken me over thirty hours alone. I’ve got to get my stamps first of all cutting them off or steaming them off and drying them and then sorting them into colours and getting them ready to start.

'The problem is its very hard to get someone to be able to pixilate a picture, there’s only one person I’ve found who can do it properly.

'But I’ve also done birthday cards, Christmas cards all made out of postage stamps they’re much better than the ones you can buy over the internet.

'They’re completely unique and people are just over the moon when they see them, no one else is going to have one like it.'
