The men known as the Central Park Five - who were wrongly convicted of the vicious rape of a jogger in 1989 - have agreed on a $40 million settlement with the city of New York.

The resolution will mark the end of a 12-year legal battle the five men have fought after they spent years in prison as a result of the attack which shocked the nation and led in part to the implementation of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's clean up of New York City.

The men initially filed a $250 million civil-rights lawsuit after the overturn of their false convictions in 2002 for acting as a 'wolf pack' of 'wilding' youths who attacked 28-year-old jogger Trisha Meili in 1989.

The five men - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Kharey Wise - were tried and found guilty of the rape of the investment banker and all served prison time.

She was in a coma for 12 days and was left with permanent damage and no memory of the attack.

All the men were aged 14-16 at the time of their arrest and alleged police brutality forced confessions from them.

They also argued at the time that key DNA evidence was ignored during their trial which would have triggered a not guilty verdict.

The five black and Hispanic men had their convictions overturned in December 2002, when an investigation discovered DNA proof they had not raped her, but that she was attacked by one lone man.

This man, Matias Reyes, a convicted rapist already in prison, confessed to acting alone in the assault and the men were freed.

The agreed deal, which must be approved by the city comptroller, averages out at roughly $1 million for each year of imprisonment for the five men.

That means that Kharey Wise, who spent 13-years in prison, will be the largest single payout New York City has made in a wrongful conviction case.

The other four men all served around seven years in prison.

The men are all in their late 30s or early 40s now and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was said to be keen to have the case settled.

This was in direct contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who argued the original $250 million suit was too high because authorities acted in good faith.

Indeed, according to the New York Times, the city's Law Department backed this opinion at the time.

'The case is not about whether the teens were wrongly convicted,' a department spokeswoman said.

'It’s about whether prosecutors and police deliberately engaged in misconduct.'

The attack on 28-year-old investment banker Trisha Meili occurred on April 19, 1989. It was one of the most notorious crimes in New York City history and it mesmerized the nation, serving as a lurid symbol of the city's racial and class divide and its rampant crime.

It gave rise to the term 'wilding' for urban mayhem by teenagers.

'Drugs. Guns. Gangs. New York City was just crime central at that time,' said former New York Detective Kirk Burkhalter, recalling an era so blood-soaked that the city had a record 2,245 homicides in 1990, compared with 414 in 2012.

'You were scared to ride the trains after dark. It was such a different place.'

Trisha Meili was out jogging in Central Park on April 19, 1989, when she was bound, gagged, raped and beaten nearly to death, a chilling crime to which five teenage boys confessed after hours of interrogation by New York City police.

From the start, the rape of a 28-year-old white woman in the park drew intense media coverage and led to the term 'wilding' to describe gangs of youths terrorizing random passersby.

The five were convicted in 1990 based on the confessions, delivered after interrogations that in some cases lasted overnight.

Twelve years later, Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist who had attacked a woman in the park two days before Meili's assault, confessed to the crime, and DNA testing tied him to the rape.

In a 2002 report recommending the convictions be vacated, prosecutor Nancy Ryan concluded that the boys' confessions contained 'troubling discrepancies' and that Reyes' description of the attack matched the crime scene.

A judge vacated the convictions. By then, however, the boys had already been released after serving sentences ranging from five years to 13 years.

In 2002, NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly appointed a panel to produce its own report, which concluded that the boys likely attacked Meili before Reyes did.

Former prosecutor Michael Armstrong, who co-authored the report, said Ryan erred in dismissing the boys' confessions entirely.

'It seems impossible to say that they weren't there at all, because they knew too much,' he said in an interview.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the belief that the boys are guilty is pervasive among the dozens of police officers who have been deposed.

'They protect each other,' said Jane Fisher-Byrialsen, a lawyer for the five. 'It's always like this.'

However, in prison, three of the men, Richardson, Salaam and Santan said they were innocent but acknowledged they were in the park committing assualts - but not rape.

Mr. Santana indicated in his hearing that the larger group was out to rob people. 'I took part in with the beatings of that man,' he said.

'If I could go back in time and not do it again, you know, it would have been a whole different story.'

The men’s lawyers have long said that their clients committed no crimes in the park that night.

When Meili was found in the brush, more than 75 percent of her blood had drained from her body and her skull was smashed.

She was in a coma for 12 days, left with permanent damage, and remembers nothing about the attack.

Meili later went public as a motivational speaker and wrote a book.

Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson, both 14 at the time, Antron McCray and Salaam, 15, and Korey Wise, 16, were rounded up and arrested.

After hours of interrogation, four of them recorded confessions on video, in some cases with the boys' parents in the room.

At the trials, their lawyers argued the confessions were coerced. At the time, DNA testing was not sophisticated enough to make or break the case.

In 2002, a re-examination of the case found that DNA on the victim's sock pointed to Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist who confessed that he alone attacked the jogger.

Then-District Attorney Robert Morgenthau stopped short of declaring the Central Park Five innocent but withdrew all charges and did not seek a retrial. (The statute of limitations for charging Reyes had run out; he is serving a life sentence for other crimes.)

Roger Wareham, one of the lawyers for the five, said the DNA was the key.

'There was never any forensic evidence that tied them to this case,' he said. 'In 1989, everybody might not have been forensic savvy, but now, after 'Law and Order,' everybody knows if there's no DNA, they didn't do it.'

But an overturned conviction does not automatically mean there was any wrongdoing by prosecutors or police.

Legal experts said the case took a long time in part because of the money and reputations at stake.

The two-hour documentary, 'The Central Park Five,' made the case that the men were wrongly convicted.

The film uses extensive interviews with the men and their families, and lawyers for the city went to court to demand outtakes for use in the civil case.

The defendants' lives since they got out of prison have not been easy. Wise was recently re-arrested. McCray moved away.

Santana sold drugs and was sent back to prison, but now, along with Richardson and Salaam, has become the public face of the case, speaking out against wrongful convictions and racial profiling.

'We are over being angry. Now it's about helping others, raising our own families right,' said Santana, now 39 last year.
