Wayne Rooney has targeted Peter Shilton’s record of 125 England caps as he closes in on a raft of historic landmarks in English football.

The England captain, who is 29 later this month, will become the youngest player to reach 100 England caps when England play Slovenia on November 15 and will then be targeting David Beckham’s record for an outfield player of 115 caps, as well as Shilton’s all-time record of 125.

Rooney will break Bobby Moore’s record as the youngest player to reach a century of caps — Moore was 32 when he achieved the feat — and is closing in on Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring records for England and Manchester United, so the next two years are likely to see him take his place among the English game’s greatest players.

Rooney, who will receive his 99th cap when he captains the team against Estonia on Sunday, said: ‘I couldn’t even imagine getting 100 caps when I made my first appearance for England. At that age you don’t look beyond the next game. It is a privilege to play for England in the games that I’ve clocked up.

‘It’s there now, two more games. I’ve always said that I don’t want to stop after I get 100, I want to get many more and try to do my best for the team.’

Asked whether he could overhaul Shilton’s 125 caps, Rooney said: ‘I believe so. I think it’s 16 or 17 games before Euro 2016 starts so I won’t be too far away then and then I have at least another two years after that.

‘There is no reason to think about stopping. That time will come later in my career but at the moment it is not even close to entering my mind. I love playing for England and I feel I have many more years. Unless told otherwise by the coaches I will always be available for selection.’

Rooney is on 42 international goals, seven away from Charlton’s record of 49 in 106 appearances and closing in on Jimmy Greaves (44) and Gary Lineker (48) on the all-time list.

He has scored 219 goals for United and is close to overhauling Denis Law on 237 goals and Charlton, the all-time United record goalscorer, on 249.
