CoverGirl has come out against domestic violence, but continued to show support for the NFL, in a statement released late last night.

After saying they are a brand that has long 'supported women and stood for female empowerment,' they called on the NFL 'to take swift action on their path forward to address the issue of domestic violence.'

The brand, which bills itself as the 'official beauty sponsor of the NFL,' became a part of the discussion regarding the league's handling of domestic abuse offenses over the weekend when photoshopped versions of their NFL ads depicting battered women went viral.

Statement; CoverGirl says they are urging the NFL to take 'swift action' in solving its domestic violence problem, as these photoshopped ads (above) continue to go viral

They also stated their belief that 'domestic violence is completely unacceptable.' 

The full statement reads, 'As a brand that has always supported women and stood for female empowerment, CoverGirl believes domestic violence is completely unacceptable. 

We developed our NFL program to celebrate the more than 80 million female football fans. 

In light of recent events, we have encouraged the NFL to take swift action on their path forward to address the issue of domestic violence.' 

Unfortunately, this was not enough for some of those 80 million female football fans the cosmetic giant claims to be reaching with their NFL partnership, who called on parent company Procter & Gamble to do more in the wake of the two recent high profile domestic abuse incidents involving star players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson.

Some are even urging a boycott of CoverGirl on Twitter until they take stronger action or withdraw their sponsorship entirely.

Problem players: Adrian Peterson (left, with son Adrian Peterson Jr.) has been indicted on charges of negligent injury for hitting one of his children with a switch, while Ray Rice (right, with wife Janay and Daughter Rayven) has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL after video of him punching his now-wife went public

The photshopped ads were not even originally meant as an attack on CoverGirl, but rather an attempt to shame NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, using the hashtag #GoodellMustGo. 

This comes after video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. 

Rice has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, will return to team play this weekend.
