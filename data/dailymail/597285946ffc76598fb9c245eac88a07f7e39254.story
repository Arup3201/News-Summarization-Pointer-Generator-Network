Jamie Vardy has scored against a United from Manchester before. Not the club boasting a single player worth almost £60million, however, but the one formed in 2005 by fans unhappy about the Glazer family takeover.

‘A tap-in in front of 4,000 fans,’ recalled 27-year-old Vardy on Sunday night, fresh from vanquishing far greater adversaries with his searing pace and aggression.

That 4-1 victory for Halifax Town in the Northern Premier League Premier Division came on New Year’s Day 2011, and the crowd (4,023 to be exact) was the largest in the division’s history — swollen because of the relative size of each club.

Halifax finished as champions that season, but Vardy, then 24, was out-scored in the strikers’ chart by Ross Hannah of Matlock Town (35 goals to 24). Hannah is now at Grimsby Town, no small climb itself, but Vardy’s trajectory is on another gradient altogether.

He was at Halifax for only a year. Before that, between 2003 and 2010, he played for Stocksbridge Park Steels on the eighth rung of the football ladder, having been released by Sheffield Wednesday for being too small.

‘When I signed for Stocksbridge I was only 17, getting kicked left, right, and centre by fully-grown blokes,’ Vardy remembered while clutching his man-of-the-match award.

‘That toughens you up. When it comes to games like this, they are always going to try get in your face — it doesn’t faze me one bit.’

Vardy was scoring in non-League football as recently as 2012 but has made incredible progress at Leicester

In his early years at Stocksbridge, a town of 17,000 people in north Sheffield, Vardy was under curfew and obliged to wear an electronic tag on his ankle after being charged with assault. He was struggling to cope with the anguish at seeing his golden opportunity in the game seemingly disappear.

‘When I was released by Wednesday I thought that was it,’ said Vardy in an interview last year. 

‘There were some hard times. It wasn’t nice wearing the tag and it’s not good having to be in your house at 6pm every night.

‘I was sticking up for a mate who was deaf and somebody was taking the p*** out of him for wearing a hearing aid. They got thrown out of the pub but they were waiting for us an hour and half later.

‘They started attacking him and I wasn’t going to stand there and let him take a beating. I learned from that and from that stage things started looking up.’

During his time at Stocksbridge, where the ground holds 3,500 people, Leicester manager Nigel Pearson, who lives in the Sheffield area, would watch him play as he plundered 66 goals in 107 league games.

Vardy is extremely popular with both his teammates and the Leicester fans and is rewarding their faith

‘We’ve known about him since then,’ said Pearson in March. ‘A long, long time.’ Vardy went from Halifax to Conference National side Fleetwood Town in 2011 and 31 goals in 36 league games later, Pearson finally made his move.

Leicester paid £1m for his signature, a record for a non-League player, in May 2012.

‘It was probably more than we’d have liked to have paid,’ admitted Pearson, ‘but it was needed when there were four or five other Championship sides who wanted to sign him all of a sudden.’

Another signpost in Vardy’s remarkable story is that he scored twice in the Blue Square Premier against Lincoln as recently as April 2012.

In his first season at Leicester Vardy struggled severely to adjust and has said he almost quit as a result of heavy criticism. But last season he came back fitter and was a major reason behind the Foxes’ march to the Championship title, scoring 16 goals.

He is an immensely popular member of the dressing room, earning the nickname Cannon more for his explosive sense of humour than powerful shooting, it appears.

‘I’m a bit of a nut-job in the changing room,’ laughed Vardy last night having out-performed Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. 

‘We’ve all had different routes. Mine was a bit worse but I’ve managed to make my way up that pyramid. I couldn’t tell you what league I started at.’

Vardy paid tribute to his manager for having faith. ‘It was a massive gamble but hopefully now I’m repaying him.’
