Johan Cruyff has given a damming verdict of the Ballon d'Or and described Cristiano Ronaldo's last two titles as 'absurd'.

But the Barcelona icon is not dismayed at the Portuguese attacker's victories because of his affiliation with Real Madrid, as Cruyff is adamant Ronaldo's club team-mate Toni Kroos should have taken the award.

The 67-year-old hailed Kroos' achievements with Bayern Munich in 2013, where  Pep Guardiola's side cruised to league victory by 25 points, before lauding him for his attacking displays at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a tournament he said Ronaldo was 'invisible' in.

'At the highest level, it's a combination of individual talent and titles,' Cruyff told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. 'From this point of view, it is absurd that, for the second consecutive year, the prize has been given to a player who has not played excellently [at a major tournament] or won the most titles.

'In 2013, Bayern Munich won everything there was to win, and yet Cristiano Ronaldo won the award instead of Toni Kroos or any other Bayern player.

'In 2014, Kroos was again decisive in the team that won the World Cup, and yet he was not in the three finalists. Ronaldo was invisible in the World Cup.

'I just cannot take this FIFA award seriously.'

Kroos, who moved to Madrid after his World Cup triumph, was named in the FIFA World XI alongside Madrid team-mates Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos.

Cruyff won the Ballon d'Or three times himself in 1971, 73 and 74.

Despite Ronaldo continuing his relentless scoring record and won the Champions League, the Dutchman believes these feats are not as significant as Kroos' impact at the World Cup.

Kroos shone in all seven appearances in the tournament for Germany and scored twice in the 7-1 semi-final victory over hosts Brazil.
