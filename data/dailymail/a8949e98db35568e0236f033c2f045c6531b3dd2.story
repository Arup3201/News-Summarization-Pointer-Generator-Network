America has long been branded a nation that isn't interested in Soccer.

However, the Brazil world cup could change all that - at least if the reaction to America's goal against Ghana is anything to go by.

Twitter revealed that over 174,00 tweets per minute were sent when Clint Dempsey scored in the first minute.

Just after Clint Dempsey set a national record by scoring after just 32 seconds, Twitter exploded into life with 174,00 tweets per minute being sent.

  more than 4.9 million tweets were sent during the game

Twitter also revealed that more than 4.9 million tweets were sent during the game, which was the highest ever rater World Cup game on ESPN.

Demspey also saw a massive increase in followers on Twitter - 27 times his usual rate.

However, the match failed to generate more tweets than the opener, where the hosts played Croatia in the opening match of the tournament.

After falling a goal behind early in the game, Brazil rallied to win 3-1, maintaining their status as favourites for the event.

Twitter dominated conversation around the match, with some 12.2 million tweets sent during the game.

More than 150 countries joined in the discussion, and Brazil’s Neymar – who picked up 165,000 new followers over the 90 minutes – was the most talked-about player.

Last night's match means the U.S. and Germany are now level-pegging at the top of Group G with one win each, while Ghana and Portugal are at the bottom.

Ghana dominated much the rest of the game, making a total of 21 shots, but only scored one goal when Andre Ayew leveled in the 82nd minute.

That was quick: Clint Dempsey scored 32 seconds into the U.S. World Cup team's game against Ghana on Monday

Just four minutes later, Brooks - a 21-year-old who came on at halftime because Matt Besler was injured — scored off a corner from Graham Zusi.

It was the first time an American sub had ever scored in the World Cup.

Dempsey's goal made him the first U.S. player to score in three different World Cups and was the fastest ever scored by an American in the tournament.

Dempsey's goal showed the kind of technical flair seldom seen from a squad that typically scores through set pieces.

Brooks' game winner came in the waning minutes as the Americans were desperately trying to survive waves of attacks from Ghana.

DaMarcus Beasley, who became the first American to play in four World Cups, started the buildup to Dempsey's goal with a pass to Jermaine Jones, who fed it to Dempsey inside the penalty area.

With a nifty move to split defenders John Boye and Sulley Muntari, Dempsey sent the left-footed shot past goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey, where the ball bounced off the post and in.

Ghana applied relentless pressure on U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard and finally drew even when captain Asamoah Gyan flicked a backheel pass to Ayew, who used the outside of his left foot for a powerful shot.

Ghana was still pressing for a winner when Brooks delivered the header.

He appeared shocked to have scored, raising his hands to his head before falling to the ground to be mobbed by his teammates.

Meanwhile, fans across the U.S. - and across the globe - are celebrating the win over the team that dashed their World Cup hopes in the previous two tournaments.
