A group of young German inventors are poised to carry flight tests of the world's first winged jetpack that can take off from the ground.

Fritz Unger and his friends from Hanover have spent more than five years so far developing their one-man, jet-propelled wing.

Once completed, the backpack-mounted aircraft, dubbed Skyflash, will be the smallest twin-engined aeroplane ever built and could herald a new era of personal air travel.

The team behind it say that it should be able to hit top speeds of more than 200mph, with a flight ceiling of 26,000ft, easily steered by the movement of the pilot's body.

And unlike the jet packs made famous by Jetman Yves Rossy, the Skyflash will be able to take off from the ground instead of being dropped from an aircraft.

Although Mr Unger has been a pilot since the age of 14, he has always dreamed of flying without the encumbrance of a plane or glider, Gizmag reports.

The Skyflash's design is said to be based on the wings of the condor, large broad-winged soaring birds which are able to alter their wing structure to exploit variable wind conditions in their mountainous habitat.

Accordingly, the wings on the Skyflash are composed of three units that separate for more surface area to provide lift on take off then contract in flight for greater speed and stability.

Similar technology is already used on a much larger scale in modern jet airliners.

Skyflash is powered by dual microturbine diesel jet engines built into the so-called 'WingBody' backpack section, which also holds the flight computer and control electronics.

Before take-off the pilot puts on the WingBody like a backpack and fastens it to himself, before presumably enlisting a helper to attach the wings, which also contain the fuel tanks, using a quick release system.

Across his front sits the landing gear, which has four 10in off-road tires the Skyflash team claim is 'able to cope with potholed grass runways'.

With one eye on the cost, the Skyflash team have built their revolutionary aircraft from aviation plywood, which has also enabled them to keep its empty weight down to 55lbs.

Controlling the Skyflash is achieved via an 8in graphical user interface attached to the flight computer and a throttle in the pilot's right hand that looks like those which come with cheap remote control cars.

Once in the air, the pilot steers the Skyflash by shifting his body weight. The angle of climb is controlled by bending your knees to dip your boots into the exhaust - similar to the control vanes on a V2 rocket.

The Skyflash team say on the project's website: 'Our dream is a totally unlimited flying between the clouds. Glide with your own body... Let yourself merge with the wings.

'Two microjets let you speed through the sky with more than 200 miles per hour.

'The Skyflash shall be easily transported to your local airstrip and put together there with just a few strokes of work.

'You take off lying comfortably on your 10in off-road landing gear. After just a few moments you get airborne, harvesting the power of the two turbojet engines working in your back.

'Now everything responds to the actions of your body. A slight motion of your finger accelerates. Outstretching your arm starts a turn. Finally bend your knees and accelerate skywards.'

They add: 'Landing works the same way you took off. But until that moment has come, you share boundless freedom with nothing but the clouds and the limitless sky.

'In case of an emergency you land safely using your total recovery parachute system.

'Working for this idea is the greatest pleasure of our lives which we work for more than five years now. Please follow us if you share this aviational dream!'
