Ed Miliband faces a crucial test on the world stage next week as he is due to meet Barack Obama at the White House.

Meetings between an opposition leader and the US president are a high-stakes affair, and have been described as a ‘job interview for being prime minister’.

It is expected Mr Obama will grant Mr Miliband a short meeting on Monday, known as a ‘brush by’, during which the president will drop in on a meeting between the Labour leader and high-level US officials.

This is typical for an opposition leader and is the same level of courtesy offered to David Cameron when he met George Bush in 2008.

Mr Miliband is said to have been keen for some time to make a White House trip, in an effort to convince sceptical voters he can be prime ministerial.

But it's not known whether the leader of 
the Opposition will swing by New York afterwards to visit his brother 
David, who was last night hobnobbing with the stars.

The former Labour foreign secretary, a staunch Blairite who was beaten to party's top spot after his younger sibling secured the support of the unions, was at a summer party hosted by the International Rescue Committee, the aid organisation he has run since 2010.

The lavish event in New York City's The James Hotel drew stars including Broadway actress Laura Osnes, celebrity chef Eden Grinshpan, and Homeland actress Morena Baccarin.

Mr Miliband has been the president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee since quitting UK politics in 2010 after he was beaten in the Labour party leadership race by his brother Ed

But while David is riding high on the New York social scene, Ed's visit to Washington, which has not yet been officially confirmed, could be a media minefield. 

Neil Kinnock’s meeting with Ronald Reagan just before the 1987 general election turned to disaster when the president then publicly expressed concerns about the then Labour leader’s views on nuclear disarmament. 

Mr Miliband’s decision to scupper military action in Syria last summer may well have burned some bridges in the US.

PJ Crowley, a former aide to Mr Obama, said last week the debacle, in which David Cameron’s plan for air strikes was dramatically defeated, had left ‘bruises’ in Washington.

The Labour leader is also expected make a speech to a Washington think 
tank detailing how Labour and the Democrats think similarly about how to
 share the proceeds of economic growth.

He is said to be hoping that the links 
between the Democrats and the Labour party, as well as the fact that his
 strategist David Axelrod used to work for the president, will smooth 
the way. 

Mr Miliband has not made many diplomatic visits. His first high profile foreign trip as opposition leader earlier this year, to Israel and the Palestinian territories, was seen as successful.

Mr
 Miliband and Mr Obama have met before, when the president visited 
London in 2011 and could meet again at a Nato summit in Wales in 
September.

The ongoing crisis in Syria, and the pull-out of troops from Afghanistan, which Mr Miliband would have to oversee if he wins the next election, are likely to be high on the agenda.

The last Labour opposition leader to have a successful first trip to the White House, which paved the way for becoming prime minister, was Tony Blair in 1996.

Mr Blair’s former chief of staff Jonathan Powell recently warned that such visits have to run like clockwork, as it is ‘the nearest the leader of the opposition gets to a job interview for prime minister’.

Gordon Brown was said to have been ‘snubbed’ when he met Mr Obama at the United Nations in New York in 2009.

It was claimed the president refused five requests for a private meeting with him. They only met finally in a bizarre ‘kitchen summit’ at the UN building.
