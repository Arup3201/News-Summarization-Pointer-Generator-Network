Fraud: Ann Barnes stole more than £13,000 from the NHS by claiming two salaries

An NHS worker who defrauded the taxpayer by claiming two salaries was caught after she boasted to colleagues about buying a ballgown for her daughter and a hot tub.

Telephone operator Ann Barnes was today spared jail after a court heard she had agreed to pay back the £13,000 she was mistakenly paid thanks to a payroll error.

Her manager became suspicious when the 47-year-old went from struggling financially to bragging about her wealth, including an extension she was having built on her house.

Barnes was claiming £33,000 a year for 16.5 hours of work a week at the out-of-hours GP service, when she should have been paid £19,954.

Manager Ann Poyner said Barnes seemed to go from 'rags to riches' - claiming she was once in such dire straits she thought she would lose her home, before her problems 'seemed to disappear'.

'I offered her a bank holiday shift, thinking she would need the money because of her previous financial problems,' Ms Poyner told Cardiff Crown Court.

'I was a bit shocked when she said she couldn't work the shift because she was going for a meal with her husband.

'She said she was then going to a garden centre to look at buying a hot tub.

'After 2009 she started talking about buying an expensive ballgown for her daughter's graduation, a holiday, and having an extension built on her house.'

Barnes was subsequently arrested after Ms Poyner contacted payroll staff to check whether a mistake had been made.

The court heard that the error started in 2009, when Barnes was given a promotion and pay rise which led to two sets of salary being paid into her account.

A payroll manager spotted the double pay and queried it with Barnes, but she insisted she had two NHS jobs, and was able to carry on claiming the extra money for two years.

Barnes, of Crumlin in South Wales, admitted stealing £13,326 from the Aneurin Bevan Health Board between April 2009 and January 2011.

Robert Hawkins, defending, said Barnes had paid back all the money she took using her husband's redundancy payment, and described her as 'a woman of previously good character'.

Judge Stephen Hopkins said: 'You were clearly very highly thought of at work.

'Initially the double payment was an administrative error - but your vice was that you didn't correct it.

The fact you will repay the outstanding sum is good but you cannot pay your way out of it.

Barnes was given a five-month suspended jail sentence with 80 hours of unpaid work, and ordered to pay £1,600 investigation costs.
