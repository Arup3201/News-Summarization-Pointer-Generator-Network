Eddie Ray Routh told a ranger he shot dead famed Navy SEAL Chris Kyle because: 'If I did not take down his soul, he was going to take down mine.'

A tape of his confession was played in court in Stephenville, Texas on Monday as Routh's murder trial entered its second week. The former Marine, 27, is accused of shooting dead Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield after they took him to a gun range in February 2013 as he battled PTSD.

In the taped confession, which was taken just hours after he was arrested, Routh told Texas Ranger Danny Briley that he killed the men because he thought they were 'headhunters' who were 'trying to hunt everybody down'.

Ultimately though, he said they not as well trained as him so he was able to take them out. He shot dead Kyle first - because he recognized him more - before shooting dead Littlefield, he said.

Confession: A tape of Eddie Ray Routh's confession was played to the court in his murder trial on Monday

On the footage, he can be seen resting his head on the table before the ranger questions him about killing former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield at a gun range in 2013

Bizarre: At some points, he rambled, according to the ranger, and he also said he was sorry for the killings

'I try to be as normal and as reasonable as I can... I'm pretty damn reasonable,' he told the ranger, according to coverage by The Dallas News. 'I was reasonable and fair with them boys.'

He also revealed how he had told his sister: 'I had to kill a man today... I had to get out of that situation today'.

He also admitted to fleeing after shooting the men at the gun range. He stole Kyle's truck and was ultimately arrested by police following a high-speed chase.

'I didn't know what else to do,' he said. 'My adrenaline was pumped so high. I didn't know what was right. I didn't know what was wrong.'

Still, he showed remorse for his actions and said if he could speak to the families of his victims, he would apologize.

'I would tell them I'm so sorry for what I've done,' he said. 

In other parts of the confession, Routh, who was seen yawning at times in the interview and laying his head down in the table, rambles on about the world being a 'soulless place'.

'I've got tons of people eating on my soul right now,' he said. 'The warlords aren't very happy with me. I know that. Everyone knows that in town.'

Ranger Briley took the stand on Monday and recounted how Routh made little sense during the questioning.

Key witness: Texas Ranger Danny Briley speaks about interviewing Routh as he takes the stand on Monday

'Some of the stuff, I had no clue what we were talking about,' he said. 'I wanted to know, did you know what you were doing was wrong? Clearly, he knew what he was doing was wrong.'  

He said he knew immediately that the killings were intentional.

'This was a brutal killing,' he told the court. 'There was no question that I was dealing with someone very violent…You can't accidentally shoot someone that many times.'

Briley's testimony came after a former Secret Service agent testified about calls the men exchanged in the days leading up to the deaths - including a bizarre message Routh left on Kyle's phone. 

'Kind of a sad day when it rains,' Routh said in the voicemail. 'It's a good sad. Rain will come and rains will leave. I guess that's what they do.' 

His attorneys have claimed the defendant, who had post-traumatic stress disorder, was in a psychotic state. The voicemail message gives some insight into Routh's mental state at the time.

Jeff Shaffer, a former Secret Service agent who analyzed calls between Routh and Kyle, said Routh left four messages and spoke with Kyle several times - for up to 15 minutes - before the murders.

The other voice messages are more straightforward and show Routh asking Kyle, who often took veterans to a shooting range after they returned home, simply to give him a call back.

Shaffer also repeated text messages between Kyle and Littlefield saying that 'this dude is straight up nuts' after they took him to the shooting range. The messages were first heard last week.

On the stand: Erath County Sheriff's Deputy Kenny Phillips said on Monday that Routh was 'under the influence maybe' after he was taken into custody by officers and then detoxed while in custody

On Friday, Gene Cole, a former patrol deputy in Erath County, revealed for the first time a possible motive in the case as he took the stand.

He told the court: 'I heard Mr Routh say, 'I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me. I was just riding in the backseat of the truck, and nobody would talk to me'.' 

Also taking the stand on Friday, Routh's uncle, James Watson, described his nephew's actions in the wake of the murders - and revealed they had both smoked 'strong' marijuana beforehand.  

Watson said he smoked weed with Routh and that his buzz lasted for three hours. Authorities also said they believed Routh had consumed whiskey before leaving with Kyle and Littlefield.

While at the shooting range, he shot Kyle six times and Littlefield seven times, killing both. He then stole Kyle's truck.

When he arrived at his uncle's home and said, 'I'm driving a dead man's truck', Watson misinterpreted 'dead man' as Routh himself, he said.

'He thought people were out to get him,' Watson testified.

Routh also showed his uncle a black 9mm handgun, which was owned by Kyle and which he used to kill Littlefield at the range of Rough Creek Lodge and Resort, authorities have said.

There is no doubt over the fact that Routh was responsible for shooting Kyle, a married father-of-two with the most kills to his name in U.S. military history, and his friend.  

Instead, the defense and prosecution are trying to prove whether or not he was driven by mental illness when he carried out the murders.

Also on Friday, a ranger testified that he found whiskey, drug paraphernalia and medicine for schizophrenia in Routh's home the day of the shootings - giving some insight into his troubled life.

Routh was a small arms technician who served in Iraq and was deployed to earthquake-ravaged Haiti before leaving the Marines in 2010.

If convicted of capital murder, he faces life in prison without parole.

The case has gained national attention due to 'American Sniper' - the movie starring Bradley Cooper and based on Kyle's memoir - which was released to critical acclaim.
