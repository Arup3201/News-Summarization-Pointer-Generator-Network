Bath have welcomed Rhys Priestland’s determination to claim their No 10 shirt ahead of England’s George Ford next season after confirming that they have signed the Welshman.

The 27-year-old Scarlets fly-half will move to The Rec at the end of this season to join a growing Wales contingent in the Aviva Premiership. He has chosen to sign for Bath for a salary of £250,000-£300,000, despite having Ford as a pedigree rival.

Priestland’s move is likely to curtail his Test career after the World Cup as Wales are ready to enforce a restriction on the selection of players who agree future deals abroad while the WRU’s new dual-contract system takes effect. But his decision comes against a backdrop of abuse dished out by supporters, which was condemned by coach Shaun Edwards.

Being harshly cast as a scapegoat has evidently taken its toll on a player who has been usurped in the Wales ranks by Dan Biggar, while the Blues’ Kiwi recruit, Gareth Anscombe, is being lined up for a swift call-up to represent the land of his mother.

Yesterday, he spoke of ‘great highs and some heartfelt lows’ during his decade of first-team service to the Scarlets, his home region, while talking of his need for a ‘new challenge’, which Ford will most certainly present.

Mike Ford, the incumbent’s father and Bath’s head coach, said: ‘Rhys is a fantastic player with an impressive pedigree. He’s got a wide range of talents that suit our gameplan and he’ll make a great addition to our squad. He’s still quite a young guy, but one with a lot of experience that will be really valuable, especially in the development of our younger players.’

Another of Bath’s coaches, Toby Booth, insisted Priestland will not be coming to make up the numbers or act as a utility option, despite also having experience at full back. ‘Rhys is an international No 10 and he is coming here to play at 10,’ said Booth. 

‘He is coming here to push George and compete for that position.

‘We believe we need ultimate competition in those positions. That’s why Owen Farrell has become the player that he has — because he’s had Charlie Hodgson with him at Saracens, competing with him for that place. Rhys Priestland is coming here to be the starting-choice 10.

'That’s the conversation we had with him and he said that he wouldn’t come here if there was any other intention.’

Priestland has made 147 senior appearances for the Scarlets and is poised to overtake Stephen Jones as the Llanelli-based region’s leading points-scorer.

Head coach Wayne Pivac said: ‘He’s been a big part of the region for a long period of time. We were keen to retain Rhys but were unable to do so. His leadership qualities, experience and maturity will be missed. He goes with our blessing and he will always be a Scarlet.’
