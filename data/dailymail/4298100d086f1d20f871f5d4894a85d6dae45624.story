A French marketing campaign by Nutella has backfired after banning the word 'lesbian'.

The 'Say it with Nutella' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread, which they could then share with friends on social media.

But  the words 'lesbian', 'Jewish' and 'orangutan' are all banned from being emblazoned on the pots, it has been discovered.

The Nutella website says: 'Here you can create your custom messages and share them with those you love.'

But users realised that there is a long list of words banned, which bizarrely does not allow 'lesbian' but permits the word 'gay'.

The word 'Christian' can also be written on the jars, but other religious terms such as 'Jewish' and 'Muslim' have been banned by Nutella, Pink News reported.

Health-related terms, presumably in case any one tried to blame the hazelnut spread on obesity, have also been banned, including the words 'cancer' and 'diabetes'.

The company, owned by Ferrero, has also outlawed words which could be used to highlight their controversial ingredient palm oil, the farming of which allegedly destroys the habitats of orangutans.

This may explain why 'boycott' and 'orangutan' make the long list of banned words.

Ferrero said in a statement: 'By giving customers the opportunity to personalise their Nutella jar we want to create a way for them to share enthusiasm for the brand. 

'Negative or insulting terms were directly removed from the options field. Similarly, terms of communities that are often subject to attacks by malicious people were removed from the possibilities.' 

The news comes just a day after it emerged that Marks & Spencer had banned the words 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' from being allowed on messages sent with bouquets of flowers.

The policy emerged earlier after a customer was stopped from buying a £35 bouquet for a funeral because she said in the gift message that it was from a family in 'Christ Church Teddington'.

Lord Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, said: 'If Christ becomes an offensive word in a Christian land then all of us should be alarmed.'
