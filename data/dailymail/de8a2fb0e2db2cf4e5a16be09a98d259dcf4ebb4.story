All her life, the elderly worshipper had been inspired by her church’s fresco of Jesus with his crown  of thorns.

So when the plaster portrait began to crumble owing to damp, the woman in her 80s decided not to stand idly by.

Without consulting the authorities at the Sanctuary of Mercy Church in Borjanos, southern Spain, she marched in with oil paint and brush, and started work on her own private restoration project.

'Restored': The image bears more resemblance to a character from Planet of the Apes than to Jesus after a woman in her 80's 'repaired' it without permission

Original: Elias Garcia Martinez's 'Ecce Homo', which has been admired by worshippers at the Sanctuary of Mercy Church in Zaragoza, Spain, for more than 120 years

Damaged: Moisture in the church caused the surface of the fresco, which has huge sentimental value, to deteriorate

Quite what she thinks of her  handiwork has not been disclosed. But her fellow worshippers are horrified.

The 120-year-old fresco, Ecce Homo by
 Elijah Garcia Martinez, has been transformed into something which looks
 more like a movie werewolf.

To add to the general embarrassment, a
 local Catholic cultural foundation, the Centre for Borjanos, had 
received a donation from the granddaughter of the artist which it was 
about to spend on returning the fresco to its former glory.

As a team of experts examined the 
woman’s handiwork to see if  it can be reversed, a spokesman  for the 
centre said: ‘The value of the original work was not very  high but it 
was more of a sentimental value.

‘The lady, who is in her 80s, apparently considers herself to be an artist. She acted without authorisation from anyone.

‘The church is always open because 
many people visit and although there is a guard, no one realised what 
she was doing until she had finished.’
