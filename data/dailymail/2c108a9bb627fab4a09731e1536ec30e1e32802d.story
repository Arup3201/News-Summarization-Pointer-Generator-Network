Waiting to hear: 57,000 people are currently on police bail in Britain, including one man 42 months later

Thousands of criminal suspects are ‘left dangling’ on police bail for months before they are told if they will be charged.

More than 57,000 people are on this type of bail – where conditions are set by the police rather than the courts – including 3,000 for more than six months.

One fraud suspect is still on bail three years and seven months after being arrested, a survey found.

Many of those arrested and bailed will ultimately not face charges. In some cases, suspects are suspended from their jobs while allegations against them are investigated.

The Law Society, which represents solicitors, is calling for a 28-day limit on police bail, after which it said officers should be required to go before a magistrate to justify further bailing of a suspect.

Freedom of Information requests by BBC Radio 5 Live found at least 57,428 suspects were on bail in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, while 3,172 have been on bail for more than six months. In Scotland, bail is set by the courts, not the police.

Scotland Yard has more than 12,000 suspects on bail, including 910 for over six months. In London, a man, 45, has still not been told if he will be charged after he was arrested in October 2009 on suspicion of fraud.

Senior police officers appear divided on the issue, with Andy Trotter, the head of the British Transport Police, calling for a six-month limit on bail. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers said that bail was an ‘essential tool in securing justice’.

Richard Atkinson, chairman of the Law Society’s criminal law committee, said: ‘It is not unusual for people to be on bail for several months while fairly routine investigations meander their way to a final decision.

‘Because there is no requirement for 
the police to act within any time, there is an attitude among some 
officers of “let’s put off until tomorrow what we could have done today”
 and things are just left to drag along.’ He said one suspect accused of
 stealing a bicycle had been left on bail for seven months.

The largest number of bailed individuals are in London, with 12,178 waiting to hear from the Metropolitan Police

Civil liberties campaigners have 
condemned the excessive use of police bail, which allows officers to 
restrict suspects’ activities. This can include forcing them to live at a
 certain address, handing over their passport and making them report to a
 police station on a regular basis.

There is no time limit on how long bail can continue and how many times it can be renewed.

Earlier this month, Mr Trotter told 
The Mail on Sunday: ‘In the past, police have released people without 
bail and that hasn’t stopped us continuing the investigation, 
particularly if they are unlikely to abscond. We have re-arrested them 
at a later stage when we have had sufficient evidence. That way, they 
are not left dangling.’

But Chris Eyre, Acpo spokesman and 
chief constable of Nottinghamshire, said: ‘Police bail  is an essential 
tool in securing justice. It allows investigators to ensure every 
possible avenue is explored, while those arrested need not remain in 
custody.’

Steve White, vice-chairman of the 
Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said the 
lack of resources made it more difficult for investigations to be 
concluded quickly.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We 
continue to keep police bail provisions under review to ensure they 
strike the right balance between protecting an individual’s right to 
civil liberty and allowing police to carry out thorough criminal 
investigations.’
