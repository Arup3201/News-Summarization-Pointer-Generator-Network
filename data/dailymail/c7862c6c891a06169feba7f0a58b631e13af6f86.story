Everton manager Roberto Martinez has dismissed suggestions Chelsea could be given first refusal on his club's young players.

Christian Atsu's loan move to Goodison Park is Martinez's latest signing from Chelsea after Romelu Lukaku spent last season on loan before completing a permanent £28million move this summer.

There have been reports that, in return, Jose Mourinho and his club could be given preferential treatment should the likes of Ross Barkley and John Stones move on from Everton.

Here for the future: Roberto Martinez insists Chelsea don't have first refusal on his Everton players

Friendly: Christian Atsu's signature as well as Romelu Lukaku's suggested a partnership with Chelsea

But faced with those suggestions of a gentlemen's agreement, Martinez told several national newspapers: 'No, no, not at all.

'We have a good relationship and a professional relationship and I want to believe that they feel that they can trust us in sending players out on loan.

'I don't think that relationship goes any further. The chairman (Bill Kenwright) has been instrumental in forging that relationship more than anyone.

'He has developed that bridge between the two clubs and there is a possibility for both to use it in a good way, but there is no commitment in any sort of future deals.'

Barkley last month signed a four-year contract with his boyhood club while Stones, signed from Barnsley in January 2013, also committed his future to Everton when he penned a five-year deal last week.
