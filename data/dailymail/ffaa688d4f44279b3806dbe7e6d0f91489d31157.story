Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott was threatened with the sack yesterday after she was accused of making racist comments.

The Shadow Minister for Public Health dived disastrously into the Stephen  Lawrence debate – claiming that ‘white people love playing divide and rule’ with the black population.

Miss Abbott, the first black woman MP, was later forced to apologise for the comments posted on Twitter.

But Miss Abbott hit back saying criticism of black leaders was effectively playing into the hands of whites.

‘I understand the cultural point you are making,’ she told Miss Adewunmi.

‘But
 you are playing into a “divide and rule” agenda. White people love 
playing “divide and rule”. We should not play their game.’

Abbott's comment about 'divide and rule' caused a Twitter storm and led to calls for her resignation

Miss Abbott responded, saying that her comment had been 'taken out of context'

She then accused white people of peddling a ‘tactic as old as colonialism’.

Miss
 Abbott immediately faced calls to resign. Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi said if
 a white politician had made similar comments about blacks they would 
have had to quit.

Sophy Ridge: Can you understand the consternation that your tweet has created?

Diane Abbott: Well I was actually referring to the nature of 19th century European colonialism, but that's a bit much to go into 140 characters

SR: But if you look at it out of context, saying 'white people love to divide and rule' is a pretty controversial remark if people don't see it in context. Do you accept that it was not a wise thing to put out there?

DA: I think the tweet was taken out of context and some people have interpreted it maliciously

SR: Well, explain to us then, and for our viewers who are talking about this and there's a lot of Twitter activity going on, explain to us what you actually meant by it

Abbott's phone had started ringing and, indicating to Miss Ridge, she said 'Can I just...' before walking off camera.

‘It is 
outrageous,’ he said. ‘If this was reversed I guarantee you a white 
politician would have to resign their frontbench  position or be sacked 
and I think she should do the honourable thing and go. To hold views 
that white people play games of divide and rule is  blatantly racist.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg dismissed her comments as ‘stupid and crass generalisation’.

But
 Miss Abbott, who has a  history of making racially-charged statements, 
initially refused to back down. In a Twitter message and a brief TV 
interview she insisted her words had been ‘taken out of context’. The 
unrepentant MP even sought to claim she was talking about the ‘nature of
 19th century European colonialism’ rather than modern Britain.

But
 while she was on camera, she took a phone call from Mr Miliband, who 
told her she had let down both him and the Labour Party and he demanded 
that she make a public apology.

Minutes
 later she issued a new statement saying: ‘I understand people have 
interpreted my comments as making generalisations about white people. I 
do not believe in doing that. I apologise for any offence caused.’

A
 Labour Party spokesman said it was ‘wrong’ to make such ‘sweeping 
generalisations’ while Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna said: ‘The
 contents of the tweet were clearly unacceptable’

A
 senior Labour source said: ‘If we thought she really believed what was 
in the tweet, she would be off the front bench, but she doesn’t and she 
has apologised. Ed made it clear that unless she apologised she would 
have been fired.’

Marc 
Wadsworth, an executive at black newspaper The Voice said: ‘She could 
have phrased what she said better by saying that some white leaders have
 played divide and rule.’

Miss
 Abbott’s views on race issues have upset the Labour leadership before. 
In 1988 she told a black studies conference in Philadelphia that ‘the 
British invented racism’.

And in 1996 she attacked her local hospital for employing ‘blonde, blue-eyed’ Finnish nurses.

The
 daughter of West Indian migrants, she escaped her working class roots 
through an education at Harrow County Grammar School, where she acted in
 a play opposite Michael Portillo, the ex-Tory MP who ended up as her 
sparring partner on BBC1’s This Week show.

Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi took to Twitter to say that Abbott should resign or be sacked by Ed Miliband

Former shadow minister Paul Goodman also called for Abbott to stand down or face the consequences

Duncan Bannatyne said that he believes Diane Abbott's displayed a lack of common sense

How empire builders used divide and rule

Today's Twitter storm is the latest in a number of blunders made by the MP who positioned herself as an anti-racism campaigner, once claiming that Britain had 'invented racism'.

In 2010 Abbott called David Cameron and Nick Clegg 'two posh white boys', sparking claims of racism on the BBC's internet message boards. One wrote: 'I am sure that if a posh white person sat on this programme and mentioned a colour comment like that, there would be uproar.' 

The same year, she was criticised 
over remarks she made on BBC's This Week over her decision to send her 
son James to a private school. Andrew Neil quoted her saying that 'West Indian mums will go to the wall for their children'.

Mr Neil responded by asking: 'So black mums love their kids more than white mums, do they?'

Furious Abbott said: 'I have said everything I am going to say about where I send my son to school.'

Previously, Abbott face accusations of racism suggesting that the 'blonde blue-eyed Finnish girls' working in her local hospital were unsuitable as nurses because they had 'never met a black person before'.

Abbott has positioned herself as an anti-racism campaigner and once claimed that Britain had 'invented racism'.

The latest row follows a previous race controversy on the same show, fronted by Andrew Neil, last year, after he compared Abbott to a chocolate HobNob biscuit.
