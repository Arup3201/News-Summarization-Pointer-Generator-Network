An Indian dentist who died after a miscarriage was told she could not have an abortion in Ireland because a doctor told her 'this is a Catholic country', her widower claimed.

Savita Halappanavar was 17 weeks pregnant when admitted to University Hospital Galway on October 21 last year and died a week later from suspected septicaemia, days after she lost her baby.

The 31-year-old's widower, Praveen, told an inquest that they repeatedly requested a potentially life-saving termination but were refused because the foetal heartbeat was present.

Consultant Dr Katherine Astbury 
reportedly told the couple: 'We are bound by the law. We cannot 
terminate the foetus when it’s still alive’

Widowed: Praveen Halappanavar, the husband of Savita Halappanavar, arrives for the inquest into her death at Galway Coroners court

Dentist Savita Halappanavar died of septicaemia a week after miscarrying 17 weeks into her pregnancy. Her husband Praveen Halappanavar is now looking for answers

Mr Halappanavar said his wife cried and told the doctor she was Hindu and not an Irish citizen, but Dr Astbury just told the couple that she was 'sorry'.

The widower told the inquest his wife was in a great deal of pain and in shock after being told that the foetus was still alive.

When he arrived for the first day of evidence, Mr Halappanavar said the last few days had been difficult as the couple's baby had been due on March 30 - the day he was handed a health service report into his wife's death.

'We have faith in the inquest, so hopefully we will get the answers,' he said.

'The big question is why was Savita treated the way she was not supposed to be? We just want to know why she died.'

The inquest at the courthouse in Galway city is scheduled to last at least a week.

Medics involved in the treatment Mrs Halappanavar will be called to give evidence along with experts including former master of the National Maternity Hospital Dr Peter Boylan.

Proud: The couple were at the heart of the Indian community in Galway and married in 2007

Mr Halappanavar has insisted that an abortion was refused during the miscarriage and at one point the couple were told it was because Ireland 'is a Catholic country'.

The widower said: 'All I want is to get to the bottom of it, to the truth, so (I’m) looking forward to it.'

Mr Halappanavar said he could feel his late wife’s presence.

Probe: Coroner Dr Ciaran McLoughlin arrives for the inquest into the death of Mrs Halappanavar at Galway Coroners court

'She has always been there and it always feels that she has been there and I get the strength from her,' he said.

'It’s going to be a very tough day. The last few days have been very rough.'

He added: 'I’ve been confident right from day one that we will get to the truth, I want the truth, so we will just have to wait and see.'

More than 50 statements have been furnished by health chiefs and gardai for the coroner, Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin.

Mr Halappanavar, a 34-year-old engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, has so far refused to co-operate with separate investigations by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) and the Health Service Executive’s clinical review.

Lawyers have not ruled out taking the Irish Government to the European courts in pursuit of a public inquiry after the inquest.

Mr Halappanavar was said to be unsatisified with the draft findings of the HSE’s clinical review, which was handed to him on Good Friday.

It revealed there was an over-emphasis on the need not to intervene while there was a foetal heartbeat and that staff failed to recognise and diagnose the life-threatening infection in time.

It also reportedly found confusion among medical teams on the interpretation of Irish law on abortion.

The HSE has apologised over the treatment given to Mrs Halappanavar.

Opening the inquest in the packed courtroom, Dr MacLoughlin extended his sympathies and condolences to Mr Halappanavar and his family in India and vowed to undertake the inquiry with respect, courtesy and dignity in memory of his wife

He told the jury of six men and five women that the inquest was a fact-finding exercise, with no prosecution or defence.

He said more than 60 statements, 
including some from hospital staff, gardai, pathologists, a consultant 
obstetrician and a microbiologist had been taken, but not all would 
appear as witnesses.

'Savita died in tragic circumstances,' Dr MacLoughlin said.

'The family of Savita, in the presence of her husband, have suffered a very traumatic experience.'

The
coroner asked for sensitivity, time and understanding to be shown by 
everyone as if they themselves had been bereaved in similar 
circumstances.

Mr Halappanavar is listed as the fourth witness to give evidence.

As Mr Halappanavar prepared to give 
evidence, the coroner revealed that the widower had called him from 
India while attending his wife’s funeral to ask him to investigate her 
death.

The protestors were demanding changes to Ireland's strict abortion laws, which they blamed for Mrs Halappanavar's untimely death

He gave his statement to gardai two days after he returned to Ireland amid fears that his memory would fade, the inquest heard.

Mr Halappanavar read his statement to the court.

He said he moved to Ireland in 2006 and a year later he married Savita in a Hindu ceremony in India.

When she moved to Ireland they travelled around the country. 'She found Ireland so peaceful compared to the hustle and bustle of India,' he told the court.

Mr Halappanavar said the couple had always planned to have a baby in 2012.

'It worked out well that Savita had completed her exams,' he said. 'When we found out she was pregnant in July 2012 we were delighted and she rang her friends for advice on what to do next.'

Protest: There were also demonstrations in India against the Irish government over the death

He said his wife was in excellent health, athletic, did yoga, and had no need to visit a GP before her pregnancy.

Mr Halappanavar said when the couple went for their first scan at the hospital in September 2012 they were told their baby was due on March 30 and that the pregnancy was doing well.

'Savita shed tears of happiness when she saw the baby on the monitor,' he said.

Mr Halappanavar said from the outset of the pregnancy his wife had lower back pain, which she had suffered from since college and from standing for long periods of time while she worked as a dentist in India.

His wife’s parents visited from India and held a baby shower to celebrate, but her pain got so bad that she went back to the hospital on September 20. Her blood pressure, heart rate and urine were checked.

'The doctor said there was nothing to worry about and sent us back home,' Mr Halappanavar said.

'Savita had tears in her eyes when she heard the baby was OK,' he added.

'She was anxious and was relieved when she heard the heartbeat was OK.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
