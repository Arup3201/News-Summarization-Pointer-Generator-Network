A woman who found eleven hidden cameras in her apartment today blamed her landlord for the devices and accused him of spying on her.

The 25-year-old woman first noticed the hidden cameras when a visiting co-worker noticed that her smoke detector looked just like one from the box of spy cameras disguised as detectors that he had noticed in the basement of Freaks On Troost, the business where they both work.

When police arrived at her home above a tattoo parlor in Kansas City, Missouri, they found four similar smoke detectors in the kitchen, living room, hallway, and her bedroom.

A woman thinks her landlord, who is also her boss, is responsible for the 11 secret cameras that cops found hidden in her apartment above the Freaks On Troost tattoo parlor in Kansas City, Missouri, where she works

All four detectors had suspicious wires attached that led police to the discovery of a computer monitor in the building’s basement.

When police turned on the monitor at least eleven screens appeared; four of them blank from the cameras that had already been removed.

The woman believes her 47-year-old landlord/boss is to blame and may have been spying on her since October 2013, when she went out-of-town and he decided to ‘remodel her bathroom.’

She told police that her landlord had asked her out and propositioned her several times, which she had always declined.

Cops found four cameras in the bathroom, including two were concealed in the wall and pointed toward the shower

Detectives went to find the other seven cameras, three of which were discovered in the victim's bedroom.

They remainder were found in the bathroom, two were concealed in the wall and pointed toward the shower, reports the Kansas City Star.

The other two were concealed in the sink vanity’s decorative trim and had a clear view of the toilet, according to the police report.

The Kansas City Police Department Sex Crimes division is investigating further. Detectives have confiscated all the cameras and the computer and are reviewing them for evidence.

No charges had been filed so far and so no identities are being released at this time.

The creepy setup has parallels with the 1993 Sharon Stone movie Sliver in which the owner of the building has surveillance cameras allowing him to spy on every apartment

The victim, who had been living in the apartment since last summer, has moved out.

Mail Online has reached out to Freaks On Troost for comment.
