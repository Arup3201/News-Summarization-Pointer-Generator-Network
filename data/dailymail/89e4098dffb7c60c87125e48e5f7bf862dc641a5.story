You would think that it is something that they already have aplenty, but authorities in Dubai has bought a shipload of sand.

The Arab emirate is set to receive 1,500-square-metres of specially sifted sand from Germany, which is to be used on the oil rich city's famous racecourse. 

The local sand is allegedly too unstable for horses to race on, so Dubai is transporting the right type of sand all the way from central Europe. 

Sandy business: Desert city Dubai has bought 1,500-square-metres of specially sifted sand from Germany

Officials at Dubai's race tracks and training yards say local sand is 'too coarse' for their multi-million pound thoroughbreds.

The owner of German aggregates company Equiterra says he thought it was a practical joke when they were approached by Dubai. 

The firm's owner Udo Ellekotten, 48, said: 'When we got the first phone call we thought it was a practical joke about selling sand to Dubai.'

He added: 'We quickly realised, however, that it wasn't, and we're very proud that such a distinguished client chose us.'

Experts say the sand being supplied is particularly good for horses because it is not abrasive, it is firm underfoot, and highly absorbent.

Ellekotten explained: 'Local sand is large-grained and rough. It is very bad for horses and is unstable to ride on.'

One of the more famous horse races in Dubai is the Dubai World Cup, a thoroughbred horse race held annually since 1996 and contested at the Meydan Racecourse in the United Arab Emirates city.
