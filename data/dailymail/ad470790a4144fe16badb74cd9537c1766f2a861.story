An unnamed woman has become the latest person to come forward and claim she was physically abused by New Mexican authorities after being forced to undergo invasive surgery to prove she wasn’t carrying drugs.

The latest alleged victim claims she was sexually assaulted and that federal agents and medical staff exceeded their authority to search for drugs she didn’t have.

The woman was stopped by police in El Paso, Texas, after a drug-sniffing dog indicated that she might have drugs.

Police then strip-searched her and allegedly assault her by sticking their fingers into her vagina.

When the on-site search failed to turn up any drugs, police took the woman to University Medical Center of El Paso. There, she was given an X-ray, cat scan and full body search.

Medical personnel probed her anus and vagina, her lawyer Laura Schaur Ives of the New Mexico chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union told KOB4.

‘They then did a cavity search and they probed her vagina and her anus, they described in the medical records as bi-manual - two-handed,’ she said. ‘Again, they found nothing.’

Schaur claims that police did not have a warrant to conduct the search, which was the latest such alleged incident to emerge in recent days.

The other alleged victims are Timothy Young and David Eckert, who were both pulled over for traffic violations in separate incidents in Oct 2012 and Jan 2013 respectively.

They were searched on the authority of the same drug-sniffing dog, called Leo. No drugs were found in the possession of either man.

Both Young and Eckert were then taken to Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City, New Mexico, where doctors performed a full battery of invasive medical procedures including cavity searches, x-ray scans and digital anal probes.

While these incidents involved New Mexico police, the woman who Schaur represents was allegedly handled by Customs and Border Control.

All three victims protested their treatment at the hands of police and medical staff and refused to be examined. Not only were their protestations ignored, but in Eckert’s case, doctors he was given the bill for his own forced colonoscopy.
