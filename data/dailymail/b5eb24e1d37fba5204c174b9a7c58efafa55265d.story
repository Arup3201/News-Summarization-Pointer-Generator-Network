A teen who was acquitted of killing his stepbrother three years ago has admitted snorting meth to cops after being arrested for the third time in a week - including twice in the same day.

Josh Young, 18, from Louisville, Kentucky, was caught by police just before midnight on Wednesday trespassing on someone else's property.

Earlier in the day his neighbors had called 911 after they reported seeing him waving his arms in the middle of the street and trying to get into random cars.

Police said Young later confessed he had been snorting meth and he claimed someone was chasing him, reports WHAS11.

He has been charged with trespassing and public intoxication and is expected to be arraigned on both of Wednesday's arrests on Thursday morning.

Young had also been arrested last weekend after shoplifting $14.71 in merchandise from Walmart.

The troubled teen was only released from jail two weeks ago for assaulting his girlfriend in April. 

These new charges will likely mean a probation violation on a previous charge where Young pleaded guilty to assaulting a man who testified against him at his murder trial.

Young had previously been acquitted in the murder of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, in May 2011.

In his recent mug shots, Young has sported several facial tattoos - a tear under his left eye and a star near his right eye. 

Terry Zwicker, father of murdered Trey, told WDRB that he thought the tear signified that Young had killed someone and the star that he was a gang member.

He faced trial in August 2013 but was acquitted on the charge of complicity to murder and one count of tampering with physical evidence.

His father, Josh Gouker, was sentenced to life in prison in July 2013 after pleading guilty to the murder. He had initially told police that Young had confessed to the killing but changed his story.

At the time he said of the murder: 'It just felt right. I know it sounds monstrous and all that s***, but it's not. If we was in the Old Testament, it'd be the same thing.'

Gouker has since claimed that he lied when he took responsibility for Zwicker's death and has attempted to appeal his conviction.

Zwicker's devastated father told WLKY in April that he found out about the teen's run-ins with the law on Facebook.

'I feel strongly that our justice system got it wrong. I know the little boy. I know the little boy has violent tendencies. I've known him most of his life.

'This just goes to show that that somebody made a mistake somewhere and now there's a young lady that's been hurt because of it,' said Terry Zwicker.

He added to WDRB that he still believes Young should be locked up.

'He deserves to pay for what he's done and not only what he's done to that young lady. He deserves to pay for the murder of my child. I'm not stupid.

'I know the boy did it. I feel it in my bones that he did it so this just goes to show the jury was wrong by letting him go and now somebody else is hurt,' he said.

Trey Zwicker, 14, was discovered beaten to death behind Liberty High School three years ago.
