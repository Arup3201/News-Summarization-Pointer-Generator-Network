This is the dramatic moment two walkers were forced to cling to each other with a shepherd's crook after getting stranded on a steep slope on a Scottish mountain.

The pair had to be rescued by a Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter after getting into difficulty when a path disintegrated beneath them as they climbed Harts Fell, near Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway.

A Royal Navy Sea King helicopter, from HMS Gannet at Prestwick, was scrambled to their rescue after they managed to raise the alarm from the  top of the precipitous incline.

They were left in a precarious position after getting into difficulty but managed to call for help. A Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter was sent from HMS Gannet at Prestwick and the pair were winched to safety

When the helicopter arrived on scene, one man was found sitting at the top of the steep slope while the other was lying down on the rocky ground below, holding onto his friend's shepherd's crook.

He had been clinging to the crook for 45 minutes by the time rescuers arrived at around 11.50am yesterday. 

The helicopter, which had diverted from a training mission to help the stricken pair, was forced to hover 100ft above the men to avoid dislodging any of the ground while they were winched on board.

They were flown to a nearby farm where they were said to be uninjured but 'shaken' by the incident.  

Lieutenant Commander Jon Green, pilot and duty aircraft commander, said: 'We had to get as near to them as we could, so that we could safely winch our aircrewman down, but, because we knew that they were not only on unstable ground, but that one of them was holding the other by his crook, we had to keep the hover as high as possible to avoid dislodging either the people or the scree with the downwash from the helicopter.

'With the low cloud base, however, this was very difficult. 

The pair were rescued from Hart Fell, in the Moffat Hills (above), which is 2,651ft high and popular with walkers

'There was no question of our aircrewman chief petty officer Shaun 'Boogie' Knights detaching from the winch - the conditions underfoot were just too unpredictable.

'So, we had to put ourselves into a steady hover about 100ft directly above them both.

'Boogie went down on the wire and managed to quickly secure a strop around the lower of the two men, before recovering him to the aircraft.

'The same procedure was repeated for his walking partner.'

The stranded walkers raised the alarm at 11.05am yesterday and had been returned to safety by 12.20pm.

Both were said to be experienced and well-equipped when they started their trek on Hart Fell, which is  2,651ft and a popular climb with hikers.
