It might not be to everyone's taste, but a retired GP has amassed the largest collection of British surrealist art in the country.

Former Conservative councillor Dr Jeffrey Sherwin has a house in Alwoodley, Leeds, full of works by the likes of Roland Penrose and Merlyn Evans.

Among his collection is an interesting sculpture of legs in a bucket by artist Richard Niman and a stone-carved face by FE McWilliam.

Collection: Former Conservative councillor Dr Jeffrey Sherwin has a house in Alwoodley, Leeds, full of frames with bright colours and odd shapes

In his collection: A 1950 artwork by Conroy Maddox called St Lucy (left) and a 1941 piece by Toni Del Renzio called Paranoiac Regression (right)

Also included is a man's head with a false beak on a pole by John Davies - and now the art is going on show at Abbot Hall Gallery in Kendal, Cumbria.

Dr Sherwin, 78, who is married to Ruth, 71, told The Guardian: 'I'm just an ordinary bloke buying pictures I could afford.

'Because British surrealism wasn't 
particularly highly regarded by the critics, it was never very expensive
 and I could afford to buy it.'

Dr Sherwin also described his collection of 300 pieces of artwork to BBC News as ‘modest by collectors' standards such as Charles Saatchi’.

Surrealism: This 1957 oil on canvis by Desmond Morris, entitled There's No Time Like The Future, is part of the 78-year-old retired doctor's collection

Eerie: Twilight Symphony, a 1954 oil on board artwork by John Banting, forms part of The Sherwin Collection, which has been amassed over 25 years

Some of his artwork has been loaned to the Tate in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and other galleries in Spain, Germany and France.

He added: 'I've promised my wife I won't buy anything again. Although every time I say this she smiles.'

Dr and Mrs Sherwin first started collecting after visiting a gallery in 1986 marking the 50th anniversary of Britain’s first surrealist exhibition.

He said when he was considering spending £1,000 on 1948 print The Chess Players by Merlyn Evans, his ‘fingers perspired' with fear.

Amassed: Angel of Mercy, a 1934 creation by Eileen Agar (left), and a piece of art from the following year by Sir John Selby-Bigge called Tyrolean Dreams

Colourful: Unsleeping Beauty, a 1946 oil on canvas by Roland Penrose, which refers to the Arizona landscape seen by the artist

But that became the couple's first purchase - and they soon built up a strong collection, which also includes a painting by pop artist Sir Peter Blake.

However he is unable to choose a favourite piece from his collection, telling The Guardian: ‘It would be like choosing a favourite child’.

The Abbot Hall Gallery’s description of Dr Sherwin’s exhibition - which runs until June 21 - praises its ‘diversity of styles and imagery’.

It adds: ‘Surrealism has never had a single overriding visual aesthetic, and has constantly reinvented its means of poetic expression.’
