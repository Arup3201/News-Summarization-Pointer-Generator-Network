Victoria Beckham is one of the most enigmatic figures in showbiz. We know the facts of her public profile - as Posh Spice, Mrs Beckham or world-renowned fashion designer. Yet we know little about what makes this woman tick. But that could all be about to change.

The successful mother-of-four is treating fans to a glimpse into her world as she teams up with Skype to tell the story of her burgeoning fashion label.

The behind-the-scenes footage, which will begin broadcast in the New Year, will show Victoria 'in a previously unseen way', according to Skype.

Victoria as you've never seen her before: Beckham is joining forces with Skype to broadcast behind-the-scenes footage in the run up to her AW14 show

A statement released today said: 'Skype will enable access to key milestones in her business, a behind-the-scenes view of how the company is run, an introduction to the team that Victoria has taken with her from the start, as well as the industry collaborators who have joined her along the way.'

The footage will also 'highlight the journey of successful entrepreneur and creative professional and her global luxury fashion brand' as she presents her designs at New York Fashion Week in February 2014.

After her show, the 39-year-old will 
partake in an 'In Conversation With' session whereby a panel - made up 
of members of the public - will be able to ask Victoria questions about 
her work.

Her husband David was full of praise for his fashion designer wife at the premiere of new documentary, The Class Of '92, at London's Odeon West End in Leicester Square on Sunday night.

The
 star paid an emotional tribute to his wife and family, saying: 'I'm 
always proud of her - of everything that she's achieved.'

'She's a very talented girl and, you know, we've got four amazing kids and we're very proud of them.'

The fashion mogul this month unveiled a tightly edited selection of the most popular pieces from her Spring/Summer 2009 collection onwards.

But
 never one to take a day off, Victoria has already released a new 
handbag, the Quincy, as well as  revealing her AW13 and pre 
S/S14 collections.
