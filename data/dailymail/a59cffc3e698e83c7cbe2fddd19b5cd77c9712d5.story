Like mother, like daughter, so the saying goes and Jane and Kristy Lowe are certainly proving it to be true.

Thier family, from Sheffield, South Yourkshire, had suffered years of heartbreak but it seems their fortunes are finally changing after both mum and daughter landed modeling contracts on the same day.

The pair were both signed by DK Model Management last month after a spell of bad luck, which included Jane, 47, having her skull smashed to pieces when she was hit by a bus.

Since 2009, the pair from Sheffield, South Yorks, also endured a close family bereavement and discovered husband and dad Steve had throat cancer, causing nearly five years of misery for the family.

Kristy, 20, said: 'It comes after a lot of bad luck, but we have come through it and everything has changed.

'It’s all a bit of a shock, and none of my friends can believe it.

'It just doesn’t happen to normal people, or so we thought. We always considered ourselves an unlucky family but we have survived and that is a great piece of luck.'

After competing in the Miss South Yorkshire contest, Kristy, an interior design student at Northumbria University, scooped the award on February 14 at the Hilton hotel in Sheffield, following a series of grueling rounds.

Then she was approached by DK Model Management, who offered her a modeling contract, despite having already unknowingly approached Jane earlier in the evening.

Jane, a mortgage processor, said: “We couldn’t believe it when we realised we had both been asked. They had no idea we were related, I’d just been there to support Kristy.

'I’d never imagined doing anything like that before. They were looking for more mature models, and they asked me if I was interested.

'I’ve done shoots wearing office wear, casual, dressed up and gym wear, and there’s a chance Kristy and I could end up doing something together.'

It's a big turnaround for Jane, who was hit by a First Mainline bus in March 2010 while crossing the road in Sheffield city centre.

After being thrown 40 feet into the air and landing on the side of her head, doctors feared she would not survive, and she had to have a titanium plate fitted into the right hand side of her face.

Jane said: “It was a single decker bus which knocked me down. It was a matter of seconds and I had the phone to my ear but I don’t remember anything else.

'I was looking to the left and I thought it was one-way so I didn’t see the bus, and the driver didn’t think to slow down.

'He’d only just set off and had only gone about 40 yards and he was travelling at around 40mph.

'The next thing I knew I was in hospital, and everything hurt.'

During the accident, Jane’s front tooth punctured her lip and the bone in the whole left side of her face was smashed into thousands of tiny fragments.

She was also left with a fractured pelvis and cheekbones, yet she suffered no internal injuries.

She said: 'I looked like I’d had a stroke, and they had to completely rebuild the side of my face.

'Afterwards I couldn’t dress myself or bend at all and I had to have a wheelchair for the first few weeks.

'The work they did on my face is incredible. Even if you look at me close up, you can’t tell what I went through.'

In 2010 Jane was crossing a road in Sheffield when she was hit by a bus. She had to have extensive work done to repair the bones in her head and face.

Jane and Steve, a 47-year-old detective sergeant, went to the Miss South Yorkshire pageant to support Kristy during the final last month, along with sister Samantha, 17.

After being scouted in a nightclub in Newcastle, she impressed judges at the final during the eco, fitness and ball-gown rounds.

Kristy said: 'I was out on a night out with my friends when I was approached. It’s not the sort of thing I would usually do as I’m not a very confident person but I gave him my details and then got an email through a few days later.

'I soon realised they focus on so much more than just looks, like being fit and healthy and having a personality.

'I was a bit skeptical at first but I have never met a nicer group of girls and we had so much fun.

'All of them were so nice and they were all screaming and shouting for me when I won. I never even expected to get to the final round and to win it was amazing.'

Kristy has automatically secured herself a place in the Miss England contest in June, as well as looking forward to a part-time modeling career.

She said: 'I can’t believe it. I now spend my weeks doing photo shoots!

'The whole thing has been a massive confidence booster for me, and I’ve really enjoyed it. I’m really looking forward to doing some modeling as I think it’s going to be a lot of fun.'

DK Model Management is a commercial agency, which specialises in providing models of all ages for magazine and TV adverts, and promotes products rather than fashion.

Kathy Holdsworth, managing director of DK Model Management, said: “I actually saw Jane before I saw Kristy because she was there on the evening of the Miss South Yorkshire final.

'She is very slim and attractive and she had a lovely dress on.

'I was one of the judges and the minute I saw Kristy I knew I wanted her to win, but you just don’t know what the others are thinking. I was delighted when she was announced as the winner.

'It was only when I saw Kristy with her parents that I realised they were related. The whole family are such delightful people and this could not have happened to a nicer family.

'I couldn’t believe that half of Jane’s face was made of titanium. It was hard to even see the tiny scars, the surgeon must have had incredible skill.

'When Kristy’s father told us of the terrible time the family have had, where they have suffered three blows in a row, I was so delighted that following all of this, the family now had a great reason to celebrate, and I had gained two lovely new models.'

Better times: Mum Jane, 47 and daughter Kristy, 20, are now both models and hope they can work together.
