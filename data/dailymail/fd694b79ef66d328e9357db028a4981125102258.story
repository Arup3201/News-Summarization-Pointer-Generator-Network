Colorado Rockies star Todd Helton has been arrested on a charge of driving under the influence as he went on a late-night run for lottery tickets, it has been reported.

The first baseman was taken into custody by police at a Thornton, Colorado, gas station close to his home at about 2:30am on Wednesday.

Cops had been called after another motorist spotted Helton, who was behind the wheel of his Ford F-150 that the caller claimed had struck a median before parking at the gas station.

In it to win it: Helton was reportedly clutching two lottery tickets when he was arrested for DUI early on Wednesday morning

There, police observed Helton as he staggered out of the gas station. He smelled of alcohol and was clutching the lottery tickets in his hand, according to a police report obtained by TMZ.

Helton reportedly told the officers that he never hit the median, but 'made spontaneous statements about drinking two Igloo cups of red wine.'

Helton's blood-alcohol content was over the legal limit but police have not released the number.

He was charged with three counts of DUI, but police noted that he was 'respectful and professional throughout the entire process,' according to TMZ.

In a statement released yesterday by the Rockies, Helton said: 'Last evening I exercised poor judgment and was charged with drinking and driving after driving to a gas station near my house.

'I am very sorry and embarrassed by my actions. I hold myself to a high standard and take my responsibility as a public figure very seriously. My entire career I have worked to set a positive example for my family and in our community and I fell far short of this standard.'

Veteran: Helton, 39, missed most of the 2012 baseball season but is expected to return this year for his 17th Major League season

He added: 'I sincerely ask my family, the Colorado Rockies Organization, Major League Baseball and the community to accept my apology. I make no excuses and accept full responsibility for my actions. I humbly ask your forgiveness.'

Nicknamed 'the Toddfather,' Helton is a career .320 hitter. The 39-year-old played only 69 games last year before undergoing hip surgery in August.

He is expected to return this year for his 17th Major League season.

Helton signed a two-year, $9.9million contract extension to stay with the team in 2010.
