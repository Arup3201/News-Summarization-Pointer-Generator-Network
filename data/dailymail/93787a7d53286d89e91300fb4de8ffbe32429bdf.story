British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher still has no monument in her home town

Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the death of the most influential peacetime Prime Minister in British history.

Take a walk through Margaret Thatcher’s hometown, though, and you could be forgiven for thinking she hadn’t spent her formative years here.

Yes, there’s a plaque on her childhood home, the greengrocer’s owned by her father, Alfred Roberts, Grantham’s mayor in 1946. But it could hardly be smaller — high up on the first floor, barely legible from the pavement. And it isn’t even one of the official blue plaques normally granted to the great and the good.

Today, her childhood home is a health clinic, Living Health, specialising in ‘chiropractic, natural therapies and beauty’. In the shop window, a large poster offers a treatment to ‘tone, slim and detox’ you with a marine algae bodywrap.

One wall of Alfred Roberts’s old shop is given over to an advert that reads: ‘Gift Vouchers Available Here — Give the Gift of Relaxation.’ Lady Thatcher had many gifts — the art of relaxation wasn’t one of them.

In Grantham’s pretty town centre, there is nothing to remind you of the person who changed the face of Britain.

On the green, there’s a statue to Grantham’s most famous son — Sir Isaac Newton. Opposite is the Isaac Newton Shopping Centre. There’s another plaque marking the spot where Newton lodged as a schoolboy. And there are two more Newton plaques outside King’s Grammar School, where he was head boy.

A few yards away, there is a bronze statue to the Honourable Frederick Tollemache, Grantham’s Liberal MP, on and off, from 1826 until 1874. The inscription reads: ‘Erected in 1891 by the friends who revered his memory, irrespective of political opinions.’

I mean no disrespect to Mr Tollemache but, even in the 19th century, he wasn’t much of a name to conjure with in British politics. Certainly nothing compared with the town’s colossally famous, most distinguished daughter. Even her most fervent supporters might not rank Margaret Thatcher alongside the man who discovered gravity. But surely she deserves a statue at least as much as Frederick Tollemache.

If this were America — where Thatcher is revered more than she is in Britain — Grantham would be the equivalent of a presidential birthplace. Every hotel, tea shop and pub would be plastered with Thatcher references. The town signs would be emblazoned with her name; her childhood home would be bought up by admirers, and thronged with pilgrims.

But not in modern Britain.

On two recent visits to Grantham, I had the pavement outside her childhood home to myself, for half an hour each time, as I took photographs.

So thank God, then, for two women who, off their own bat, have determined to leave a Thatcherite stamp on the town that made her.

The first is Helen Goral, chairman of Grantham Museum. Three years ago, the museum was in a terrible way, with Lincolnshire County Council unable to afford its upkeep. It had a Thatcher display, but it was woeful — not much more than one of her handbags and  a pair of her shoes.

Enter Helen and a team of volunteers, who took over the running of the museum as a community heritage association in 2011, and reinvigorated the Thatcher display.

The museum remains small but now has some real gems: including the dinner jacket worn by Alfred Roberts in his mayoral year, and an utterly characteristic royal blue dress and handbag, donated from Lady Thatcher’s personal wardrobe.

There’s a copy of Handel’s Messiah, owned by a 15-year-old Margaret Roberts in 1940, and the programme for the 1937 Grantham and District Eisteddfod, in which she performed. Most intriguing is the hockey stick Margaret used to wield at Kesteven and Grantham Girls’ School, where she was head girl.

When she left, her hockey stick, and her school uniform, were passed on to Ann Nidd, a young neighbour, just starting at the school. Scratched into the head of the hockey stick are two names, ‘M. Roberts’ and ‘A. Nidd’.

The museum also has a copy of Thatcher’s memoirs, inscribed by her with the words: ‘From this town I learnt so much and am proud to be one of its citizens.’

But still, the streets of Grantham are empty of any tribute to its proud daughter. But, with luck and a little money, not for long.

On March 8, 2013 — coincidentally, exactly a month before Lady Thatcher’s death — Helen Goral started an appeal to raise £100,000 for a Lady Thatcher statue, and another £100,000 for further improvements to the Thatcher display at the museum.

Much of the money collected has come from Grantham locals. Helen says they are still ‘two big donations’ away from achieving their goal.

‘We didn’t consider applying for government funds,’ she says. ‘Private donations are much more in line with Lady Thatcher’s beliefs.

‘This is a project for the community, but it shouldn’t be taxpayer-funded. Lady Thatcher wouldn’t have wanted council tax to be spent on a statue. She’d have said that the money could be better spent elsewhere.’

Helen is chair of the advisory panel that will determine what the statue looks like. Three prospective poses have been considered — two standing, one sitting — but no final decision has been made.

The plan is for the statue to go inside the museum or stand on the green. Between Isaac Newton and Frederick Tollemache is a perfect stretch of grass just waiting for her.

‘People are concerned about the potential of vandalism,’ says Helen, ‘It depends on planning, too, but I’d prefer it to be outside.’

Of course it must go outside, even at the considerable risk of vandalism — another statue of Margaret Thatcher was decapitated by a thug at the Guildhall Art Gallery in 2002.

But even that attack was a kind of tribute, I thought at the time — who’d bother to decapitate a statue of John Major or Gordon Brown?

The second woman to strike a blow for Margaret Thatcher’s memory in Grantham is sculptor Lisa Hawker. As of last Friday, her charming bronze bust of Lady Thatcher has taken pride of place in Grantham Museum’s main hall. It shows Margaret Thatcher, with a slight smile, in the early Eighties, when she was in her 50s and her prime.

Lisa based the work on video footage and old photographs to ‘absorb her personality’. Then she spent several months moulding Lady T in clay before casting her in bronze.

The bust — which is at the museum on a free loan — will be on show until the end of the month.

Lisa says she was inspired to do the bust because of negative reaction to Thatcher after her death. ‘She deserved respect after she died — I thought it was absolutely shocking how she was treated. 

‘People weren’t getting the person behind the politician. And most of the art showed her as a politician, not as a woman, which is what I wanted to do. You had to respect her drive and determination.

‘I was a young adult when she came to power, so I remember what the country was like before,’ she says. ‘She was a force for good at the time. Opinion is always going to be divided. But her legacy was so great and she achieved so much from humble origins.’

As for the statue, the sculptor has yet to be decided.

Helen Goral jokes that although the material is most likely to be bronze, ‘iron has been suggested!’

In the meantime, Margaret Thatcher will be remembered in the condolence book, signed in the Grantham Museum after her death.

One entry pays tribute from someone who says they are for ever in her debt, having benefited from Thatcher’s flagship policy of selling people their council house. It adds: ‘People must not forget the three-day week and sitting at home in candlelight because the coal miners were on strike. RIP.’

Another simply says: ‘You will always be remembered in Grantham for all you did for the country — and you were a Grantham girl.’
