A 15-year-old girl whose burned body was discovered in Indianapolis over the weekend was likely abducted, strangled to death and then set on fire by a 'random' attacker, say police.

Dominique Allen was last seen sitting on her sister's porch at 4.30am on Sunday. Her burned body was discovered at 12.30pm the same day in the yard of a home three-minutes drive away.

Yesterday police discovered her purse and shoes in the back yard of an abandoned home across the street from where her body was found, and officers now believe she was taken there and killed, before the corpse was moved.

A coroner has also revealed that Allen was likely strangled to death before being set alight, after an autopsy revealed there was no smoke in her lungs.

One of Allen's sisters, Shenika Poindexter, issued a stern warning to whoever was responsible during a news conference Tuesday at the site where the body was found.

A small makeshift wooden cross was placed next to scorch marks in the grass, and decorated with flowers and stuffed animals.

She said: 'I don't know why you had to do this. Whatever you do, wherever you go, justice is going to be served, in this life or the next. 

'I don't care, they will hunt you until you die. ... She did not deserve this, she did not deserve this, she was 15 years old.'

Poindexter added that her sister wasn't the type to talk to strangers or get in a car with someone she didn't know. The victim had been staying with another sister, Mareeka Allen, before she vanished.

Mareeka Allen said the crime was a 'careless random act,' and a detective investigating the case agreed.

'At this time, we believe it was random,' Indianapolis Metro Police Detective Marcus Kennedy said.

Investigators are combing registered sex offenders for possible leads and checking for reported runaways in case there are other victims. 

Allen was last seen at 4.30am on Sunday  before going missing. Her burned body was found at 12.30pm the same day (pictured, Allen's family mourn her death at the scorched spot where she was discovered)

Kennedy distributed a photograph of Dominique Allen taken the last night she was alive. In it, she's smiling and wearing the sandals that were discovered Tuesday.

Her sisters said Allen, who attended Ben Davis Ninth Grade Center, wanted to be a model and to attend Spelman College in Atlanta.

Deputy Mayor Olgen Williams, who lives a few blocks away from where the girl's body was found, comforted the family at the news conference.

'Pretty young lady, she had a future, and this evil person, or persons, destroyed her life,' Williams said in an interview afterward.

Allen was last seen on Sunday sitting outside her sister's house after getting into an argument with friends and going outside to cool off.

Police then believe a car was used to take her to an abandoned house a block away where she was killed. Officers do not know how many people were involved. 

Wayne Township school officials brought in counselors at the girl's school to help students and staff cope with Allen's death.
