North Korea has announced it will restart all facilities at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex, just hours after the U.S. stepped up the military stand-off by sending destroyer capable of shooting down ballistic missiles to the Korean Peninsula.

The USS McCain, named after the father and grandfather of Senator John McCain, was dispatched Monday from its port in Japan and ordered to sail for Korea.

The 505-foot guided-missile destroyer carries the U.S. Navy's advanced Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, a sophisticated radar system designed to target enemy missiles and launch precision rockets to intercept and destroy them.

The Navy also shifted the SBX-1, a $900million floating radar platform that has even more powerful equipment for tracking missiles.

South Korean officials, meanwhile, responded to threats from the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un by saying that any attack would receive a 'strong response.'

The two pieces of Navy hardware join an unknown number of F-22 stealth fighter jets that the US Air Force sent to South Korea as both a show of force against the North and a pledge of support for its allies in Seoul.

The Air Force has previously flown B-2 Spirit and B-52 Stratofortress bombers over the Korean peninsula with the same aim.

North Korea today announced that it would kick-start its nuclear programme once again by re-opening a complex which was closed as part of disarmament talks six years ago. A file handout satellite image shows the Yongbyon complex nuclear facility

North Korea will rebuild and restart 
nuclear facilities including a mothballed uranium enrichment facility 
and a 5 MW reactor, both in Yongbyon, KCNA quoted a spokesman at its 
atomic energy agency as saying.

Pyongyang is estimated to have enough fissile material to build up to eight nuclear bombs, although estimates vary.

According to estimates from the 
Institute for Science and International Security from late 2012, North 
could have enough weapons grade uranium for 21-32 nuclear weapons by 
2016 if it used one centrifuge at its Yongbyon nuclear plant to enrich 
uranium to weapons-grade.

'The General Department of Atomic 
Energy...decided to adjust and alter the uses of the existing nuclear 
facilities, to begin with,' KCNA reported.

It said the nuclear facilities would be used for both electricity and military uses.

It was not clear how long it would 
take to restart the reactor, whose cooling tower was blown up in a 
made-for-TV event in 2008 under an agreement to suspend the atomic 
complex.

North Korea, led by Kim Jong-un, has stepped up its fighting talk with a series of warnings and threats in recent weeks

There have been reports of 
construction work near where the tower once stood but it was not clear 
whether the North was rebuilding it.

On Saturday, North Korea said it was 
entering a 'state of war' with South Korea but the statement was played 
down by Seoul and the US as the latest piece of 'tough talk' from 
Pyongyang.

Today the U.N. chief says he fears North Korea is on a collision course with other nations that could lead to war.

U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says the isolated Asian nation appears to
be 'on a collision course with the international community' amid rising
tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

Ban,
a former South Korean foreign minister, said Tuesday in Andorra 'the 
current crisis has already gone too far' because of escalating tensions 
raised by North Korea's threats of war almost daily against the United 
States and South Korea.

He said international negotiations are urgently needed but he is 'convinced that no one intends to attack' North Korea.

Pyongyang
has sought disarmament-for-aid talks with Washington and more domestic 
loyalty by portraying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a powerful 
commander.

Tensions 
have been high on the Korean peninsula since Kim ordered its third 
nuclear weapons test in February, breaching United Nations sanctions and
ignoring warnings from China, its closest ally, not to do so.

The test drew further UN and bilateral 
sanctions designed to pressure North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons 
program. Instead, Pyongyang has responded with a campaign of threats, 
including a vow to launch nuclear weapons at the United States, and a 
series of warnings.

Over the weekend, the North's top decision-making body said nuclear weapons are 'treasure' and the
'nation's life' and will not be traded for billions of dollars, the 
latest in a series of provocative statements from the rogue state.

'[North Korea] will achieve nothing by 
threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and
undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in 
north-east Asia,' the US said in a statement.

Sabre-rattling on the Korean peninsula also
drew a plea for peace from Pope Francis, who in his first Easter Sunday
address called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

'Peace in Asia, above all on the 
Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a renewed spirit of 
reconciliation grow,' he said.

After the North's young leader Kim Jong-un chaired his first plenary meeting of the ruling Worker's Party central committee yesterday, a statement to the official KCNA news agency said the country's nuclear weapons 'are neither a political
bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings to be presented to 
the place of dialogue or be put on the table of negotiations aimed at 
forcing [Pyongyang] to disarm itself'.

An unknown number of radar-evading F-22 Raptors were deployed to Osan Air Base, the main US Air Force base in South Korea, from Japan to take part in the annual joint Foal Eagle military drills, which prepare the allies to defend the South from a North Korean attack.

On Thursday, the United States performed a rare show of force aimed at the North by dropping dummy munitions from two B-2 Spirit stealth bombers on practice runs over South Korea, which led to Kim putting the North's missile units on standby to attack American military bases in the South and the Pacific.

The two Koreas have been in a state of war since the truce that ended their 1950-53 conflict.

Despite the threats from the North, few believe Pyongyang will risk near-certain defeat by restarting a full-scale war.

On Saturday, North Korea declared it was entering a 'state of war' with the South

Analysts say the threats are more likely to be efforts 
to provoke softer policies toward Pyongyang from a new government in 
Seoul, to win diplomatic talks with Washington that could get more aid for the North 
and to strengthen the young North Korean leader's image and 
military credentials at home.

Japan's top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga condemned North Korea for 'aggressive provocation' after Kim's ruling party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, identified US military bases in Japan as targets for attack.

Pyongyang justifies its own nuclear pursuits largely on a perceived threat from the US.

The White House says the United States 
is taking North Korea's threats seriously, but has also noted 
Pyongyang's history of 'bellicose rhetoric'.
