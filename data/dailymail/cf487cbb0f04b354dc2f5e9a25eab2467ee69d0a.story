Amy Winehouse has turned down payment for her shambolic concert in Belgrade, Serbia.

The troubled singer was originally thought to be demanding full payment as, despite giving one of the worst shows of her career, she had fulfilled her contract by arriving on time and staying on stage for 70 minutes.

Amy - who seemed dazed and lost as she stumbled around the stage - was booed off by angry fans after delivering barely recognisable versions of her hits.

A let down: Amy Winehouse looked inebriated as she arrived on stage an hour late in Serbia, staggered about, slurred her words and was jeered by the audience

The furious concert organisers said today that they expected they would have to pay the singer in full because she kept to 
the letter of her contract with them.

'She did it all according to the agreement. She arrived in Belgrade on time and stayed on stage for 70 minutes, so we can't do anything,' a spokesman for the promoters told local media.

But a spokesperson for Winehouse told the Mail Online that she will not seek payment for the performance after all.

The rep said that upcoming festival dates in Istanbul on Monday and 
in Athens on Wednesday would be cancelled following the Belgrade show. Her next show is scheduled for
July 8 in Spain.

Where am I? Amy looked lost and confused as she swayed in front of the microphone

The Back to Black star's management had 
banned alcohol from every room on the floor of the Hyatt hotel she was 
using in Belgrade in a desperate bid to keep her on the straight and 
narrow.

But her Saturday night performance was so dire that even the Serbian government has attacked her.

Defence minister Dragan Sutanovac said on his Facebook page: 'Amy's concert was a shame and a huge disappointment.

'She is far from being a queen. She's
more like a patient of a rehabilitation clinic for drugs and an alcohol
addict. She needs serious medical assistance.'

Concert organisers meanwhile are 
trying to find where the singer obtained whatever it was that had made 
her seem intoxicated - warning that they might seek compensation if it 
turned out to be the hotel or someone related to the event that had 
agreed to keep alcohol away from the star.

What is she doing? To the amusement of her band, Amy bends over on stage to take off one of her shoes

Hello: Amy holds on to her guitarist who she went over and hugged as after being introduced onto the stage at Belgrade's Kalemegdan Park

A statement released earlier by Winehouse's management read: 'Despite feeling sure that she wanted to fulfill these commitments, she 
has agreed with management that she cannot perform to the best of her 
ability and will return home.

'She would like to 
apologize to fans expecting to see her at the shows but feels that this 
is the right thing to do.'

An
hour after she was due to arrive on stage in Belgrade, after being 
introduced by one of her backing singers, she staggered on and made her 
way to the back to hug one of her guitarists.

Wearing a short green and black dress
that accentuated her cosmetically-enhanced breasts, she sat down on one
of the speakers and adjusted her shoes while her concerned backing 
singer asked if she was ok and steadied her back to her microphone.

Are you ok? As she stumbled around looking lost, her backing singer grabbed her hand in concern

Amy,
27, looked confused and then took off one of her shoes which she threw 
on the floor before walking unsteadily over to her microphone.

After missing her cue a couple of 
times, she proceeded to deliver a half-spoken and mumbled version of her
song Just Friends, her last release back in 2008.

Halfway
through, slurring her words which she had difficulty stringing 
together, she told the crowd at the city's Kalemegdan Park: 'Let me 
bring the band introduction.'

But
then she tried to continue singing the song, smiling all the while, 
seemingly oblivious of how she was coming across to her fans.

Trying her best: At some points during the concert, Amy looked lucid and happy as she sang some of her biggest hits

After hugging herself and failing to 
sing most of the song, she then came back in as the band finished, 
looked surprised and then slurred 'Just Friends' into the microphone as 
an astonished crowd booed and halfheartedly clapped.

The
situation didn't improve much throughout the concert, as the Back to 
Black singer disappeared off stage several times leaving her band 
playing.

And according to local press reports, the 20,000 fans described as a 'scandal' and a 'disaster'.

Voluptuous: Amy's short green and black dress accentuated her cosmetically-enhanced breasts

Fans were also angry as may had paid about £35 a ticket which is a lot of money in a country where the average salary is about £274 a month.

One fan angrily wrote on YouTube - where videos of her disastrous performance have been posted - that he was still mad at her.

They fumed: 'She
started a show and turned her back to public (btw, for most of us it 
was not that easy to give the money for ticket because of the economic 
situation in Serbia) and that was just the beginning of her disrespect 
and bizarre behavior.

Unsteady: Amy hugged herself a lot throughout the gig as she swayed about

'She did not sang one song from beginning to the end, Some of them she didn't even tried to sing. Not a fan anymore'

Amy is due in Turkey tomorrow to play Istanbul's Kucuk Ciftlik Park and also has dates in Greece, 
Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Poland, Hungary and Romania, finishing up on 
15 August at Iolanda Balas Soter Stadium, Bucharest.

Earlier this month she checked out of The Priory Clinic at the suggestion
of her father, Mitch, over concerns she was drinking too much prior to 
her live shows.

Outrage: Fans, who had paid a lot of money to see her play, turned on the star afterwards and called the show a 'disaster'

Her spokesman said: 'Amy Winehouse has completed 
her assessment at the Priory Clinic in London and will continue as an 
outpatient.

'She is now looking forward to playing shows around Europe this summer and is raring to go.

'She would like to send a huge thanks to all her fans for the messages 
of support she has received over the last week and can't wait to see 
them.'
