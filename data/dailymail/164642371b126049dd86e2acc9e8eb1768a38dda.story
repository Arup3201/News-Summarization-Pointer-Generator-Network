Beyonce this week hit headlines when it was revealed she owned a pair of bespoke trainers made of five different exotic animal skins including anaconda, stingray and crocodile. Fans and animal welfare groups slammed the singer as 'cruel' and 'spoilt'.

Now her husband, U.S. rapper Jay-Z, has been dragged into the controversy as it is revealed he has a pair of trainers made for him out of elephant skin.

The shoes, which were custom-made last year by high fashion brand Perfectly Made Kicks (PMK), the same brand behind Beyonce's trainers, use the elephant hide among nine other types of skin - almost all from exotic animals.

The Brooklyn Zoo Jordan 1 not only 
has the five skins used in Beyonce’s Key Beys - stingray, anaconda, 
ostrich, crocodile and calf - but adds to that morbid roll call with 
alligator, boa, python, and lizard.

And, of course, most shocking of all, elephant skin.

The sneakers, which use the heavily 
grained hide in the side panels, are a customised version of the Nike Air Jordan and cost $2,500 (around £1,664) a pair.

Jay-Z, who has been photographed wearing the shoes on many occasions, is obviously very proud of his exotic acquisition.

When he received them he posted a picture on his blog Life And
 Times of one of the shoes on a podium in his house accompanied by the caption, 'Condos in my condo'.

It must be stated that while the idea of trading elephant skin seems alien and shocking to many of us, the use of sanctioned elephant hide in the manufacture of leather goods is not illegal.

Elephant skin is used in everything from
 boots, belts and shoes to gun holders and pool cues, and many items can
 be bought easily on eBay and elsewhere online.

It is legal to buy and sell the hides under certain conditions laid out in the Convention Of International Treaty Of Endangered Species (CITES).

Ingrid Newkirk, founder of animal rights charity PETA says: 'There can be no shame or sense of decency left in the world, that a few people, can show so much disrespect for life as to order up the slaughter of the largest, most revered of animals only to make them into a pair of shoes.’

Elephants fall under Appendix II of 
the CITES convention, which means they are considered 'not necessarily 
now threatened with extinction but may become so unless trade is closely
 controlled'.

The elephant leather market, mostly based in the U.S. and importing from Africa, trades freely over the internet.

The ears and trunk, being a thinner and softer leather, are highly prized and often used for wallets.

Eight square feet of elephant skin is 
usually sold at around $400 (around £266), although regular deals often 
mean it can be purchased online for less.

Although one would be hard pressed to find
 a seller of elephant in the UK, in other countries it is a highly 
valued skin that traders say is incredibly durable and has a 'rich texture'.

Roje Exotics American Leathers is just one of the multiple websites where elephant leather can be purchased

Roje Exotic American Leathers is just one of numerous companies that offers elephant skin to purchase online.

The leather can be purchased in a variety of colours from honey through to vintage peat, as well as original grey.

Roje explain on their website 
that their elephant hide, which comes from African elephants, is obtained 
only under the ‘strict requirements of the Convention of International 
Treaty of Endangered Species (CITES) permit’

They
 justify the use of the beautiful beast’s skin by saying: ‘The source of
 all African elephant skins come from culls once the elephant heard 
reaches destructive numbers to African tribes and nature.

‘It’s very similar to our deer season in the United States.

An average 8 square foot piece of elephant leather can be brought for about $400, but there are often deals like these on the Roje Exotic American Leathers website

A variety of colours and finishes are available for elephant skin, as can be seen on the Roje Exotic American Leathers website

‘Without culling, which outsiders often view as unethical, many African tribes would lose their homes and possibly be trampled to death.

‘Designers, manufactures, and leather enthusiasts should not feel emotional or have guilt for using this leather as we are not creating a demand rather using a by product. We deal with reputable international partners who abide by all regulations and we never sell poached hides.’

But the truth remains that many of us feel a strong emotional attachment to these majestic beasts.

Elephants are not only a highly 
endangered species, but fiercely intelligent, remaining in tight-knit 
family groups throughout their life and many are repulsed by the use of elephant skin under any circumstances.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, PETA’s Founder Ingrid Newkirk said: ‘There can be no shame or sense of decency left in the world that a few people, so out of touch with the wonder of nature, can show so much disrespect for life as to order up the slaughter of the smallest, most vulnerable and the largest, most revered of animals only to make them into a pair of shoes.’

When contacted over the issue, the CEO of PMK, Andre Scott, responded: 'No elephants were beaten, harmed, or killed in the development and crafting of the Brooklyn Zoo sneaker.

'All leather and exotic skins including elephant skin found in the 'Brooklyn Zoo' used by PMK are from a legal supplier in New York.'
