Police have arrested a man on suspicion of murder after Alex Peguero-Sosa, 17, died following a fight at a taxi rank

Police have arrested a man on suspicion of murder after a teenager died in the early hours of this morning following a fight at a taxi rank.

Alex Peguero-Sosa, 17, a former youth team player for Plymouth Argyle, is believed to have died from head wounds after a fight broke out in Kingsbridge, south Devon.

Police and ambulance crews were called to the taxi rank at 2.20am this morning after reports that a teenager had been injured in a fight.

On arrival they found the teenager, who was a student at the local Kingsbridge Community College, had sustained serious injuries.

Members of the public tried to help him and began heart massage with CPR before paramedics arrived to take over.

He was rushed 17 miles to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital where he was declared dead.

A 42-year-old local man was found by police in nearby Fore Street seven hours later and arrested on suspicion of murder.

He was taken to Torquay police station where he will be questioned. Detectives are investigating the murder and are seeking witnesses to the incident.

Det Insp Ian Ringrose said: 'We believe there were a lot of people in the area at the time of this incident. I would ask anyone who witnessed the incident, or the events before and after, to contact the police.

'The police are working closely with the victim's family to provide support at this difficult time.

'The community is understandably in shock and coming to terms with this incident which is very rare in Kingsbridge.

'We are working with the college to support students and staff and local officers will be at the school in the next few days to provide reassurance and assistance at this very sad time.'

The area was cordoned off earlier today while forensic teams investigated the scene. Floral tributes were also left nearby.
