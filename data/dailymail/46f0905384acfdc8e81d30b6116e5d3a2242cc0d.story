Employees at the Ohio prison where convicted school shooter T.J. Lane staged a jail break on Thursday said that the day before they had segregated an inmate and warned officials about an escape plot.

Christopher Mabe, the president of the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, told CNN that staff filed documentation on Wednesday about the escape plan, there was no 'follow up from prison officials'. 

He said the inmate who had been segregated was not Lane but didn't know if it was one of the two others who hopped a fence to escape from the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio.

Caught: T.J. Lane smirks as he listens to the judge during his sentencing in Chardon, Ohio. Lane and two others escaped from the prison where he was being held, and all were recaptured a day later

Clifford E. Opperud, 45, who was serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, burglary, and kidnapping, escaped with Lane

The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said it is looking into the report.

Lane, the 19-year-old who killed three students at a high school cafeteria east of Cleveland in February 2012, and the other escapees are now all back in custody. Lane was found outside a church 100 yards from the prison shortly after 1am on Friday.  

All three escapees are now back in custody. Lane was captured outside a church 100 yards away from the prison shortly after 1 a.m. Friday with the help of police aircraft hiding out near a farm building in the area.

Now that the manhunt for the prisoners is over officials and others are asking how they managed to escape. In particular, some wonder why Lane wasn't held in the maximum-security part of the prison. He was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for the shooting at Chardon High School, and has never shown the slightest remorse. 

'That is something we have to sit down and take a look at,' Warden Kevin Jones said, according to CNN. 

Lane pleaded guilty last year to the shooting, and said he didn't know why did it.

Before his case went to adult court in 2012, a juvenile judge ruled that Lane was mentally competent to stand trial despite evidence he suffers from hallucinations, psychosis and fantasies. At his sentencing, Lane was defiant, smiling and smirking throughout, including while four relatives of the victims spoke.

In addition to at least three other offenses for which Lane has been punished in recent months, the cold-blooded teen killer has been found guilty of the following disorderliness:

August 2014: Lane was cited for urinating on an Allen Correctional Institution prison wall

October 2013: Lane disobeyed a prison work order and lost 10 days recreation time

August 2013: Lane refused to follow through with a work assignment and was verbally reprimanded

July 2013: Lane was separated from the general population for 10 days as punishment for giving himself a tattoo

Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr, 17, who were killed in the rampage. Three others were injured.

Prison officials said they still didn't know how the men escaped. 

A recent state report on the prison revealed that it's over capacity and has recently suffered from increased violence.

An April visit from a state committee found that the 20-year-old facility housed 1,635 prisoners, 217, or 15 per cent, above its capacity, according to the Plains Dealer.

The report all addressed problems in the maximum security areas of the prison and noted that the number of inmate assaults on staff jumped 60 per cent in 2013 compared with the previous year. .  

'Security management remains a concern, both in terms of how the higher security inmates are handled, as well as discipline for misconduct,' the report states.

The frightening words of TJ Lane's attorney: Ian Friedman tweeted his take on his old client's escape on Thursday night, and it left many with a sense of unease

Ohio public safety and correction officials said they led an 'extensive search' for the escaped inmates and had help from local authorities and the Ohio State Highway Patrol. .

Reached on Thursday at her home in Chardon, Dina Parmertor, mother of Daniel Parmertor, said of Lane's escape: 'I'm disgusted that it happened. I'm extremely scared and panic stricken. I can't believe it.' 

Proud murderer: T.J. Lane unbuttons his shirt during sentencing to reveal the word 'killer' emblazoned on his inside shirt

Chardon Police told CNN they offered to provide extra patrols to the families of Lane's victims and to people in the area who asked for it.

Attorney Ian Friedman, who defended Lane in the Chardon High case expressed shock when the Cleveland Plain Dealer informed him of his former client's escape.

'It's wild,' Friedman said. 'I'm sure there will be a lot of questions asked about how the correctional facility could allow this to happen.'

Friedman also warned that while dangerous in many ways, Lane also wields the weapon of intellect.

'I can't speak to what his mindset is,' Friedman said. 'But I don't think anyone would dispute the fact that he's a very smart young man.'

Lane fired 10 shots at students in a cafeteria at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. He was there waiting for a bus to another school.

Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed.

Lane, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, was prosecuted as an adult. Minutes before his guilty plea, the judge accepted a report finding Lane mentally competent to stand trial.

Investigators say he admitted shooting at students but said he didn't know why he did it. Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school on Feb. 27, 2012, and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria.

Lane attended an alternative school for students who haven't done well in traditional schools. He was at Chardon waiting for a bus.

Wearing a T-shirt with 'killer' scrawled across it, a teenager cursed and gestured obscenely as he was given three life sentences Tuesday for shooting to death three students in an Ohio high school cafeteria.

T.J. Lane, 18, had pleaded guilty  to shooting at students in February 2012 at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. Investigators have said he admitted to the shooting but said he didn't know why he did it.

Before the case went to adult court, a juvenile court judge ruled that Lane was mentally competent to stand trial despite evidence he suffers from hallucinations, psychosis and fantasies.

Lane was defiant during the sentencing, smiling and smirking throughout, including while four relatives of victims spoke.

After he came in, he calmly unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal the T-shirt reading 'killer,' which the prosecutor noted was similar to one he wore during the shooting.

At one point, he swiveled around in his chair toward the gallery where his own family members and those of the slain teenagers were sitting and spoke suddenly, surprising even his lawyer.

'The hand that pulls the trigger that killed your sons now masturbates to the memory,' he said, then cursed at and raised his middle finger toward the victims' relatives.

A student who was wounded in the rampage dismissed the outburst.

'He said it like a scared little boy and couldn't talk slow enough that anyone could understand him,' said Nate Mueller, who was nicked in the ear in the shooting.

The forgotten school shooting: An Ohio State highway patrol helicopter prepares to leave the grounds of Chardon High School in February 2012 after Lane opened fire with a handgun in the cafeteria of an Ohio high school east of Cleveland on Monday, fatally wounding three students

Dina Parmertor, mother of victim Daniel, called Lane 'a pathetic excuse for a human being' and wished upon him 'an extremely, slow torturous death.' She said she has nightmares and her family has been physically sick over the crimes.

'From now on, he will only be a killer,' she said, as Lane's smile widened. 'I want him to feel my anger toward him.'

Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed.

Lane was at Chardon waiting for a bus to the alternative school he attended, for students who haven't done well in traditional settings.

Lane had pleaded guilty last month to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of felonious assault.

Life imprisonment without parole was the maximum sentence Lane faced. He wasn't eligible for the death penalty because he was 17 at the time of the shootings. Relatives of the slain students indicated earlier they wanted Lane to get the maximum sentence.

Employees at the Ohio prison told their bosses they had to segregate an inmate and warned of chatter of an escape plan, according to their union boss

But there was no 'follow up' from prison officials, he said

The three escapees were quickly captured, but their successful jailbreak has raised concerns about security at the prison and why the remorseless Lane wasn't held in the maximum security wing
