A father's worst nightmare came true when a homeless man admitted to having sex with a 15-year-old girl whose family he knew.

Brent Jacob Surdyke, 28, of St. Charles, Missouri, was charged with statutory rape and statutory sodomy on Thursday.

The relationship between Surdyke and his unnamed victim was discovered by the girl's father, who found text messages between the two on his daughter’s cell phone.
