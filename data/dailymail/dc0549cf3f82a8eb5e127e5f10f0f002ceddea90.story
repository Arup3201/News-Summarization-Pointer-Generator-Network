Mohamed Salah cut a forlorn figure at Chelsea, regularly benched and never able to put together a good run of form.  

So it came as no surprise when the Egyptian winger was shipped off on loan to Fiorentina as makeweight for the £27 million deal that saw Juan Cuadrado sign for the Blues.

Now though, Salah has found a new lease of life at La Viola, and was pictured beaming with delight after scoring his side's second goal in their 2-0 Europa League win over Tottenham, alongside another Premier League outcast, Micah Richards.

Richards, who saw his own first-team opportunities limited at Manchester City, is another player Fiorentina have signed for the season on loan. 

The pair are now both proving their worth in La Viola's Europa League and Serie A campaigns.   

Fiorentina's 2-0 triumph over Spurs concluded a 3-1 aggregate scoreline and sees Vincenzo Montella's men reach the competition's last 16. 

Meanwhile, Fiorentina are currently fifth in the league table with 39 points, six behind third-placed Napoli, who occupy Italy's third and final Champions League qualifying spot; and will look to close that gap starting with their trip to Inter Milan on Sunday.
