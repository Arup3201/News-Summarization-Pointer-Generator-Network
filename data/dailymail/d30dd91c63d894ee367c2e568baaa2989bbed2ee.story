Two of them arrived on identical bicycles, sporting identical helmets and matching rucksacks.

Another pair stayed so close they barely strayed apart by more than a couple of paces.

And some of them have had a spooky idea about what the other was about to say, before she even said it.

Today, some of these intriguing links were finally explored at a record-breaking gathering of twins taking part in the world’s biggest medical study.

Around 750 individuals (that’s 375 pairs in anyone else’s language) assembled to celebrate 21 years of research by the Department of Twin Research at King’s College, London, based at St Thomas’ Hospital.

More than 12,000 twins aged between 16 and 101 are registered for the study, which has helped experts to catalogue a series of findings that range from the mildly fascinating, such as twins drink an average 24 cups of tea a week and like Marmite, to potentially ground-breaking discoveries.

They include scientists discovering more than 400 novel genes associated with over 30 diseases since the study began in 1992, enabling researchers to investigate genetic and environmental causes of traits and illnesses including cancer, short-sightedness, osteoporosis, pain, diabetes and obesity.

Today's birthday event saw 750 taking part in scientific experiments for research into areas such as pain, hearing loss and skin-ageing - as well as undergoing a telepathy study.

Participating twins were separated; one was subjected to minor electric shocks or sudden loud noises while the other was asked if they experienced the same reactions.

TwinsUK director Professor Tim Spector said other tests included sitting twins opposite each other and asking them to guess which cards the other is holding.

Prof Spector, who is sceptical about claims of telepathic communication between twins, said: ‘Last time we did this, the only clear result was that those wearing reflective sunglasses cheated.’
