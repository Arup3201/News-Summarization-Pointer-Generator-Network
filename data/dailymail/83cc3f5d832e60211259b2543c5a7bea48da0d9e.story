There is a dimension to the harnessing of Glenn Hoddle to Harry Redknapp which stretches far beyond Queens Park Rangers, higher even than the utmost reaches of the Premier League to which this middling club merrily aspires.

Here is the next England management team in waiting.

If the wheels on Roy Hodgson’s bandwagon fall off a second time, come in ‘Arry Boy and Godly Glenn.

Perfect partnership: Harry Redknapp has appointed Glenn Hoddle to his staff at Queens Park Rangers 

Tricky period: Roy Hodgson needs to hit the ground running to stave off any talk over his future as boss 

Redknapp was the people’s alternative the last time the FA went fishing for a national team boss. Hoddle might still have been in the job had he not given public airing to his unorthodox religious opinions.

The FA plumped for the coaching intelligence which has always been Hodgson’s stock in trade and has been enriched by a wealth of experience abroad.

That was preferred to the quick-witted, inspirational man-management style of Redknapp.

Hoddle, however, is a thoughtful tactician and if he and Redknapp hit it off in Shepherd’s Bush the temptation will arise, sooner or later, for England to see in that partnership the best of both worlds.

The bad cop and the God cop, the tongue-lasher and the quiet talker, the backside-kicker and the gentle persuader.

More and more in the world of football it takes two to tango and this pair are each other’s alter-egos.

Most importantly, Redknapp and Hoddle each bring something to the party which is different from the other.

Dismal: England were eliminated from the World Cup in Brazil this summer after just two group games 

New era: The Three Lions needs leadership after the international retirement of captain Steven Gerrard 

Redknapp has no problem admitting as much. He is talking openly about Hoddle revolutionising the tactics of a QPR team which his own street-wise instincts dragged to the Premier League by its bootlaces last season.

Where Redknapp was born and bred to 4-4-2, Hoddle was an early convert to the 3-5-2 system which has been finding favour in the foreign leagues for some years, becoming more prevalent during this Brazilian World Cup summer and is preferred by new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.

Hoddle flirted with that conversion during his spell as England manager which was brought to an abrupt end after he made known his apparent belief that the disabled are being punished from on high for misbehaviour in previous lives.

No amount of dissembling could get him off that hook but he has found out for himself now that time not only heals but makes men wiser.

Wrong decisions: While manager of England, Hoddle handled Paul Gascoigne poorly 

Redknapp, by contrast, would have handled the maverick Paul Gascoigne more cleverly. Hoddle, in the heat of an unseemly ruckus, expelled Gazza from England’s World Cup squad for France 98, not realising how sensible it would have been to keep that genius on hand in case the day came when he was needed.

Inevitably it did, as Redknapp would have known. Just as he can see the attraction in a pairing of opposites with Hoddle.

Hodgson, having survived after World Cup 2014 elimination inside two matches, has the acumen to turn his and England’s fortunes around for Euro 2016, for which the qualifying fixtures are about to commence.

But there are no certainties at international level and, by a neat twist of the draw, that campaign opens with an away match against the Swiss, who he turned into awkward tournament rivals during a spell as their national manager.

Talking tactics: QPR are set to change their formation under the guidance of Hoddle this season 

The FA are pleading patience for a decent man and that is not unreasonable. But unless England’s results improve in the immediate post-Steven Gerrard era, Hodgson knows how fierce the public backlash will be.

Whenever that clamour becomes irresistible the most difficult question to answer is always who should get the job next.

By the time England’s fate in the Euros unfolds, Redknapp and Hoddle could well be the most popular answer.

This Wednesday has marked the tenth anniversary of the opening ceremony for the Athens Olympics.

The days and weeks prior to this landmark have been notable for damning photographs and reports of the state of neglect into which the venues have fallen.

Many have also sought to blame the cost of the Games for Greece’s dire economic crisis. 

Dossier: Gianna Angelopoulos - the Lord Coe of Athens 2004 – has commissioned a study into the real costs

Now the remarkable woman who drove through the completion of construction and a of myriad other preparations in time to deliver a highly acclaimed Games – to the chagrin of all the doomsayers who predicted Athens would never be ready – is fighting back.

Gianna Angelopoulos – the first lady of Olympia and as such the Lord Coe of Athens – has commissioned a forensic study into the real costs as well as the full extent of the benefits to the city.

Her critics should beware. Angelopoulos, who almost killed herself working 20 hours a day to get Athens built in less days than seemed humanly possible when she took over a failing operation, is a formidable foe.

She also has influential friends. President Bill Clinton is just one global powerbroker who has endorsed her new book - about the struggle to save the 2004 Games - as inspirational.

Angelopoulos has instructed the highly respected Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research ‘to conduct a detailed and scientific investigation into the overall impact of the Games’.

While there can be no disputing the dramatic pictorial evidence of venues such as the Olympic pool, the rowing centre, the stadium itself and the canoeing facility being in sorry disrepair, Angelopoulos denies that is the full story.

Where's the legacy? Reports of the state of neglect into which the venues have fallen have been damning

That, she and her allies insist, is to be found in the transformation of Athens into a modern European capital by the Games.

Against every rundown venue she can cite the bustling shopping mall which used to be the International Broadcast Centre, the badminton hall which is now a regularly-packed theatre and a majority of other sites which have been sold off.

When it comes down to the hard cash, Angelopoulos is confident that a significant percentage of the reported £6.8billion spent on the Olympics and Paralympics will be found to have been invested in roads, tramways, hospitals, hotels and the long overdue restoration of fabled archaeological sites.

No backing down now: Angelopoulos is insistent that the Games were a success and helped Greece 

Even by the most extravagant estimates the Games cannot be held accountable for more than one per cent of the Greek national debt. In return for that, this ancient capital has been rejuvenated as a contemporary showcase for its historic past.

Legacy is the Olympic buzz-word but in the narrow terms of the stadia it is arguable that Athens is no worse off than Sydney, while the infrastructure of that city hardly benefited.

And whither London, it is being asked, eight years from now?

The Athens study is due for publication ‘before the end of this year.’

Then, let the fun and games begin.
