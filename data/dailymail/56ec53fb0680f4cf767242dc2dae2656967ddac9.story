Murdered: A congressman has called for an FBI probe into the death of mayoral candidate Marco McMillian (pictured) in Mississippi

A Mississippi congressman has called for an FBI probe into the killing of an openly gay mayoral candidate.

US Rep Bennie Thompson - whose district includes Clarksdale, where Marco McMillian was running - wants the review to determine if any federal laws might have been broken.

The body of Mr McMillian, 34, was found last week in a rural area nearby. His body was reportedly beaten and burned before being left near a Mississippi River levee.

Mr Thompson, a Democrat, said he has confidence in the sheriff investigating the death but that he wants the FBI to get involved because that's what Mr McMillian's family wants, ABC News reports.

'If another set of eyes looking at it would provide additional information, I think it would be helpful to the McMillian family,' Mr Thompson said.

Coahoma County sheriff's spokesman Will Rooker said the investigation continues and that officers are looking at all possibilities - including whether hate crime laws were broken, according to ABC News.

Mr Thompson, who is the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the FBI could determine if a hate crimes charge should be considered.

Mr McMillian's campaign had said he was one of the first openly gay, viable candidates for public office in Mississippi. Mr Thompson said he had personally known
Mr McMillian and that his daughter and the mayoral candidate had 
attended the same college - Jackson State University - at the same time.

A person with knowledge of the 
investigation told the Associated Press that Mr McMillian was found to have bruises and that 
there were burns on at least part of his body.

On Thursday, Lawrence Reed, 22, was taken into custody and charged with the murder of Mr McMillian. The cause of death has not yet been released.

The
relationship between the two men is unclear but Reed was allegedly 
driving McMillian's SUV when it was involved in a head-on crash just 
before the candidate's body was discovered.

According to the pressregister.com, Reed, an associate at the Motor Club of America, was injured in the crash and provided police with the location of McMillian's body.

Authorities 
had been looking for Mr McMillian who was reported missing after the early morning crash.

Campaign 
supporters and residents paid tribute to the politician as a dedicated 
community activist.

'We
remember Marco as a bold and passionate public servant, whose faith 
informed every aspect of his life,' his campaign manager, Jarod Keith, 
said in a statement. 'Tragically, that life has been cut short.'

Political ambitions: Marco McMillian was running as a democrat candidate for mayor of Clarksdale. Supporters said the politician, pictured right with President Obama, could have gone all the way

The 
sheriff's office said deputies responded to the two-car crash on US 
Highway 49 South near the Coahoma and Tallahatchie county lines at about 8 am.

Mr McMillian
was hoping to win the office being vacated by Mayor Henry Espy Jr., the
brother of Mike Espy, a former congressman and U.S. Agriculture 
Secretary.

Henry Espy decided not to seek re-election after more than 
two decades in office.

Fans and friends of Mr McMillian, whose 
Facebook account features a picture of him alongside President Obama, paid tribute to him last week.

Dennis Thomas, 33, who works at Abe's Barbeque, in Clarksdale said: 'There's
a lot of people upset about it. Why would somebody want to do something
like that to somebody of that caliber?

'He was a highly respected person
in town. He's been in the community helping out a lot.'

Norman Van Collins Sr took to Facebook to say the party had lost a future star.

'I am definitely praying for the family as well as sharing their grief,' he said.

'Marco was like a son to me, and I so looked forward to his campaign and 
his ultimately becoming the next mayor of my hometown Clarksdale which 
so desperately needs leadership such that of Marco. He was definitely 
POTUS potential.'

The
Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund and Institute said there 'hearts go 
out to the family and friends of Marco McMillian'.

Hopeful: Mr McMillian was running for mayor of Clarksdale after years as a dedicated community activist

Mr McMillian
was CEO of MWM & Associates, described on its website as a 
consulting firm for non-profit organizations. He had recently served as 
international executive director of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc.

Jimmy
Hammock, the fraternity's international president, praised Mr McMillian in
a Facebook post for making 'an incredible difference in his community 
and in Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity'.

A statement
from the historically black fraternity said he had secured the first 
federal contract to 'raise the awareness of the adverse impact of 
HIV/AIDS on communities of color for the Fraternity'.

It noted that 
Ebony Magazine had recognized him in 2004 as one of the nation's '30 
up-and-coming African Americans' under age 30.
