A pastor at a mega-church says health and financial woes led to his sexual relationship with a 16-year-old church member.

Jack Schaap, 54, had been pastor of the First Baptist Church of Hammond in Indiana for 11 years, but was let go in July after a deacon saw a text on his phone from the teenager, allegedly with a picture of the two of them kissing.

He pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in September to transporting a minor across state lines for sexual relations.

In a new court filing, he says he was stressed out and depressed at the time that the month-long relationship started.

Donations to his church were down and 
he said he had to lay off employees and was working up to 100 hours a 
week, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Schaap met the victim through that extra work, which included counseling students at First Baptist's schools, he said.

The court filing, which is to be 
considered with his sentencing, included 140 letters of support from 
family and church members.

'We were known for our happy marriage, and it was not a hypocrisy; it was real,' Jack Schaap’s wife, Cindy, said in a letter.

In the September plea agreement, Schaap admitted that he 
had sex with the girl, who turned 17 a week after the relationship started. He also admitted that he used a computer to persuade the girl to have sex with him 
illegally.

The relationship lasted from June 1, 2012 to July 30, 2012, during which he traveled with her from Indiana to Illinois to Michigan, 'with the intent 
that she engage in sexual activity', according to the Chicago Tribune.

The legal age of consent in the state of Indiana is 16, the lowest age allowed in any state.

Schapp's wife, Cindy, is the daughter of the late founder of the church, Rev. Jack Hyles.

Mega-churches are houses of worship with 2,000 or more members and weekly attendees. They have grown in popularity in recent years, and are mostly a phenomenon of modern times.

According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, most current mega-churches were founded after 1955 after larger churches started to become more appealing to many church-goers. Many focus on ‘seeker services,’ which often offer little deep theology and instead appeal to sceptics and non-believers.

They are also aimed at targeting younger audiences, often with the prospects of contemporary music and more casual settings than traditional churches.

The denominations involved include Baptists, Methodists, and Nondenominational, as well as some Pentecostal churches.

Jack Schapp's published books include Marriage: The Divine Intimacy and Dating 
with a Purpose: Common Sense Dating Principles for Couples, Parents, and
 Youth Workers.

The pastor has received his fair share of criticism over the years due to some of his more controversial teachings.

Last
 year, he was chastised for his views on women, believing them to be an 
inferior species and saying husbands should take charge of their wives 
and blasted Eve as being the sinner.

He
 also said it would be a 'cold day in hell before I get my theology from
 a woman', adding: 'Your soul is going to hell because of what Eve did.'

Typically, mega-churches have more 
than 2,000 members or regular attendees, with several areas to listen to
 sermons, often with one or more pastors speaking during a Sunday 
service.

Many of them feature contemporary worship styles, with live music complete with worship band, and sometimes even an orchestra pit.

Mega-churches have also received a fair amount of criticism, as some say they focus more on entertainment than on worship, and that large numbers detract the amount of time pastors can spend with the congregation.

First Baptist is housed in the old federal courthouse building in Hammond, Indiana, and contains an auditorium that seats 7,500.

More than 15,000 people attend services on the weekend.
