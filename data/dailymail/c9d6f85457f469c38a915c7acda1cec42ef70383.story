The 100-year-old mystery surrounding how four-legged animals developed the ability to breathe air has finally been solved.

Scientists claim the ability was passed down by ancient Gogonasus -  a group of fish widely regarded by scientists as the ancestors from which the first land animals evolved.

They believe Gogonasus originally developed their breathing abilities using tiny holes in the top of their heads called ‘spiracles’.

In Polypterus, a small valve opens a lid over these spiracles to allow air to be sucked in and pumped out each time the fish surfaces.

These same holes in Gogonasus were also transformed through evolution to become Eustachian tubes, which allow humans to hear.

‘Until now we’ve only had theories about the origins of breathing in the evolution of fish to land animals,’ said Flinders University palaeontologist Professor John Long.

Air-breathing fish, such as Polypterus palmas, revealed how four-legged animals developed the ability to breathe

Research into Polypterus dates back to Napoleon’s defeat by the British at Alexandria in 1801.

One of his appointed naturalists, Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, had a specimen of a strange fish with fleshy limbs caught from the Nile River.

Writing in The Conversation, Professor Long notes that this was the Polypyterus, meaning 'many fins'.

Also called the reedfish or birchir, it is widely regarded as the most primitive living member of the true bony fish.

This group includes some 30,000 living species, including many of the fishes like snapper and salmon.

Further expeditions set out in the late 1890s to find more specimens of this strange fish.

Scientists thought that understanding its life history would reveal how fishes might have evolved into land animals.

‘Some early 19th Century scientists had these wacky ideas that fish just jumped onto the land and started gasping for breath and developing limbs,’ he said.

‘But our research shows that the transformation actually started happening within the fish themselves while they were still in water.’

Breathing through the spiracle gives the fish an evolutionary advantage as they can surface to breathe while keeping their eyes under water for predators.

As part of the study, a team based at the Scripps Research Institute observed species of Polypterus for 360 hours and measured the amount of oxygen it was taking in.

Professor Long said the findings on Polypterus is the ‘smoking gun’ that points to fossils such as Gogonasus as being capable of breathing in air through their spiracles.

‘Other lobed-finned fish fossils of that age show large spiracles on top of their heads and the earliest known tetrapod fossils also have large open spiracles on their heads.

‘All this points to the ability of these fishes to take in air from their spiracles as the first type of breathing, which ultimately helped them leave the water and invade the land.’

Professor Long said once the four-legged descendants of the lobed-finned fish abandoned the water, the ability to breathe through their spiracles declined as they switched to breathing using their mouths and nostrils, as humans do today.

‘The spiracles eventually became the hearing canal in which tetrapods transmitted sound to the brain via tiny inner ear bones, and this has remained throughout the evolution of fish right through to humans,’ he said.

‘If not for the bold evolutionary experiments of these prehistoric fish breathing in air through the top of their heads, we might not have evolved such a keen sense of hearing.’
