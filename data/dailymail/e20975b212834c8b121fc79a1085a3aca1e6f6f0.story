Sampdoria and Genoa both missed opportunities to move up to third in the Serie A standings as they failed to win their final round fixtures before the winter break.

Sampdoria were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Udinese and still trail third-place Napoli on goal difference, while Genoa remain a point further behind after losing 2-1 to Serie A strugglers Torino.

Lazio could move two points ahead of Napoli and Sampdoria if they win at Inter Milan on Sunday evening.

Earlier, Chievo Verona defeated city rival Hellas Verona 1-0 in a heated derby match.

Fiorentina, meanwhile, were held to a 1-1 draw by Empoli, while Atalanta fought back from two goals down to draw 3-3 at home to Palermo.

Sampdoria went into their clash in confident mood after holding league leaders Juventus to a 1-1 draw in Turin last weekend and they duly took the lead in the 15th minute.

Udinese goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis could only get a hand to Angelo Palombo's cross and when the ball dropped to Pedro Obiang, he fired the ball into the net.

However, the match turned in four minutes as Alexander Geijo scored his first Serie A goal, in his first start for the club, to level matters shortly before Danilo was left unmarked to head Udinese in front.

Manolo Gabbiadini headed Lorenzo Di Silvestri's cross into the top right corner on the hour mark in what could have been his last match for Sampdoria before a likely January move to Napoli.

Geijo almost scored a late winner but his header thumped the post.

Udinese were reduced to 10 men two minutes from time when Thomas Heurtaux was sent off following a second yellow card.

Genoa started the day level with Sampdoria and Lazio on 26 points, and last weekend's defeat to Roma was their first league loss in more than two months.

Fiorentina failed to capitalize on the other weekend's results it as they remain in eighth place, three points behind Napoli, after an entertaining Tuscan derby.

Juan Manuel Vargas had given Fiorentina the lead with a fierce strike after Empoli failed to clear a corner but Lorenzo Tonelli escaped his marker to nod in a Mirko Valdifiori corner from six yards.

Chievo snatched victory in the other derby of the day but replays showed Alberto Paloschi was offside as he headed in Ervin Zukanovic's superb cross into the box with nine minutes remaining.

Both sides also had penalty claims turned down.

Nene had gone closest for Verona when he headed a corner just over the crossbar, while Chievo's Ivan Radovanovic almost scored a wonder goal but Verona goalkeeper Francesco Benussi was alert to turn the effort from near the halfway line over his bar.
