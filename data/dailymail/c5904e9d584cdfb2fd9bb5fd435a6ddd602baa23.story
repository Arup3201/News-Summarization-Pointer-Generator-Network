Anne Hathaway apparently 'threw a fit' when she saw a photo of the dress Amanda Seyfried would be wearing to the Oscars.

The Les Miserables star, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, had planned to wear a gown by her good friend Valentino, but changed her mind after Miss Seyfried shared an iPhone snap of her own Alexander McQueen creation - which was very similar - during a rehearsal.

'Anne was like, "WTF?"' a source told Us Weekly. 'She started throwing a 
fit!'

Given the cold shoulder: Anne Hathaway decided last-minute to wear Prada to the Oscars, despite being expected to wear a custom-made gown by her long-time favorite designer and friend, Valentino

The scene left Miss Seyfried, 27, 'ruffled', the source continued. 'Amanda didn't want to deal with it and 
left,' they said.

To her credit, Ms Hathaway, 30, did not try to persuade her fellow actress to change her dress,' they added, instead taking it upon herself to address the situation.

'Anne 
made the fashion, make-up, hair, and jewelry teams wait at her home for 
hours as she decided what to do about the dress debacle'

The decision backfired on her though, 
with her stylists and beauty teams objecting to the wait as she agonized
with stylist Rachel Zoe over the selection of a new gown, a second 
source told Us.

'Anne 
made the fashion, make-up, hair, and jewelry teams wait at her home for 
hours as she decided what to do about the dress debacle,' they said.

And after trading her planned Valentino gown for a pale pink Prada creation, she was forced to issue a public statement by way of apology to Valentino, whose press team had already sent out a press release announcing her choice, unaware of the last-minute switch.

Too similar? Ms Hathaway's decision was prompted when Amanda Seyfried (left) shared a photo of her Alexander McQueen gown, which was very like her chosen Valentino number (right)

In a statement issued to People, she explained: 'It came to my attention late Saturday 
night that there would be a dress worn to the Oscars that is remarkably 
similar to the Valentino I had intended to wear, and so I decided it was
best for all involved to change my plans.'

She insisted that the trade was not 
intended as a snub to Valentino, who designed the wedding gown she wore 
to marry husband Adam Shulman last September.

'Though I love the dress I did wear, it 
was a difficult last minute decision as I had so looked forward to 
wearing Valentino in honor of the deep and meaningful relationship I 
have enjoyed with the house and with Valentino himself,' she continued.

'I deeply regret any disappointment caused.'

Ms Hathaway first made reference to the gown switch when interviewed by Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet on Sunday.

'I didn't know what I was wearing until about three hours ago,' she told him. 'This was the one that spoke to me in the end.'

Her
dress choice undoubtedly came as a surprise to Valentino, whose fashion
house sent out a press release just before the awards show stating that
it would be dressing Anne Hathaway, Sally Field and Jennifer Aniston.

Close friends: Valentino (pictured with Ms Hathaway in one of his designs at the 2011 Oscars) has said that the actress is 'like my daughter'

The actress certainly caused a 
stir in her backless pink satin Prada gown - complete with a very perky 
bust line - which she accessorized with a sparkling Tiffany necklace.

Ms Hathaway has a long history of friendship with 80-year-old Valentino, who has said of the actress: 'She's a very good friend of mine. She's like my daughter.'

She has worn a number of his 
creations to awards ceremonies - including the bold red strapless number she 
wore to host the Oscars in 2011.
