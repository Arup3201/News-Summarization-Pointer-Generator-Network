Britain's showjumping golden oldies cantered to victory yesterday in a thrilling jump-off – ending a 60-year wait for an Olympic triumph.

For the four man team of Nick Skelton, Peter Charles, Scott Brash and Ben Maher – with an average age of 40 – it was also a victory over adversity.

Two of the quartet overcame serious injury, including a broken neck and fractured back, and a third faced up to the heartache of his marriage ending.

Skelton, 54, had a hip replacement 
last year and admits to ‘having a problem walking about’. But that 
didn’t stop the veteran of six Olympics jumping clear on nine-year-old 
stallion Big Star in front of a capacity crowd of 23,000 after Team GB 
had finished tied with the Netherlands.

His feat was then matched by Maher, 
29, on Tripple III.  Brash, 26, and two Dutch riders then had faults 
after knocking down fences – leaving Charles riding Vindicat needing to 
go clear in the riding equivalent of a penalty shootout.

The 52-year-old, who had competed in 
two earlier Olympics for Ireland, did not disappoint and held his nerve 
to huge roars of approval from the jubilant crowd as he went clear, 
punching the air as he completed his historic round.

Incredibly, six years ago he had 
feared he might not ride in competition again after a serious fall 
ruptured his spleen, shattering three ribs and breaking a vertebrae..

For Maher, the victory will have been 
particularly sweet after difficult weeks that saw his former wife, model
Kathleen Baker, marry again shortly before the Olympics at a lavish 
ceremony at the Dorchester.

The couple divorced after just 22 
months of their own marriage, in July 2011, and within four months Miss 
Baker was engaged to her new lover Justin Widdowson, whose 
multi-millionaire parents own Skelton’s horse Big Star.

Mr Widdowson is believed to have met 
Miss Baker through the equestrian world and their friendship blossomed 
while she was still married to the international rider.

That heartache could be put to one 
side yesterday as Skelton, Maher, Brash and Charles doffed their hats 
before dismounting to collect their medals to the roars of an adoring 
crowd.

Their golds swinging around their 
necks, they then remounted for a lap of honour. But one was not enough 
and they went round again, savouring the hurrahs of the crowd.

It was Britain’s first Olympic 
showjumping gold since Helsinki in 1952 when Colonel Harry Llewellyn on 
Foxhunter famously led the British team to victory on the final day – 
GB’s only gold medal there – and the first showjumping medal of any kind
in 28 years.

A delighted Skelton, who overcame a 
broken neck and hip replacement to continue as one of the world’s 
leading showjumpers, said: ‘I’m speechless, unbelievable. What a place 
to do it. I have never seen people like it. Unbelievable. The lads have 
done great. It’s a dream come true. Absolutely brilliant. Great for the 
country, great for our sport. It’s taken all these years.’

Charles doffs his cap to the frenzied crowd after coming through a tense jump-off

He then grabbed BBC presenter Clare 
Balding and gave her a bear hug and a kiss on her cheek. Miss Balding 
seemed a little taken aback but quickly regained her composure to 
continue with the broadcast.

The gold comes after the silver for 
Zara Phillips and the three-day eventing team last week. The British 
equestrian team is likely to have further medal success today when the 
dressage team of Carl Hester, Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte 
Dujardin go for gold.

Skelton, who will go for a second gold
in the individual event, said he was more nervous watching his 
team-mates than riding himself. ‘I wish I could have gone four times,’ 
he joked.

Britain went into yesterday’s second 
day tied for second place with Holland, Switzerland and Sweden, three 
penalties behind leaders Saudi Arabia, the eventual bronze medal 
winners. But at the end of an enthralling second round they shared the 
lead with Holland, which set up the astonishing finale.

Skelton and Scotsman Brash, riding 
Hello Sanctos on his Olympic debut, had both jumped clear, while Maher 
had an unlucky fence down and Charles collected five faults.

Final Dutch rider Gerco Schroder would
have won the competition in ‘normal time’ had he jumped clear, but four
faults then took it into extra time

Smiles all round as the British team soak up the crowd's acclaim

Leaping into the history books: The team's stunning achievements will be commemorated with this special stamp

At 54, Nick Skelton is our oldest gold medal winner for more than 40 years.

A remarkable feat considering he retired 11 years ago after breaking his neck in two places in a fall.He described the experience as hearing ‘a loud crack, literally in my head’.

The fall caused a ligament to snap, tearing a piece of bone away from his spine.

A year after he had titanium screwed into his head, he was back in the saddle. ‘If it had been just 5mm different, I’d have been dead,’ he said.

‘When they told me I’d never ride again I was in shock. You’ve done it all your life and then it suddenly just stops.

‘In the end it was down to my stallion, Arko III. I knew he could do everything. He was my incentive and inspiration. So when a German doctor said I could ride again, that was enough for me.’

Since then Skelton, who has also had a hip replacement and two knee operations, has won medals at seven championships.

His team-mate, Peter Charles, is two years younger at 52 and has also recovered from a serious spinal injury.

He ruptured his spinal sheath and broke a vertebrae and three ribs in a fall in 2006.

Born in Liverpool to an Irish mother, he had spent 20 years jumping for Ireland. But after recovering from his fall in 2007, he decided to switch nationality and become a British rider.
