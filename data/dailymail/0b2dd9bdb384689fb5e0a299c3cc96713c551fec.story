The entire International Space Station was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station.

The remarkable manoeuvre saw a European spacecraft ‘slow’ the speed of the station.

This changed the height of its orbit very slightly, by about 1.6 miles (2.5km), before the station was spun back again to its original position.

A European spacecraft was used to lower the orbit of the ISS yesterday (illustrated). The ATV was used to 'slow' the station and move it down by 2.5km. But to do so required Nasa to first spin the station 180 degrees. It was then spun back again when the boost was completed

To move the station, the thrusters of Esa’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) were fired. 

Usually, boosts are performed by a spacecraft docked to the ISS to raise the height of the space station or to avoid debris.

The orbit of the ISS is regularly maintained, sometimes several times a year, but it is fairly rare for an ATV to be used for the procedure. 

The Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) is an unmanned spacecraft built by Esa that is used to bring cargo to the ISS.

The latest to be docked to the station, ATV-5, was the fifth and final cargo spacecraft Esa was contracted to supply the station with.

ATVs are given names honouring great scientists, and this one was named after Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaître.

The previous four were named Jules Verne, Johannes Kepler, Edoardo Amaldi and Albert Einstein.

ATV-5 was launched on 29 July 2014 and arrived at the station on 12 August 2014. 

It does not have the capability to return to Earth, so on 27 February 2015 it will be sent to burn up in Earth's atmosphere - with waste from the ISS on board. 

By boosting ‘backwards’, the ISS speeds up in its orbit - and its altitude is slightly raised.

But in this instance, Nasa made the decision to lower the altitude of the space station by 1.6 miles (2.5km).

To do this, the ATV had to boost against the orbit of the ISS - and as it is docked to a Russian service module at the back of the station, the ISS had to be spun around so it was facing forwards.

This was done using thrusters and gyrsocopes on the station.

‘The boost was weak, so the crew noticed no change,’ a source at Esa told MailOnline.

‘By lowering the orbit of the ISS, what happens is the apogee [the point where the ISS is furthest from Earth, as its orbit is very slightly elliptical] is lowered by 2.5km [1.6 miles].'

Combined with the drift and drag from Earth's atmosphere, this will eventually bring the ISS down by a total of about 9.3 miles (15km).

This will lower the altitude of its orbit from about 258 miles (415km) to around 249 miles (400km). 

‘What this does is it sets up the phasing for the next docking, which is [Russia’s] Progress spacecraft,' the source continued, 'and it means Progress will not have to use as much fuel to catch up and get to the ISS.’ 

The major benefit of this is that the incoming spacecraft will be able to carry more cargo, as it will not need to carry as much fuel.

To lower the orbit of the 400,000kg ISS yesterday, it was first necessary to spin the entire station 180 degrees - to bring Esa's ATV round from the 'back' to the 'front'.

This was done using thrusters on board the station, which can alter its orientation.

Once the station had been spun, the ATV then fired its thrusters from 18.40.00 GMT to 18.44.49 GMT yesterday - just less than five minutes in total.

After this boost, the station was then spun back again to its original position.

The ISS also has reaction wheels on it - gyroscopes that can be spun to change the orientation of the station.

A source at Esa told MailOnline that the crew on the ISS would barely have felt the move, if at all, and would have continued with their regular activities as normal.

Boosts like this are sometimes performed by other spacecraft when the orbit of the ISS needs to be maintained, or it needs to avoid a bit of debris.

The use of an ATV to boost the station is fairly rare, though; the last time it was used for such a purpose was back in 2008, for an unplanned debris avoidance manoeuvre.

To lower the orbit of the 400,000kg ISS (pictured) yesterday, it was first necessary to spin the entire station 180 degrees - to bring Esa's ATV round from the 'back' to the 'front'. It is understood that, despite seeming fairly dramatic, spinning the station is actual a fairly routine manoeuvre - using its  thrusters and gyroscopes

To highlight how easy it is to move the ISS, this picture taken by Italian Esa astronaut Paolo Nespoli in 2011 shows the entire space station at a slight angle. The Space Shuttle is seen docked at the top, while a previous European ATV vehicle is seen docked at the bottom

It’s believed that one of the reason’s this boost was required is due to the explosion of Orbital Sciences’ Antares rocket on 28 October 2014.

This rocket had been due to carry the Cygnus spacecraft to the station, which would have brought vital cargo with it.

But the loss of the spacecraft means that others have to pick up the slack - so by lowering the orbit of the ISS, they can add slightly more cargo to their loads.

This means more essential items like food and tools can be carried.

While the ISS was not running critically low on any particular type of cargo, its understood by MailOnline that the water on board was reaching fairly low levels.

The arrival of ATV-5 in August, though, brought about 1,875lbs (850kg) of water to the station - the last 265lbs (120kg) of which were transferred to the ISS today.

An Esa source told MailOnline the reason for this was to make it easier for spacecraft to reach the space station

@highlight

This means they can carry less fuel and bring more cargo with them

@highlight

One reason this is needed is because of the explosion of an Antares rocket in October - which resulted in the loss of cargo on the Cygnus vehicle
