A tattooed lady and her boyfriend were turned away from a nightclub by bouncers because they had visible body art.

Miki Lane, 23, and her partner Jason Barker, 24, were told they could not enter Club Amadeus in Northallerton because they had tattoos on their arms.

The pair were told by security staff that it was club policy not to allow people with body art into the premises.

Miki Lane from Thirsk, North Yorkshire said she was outraged when she was turned away from the club 

Ms Lane, who has 23 tattoos said she want to dispel the old image that people who have body art are thugs 

Ms Lane, who works in a tattoo shop, was wearing a sleeveless dress when she tried to get into the club with her personal trainer boyfriend. She told bouncers she would be willing to cover up by wearing her jacket, but they said this was not allowed as all jackets had to be placed in the cloakroom.

Ms Lane, from Thirsk, claims that the club's bouncers were wrong to turn her and her boyfriend away from the club because of their tattoos. 

She claimed that her 23 tattoos are artistic and in no way offensive.

She said: 'We had never experienced this discrimination anywhere previously and I had been in to Club Amadeus before and had my tattoos in show and there had never been a problem.

'I used to work in a nursing home, and even the elderly residents wouldn't bat an eyelid.

'We were smartly dressed and all we wanted to do was have a dance and a bit of fun.

'There is not one offensive tattoo on either of us, they are artistic. In the past I know tattoos have had negative connotations, but these days I would say more than half the people my age have them.'

Ms Lane said she and her boyfriend had spent £30 on taxis to get to the North Yorkshire nightclub.  

Ms Lane added: ' When people see my tattoos the reaction is that they are interested in them.

'One in five people have tattoos, it's getting more socially acceptable, so it's wrong to stereotype people who have them as thugs.'

This comes as Starbucks has relaxed its tattoo restrictions about workers having body art at work. Now staff at the company can show their designs as long as they are deemed tasteful, and are not on their face or neck. 

The British Army has announced it will allow new recruits with visible tattoos on their hands or necks, overturning a previous ban. 

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'Tattoos have become more acceptable in society over the last decade and, in recent years, there has been an increasing number of personnel with tattoos on visible areas.' 

The club is owned by Northallerton businessman George Crow, who was unavailable for comment.

An employee confirmed the club's policy that tattoos cannot be on show in the venue.

He added: 'I believe it is the owner's preference.'
