Growing up in the shadow of the star known as Pretty Woman cannot be easy.

But it is even tougher when you are known as her ‘fat little sister’.

Julia Roberts’s youngest sibling Nancy Motes claims taunts from the Hollywood star drove her to weight loss surgery.

The younger, 'fatter', sister of a Hollywood A-lister: Nancy Motes opens up about her wight problems following gastric by-pass surgery and her relationship with Julia Roberts

Miss
 Motes, 37, who tried unsuccessfully to make it as a film actress 
herself, said Miss Roberts, 45, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of
 her weight, which peaked at 20st.

She
 got so tired of being known as ‘Julia Roberts’ fat little sister’ that 
she resorted to a £20,000 gastric bypass operation last year.

Miss
 Motes, whose other siblings Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, 
48, are also movie actors, said: ‘It makes me feel incredibly hurt and 
very sad.

‘When you’re in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it’s intimidating.

Not too close: Julia, pictured, outshone her younger sister Nancy, who made complaints about the Oscar winner in August

‘I
 think that growing up as Pretty Woman’s little sister has definitely 
made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside. A lot 
of my life I felt judged for my weight.’

Miss
 Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when Miss 
Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as call girl Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman.

The actress, who had won a Golden 
Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second 
for Pretty Woman.

Miss Motes, who described herself as an ‘awkward’ 
child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of 
her ‘very pretty and very popular’ sister.

She
 said: ‘When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just 
let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite 
clear to me and in a not so nice manner.

'Julia did not want to see me go
 down that path [of acting] … So I just got a lot of criticism from 
Julia, which was very discouraging for me.’

After
 graduating from high school in 1995, Miss Motes, now a production 
assistant on TV show Glee, auditioned for roles in Hollywood while 
working as a waitress. But she could not afford to continue so returned 
to Georgia.

Three years ago 
Miss Motes moved back to Los Angeles, after meeting her fiancé John 
Dilbeck. But she claims Miss Roberts started taunting her about her 
weight again days after she arrived.

With her weight soaring, she 
finally decided to have a gastric bypass fitted.

Miss
 Motes could not afford the £20,000 fee, but rather than ask Miss 
Roberts, who is worth £90million, for financial help, she took out a 
loan.

She has lost 7st 
since the operation last June and plans to marry in May, but her 
relationship with her sister remains unsettled and she is unsure whether
 Miss Roberts will be at the wedding.

She
 said: ‘It’s a work in progress, it’s not going to be fixed overnight, 
nor do I think it’s going to be fixed by me just getting skinny.’
