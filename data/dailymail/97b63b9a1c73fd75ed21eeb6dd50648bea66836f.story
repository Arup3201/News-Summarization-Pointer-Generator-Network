When great-grandmother  Maureen Holt asked the man behind the counter at
 her local shop to check her EuroMillions ticket, he told her she had 
won nothing.

Farrakh Nizzar, however, was being somewhat economical with the truth.

For the ticket was actually a £1million jackpot winner.

In for the win: Maureen Holt, 77, and husband Fred could not believe that 'Lucky' had tried to dupe them and they could be millionaires

After lying to the 77-year-old, he asked: ‘Do you want me to throw the ticket away?’ and Mrs Holt replied: ‘Well, if there’s nothing on it you may as well.’

Nizzar, 30, later phoned the lottery hotline and tried to claim the fortune for himself, claiming he had bought the ticket at the Best One shop.

He boasted about his amazing win to the managers of the shop and said the win was ‘life-changing’.

He claimed he had already drawn up a shopping list.

But Camelot questioned Nizzar after discovering the winning lottery ticket had actually been bought at a nearby supermarket in Oldham. Realising he was not the genuine winner, investigators called in the police before launching a hunt for the legitimate owner.

Luckily, they were able to trace Mrs Holt because she had used her Tesco Clubcard when she bought the ticket, and the store had her contact details. CCTV footage also confirmed she had bought it and yesterday Camelot was able to confirm Mrs Holt and her husband were the rightful winners.

Caught out: Farrakh Nizzar told  Maureen Holt that her prize ticket was worthless and then started planning what he would spend her winnings on

The mother of seven, whose husband Fred, 80, still works for a security firm, said: ‘I just can’t believe he did this, but at least he got caught. This money will mean my husband can finally give up work and we can enjoy our retirement.’

Nizzar, of Manchester, went on the run when he realised his deceit had been exposed, telling his bosses he was going away on a long holiday. He was eventually arrested by police and appeared before Oldham Magistrates’ Court this week, where he admitted fraud by false representation. He will be sentenced on August 20.

The couple had known Nizzar – who they knew as Lucky – for about a year and considered the shop worker trustworthy and friendly.

Mrs Holt said: ‘I thought he was a nice young man. He knew me and my husband by name. Everyone calls him Lucky but he wasn’t very lucky this time.’

She said they had been on holiday when the EuroMillions draw was made on June 22. On their return from Spain Mrs Holt went into the Best One convenience store and asked Nizzar to check the numbers for her.

She explained: ‘He said “Do you want me to throw it away?” and I said “Well, if there’s nothing on it you may as well”.

‘Then a few days later a lady from Camelot knocked on the door and asked about the ticket. She said there’s a possibility a winning ticket has been presented that’s yours. I couldn’t believe it.’

The couple, who have seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, said they have been so upset by the investigation that they haven’t been able to sleep.

Mr Holt said: ‘It’s kept us awake at night. I was really terribly shocked when I found out what happened. It was unbelievable. We feel let down.’ 

Furious: Musood Ahmed 29, boss of the convenience store where Mrs Holt was tricked, says he thought 'something was not right' when Nizzar said he had won the lottery

The couple aim to buy a new car, make some improvements to their small terraced house in Oldham, and spoil their large family.

Mrs Holt said: 'It's such a relief that it's over. It's still all a bit surreal.'

Mr
 Holt added: 'I officially retired 15 years ago but I've still been 
working but I'm only doing two days a week because they said I should 
wind down. But I'm going to give up work now. It's just a dream.'

The owners of the shop, brothers Mohammed Yasin, 42, and Musood Ahmed, 29, said they were furious at the betrayal of their customers.

Mr Ahmed said: ‘He was talking about buying cars and all sorts. But something didn’t sound right. Eventually we sat him down and said if that ticket isn’t yours you are in trouble. He swore on the Koran and on his mum and dad’s life it was his ticket.’ 

Mr Yasin and Mr Ahmed said they would now look at improving staff training and CCTV coverage.

Mr Yasin said: 'I feel absolutely gutted. Especially because it's happened to Fred and Maureen - we've known them for years.

'They are some of the nicest people you will ever meet.'

Camelot said it had rigorous security checks in place to ensure the identity of legitimate ticket holders.
