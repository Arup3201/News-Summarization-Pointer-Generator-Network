Dr Dorin Scladan removed the 11lb (5kg) growth from the woman, who had believed she was pregnant

A Romanian woman who believed she was pregnant was devastated to be told she actually had an 11lb tumour inside her uterus.

Madalina Neagu, 42, arrived at a hospital in with severe pain in her abdomen and told doctors she believed she was in labour.

As a result, medics at Botosani County Hospital prepared to operate to deliver the child.

But after carrying out tests, they were shocked to discover she wasn't pregnant at all.

Instead, she was actually carrying a 11lbs (5kg) tumour inside her uterus.

One of the doctors treating her, Dr Dorin Scladan, 47, said: 'As the woman told us she was pregnant, we initially expected pregnancy complications.

'In fact, the size of her belly was quite similar to that of a nine-month pregnant woman, so we didn't have any reason to doubt what she told us.'

Dr Sclandan and his colleage Dr Camelia Todica, 43, carried out an operation to remove the tumour.

The patient was then transferred to intensive care - and doctors say she will recover.

Dr Scladan said: 'We don't often see a tumour of this size and in this location.'

The news comes after last year MailOnline reported on the story of Lorna Fulton, 44, who desperately wanted a family and believed she was pregnant when her stomach began to swell. 

She had ballooned to a size 26 and her waistline had been expanding despite months of dieting. 

But while she hoped this was a sign she was expecting, specialists discovered a huge ovarian cyst.

Mrs Fulton was forced to undergo a full hysterectomy at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary where medics drained more than 32 litres of fluid from her stomach. 

It was revealed she had been carrying around a 5st cyst, a sac of fluid that forms on the ovary, for months. 

She recovered after the operation, and although she now cannot have children, says she feels 'lucky to be alive'.

Doctors carried out emergency surgery to remove the tumour from the woman's uterus, and she was transferred to intensive care

And in 2012, MailOnline reported on the story of Kayleigh Terry, 21, who believed she was pregnant with her first child after gaining weight.

But she was terrified to discover she actually had cancer.

An ultrasound scan revealed she had a large cancerous growth which covered an area from her breast to her lower abdomen.

She was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma and had emergency chemotherapy to shrink the potentially deadly tumour.

Miss Terry lost her hair and eye-lashes along with 3st in weight after the shrunken tumour was removed a few months later.

But after treatment, she was given the all clear, and now hopes to start her own family.
