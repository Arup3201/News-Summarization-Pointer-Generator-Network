'Scrummy': Soprano Laura Wright has hit back at comments that classical singers are too thin

‘Scrummy Soprano’ Laura Wright yesterday launched a war of words with Dame Kiri te Kanawa, describing her recent comments about singers being too thin as ‘stupid’.

Dame Kiri, 69, stirred controversy last month when she said of young singers: ‘Sometimes they’re more beautiful than their voice, and that’s a bit of a sadness.’

She added: ‘When I was at the Met [in New York], I would see these young girls, starving hungry but terrified to put on weight.

‘They couldn’t even go down to the canteen and eat in front of anyone because they were being watched.

‘You have got to have beef on you if you’re going to sing.’

Laura, 23, who has sung for the Queen six times in the past year, said: ‘It is so stupid she has highlighted body stuff.

‘I find it strange that she is commenting on girls’ figures.’

‘She pointed out sexualisation of young women in the classical industry and that frustrates me.

‘I just received my first-class degree at the Royal College of Music and at no point in my four-year course did my figure come into it.

‘For me it is about being healthy, I’m not thin or enormous, but just a sporty shape. I look after my vocal muscles and my other muscles as well and I don’t feel the pressure to diet to go on stage thin.’

The divas’ disagreement comes as both women take to the stage tonight in the last of the Coronation Jubilee Festival Gala evenings at Buckingham Palace.

Wright’s reaction to Kiri’s comments are in stark contrast to Welsh star Katherine Jenkins conciliatory attitude about Dame Kiri’s scathing comments about ‘crossover’ singers such as herself.

Dame Kiri told The Radio Times in May when Katherine’s name was mentioned: ‘We should talk about serious classical singers if you want to stick to the subject.’

Ms Jenkins, 33, who will also perform tonight, said: ‘I don’t think Dame Kiri ever says these things. I think she’s been misquoted, as is so often the case.

‘When I met her, she was a lovely person, so I’m going to ignore it.’

Meanwhile, Ms Wright has revealed that some of her tutors at the Royal College of Music believed that her heavy concert schedule would be a distraction from her studies.

Despite her outstanding academic success, Laura added: ‘Some tutors at the College disagreed with what I have been doing and haven’t been supportive.’
