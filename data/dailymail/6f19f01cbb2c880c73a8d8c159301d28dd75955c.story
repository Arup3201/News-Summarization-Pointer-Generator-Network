Actor-comedian Tracy Morgan has been moved from a hospital to a rehabilitation facility as he recovers from a serious auto accident in New Jersey, his spokesman said Friday.

The former star of 30 Rock is showing signs of improvement, but has a long road to full recovery, spokesman Lewis Kay said in an email. Morgan suffered a broken leg and broken ribs in the June 7 accident.

Kay didn't identify the rehab facility where Morgan is staying, saying only that it is in New Jersey.

Legal action: Tracy Morgan was released from rehab on Saturday as he is suing Wal Mart after one of the company's truck drivers smashed into his limo leaving him seriously injured

Not guilty plea: Kevin Roper (leaving court on June 11), a Wal-Mart truck driver from Georgia, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7

Morgan's limousine van was hit from 
behind by a Wal-Mart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. Morgan's friend 
James McNair, 62, of Peekskill, New York, was killed and Morgan and two 
other men were seriously injured.

On
 Thursday, a report by federal transportation safety investigators said 
the truck driver was speeding before he slammed into the limousine van 
on a stretch of the turnpike where the speed limit was lowered to 45 mph
 due to construction.

The
 report also raised anew questions about driver Kevin Roper's work hours
 and whether they were in conflict with federal safety guidelines.

The
 35-year-old Roper, of Jonesboro, Georgia, has pleaded not guilty to one
 count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto.

Devastating damage: Investigators have released images that show the extent of the damage to the Mercedes Benz limo van Morgan was riding in when the accident happened

Returning to strength: A report on the crash that seriously injured the comedian says the driver of a tractor-trailer was speeding before the crash

Roper had been on the job about 13 1/2 hours at the time of the crash, the report concluded. Federal rules permit truck drivers to work up to 14 hours a day, with a maximum of 11 hours behind the wheel.

Had Roper continued to his eventual destination in Perth Amboy, he would have been pushing the 14-hour limit if he drove at the speed limit. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman didn't comment Thursday on Roper's hours or his itinerary.

Messages left Thursday at several phone numbers listed for Roper's attorney were not immediately returned.

Morgan's assistant, Jeffrey Millea, of Shelton, Connecticut, has been upgraded from serious to fair condition, according to Kay. Hospital officials said this week that comedian Ardie Fuqua, of Jersey City, remains in critical condition.
