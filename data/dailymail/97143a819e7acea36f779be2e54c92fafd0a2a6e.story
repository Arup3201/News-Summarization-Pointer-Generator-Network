Britain will be gripped by an 'arctic airmass' as freezing snow blizzards of up to 70mph are set to bring further travel chaos.  

The Met Office has issued yellow warnings - urging the public to be aware - for ice across the entire country and snow across the Midlands, northern England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

It comes after 'thundersnow' storms battered large parts of northern Britain on Thursday, with up to 9in of snow falling in some parts of the UK.

With temperatures remaining low overnight, forecasters have warned that ice is likely to form on road surfaces and more snow is expected on high ground, especially across Scotland.

But much of the UK will be affected by the conditions, with several crashes already reported today, including a seven-car pile-up in Cornwall.  

The Met Office have said on Sunday and Monday temperatures will drop well below freezing and will feel like -6C in parts of Scotland due to the northerly winds. 

Strong winds of up to 70mph are predicted in north-west Scotland, meaning blizzard conditions are likely, experts say.

MeteoGroup forecaster Chris Hogan said 'heavy snow showers' were forecast in higher areas as a band of cold weather moved south across England. 

London could also see a 'dusting' of snow, although sleet and rain were more likely, he added.

The Met Office's chief forecaster Eddie Carroll said: 'Road surface temperatures will fall widely below freezing, leading to a risk of ice on untreated surfaces.

'This will be exacerbated by showers in places, more especially across Scotland, where 2-5cm of fresh snowfall may accumulate above 150m, with up to 10cm settling above 300m.

'Further south, a mixture of rain, sleet and wet snow is likely, with most of any settling snow taking place above about 200m. However, wet roads at low levels will contribute to the risk of ice formation.'

The Met Office said sleet and snow showers would affect parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, with snow falling to lower levels and extending further south through the day.

Longer spells of sleet and snow are also possible, especially across the high ground of Scotland and north-east England.

Mr Carroll added: 'A very cold airmass will spread southwards across Scotland and Northern Ireland accompanied by strong winds, spreading southwards into northern England and north Wales later in the day.

'Frequent showers are likely to form in this airmass, and with the cold air snow is likely to accumulate, even to low levels in places. 

'Periods of enhanced snowfall are possible within this general flow, perhaps more especially across the high ground of Scotland and north-east England, but these details are more uncertain.

'There is the potential for disruption throughout this period due to the accumulating snow and ice but also with temporary blizzard conditions leading to very difficult driving conditions.'

Seven vehicles have been involved in a crash on the A30 near Bodmin, Cornwall today. It happened along a 750ft stretch of the road, and several people needed treatment for their injuries, police said this morning.

The smash happened as snow fell again in many places during the night and forecasters warned of a weekend of wild weather, with gale force winds and more snow. 

A car and lorry crash on the M6, near Cheshire, also caused problems earlier - closing all but one lane southbound.

This afternoon there was an accident on the M8 near Glasgow and a three-car smash on the M20 near Kent.

Manchester Airport, which was forced to close both of its runways for several hours on Thursday, said a total of 36 flights inbound or outbound had been cancelled yesterday.

It said on its website: 'We are fully open today, but as things get back to normal and aircraft get back to where they should be, passengers are advised to check with their airline for specific flight queries as some may be subject to delays.' 

Yesterday, commuters across the UK faced nightmare delays after accidents and treacherous conditions on motorways resulted in multiple lane closures, leaving thousands of people stuck in traffic as they made their way to work. 

The M4 was facing delays early this morning after a multiple car pile-up late last night. 

Queues stretched along the motorway after the smash at junction 15 near Swindon, Wilts, as sleet and rain which had fallen during the day turned to black ice. 

Several people needed treatment but nobody was killed in the accident which involved at least five vehicles near the junction with the A346. 

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said 'People are travelling too fast for the conditions - the road surfaces are lethal in places, like slippery glass.'
