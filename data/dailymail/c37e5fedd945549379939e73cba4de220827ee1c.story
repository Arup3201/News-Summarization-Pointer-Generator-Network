Heavenly match: Ressurrection and Deven met at a Washington, DC-area homeless shelter when they were both down on their luck in 2011. They've since married and even started their own non-profit organization geared toward helping the needy

A Washington, DC-area couple who met while they were both living at a homeless shelter in 2011 have since become blissfully married and are now telling their heartwarming tale.

Ressurrection Graves was a struggling entrepreneur who lost her business, home and relationship at the same time. She says she prayed to God, who told her to go to a specific area homeless shelter.

That's where she met Deven, a veteran struggling to figure out the world after leaving the service. Their irrefutable chemistry led to a first date and an engagement five months later.

While the road was mostly smooth 
toward their eventual nuptials, not everything was peachy in the 
beginning for Ressurrection and Deven.

'It
 was a stormy night when Ressurrection came into the homeless shelter,' 
Deven reminisced to the Huffington Post. 'I asked her name, and she 
asked why I needed to know that information.'

After she selflessly helped him spruce up his resume, Deven took Ressurrection out to an area McDonald's.

Deven remembers the first shared meal fondly.

'She picked me up and we went to McDonalds to use some coupons that were given to me. I still remember what she ordered -- a fish sandwich, no tartar sauce, fries and orange juice,' he said.

Ressurrection isn't as nostalgiac.

'I hate McDonalds,' she laughed. 'But he had a coupon.'

Despite her initial reluctance, Graves eventually gave in to the feelings she was having for Deven.

Ressurrection Graves was a struggling entrepreneur who lost her business, home and relationship at the same time. She says she prayed to God, who told her to go to a specific area homeless shelter.

'We talked for several weeks,' said 
Graves. 'I was thinking about being with him, but there was a lot I 
needed to figure out first,

'He
 approached me one day and said, "I want to be more than friends,"' 
Graves went on. 'It wasn't a line. I told him that I could be his gift 
when he left the shelter. We left together a week or so later.'

Five
 months later, Graves heard of a housing opportunity for her and 
daughter, but for her new love to join them they needed to be married.

So they started to plan a wedding. And on August 28, 2013, they tied the knot in honor of their made-in-heaven match and also the anniversary of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech.

The wedding theme was 'I Had a Dream, and It Came True.'

Since then, the couple have made a point of giving back to the community.

They even began right after their I Dos when they struck out to area parks and handed food out to the needy.

They've also started an organization called Glory Soldiers Global that seeks to help eradicate poverty and prevent child sexual abuse.

Now the happy couple lives in the Washington, DC area and run a non-profit dedicated to helping eradicate homelessness and helping people who are victims of childhood sexual abuse
