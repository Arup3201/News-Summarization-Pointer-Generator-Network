The mother of two children allegedly murdered by their nanny spoke of her grief in public for the first time - and said that her ‘entire existence was shattered’.

Marina Krim said that she ‘lost two of my best friends’ when she found daughter Lulu, six, and two-year-old son Leo stabbed to death at the family's Manhattan apartment last October.

She lamented the loss of her ‘simple, charming old life’ focused on her children and said that she now struggles to see the ‘magic in the present every day’.

Mrs Krim, 36, laid out her utter 
devastation in a letter that was read to 150 guests at a Manhattan 
charity event in honor of her late children on Saturday.

Among those attending the event was Mrs Krim's husband Kevin Krim, 37, a CNBC executive. It is not thought that the couple's surviving daughter Nessie, three, was at the event.

The little girl only survived the attack because she was out with her mother at the time.

The Krim’s nanny Yoseyln Ortega, 50, was last week ruled fit to stand trial and will now face a jury for two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder.

Mrs Krim’s letter, which was not read by her, said: ‘Five months ago, on an ordinary October day in New York City, I lost two of my best friends, my six-year-old daughter Lulu and my two-year-old son Leo.

‘Nessie our middle child, just three years old at the time, became an only child. My entire existence was shattered.

‘My simple charming old life, from the moment I woke up till the moment I went to sleep, revolved around my kids and I was extremely proud of that.'

The event was in support of the Lulu & Leo Fund which they have set up to raise money for children’s education programs.

Mrs Krim’s letter said: ‘Kids live in the present and we should too. My most magical moments with Lulu and Leo almost never involved material items.

'It was the look of pride I would see on Lulu's face when I would pick her up from art class. It was watching Leo's deep brown curious eyes track a caterpillar in the grass.

‘My most important challenge is to remember and see the magic in the present every day.’

When Mrs Krim returned to her Upper West Side apartment on the day of the killing, she was confronted with an unimaginable sight. Her two slain children were lying in the bath covered in blood and Ortega had stabbed herself.

In the letter Mrs Krim said: ‘She [Ortega] did a horrible, horrible thing. We just want justice - that's all we can hope for.’

The Krim family have until now used other ways to speak about their grief and have not appeared in public. One day after the tragedy Mr Krim wrote in a text message to friends that they were ‘obviously heartbroken’.

They have also set up a Facebook page for the Lulu & Leo Fund and one post they said that Nessie ‘saves us every day’.
