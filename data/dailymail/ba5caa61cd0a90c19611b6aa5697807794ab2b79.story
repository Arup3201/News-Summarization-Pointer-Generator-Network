A group of more than 100 members of Princeton’s class of 1978 have penned an open letter condemning their fellow alumna Susan Patton, better known as the Princeton Mom, for her recent comments about campus rape.

Patton, a 1977 graduate of the prestigious Ivy League college who was the president of her class, was catapulted to fame last year when she wrote a column offering female college students advice on how to find a husband.

The controversy stirred by the op-ed resulted in a book deal for the outspoken Mrs Patton, who last March released her self-help bestseller titled Marry Smart: Advice for Finding The One.

Under fire: A group of 123 members of Princeton's class of 1978 have written an open letter condemning Susan 'Princeton Mom' Patton for her comments on date rape

But the self-proclaimed Princeton Mom, whose two sons also attended her alma mater, did not stop at dolling out tips on making a good match.

In December, Patton dived head-first into the University of Virginia rape scandal, claiming that sexual assault could be a 'learning experience' for female students.

During an interview on CNN, Patton described rape as a ‘clumsy hook-up melodrama' and criticized women who find themselves in a precarious situation for not telling the man they're with to stop and leave.

Patton sounded a similar note a month later in her appearance on Fox & Friends, during which she once again weighed in on sexual abuse.

At her appearance, Patton came out strongly against teaching children about rape and molestation in schools, saying that sexual assault often can be chalked up to 'bad manners.'

These recent pronouncements on the subject by Susan Patton have led a group of 123 Princeton alumni to speak out against her this week in a letter published in The Daily Princetonian, the university's student newspaper.

‘We believe we speak for the great majority of Princeton moms and dads, as well as alumni who do not have children, in saying rape in general — and date rape in particular — is inexcusable, rape survivors deserve our help and support and anyone who sexually assaults another person should be prosecuted legally,’ the open letter read in part.

The alumni behind the strongly worded missive went on to accuse Patton of shaming victims of rape by placing the blame squarely on them.

‘Rape and sexual assault are violent crimes against persons of any gender,’ the letter stated. ‘It is particularly disturbing when college students violate the trust of people they know.’

The group of alumni brought up another letter, penned by Patton herself to the Daily Princetonian in March 2014, in which she compared a woman who gets raped to someone who doesn't look both ways before crossing the street and gets hit by a car.

In response to her controversial comments at the time, more than 200 faculty members signed an open letter to the student paper speaking out against Patton and expressing their support for victims of sexual abuse.

‘Yet the wider world continues to see this woman dressed in orange and black associating her out-of-touch personal beliefs with our alma mater,’ the 123 Princeton graduates stated this week. ‘We — along with many other alumni — see these views as outrageous and unworthy of being associated with Princeton.’

The alumni concluded their letter by calling on the Princeton administration to continue striving to create a climate where accusations of sexual abuse are taken seriously.

Class of 1978 graduate Julie List, who spearheaded the open letter against Patton, said that unlike her previous relatively harmless remarks urging young women to lose weight and get regular manicures in order to land a good husband, her opinions on campus rape could prove ‘actively damaging.’

‘With this, I strongly felt she was really, really undermining the young women who might have finally gotten the courage to come forward if they were raped by an acquaintance or on a date,’ Ms List told the Post.

Speaking to the Washington Post, Susan Patton said some of her comments have been taken out of context.

School colors: The alumni have accused Patton of going around dressed in Princeton's colors of orange and black and making herself out to be the voice of the university 

‘I have never said that rape is a learning experience. What I said is when women drink a little bit, get a little tipsy, have consensual sex with a man they know they shouldn’t have had sex with and wake up in the morning and think, “Oh my God, what did I do?” — that is not rape. It’s a learning experience,’ she said.

Patton also has denied the alumni's claim that she has appointed herself a spokeswoman for the university by using the moniker Princeton Mom and wearing the Ivy League school’s colors.

'I'm speaking for myself,’ she insisted.
