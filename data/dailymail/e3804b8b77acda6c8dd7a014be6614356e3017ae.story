There's nothing worse than having unexpected guests arrive when you haven't got any food in - so perhaps it's no surprise this eagle got a cool reception when it gate-crashed this gathering of cranes.

The bird of prey didn't have a prayer if it thought it could steal some of the food the cranes had managed to scavenge in the snow.

Normally used to being the predator, the eagle clearly didn't like having the tables turned, and flew away to safety.

Where eagle dares: The birds clash in mid-air as the crane defends its food

Feathered friends... and enemies: Outnumbered three to one, the eagle is soon forced to flee the scene

Sorry - must fly! Having done its best to ruin the cranes' meal, the eagle makes its getaway... but not without crashing into one of its rivals

Japanese photographer Masatsugu Ohashi, 
41, was on hand to snap the white tailed eagle attempt to
take on a flock of Japanese red crowned cranes in Akan Hokkaido, 
southern Japan.

The
snow fall came as bad news for these birds as the berries 
and fish they normally eat were covered, leaving them to battle against each other for 
whatever they could find.

The cranes blended in against the backdrop but a beautiful red colouring on the top of their heads helped them to stand out against the snow.

The amateur photographer, who has been dabbling with photography for the past eight years, said: 'It was really interesting to watch these birds and see how they responded to each other during the battle.

'I was amazed and surprised to see how brave the cranes were when they defended themselves.

'It's usually the eagles who end up stealing fish so I was glad that the cranes came out top on this one and had a chance for them to get their own back.'

Bird brain: The eagle didn't give up straight away and made several attempts to steal food from the cranes before taking the hint

Watch the birdie: The battle is over and the eagle flies away, defeated
