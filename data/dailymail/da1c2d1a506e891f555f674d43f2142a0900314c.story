Rangers winger David Templeton has warned his team-mates they will find themselves on the wrong end of another cup shock if they repeat Saturday's dismal display against Alloa.

The former Hearts forward rescued a point for the sloppy Ibrox side with just six minutes left at the Indodrill Stadium as he cancelled out Jonathan Tiffoney's first-half Wasps opener.

The 1-1 draw now leaves the Glasgow side trailing Scottish Championship rivals Hearts by three points in the race for promotion.

Rangers' David Templeton celebrates his goal but admits his side have to improve in midweek

But Templeton is worried Falkirk will not give them a similar reprieve when the Light Blues take on the Bairns in Tuesday night's League Cup third-round clash.

Ally McCoist has already suffered a number of cup upsets during his four-year spell as boss - including a major upset at the Falkirk stadium three years ago before their liquidation crisis.

And Templeton has warned they will find themselves on the end of another disaster if they do not improve on their weekend showing.

'We definitely won't get away with this kind of performance against Falkirk,' said the 25-year-old. 'We did not play to the standard we showed against Raith and Inverness last week and it cost us.

'The plastic pitch at Alloa didn't help. It was one of the older surfaces and was really sticky.

'Falkirk's pitch is one of the newer astros and come Tuesday I'm sure we will play a lot better.'

Rangers had fallen behind to Jonathan Tiffoney's goal and needed Templeton's late goal to rescue a point

Templeton started Saturday's match on the bench but made an early entrance after Lewis Macleod limped off with a foot injury. Nicky Clark was also replaced just before the break after damaging his right shoulder, while Lee Wallace missed the game completely with a calf strain.

All three are doubts for Tuesday's match but Templeton believes there are others in the Ibrox squad ready to step up.

He said: 'It's disappointing for Lewis to pick up an injury as he has been brilliant for us this season. Hopefully he will be okay - I don't think it was anything too bad.

'We also lost Nicky and had Lee Wallace out as well. Lee and Lewis are massive for us down that left-hand side while Nicky has been doing really well for us too.

'It looked like Nicky picked up a bad one though. It's never nice to see guys picking up injuries but it gives others like myself a chance to come on and get a chance.

'It was good for me that I was able to get on. The first half I didn't do too well but I had a better second half and then got the goal, which was nice.'

Templeton levelled the match following Tiffony's clever header 10 minutes before the interval when he tapped home from close range after Lee McCulloch's fierce shot was spilled by home keeper John Gibson.

But Jon Daly was denied a stoppage-time winner by an offside flag.

'It was good to get the equaliser but I thought we could have snatched it late on,' said the winger. 'We had a couple of chances and I'm not sure how close big Jon's offside goal was.

'But really, based on how poor we were in the first half, I don't think we did enough to win it.'
