From cellulite busters to intense firmers, in this day and age there are countless lotions and potions for aging legs.

But now, one hosiery line has set about making life easier for women looking to revitalise their bottom half.

Charnos has introduced its new SS13 ‘Wellbeing’ collection which features tights containing rejuvenating properties that promise to help women feel and look fantastic. 

Charnos Energising Support range promise to fight the first signs of leg aging

The tights from the Energising Support range have been created with a special 'microencapsulate blend' made up of Vitamin E, Honey, Kelp and Shea Butter, which each have their own beneficial properties.

Vitamin E, which is known for its anti-oxidant properties, helps protect the skin from premature aging while Sea Kelp, a marine plant extract that is rich in nutrients, promises to improve skin tone and stimulate blood flow that can reduce the build-up of cellulite.

The tights also contain Shea Butter - a natural oil that helps to soften and moisturise the dry, flaky skin as well as a touch of honey, which is prized for its anti-bacterial and healing properties.

This special microencapsulated blend is incorporated into the yarn and as the wearer moves the ingredients are released onto the skin throughout the day.

Containing shea butter, vitamin E and sea kelp, the tights energise tired legs and their compression helps firm

The yarn has also been designed with a soft and gentle compression support to reduce leg ‘tiredness’. 

'Traditionally support hosiery that 
provides a level of compression was developed for medical requirements 
and were perceived as being a bit of a "granny" garment. 

'The actual 
feel of the support hosiery was thick and uncomfortable to wear, so 
there was no appeal for younger style conscious hosiery wearer so Charnos saw a gap in the market,' John Roskalns, Charnos Managing Director told MailOnline.

'Our aim is to engage the younger 
hosiery wearer with hosiery that is wearable, functional yet provides 
them with greater benefits so we turned to the cosmetic industry for 
inspiration and expertise.

'The injection of micro encapsulate 
ensures that the hosiery has a benefit to the condition of the skin as 
well as circulation, thanks to the compression element,' he said.

The tights, which are available at the 
likes of House of Fraser, Debenhams and Fenwicks, last for 25 washes and
prices start from £6.00
