Footy star Andrew Fifita has reportedly kicked off during a burst of road rage on Sunday afternoon.

The Cronulla Sharks player allegedly punched and kicked a Subaru car on Taren Point Road, Miranda, in southern Sydney,  after angrily jumping out of the Jeep he was driving.

The 25-year-old also allegedly chucked an object at the Subaru, Acting Inspector Michael Stuart told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'Both vehicles stopped on Taren Point Road. The 25-year-old allegedly made threats and punched and kicked the vehicle causing some damage to it,' said Acting Inspector Stuart.

Fifita is said to have made a statement to police after the alleged victim reported the incident.

The Sharks released a statement to Triple M saying they were aware of the incident.

'The Club are aware of an incident last night involving Andrew Fifita. No Charges have been laid and police investigations are continuing. The NRL have been informed. No further comment will be made at this stage.'

The 116kg Shark had to have surgery on August 11 to to fix the break.

He wrote on Twitter: 'Devastated I snapped both bones in my arm. Can’t wait till 2015. But still the boys have a job to do first. Thanks 4 da nice tweets.'

The 6ft 4 star from Blacktown, Sydney, was locked in a nasty contract dispute with Canterbury Bulldogs at the beginning of the year.

He was thought to have agreed to a $3.2 million four-year deal to leave the Sharks but it never came through.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Fifita for comment.
