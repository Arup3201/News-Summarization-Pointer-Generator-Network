The unclaimed £63.8 million EuroMillions prize has been narrowed down to a ticket bought in Hertfordshire.

Its holder has still to come forward to accept the windfall, nearly a fortnight after the draw.

This is now the longest time such a large win has gone unclaimed.

It could be you! The winning ticket was bought in the Stevenage and Hitchin area but has not been claimed

Two ticket holders hit the jackpot on June 8 - one in Belgium and one in the UK.

The owner of the British ticket, bought in the Stevenage and Hitchin area, will claim £63,837,543.60 - sending them soaring into fifth place on the National Lottery rich list.

According to the Sunday Times Rich List,
the winner would be more wealthy than Daniel Radcliffe, who has an 
estimated £54 million fortune, and richer than Princes William and Harry
(£40 million).

Meanwhile, the £63,837,532.60 jackpot prize is accruing interest of 
£3,585.40 every day and in the 13 days since the draw, has earned 
£46,610.20, private bank Coutts has said.

According to the National Lottery, the ticket holder could use the pot 
of cash to buy either a Boeing 737 with a cruising speed of 485mph; 12 
Diamond Rose iPhone 4s, made with rose gold and set with 500 diamonds; 
60 Eurocopter EC120s with top speeds of 172mph; 90,647 pairs of 
Christian Louboutin shoes or 2,520kg of Beluga caviar.

But the winner - who could be an individual or a syndicate - will have to come forward by 11pm on December 5 or the cash will be given to the National Lottery Good Causes fund.

Camelot spokesman said: 'We’re desperate to find this mystery ticket holder and unite them with their winnings and we’re urging everyone to try checking in the pockets of clothing, in wallets, bags and down the back of the sofa - someone out there could literally be sitting on a fortune.

'We have the champagne on ice and our fingers crossed that the lucky winner comes forward to claim their win.'

Other multimillion-pound jackpot winners include Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, who won £161 million last July.

A ticket holder banked £113,019,926 in October 2010 but decided not to go public, and Dave Dawes and wife Angela, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, claimed £101,203,600 last October.

Camelot can make a pay-out, at its discretion, where a ticket has been lost, stolen or destroyed - but only if a claim is submitted within 30 days of the draw and if there is sufficient evidence. VIDEO: Winner wanted! Do you have the missing winning Euromillions ticket?...
