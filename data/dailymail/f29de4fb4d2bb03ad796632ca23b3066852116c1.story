It was one of the most star-studded weddings of the year  and since tying the knot to George Clooney in a three-day wedding extravaganza, Amal Alamuddin has secured her status as one of the world's favourite style icons.

And now, one artist has celebrated Mrs Clooney's wardrobe in a rather bizarre way - by immortalising her as a Simpson.  

The Lebanese-born lawyer, who has shot from relative obscurity to most envied woman in the world overnight, wowed with a wedding wardrobe packed with the likes of Oscar de la Renta, Dolce and Gabbana and Prada, which Italian Alexsandro Palombo has captured in a series of illustrations.

Guess who? Amal Alamuddin and George Clooney have been treated to a Simpson makeover by an Italian artist to celebrate their recent wedding

As you know them: AleXsandro Palombo, a contemporary artist, illustrator and activist has 'Simpsonized' the couple to celebrate their wedding, pictured on Hello! magazine's cover last week

The contemporary artist, illustrator and activist has 'Simpsonized' the 36-year-old in a succession of her best-known outfits from the wedding weekend. 

The series includes her stunning selection of designer looks from Alexander McQueen,  Giambattista Valli and Stella McCartney.

And, of course, she can be seen in her bespoke Oscar de la Renta for her marriage to Mr Clooney.  

All white! Amal looked chic in Stella McCartney  tailored, wide-leg trousers and a navy and cream top as she made her union to Mr Clooney official on Monday - and there she is rocking the look as a Simpson, right

Colourful creation: The lawyer wore a beautifully ornate Giambattista Valli Haute Couture minidress for her first appearance as Mrs Clooney on Sunday, which the Italian artist has re-imagined, right

The French lace gown was embroidered with diamante and pearls and featured a circular train, while the wide neckline scooped just off her shoulders. 

He has also included the look she wore the day after her wedding - £450 Stella McCartney tailored, wide-leg trousers and a navy and cream top, both of which were bespoke, of course.  

The day before she wore the weekend's most colourful creation - a Giambattista Valli Haute Couture minidress, which she wore for her first appearance as Mrs Clooney on Sunday, as seen in the quirky illustrations.

At the glamorous pre-wedding dinner, she took a tip from British royalty and wore a custom-made dress by Alexander McQueen, the same designer that the Duchess of Cambridge wore for her actual wedding.

Red hot! For her pre-wedding dinner, Amal wore custom-made Alexander McQueen, which also featured a high-low hemline

The eye-catching scarlet gown, which perfectly complemented Amal's dark hair and eyes, was adapted from a Resort 2011 collection design, which Michelle Obama wore to a state dinner in 2011.

Alexsandro's previous work includes giving the Duchess of Cambridge a similar makeover and also recreating Disney princesses as disabled and as victims of domestic abuse on his blog Humor Chic. 

Speaking about Amal's wardrobe, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Amal is surely now the First Lady of Hollywood? She has got the high-profile hubby, has her own amazing career, will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe.

'She has given us a glimpse of what to expect from her when dressing for occasions in the space of a few days: her monochrome Dolce & Gabbana arrival outfit demonstrates her ultra chic travelling wardrobe, the stand-out red McQueen dress was sexy eveningwear done to perfection, the post-wedding Giambattista Valli couture mini-dress shows how she does short and sassy, and the trouser-and-top combo for their civil ceremony was her answer to chic, well-tailored, classic dressing. 

'Women will want her wardrobe, and they will try to emulate her looks. She's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making, always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her. She wears couture exactly as it's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence.' 

Look who it is! The happy new Mr and Mrs Clooney can be seen in a romantic embrace on a boat named Amore as Homer drives them into the distance
