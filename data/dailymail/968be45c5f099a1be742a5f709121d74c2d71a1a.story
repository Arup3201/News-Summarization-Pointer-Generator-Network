Hundreds of chickens caused chaos on a busy motorway this morning after a lorry crash enabled them to make a bid for freedom.

The live birds spilled on to the eastbound carriageway of the M62 near Eccles Interchange in Greater Manchester when damage to the lorry transporting allowed them to escape their containers.

The accident happened in the early hours of this morning, with all three lanes of the eastbound carriageway and one lane westbound shut between junction 11 and 12 since 4.15am.

Chaos: Hundreds of live birds spilled on to the eastbound carriageway of the M62 near Eccles Interchange in Greater Manchester when severe damage to the lorry transporting allowed the chickens to escape

Escape: A group of men stand among the wreckage of the lorry. Several hundred chickens were able to make a bid for freedom and started wandering along the motorway after the crash

Emergency crews spent hours clearing the area of debris and rounding up all the surviving chickens.

Motorists were initially advised that they still face lengthy delays and were urged to avoid entering the area around the Eccles Interchange if possible.

The motorway has now been cleared and all lanes reopened, with residual delays of less than 10 minutes.

Earlier, as recovery teams sealed off the area, several motorists took to Twitter to discuss the incident.

Dale Solan said: 'Casually driving down the M62, suddenly there are 1000 live chickens in the road. Operation chicken re-coup.'

Mike Walton added: 'Playing chicken on the M62 in rush hour just isn't acceptable.'

Chase: Emergency crews aworked to clear the area of debris from the crash and round up all the chickens that survived. The westbound carriageway has since reopened and traffic is moving freely

Anger: As recovery teams sealed off the area, several motorists took to Twitter to complain about the incident

According to the Highways Agency, the lorry was carrying 6,000 chickens at the time of the crash.

Several hundred were able to escape, with the majority quickly rounded back into their containers.

Vehicles that built up behind the crash were allowed to pass in lane four of the eastbound carriageway before it was shut completely.

From 5am until 2.40pm, drivers were told to take the southbound M6 and eastbound M56 from junction 10 of the M62 at Croft Interchange rather than use the M62.

That instruction has now been lifted.
