A detailed picture of how a teacher and schoolgirl lived while on the run in France has today emerged as he appeared at an extradition hearing.

Jeremy Forrest, 30, appeared before magistrates in Bordeaux, four days after he was arrested on suspicion of child abduction. He will return to Britain after the French court agreed to his extradition.

The married maths teacher from Ringmer, East Sussex, travelled to France with pupil Megan Stammers, 15, on September 20.

The pair checked into one Bordeaux hotel for a night and then spent six nights in another, where they subsisted almost entirely on a diet of takeaway kebabs.

Tight security: Forrest will return to Britain on Thursday after the French court agreed to his extradition

Mario Remi, the owner of a Lebanese 
kebab shop near the Britons' hotel, said: 'They came several times. He 
always took the food away for both of them.'

A European arrest warrant was issued for Forrest after the pair failed to use return ferry tickets on September 23.

Forrest, who this morning appeared in court 
wearing a T-shirt, checked shirt and trousers, confirmed his name and 
nationality before agreeing to return to Britain on Thursday morning.

The decision to extradite him to the UK came as it emerged that a British expat had told police where Forrest and Megan were staying days before they were finally located.

Builder Ian Loveridge, 48, said he tipped off British police last Tuesday after seeing television news coverage about the missing pair and then spotting Megan in a Bordeaux street.

He said: 'I saw a young girl standing at the top of the street and recognised it was Megan straight away mainly because she looked so out of place.

‘Forrest was standing next to the entrance and she gave him a big hug.

‘They then disappeared into the hotel. They both looked very comfortable in each other’s company and clearly wanted to be with each other.'

Accommodation: The pair stayed at the Huguerie Hotel (pictured) for six nights. They are said to have survived on a diet of kebabs during their stay

On their first night in Bordeaux, Forrest and Megan stayed at the two-star Hotel Choiseul (pictured), before moving on to the Huguerie

Fast food: Mario Remi, who runs a Lebanese kebab shop, said the pair dropped by a number of times

But it was two days later before 
French police finally stopped by the Huguerie Hotel - and the owner 
failed to recognise a photo of Megan and so they left empty-handed.

Owner Gerald Agier said Forrest had arrived alone and checked in using the name 'Dean'.

The pair stayed at the Huguerie for six nights. On
their first night in the city, Forrest and Megan stayed at the two-star
Hotel Choiseul, before moving on to the Huguerie Hotel.

Outside court today, Forrest's British 
lawyer, Phil Smith, said: 'Now that he has agreed to be extradited to 
the UK, we look forward to the full story emerging.

'He is very appreciative of the support of his family and concerned about the impact of this on all those concerned.'

Forrest, Megan's teacher at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, was being kept in detention until his removal.

The teenager has already returned to her hometown and been reunited with mother Danielle Wilson and stepfather Martin Stammers.

Appearing
in the dock flanked by a female interpreter and two security guards, 
Forrest was asked if he agreed to return to the UK to explain himself to
the British court authorities, to which he replied 'Yes'.

The 
teacher, who gave his birthplace as Aberdeen, then signed a three-page 
document before the two male and one female magistrates.

Forrest and Megan were spotted in 
Bordeaux by a member of the public who recognised the teacher from 
television coverage as he touted a bogus CV around bars in Bordeaux 
seeking cash-in-hand work.

They had spent eight days apparently dodging police and staying in budget hotels as they planned a new life together.

Since his arrest last week, Forrest has been held in one of the toughest remand centres in south-west France.

He
left Britain with Megan, from Eastbourne, on September 20 when they 
were captured on CCTV arm-in-arm and holding hands on a cross-Channel 
Dover to Calais ferry.

Megan had earlier that afternoon told her mother, Danielle Wilson, that she was going to spend the night at a friend’s house. In fact she was preparing to leave the country, using what is believed to have been a passport belonging to Forrest’s wife, Emily.

Witnesses said Forrest and Megan visited expat bars including one called 
the HMS Victory.They were even seen posing for pictures in the 
historic centre of Bordeaux which Forrest, an amateur musician, had 
first visited in 2009 as a busker.

It later emerged that Forrest had 
been giving Megan extra-curricular maths lessons, and that the pair’s 
closeness during a trip to Los Angeles in February had been reported to 
other teachers at the Bishop Bell School in Eastbourne.

Forrest, who had a tattoo of a young 
girl inked on his arm this summer, was allegedly due to be suspended by 
the school the day before he and Megan left for France.

New allegations: It has emerged that Megan travelled on what is believed to be a passport belonging to Forrest¿s wife, Emily (right, pictured on their wedding day)

East Sussex County Council has confirmed it was ‘addressing and investigating concerns’ about Forrest.

Megan returned to Britain from 
Bordeaux on Saturday, and is now at a secret location as she tries to 
come to terms with her ordeal. She is believed to be hoping to see 
Forrest if – as expected – the Bordeaux court approves a fast track 
extradition order.

Forrest will be released from the 
notoriously tough and overcrowded Gradignan prison, on the outskirts of 
Bordeaux, in the late morning before his appearance before judges.
