Crystal clear water, pristine beaches and the stunning Great Barrier Reef stretching 2,600kms off the coast of Queensland.

The Whitsunday Islands are one of Australia’s greatest tourist attractions with more than 800,000 tourists flocking to the region each year.

To cope with an increasing number of local and American visitors, Virgin Australia has just launched daily flights from Los Angeles direct to Brisbane. 

The Group Executive for Public Affairs at Virgin Danielle Keighery told Daily Mail Australia there is a high demand from customers wanting to get to the Great Barrier Reef from the United States.

‘Having daily flights gives people more options and allows greater flexibility, so I think it’s great  that we can offer that service’

Crystal clear water, palm trees and pristine beaches - it's just another day in paradise at Hayman Island, the most northerly of the Whitsunday Islands 

However the new daily route means changes to the Melbourne and Sydney services. The Melbourne to LA route ceased operation completely on Saturday, while the Sydney to Los Angeles flights now depart at a different time to allow an earlier arrival into the US.

Virgin Australia’s Chief Commercial Officer Judith Crompton says the changes are part of extensive market analysis.

“Those travelling from Melbourne will still be able to travel to Los Angeles on one ticket with through-checked baggage, connecting through Sydney or Brisbane, and we are committed to providing competitive fares on these routes.'

The new Business Class cabins will be rolled out on the three class Boeing 777 aircraft - which fly the Brisbane to LA route – by the end of next year. While Virgin’s fleet of Airbus A330’s will be upgraded in early 2015, with the first aircraft expected to be in service by March.

The futuristic upgrade include more spacious seats on both the A330 and the 777, which convert into luxurious 80 inch lie-flat beds

The futuristic upgrade of the Business Class suites include more spacious seats on both the A330 and the 777, which convert into luxurious 80 inch lie-flat beds and gives passengers three inches more legroom, along with redesigned bars on the Boeing 777 aircraft.

The daily Brisbane to LA route which is on sale now, also features a restaurant quality Business Class menu designed by Luke Mangan, who came on board after a call from Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson.

‘He didn’t have to convince me much, I just knew it was going to be good fun and a challenge’, Luke told Daily Mail Australia.

Fine dining and airline food are not usually mentioned in the same sentence, but that’s exactly what the celebrity chef has managed to achieve.

The new Business class menu wouldn't be out of place in a three hat restaurant and features mouth-watering options such as char-grilled beef fillet, red curry of duck leg and blue eyed fillet.

 Ms Keighrey says people now want fresh foods on flights. ‘The old days of having plane food that was constructed and frozen is thankfully long gone and we now can enjoy fabulous fresh food that is all prepared fresh and passengers can get off the other end feeling good’.

And that's exactly what Luke is trying to achieve.  ‘What I’m trying to do is get restaurant food in the sky and I’ve learnt a lot of tricks along the way, like using fragrant spices to make it clean fresh and full of flavour, because you lose about 20-20 per cent of your tastebuds in the air’.

After dropping out of school at just 15, Mangan now has 12 restaurants to his name, runs Salt grills on three P&O cruises and still manages to teach Virgin staff how to plate up his restaurant quality meals.

‘We prepare a lot of the base and we teach the crew – we get around thirty crew every two months and we do a master class for 2.5 hours and we show them how to plate the dishes up’, Luke told Daily Mail Australia. 

‘All the dishes are tested in airline ovens at Mojo in Sydney and I get to try them and give them the thumbs up!’.

Virgin has not only upgraded their flight schedule, seats and menus, they have also developed a partnership with the newly refurbished One&Only resort on the picture perfect Hayman Island.

The ultra-luxury private island resort recently underwent an $80 million dollar makeover and now Virgin velocity members can earn points when staying at the resort and enjoy special benefits.

One&Only currently has eight luxurious resorts around the world, from the Bahamas and South Africa, to Dubai and the first resort in the Asia Pacific region on Hayman Island - which played host to the cast of Modern Family earlier in the year.

The renovations include an upgrade of almost half of the 160 rooms to suite, villa or penthouse accommodation, all set amongst expansive pools and two kilometres of pristine white sand beaches.

The beach front villas cost around $2000 a night, while the newly renovated Pool Wing features transformed suites with breathtaking views and drop in pool access from the terrace that will set you back up to $1500 a night.

One of the penthouse suites has even been designed by world-acclaimed fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg. Set over 160 square metres it features two bedrooms and two bathrooms plus a butler service and will cost you a mere $6150 a night.

CEO of Kerzner International Development Alan Leibman said they are excited to have introduced the award winning One&Only style to this part of the world.

‘We have completely redefined luxury in the Great Barrier Reef and transformed the guest experience with hallmarks of excellence found in One&Only resorts around the world, whilst capturing the break-taking beauty of one of the natural wonders of the world’.

The partnership between Virgin Australia and One&Only Hayman Island is part of an ongoing commitment by the airline to align themselves with high quality brands.

Ms Keighrey told Daily Mail Australia, ‘It really is one of the most beautiful locations and an extremely popular location for people traveling. One&Only focus on fabulous service and providing a really lovely and seamless experience so we have the commonality there in wanting to deliver above and beyond what our customers want’.

Velocity - the hugely successful frequent flyer program run by the airline – is now valued at close to $1 billion after the sale of a %35 stake to the private equity film Affinity Equity Partners on October 22.

Virgin has maintained a 65 per cent stake with the deal boosting their cash flow by $336 million, as the company prepares to take over budget airline Tigerair Australia.

Research has found Virgin Australia had the highest customer satisfaction levels of all airlines operating between Australia and the United States last year. Something Ms Keighrey says is very important to her team.

‘I’ve got friends who don’t even want to go to sleep on a long haul flight because they want to enjoy the champagne, the entrée, the main, the movies and all those sorts of things. Flying is a great experience and it’s important for us to continue to deliver a great experience’.
