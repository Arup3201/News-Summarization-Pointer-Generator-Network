Jack Wilshere says he will be ready for the start of Premier League season after returning to Arsenal training three days early following the World Cup.

The England midfielder posted a picture of him at training with the hashtag #WilshWillBeReady just days after he was seen appearing to smoke in a swimming pool while partying in Las Vegas.

With the rest of Arsenal's England contingent due back in training on Sunday, Wilshere proved his commitment by arriving back on Thursday.

He posted the picture of him and Walcott with the message, '1st day back was tough, not going to lie! But look who's back in his boots! #TJW #29Days #WilshWillBeReady @theowalcott'.

Walcott is returning to fitness after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during Arsenal's FA Cup third-round victory against Tottenham in January.

The England winger has refused to set a date for his comeback but insists he is pleased with the progress he has made over the summer.

'The knee is going really well, I am doing some good stuff with the physios and fitness coaches and we have worked really hard throughout the summer,' Walcott said,

'Things are looking really good and I have worked very hard for the last five months now.

'The most important thing is getting the strength back and it has pretty much nearly healed - it is just about building up that stability and strength again.

'It is coming along nicely and I am really pleased.'

A fully-fit Wilshere and the imminent return of Walcott is good news for Arsene Wenger, who recently added Chile forward Alexis Sanchez for £30million from Barcelona.

The Gunners have also been linked with a move for Real Madrid and Germany midfielder Sami Khedira.
