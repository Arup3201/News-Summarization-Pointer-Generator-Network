A man has been charged following the murder of a night manager at a Missouri hotel during a  robbery attempt in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Scott Knopfel, 50, was shot in the head at the Drury Inn in St. Louis just before 3 a.m. after he struggled with his assailant while opening a cash drawer.

Joseph Bowens, 43, has been charged with first-degree murder, first-degree robbery and two counts of armed criminal action.

Surveillance video shows Joseph Bowens, whom the manager mistook for a patron, enter the hotel and leave less than 30 seconds later.

He can be seen pulling out a handgun and vaulting a counter, then leaving the hotel in the same manner.

Knopfel was killed by two gunshots, one to the chest and one to the head. Police found him deceased behind the front desk of the hotel when they arrived on the scene. 

Bowens was arrested in the city on Saturday night, reports CBS.

Knopfel's death was one of six homicides in St. Louis during a 12-hour span - an unusually high number for a city which has a population of about 320,000 people and recorded 159 homicides in 2014.

Police Chief Sam Dotson and Mayor Francis Slay have linked the violence to crime increases in the area documented since the fatal Ferguson police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown more than five months ago in north St. Louis County.

'To see this much violence going on in our city within such a short period of time, it is absolutely outrageous,' Slay said. 'It's out of hand. It disgusts me.'
