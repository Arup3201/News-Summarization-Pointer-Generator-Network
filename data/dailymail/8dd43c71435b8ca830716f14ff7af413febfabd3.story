A family of five squatters and their pet dog moved into a luxury $1million home and even organised a party for their neighbors before they were removed, court documents have revealed.

Convicted con artist James Crombie, 47, his wife and their three young children allegedly moved all of their belongings into the four-bedroom house in Bethesda, Maryland, and stayed there for three days. 

It was not until the home's real owners showed and called the police that members of the community realized something was wrong.

Squatters: A family of five moved into this vacant $1million property in Bethesda, Maryland, for three days, authorities have said 

Luxurioys: The property has been on the market for over a year and includes four bedrooms

James Crombie, 47, a convicted con artist is believed to have moved into the home with his wife, their three young children and a dog. He now faces a long list of criminal charges and up to 30 years in prison

Officers then arrived and told the family that they had one day to move out after Crombie failed to provide proof he had legitimately purchased the property.  

The vacant home had been on the market for a year and has two full marble bathrooms and nanny quarters on the main level.

The listing posted by an estate agent says it is fitted with a gourmet kitchen and has a garden patio 'perfect for entertaining'. 

Court documents said that the family badly damaged some of the rooms during their stay.

Stains on the carpets, broken locks and soiled furniture has resulted in a repair bill of $1,000. 

The family are also believed to have moved some of the home's items into a wooden shed in the garden.  

Neighbor Patricia Medeiros told WJLA: 'It was shocking. I can't imagine how you would think you could get away with something like that. Not to mention the ethical issues involved with moving into someone else's home.

Charles Hill added that the lock on the house had been drilled and the family had gone around houses in the neighborhood introducing themselves. They even set up 'entertainment' for the community.

Spacious: The property is fitted with what has been described as a 'gourmet kitchen' with marble work tops 

Con: Crombie and his family had allegedly introduced themselves to neighbors as the owners and had organized 'entertainment' for all of them at their home 

Crombie, a convicted con artist, told officers that he had purchased the house through a consulting firm called The Moore Group - a company he claimed to be a principal member of.

However he had no documents to prove that he was the rightful owner. As a result police officers ordered him to leave by the next day and criminal charges were filed a short time later.  

When the station visited Crombie's home, he did not comment.

He is now facing a long list of charges and will appear in court on January 6 for a status hearing. If convicted he faces up to 30 years in prison.

In November 2013, a federal court in California order Crombie pay $1.5 million for misrepresentations to the National Futures Association and for solicitation fraud. 

According to court documents, Crombie is a former investment professional and was accused of committing a massive fraud related to a quantitatively-based trading program in 2012.

A company he was affiliated with, Paron Capital Management, was accused by the National Futures Association (NFA) of using promotional material that misled clients. 

He had previously lived in California and Connecticut before moving to Maryland.  

Washroom: There are two full bathrooms in the property with a marble bath and enormous shower 

Outdoors: There is also a garden patio with a BBQ  which the estate agent says is 'perfect for entertaining'

Accommodation: On the main level of the home are nanny quarters which come with a full-size bathroom 

Open: Light streams in through the windows into the dining room. According to court documents Crombie told officers that he had bought the property through a company he was a principal member of 

Entrance: A staircase leads down to the double doors at the front of the home. Neighbors said that the lock had been drilled, allowing the family to enter 

Perfect for entertaining: Four chairs are placed around a table in the dining room that looks out over the front lawn and street
