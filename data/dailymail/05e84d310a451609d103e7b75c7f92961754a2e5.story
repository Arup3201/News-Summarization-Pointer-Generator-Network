For most women pregnancy might be tough – but it is also a time of great hope and expectation.

For Marlen von Roth, however, it became a recurring ordeal as she defied doctors’ warnings that her babies could be born with Down’s syndrome.

When the 33-year-old account manager became pregnant with her first two children, she was told both times after routine tests that her babies may have the condition.

But after she refused to undergo invasive further screening due to the risk of miscarriage, Lukas, now five, and two-year-old Sophia were born with no abnormalities. 

Miss von Roth said the routine Down’s tests had ‘ruined’ her pregnancies and urged other women to think seriously before having them. Indeed, when she became pregnant for a third time with daughter Anna, now eight months, she decided not to undergo screening at all.

The initial test, offered to all pregnant women at 12 weeks, measures hormones in the blood. This is assessed along with an ultrasound scan to work out if a baby has a heightened chance of Down’s.

During Miss von Roth’s first pregnancy, she and her managing director husband Paul Freshwater, 41, were told there was a one in 700 likelihood that Lukas had the condition. With Sophia, the chance was one in 24.

For healthy pregnant women in their 20s, the risk of Down’s is usually lower than one in 1,000. Miss von Roth claims each time doctors put her under pressure to have Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS), an invasive further test.

But due to the risk of miscarriage caused by CVS – during which fluid is taken from the umbilical cord for analysis – she refused. Miss von Roth, who lives in Ashtead, Surrey, said: ‘After being given such drastic news – which turned out to be wrong – I spent my whole pregnancies obsessed my children might not be healthy. I couldn’t just relax and enjoy the experience.’

Recalling her pregnancy with Lukas, she said: ‘I was devastated when I got a phone call saying the test showed a higher risk of having a baby with Down’s syndrome.

‘Doctors wanted me to undergo a CVS test, but I refused because by then I’d discovered the risk of miscarriage – around one to two babies in 100 – was higher than my chance of having a baby with Down’s.’

Lukas was born healthy in July 2009. But the nightmare recurred with Sophia two years later. ‘Medical staff were very negative when I refused [a CVS],’ Miss von Roth said. ‘It shocked me how keen they were for me to go in so fast for an invasive test that could have caused a miscarriage, simply so I could be “reassured”.

‘I couldn’t have lived with myself if that had resulted in me losing my precious daughter.’

By the time she became pregnant with Anna, she decided not to have the test. ‘Paul and I felt even if we were having a baby with Down’s we would not terminate the pregnancy,’ she said. ‘I am shocked at the thought that so many women must have further tests to be “reassured” only to lose a healthy baby.’
