The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon - along with the battalion of celebrities that stopped in to help him premiere - managed to conquer Monday night's ratings, with a 7.1 rating in the overnight metered-markets.

That is equal to an audience of 11.3 million viewers.

However the likeable comedian failed to surpass the recent record by by his predecessor, Jay Leno, whose departing show on February 16 managed a mammoth 9.2/22.

That totaled 14.64 million viewers overall in the Nielsen nationals, according to Variety.

Jolly good show: Jimmy Fallon made a strong debut as the new host of The Tonight Show, with an estimated audience of about nine to 10 million people tuning in on Monday night

Jay Leno, seen here during his August 2013 taping with Barack Obama, totalled 14.64 million viewers overall when his final Tonight show went to air on February 16

Fallon had a 3.8 rating among young viewers aged 18-49, a number that surpassed ABC, CBS and Fox last week, reports The New York Times.

Both Leno and Fallon benefited from a huge lead-in from NBC's coverage of the Sochi Winter Olympics.

Fallon still managed to place about 80% higher than the combined overnight Monday rating for the programs hosted by Jimmy Kimmel on ABC and David Letterman on CBS, Variety reported.

His debut was also well up on the 5.4/14 metered-market rating that Leno garnered on March 1, 2010, when he returned to fronting the franchise after brief stint by Conan O'Brien.

The show featured Will Smith, a rooftop performance by U2 and an interview with Bono, was well as a seemingly never-ending string of celebrity cameos, which included Stephen Colbert, Tina Fey, Robert De Niro, Mariah Carey, Kim Kardashian, Sarah Jessica Parker, Joan Rivers, Seth Rogen, Lindsay Lohan, Mike Tyson and Lady Gaga.

It also marked the return of The Tonight Show to New York City, where 
it originated in 1954.

Entertainment Weekly said that Fallon's big test will not necessarily come on his first post-Olympics outing on February, but 'the weeks, months and years to come'.

'It’s a cliche to write that a TV show’s ratings are a marathon not a sprint, but it’s a cliche that’s never more true than when analyzing late-night talk shows,' the TV industry mag said.

In reviewing Fallon's debut, EW depicted him as a loveable goof.

'Time-slot rival Jimmy Kimmel is the inheritor of the Letterman tradition: Too cool for school. Fallon is the guy who thinks school is pretty cool,' the review said.

Variety reported: 'Tonight has been the No. 1-rated latenight program for most of the time it’s been on the air for NBC, from Jack Paar and Johnny Carson through the two stints of Leno. But with the passing of the baton from Leno to Fallon, both ABC (with Kimmel) and CBS (with Letterman) see an opportunity to gain competitive ground.'
