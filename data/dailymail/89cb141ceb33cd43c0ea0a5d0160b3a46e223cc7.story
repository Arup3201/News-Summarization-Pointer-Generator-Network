Amir Khan will be wearing the most outrageously expensive shorts in sporting history on Saturday night but he will be fighting for the priceless yet simple pleasure of his infant daughter growing up proud of his exploits in the ring.

The garb will be garishly in keeping with the Las Vegas Strip. Genuine 24 carat gold thread woven through a waist band supporting white nappa leather trunks with crocodile trim. Estimated cost – take a deep breath - between £20,000 and £30,000.

The sentiment will be touching and homely, with Khan saying: ‘I want our baby to be able to say one day that her father was a great champion.’

The 28-year-old will wear shorts worth an estimated £20,000-£30,000 for the fight with the American

The trunks, made specially for the fight, have genuine 24 carat gold thread woven into the waistband 

The shorts, which will be unveiled when he enters the MGM Grand Garden to face Devon Alexander, are certain to end up on display in a museum or a casino showcase.

The paternal dream of ‘my little girl going to school and her friends saying her dad was a great boxer’ is not yet certain to be fulfilled. That depends on him defeating Alexander in style and then going on to do the same against one of two active icons, Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao.

Khan admits that when, hopefully, tiny Lamaisa’s day comes ‘I will already be retired.’

As it happens, he passed his previously declared date for hanging up the gloves when he reached his 28th birthday this Monday.’

But now he says: ‘I feel better today than when I was 26. Physically and mentally. Healthier and stronger. Still coming to my peak.’

Khan said that to truly have global recognition you have to have success on the other side of the Atlantic

His recently taken wife Faryal and their first-born child provide added motivation to box on: ‘Everything I do from here is for them.’

Part of Khan’s charm is that he is something of a paradox, without knowing it.

He compares what he regards as a moderate life-style with the lavish excesses of Mayweather in this, his home town, saying: ‘Floyd has to earn big because he spends so much. I don’t splash out on things like he does. I don’t need to make billions, just enough to keep my family and give my daughter an education. I’m not a big spender.’

Yet he has a liking for fast cars…and then there are those golden trunks.

The shorts may be supplied as a promotional tool for a company called Fight Label but they do not indicate restraint.

Yet he is understated in his rebuttal of claims by master trainer Freddie Roach that Pacquiao used to deck him in the gym when they trained together.

The Briton doesn't seem to have indulged in any birthday cake on Tuesday, when he turned 28

Khan beat American Luis Collazo in his last fight, which was also in Las Vegas, back in May this year

Khan insisted that everything he does and earns now is for the benefit of his wife, Faryal, and his daughter

Khan and Fayral got married in 2013 in the US and the couple had their first child, Lamaisah, in May this year

Khan says: ‘No way Manny outclassed me in sparring. Perhaps I should send Freddie some videos to remind him of that. But I don’t want to get into an argument about whether Manny knocked me down.

‘Perhaps Freddie said it because he was hurt that I left him for Virgil Hunter – who everyone says is making me a better fighter – but I want there to be respect when I meet him and Manny somewhere down the road.’

The Bolton boy is growing up, yet there is still something of the teenager in him when he gets wide-eyed at seeing his name up in huge lights on the Strip and as excited as a schoolboy at the prospect of topping the bill at the MGM for the first time.

He has made that possible by relocating his fights to the other side of the Atlantic and building a fan base in America. He says: ‘I hope this will encourage young British fighters to take that risk. I could have earned more in England and there is a risk that you get beat and you come home to find the millions are no longer there.

Khan refuted claims made by Freddie Roach that he had been knocked out by Manny Pacquiao while sparring

Khan talks to journalists, including Sportsmail's Jeff Powell, ahead of his upcoming fight

Khan said that he, unlike Floyd Mayweather, lived a modest lifestyle and didn't need to earn too much money 

‘But if you want global recognition you have to fight in America.’

Khan recalled that Prince Naseem Hamed blazed that trail and is now to be installed in the boxing Hall of Fame, even though he lost over here his biggest fight to Marco Antonio Barrera.

He says: ‘Naz made his name in the US. That’s one reason why I sent him a message congratulating him on the honour.’

Apparently, Khan Is the only current British ring star to have taken that trouble and he doubts he will hear from many, if any, if he lands his super-fight with Mayweather – and then becomes the first to beat him.

Yet he says: ‘I won’t be bitter if that’s the case. It will probably just be jealousy.’

If he does overthrow the pound-for-pound king he will probably be right. As would his daughter when telling everyone that her dad was the greatest.

Khan v Alexander will be live on Sky Sports late Saturday night.
