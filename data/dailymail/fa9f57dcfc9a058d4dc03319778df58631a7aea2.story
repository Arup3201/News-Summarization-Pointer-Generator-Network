Everton and Burnley are tracking Rangers midfielder Lewis Macleod as they weigh up possible bids in the January transfer window.

The Barclays Premier League clubs have both paid close attention to Macleod’s progress at Ibrox this season – which led this month to a Scotland call-up - and view him as a player with the potential to develop further south of the border.

Goodison manager Roberto Martinez has enjoyed success recruiting from the Scottish scene in the past, signing James McCarthy and James McArthur from Hamilton during his time at Wigan. McCarthy followed him to Everton in a £12million deal while McArthur has since moved to Crystal Palace for £7m.

It’s understood the Merseyside club would look upon Macleod as one for the future should they decide to push ahead with a bid when the transfer window opens in the New Year.

Burnley have also received glowing reports on the 20-year-old and could seek to lure him south to bolster their battle against the drop.

Manager Sean Dyche has relied on UK talent after winning promotion from the Championship and already has former Falkirk midfielder Scott Arfield on his books. Back-to-back wins have recently lifted the Turf Moor outfit off the foot of the table and generated fresh hope of another season among the elite.

Macleod signed a five-year contract with Rangers in 2012, but the perilous financial situation at Ibrox could leave them vulnerable should offers be forthcoming.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has loaned the club £3m to plug the gap in the short-term, but it is not yet clear where the necessary fresh funding will come from at the end of the year.

Ibrox manager Ally McCoist would be anxious to try to retain the star graduate of the club’s youth system, especially as Rangers now trail Hearts by nine points in the Championship standings after Saturday’s 2-0 defeat at Tynecastle.

Speaking earlier this month about potential interest in Macleod, however, McCoist admitted the money-men would have the final say.

‘Lewis is playing every week, enjoying his football and he is clearly developing and it goes without saying we want that to continue,’ he said.

‘I will be dictated to by the board and people who make decisions but certainly from a footballing point he is doing absolutely smashing and he is a key member of our squad.’

Meanwhile, Hearts defender Kevin McHattie is out until the new year after scans confirmed he had suffered a tear of his knee medial ligaments following Kenny Miller’s robust challenge in the weekend win over Rangers.

The 21-year-old had been bracing himself for three months on the sidelines after being stretchered off in the 49th minute of Saturday’s 2-0 victory.

But boss Robbie Neilson admitted the prognosis could have been a lot worse and revealed the left-back will be out of action for nearer six weeks. ‘It is not good news but it is better than we had feared,’ he said. ‘We knew it was quite a bad one. No surgery is required, though, with rest being needed. He will be in a brace to begin with and will be missing for six weeks.’

Rangers striker Miller, who had already been booked, escaped further punishment from referee Craig Thomson.

But the former Scotland star was immediately substituted by McCoist with the Ibrox side already a man down following Stevie Smith’s first-half red card for a reckless tackle on Callum Paterson.
