Two rogue trader garage bosses have been forced to pay thousands of pounds to customers who were billed for work that was never carried out.

Mark Drury and Stuart Phillips, of Car and Van Grimsby Limited, gave motorists inflated invoices for repairs to their cars which were unnecessary and in some cases were not even done.

The pair have now been banned from running a company for 10 years, and ordered to repay their ill-gotten gains after they admitted 'misleading commercial practices containing false information'.

Prosecutor Kevin Ross told Grimsby Magistrates' Court yesterday that three customers were wrongly charged £1,550, £1,350 and £505 respectively.

In each of the cases, mechanics had told their customers that they needed to repair or replace their gearbox, but never actually did so.

They also charged for repairs to brakes, oil and other car parts which were not carried out.

The company was sentenced to £15,000 in fines, and told to pay nearly £2,400 in compensation for the bogus invoices.

Judge Daniel Curtis told Drury and Phillips: 'Both of you conducted yourselves as company directors with a complete disregard, a blatant disregard, for the trust that hard-working, decent people put in your company to have their vehicles repaired.

'Not only did you provide invoices that were false, you took money from those people, in a way that caused them considerable distress and upset.

'If it had not been for them being sharp and noticing what had not occurred to their vehicles, you would probably have got away with this. I suspect you probably got away with a lot more than is before me.'

Phillips, who apparently ran the business, claimed he was not involved in the bogus repairs and did not know what was going on.

John Radley, 74, was told he needed a new gearbox even though his car showed no sign of having a problem with its gears.

'He told me a needed a new gearbox and charged me for one,' he said after the case. 'I suspected it had not been done. I had a good look inside, underneath and on top. In my mind, he hadn't changed the gearbox.

'Trading standards got an automotive assessor to come and look at my car. They saw the clutch had been changed but, in their opinion, it didn't need replacing. They agreed that the gearbox had not been changed and neither had the flywheel.'

A 67-year-old woman, who asked not to be named, said Phillips told her after her vehicle was taken for an MOT: 'It's really bad. It's going to cost £1,600.'

She added: 'My husband went grey when he heard about the bill. I thought he was going to collapse. All it failed its MOT on was a bad tyre.

'We knew then we had been done over so we went straight to trading standards. They said they had already got him in their sights.

'I can't think why he could do something like that to people. He could see we weren't young. Would he do it to his own parents?'

After the hearing, a spokesman for North East Lincolnshire Council said: 'Our trading standards team investigated after receiving a number of complaints about how the pair had misled customers by charging for motor repairs that had not been carried out.'

The company is no longer trading and Phillips has stopped working in the garage business.
