A bus driver was sucked from the vehicle's window when he crashed into a truck - after reversing down a motorway because he missed a turning.

The horrific smash killed the truck driver, flung ten people from the bus and injured 23.

A CCTV video from inside the bus captured the scene, which shows the bus driver reversing back down the motorway outside Jinhua, south of Shanghai.

The bus is hit by a truck, flinging the passengers and drivers around the vehicle

More than 20 people were injured in the crash, which happened after the driver missed his turn off

The driver can be seen edging back when he is hit at speed by a truck, flinging him and passengers into the air.

The force of the collision shatters the windows and pushes the bus into a roll, causing debris and luggage to fly around as the passengers and driver tumble around. 

The driver appears to be 'sucked' from a side window on the bus, which reportedly slid 50m before eventually shuddering to a halt, NineMSN reported.

The video appears to show the passengers not wearing seatbelts before the smash, and peering out of the window as the vehicle reverses up the road, according to LiveLeak.

The driver slowly manoeuvres the vehicle back to try and reach the exit.

Emergency services closed the Fu Ling exchange after the crash, prompting huge traffic delays.

The horrific crash came days after a Chinese woman miraculously survived a collision which saw her head smash through the windscreen and become wedged in the hole.

The unnamed woman was a passenger in the car when it hit the back of a truck in southern China's Guanxi province.

The force caused the woman, who wasn't wearing a seat belt at the time, to fly forward into the windscreen.

Her head broke the glass and she became wedged in the hole.

When fire crews arrived on the scene, they had to remove the car's unconscious driver from the car before they could painstakingly begin freeing the woman.

Miraculously, both the woman and her male companion are said to be making a full recovery in hospital.
