Hitmen from the Italian mafia are the prime suspects in the gangland-style shooting of the head of one of Monaco's richest families.

Hélène Pastor and her driver are fighting for their lives after they were shot in the face as they left L'Archet hospital in Nice.

Investigators suspect two of Italy's most notorious crime syndicates, the 'Ndrangheta and the Camorra, could be inolved. Both are said to have been building big property portfolios on the French Riviera.

Forensic experts investigate the car in which Helene Pastor was critically injured on May 6

It is believed Mrs Pastor has been visiting her son in hospital before the shooting happened

Mrs Pastor's family have hugely 
valuable property holdings in the area. The implication is that mafia 
dons ordered the shooting in an effort to muscle in on the Pastor 
family's empire.

The gunman 
reportedly approached Mrs Pastor and her chauffeur as they left L'Archet
 hospital after paying a visit to her son, Gildo, on Tuesday evening.

He
 shot both in the face and neck with a pump-action shotgun before 
jumping into a waiting getaway car and speeding off, according to local 
media.

A witness told Le 
Parisien newspaper: 'I saw the gunman turn back towards me with his big 
gun and a bag. I thought he was coming for me. I was terrified for my 
life.'

Mrs Pastor and the 
chauffeur, named today in French press as Mohammed D, were taken to 
Nice's Saint Roch hospital where they are said to be fighting for their 
lives.

Surgeons have operated on both to treat wounds to the face, neck and abdomen.

The
 head of the hospital's intensive care unit told the Telegraph 
yesterday: 'The lives of these two patients remain in danger and their 
prospects are uncertain.'

Witnesses said the gunman used a large pump-action shotgun in the suspected 'hit'

Reports suggest Mrs Pastor's driver may have been the main target of the shooting

Eric
 Ciotti, a French MP, has expressed his shock at the attack and Prince 
Albert II of Monaco issued a statement expressing 'deep support' for the
 Pastor family.

Mrs Pastor's
 family have built up a hugely valuable property portfolio on the French
 Riviera which is said to be worth billions, although its exact value is
 a closely guarded secret.

Rumours that police are investigation Italy's feared mafia crime syndicates were reported today in French daily Le Figaro

Police
 had previously said they believe her driver may have been the main 
target of the attack and she was accidental 'collateral'.
