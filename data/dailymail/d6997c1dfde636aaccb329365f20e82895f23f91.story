The chief of staff to Congressman Steve Stivers, a Republican from Ohio, was forced to resign after an adult film star tweeted a photo of the aide's genitals to his boss.

Adam Kuhn on Tuesday submitted a letter of resignation to Stivers, and the congressman accepted it, according to his spokesperson.

Kuhn, who is single, released a statement to Politico apologizing for his actions.

Hell hath no fury: Allbaugh, who goes by the stage name Ruby, fired off this angry tweet the day she shared her former lover's intimate photos online

‘Over the weekend, I was the victim of an attack on Twitter from a woman I had a relationship with in my personal life,’ Kuhn told Politico. ‘I realize and apologize I had used poor judgement in my personal life regarding this relationship. The woman who posted this has reached out to me to apologize.’

The woman at the center of the scandal has been named as Jennifer Roubenes Allbaugh, a former porn actress who is married with two children.

Allbaugh, who goes by the stage name 'Ruby,' reportedly sent at least one image depicting Adam Kuhn's privates to Congressman Stiver's Twitter page last week as payback for a bad breakup.

According to the veteran adult film star, Kuhn had dumped her and she was out for 'revenge.'

On Saturday, Allbaugh tweeted: 'I hate you, AJK, you selfish pompous a**hole. Now we're even.'

The woman was later forced to take down the X-rated photo of Kuhn's genitals after he obtained a cease-and-desist order against her.

Her Twitter account has since been deleted.

Allbaugh told Politico that she was a disgruntled former girlfriend who was trying to make Kuhn hate her after their spit, even though she was in love with him and her husband at the same time.

On her Facebook page, the woman wrote that she was a Hall of Fame adult star with 500 films under her belt and the proud recipient of the Golden G String Award in 2007.

Several years ago, Allbaugh retired from the porn industry after 11 years to raise her children; she has described herself as 'a full time MILF.'

Adam Kuhn has been a part of Steve Stivers' team since at least 2010. He was promoted to chief of staff last year, earning an annual salary of $130,000.

While Kuhn's future in politics is uncertain, his ex-girlfriend has lofty aspirations ranging from becoming a madame to running for a public office.  

Lofty aspirations: Allbaugh retired from pornography to raise her children after starring in some 500 films and being inducted into the adult industry's Hall of Fame, but now she may be eying a career in politics

In an excerpt from Marc Copage's documentary Adult Star Chronicles, the adult performer revealed that she loves politics.

'I will run for office someday,' she declared before adding, 'when I'm old and non-threatening.'

Earlier in the interview recorded last year, Allbaugh spoke out in favor of legalizing prostitution in California.

'I will own the first legal brothel in California, you can mark my words,' she vowed.
