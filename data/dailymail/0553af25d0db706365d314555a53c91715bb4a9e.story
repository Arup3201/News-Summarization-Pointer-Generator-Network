In court: Geoffrey Butler, 54, was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment of his German neighbours

A teacher who harassed his neighbours by loudly playing the Dambusters theme and wartime Vera Lynn songs has been handed a court order banning him from being nasty to Germans.

Geoffrey Butler subjected Reinhard and Kathryn Wendt – who moved here from Germany in 1999 – to four years of ‘hell’ by playing the music, whistling patriotic tunes and talking loudly about Nazis while pretending to be on his phone in the garden.

The 54-year-old had denied the hate campaign, but was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment by magistrates yesterday. He avoided being sent to jail only after the Wendts pleaded for leniency.

Instead, magistrates imposed a three-year conditional discharge and ordered Butler to pay the £1,800 court costs.

The maths teacher – who is now unemployed and on benefits – was also given a restraining order which requires him not to use gestures or language which might be considered offensive to German people.

He is barred from playing loud music and making abusive comments and will be hauled back before the courts if he breaks the terms of the orders.

The neighbours’ relationship soured shortly after the German couple moved to the riverside village of Lower Upnor, Kent, in 2007. It involved a dispute over the ownership of a tiny strip of land next to their homes.

Mr Wendt accused Butler of whistling 
the war tunes and regularly playing them from his car stereo. He also 
told the court he had recorded the teacher playing one of Winston 
Churchill’s wartime speeches.

The 62-year-old claimed the harassment was ‘like waterboarding’.

Events
came to a head last  April when the Wendts claimed they were sitting in
bed and saw  Butler taking a picture of them through the window.

The
teacher, whose family members served in the RAF including one in the 
617 ‘Dambusters’ squadron, was arrested the following month.

At
an earlier hearing, Mrs Wendt, also 62, tearfully told the court: ‘I 
just want to live a peaceful life. I haven’t looked for any trouble.’ 

In his evidence yesterday, Butler claimed he had been called names and wrestled to the ground by Mr Wendt.

The German ‘charged’ at him with a garden chair shouting ‘get off my land, big head’, he claimed.

But
giving the verdict at Medway Magistrates Court, chairman of the bench 
Colin Smith said: ‘We find Mr and Mrs Wendt to be compelling, credible 
and consistent witnesses.

‘We find Butler’s evidence to be evasive and contradictory, both in court and in police interview.’

He said the magistrates believed the harassment was directed towards Mr Wendt because he is German.

Sentencing,
Mr Smith said the offence would usually require a period of custody to 
allow reports to be prepared but he would make allowances because the 
Wendts requested leniency.

Butler said he would appeal against the verdict.

After
the case, Mr Wendt said: ‘The last five years have been difficult for 
us. You can’t really describe it. I don’t think people understand. You 
can’t move freely around the house without getting attacked verbally. 
It’s just very difficult living like that.

‘It’s been hell. It’s really been awful. We’ve been having nightmares and not sleeping.

‘We are happy with the outcome but I’m still frightened of him because he still lives there. We are sure that we will move now.’
