Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez were in the thick of it as Arsenal's squad trained ahead of their crucial Champions League play-off against Turkish side Besiktas.

Arsene Wenger's men drew 0-0 in Istanbul - the first time they have failed to win a Champions League play-off match.

The FA Cup winners recovered from going 2-0 against Everton on Saturday to draw 2-2 and the players may be required to perform similar heroics on Wednesday night if they are to avoid playing in the Europa League.

Kick on: Arsenal have appeared to lack a little fluidity in the league, leading to disappointing performances

The Arsenal boss had hinted he would be prepared to sign further players but that may depend on their inclusion in Europe's most lucrative competition.

Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho has been consistently linked to the Gunners throughout the summer but Arsenal may be reluctant to spend more without first guaranteeing their participation in the Champions League proper.

And they will have to do this without the suspended Aaron Ramsey and the injured Olivier Giroud and Yaya Sanogo, which leaves them light up front. 

However, they will still be confident of seeing off Besiktas, considering they have home advantage and the likes of Sanchez and Ozil.
