One of the Utah Boy Scout leaders who was filmed toppling 170million-year-old rock formations at a state park claims his uncle was killed by falling rocks and he knocked over the monuments because he feared they would fall and hurt someone.

David Hall says he and Glenn Taylor found the formations to be dangerously unstable and dangerously near hiking trails at Goblin Valley State Park in central Utah.

Park rangers, though, are unmoved by Hall's story. They say that if the two men believed there was a danger, they should have alerted the proper authorities instead of destroying a geological wonder.

Hall's aunt told the Salt Lake Tribune that Hall was greatly effected by the sudden death of his uncle Michael Astel in 1982.

Debra Woolley tells the newspaper that her late husband was hiking in Colorado with friends when a boulder suddenly came loose and tumbled onto the trail where he was hiking. He was crushed.

'I’m probably a little bit more paranoid about what a loose rock can do,' Hall said.

Rangers are still investigating the case against Hall and Taylor over the October 11 incident. One stumbling block: Putting a price tag on the rock formations that they knocked over. 

However, state officials believe that 
once they have determined the value of the damage, they will hand the 
investigation over to prosecutors to pursue charges.

Last month, the Utah chapter of the Boy Scouts of America that sponsors Hall and Taylor removed them both as leaders.

'We encourage all leaders and Scouts 
to review the "Leave No Trace" principles, as we are all a part of 
maintaining the integrity, character and the natural beauty of the 
outdoors for all living things,' the statement said.

The rock formation they toppled over 
is about 170 million years old, Utah State Parks spokesman Eugene 
Swalberg said. The central Utah park is dotted with thousands of the 
eerie, mushroom-shaped sandstone formations.

Proud: The men said they were 'saving lives' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child

Hall and Taylor came under fire last month after posting a video on Facebook where Taylor can be seen wedging 
himself between a formation and a boulder to knock a large rock off the 
formation's top. Taylor and his two companions can then be seen 
cheering, high-fiving and dancing.

They said the rock formation was 
loose and they feared it was dangerous. They were leading a group of 
teenage Boy Scouts on a trip when it happened.

Hall said they found out about losing
their Boy Scouts positions Monday morning. They had been troop leaders 
for a few years, Hall said, and hope to continue to be involved in 
organization in the future using what happened as a teaching point. Both
men are from Highland, Utah, about 30 miles south of Salt Lake City.

'We've always supported the Boy Scouts and if that's what they feel is best, we support that decision,' Hall said.

'We're extremely sorry for our mistake. We look forward to doing everything we can to make it right and move on.
