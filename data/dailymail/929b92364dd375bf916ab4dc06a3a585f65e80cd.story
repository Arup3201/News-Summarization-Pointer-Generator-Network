Charged: Brenda Nicholas (pictured) allegedly duped a depressed pensioner out of $1million after claiming she could lift her 'grey aura' with a 'special soap'

A palm reader has been accused of swindling more than $1million from an elderly woman after allegedly telling her victim she needed help lifting a 'grey aura about her'.

Brenda Nicholas, 46, has been charged with nearly 50 counts of first-degree theft from the 85-year-old Seattle pensioner over a two-year period.

Police say Nicholas, who had been using the name Monica Marks, met the victim while working at the Chinatown street fair in 2007.

Feeling alone and depressed, the woman agreed to pay Nicholas for a palm reading, where she was allegedly told she needed help to sort out her life, it was reported on www.seattlepi.com.

Nicholas convinced the victim she could help, but at a steep price, according to court documents.

She bought the victim what she referred to as a 'special soap' which she claimed would wash away her grey aura.

She said it was made by a man called Father Thomas who could see the past, present and future.

Nicholas also gave the elderly woman a mystery pill each time she visited intended to make her feel better, but the victim said they made her feel like she was in a 'fog'.

The woman ended up making cash withdrawals ranging from $1,000 to $9,900 up to four times a week until she became broke in February 2011, police said.

Accused: Nicholas met her alleged victim while working at a fair and before long had her withdrawing thousands of pounds each week for her services, according to court documents (file picture)

In total, Nicholas is accused manipulating the woman out of $1,088,500.

According to prosecutors, Nicholas has prior convictions for theft, embezzlement and grand theft auto in California.

She is also facing theft and unlawful possession of a firearm charges connected to several other local cases.

She is currently in King County Jail on $500,000 bail.

Two of her associates, Gilda Ivonne Ramirez and Charles Wayne Jungbluth, are also facing multiple theft charges.
