Once, fashion was all about finding your own style. These days it’s more about copying someone else’s.

Our growing desire to imitate outfits worn by everyone from Hollywood stars to the Duchess of Cambridge has fuelled a 38 per cent increase in global sales at ASOS, Britain’s biggest specialist fashion website.

The 13-year-old company, originally called As Seen On Screen, rang up sales of £335.7million in the four months to the end of last year with cut-price versions of celebrities’ designer outfits.

Success: Online retailer ASOS has posted a huge jump in sales in the run-up to Christmas after a steady rise in retail sales every year over the last decade

Its best sellers were party dresses, 
oversized coats and Christmas jumpers, while publicity from fashion 
leaders such as Samantha Cameron, who wore a £42 ASOS pencil dress to 
the Conservative Party Conference in October, helped other lines fly off
 its virtual shelves.

The
 figures cap an outstanding year for the firm. Its shares have soared by
 157 per cent in the last 12 months, giving it a market value of 
£5.34billion – the equivalent of five Debenhams and only £2.3billion 
less than 130-year-old Marks & Spencer, which is the UK’s biggest 
clothing retailer.

ASOS’s 
international websites, which operate in the US, France, Germany, Spain,
 Russia, Italy, Australia and China, have also contributed to its 
success.

Europe was the 
star performer in the four months to December 31, with sales rising 69 
per cent, while revenues increased 28 per cent in the US and 19 per cent
 elsewhere in the world.

'Retail sales in the UK were particularly strong.’

ASOS’s
 performance provides a further sign that the festive season was a 
stellar one for online retailers, as well as those with a strong 
internet presence, while bricks and mortar shops lagged behind.

British
 Retail Consortium figures show there were 3.7 per cent fewer shoppers 
in the high street in December compared with the same month last year.

ASOS, founded in 2000 by former 
advertising executive Nick Robertson, the current CEO, has been the big 
success story in British retailing in recent years, with its 
fast-changing fashions snapped up by internet-savvy twentysomethings and
 attracting fans including United States First Lady Michelle Obama and 
singer Rita Ora.

The company blamed a vicious high 
street price war and an unseasonably warm October as like-for-like 
fashion sales fell 2.1 per cent year on year for the 13 weeks to 
December 28.

A spokesman from Marks & Spencer said
 it would never comment on a third party retailer, but added that the 
company's online sales figures had gone up by 22.7per cent in the 
quarter leading up to Christmas.

Rising star: ASOS, whose shares have nearly trebled over the last year, said today that its retail sales rose 38per cent to £335.7 million in the four months to December 31 - the first four months of its 2013-14 fiscal year

Debenhams 
has also struggled in recent years, with 2014 set to mark the fourth 
year of consecutive earnings decline, from £174million in 2010 to 
£95million this year, as it has shifted into goods with lower profit 
margins.

Debenhams has 
blamed tough price competition and disappointing online business for 
underlying sales growth of just 0.1 per cent over Christmas.

ASOS's hike in profits compares with a rise of 47per cent in the fourth quarter of the 2012-13 year and analysts' 
consensus forecast for growth of 36per cent, putting it firmly among the sector's major winners in the key festive trading season.

High praise: The firm has attracted fans including United States First Lady Michelle Obama, who wore a red and white ASOS dress while hitting the campaign trail with her husband in 2012

The firm said it had 7.9 million active customers as of December 31, a 41per cent year-on-year rise.

ASOS's
 UK sales jumped 37per cent to £133.7million, with international sales 
up 38per cent to 202 million pounds, with sales in Europe particularly 
strong with growth of 69 percent.

ASOS said retail gross margin rose 90 basis points year-on-year in the period, reflecting tighter stock control.

'These results were driven by significant
 improvements to our customer proposition, including better delivery 
options, additional payment methods and the roll out of our premier 
service in key international markets,' said Mr Robertson.

Shares in ASOS closed Monday at 6,860p.

Dan
 Wagner, Founder and CEO of Powa Technologies said that ASOS's success 
was down to their engagement and interaction with customers - many of 
whom are young women - and warned that other retailers should follow 
suit, or face the consequences.

Founded in 2000 by former advertising executive Nick Robertson, ASOS originally started life as As Seen On Screen - selling versions of outfits spotted on celebrities.

In 2004 the company launched its first own brand, ASOS Women, which has been worn by celebrities including Michelle Obama, Rita Ora and Rhianna.

As well as clothing for men and women, ASOS also offers maternity wear, childrens' clothes, jewellery and beauty products - making it a one-stop shop for customers.

In 2006 the company's only warehouse was damaged in a fuel explosion, but the firm quickly bounced back and continued to grow.

In 2012 ASOS.com became the most visited fashion website in the world, per day 18-34 year olds.

ASOS now boasts websites in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian and Chinese, as well as offices in France, Australia, Germany, the US and London.

The firm allows shoppers to interact with the brand via Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, and also produces its own magazine.

The website also boasts a 'Marketplace', selling items by lesser-known and independent designers while iPad and iPhone apps make it easier for shoppers to get their fashion fix while on the go.

'Retailers are waking up to the fact 
that they need to personally engage with their customers, tailoring the 
shopping experience to the individual and delivering across a multitude 
of different channels,' he said.

'ASOS's’
 trading statement figures put them firmly with the festive season 
"winners" after doing exceptionally well and becoming one of the biggest
 retail successes this year.

'It’s this shift in consumer buying 
patterns that has emphasised the importance of bringing the customer a 
real-time experience – "Real-time" being the buzzword of 2014. And the 
high streets approach to customer interaction and engagement is going to
 have to change if they want to see the year out.

'Technology
 is drastically changing the retail landscape as well as what customers 
expect from their shopping experience. Bluetooth beacons have become the
 latest trend in delivering real-time deals to customers walking through
 their shop doors.

'It’s technology like this that’s allowing the high 
streets to keep up with online giants such as ASOS, bringing instant, 
accurate gratification to customers.

'Everyone’s
 talking about Click-and-Collect and online shopping, but I think what 
will be really interesting this year, is what the high street retailers 
do to bring back customer engagement to the shop floor and compete with 
the likes of ASOS.'

ASOS's 
performance provides a further sign that the Christmas season was a 
stellar one for online retailers and those with a strong internet 
presence.

Figures from the British Retail 
Consortium (BRC) last week showed web sales grew at the fastest pace for
 more than three years in December, up 19.2per cent, with sparkling 
performances from chains such as John Lewis and Next fuelled by online 
trade.

Freddie George, retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said trading at ASOS was 'impressive, but broadly in line with market expectations'.

Europe was the star performer for ASOS in the four month period, with sales rising by 69per cent, while revenues increased 28per cent in the US and 19per cent elsewhere internationally.

It recently launched in China, marking its eighth local language site outside the UK.

'We believe the company will focus on a limited number of markets with a view to making them as significant as the UK rather than taking a scatter gun approach to global expansion,' said Mr George.
