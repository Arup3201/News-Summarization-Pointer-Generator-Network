They say a bird in hand is worth two in the bush.

But not for the rangers on one Britain's most rugged group of islands who have just started a once in every five year puffin count.

Come rain or shine, the 10 intrepid inhabitants of the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast will spend the next three months braving nips and bites as they stick their bare arms down 80,000 burrows to check for inhabitants.

The rangers put their hands down each burrow on the islands to find out the exact numbers of breeding pairs

Hands off! National Trust rangers Will Scott and Samantha Morgan laugh as they put their hands into Puffin nests

After years of growing numbers at the colony - one of the largest in Britain - the 2008 survey found the puffin population had plummeted by a third

As the birds mate for life and 
faithfully return the same underground den year after year, any signs of
occupancy - including an egg, newly-laid bedding, or fresh guano - adds
two more to the rangers' tally.

But
inevitably there are occasions when the owners are home, and then it is
not uncommon for blood to be drawn as the rangers' come off worse in 
their exchange with the puffins' sharp bills.

After
years of growing numbers at the colony - one of the largest in Britain -
the 2008 survey found the puffin population had plummeted by a third 
compared to the previous census, from 56,500 to 36,500 breeding pairs.

The count takes place every five years and dates back to 1939. The sudden decline in puffin numbers has baffled bird lovers

National Trust rangers Will Scott, David Kinchin Smith, Samantha Morgan and Laura Shearer dig deep for evidence. Any signs of occupancy - including an egg, newly-laid bedding, or fresh guano - adds two more to the rangers' tally

Inevitably there are occasions when the owners are home, and then it is not uncommon for blood to be drawn as the rangers' come off worse in their exchange with the puffins' sharp bills

Numbers had dropped from 56,500 to 36,500 breeding pairs - so rangers are keen to find any evidence that numbers have increased

The sudden decline baffled bird lovers, with some blaming overfishing of the North Sea or pollution from oil and plastics.

Others feared that changing climate could be driving them away.

On four of the eight Farne Islands there was a dramatic decrease of up to 50 per cent.

In recent years, the signs were that numbers had begun to steadily creep back up.

National Trust rangers will carry out a puffin census on the Farne Islands which offer good protection for the birds to nest

The Farne Islands provide excellent sources of food and few ground predators but despite this rangers fear that the extreme winter could impact on breeding numbers

A census is carried out every five years with the last one in 2008 recording 36,500 pairs of puffins

But wardens now fear any gains will be wiped out by the worst puffin 'wreck' for more than 60 years, which occurred in March.

Around 3,000 dead birds washed up on the north-east coast, amongst them one of the colonies oldest puffins, a 31-year-old male.

David Steel, head warden of the National Trust-owned Farne Islands, said: 'We had seen some small increases in the past few years, so we were optimistic that numbers would be up.

With 80,000 burrows needing to be checked by hand, the team will likely have lost of scars to show for their hard work

In recent months dozens of puffins have been washed up along the North Sea coast after succumbing to extreme weather conditions

'But with the recent extreme weather, 
and the puffin 'wreck' claiming thousands of birds there will inevitably
be knock-on, so we will just have to wait and see.

'The count can be both the best and worst of the job. It's great fun, but with 80,000 burrows needing to be checked by hand, the team will likely be sick of them by the end of the count, and have lost of scars to show for it.'

The rangers are also hoping to re-introduce rabbits to the isles this summer, to graze the meadows where many species of bird make their nest - including eider ducks, razorbills and terns.

Although rabbits like to burrow, they do not compete with the puffins, who will chase them out of their nests.

For fans of the colourful little seabirds who are unable to make the journey to wild and windy Farnes, the National Trust have installed a camera in one of the burrows, showing the day to day activities of a pair of birds and their newly-hatched egg.

They also have a 'puffin-cam' on the island, which has been placed amongst the birds to capture up close footage.
