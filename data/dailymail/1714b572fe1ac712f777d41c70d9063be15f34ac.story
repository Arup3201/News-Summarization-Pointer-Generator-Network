A never-seen-before diary purportedly belonging to the woman who claims she had underage sex with Prince Andrew reveals explicit claims of the alleged night they slept together in London.

Virginia Roberts, now 30, claims that she had sex with the prince when she was 17 and a 'sex slave' to his billionaire friend Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile.

In the 24-page diary, obtained by Radar Online, Roberts details the night they allegedly met as well as graphic details of their sexual encounter.

Roberts, who had told her parents she was being trained as a masseuse, says she was taken shopping by Maxwell for expensive clothes, before meeting the Duke of York at the private townhouse

Roberts writes the group went to private, members-only nightclub Tramp in central London where she claims Prince Andrew grabbed them both an 'alcoholic cocktail'. She adds: 'He was the most incredibly hideous dancer I had ever seen'

She claims Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 2001 - they flew to Paris, then Spain, then Tangier and finally, they went to London.

She alleges the first time she met the prince was at the home of Epstein's friend Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, in the city.

Roberts, who had told her parents she was being trained as a masseuse, says she was taken shopping by Maxwell for expensive clothes, before meeting the Duke of York at the private townhouse. 

She writes how they stayed at the club for just over an hour, but she could he wanted to move on by the way he was 'fondling me on the dance floor, I knew that was a man's polite way of saying he wanted to intimately get acquainted'

Roberts, now a mother-of-three, says the pair returned to Maxwell's house.'I led him into the upstairs bathroom next to the room I was staying in,' she writes in the diary obtained exclusively by Radar

Roberts, who lives in a small town in Colorado, claims the fifth in line to the throne 'spoke kindly of his daughters … [and] the conversation turned to me next, starting with Ghislaine playing the 'guess my age' game, which was one of her favorite's among her morally impaired friends.'

'He guessed 17 and Ghislaine chuckled, 'She'll be too old soon,' and told him I was really only 16.'

One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during this alleged encounter in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Maxwell looks on.

She claims Prince Andrew, father to Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24, paid particular attention to her toes and claims he was licking them

In her large and curly scrawl, she writes they had sex, which was' short-lived' and then he 'quickly got dressed, said his goodbyes and slipped out of my bedroom to the driver still waiting for him outside'

Roberts claims the group headed to dinner during which time 'the Prince's attention towards me amplified… making eye contact at every given chance and concentrating at my plunging V-neck top,.'

Roberts, now a married mother-of-three, writes the group then went to private, members-only nightclub Tramp in central London where she claims Prince Andrew grabbed them both an 'alcoholic cocktail.'

'He was the most incredibly hideous dancer I had ever seen and not to mention how embarrassing it was to have to be the one he was smashing pelvics with, even if he was a prince.'

She writes how they stayed at the club for just over an hour, but she could tell  he wanted to move on by the way he was 'fondling me on the dance floor, I knew that was a man's polite way of saying he wanted to intimately get acquainted.'

Roberts, now a mother of three, says the pair returned to Maxwell's house. 

'I led him into the upstairs bathroom next to the room I was staying in,' she writes in the diary obtained exclusively by Radar.

'I was doing my best trying to put on a good show for him by slowly undressing and started to pour a bath. 

'The room quickly filled with steam from the hot water as I turned to Andrew and began to kiss his neck and undress him.

'He was caressing every part of my naked body and filling my head with endless compliments about my blossoming figure.'

She claims Prince Andrew, father to Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24,  paid particular attention to her toes and claims he was licking them.

'That was definitely a 1st for me, but I went with it all, fearful of letting down the Prince and in turn Jeffrey and Ghislaine.'

In her large and curly scrawl, she writes they had sex, which was' short-lived' and then he 'quickly got dressed, said his goodbyes and slipped out of my bedroom to the driver still waiting for him outside.' 

In her entries she also claims that Epstein told her to recruit other girls, writing: 'I never brought back a girl that ever said no, or didn't want to participate in an erotic massage.'

On Tuesday his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson defended him against 'shockingly accusatory allegations' that he had sex with Roberts.

The Duchess of York described Prince Andrew as a 'humongously good man' when she was asked about the scandal on US morning television show Today.

In her entries she also claims that Epstein told her to recruit other girls, writing: 'I never brought back a girl that ever said no, or didn't want to participate in an erotic massage' 

She told the presenter the family stood by the denial issued by Buckingham Palace.

Sarah said: 'I won't stand by, because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies made up about you, and not support him so publicly because they are just shockingly accusatory allegations, which I don't think that's right.

'It's defamation of character and, as a great father and humongously good man and all the work he does for Britain, I won't stand by and let him have his character defamed to this level.'

She added: 'I'll have not one word said about him on any level.'

When asked if Andrew knew the woman involved Sarah said she would not discuss the subject.

She said: 'Buckingham Palace has put out the denial and I, as his best friend and my best ex husband ever and the most wonderful father to the girls, will not be drawn on any subject.'

In a strongly-worded statement Buckingham Palace has said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.

'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.'

Andrew was named in US civil court documents as having sex with Roberts on three separate occasions when she was a minor.

She is said to have been 'procured' for him by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire American financier, who she accuses of using her as a 'sex slave'.

The Duke vehemently denies the allegations against him.

Maxwell and Epstein have also dismissed the allegations.

Roberts, a US citizen, waived her anonymity in an interview with The Mail On Sunday in 2011, in which she claimed she had been sexually exploited by Epstein - a former friend of the Duke.

In the US court papers, she alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein where an orgy took place.

Others named in the lawsuit have also denied the claims.

Attorney and former Harvard Law school professor Alan Dershowitz said the accusations were 'totally false and made up'. 

The accusation is contained in a motion filed last month in a Florida court by Roberts who wants to join an existing lawsuit, launched by two other alleged Epstein victims, against federal prosecutors' handling of the financier's case.

Epstein was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution but lawyers for the women claim a secret plea deal he struck with prosecutors granting him, and any potential co-conspirators, immunity from further prosecution violated their clients' rights.

Two years after his 2009 release, Epstein was pictured in New York City with the prince, and their friendship was a source of controversy. 

Prince Andrew ultimately stepped down from his role as a U.K. trade ambassador in July 2011.

Court documents also allege that Prince Andrew was among those who made 'efforts' to secure Epstein a favorable plea deal, but Buckingham Palace has denied this. 

In a strongly-worded statement, a palace spokesman said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.

'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.'
