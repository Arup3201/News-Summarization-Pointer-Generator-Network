When it comes to physical education at this school in China, pole vaulting is strictly forbidden.

Long jump and the hurdles are probably frowned upon, too.

Students are encouraged to keep their feet firmly on the ground, because they keep fit four-storeys up – on the roof.

The elementary school in Tiantai, Zhejiang province, boasts a 200m running track on its roof, built because of a lack of construction land on the campus.

The track meets the needs of 1,600 students for physical education, Qiu Tianguo, the head of the school said.

To keep the students safe there are three protective layers. On the outside is a 1.8metre-tall (six-foot) glass wall, in the middle a green belt and closest to the track is a 1.2 metre (four-foot) steel rail, according to Ecns.cn.

There are also several surveillance cameras monitoring student activity.

Ruan Hao, chief architect, told the site: ‘Under the circumstances that limited land cannot provide enough space for students to exercise in, we chose to challenge the concept that playgrounds and tracks have to be on the ground.’

The design has received recognition around the world, having represented China at the 14th Venice Architecture Exhibition this year.
