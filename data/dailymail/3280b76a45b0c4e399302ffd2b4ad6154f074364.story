Mousa Dembele has responded to Gary Neville’s suggestion that Tottenham are ‘weak’ and ‘never ready’.

Former Manchester United defender Neville blasted Mauricio Pochettino’s team after they capitulated against Newcastle United at White Hart Lane a fortnight ago to lose 2-1.

The SkySports pundit insisted he always suspected Tottenham were ‘weak up here (in the head)’ after they let their half time lead slip in the Barclays Premier League match.

'When I think of (Mauricio) Pochettino at Southampton, a team that always seemed ready, they were always alert. You never thought you could catch them out, certainly not with what I’d call basic tactics like this.

‘And yet when you talk about typical Tottenham, he’s got to affect the culture at that football club and it runs right the way through it.

‘This is a coach who had a bright team, an alert team last season. He’s got to affect the culture at this football club.

‘It’s what I think of Tottenham historically, never ready, weak, weak up here (in the head), and they have to change that culture.

‘I think Pochettino needs to be given two or three years to run amok through that club to get rid of that type of attitude.’

Neville added he felt Pochettino developed a far more composed team at Southampton and that the ‘culture’ at White Hart Lane is in need of a revamp.

Tottenham found themselves on the ropes in yet another second half on Thursday evening.

The north London club held on to a scrappy 2-1 win over Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League and, while Dembele insisted Neville’s criticism was news to him, the Belgium international was quick to defend.

‘I think we’re not weak but I didn’t hear this. I think we think differently about this,’ said Dembele. ‘Every team has some weaknesses and we have our own things to think about.

‘We need to be ready quicker, from the first minute. We did it in the first half and then in the second half we didn’t expect them (Asteras) to come at us. 

‘We were too relaxed and this cannot happen again. We need to speak about it.

‘Personally there are some reasons why in the second half we didn’t do so well but we will talk with the team about it. A lot of people have their opinion so we will talk internally.

‘We were surprised by them. It can’t happen again because we could have ended up drawing or losing.

‘We need to learn that even when we’re 2-0 up it’s not over yet. That’s the lesson.’

Dembele is to be reunited with manager Mark Hughes on Sunday when Stoke visit White Hart Lane.

The pair worked together at Fulham, with Hughes handing Dembele his Premier League debut against Manchester United in August 2010.

And the 27-year-old Tottenham player praised Hughes for getting his career in England going.

‘For me he was a very good manager,’ Dembele said. ‘It was my first year in the Premier League and he spoke a lot with me.

‘Maybe the most important thing was the confidence he gave me. How he spoke with me and he made me important in the team. It made me feel very important and that’s a big thing.

‘Everyone can see (Stoke) are a good footballing team now. Before they did different things.

‘In general he is a coach who gives confidence to his players and likes to play football as well, which you see at Stoke now.’
