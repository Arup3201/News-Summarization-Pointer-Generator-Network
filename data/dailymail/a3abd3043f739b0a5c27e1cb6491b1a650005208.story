When Alison Morales found out her three-day-old son Ryan had severe haemophilia, all she could think about was how much pain she watched her father go through when she was growing up.

Mrs Morales, from Quakers Hill in Western Sydney, always knew there was a risk she would pass on the rare and incurable bleeding disorder to her children because her dad suffered from it his whole life.

But the 37-year-old couldn't help but burst into tears when she thought about what it would mean for her baby.

Ryan Morales and his grandfather Gerard Carson, who died in 2009 aged 64, both suffered from haemophilia

Ryan has learned how to administer his own injections to help him cope with the rare bleeding disorder and is now a fit and active 10-year-old who loves to be outdoors

'All I could think of and see was my dad, who was 60 at the time, riddled with arthritis,' Mrs Morales told Daily Mail Australia.

'You can see in photos he just looks frail, he still had a good life and he had a wife and kids but he did suffer a lot of pain.

'When I found out with Ryan I thought it would be the same thing, that I've brought this baby into the world and he's not going to be able to play sport and he'll have all this trouble.'

Because her father - who died in 2009 at the age of 64 - had haemophilia, Mrs Morales is a carrier and her children have a 50-50 chance of suffering from the disorder.

Almost all people with haemophilia - including about 2800 Australians - are male. Men with haemophilia transmit the gene to their daughters, but not their sons.

Women who carry the gene may transmit the gene to their son, who will have haemophilia, or their daughter who can also carry the gene.

Ryan, now 10, and Mrs Morales' two-year-old son Thomas both have haemophilia, but her five-month-son James doesn't. 

Her 12-year-old daughter Lara doesn't suffer from the disorder but they have yet to test whether she is a carrier.

Mrs Morales says Ryan is, thankfully, able to do most things boys his age can do.

Treatment has advanced greatly since the days of her childhood and Ryan is able to receive a factor VIII injection – which adds a protein that helps the blood to clot – every two days.

'He's a sporty, active kid and he loves to be outside,' Mrs Morales said.

Ryan has recently learnt how to do the factor VIII injection himself – something that has proven very helpful when trying to teach Thomas (pictured) about his own injections

'He's energetic, he plays soccer, he plays tennis, he does triathlons, likes riding his bike, riding his scooter, jumping on the trampoline.

'Thankfully there is this factor replacement, he would be tearing his hair out if he wasn't able to do those things.'

But there are still risks. It is a myth that he could bleed to death from a tiny cut, but if Ryan were to have a big fall he would suffer immensely from internal bleeding.

'When they cut themselves or fall over and things that type of bleeding isn't a concern,' Mrs Morales said.

'The problem for severe haemophiliacs is the bleeding on the inside of your body.

'The biggest fear is any head bleeding, with a bad fall they could have bleeding on the brain which could cause a world of problems and could potentially be fatal.'

At 10 years old Ryan already suffers from arthritis in his ankle because it has had so many internal bleeds at that spot.

Ryan has recently learnt how to do the factor VIII injection himself – something that has proven very helpful when trying to teach Thomas about his own injections.

'Even for Ryan, Ryan grew up seeing my dad have to have factor sometimes, and we would say "You can be brave like Poppy",' she said.

'Now that's the same for Thomas, we say "Ryan's having his factor, Ryan's brave, he doesn't cry".

After winning a competition at the Children's Hospital at Westmead he is starring as the lead character in a new comic book aimed at helping kids better understand the disorder

'As much as you don't want to have two sons have haemophilia in some ways it's nice they can go through it together.'

But his little brother isn't the only haemophilia sufferer Ryan is set to help.

After winning a competition at the Children's Hospital at Westmead he is starring as the lead character in a new comic book aimed at helping kids better understand the disorder.

'He loves it, he was so excited,' she said.

'He took it straight to school to show his friends and teachers.

'Which is nice because he would never have so much to smile about in terms of his haemophilia otherwise.'

The Medikidz Explain Haemophilia series was developed by Pfizer Australia in collaboration with the Kids Factor Zone - a specially designed unit for families dealing haemophilia – at the Children's Hospital. 

It will be launched on Thursday morning by Ryan and shark-attack survivor and Royal Australian Navy diver Paul de Gelder.
