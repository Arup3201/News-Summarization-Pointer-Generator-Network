The family of Hector 'Macho' Camacho tried to decide Wednesday 
whether he should be removed from life support after a shooting in his 
Puerto Rican hometown left the former boxing champion clinging to life 
and his fans mourning the loss of a dynamic and often troubled athlete.

Doctors at the Centro Medico trauma center in San Juan found that 
Camacho had irregular and intermittent brain activity late Wednesday, 
said Dr. Ernesto Torres, the center's director.

'We can't declare him brain dead,' he said. 'We're going to ask the people of Puerto Rico to keep praying.'

Torres said doctors will conduct additional tests early Thursday but warned the prognosis remains dire.

'The changes have been more negative than positive,' he said, adding 
that Camacho does not have enough blood coursing through his brain.

Doctors initially had said Camacho was in critical, but stable 
condition and expected to survive after he was shot Tuesday night in the
city of Bayamon. But his condition worsened overnight and his heart 
stopped at one point, Torres said.

The 50-year-old Camacho was shot as he and a friend sat in a Ford 
Mustang parked outside a bar. Police spokesman Alex Diaz said officers 
found nine small bags of cocaine in the friend's pocket, and a 10th bag 
open inside the car.

Camacho's mother, who flew in Wednesday from New York, will lead the 
discussion about whether he should be removed from life support, said 
Ismael Leandry, a longtime friend and former manager who was also at the
hospital.

'We just have to wait to see if `Macho' gets better. It's a hard 
battle,' Leandry told The Associated Press as he joined friends and 
family outside the emergency room.

Torres said Camacho's mother, Maria Matias, spent about 20 minutes 
with her son, one of the most dynamic boxing personalities of his era, 
and was expected to return for a second visit on Wednesday night.

'His mother came and she is devastated,' he said. 'She knows the prognosis is not at all favorable.'

A godson, Widniel Adorno, said the family has discussed the possibility of organ donation but no final decision has been made.

Camacho's friend, identified as 49-year-old Adrian Mojica Moreno, was
killed in the attack. Police said two assailants fled in an SUV but no 
arrests have been made and no motive has been disclosed.

Camacho was rushed to Centro Medico, where doctors initially said the
bullet passed through his jaw and lodged in his shoulder. Torres said 
the bullet damaged three of the four main arteries in his neck and 
fractured two vertebrae, which could leave him paralyzed if he were to 
survive.

Steve Tannenbaum, who has also represented Camacho in the past, had 
been told earlier by friends at the hospital that the boxer would make 
it.

'This guy is a cat with nine lives. He's been through so much,' he said. 'If anybody can pull through it will be him.'

Friends and family members waited anxiously at the hospital, fondly 
recalling Camacho's high-energy personality and his powerful skills in 
the ring.

'He was like a little brother who was always getting into trouble,' said
former featherweight champion Juan Laporte, a fellow Puerto Rican who 
grew up and trained with Camacho in New York.

Camacho has been considered one of the more controversial figures in 
boxing, but also popular among fans and those who worked in the sport.

'The Macho Man was a promoter's dream,' renowned promoter Don King told 
AP. 'He excited boxing fans around the world with his inimitable style. 
He was a nice, amiable guy away from the ring.'

King had promoted Camacho but was caught off guard by news of the attack
on the former champion. 'What a tragedy this is,' he said. 'I'm very 
sorry for Hector and his family. My prayers go out to him.'

The fighter's last title bout came against then-welterweight champion 
Oscar De La Hoya in 1997, a loss by unanimous decision. He last fought 
in May 2010, losing to Saul Duran. Tannenbaum said they were looking at a
possible bout in 2013.

'We were talking comeback even though he is 50,' he said. 'I felt he was capable of it.'

Camacho was born in Bayamon, one of the cities that make up the San Juan metropolitan area.

He left Puerto Rico as a child and grew up mostly in New York's Harlem 
neighborhood, one of the reasons he later earned the nickname 'the 
Harlem Heckler.'

He went on to win super lightweight, lightweight and junior welterweight world titles in the 1980s.

Camacho has fought other high-profile bouts in his career against Felix 
Trinidad, Julio Cesar Chavez and Sugar Ray Leonard. Camacho knocked out 
Leonard in 1997, ending what was that former champ's final comeback 
attempt.

Camacho has a career record of 79-6-3.

In recent years, he has divided his time between Puerto Rico and 
Florida, appearing regularly on Spanish-language television as well as 
on a reality show called 'Es Macho Time!' on YouTube. In San Juan, he 
had been living in the beach community of Isla Verde, where he would 
obligingly pose for photos with tourists who recognized him on the 
street, said former pro boxer Victor 'Luvi' Callejas, a neighbor and 
friend.

'We all know what Macho Camacho has done, but in the last couple of 
months he hasn't been in any trouble,' Callejas said as he kept vigil 
outside the hospital. 'He has been taking it easy. He's been upbeat.'

Drug, alcohol and other problems have trailed Camacho since the prime of
his boxing career. He was sentenced in 2007 to seven years in prison 
for the burglary of a computer store in Mississippi. While arresting him
on the burglary charge in January 2005, police also found the drug 
ecstasy.

A judge eventually suspended all but one year of the sentence and gave 
Camacho probation. He wound up serving two weeks in jail, though, after 
violating that probation.

His wife also filed domestic abuse complaints against him twice before their divorce several years ago.
