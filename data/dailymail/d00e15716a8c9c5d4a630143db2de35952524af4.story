It is known to millions of viewers as the picturesque home of curmudgeonly GP Doc Martin. But now the sleepy Cornish village of Port Isaac has been rocked by a tale of fraud, intrigue and revenge as dramatic as the most outlandish TV script.

Police have been called to investigate a bitter vendetta against local hotel owner Paul Williams, which revealed his secret criminal past to unsuspecting neighbours.

The 56-year-old was exposed as a convicted conman via a campaign of anonymous emails, prominent street posters, and computer discs mysteriously dropped off to homes. They revealed that in 2006 Mr Williams 
was jailed for 18 months by a judge who called him ‘a charlatan, a 
conman and someone who piratically preys’ on vulnerable elderly people.

Mr Williams had posed as a clairvoyant, telling a widow he had contacted her dead husband who told him that his will – in fact a forgery – was hidden in a grandfather clock. A few months later, he defrauded a blind 82-year-old man.

Mr Williams had thought he had put that reputation behind him when he moved to Port Isaac – known to Doc Martin fans as Port Wenn – and took over the Bay Hotel.

The building appears in the show as Wenn
House and regularly plays host to cast and crew, including star Martin 
Clunes, making Mr Williams something of a local celebrity, especially as
he also regales guests with stories of the wild times he says he spent 
with 1980s band Dexy’s Midnight Runners.

But not everyone has been charmed. Tom Lane, proprietor of The Edge restaurant opposite the Bay Hotel, fell out with Mr Williams late last year after a business deal went sour. Mr Williams had invested £5,000 in The Edge in November 2011, but Mr Lane was disappointed with how their relationship developed. ‘He never put in the hours he promised,’ he complained. ‘He would just wander in, put his feet up with a cup of tea and chat to customers. I bought him out for £40,000 in December as I couldn’t stand it any more.

‘Nothing about him rang true. He told me and other locals that he was in Dexy’s. He said the royalties from songs like Geno were enough to live on for a year. It was all rubbish. After I saw the posters and got one of the CDs, everything became clear.’

The business spat meant the finger of suspicion pointed at Mr Lane. Police investigating the campaign against Mr Williams seized his computer, but it has now been returned, and no one has been charged.

Troubled times: The next series of Doc Martin, set to air in the autumn, is likely to be the last, leading to fears that the Bay Hotel's tourist trade could dry up

On Friday, Mr Williams admitted his criminal past but said the vendetta against him was motivated by jealousy, that it included intimidation and blackmail, and even claimed his brakes had been tampered with.

He said: ‘I did wrong. I’ve paid for it. I’ve got myself clean. I’ve got off the alcohol. I’ve got off the drugs – put my life right. I’ve done everything I can in this village and taken The Bay from an old dump to a very successful business.’

However, there are fears the lucrative trade from tourists and the TV production could dry up, as the next series of Doc Martin, set to air in the autumn, is likely to be the last.

And Mr Williams’s life in Port Isaac is no longer rosy since the campaign. He is rarely seen outside his hotel and his 23-year-old wife Katie Williams, a flautist, and their two-year-old daughter do not appear to have lived there since last year.
