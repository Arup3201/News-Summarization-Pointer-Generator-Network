Strolling out of court with his hoodie zipped up to his eyes, this is Cherif Kouachi denying terror charges seven years before his massacre in Paris.

Newly-emerged footage from 2008 shows the Charlie Hebdo gunman claiming he was 'set up' over a plot to smuggle Islamists into Iraq to fight U.S. troops - a crime of which he was later found guilty.

Kouachi, who spent half of his three-year sentence in jail before being freed to commit his rampage, told journalists he and his six co-defendants were just 'passionate young kids from the suburbs'.

'We're just passionate': Footage has emerged of Cherif Kouachi defending his extremist views in 2008

Kouachi, pictured, was later found guilty of a plot to smuggle extremists into Iraq to fight U.S. troops

His voice muffled by the jumper drawn round his mouth, he told reporters: 'The whole thing has been set up. We are just young kids from the suburbs, that is all.

'We get passionate, we talk like this but there is nothing more, that's it. We did nothing wrong.

'There was no intention (from us), now they pretend things, but who cares. We will see and I hope that it will show evidence.' 

Then aged around 25, Kouachi was sentenced for his part in the Buttes Chaumont network, named for the park in northern Paris where they used to meet.

They were accused of recruiting radicalised worshippers from a Paris mosque and organising their transfer to Iraq, where the battle between insurgents and U.S. and British troops was at its height.

All seven of the men, six French and one Algerian, were found guilty of 'criminal association in a terrorist enterprise'.

Protest: Kouachi, then 25, said he was innocent and the trial by a French court had been a 'set-up'

'Tell them it's not true,' he called up to reporters before leaving the courthouse. 'I did nothing wrong'

The video, found in the archive of the news agency Reuters, showed another of the accused running down the steps of the courthouse with his hoodie pulled up, refusing to be interviewed.

Kouachi then stopped again on the steps and called up to reporters: 'Tell them it's not true. I did nothing wrong'.

Also on trial was Kouachi's alleged mentor Farid Benyettou, who was found guilty and jailed for six years.

Now 33, Benyettou was jailed for six years and has since trained at a nurse - even working at a Paris hospital which treated victims of the massacre.

Earlier this week he distanced himself from the attacks and said they were would be condemned by the Islamic faith itself.

'I condemn what was done,' Benyettou said in an interview with the iTELE news channel.

'I want to send this message: Islam condemns everything that has been done - the cowardly and monstrous murder of journalists, of police officers and members of the Jewish community.

'That should not be attributed to Islam. It's the worst crime that a Muslim could commit.' 

Benyettou said two months ago Kouachi came to see him 'out of the blue'.

'The only thing he wanted to talk about was fighting,' he said. 'He didn't want to know about good relations with his neighbours, or acting like a good Muslim'. 

Benyettou dismissed suggestions that he had ever been tempted to use violence and rejected the idea that France 'oppressed' Muslims.

'I am the proof that it's the opposite,' he said. 'I have a criminal record that is rather hard for people to swallow. I have been convicted for terrorism, which is the worst offence.

'But even so, I have never been discriminated against.'

He added that in the wake of the attack he voluntarily went to the intelligence services. He was questioned for two hours before being freed.

Solidarity: Protests in the Spanish capital Madrid, one of dozens of cities which saw marches after the attack 

Kouachi, 32, and his brother Said, 34, killed 12 people including a Muslim police officer when they stormed the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last Wednesday.

Questions have been raised over whether the men could have been stopped after it emerged there were extensive links between them and other jihadis known to the security services. 

Cherif Kouachi had been forbidden from leaving France after he travelled to Yemen in 2011 for weapons training.

Two senior Yemeni sources told Reuters on Sunday that both Cherif and Said Kouachi were smuggled into Yemen after arriving in Oman on July 25, 2011.

Meanwhile the attacks' alleged mastermind Hayat Boumeddiene, whose husband killed four people at a kosher deli, was also days from being caught by agents in Istanbul before the attacks.

She went on the run to Turkey on January 2 and police raided the Bade Otel where she had stayed on January 5, but she had already departed on her way to Syria.
