The Labour-run NHS in Wales is lagging behind England on almost every measure, according to a shocking new report.

The first comparative study between the two healthcare regimes reveals that patients in Wales are waiting far longer for vital tests and life-saving treatment than those in England, where the NHS is run by the Coalition government.

They are also likely to have to wait longer for an ambulance in an emergency and will be seen more slowly if they need to attend A&E. Astonishingly, the target for treating cancer cases referred by GPs in Wales has not been met since the middle of 2008.

The study, produced by the respected House of Commons Library, is a devastating blow to Ed Miliband’s claim that only Labour can be trusted to run the NHS.

It confirms the findings of a Daily Mail investigation last year which sparked clashes in the Commons between David Cameron and Mr Miliband. Yet last night, Labour was still rejecting criticism of its handling of the Welsh NHS, saying it was ‘misleading’ for the Commons Library to make comparisons between the health services in England and Wales.

The report found that ambulance response times to life-threatening emergencies in Wales have worsened, despite a fall in the number of calls. And the number of patients waiting more than the four-hour target time for A&E treatment is double that in England.

The stark gap in performance between the NHS in England and Wales is likely to be a key election issue. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said the report ‘confirms our worst fears and lays bare the devastating consequences of Labour cuts to the Welsh NHS’.

He added: ‘Despite the best efforts of dedicated staff, Welsh NHS performance is significantly poorer than in England, where the health budget has been protected in recent years.

‘On almost every measure Welsh patients receive an inferior service when compared to patients across the border, and having run the Welsh NHS since 1999, Labour must take full responsibility for their appalling management of the health service.

‘Ed Miliband seeks to portray himself as the saviour of the NHS in England. But in truth, the Welsh experience of a Labour-run health service has shown that they simply cannot be trusted anywhere near it.’

Health campaigner Gareth Williams, of the ABMU Victim Support Group, described the report’s findings as ‘depressing, but not at all surprising’.

Mr Williams, whose mother died following ‘unacceptable treatment’ at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend in 2012, said Wales was becoming a ‘second-class nation’ in terms of healthcare. ‘The Welsh Government is in abject denial about the scale of the crisis in the NHS in Wales,’ he added.

The Commons Library report raises real concerns about the level of service offered to patients in Wales.

England and Wales have different hospital waiting list targets, but the report notes that ‘referral to treatment waiting times in Wales are typically longer than in England’.

In August, a third of patients receiving hospital treatment in Wales had waited more than 18 weeks, compared with just 6 per cent in England. Last year just 60 per cent of Category A 999 calls received a response within eight minutes – below the 65 per cent target. In England, the figure was 74.8 per cent.

The Labour-run government in Cardiff repeatedly dismissed the Daily Mail’s exposé of serious problems in the Welsh NHS as ‘political smears’. We began our campaign in October:

OCTOBER 20, 2014: The Mail published the first of a series of articles about the problems in the Welsh NHS. The Welsh Government claimed the allegations were ‘spurious’ and rejected calls – made by the British Medical Association and politicians from across the spectrum – for an independent inquiry.

Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones admitted he had not read the Mail’s reports before dismissing our investigation out of hand and suggesting the issues raised had ‘been dealt with already’. He added: ‘To suggest that the NHS in Wales is somehow in every way in a more difficult state than in England is quite simply wrong.’

The Welsh Government released a 2,447-word statement claiming there were ten inaccuracies in our coverage, but the Mail replied with a point-by-point refutation, quoting official statistics and statements.

OCTOBER 21: After the Mail published its second round of stories, Mr Jones told the Welsh Assembly that ‘the vast majority of people get the best care most of the time’ in the Welsh NHS. He accused the Mail and the Department of Health of turning Wales’s health service into a ‘political football’.

OCTOBER 22: The Mail published further articles exposing the scandal of Welsh NHS patients having to wait so long for operations that some were dying before they could be treated. The Welsh Government issued another lengthy statement, this time 1,006 words long, which accused us of ‘quoting selectively’ from reports.

OCTOBER 24: The Mail focused on how Welsh cancer patients were being denied life-saving but expensive new treatments that are made available to sufferers in England through the Government’s Cancer Drugs Fund.

The Welsh Government rejected calls for it to introduce a similar fund, quoting claims that the NHS in England was funding medication that had ‘no impact on survival’ and may not improve quality of life.

The report also highlights funding cuts that belie Mr Miliband’s claims that Labour will always support the NHS. While health spending in England has been protected from cuts since the election, funding in Wales has fallen in real terms. Spending on health in Wales fell from £6.3billion at the time of the election to £6billion in 2012/3 in real terms.

A spokesman for the Welsh Government said it was ‘misleading’ to make comparisons between the NHS in England and Wales.

He said: ‘The report refers to a range of NHS performance data comparing England and Wales, even though numerous authoritative independent sources caution against such comparisons because of the differences in the way NHS performance is measured in England and in Wales. The Welsh Government dealt extensively with the misrepresentation of the Welsh NHS in the Daily Mail recently.’ 

Cancer treatment goals not met since mid-2008

Targets for treating cancer patients referred by their GPs have not been met in Wales for more than six years, according to the report.

The Welsh NHS says 95 per cent of patients diagnosed with cancer by their GP should start ‘definitive treatment’ within 62 days, but the Commons Library study says that ‘was last met in mid-2008’. Last September, just 85 per cent of patients started the so-called ‘urgent route’ to treatment on time.

Ironically, those bypassing the ‘urgent route’ and going straight to hospital were likely to be treated far more quickly. The ‘non-urgent route’ target of treating 98 per cent of patients within 31 days is being met.

Today’s report also highlights other areas where patients in Wales wait much longer than those in England on average. In October, 93 per cent of patients waiting for hospital treatment in England had been on the waiting list for fewer than 18 weeks, compared with 72 per cent in Wales.

Of those treated in August, 94 per cent in England had waited fewer than 18 weeks, compared with 66 per cent in Wales.

For CT scans, 100 per cent of patients in England are tested within six weeks, compared to just 82 per cent tested within eight weeks in Wales.

For non-obstetric ultrasound tests, 99 per cent of patients in England are tested within six weeks, compared with 70 per cent tested within eight weeks in Wales.

On A&E services, England and Wales have the same target that 95 per cent of patients should have to wait less than four hours. In 2013/14, 13 per cent of patients attending A&E in Wales waited more than four hours – double the level in England. In Rhyl and Swansea, almost a fifth of patients waited more than four hours.
