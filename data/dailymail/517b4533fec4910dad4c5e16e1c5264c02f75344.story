Virginia police say a 53-year-old man has been indicted on murder charges in three shocking slayings that spread fear through a quiet neighborhood in Alexandria for almost 11 years.

Authorities announced on Monday the grand jury indictment of Charles Severance, who is in jail in Loudoun County awaiting trial on a gun possession charge. 

The indictment contains ten charges, including two charges of capital murder and one charge of first-degree murder in the deaths of Ruthanne Lodato, Ronald Kirby and Nancy Dunning. 

Charles Severance, shown here speaking with his attorney during a court proceeding in March, was indicted on ten charges tied to the slaying of three people in Alexandria over the past 11 years

Alexandria Police Chief Earl L. Cook discussed the indictment with reporters on Monday, saying he was confident Severance was the man behind the grisly murders

'I am confident that the suspect Charles Severance is the suspect we have been looking for, which is now almost 11 years,' Alexandria Police Chief Earl Cook said during a press conference today. 'This case is another example of Alexandria's commitment to bring people to justice.'

Alexandria Commonwealth's Attorney Bryan Porter said he doesn't intend to seek the death penalty, the Washington Post reported. 

The maximum sentence Severance could face if convicted is life in prison.

The first death Severance is charged with, that of Dunning, wife of then-Alexandria Sheriff Jim Dunning, occurred in December 2003.

The second came almost ten years later, in November 2013, when 69-year-old Kirby, an official with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, was slain.

The most recent of the three murders occurred in February when music teacher Lodato was killed in her home.

All three were killed in their homes or at their doorways during daylight hours.  

A caretaker who survived the February attack helped police create a sketch of the killer, one of a series of breaks that apparently led led police to declare they believed the cases were linked.

Severance was indicted on the following charges involving the killings of Nancy Dunning, Ron Kirby and Ruthanne Lodato: 

The clues also led local police, with the help of Virginia State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, to Severance.

The eccentric Civil War eccentric who ran for mayor of Alexandria twice had been living with his girlfriend in Loudoun, according to the Post.

After police contacted him, he left the state. 

He was eventually arrested in Wheeling, West Virginia, on gun charges and expedited to Virginia. As a convicted felon, Severance is not allowed to possess firearms.  

Severance's lawyer had argued that the weapons charge was a sham' intended to give Alexandria authorities more time for their murder investigation.

Police had been reluctant to publicly link Severance to the killings. But the investigation became 'very intensive' over the past five months, Cook said. 

'We were motivated to find justice for victims and closure for the families,' he said. 'This is a very emotional crime. This is a very personal crime.'
