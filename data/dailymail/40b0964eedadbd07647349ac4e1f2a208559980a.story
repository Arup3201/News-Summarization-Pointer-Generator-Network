The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge began legal proceedings last night against a French magazine which published topless photographs of Kate.

As sources close to the couple said she felt ‘violated’ by the pictures, there was mounting fear among royal aides that the Duchess faces being relentlessly stalked like the Princess of Wales.

A strongly worded Palace statement compared the photographs to the ‘worst excesses of the Press and paparazzi during the life of Diana’.

It is the first time in modern history that a British royal is set to sue through the courts in France for ‘breach of privacy’ over what the couple described as a ‘grotesque’ and ‘unjustifiable’ act.

A source at French Closer, which 
claims to be the country's leading women's 'people' magazine, said its 
website would be carrying the topless pictures too.

But in conflicting reports, U.S. 
entertainment website Radar Online said the site had already removed the
 pictures in response to the legal threat.

Yesterday the 30-year-old Duchess tried to mask her humiliation as she followed in the  footsteps of her husband’s late mother by visiting a mosque for the first time in bare feet and a veil.

She and Prince William learned of the existence of the pictures – which show Kate removing her bikini top as she sunbathed by a pool during a holiday in France last week – while in Malaysia continuing their Diamond Jubilee tour.

The Prince told those close to him that it was ‘as if the clock had been turned back 15 years’ to when his mother died in a Paris car crash while being chased by photographers.

The Mail has learned that legal papers have already been served on the French magazine Closer and an initial hearing will be heard in the French courts on Monday.

If the judge decides the couple have a strong enough case to proceed they will immediately seek an injunction to stop all photos from the holiday being published. It is also hoped that it will emerge at the hearing who took and who owns the copyright to the pictures.

Legal action: It is the first time in modern history that a British royal is set to sue through the courts in France for 'breach of privacy' over what the couple described as a 'grotesque' and 'unjustifiable' act

The show must go on: The Royal couple looked pensive at a tea party in Kuala Lumpur yesterday

Last night the magazine’s editor 
Laurence Pieau was unrepentant about the pictures, apparently taken from
 1,000 yards away with a long-distance lens. She insisted that the 
swimming pool was in full view of a public road and the images were ‘not
 in the least shocking’.

She even argued that it was the couple’s own fault as ‘they were not making any special effort to conceal themselves’ and made claims about having ‘more intimate shots’ of the couple.

The Mail understands the Duke and Duchess have the unequivocal backing of both the Queen and Prince Charles for their legal action.

A St James’s Palace spokesman last night confirmed that ‘legal proceedings for breach of privacy have been commenced today in France by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge against the Publishers of Closer Magazine France’.

Secluded: The pictures were allegedly taken last week, while the couple were on holiday at Chateau d'Autet, set amid 640 acres of woodland in the picturesque Luberon region

French retreat: The explicit photographs were taken last week as the Duke and Duchess holidayed at a secluded Provence chateau, pictured, owned by the Queen's nephew, Viscount Linley

X marks the spot: The long lens pictures taken 
of the topless Duchess were shot from the side of the road between trees
 around half a mile away from the chateau

The explicit photographs were taken last week as the Duke and Duchess holidayed at a secluded Provence chateau owned by the Queen’s nephew, Viscount Linley.

Closer, one of the biggest celebrity glossy magazines in the country, which is unconnected to the British publication of the same name, yesterday splashed them across several pages including a topless picture of the Duchess on its front page, accompanied by the headline, in English: ‘Oh My God!’

The timing of their publication could not have been worse, coming so soon after naked photographs of Prince Harry were published on the internet.

Moving on: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge wave to the public during a walk through a central city park in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, yesterday

When Kate saw the pictures she was said to be ‘angry, upset and disgusted in equal measure’ while William ‘was just livid’.

The couple later issued one of the most strongly worded statements ever issued by St James’s Palace.

A source close to both William and Kate told the Mail last night: ‘The words in their statement were very much chosen by the couple and them alone.

'Grotesque, unjustifiable, saddened – they are all words that come from the heart.’
