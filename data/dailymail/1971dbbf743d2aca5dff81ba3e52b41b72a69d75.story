'Asteroid defence' has always focused 
on huge weaponry such as nuclear warheads or lasers - but Strathclyde 
researchers believe throwing a handful of rocks could do the trick 
instead.

Two engineers at the University of 
Strathclyde think that instead of the huge, cumbersome laser weapons 
proposed by earlier projects, a 'swarm' of tiny spacecraft weighing 
1,000lbs would deflect it.

Speaking at a conference in Atlanta 
Georgia, Alison Gibbings and Massimiliano Vasile, the two engineers 
propose a 'swarm' of solar-powered pebbles could deflect an asteroid by 
22,000 miles - enough to miss Earth entirely.

The swarm would be launched into orbit in a single rocket, New Scientist reports - then would form into a 'swarm' that would attack a 250m space rock head on.

Until now, research into an 'asteroid shield' for our planet has focused on huge satellites carrying equally vast weapons.

But
Strathclyde researchers think that smaller 'fighter' satellites could 
work together to destroy a huge asteroid.

Dr Massimiliano Vasile, of 
Strathclyde’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, is 
also researching another approach, where the small satellites would be 
armed with lasers, rather than using impact to deflect the asteroid.

Instead of knocking it off course, small laser satellites would 'chew away' at an approaching space rock.

He said: ‘The approach we are 
developing would involve sending small satellites, capable of flying in 
formation with the asteroid and firing their lasers at the asteroid at 
close range.

‘The use 
of high power lasers in space for civil and commercial applications is 
in its infancy and one of the main challenges is to have high power, 
high efficiency and high beam quality all at the same time.

‘The
additional problem with asteroid deflection is that when the laser 
begins to break down the surface of the object, the plume of gas and 
debris impinges the spacecraft and contaminates the laser.

'However,
our laboratory tests have proven that the level of contamination is 
less than expected and the laser could continue to function for longer 
than anticipated.’

A swarm of relatively small satellites 
flying in formation and cooperatively firing solar-powered lasers onto 
an asteroid would overcome the difficulties associated with 
current methods that are focused on large unwieldy spacecraft.

Just
over 100 years ago a 2000-kilometer area of vegetation was destroyed 
when an object believed to be 30-50 metres in diameter exploded in the 
skies above Tunguska, Siberia. Dr Vasile said: ‘The Tunguska class of events are expected to occur within a period of a few centuries.

'Smaller
asteroids collide with Earth more frequently and generally burn in the 
atmosphere although some of them reach the ground or explode at low 
altitude potentially causing damage to buildings and people.

‘We
could reduce the threat posed by the potential collision with small to 
medium size objects using a flotilla of small agile spacecraft each 
equipped with a highly efficient laser which is much more feasible than a
single large spacecraft carrying a multi mega watt.

'Our
system is scalable, a larger asteroid would require adding one or more 
spacecraft to the flotilla, and intrinsically redundant - if one 
spacecraft fails the others can continue.’

Dr Vasile is now investigating the use of the same concept to remove space debris.

The number of objects in orbit classified as debris is ever-increasing and with no widely accepted solution for their removal.

Researchers
at the University of Strathclyde believe the space-borne lasers could 
be used to lower the original orbit of the space debris and reduce the 
congestion.

Dr Vasile 
said: ‘The amount of debris in orbit is such that we might experience a 
so called Kessler syndrome – this is when the density becomes so high 
that collisions between objects could cause an exponentially increasing 
cascade of other collisions.

‘While
there is significant monitoring in place to keep track of these 
objects, there is no specific system in place to remove them and our 
research could be a possible solution.‘A
major advantage of using our technique is that the laser does not have 
to be fired from the ground. Obviously there are severe restrictions 
with that process as it has to travel through the atmosphere, has a 
constrained range of action and can hit the debris only for short arcs.’
