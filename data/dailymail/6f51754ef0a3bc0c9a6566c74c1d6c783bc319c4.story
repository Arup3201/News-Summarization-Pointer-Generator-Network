China is becoming a ‘security risk’ because of the military’s growing influence on the government, the Japanese government has claimed.

A power shift between generals and politicians in Beijing is a ‘matter of concern’, according to an annual defence assessment in Tokyo.

It highlighted how the Chinese People’s Liberation Army had spoken out more frequently on foreign policy.

Fear: There is concern across east Asia over China's growing military strength

And amid mounting unrest over the lack of political and social reform, the Communist government has been forced to tighten its vice-like grip on the population – a clampdown for which it relies on the Army.

China’s annual defence spending is said to have risen drastically, from £19billion in 2000 to £76billion in 2010.

On present trends the defence spending of China, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4billion inhabitants, could overtake America’s after 2035.

The Japanese assessment, which will be studied carefully in Whitehall, said: ‘The degree of military influence on foreign policy decisions has been changing.

‘This situation calls for attention as a risk-management issue.’

Tensions between Beijing and Tokyo surfaced again last month after Chinese vessels entered waters near disputed resource-rich isles in the East China Sea.

The rise of China has prompted the US to focus military resources on the Pacific instead of Europe.China insisted its military modernisation was not aimed at any other nation and criticised  ‘irresponsible statements’ by Japanese officials.

The report comes as China's senior officers, intelligence agencies and maritime chiefs are increasingly outspoken in calling for Beijing to take a tougher line in regional territorial disputes.

Such disputes include a long-simmering row with Japan in the East China Sea.

Last year, Japan welcomed China's growing role on the world stage, while noting its increasingly aggressive moves, saying: 'China has responded to conflicting issues involving Japan and other neighbouring countries in a way that has been criticised as assertive, raising worries about its future direction.'

Just like a year ago, Tokyo also noted China's rapid military build-up, particularly that of its navy, pointing out that Beijing's defence budget has risen 30-fold in the past 24 years.

Defence Minister Satoshi Morimoto said the sense of caution is shared by many countries in the region.

He said: 'It is not that caution has been rising. But it is true that there exists a certain sense of caution not only in Japan but across East Asia regarding which way China is headed.'

A Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman repeated the country's standard line that its military modernisation is both transparent and not aimed at any other country.

But spokesman Geng Yansheng criticised 'irresponsible statements' by Japanese officials over the disputed islands in the East China Sea, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, and said China would defend its rights.

He declared: 'Protecting national sovereignty and maritime rights and interests is the common responsibility of all concerned departments, including the military, and we will closely coordinate with other departments in conscientiously discharging our responsibilities.'

New concern: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un

Tensions with China have also risen in the South China Sea as Beijing becomes more assertive in its claim to the area.

The stakes have risen in the region as the U.S. military has shifted its attention and resources back to Asia in the past year.

In the white paper, Tokyo reaffirmed the importance of its alliance with the United States, saying: 'The presence of U.S. forces stationed in Japan functions as deterrent against regional contingencies, and it brings the sense of security to countries in the region.'

The official reassurance comes against a backdrop of public protests against the planned deployment of U.S. Osprey military hybrid helicopter-planes to a U.S. base in Okinawa, because of concerns about their safety.

And in its first defence white paper since Kim Jong-un took over the reins of power in North Korea, Japan said the aspiring nuclear power remained a major security threat.

'After the death of National Defence Commission Chairman Kim Jong-il, First Chairman Kim Jong-un frequently visited the military and referred to the importance of the military. Its stance of regarding the military as important and relying on it will likely be maintained,' it said.
