This unfamiliar yellow vegetable could be about to make its purple relation turn green with envy.

For the first time, a yellow variety of beetroot has become available to buy in the UK - and its stainless nature could see it rival the popularity of its more traditional relative.

Known as a Yellow Cylindrical, it tastes similar to its purple cousin, but is said to have a slightly sweeter, stronger flavour.

Dobies of Devon, in Paignton, has this year started selling seeds of the Yellow Cyndrical – Beta vulgaris in Latin – which can be grown in British gardens.

The seeds, which cost £1.49 for 200 and were imported from a Polish supplier, should be planted in the ground between March and June and harvested between July and December.

While Francijn Suermondt, of Dobies of Devon, suggested the vegetable is ‘tastier’ than its purple counterpart, she admitted one of the main appeals is the stainless nature of the root vegetable.

‘Its real bonus is its colour and there is far less chance of anything becoming stained by it – unlike normal beetroot,’ she said.

‘Chefs have also mentioned that the cylindrical shape of the beetroot is easier for chopping.’

Advising customers on how to deal with the seeds, she added: ‘They should be sown thinly and directly into finely raked, moist warm soil at a depth of half an inch in rows about 12 inches apart.

‘They grow best in a sunny position in soil which has not recently been manured.’
