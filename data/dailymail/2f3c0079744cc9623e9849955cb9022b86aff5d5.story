A renowned doctor has been accused of trying to beat his neurosurgeon son-in-law to death with a pry bar outside his home as he went through a bitter divorce with his daughter.

Dr Georges Bensimhon, 66, an anesthesiologist from Allentown, Pennsylvania, allegedly drove six hours through the night to Dr Seth Alan Hoffer's Cleveland Heights, Ohio home to attack him.

Once there, he hid in bushes outside the home and when Dr Hoffer emerged just before 6am, the older doctor allegedly pounced on him.

But Dr Hoffer, 39, had heard rustling in the bushes behind him and footsteps and turned to see a figure wearing a black ski mask and blue surgical gloves.

Arrest: Dr. Georges Bensimhon, 66, faces felony assault and kidnapping charges after he allegedly beat his son-in-law with a pry bar outside his Ohio home earlier this month

His attacker allegedly hit him across the forehead with the pry bar before continuing to beat him several times on the head and bite him, police said, ABC News reported.

But Dr Hoffer was able to overpower his attacker, breaking his arm and forcing him to the ground.

At that point he heard his alleged attacker scream: 'Alan, get off of me! I can't breathe' - and he knew the man behind the mask was his father-in-law, police said.

Police said Bensimhon had a backpack filled with syringes, different 
types of anesthetics, a screw driver and additional surgical gloves when he approached the house.

Battle: The attack came as his daughter, Danielle Bensimhon, left, and son-in-law, Dr Seth Alan Hoffer, right, are going through a bitter divorce battle and are fighting for custody of their one-year-old daughter

Fight: The girl currently lives with her mother in Florida - and Hoffer was on his way to visit when he was attacked

Police arrived on the scene after multiple neighbors called 911 hearing someone screaming for help and seeing a man covered in blood. Officers found Hoffer pinning Benhimhon to the ground.

Hoffer, who suffered wounds to his head, was leaving the home for the airport to fly to Florida, where his estranged wife, Danielle Bensimhon, is living with their one-year-old daughter Lila.

ABC reported that Danielle Benhsimhon and Hoffer are going through a bitter divorce and custody battle for the little girl.

He also has a seven-year-old daughter from his first wife, who died in 2007. The girl was being looked after by a sitter while her father was being attacked outside.

Police arrested Dr Bensimhon after the attack and a grand jury indicted him on one count of attempted aggravated murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of felonious assault.

He appeared in Cleveland Heights Municipal Court on September 5 and was released on $500,000 bond. He's due back in court September 25, when he is expected to enter a plea.
