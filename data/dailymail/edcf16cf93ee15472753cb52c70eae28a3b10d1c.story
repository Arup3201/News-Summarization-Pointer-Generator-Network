Former NFL star and ‘Inside the NFL’ host Ahmad Rashad is reportedly dating President Barack Obama’s senior adviser.

Rumors have been flying all over the capital that Rashad and Valerie Jarrett are an item, but no one appears willing to confirm or deny the supposed romance.

Rashad himself told the New York Times to 'get a hobby while I get my phone number taken off the listing’ when asked about he and Jarrett.

The former Minnesota Viking’s appearances at Michelle Obama’s 50th birthday party earlier this year and at the president’s unveiling of his ‘Mr Bother’s Keeper’ initiative aimed at helping young black man find career paths only further stoked the rumor mill flames.

Whispers grew into chatter though when Rashad was seen playing golf with President Obama on a recent family vacation – Jarrett did not join them on the links but was on the trip, the Times noted.

The paper also mentioned the White House press office ‘strongly objected’ to their report on what may be Washington’s latest power couple, and no photos of them together are to be found anywhere.

‘They haven’t gone out in public,’ an unnamed source told New York Post columnist Richard Johnson last November. ‘They are sneaking around.’

Rashad’s brother also did not appear willing to confirm or deny his brother’s relationship status with the Times.

‘I know Valerie is the president’s head girl, but I didn’t know anything about that,’ said Robert Moore. Rashad changed his name from Bobby Moore decades ago when he converted to the Muslim religion.

The television host’s presence on the golf course wasn’t welcomed by everyone, according to an email chain review by the Times.

One former White House staffer is said to have asked ‘what the hell is going on out there’ after seeing the popular NBC personality putting with Obama.

But Moore has other ideas, and joked to the Times that ‘maybe we’ll get an ambassadorship.’

Chatter, jokes and whispers may be all there is until Rashad and Jarrett both step forward – if they ever do.
