Remember those Black Fridays from not so long ago where Rory McIlroy would turn up with his B game, shoot 40 or so for nine holes and blow his chances of winning?

If truth be told, he had another ordinary Friday here at the 96th USPGA Championship, hitting just eight fairways and 11 greens in regulation.

How terrifying for the opposition, therefore, that the newly-refocused Rory still shot a four under par 67 to add to his opening 66 to lead the season’s final major at the halfway stage. 

If McIlroy is now able to hit the front playing average, what on earth is going to happen when he showcases his A game?

McIlroy leads by a shot on a good-looking leaderboard from dangerous Australian Jason Day and veteran American Jim Furyk, with fellow countrymen Rickie Fowler and Ryan Palmer two shots adrift.

Still on top: McIlroy wasn't at his brilliant best on Friday, but he still takes a one-shot lead into the third round

In the swing: The Northern Irishman is playing as close to perfect as you can get in the majors at the moment

Then comes Phil Mickelson after a spectacular eagle three at the last and Austrian Bernd Wiesberger, with two European big hitters – Henrik Stenson and Lee Westwood – four shots behind. 

Westwood slipped back after his marvellous first round 65 but is still in contention to win his first major after a 73. Ian Poulter was another to regress with a 73.

Tiger Woods? Thank goodness he has now gone home after missing the halfway cut by a comfortable margin following a second round 74 because this was painful to watch. 

Difficult Tiger: It was a sad sight to see the 14-time major champion struggle with injury and form

Whatever happened to the 14-time major champion who only ever played to win? Here, he limped around both physically and metaphorically to raise the question again: what on earth was he doing here? Let’s hope we don’t see him again until he is healthy - however long it takes.

As for McIlroy, add these two rounds to the four he played at Royal Liverpool at The Open and the 72 holes at Firestone last week, and that makes him 41 under par for the duration, with only one round in the seventies.

It’s worth spelling them out: 66,66,68,71,69,64,66,66,66 and 67. If that is not the perfect ten rounds, it must be as close as damn it.

McIlroy was asked for the umpteenth time why it has all gone right but this time gave a particularly candid answer. 

He did not say or mean it unkindly, but he did pinpoint the moment he ditched his tennis-playing fiancé, Caroline Wozniacki, at the end of May. 

Problems: Bubba Watson failed to find his best form, and later had to apologise for his behaviour on the course

‘I think what happened has been for the best in terms of my golf,’ he admitted. ‘I’ve put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now? 

'I go to the golf course, to the gym and it’s just my life at the minute. I worked pretty hard before but the past couple of months I’ve really just buried myself in my game. It obviously works pretty well, so I am going to keep doing it.’

A deluge created fresh water hazards in the middle of fairways and caused a 50 minute suspension early on. The day called for the steadfast rather than the spectacular, but trust McIlroy to come up with a mixture of both.

Starting from the 10th, he had one eagle three at the 18th and should have had another at the 7th where he missed from 8ft. 

But this was a round where he also showed off some of the overlooked qualities of his game, including his new-found resolve to grind out a score.

A perfect Day: The Australian Jason Day is McIlroy's closest competitor after reaching eight under par

McIlroy missed his first four fairways plus five greens in regulation in a row at one point, but saved par expertly on several occasions with a few adept up and downs.

‘I think when you’re 100 per cent confident as I am now you know you’re going to get opportunities to put it right, so I know I am not going to go on one of those runs where I shoot a 42 for nine holes,’ he said. ‘Mentally, I am just in a far better place.’

McIlroy vowed to keep playing the same brand of smart but aggressive golf that won him The Open. ‘I think the only time I’ve ever tried to protect a lead was the final round of the 2011 Masters and that didn’t work out so well (he lost a four shot lead),’ he said. 

‘It took me a couple of years to learn to be comfortable with a lead but what works for me is to try to get four ahead if I am three ahead, and so on. Do I expect to win? I wouldn’t say that. But if I execute my game plan, there’s a good chance.’

Is there anything that can distract McIlroy from his mission? There was a fresh obstacle on Friday in the form of an insufferable example of self-pity from playing partner, Bubba Watson. 

On the charge: Rickie Fowler picked up eight birdies, more than making up for his three bogeys

Aren’t devout Christians supposed to be able to put things in perspective? Not this one on this day. He whined incessantly as his ball flew off in all directions except straight.

The American’s woes were just one more bit of good news for US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson, then, but McIlroy donned cloth ears to drown out the constant moans.

Bubba at least had the grace to apologise for his behaviour on Twitter afterwards. ‘Sorry for my actions today. Just trying to get better as a person,’ he wrote.

While McIlroy was unaffected, US Open Champion Martin Kaymer – the third member of the group - stumbled to a 74. 

Still in contention: An eagle at the last put Mickelson within three shots of the lead at the half-way stage

He was a typically class act afterwards, preferring to praise one of his playing partners rather than attack the other. ‘When Rory hits his driver that long and that straight and his short game is incredible, it is very difficult to beat him,’ he said. ‘

You just have to respect how good he plays. He’s definitely the best player in the world.’

Now, in his 25th major, Open Champion McIlroy has the chance to make it two wins in two months and make it four majors claimed at the age of just 25.

Anyone out there still doubt the Rory era has begun?
