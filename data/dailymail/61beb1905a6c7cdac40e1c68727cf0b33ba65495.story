Manchester City keeper Joe Hart has hailed his side's resolve for never giving up on securing their progress to the knockout stages of the Champions League.

The Premier League champions left it until the last group match, a 2-0 victory over Roma thanks to goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta, to reach the last 16 and avoid another humiliating early exit.

Hart, who was captain for the evening in Vincent Kompany's absence, is adamant the team are going in the right direction after the dramatic victory in Rome.

'We never wrote ourselves off, we're a strong unit,' Hart told Sky Sports. 'We believed in ourselves, we had a bit of a slow start but you don’t win the Premier League easily and we've done it twice in three years.

'We've got resolve, we've got character and we've got fantastic players - add that all together and we've got a chance.

'It's been a great performance, we are moving in the right direction. That's five or six games on the spin now that we've really stepped it up.

'We've been together for a long time and there's no international breaks about to disrupt what we're trying to do. We are going into December - Vinny's (Kompany) is going to be fit, the Wizard (Silva) is back - we are starting to get our players back and the squad is strong.'

Meanwhile scorer Samir Nasri echoed Hart's sentiments: 'Because Yaya wasn't there and Kun (Aguero) wasn’t there it was important for us to show that we are a team and we did that tonight.

'The manager told us to take our time. We won our last game against Bayern Munich in the last minute. We knew that we had to be patient and we did it and we scored and we won the game.'

Nasri was evidently relieved to fire in his spectacular long-range opener for Manuel Pellegrini's side.

'It was important for me to score. After surgery it took a while for me to come back to my full level and now I am. 

'My strike was important but at 1-0 the save the Joe made was amazing - and afterwards as well to hold on was good.'
