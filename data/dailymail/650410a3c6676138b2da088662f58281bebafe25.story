Liverpool midfielder Jordon Ibe is set to return to Anfield after being recalled from his loan spell at Derby County.

The 19-year-old talent has already played 24 times for the Rams this season, 20 of which in their Championship campaign, helping them to second in the table.

And it appears he will not be shipped out elsewhere, with Liverpool keen on keeping the youngster at Anfield for the time-being.

Last season, Ibe was loaned out to Birmingham, where they staved off relegation on the final day of the season

The Reds have struggled through the first half of the Premier League season, currently sitting in eighth, behind West Ham.

Ibe joined Liverpool from Wycombe in 2012, but has only made two Premier League appearances for Brendan Rodgers' side.

He was first loaned out to Birmingham, before heading to the iPro Stadium this season.
