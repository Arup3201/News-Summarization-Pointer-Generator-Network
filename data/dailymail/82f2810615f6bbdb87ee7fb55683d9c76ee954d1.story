Bryan Sotelo's mother can only watch while her son struggles to overcome a sickness that has paralyzed him in his arm and seems only to get worse.

The 11-year-old was sick in July when Yadira Garcilazo took him to the hospital in Allen, where doctors diagnosed him with a cold and sent him home. A week later, his arm was paralyzed.

'I was completely scared when he told me the next day, "Mom I cannot move my arm,"' Garcilazo told CBS DFW.

Now, according to the Dallas Morning News, Sotelo is undergoing physical therapy at Children's Medical Center Dallas and fighting to breath with a tracheotomy.

In the midst of panic over Ebola, the Centers for Disease Control positively confirmed 10 instances of enterovirus-D68 in the Dallas area.

It also confirmed there were 538 cases of the virus nationwide, in 43 states and the District of Columbia.

But paralysis like Bryan's is a rare symptom of the disease, which normally causes mild to severe respiratory illness that can include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough and body and muscle aches.

Still, WHNT reports that one case of paralysis in Michigan was linked to the disease. 

Outbreak: The virus struck in 43 states, the District of Columbia and in 4 Canadian provinces, leading doctors to call for the development of a vaccine

Four children in Colorado tested positive for enterovirus after being hospitalized for paralysis, according to NBC.

CBC is reporting that four cases of paralysis throughout Canada are also linked to enterovirus-D68.  

As of now, the CDC has not confirmed whether or not Bryan's tests have returned positive for the virus, though Dr Ben Greenberg, his attending neurologist at Dallas Children's is sure.

'Statistically, I bet it is,' says Greenberg, who has been monitoring Bryan since he was hospitalized with weakness in his arm in August. 

In recent weeks, conservative media outlets such as Breitbart have claimed a link between unaccompanied children immigrating over the U.S.-Mexico border and the enterovirus outbreak.

The spread of the virus and the lack of confirmed cases in states such as Florida and Nevada, traditional destinations for Hispanic immigrants, makes a connection unlikely.

Virus: The CDC reports that the enterovirus has been confirmed in 538 cases between mid-August and October 3, striking mostly children

One reason Greenberg says these cases are causing worry is because there is currently no known treatment to combat enterovirus.

Doctors worry that the neurological problems caused by the virus could be long lasting, in the same way that paralysis symptoms from polio outbreaks were permanent.

'We need to develop a vaccine now before it does a lot of damage,' Greenberg says.
