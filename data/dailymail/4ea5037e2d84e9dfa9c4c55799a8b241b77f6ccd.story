The boss of the BBC is on a collision course with MPs after he insisted the licence fee will work for at least another ten years.

Last week, the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said the £145.50-a-year charge was ‘anachronistic’ and should be scrapped within the next decade in favour of a flat-rate broadcast levy on all households.

But Lord Hall, the Corporation’s director-general, insisted yesterday that the licence fee ‘has got at least another ten years in it’, adding: ‘I think it could go well beyond that.’

Even if the fee is axed, he said it should be replaced by an equivalent charge.

Despite MPs painting a damning picture of the BBC – which they said had blown billions of pounds of licence fee payers’ money trying to be ‘all things to all people’ – Lord Hall was optimistic. 

'I think the committee’s report should really be commended because they have raised something which says, you know what, the licence fee isn’t dead,’ he said. 

‘The BBC ain’t dead. Actually, it’s got a real future.’

MPs said last week that a blanket levy on all households – not just those with televisions – should replace the licence fee which has funded the BBC for the past 69 years.

Yesterday, Lord Hall backed the proposal, but said it was simply ‘another way of the licence fee being modernised’.

But he also warned that the BBC risks ‘sleepwalking into decay’ unless it reinvents itself for the internet age by collecting users’ data.

Lord Hall said the Corporation is in danger of becoming ‘irrelevant’ if it does not gather information about viewers to tailor its services, in a similar way to Amazon and Netflix.

His remarks came as the BBC unveiled plans to ask users of its news app and iPlayer catch-up service to sign up to ‘myBBC’, so it can learn about individuals’ viewing habits and send them recommendations for other programmes and articles.
