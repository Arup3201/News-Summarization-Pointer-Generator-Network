ITV's first night of World Cup coverage was beset with problems as protesters hurled rocks at its beach-side studio and the channel's online service went down during the opening game.

Angry demonstrators pelted stones at the studio - situated next to the Copacabana Beach - so hard it smashed sections of the glass frontage.

ITV host Adrian Chiles was inside the 
studio at the time of the attack, along with several pundits including 
ex-Arsenal and England right-back Lee Dixon, former Italy centre-back 
Fabio Cannavaro and 1998 World Cup winner Patrick Vieira.

Football fans were also left furious after ITV's online service suffered technical difficulties halfway through the first match of the tournament, Brazil's clash with Croatia.

Protesters gathered outside the ITV studio - next to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro - with banners that read 'Fifa go home'

After the match, Mr Chiles described how angry demonstrators targeted the broadcaster’s studio while waving banners and placards which stated: ‘Fifa go home’.

He said: ‘This demonstration materialised about 10 minutes before the end of the game.

‘We were all sitting up here and then suddenly sharp clattering sounds started greeting our ears, and that was them pelting the glass of our studio and other studios around here. We did try to explain to them that none of this is our fault at ITV Sport.’

Football legend Gary Lineker also voiced his opinion on the attack.

He
 posted a picture on his Twitter profile of police in full riot gear at the scene after the 
protest broke out and captioned it with: 'Best defence on show this 
evening, right outside the TV studios'.

Football fans also took to Twitter to vent their frustration at missing parts of the opening game after ITV's online service suffered ' unprecedented technical problems'.

Due to the issues, some fans struggled to 
successfully watch all of the match, which kicked off after a 30-minute 
opening ceremony at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo.

Andrew Smith wrote on his Twitter page: ‘Is everyone else's ITV Player down too? Get it sorted!’

While Chris O'Callaghan said: ‘ITV player, why have you betrayed me?!’

And Claire Kitson also wrote: ‘ITV Player 
congratulations on picking the worst time to do maintenance on your 
website! Would it have killed you to wait 15 minutes?’

Responding to the barage of criticism, ITV blamed the high volume of viewers tuning in to watch the lively 'Group A' match.

A spokesman said: ‘Due to unprecedented numbers of users during this game we are currently experiencing some technical problems with our live coverage via ITV Player on PC/Mac.

‘We are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible and apologise for any inconvenience caused.’

The broadcaster came under fire during the last World Cup in 2010 when more than a million viewers missed England's opening goal at the tournament in South Africa.

Viewers were left furious when ITV1 HD switched to an advert followed by a blank screen as Steven Gerrard scored in the fourth minute against the USA.

Earlier today, riot police in Brazil fired rubber bullets and baton-charged protesters as violent clashes broke out just hours before the World Cup celebrations kicked off.

Noise bombs were also let off near the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo to disperse a crowd of about 200 demonstrators angry about government overspending on the event.

The protesters were trying to cut off a key avenue leading to the stadium, on the eastern edge of Sao Paulo.

At least one protester was arrested, local media reported. A producer for CNN was injured during the confrontation, witnesses said.
