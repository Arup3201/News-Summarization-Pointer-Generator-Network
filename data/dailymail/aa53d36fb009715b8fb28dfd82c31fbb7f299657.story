The killer who bashed a seven-month-old baby to death has finally been deported from Australia to Papua New Guinea, more than two months after he was granted parole.

It was a condition of his parole that Christopher Hoerler, a PNG national, would be released from prison straight into the custody of Immigration officials and immediately deported. 

However, Hoerler remained in the country after his August 14 prison release and the distressed family of his victim, baby Jordan Anderson-Smith, have been desperately trying to locate the criminal.  

Hoerler's visa, allowing him to stay in Australia, was cancelled in 2011. 

Christopher Hoerler has been deported to Papua New Guinea, more than two months after he was released from prison on August 14 for the brutal murder of baby Jordan. It was a condition of his parole that he would be immediately deported

The Crown prosecutor found that Jordan died from multiple injuries, including bruises and abrasions to his face, a torn lip, liver and bowel damage and crushed toes - which were inflicted when Hoerler put his then-girlfriend's son's toes in a clamp.

The Immigration Department confirm Hoerler was deported on Monday, according to the Daily Advertiser. 

'Once released on parole, the individual was detained as an unlawful non-citizen,' immigration minister Scott Morrison told The Daily Advertiser.

'Mr Hoerler was removed from Australia this week.'

After years of distress, the news is a small comfort for Jordan's father and his family. 

'I don't think there'll ever be closure but it's a relief,' Jordan's uncle Darcy Smith told The Daily Advertiser.  

Baby Jordan was tortured and killed after a party at his mother's home in Wagga Wagga, NSW on February 25, 2000.

At the time of Jordan's murder, Hoerler was in a relationship with Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson. They lived together with Jordan and Jordan's two half-brothers, who were aged 2 and 4. 

Hoerler was tried for murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter 20 months after Jordan was killed. 

The 37-year-old ex-boxer was sentenced to 14 years and four months in Sydney's Long Bay prison, after prosecutors appealed the initial term of 11 years.

His sentence was due to expire in February 2016 but the State Parole Authority granted parole this year, citing Hoerler's good prison performance.

Darcy Smith is appealing to the Minister for Immigration, Scott Morrison to ensure Jordan's murderer, Christopher Hoerler, is deported when he is released from prison next week on August 14, 2014.

'The Smith family are extremely disappointed in the decision the parole board has made to release this convicted child killer back into the community,' Jordan's father Cecil Smith wrote at the time.

Hoerler and Ms Anderson had been smoking cannabis and drinking at their home before Jordan's horrific, brutal death.

Jordan choked on his own vomit after being beaten and tortured by Hoerler, with injuries including a lacerated liver, a torn lip, facial abrasions and broken ribs. 

Jordan's toes had  been crushed by a clamp and his teeth went through the roof of his mouth.

The forensic pathologist who conducted the post mortem found that the baby's 'palate injury was caused by a blow to the jaw, and the abdominal injury by a non-penetrating blow or blows of considerable force'.

Jordan's injuries were so extensive that they took four days to document. 

Jordan's father had contacted the Department of Community Services when he believed Hoerler was showering with Jordan. 

Jordan would have turned 15 on July 24 this year.

Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson, is pictured leaving her baby's murder trial in 2003. Christopher Hoerler was found guilty of brutally murdering seven-month-old, Jordan Anderson-Smith. Hoerler was Mrs Anderson's live-in boyfriend at the time of the murder.

The family was not convinced that Hoerler would be immediately deported so launched an online petition in July, calling on immigration minister Scott Morrison to give assurance that Hoerler would be immediately deported.

The Smiths feared Hoerler would appeal the deportation condition of his release because he has biological children living in Australia and could claim that he wanted to be a father to them, Fairfax newspapers said.

'He is trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat to stay in the country,' Darcy Smith said on behalf of the family.

'I hope the minister is smart enough to see through that.'

Previously, Mr Smith has spoken of the family's intense and unrelenting grief.

'We are the ones living with the life sentence. We have to live without Jordan every day.' They explained that their mother, Jordan's paternal grandmother, visits Jordan's grave every Sunday.

The Smith family have previously explained that Hoerler had moved into the home only three weeks before he murdered Jordan.

Hoerler met Ms Anderson on New Year's Eve in 1999, but by less than two months later, on February 25, 2000, he killed her son.

The baby's father had attended school with Hoeler and once considered him a friend. 

The Smith family have thanked the Wagga Wagga community for their ongoing care and support.
