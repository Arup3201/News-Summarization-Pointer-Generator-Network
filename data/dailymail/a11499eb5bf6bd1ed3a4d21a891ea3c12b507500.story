Leeds United have been hit with more bad news as the Championship outfit's chief operating officer Matt Child has quit his role at the club with immediate effect. 

Child, who is a lifelong Leeds fan, took control of the day-to-day running of the club after president Massimo Cellino was banned by the Football League from having any involvement. 

However Child decided to resign from his post at Elland Road on Monday morning, leaving the club to look for a new chief operating officer.
