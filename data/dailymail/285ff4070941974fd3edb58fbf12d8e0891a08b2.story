Real Madrid will have to part with at least £74million to sign Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, the France international's agent Mino Raiola is quoted as saying in Marca.

The 21-year-old Pogba is one of the most coveted talents in Europe and has been pivotal as his Juve team have built a 10 point lead over Roma at the top of Serie A.

But reports of Madrid's interest will not cease and thanks to Raiola, it seems they now know how much it will cost to get a deal over the line.

Marca report that for Real Madrid to sign Paul Pogba, they will need to pay 100 million euros (£74million)

'If Madrid want him, they can call me,' Raiola is quoted as saying. 'He's worth more than €100 million (£74million), but the price will be set by the club that buys him. I'm in contact with all of them, except Real Madrid.

'For me, he is the flagship of a new generation, the star, the leader. Today, there is nobody like Pogba. Including Barça, there are only seven clubs that can afford him.'

And if Madrid fend off the interest of the world's biggest clubs for Pogba's signature this summer, it appears their spending will not stop there. 

AS report that Madrid will also meet the release clause of Valencia's left-back Jose Gaya, which stands at £13.5million. 

Elsewhere in Spain, Mundo Deportivo lead with Barcelona renaming their first-team training pitch after their late coach and manager, Tito Vilanova.

In Italy, Parma are descending into further chaos as a financial meltdown has seen their game against Udinese on Sunday called off.

Corriere dello Sport say that Parma's entire season is at risk, as from now on, if they don't play, their opponents will be gifted a 3-0 victory.

The paper adds that despite promises from owner Giampietri Manento, money has dried up at the club and there is a 'hole' worth £74million.

Meanwhile, La Gazzetta dello Sport leads with Juventus' 2-1 victory over Atalanta, which was sealed with a goal from talisman Andrea Pirlo in the final minute of the first half.
