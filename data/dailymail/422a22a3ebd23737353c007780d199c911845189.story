A family has been awarded a million dollar payout after shocking undercover footage revealed their mother was being abused in her care home.

Eryetha Mayberry, 96, had dementia and was living at Quail Creek Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Oklahoma when her daughters Doris, Earlene and Sandra suspected that caretakers were stealing from her. 

They installed hidden cameras that collected footage of employees manhandling the grandmother by shoving latex gloves into her mouth and hitting her head.

After seeing the footage, the family filed a civil lawsuit, and Friday the nursing home was found guilty of negligence, and the family was awarded $1.2 million in compensation, according to Fox23.

Eryetha Mayberry, 96, had dementia and was living at Quail Creek Nursing Home and Rehabilitation Center in Oklahoma. The grandmother was shown in footage having latex gloves forced into her mouth by caretaker Lucy Waithira Gakunga (above Mayberry sitting left as Gakunga, right, shoves gloves into her mouth)

Footage also showed staff pushing Mayberry's her head to make her lie down (above)

A few months after the footage surfaced, Mayberry (above) passed away in July 2012

Gakunga (left) has since been convicted for abuse by caretaker in the case and was also fired. Her colleague Caroline Kaseke (right) was also caught on tape watching the incident involving the gloves. She was subsequently fired and still has a warrant for her arrest

The family also assisted in passing the POLO Act, a law allowing cameras inside of rooms at nursing homes, according to News9. 

Following the incident three years ago, caretakers Lucy Waithira Gakunga and Caroline Kaseke were subsequently fired from the home and turned over to police. 

The video footage that was handed over to police allegedly showed Gakunga shoving latex gloves into Mayberry's mouth and forcibly holding them there while Kaseke watched, according to NewsOK.

The nursing home has been found guilty of negligence and the family was awarded a $1.2million compensation (above Mayberry and two of her daughters)

The family filed a civil lawsuit against the nursing home (above) which reached a federal court room

Gakunga has since been convicted for abuse by caretaker and Kaseke still has warrant for her arrest.

A few months after the footage surfaced, Mayberry passed away in July 2012.

Daughter Doris Racher, said: 'All in the memory of our mother. All of us fought hard and are just happy that now we can relax a little bit, and mother's probably smiling.'

'I'm so glad and grateful for the outcome, because we told the truth, and the truth always prevails,' she added.

Attorneys for the facility said the family was awarded too much money as the care home is only worth $2.8million, and that the jury misapplied the law and granted an excessive award of damages.

Attorneys for Quail Creek Nursing home said they will appeal the verdict to the tenth circuit if they find it necessary.

Oklahoma was ranked 49th in the national nursing home rankings last year, according to a second annual report card that analyzes eight federal measures to determine care home quality.

The state previously held the 48th spot and now ranks as the third worst nursing home state.

'Inadequate staffing contributed to the enormity of Oklahoma's nursing home neglect,' said Brian Lee, the group's executive director. 

'Residents are unable to be cared for properly if 80 percent of the homes have middling to below average professional nursing levels.'
