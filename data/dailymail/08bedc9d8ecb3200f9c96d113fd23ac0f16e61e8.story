Next time you buy an app that you realise you don’t like, or you're not a fan of a book you've just purchased, Apple will give you your money back.

Previously, refunds were made on a case-by-case basis and often only with good reason, but the latest update means customers don’t even have to explain why they want their money back.

All cancellations must be made in writing, within 14 days, and the updates only apply to customers in the EU.

Apple updated its App Store, iTunes and iBooks terms and conditions (pictured) meaning any customer in the EU can cancel an order within 14 days of receiving a receipt. The updates came into effect on 16 December and have been made to comply with the recent EU directive on consumer rights. It does not apply in the US

The updates came into effect on 16 December and have been made to comply with the most recent EU directive on consumer rights.

This directive was passed in June and was designed to replace the previous consumer rights directive for customers across the union.

Under the original directive, people who bought items online, on the phone, or by mail order, had a seven-day ‘cooling off period’ to decide if they wanted to keep or return the items.

The new directive extends this to 14 calendar days.

The withdrawal period starts from the moment the user receives the goods, rather than when the purchased is completed. 

If a user chooses to cancel their order, they must do so in writing, within 14 days. 

An exception is iTunes gift cards that have been redeemed. 

Apple recommends people request a refund using the Report a Problem link in the email reciept. 

Alternatively, they can send a Model Cancellation Form, or by email as long as the 'statement is clear.'

Once the cancellation notice has been sent and acknowledged, Apple will reimburse the customer ‘no later than 14 days’ from the day on which it received the notice. 

This means consumers can legally return the goods, for whatever reason, if they change their minds.

The withdrawal period starts from the moment the user receives the goods, rather than when the purchase is completed - which was previously the case.

As Apple’s new terms explain: ‘If you choose to cancel your order, you may do so within 14 days from when you received your receipt without giving any reason.

‘To cancel your order, you must inform us of your decision.’

An exception is iTunes gift cards that have been redeemed. 

‘To ensure immediate processing we recommend you use Report a Problem to cancel all items with the exception of iTunes Match, Season Pass, Multi-Pass and, unless purchased from a third party or redeemed, iTunes Gifts and Allowances, which can be cancelled by contacting iTunes Support,’ continued the terms.

Once the cancellation notice has been sent and acknowledged, Apple will reimburse the customer ‘no later than 14 days’ from the day on which it received the notice.

Apple recently updated its stores to replace the ‘Free’ button with ‘Get’.

By comparison, Google's Play Store offers a two-hour return window (pictured) for apps downloaded by anyone - regardless of where they live. European users then additionally get 14 days to cancel music subscriptions, compared to seven days for customers worldwide

This was similarly in response to an EU directive created to make sure customers are aware that even though an app is free, there may be in-app purchases.

Amazon lets people return eBooks within 14 days of the book being received, but all purchases of apps from the Amazon app store are final and are not refundable.
