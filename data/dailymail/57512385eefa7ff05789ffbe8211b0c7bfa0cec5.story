Raheem Sterling may still be without a Premier League goal since September, but the 20-year-old can be pleased with his contribution following Liverpool's 2-2 draw against Arsenal.

Sitting at the very top of Brendan Rodgers' 3-4-3 system, Sterling looked a constant threat during the first 45 minutes despite losing his early exchanges with Arsenal defenders Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers.

The England international spent most of the initial period drifting across the line and found space well, often pointing to where he wanted the likes of Philippe Coutinho to play the ball.

The 20-year-old may not have had a direct hand in Liverpool's opening goal, but his darting run across the penalty area attracted the attention of German defender Per Mertesacker, giving Coutinho the space to fire Rodgers' side into the lead with a brilliant low strike. 

Meanwhile, after a poor first 30 minutes from Arsene Wenger's side, Alexis Sanchez was switched to the left as the visitors reverted to a 4-4-2 with Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck coming away from the wing to help lead the line. 

The Chilean seemed to attempt a dive midway through the first half after a tackle from Mamadou Sakho only for the ball to run out of play and referee Michael Oliver waved play on.

Just as Sterling had indirectly helped his side take the lead, Sanchez was sure to have a say in Arsenal's equaliser just two minutes later.

The Chilean forward, who played the majority of the game from the right, won a promising free-kick for the Gunners following a sharp turn away from Steven Gerrard.

Sanchez's resulting free-kick may have been a poor one, but Liverpool's inability to clear led to Mathieu Flamini being allowed enough space to head towards team-mate Debuchy who jumped higher than Martin Skrtel to pull his side back into the game.

With Rodgers chasing the game after a second half strike from Giroud, the Reds boss sent on Fabio Borini, sending Sterling out into a left wing back position. 

Sterling once again showed his knack of finding pockets of space in the second half as he ran down the left and unleashed a strike which Debuchy was able to block. 

Liverpool's cause wasn't helped by the late red card for Borini during a frantic nine added minutes of stoppage time but Sterling and Co continued to push before Skrtel managed to head home a late leveller.
