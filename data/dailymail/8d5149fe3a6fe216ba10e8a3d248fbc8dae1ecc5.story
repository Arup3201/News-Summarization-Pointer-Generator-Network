Police say they are growing increasingly concerned for a man who was reported missing after he failed to return home from watching a football match in a pub.

Colin Pine, 55, from Washington in Tyne and Wear, went out to watch the Tyne-Wear derby between Newcastle and Sunderland on Sunday.

He was last seen in the Swan pub in Felling, Gateshead and it is believed he spoke to his wife around 6pm to say he was going to get the bus home.

It is thought he left the pub at 9pm but after he failed to return, he was reported missing in the early hours of Monday morning.

Officers think he either caught a bus from the Heworth area of Gateshead to go home to Washington or he may have attempted to walk.

Today, police stepped up their search for Mr Pine and were seen scouring Albany Park, close to his home in Washington.

They also used police horses and a helicopter while they carried out their search.

Police believe Mr Pine either got on a bus in the Heworth area of Gateshead or attempted to walk home back to Washington 

Sunderland Area Command Superintendent Ged Noble said: 'At this stage it's believed he either got on a bus from the Heworth area to head home to Washington, or he walked from The Swan public house, so our focus at this time spans across the two areas of Gateshead and Washington.

'We're extremely concerned for Mr Pine's welfare, and obviously his family are desperate to hear from him.

'This is distressing at any time of year, but so close to Christmas makes it particularly difficult.

'I'd appeal for anyone who saw Mr Pine in the surrounding areas of The Swan, on public transport or walking between this area and Washington, as well as in his own local area around Albany, to get in touch.

'No matter how insignificant you may think the information is, it could prove vital in piecing together Mr Pine's movements."

He was last seen wearing a black fleece, a navy blue t-shirt, blue jeans and black walking boots.

Anyone who sees him or who knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Northumbria Police on 101.
