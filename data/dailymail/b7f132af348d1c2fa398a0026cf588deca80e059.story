Being hunched over a computer screen for hours at a time means three-quarters of us now suffer from back pain, experts say.

Rather than wrenching the back with strenuous exercise or hard lifting, sedentary lifestyles are the main cause of problems.

Lounging in front of a television or spending too long in bed are also major causes of back complaints, according to the British Chiropractic Association.

Being hunched over a computer screen for hours at a time means three-quarters of us now suffer from back pain, says British Chiropractic Association

Some 82 per cent of people now spend six hours a day in front of a computer screen, the association found in a survey of 2,000 people.

And 49 per cent of those questioned admitted they spent between two and six hours a day watching television.

Chiropractor Rishi Loatey said: 'As a nation we're becoming increasingly sedentary and struggle to switch off - whether it's sitting at a desk or lounging on the sofa, hunching over a mobile device or lying in bed for too long, the effects of modern lifestyles are taking their toll.

'Understanding how to sit properly and keeping active will help improve posture, strengthen muscles and therefore reduce neck and back pain.

Around 82 per cent of people now spend more than six hours a day in front of a computer screen

'With 35 million working days a year lost to back and neck related problems it' s really important that people think about their back health when going about their daily business, and that they seek help from an expert if they are in pain to avoid more long term problems.'

Some 77 per cent of people surveyed said they are currently experiencing back or neck pain or have done in the past.

And 24 per cent said they suffer on a daily basis.

The survey results suggest that 73 per cent spend more than six hours in bed, and 33 per cent spend between two and six hours looking at a laptop or tablet.

Chiropractors recommend that when sitting at a desk people have their back straight, arms close to the body and computer screens level with the eyebrows. The seat base should be tilted slightly forward, allowing for the knees to be lower than the hips and the feet to be flat on the floor.

They advise that people take a walk every half hour.
