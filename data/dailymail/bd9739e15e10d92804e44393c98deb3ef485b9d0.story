Wilfred De'ath was was kept on bail for more than three months over an historic sex assault allegation but was later cleared

A retired BBC producer arrested in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal launched a scathing attack on police last night after being told he will not face charges.

Wilfred De’ath, 75, accused the authorities of a ‘perversion of justice’ after he was kept on bail for more than three months over a sex assault allegation dating back almost half a century.

He was arrested by seven officers at 7am at his flat on Remembrance Sunday last year after being accused of assaulting a teenage girl in the 1960s.

Yesterday he was told he will not be 
prosecuted after the complainant, once a relatively well-known actress, 
withdrew her statement and said she was not willing to give evidence in 
court alone.

Mr De’ath, from Cambridge, is the 
first of 11 people arrested as part of the controversial Operation 
Yewtree investigation to learn his fate. He said he has endured a ‘very,
very unpleasant experience. I feel very indignant, I’m still very 
angry’.

He added: ‘I feel very bitter – I’m totally innocent.’

He also questioned why it was 
necessary for a team of officers to arrest him over such historic claims
and accused Scotland Yard of allowing ‘political correctness’ to 
‘outweigh common sense’.

A friend of his compared the behaviour
of investigators to that of the secret police in Communist East Germany
and the Soviet Union.

Jimmy Savile is one of the UK's most prolific abusers and has sparked an investigation into sexual activity at the BBC

The friend added: ‘At a time when 
known drug-dealers, murderers and other real criminals escape 
prosecution because of a lack of certainty of conviction, it has to be 
asked why this sorry affair ever took place.

Chief Crown Prosecutor Alison Saunders said that the case could not be pursued without the witnesses statement as there was not enough evidence

'Did the Yewtree team really
believe they could and should make a prosecution stick concerning an 
alleged incident from nearly half a century ago to which there were no 
witnesses?’

Mr De’ath once produced a Savile radio show but the allegations against him were unconnected to the disgraced paedophile.

The actress claimed Mr De’ath groped 
her thighs as they sat in a cinema in the 1960s when she was 14. She 
came forward after he was interviewed as part of a TV documentary about 
Savile’s past.

Mr De’ath said he had met the girl 
briefly at a party but had never gone to a cinema with her or assaulted 
her. Earlier this month he said he had ‘a feeling of vindictiveness’ 
towards the now elderly actress. Alison Saunders, of the Crown 
Prosecution Service, said the woman voluntarily withdrew her statement: 
‘She said that as she would be the only complainant to give evidence if 
the matter went to trial, she did not want to pursue it.

‘She confirmed she came to this conclusion of her own free will.’

Others who have been arrested as part 
of Yewtree are DJ Dave Lee Travis, paedophile Gary Glitter, celebrity PR
Max Clifford and comedian Jim Davidson.

In January Esther Rantzen, the founder
of Childline, criticised the inquiry, saying police were targeting the 
wrong people and creating confusion among victims.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
