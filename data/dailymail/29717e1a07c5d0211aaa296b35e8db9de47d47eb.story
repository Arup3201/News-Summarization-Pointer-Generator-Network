A high school math teacher who had his license suspended for sending text messages to students discussing their sexual experiences is to be allowed to return to the classroom at the start of the next school year.

George C. Merk was originally suspended from his job at Lakota West High School in Cincinatti, Ohio, for 10 days in March 2012 after an internal investigation into 'unacceptable, insubordinate, deceitful and unprofessional' behaviour.

According to Cincinatti.com, he 'admitted' to communicating with students over text message and other means on their 'sexual orientation and sexual experiences'

His five-year teaching license was suspended for a further 45 days last month after he signed an agreement with the Ohio Department of Education as part of the investigation.

The agreement also bans him from contacting students via Facebook or text message, requires quarterly reports regarding his conduct and will see him undergo training on student/teacher boundaries.

Mr Merk's actions did not warrant criminal investigation said West Chester Township Police.

The 41-year-old teacher's lawyer Julie Ford said that Mr Merk only signed the agreement with the Ohio Department of Education's Office of Professional Conduct to 'put this matter behind him and avoid any delays in the renewals of his current teaching licenses' rather than as an admission of any wrongdoing.

During an initial investigation by school officials in February last year, Mr Merk is said to have denied 'receiving a picture of a condom box through text message from a student.'

School Superintendent Karen Mantia wrote at the time: 'This behaviour us unacceptable and will not be tolerated.'

A report was then submitted to the state's Department of Education office with a full investigation culminating in the agreement last month.

According to The Journal, Mr Merk also failed to report that a student was bullied and posted Facebook statuses about students' academic levels and disparaging the school's administration.

Mr Merk has worked at the school since 2002 and earns just over $66,000 a year.

His file shows no evidence of any other transgressions during his career and he is regarded as having performed well at the school.
