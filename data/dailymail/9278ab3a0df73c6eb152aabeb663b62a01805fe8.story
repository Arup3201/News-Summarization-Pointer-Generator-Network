This chilling photograph reveals the school classroom where Ann Maguire was stabbed to death.

The image was released by prosecutors as William Cornick, 16, was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years for the killing of Mrs Maguire, 61, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April.

In an attack that shocked the nation, the boy winked at another boy before he launched into a savage assault in the classroom in front of a terrified class full of pupils.

Mrs Maguire was left with stab wounds as bad as any the paramedic who attended had ever seen, including one wound which went straight through her neck and another that cut her jugular vein.

Despite this, the teacher managed to leave the classroom, pursued by the boy until a colleague bundled her into a room and held the door shut. 

Leeds Crown Court heard how the boy went back into the classroom, sat down and said ‘good times’ in front of his traumatised classmates.

Cornick, who murdered the teacher in a ‘monumental act of cowardice and evil’ has been warned he may never be released from prison by a judge who found his lack of remorse ‘truly grotesque’. 

Mr Justice Coulson told the teenager - who stabbed Mrs Maguire seven times from behind as she taught - that he must serve at least 20 years in custody before he is ever considered for released.

But he warned the boy, who was 15 when he killed his Spanish teacher, that, having read about him, ‘it's quite possible that day may never come’.

The court heard how the teenager held a deep hatred of Mrs Maguire and had planned her murder, telling many of his friends of his desire to kill her.

After the murder he told experts that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’

Teachers and police who detained Cornick said he showed a bizarre calmness which continued as he was assessed by a range of experts.

The court heard he has never shown any remorse and has spoken of his pride in what he has done. When Cornick was sentenced today, as with when he was stabbing Mrs Maguire to death, he showed no emotion.

Cornick who the court heard came from came from a loving and supportive family, had also talked of attacking other school staff, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’.
