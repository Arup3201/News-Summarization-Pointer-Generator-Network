A teacher who survived for a year on just £1 a day has backed Iain Duncan Smith and said 'anybody' can live on a daily budget of £7.

Frugal Kath Kelly, 51, ate at free buffets, shopped at church jumble sales and scrounged leftovers from grocery stores and restaurants.

She picked fruit from bushes and trees and collected a staggering £117 in loose change dropped in the street - a third of her annual budget.

Frugal: Teacher Kath Kelly has backed Iain Duncan Smith and said 'anybody' can live on a daily budget of £7 a day by eating at free buffets, shopping  at church jumble sales and scrounging leftovers

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was challenged to live on £53-a-week by benefits claimant David Bennett on Radio 4

Ms Kelly, from Bruton, Somerset,
 even managed a free holiday in France by hitchhiking to the Channel 
Tunnel and persuading a French woman to take her as a passenger.

Yesterday she agreed with the Work and Pensions Secretary, who said that anybody can live on £53 a week.

She
 said: 'Anyone can do it, I found that myself but for people who start 
with more it will be more difficult for them to come down.

'We
 live completely differently now, I could still do it, parents would 
find it more difficult agreeably but it's still do-able. There are 
plenty of people around who do it.

'Things have gone up in price but in this climate the items are still available, you just have to know where to get them from.

'I have every confidence that somebody can put their mind to it and do it easily. You start to think about what you 
need, not what you want but what you actually need. It's surprising how 
much you can cut out that way.

'It comes down to a few things and that's when you work out what you will spend.'

The
 English teacher began her challenge in June 2006 when she bet her 
friends she could live on £1 a day for a year to save for her brother's 
wedding.

Challenge: Ms Kelly soon learned to spot a bargain and regularly visited supermarkets and butchers at the end of the day to buy reduced bread and vegetables

Ongoing: Ms Kelly gave up her challenge once it was completed, but she has said she still lived as frugally as she did before, spending around £6 or £7 a day

She soon learned to spot a bargain 
and regularly visited supermarkets and butchers at the end of the day to
 buy reduced bread and vegetables.

And
 even though she gave up her challenge once it was completed, Ms Kelly 
said she still lived as frugally as she did before, spending around £6 
or £7 a day.

'When it comes down to food it is easy, there are bargains, freebies and common plants you can forage for', she said.

'You just have to know when to get to certain supermarkets to get the deals.

'The
 plants are grown anywhere, even at this time of year, you just have to 
look for chickweek, nettles, wild garlic or young beech leaves - 80g of 
that is your five-a-day.

'It is more difficult when you have a family, I was single when I lived off £1 a day, but I still think you could do it.

'Even
 with kids you just need to look up things to do on the internet, there 
are so many free things in and around where you live. You don't need to 
spend money down the pub, yes it's nice to do that but you don't need 
to.

'We are used to 
many treats in our culture but we don't have to spend money. You can 
even do it with your friends, they don't have to spend money either.

'As for the bills, my rent included my bills so I did well that way. It didn't include internet or phone though.

'I used the library to send emails and keep in contact with friends, they allow you to get a couple of hours free.'

Ms Kelly, who lives with partner Bruce Taylor, said it would be difficult for Iain Duncan Smith to live on the small amount given what he was used to, but that it would be easy once he got used to the idea.

She said: 'I don't think it is difficult but I think it would be harder for somebody like him.

'I would love him to do it and if he wants some advice I'm here to help.'

Breadline: After he was challenged, Mr Duncan Smith insisted he would take 'no bloody lessons' from those calling for him to live on £53 a week, saying he had been on the breadline twice

Mr Duncan Smith was challenged to live on £53 a week during an interview on Radio 4 in which he defended wide-ranging cuts to welfare which took effect earlier this week.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said the Coalition's benefits reforms would allow people to 'break free' of welfare dependency.

But when challenged on whether he could live on £7.57 per day, Mr Duncan Smith replied: 'If I had to, I would.'

An online petition then calling on Mr Duncan Smith to live for a year on £53 a week, which had been seized on by Labour MPs opposing cuts to the vast welfare budget, attracted almost 300,000 signatures by the following night.

But Mr Duncan Smith insisted he would take ‘no bloody lessons’ from those calling for him to live on the small sum, saying he had been on the breadline twice.

He accused Labour and the BBC of fuelling a ‘stunt’ after he made the suggestion he could survive on that amount. 

A little goes a long way as the saying goes, but living off just £1-a-day really is making the pennies count. So how did Kath Kelly get by with an annual budget of £365 and what did she spend her money on:
