Family and friends of conjoined twins Faith Daisy and Hope Alice Howie have paid their tributes to the pair during an emotional memorial service held in Sydney's west today.

The family of the miracle twins, who died 19 days after they were born, wore pink at the chapel of the Pinegrove Memorial Park, Minchinbury, to honour the little girls who passed away due to complications resulting from their condition.

The pair were born on May 8 with an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus - which led to the twins being born with one body and two faces.

Speaking at the service, Renee's brother Paul Young paid his tributes to the pair calling them 'fighters' who 'were not too long for this physical world but were dearly loved.'

He said the girls' personalities were evident even at such a young age. He described Faith as 'a little cheeky and always trying to get attention,' whereas Hope was 'happy to just hold your finger and rest.'

Mr Young acknowledged the unconditional love Faith and Hope received from their parents, Simon Howie and Renee Young.  'Every time Faith and Hope would do something Renee would say: "Come and have a look at this", and Simon would bend over and give his daughters a kiss.'

Mr Young encouraged his sister to remember the moments she share with Faith and Hope, like: 'the way they just settled in your arms.'

'They were born into a life of love no matter how long they lived.

'In the words of Winnie the Pooh: "Sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart,'" he said.

Mr Young also paid tribute to nursing staff at Westmead Children's Hospital, where the girls were born and treated.

Faith and Hope were buried in a pink coffin and their family and friends released doves and pink and white balloons at the burial site.

Faith and Hope's young cousin Jamie-Lee read a speech at the graveside, saying: 'The first day I saw them I thought they were cute... I love them always.'

Mourners threw pink and white roses into the grave and released pink and white balloons at the graveside.

The family then released 19 white doves, one for every day the girls were alive, as a symbol of their love going with them.

Renee Young, the twins' mother, said: 'I'm lost for words at the moment.'
