A 42-year-old contractor employed by Olivia Newton-John and her husband has apparently shot himself dead at their Florida home.

Police responded to a possible suicide at the $5.6 million house in Jupiter at 12.15pm on Monday and Tequesta Fire Rescue confirmed they found a man's body at the scene.

Sgt. Scott Pascarella from the Jupiter Police Department said the man is not related to the homeowners and does not live there, but that the victim had permission to be at the home.

The 64-year-old actress and her husband, businessman John Easterling, 61, were out of town at the time of the shooting, officials said.

Contractors were at the house carrying out repairs and one contractor was seen crying there this afternoon, the Palm Beach Post reported.

Neighbors said they have not seen Newton-John at the home, which is being sold, in a while.

Police have released few details about 
the call and have not released an identity of the man, who is believed to have shot himself in the head.

While

treating it as a death investigation. The medical examiner and Jupiter

overlooking the water, since 2005.
