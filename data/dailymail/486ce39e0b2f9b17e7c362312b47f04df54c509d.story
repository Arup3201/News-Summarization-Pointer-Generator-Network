A man born without a left hand has had his new Terminator-style bionic arm redesigned so he can proudly wear his wedding ring.

Luke Medland, 31, was fitted with the latest carbon-fibre mechanical hand, which moves like a real human hand, seven months ago.

The Bebionic3 Myoelectric hand responds through electrodes to muscle twitches on his upper arm and allows him to do everyday tasks like holding on to tube trains like any ordinary commuter.

Luke Medland is thrilled that he can now wear his wedding ring on his specially-adapted bionic limb. The limb is so advanced he can even grip objects by twitching his muscles

But Luke, married for six years to wife Nancy, 28, found his wedding ring kept slipping off the £10,000 space-age prosthetic.

He asked the manufacturers to redesign the prosthetic lower arm and they dismantled it and fitted the ring.

They removed a portion of the gold and then moulded it to the same shape as the prosthetic finger and tested it before strapping it back on to Luke on Thursday.

The delighted father-of-two, from Wokingham, in Berkshire, now has the ring permanently on his false finger - even when he takes off the attachment.

Engineers removed a portion of the gold and then moulded it to the same shape as the prosthetic finger and tested it before strapping it back on

He said: 'It feels great to be wearing my wedding ring again - it's really special.

'It is nice for both my wife and I that I am able to wear it again and show the commitment we made to each other.

'It also takes away the slightly menacing look of the bionic hand.

'I used to wear a prosthetic that I could fit my ring over, but the new hand is smooth so my ring would just fall off.

'It
felt amazing to be able to do so many things which are normal for most 
people. But the fact I couldn't wear my wedding ring was a downside.

Luke said it is nice to is able to wear the ring properly because it shows the commitment he made to wife of six years Nancy (left)

'We mentioned this in passing to the 
manufacturers and were thrilled when they said they'd try to sort 
something out. They did a great job of it.'

Luke
tried various different prosthetic hands - some cosmetic focused and 
some mechanical - for 20 years after being born with no left hand.

He was approached by Royal National 
Orthopaedic Hospital seven months ago and asked if he would like to 
trial their latest hand - the most high-tech available in the world.

The hand is made of aluminium and alloy and is so sensitive Luke can even hold a piece of paper and double click a mouse

He controls the arm by sending signals from his brain to the muscles in his lower arm, which are detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 preprogrammed grips, mirroring human movements.

The hand, with aluminium and alloy 
knuckles, is so sensitive Luke can now hold a piece of paper and double 
click a mouse with it.

He
is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of
a trial, which it is hoped will see the electronic arm made widely 
available on the NHS.

He added: 'My hand is pretty cool - it is
like something from Terminator. 'I'd tried a series of prosthethics 
before, but they were all quite cumbersome.

The father -of-three said the chance to trial the futuristic hand was 'amazing' but not being able to wear his ring had been a 'real downside'. After the minor tweaks made by engineers he is now able to show his love for his wife openly

Bruce Rattray, product manager at RSLSteeper who manufacture the hands, said: "When Luke first trialled the hand, we encouraged him to undergo numerous tests in a variety of everyday situations.

This included using it on the crowded tube during rush hour, typing on a computer, making a sandwich and using a Kindle. By and large, everything went to plan.

'What we hadn't accounted for was the wedding ring. It was a pleasure to solvethe problem.'
