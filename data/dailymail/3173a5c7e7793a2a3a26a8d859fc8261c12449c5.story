The head of one of the Coalition’s first free schools has been arrested by police investigating allegations of fraud.

Sajid Raza was held in connection with a probe into the Kings Science Academy in Bradford which has been accused of ‘serious’ financial mismanagement.

The 41-year-old, who set up the school in 2011, was bailed pending further inquiries.

Last year, it was revealed that Kings Science Academy claimed tens of thousands of pounds in public money which was not used for its intended purposes amid allegations of financial irregularities and nepotism.

An investigation by the Education Funding Agency found that the school had been given £86,335 in funding which had ‘not been used for its intended purpose’.

It charged for first class travel, parties, buying furniture for staff and allegedly submitted ‘fabricated invoices’ to the Department for Education for rent it did not actually pay.

The revelation was a huge embarrassment for the Government and followed a series of controversies about free schools - state funded institutions set up independently of local authorities.

Kings Science Academy - which boasts Tory vice chair, Alan Lewis, as its executive patron - was among the first wave of free schools. It was visited and praised by Prime Minister, David Cameron, in 2012.

Detective Superintendent Lisa Griffin, head of crime for Bradford district, said yesterday: ‘As part of West Yorkshire Police’s ongoing investigation into matters at Kings Science Academy, Bradford, a 41-year-old man has today been arrested at premises in Bradford and is currently being questioned in relation to suspected fraud offences.’

The Department for Education said it sparked the police probe by referring the school to the UK’s national fraud reporting centre, Action Fraud, after receiving allegations of wrongdoing.

A DfE spokesman said: ‘The department acted as soon as it received allegations of wrongdoing at Kings Science Academy. We formally investigated and referred the case to Action Fraud.

‘This resulted in a police investigation which is ongoing. Separately we are recovering appropriate funds.

‘All free schools are held to rigorous account. The vast majority are performing well with three-quarters rated good or outstanding. But where there is failure we will not hesitate to intervene.’

Liberal Democrat Bradford East MP David Ward welcomed yesterday’s developments in the police investigation.

Mr Ward has raised a series of questions about the management of the academy and the role of Tory vice chair, Mr Lewis, who also owns the land the school is built on.

Last week, in the Commons, Mr Ward asked Education Secretary Michael Gove what steps his department was taking. Mr Gove said he had to careful not the prejudice the police investigation

Mr Ward replied: ‘That is disappointing, because of course the head of a maintained school would have been on his bike long ago.’

Labour MP Kevin Brennan asked the Secretary of State: ‘Mr Lewis is not just a benefactor; he is a landlord who will receive £12million in rent in years to come from the school, as well as a vice-chair of the Conservative Party and a major Tory donor.

‘Is that anything to do with the fact that the Secretary of State has refused to take any action whatsoever against anyone since this scandal broke?’

Mr Gove replied: ‘It is important to place on the record the fact that Mr Lewis is receiving for the property an appropriately guaranteed market rent - less than he was receiving for it beforehand.’

The Secretary of State defended his department’s handling of the case and said: ‘The law must follow its course.’

Last October, the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was threatened with closure after Ofsted criticised it as ‘dysfunctional’.

In December, the Discovery New School in Crawley, West Sussex, was axed amid ‘continued inadequate teaching’.
