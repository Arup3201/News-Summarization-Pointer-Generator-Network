Google and other internet giants came under fierce attack from David Cameron yesterday for ‘effectively denying responsibility’ for vile online images.

The Prime Minister, unveiling measures to try to limit the impact of online porn, said watching hardcore material was ‘in danger of becoming a rite of passage’ for Britain’s youngsters.

‘Our children are growing up too fast,’ he said, confirming plans revealed in yesterday’s Mail for all 19million households connected to the internet to be forced to say whether or not they want to continue having access to legal adult material.

Blacklist: David Cameron warned search engines like Google and Yahoo they have a 'moral duty' to act against banned search terms

On illegal child porn, Mr Cameron said the way internet search engines behaved was the equivalent of the Post Office ‘helping someone identify and order illegal material... and then sending it on to them’.

In such circumstances ‘they would absolutely be held responsible for their actions’.

Demanding that search engines ‘step up to the plate’, the Prime Minister said: ‘We need a situation where you cannot have people searching for child abuse images and being aided in doing so.’ 

Mr Cameron said web firms should block all searches that include words on a blacklist being drawn up by watchdogs and ensure warning signs flash up telling internet users that material they are trying to access is against the law. He threatened legislation unless there is significant progress by October.

‘If people enter into a Google search a truly disgusting term, something that’s so obvious that the searcher is looking for illegal child abuse images, my view – and I think the view of parents up and down the country – is that the internet company shouldn’t return any results,’ he said.

‘At the moment they’re saying they should. They’re saying it’s a matter of free speech. I’m saying look, it isn’t about free speech, these images are illegal, you shouldn’t enable people who are deliberately searching for them.’ 

In a speech at the NSPCC in London, Mr Cameron said family-friendly filters would be automatically selected by providers for all new broadband customers by the end of the year – although they will be able to choose to switch them off.

Millions of existing computer users will be contacted by the end of next year and told they must decide whether or not to use ‘family-friendly filters’ to restrict adult material. The filters will apply to all devices linked to a home wi-fi network.

Customers who do not click on either option – accepting or declining – will have filters activated by default.

Asked if the opt-in system would mean a husband having to confess to his partner if he wanted to look at porn, Mr Cameron told Radio 5 Live: ‘If an adult wants to get rid of the filter on their computer, that’s up to them.’

Pressed on the issue, the Prime Minister eventually conceded: ‘Yes, it does.’ 

He said he would be installing internet filters in his own home, adding: ‘You’re always a few clicks away from something you shouldn’t see.’

A Google spokesman said: ‘We have a zero tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery. We use our own systems and work with child safety experts to find it, remove and report it.

'We recently donated $5m (£3.3m) to groups working to combat this problem and are committed to continuing the dialogue with the Government on these issues.’ 

Dido Harding, chief executive of TalkTalk, said: ‘We take our responsibility very seriously and that is why we are now contacting our existing customers to ask them if they want to use [family-friendly filter] HomeSafe, and we will be pre-ticking HomeSafe as on for new customers from the end of the year. 

‘One in three customers are choosing to turn on parental controls when offered the chance.’ 

But Padraig Reidy of the Index on Censorship warned: ‘Sites about sexual health, about sexuality and so on, will get caught up in the same filters as pornography. It will really restrict people’s experience on the web, including children’s.’

Geoffrey Bettley: Child porn photos

Teachers caught with images of child abuse will be banned automatically from classrooms, the Department for Education says.

Previously, some school staff found to have child porn were allowed to continue working.

The new guidance says ‘any criminal conviction or caution that involves indecent images of children’ should lead to an indefinite ban.

Any sexual misconduct, not just ‘serious sexual misconduct’, should trigger a ban, it says.

This would include behaviour that is not illegal but does bring the teacher’s conduct into question.

The new rules follow the revelation last month that religious education teacher Geoffrey Bettley was given the go-ahead to pursue his career despite being found to have downloaded almost 200 photos of child porn.

Bettley, 36, was suspended from from St Mary’s Catholic School in Menston, West Yorkshire, in December 2010 after his arrest.

He accepted a police caution and was dismissed by the school.

But a professional conduct panel said he should be allowed to apply for work in other schools as he ‘does not represent a risk to children’.

Paedophile Thomas Owen, 33, from Wallasey, Merseyside, who amassed the largest collection of child porn images ever seized in Britain – more than 3.5million – was jailed for seven years yesterday at Liverpool  Crown Court.
