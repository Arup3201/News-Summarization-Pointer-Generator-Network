Comeback: Andrew Marr is to return to television, nine months after suffering a stroke

Looking relaxed, Andrew Marr briefly returns to his  own Sunday programme today doing what he does best – grilling politicians.

The 53-year-old broadcaster will make his first appearance  on the show as interviewer since he had a stroke six months ago.

He questions former Labour Foreign Secretary David Miliband in what is the ex-MP’s last interview before he moves to New York to become chief executive of the charity International Rescue Committee.

In the pre-recorded ten-minute slot, Mr Marr grills Mr Miliband on Syria and on whether it is right for the Egyptian military to have imprisoned ousted President Morsi.

Mr Marr will return to the show full time in September.

'You have to take it bit by bit and I always wanted to come back in the autumn as it’s the natural beginning of the political year,' said Marr. 'But I also felt that I’m thinking and talking fine. My walking is a bit wobbly, but so what?'

He briefly appeared as a guest on the show in April, but his return to interviewing shows a remarkable – and continuing – recovery only nine months after he tore the carotid artery while exercising on a rowing machine in his garden shed.

He said his return to the interviewer’s chair 'felt really good and really natural'.

It will be Miliband’s final interview before the former MP flies to New York to start his new role as chief executive of the charity International Rescue Committee.

'This is the first of my padding steps back to full-time,' said Marr. 'I’m really looking forward to getting back full-time for the new political season.'

The 53-year-old journalist has no shortage of work in the pipeline: he is filming a documentary on German chancellor Angela Merkel next week and has lined up another 'big interview' this side of the summer – although he declined to reveal who will face his questions.

Marr has described how he was struck by 'a blinding headache and flashes of light'.

He woke up the next morning lying on his bedroom floor, unable to move, after suffering a serious stroke overnight.

He was paralysed down his left side but the area of the brain that controls speech and memory was unaffected. His appetite for reading and writing, too, is undimmed.

He recently finished writing the first draft of a novel with the help of a computerised dictation system, and has also worked on an updated book on Scottish politics and another on his love of drawing.

In an interview with the Daily Mail this month, Marr described how he was living a 'brittle, narrow, overstressed life' before his stroke and said he was a happier 'and slightly nicer' person than before the incident.

'I had been doing too much, too quickly. I lived life at a hurtle, like a vehicle out of control, ricocheting against everyone around me,' he said.

Patrick Olszowski, campaigns and policy manager at the charity Stroke Association, said Marr’s recovery would provide inspiration to the one million people living with the aftermath of the condition in the UK.

'I would totally applaud Andrew Marr for his fortitude,' he said.

'What stroke survivors want more than anything else is hope that their life is not over,' he added.

'For Andrew Marr it might be about getting back to work, but for someone who has had an even more serious stroke it might just be to pick their kids up from school or open one eye or give their wife a cuddle.

'A lot of people can go on to make very striking contributions to the world after having a stroke.'
