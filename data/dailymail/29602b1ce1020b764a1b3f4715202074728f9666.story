An 88-year-old Missouri man has pleaded guilty in the stabbing death of his ailing 86-year-old wife last year.

Donald Rowland pleaded guilty in Boone County Circuit Court Monday to first-degree involuntary manslaughter. His sentencing has been scheduled for April 13.

Rowland was originally charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the death of his wife, Betty Rowland, but prosecutors reduced those charges last month.

Authorities have said an adult daughter called police after going to the couple's home in Columbia in October 2014 and finding her parents together in bed, both with stab wounds.

Police say Rowland told officers he killed his wife and tried to take his own life, because he didn't want them to be a burden on their family.

A neighbor told the Columbia Daily Tribune that Betty Rowland had recently had a stroke.

Appearing in court Monday in a striped jail garb and accompanied by his attorney, Rowland only answered 'yes' and 'no' in response to Judge Kevin Crane's questions.

Prosecutor Merilee Crockett recommended seven years in prison for the octogenarian defendant. 

At around 12.20pm on October 31, 2014, Betty and Donald Rowland's grown daughter stopped by her parents' condominium in the 3400 block of Woodrail Terrace to check up on them and discovered the couple wounded in bed.

Mrs Rowland suffered two fatal stab wounds to the chest and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her husband of 64 years was taken to University Hospital with self-inflicted injuries, according to a probable cause affidavit. 

Betty Montgomery married Donald Rowland, her college sweetheart, in 1950, and the two went on to have four children, 13 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

Mrs Rowland, a music teacher by trade, followed her husband, a career military officer in the US Air Force, when he was posted to Yokota Air Base in Japan, where she taught piano to military personnel.

When she was not giving music lessons and singing in a choir, the mother of four acted as a Brownie and Girl Scout leader, a PTA officer and was involved in charity work.
