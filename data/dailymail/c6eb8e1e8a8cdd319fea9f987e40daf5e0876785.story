Two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson believes he can freewheel at Augusta this year because all the pressure will be heaped on Rory McIlroy as he goes for the career grand slam.

Watson failed miserably the last time he was in the limelight as defending champion, only just making the halfway cut at Augusta in 2013. 

But the big-hitting American is convinced he can live up to his status as one of the favourites this time because all the attention next month will be focussed on the Northern Irishman.

Watson insists that Rory McIlroy will be under more pressure than himself at the Masters

The world No 1 only needs an Masters crown to complete a full set of grand slams

‘There’s no pressure on me because I have two green jackets already, but it will be different for Rory,’ he said. 

‘To be going for the career grand slam and at such a young age as well, if that was me in his shoes I would consider myself under a lot of pressure because who would not want to complete that? I think the key for Rory will be to try to look at it from an achievement standpoint rather than a pressure situation – that he’s there because of the amazing feat of winning three of the four majors at aged 25. 

'He can also think to himself that if it doesn’t work out this year, then at least he is going to have plenty more tries in years to come.’

Like McIlroy, Watson will complete his pre-Masters tournament preparations at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, which begins at Bay Hill in Orlando on Thursday. And the gifted leftie was full of praise for the world number one, predicting he will break many golfing records in years to come.

‘What was I doing at 25? Just trying to keep hold of my PGA Tour card,’ he said. 

‘And yet here’s Rory with all these tournaments he’s won already. With the talent he has, there are plenty of records he could beat as he gets older.’

Watson, of course, is not exactly short of talent himself. Twelve months on, people still talk about the pivotal drive he hit at the par five 13th during the final round at Augusta last year, that cleared the corner to set up victory – a carry of a mere 360 yards.

‘I did push it a bit,’ admitted the gifted leftie.

‘Lucky for me I hit it well and so it carried all the trouble, and I had just a sand wedge for my second shot and made birdie.’ 

Golf legend Jack Nicklaus holds the record with six Masters wins, the last coming in 1986 (above)

He admits a touch of sadness that his second stint as Masters champ is coming to a close. 

‘Anytime you can look forward to Augusta and you’re selecting the menu at the champions dinner as the defending champion, that’s a special time in the game of golf,’ he said. 

‘My juices will be flowing, that’s for sure. I’m 36 now and sometimes feel old when you look at some of players on tour. But I’ll feel like a kid again when I get to Augusta. I always do.’
