The starry eyed sister said she was now 'definitely expecting a call from Pope Francis'

The previous record holder was the unforgettable Gangnam Style by Korean pop star Psy which racked up 10-million views in 18 days, before going on to reach almost 2-billion clicks.

When Sister Cristina gave her rendition of the U.S. star’s hit No One the first judge to turn around was tattooed Italian rapper J-Ax.

His jaw dropped when he saw where the heavenly voice had come from.

He later joked: ‘If I'd had a nun like you at Sunday school I'd be pope now.’

The bad boy judge swiftly recruited her for his team saying: ‘We'd be unbeatable together, the Devil and Holy Water. ‘.

'Are you a real nun?', another visibly amazed judge asked Sister Cristina.

She insisted: 'Very real indeed. I have a gift and I've come to give it to you.'

Shock: 'Are you a real nun?', another visibly amazed judge asked Sister Cristina

The starry eyed sister said she was now 'definitely expecting a call from Pope Francis'.

The idea is not as far fetched as one might think, given the pontiff’s habit for making phone calls to parishioners and nuns.

Cristina, who grew up in a small town outside Palermo, got her first taste of stardom aged 17 when she was offered the starring role in a musical put on by an order of nuns about their founder St Ursula.

The UK version of The Voice has the judges Ricky Wilson, Sir Tom Jones, Will.i.am and Kylie Minogue

'It all started off as a bit of fun, getting into the role, but as every performance went by I realised that my life was changing,' she told an Italian magazine.The next year she became a novice and took her holy orders two years ago, while continuing to take signing and dancing classes. She also auditioned for X-factor.

Sister Cristina claims that her musical antics are in line with Francis' pastoral recommendation for priests to reach out to people in the street.

'Who said that a nun cannot perform? It gives out a strong signal if a young woman who has consecrated her life to God continues to do things that any person of my age would do,' Cristina was quoted as saying by Italian newspaper La Repubblica.

The audition, which aired a week ago, attracted 13 million views on the You Tube website in the first three days.

Gangnam Style remains the most watched YouTube video ever.

But when it was first published, it took 18 days - rather than three - to pass the 10-million-hits mark.

Sing it, sister Christina!' the U.S. singer posted on Twitter, along with a link to the nun's video.Whoopi Goldberg, who played a pop star who seeks refuge by disguising herself a a nun in the film Sister Act, also lent her support tweeting the link to the video and writing: 'For when you want a taste of sister act!'
