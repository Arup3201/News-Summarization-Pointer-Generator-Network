Hordes of motorcyclists swarmed the avenues of Paris today in protest at a proposed ban on older motorbikes on the city's streets.

Despite a ban against the protest by police in the French capital, hundreds of bikers rode through the city, many carrying posters declaring 'Je suis biker' or 'Je suis motard'.

They are furious at a proposal to ban motorcycles made before 2000 from the city's streets, a move the municipal government insists will lessen Paris's stifling air pollution.

Motorcyclists' groups in the country have hit back, claiming that they can cover more distance in less time than four-wheeled vehicles and can help to reduce traffic congestion.

The French Federation of Angry Bikers (FFMC), one of France's largest and most active motorcyclist rights lobby groups, organised today's protest against the ban.

Defending motorcycles, the FFMC said in a statement that 'because of their low fuel consumption, reduced size, mobility and shorter journey times, they are a solution to the congestion of urban traffic and of value in the fight against pollution.

'While other European cities have, quite logically, not included motorised two wheelers in this restriction, the city of Paris still wants to penalise users whose negative impact in terms of pollution is marginal.'

One of a number of efforts the city government is making to improve air quality in Paris, the plan also includes measures to encourage motorists to join in the effort, including 0 per cent interest loans for new vehicles, building more electric charging stations and slashing parking fees for greener vehicles.

The proposal on motorbikes is set to go before the local council tomorrow, when a second rally is planned by motorcyclists in front of Paris's city hall.
