More secrets have emerged from the diary of RFK Jr including that he found aspects of family life so excruciating that he had to escape. 

Another batch of excerpts from Kennedy's stolen diary, published in The New York Post today, revealed that a mall shopping trip with his wife Mary and children was a 'nightmare'.

The diary from 2001 is jam-packed with Kennedy's encounters with the higher echelons of politics and the celebrity circuit.

Celebrity friends: Robert F. Kennedy Jr and actor Leonardo DiCaprio once discussed environmental issues over dinner

In one story he tells how Leonardo Di Caprio came for dinner to discuss environmental issues and his son asked if the actor was a girl because of his long hair. He added that the A-lister was 'very sweet'. 

In another encounter noted down in the diary, this time with Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld star Larry David, the comedian told Kennedy: 'The Davids are antithetical to the 
Kennedys. With the exception of politics, we have nothing in common.

'We 
are appalled by the things you do, the way you people live your lives.'

Despite at one point, gushing 'I’ve got the best family ever', RFK also notes points when he is frustrated with the banality of it all.

According to the Post, he wrote: 'I’m embarrassed to say we went to a mall
today with the kids and Mary.

'I tried to be 
stand-up about the experience. But it was one of the worst nightmares of
my existence... the kids turned into savages. I had to leave.'

In 2001, Mary Kennedy and Robert had had their fourth child and living at the family estate in Westchester.

However the marriage was already crumbling with RFK Jr noting the names of 37 women in his diary that year with apparently scores out of ten next to their names.

Mary Kennedy, who had drug and alcohol problems along with depression, committed suicide in May 2012 in the midst of a bitter divorce battle.

Kennedy's diary is also littered with glamorous parties and dinners that come with the rarefied life of being born a Kennedy.

RFK Jr wrote that George W. Bush asked him and his wife Mary to dinner shortly after he was elected President.

A 2001 diary belonging to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , pictured with late wife Mary, has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that she gave birth to their fourth child

Kennedy, who comes from a long-line of Democrats, debated whether it was a good idea to go to a Republican White House. He later described Bush as a 'simpleton' following the 9/11 attacks.

He also writes that Alec Baldwin called him for advice during his acrimonious divorce from Kim Basinger.

Kennedy, a renowned conservationist, also notes his trips in a private Cessna to various glamorous parties.

He describes how he flew from Cape Cod 
to the Hamptons in August 2001 to go to a party thrown by socialite Anne Hearst - although complained that the party was 'a show, a scene'.

Kennedy has put out a statement condemning publication of the diary but confirming that they did in fact come from him. 

'The New York Post has chosen to print 
excerpts from a 13-year-old diary illegally stolen from me,' he said in a
statement to the paper.

'Creepy': RFK Jr was in jail with Rev. Al Sharpton (left) and the wife of Rev. Jesse Jackson (right), and he wrote disparagingly about the two black civil rights leaders

In previous explosive revelations, it was revealed that Kennedy wrote that Reverends
Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton 'give me the creeps' and that their 
obvious agendas did a disservice to their political goals.

The
revelations come on top of his admissions about 'lust demons' that 
drove him to cheat on his wife Mary, who killed herself last year just 
days after he filed for divorce.

'The diary served as a tool for self-examination and for dealing with my spiritual struggles at the time. It also contains unedited, unfiltered stream-of-consciousness musings about current events and people.’

Those newsworthy people included a number of politicians from his own party - and even his own family.

At the time that the diary was written, Kennedy's sister Kerry was married to Andrew Cuomo when he was the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Family: At the time the journal was written, Robert's sister Kerry (left, see in 1990) was married to Andrew Cuomo (right), who was then worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development but was mulling a gubernatorial run

When Andrew came to his then-brother-in-law for advice about a possible gubernatorial run- hoping to follow in his father Mario's footsteps.

In the journal, Robert wrote that Cuomo could win due to his energy and focus, but 'he could lose because he lacks humanity and doesn't love people'.

Ends up that Robert was right at the time since Cuomo's 2002 bid for governor failed but he went on to win in 2010.

That wasn't the only entry where 
Kennedy weighed in on the Cuomo family's legal skills, as then-retired 
Governor Mario helped try to get Kennedy out of a jail sentence after he
and several other activists were arrested during a demonstration in 
Vieques, Puerto Rico.

Kennedy was jailed alongside Reverend Al Sharpton and the wife of Jesse Jackson.

During
lock up, he apparently had plenty of time to critique his fellow 
Democrats, saying that Sharpton 'has done more damage to the black 
cause' than segregationist governors in the south who prevented school 
integration.

'(Sharpton's) transparent venal blackmail and extortion schemes taint all black leadership,' Kennedy wrote.

Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail alongside Rev. Al Sharpton in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Navy training facility.

Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside last year with their children, writes in his diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her

Jackson wasn't spared sharp criticism either, as Kennedy wrote that he had 'a desperate and destructive addiction to publicity'.

'I feel dirty around him, and I feel like I’m being used. I feel like with Jesse, it’s all about Jesse,' he added.

The timing of the journal means that it included the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. As a result, he included some withering reviews of the Republican response.

He wrote that President George Bush was 'an idiot and a puppet' and New York City's then-mayor Rudy Giuliani was a 'little despot' who was 'desperate' to hold on to his position of power.

Kennedy wrote that he had his own 
power control issues, as he made startling admissions of his own 
feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife.

‘I’m
like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. 
But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on November  5, 2001.

On days when he doesn’t cheat, Kennedy writes ‘victory’ to signify that he resisted sexual temptation.

He
even used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ 
to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a 
mark out of ten.

The list 
contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside 
them - which is believed to have signified that they had full 
intercourse.
