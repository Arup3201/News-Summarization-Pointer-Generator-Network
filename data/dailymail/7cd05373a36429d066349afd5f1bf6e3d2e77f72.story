The Guardian newspaper allowed British agents spies into its London offices to oversee destruction of leaked NSA data after the government threatened legal action.

The newspaper's editor Alan Rusbridger claimed in an 
opinion piece published on the Guardian's website that a pair of
staffers from British eavesdropping agency GCHQ monitored the hard drives being destroyed.

Shortly
after his paper began publishing reports based on Snowden's leaks, he 
said he was contacted by 'a very senior government official claiming to 
represent the views of the prime minister' who demanded the return or 
destruction of Snowden's material.

Claims: 'Shadowy' Government figures were sent in to destroy hard drives owned by the Guardian, the newspaper's editor has revealed

Mr Rusbridger said dialogue with 
officials started around two months ago, before their 'mood toughened' 
around a month ago, when he claims he 'received a phone call from the 
centre of government telling me: 'You've had your fun. Now we want the 
stuff back'.'

He revealed he held a series of meetings with 'shadowy Whitehall figures', in which he was asked to destroy all Edward Snowden related material.

Eventually, he said, officials threatened legal action, and that's when the editor allowed British agents into his basement.

He adds that he told the official he intended to publish the material abroad, should the government seek to stifle them using legal routes, before hardware was destroyed at the newspapers basement.

'And so one of the more bizarre moments in the Guardian's long history occurred - with two GCHQ security experts overseeing the destruction of hard drives in the Guardian's basement just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could possibly be of any interest to passing Chinese agents. "We can call off the black helicopters" joked one as we swept up the remains of a MacBook Pro.'

The revelations come a day after David 
Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald - who 
interviewed American whistle-blower Edward Snowden - was held and 
questioned at Heathrow Airport for nine hours, under Schedule 7 of the 
Terrorism Act 2000.

Today Theresa May revealed she was briefed in advance of the possible detention of Mr Miranda at Heathrow Airport.

But the Home Secretary said that it was not for her to tell the police who they should or should not stop at ports, or who they should arrest.

She said: 'If it is believed that somebody has in their possession highly sensitive stolen information which could help terrorists, which could lead to a loss of lives, then it is right that the police act and that is what the law enables them to do.'

Mr Rusbridger warns 'it may not be long before it will be impossible for journalists to have confidential sources'.

However, he points out that the Guardian will continue to make use of reporting from other, more 'permissive legal environments'.

Rusbridger said the destruction was the culmination of weeks of pressure on the Guardian by British officials.

It was not clear exactly when the 
incident occurred. Rusbridger gave a vague timeline, suggesting that it happened within the past month or so.

Snowden's leaks - published in the Guardian, The Washington Post, and other publications - have exposed the details of the United States' global surveillance apparatus, sparking an international debate over the limits of American spying.

And as politicians debate reforms and civil liberties group go to court, journalists have been wrestling with the implications of mass surveillance.

Rusbridger said Monday that the spies were growing so powerful 'it may not be long before it will be impossible for journalists to have confidential sources.' 

A spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron declined comment.

The Guardian has been forced to succumb to legal pressure in the past - Sarah Tisdall, a young Foreign Office clerk, was sent to prison for leaking details of 1983 cruise missile deployment plans to the newspaper.

She anonymously sent The Guardian photocopied documents detailing when American cruise missile nuclear weapons would be arriving in the United Kingdom.

Despite a legal battle the newspaper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents, which were identified as coming from an FCO photocopying machine, and ultimately identifying Sarah Tisdall.
