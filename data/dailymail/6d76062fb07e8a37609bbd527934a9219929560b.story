A hardware store worker has been found guilty of ejaculating in his female colleague's coffee in a bid to get noticed. 

John R. Lind, 34, admitted on Thursday to tainting Pat Maahs' drink with his semen while they worked together at Beisswenger’s hardware store in New Brighton, Minnesota.

Ramsey County District Court heard that he masturbated over her desk multiple times while she was away.

Initially, Maahs thought the coffee smelled bad because the milk in the office was spoiled.

She told the Minneapolis Star Tribune: 'I’m glad he’s getting something, because I believe he deserves some punishment. So far, my sentence is greater than his. 

Lind pleaded guilty to indecent exposure, defined as engaging in lewd or indecent behavior.

He will be sentenced for the misdemeanor on May 22. 

The case led to Maahs proposing legislation that would make such an act a felony. 

She added: 'I felt that there was a hole in the law, and it needed to be plugged, and it was up to me to do it because no one else was going to do it for me.'
