It has survived the onslaught of apps that turn a smartphone into an e-reader. But a new device is set to take on the Kindle by offering similar features.

One of the main reasons people also buy a Kindle is 
because of its e-ink display - its low-power meaning it lasts much 
longer than a phone, and its anti-glare screen means it can be read in 
bright light.

Now, a new phone case with a flexible e-ink display adds a second screen to 
an iPhone 5 or 5S - doing away with the need for both gadgets.

popSLATE's creators believe their case is an alternative for an eReader thanks to its anti-glare e-ink screen that can be read in bright sunlight. But they also point out that it also has features that a Kindle does not

The
screen can be used to read books in bright sunlight, but it also 
connects to and 'mirrors' the phone's main screen - showing 
notifications, photos or anything else that the main screen can show.

The Popslate screen also uses less battery than the phone's display, too, and because it is 
called 'always on', which means it doesn't timeout, it is a simpler and 
more energy-efficient way to watch videos, for example. 

The clever case, which is available to pre-order via the company's website costs $129 (£81), or $149 (£94) when shipped to the UK.

The company says its case 'enables bookworms to forgo carrying a Kindle' because text can be displayed on the back of their iPhone.

Pages are turned by double-tapping the case, which contains a 'tactile interface' controlled by the handset's accelerometer.

Just like Amazon's e-reader, the Popslate case only uses power when the text or images changes and the e-ink screen is anti-glare and can be read in direct sunlight.

The company claims the case can be used as an energy-saving measure so users can see urgent notifications, maps, notes or their calender without having to constantly turn their iPhone on and off, which can be useful if a handset is almost out of battery.

Always On: The screen can display virtually anything and because it uses e-ink technology, it can be kept for long periods of time without using much energy

When they first started out, Greg Moon and Yasha Behzadi wanted their product to be able to add some creative edge to the ubiquitous iPhone.

They originally built it simply as a way to display pictures and give iPhone users a way to personalise their phones.

But after testing, they worked out that they could do a lot more with the case and decided to add more practical features. 

But what makes this product so practical is that it uses e-ink technology, which only requires minimal power to stay on.

The phone case, which turns the back of an iPhone into a second screen, is avauilable to pre-order in two colours for $129 and its creators said an iPad version might be released in the future

So while notifications on the main iPhone screen will disappear after minutes, those on the Popslate will not, which makes the second screen more useful for lengthy tasks.

The device is designed to be user-friendly and mimic the iPhone's features, as well as getting its power from the iPhone without having to charge it separately.

Popslate partnered with Plastic Logic, experts in flexible display technology, to make the 'shatterproof' second screen.

It uses Plastic Logic's OTFT (organic thin film transistor) backplane display technology and the screen is called electrophoretic because it moves fluid around an electric field. 

The designers are now looking into making a larger version of Popslate for the iPad as well as whether a dedicated reading app can be developed for the case to make full use of its e-ink screen.

The case itself is 'ruggedised' so as well as being an extra screen, the company claims it is 'nearly indestructable' and still protects the phone.

The phone used crowd-funding website IndieGoGo to raise $219,417; exceeding its goal of $150,000.
