Joanne Scott, who poured milk over a distressed baby's face and said 'that's for throwing up on me', a hearing was told

A midwife poured milk over a distressed baby's face and said 'that's for throwing up on me', a hearing was told today.

Joanne Scott also photographed the child on her mobile phone because her husband and daughter would 'find it funny', it is claimed.

Scott was working a night shift at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in 2008 when the baby became unsettled.

She went over to calm it down but then took a photograph, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

Derek Zeitlin, for the NMC, said: 'When questioned about it by her colleague, told her that she would send it to her husband and her daughter who would find it funny.

'The baby was in quite an unsettled state and the registrant took the baby rather roughly in her hands and as a result of that the baby was sick over her.

'Scott's colleague put the baby back and remonstrated with the registrant about the rough handling and took the baby in her arms.

'The registrant went away and came back with a bottle of milk which her colleague saw without a teat on it.

'Scott poured that over the baby, saying "that's for throwing up on me."'

The other member of staff was at first afraid to say anything as she was a junior and only reported the incident a few months later.

Scott is also accused of swearing at the husband of a woman giving birth on October 11, 2010. The midwife had previously sent the mother home after claiming that she was not in labour.

Mr Zeitlin continued: 'The upshot of that was that when the mother did eventually give birth she did so in the ambulance taking her back to the hospital.

'Her husband was with her at the time and he was very scared as to what was going on.

'When they arrived at the hospital there was a conversation which took place between the father and the registrant, part of which was overheard by a colleague.

'The father explained that he was very scared and she had no idea why he was scared because she had explained what he had to do when they got home.

'She made the comment "did you nearly sh*t yourself" and after a reply by him, "that is because you're f***ing useless."'

The same month Scott breached professional boundaries by befriending on Facebook a mother who had just given birth at the hospital, it is claimed.

On 18 October 2010 Scott used her mobile phone to take a photo of another baby, referred to as Baby C, when there was specialist camera equipment available, it is alleged.

Baby C was suffering from a condition that meant it was half one colour and half another and Scott claimed she had to show the paediatrician.

But the midwife did not get consent from the mother and did not write any notes in the medical records about showing the photo to a paediatrician.

The photo was then not deleted in a 'prompt manner' from her mobile phone.

The midwife admits adding a mother as a friend on Facebook and all charges against her relating to Baby C.

She also admits swearing at the husband of a mother in labour once but denies saying 'that's because you're f***ing useless'.

Scott denies all the other charges and claims her fitness to practice has not been impaired. If found guilty of misconduct she could be thrown out of the profession. The hearing continues.
