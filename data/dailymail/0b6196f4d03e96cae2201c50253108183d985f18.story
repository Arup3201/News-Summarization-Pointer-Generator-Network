This is the dramatic moment a Dynamo Kiev footballer was saved from swallowing his tongue by a quick-thinking opposition player.

Oleg Gusev, 30, was knocked unconscious after competing for a cross with Dnipro goalkeeper, Denys Boyko, during a Ukrainian Premier League match in Dnipropetrovsk.

He received a blow to the face from Boyko's knee - causing him to fall to the ground with a severe risk of swallowing his tongue.

Quick-thinking: Dnipro midfielder, Jaba Kankava, is pictured saving the life of Dynamo Kiev captain, Oleg Gusev, by forcing his hand down his throat and clearing his airways during a Ukrainian Premier League match 

But
 he was saved after Dnipro midefielder, Jaba Kankava, rushed over and 
forced his hand down his throat to clear his airways in a 
potentially life-saving move.

Medical officials soon joined the 
throng of players trying to save the Dynamo Kiev captain, who transferred to the club in the summer of 2003.

Seconds later, he could be seen regaining consciousness -  kicking and rolling around, before eventually calming down.

The
 crowd, who had been shocked into silence following the collision, burst
 into applause as Gusev left the field on a stretcher.

fast acting bravery.

Gusev was later spotted on the touchline in a fit state of health, according to reports.

However, the club has not yet given an update on his condition.
