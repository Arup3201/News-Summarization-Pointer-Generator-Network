After indulging in a three-month nap, it is unsurprising that one of the world's largest crocs might wake up a little peckish.

Emerging from hibernation at Wild Life Sydney Zoo in Darling Harbour, one of the city zoo's most ferocious inhabitants attracted attention as he gorged on his first feast of the summer.

Rex, one of the world's largest crocodiles, burst from the water at the zoo's Kakadu Gorge enclosure to snap his giant jaws around the carcass of a dead chicken.

'Ultimate killing machine': Waking up from three months in hibernation, Sydney Zoo's resident saltwater crocodile Rex, was ready for his first feast of the summer

Snap happy: Bursting from the water, thrashing his powerful tail, the five-metre crocodile leapt for the dead bird

Exploding through the surface, thrashing his powerful tail, Rex devoured the bird dragging it down to the water mimicking the technique used in the wild to drown prey.

Devouring the bird in one sharp bite, the predatory saltwater croc, revealed why his kind are considered one of 'nature's ultimate killing machines'.

The saltwater species or estuarine crocodile is the world's largest of all crocs and there are thought to be between 200,000 and 300,000 living in the wild.

They are not thought to be at risk of extinction but illegal hunting and habitat loss has put pressure on the population.Â 

Giant predator: Rex, a saltwater croc, is one of the world's largest. There are thought to be between 200,000 and 300,000 of the species living in the wild throughout parts of India, southeast Asia and northern Australia

More likely than their reptilian peers to eat a human, the giant beasts reach an average of five-metres and 450kgs, but males reaching seven-metres and weighing 1,000kg are not uncommon.

Rex's home at Sydney Zoo's Kakadu Gorge enclosure aims to replicate the diverse eco-system where these creatures thrive in the wild in eastern India, southeast Asia and northern Australia.

In the wild the competent swimmers are often spotted far out at sea. The opportunistic predators lurk beneath the surface close to the shoreline waiting for their next meal to stop for a drink.

While Rex, who weighs 700kg, is partial to a chicken, the saltwater croc will eat anything it can get its jaws around, from water buffalo to monkeys, wild boar and even sharks.
