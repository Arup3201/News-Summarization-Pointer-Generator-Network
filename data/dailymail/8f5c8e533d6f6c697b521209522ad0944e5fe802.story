'Outrageous': Google CEO Eric Schmidt has blasted government over allegations of tapping

Google's chief executive Eric Schmidt has blasted the US government's spying on data centres as outrageous and illegal if true.

The media mogul's comments came after reports emerged last week claiming officials had tapped into Google servers to access data in email accounts.

It is the latest in a fresh string of allegations launched against America's National Security Agency (NSA) this month.

Leaks including news that America has been tapping Angela Merkel's phone have put the nation at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.

'It's really outrageous that the NSA was looking between the Google data centers, if that's true,' Mr Schmidt said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.

'The steps that the organization was willing to do without good judgment to pursue its mission and potentially violate people's privacy, it's not OK.'

The NSA has allegedly collected the phone records of 320million people in order to identify roughly 300 people who might be at risk of intrusion, the CEO revealed.

Mr Schmidt said: 'It's just bad public policy and perhaps illegal.'

He added that Google had registered complaints with the NSA, President Barack Obama and Congress members.

However, the NSA has declared that the report 'is not true'.

Leak: Last week it was reported that the NSA tapped into Google and Yahoo servers to access email data

'I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers,' NSA Director General Keith Alexander said at a conference last week. 'We go through a court order.'

News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.

Dismissing the latest revelation, the NSA referred again to its previous statements.

Controversy: Former NSA worker Edward Snowden has leaked a tumult of data about the agency's operations

Meanwhile, US officials are on a push to regain the trust of the international community and top businesses like Google and Yahoo - which was also allegedly tapped.

The US Senate Intelligence Committee approved legislation on Thursday that would tighten controls on the government's sweeping electronic eavesdropping programs - but critics attacked the move that will allow them to continue.

On Friday, John Kerry indicated a softening of the U.Sâ€™s defensive stance on its surveillance programmes, admitting that on occasions its spying has â€˜reached too far inappropriatelyâ€™.
