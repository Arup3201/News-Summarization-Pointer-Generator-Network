A British father, his partner and two children, including a six-week-old baby, have been found stabbed to death in a suspected murder-suicide in Gilbraltar.

The 31-year-old man, who is reportedly from Liverpool, and the 37-year-old Spanish woman were found dead this morning, alongside a four-year-old Spanish girl and the baby.

It is understood that all four were found with stab wounds, while the woman and the girls reportedly had their necks slashed.

Police on the British enclave say they are not currently looking for any suspects in connection with the deaths.

The family, who have been identified by police but have not yet been named, were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am. 

Spanish media reported that they had been living in Spain and had only arrived in Gibraltar a few days earlier. 

Police confirmed the man was of British nationality while the women had Spanish nationality but was originally from Cuba.

Local newspapers reported that the man was from Liverpool and that the four-year-old girl was the woman's daughter from a previous relationship, while the baby girl had been born in Spain. 

Police were called to the scene at 11am after a member of the company which owns the property went to the flat.

The person did not get any response from knocking on the door but noticed that the property was locked from the inside, police said.  

Spanish newspaper El Mundo quoted police sources saying the door to the flat had not been forced and the three females all had cuts to their necks.

A major police investigation has now been launched and detectives and forensic officers are working in the flat while the area remains cordoned off.  

Chief Minister Fabian Picardo tonight led a minute's silence at the Parliament of Gibraltar following the horrific news.

He said until the police have completed their investigation, the Government can't comment any further.

But he added: 'As a husband and father, I'm shocked by this terrible crime, as, I am sure, are all residents of Gibraltar.

'Gibraltarians aren't used to these types of events in our peaceful community, respectful of the law.

'Words are not enough in moments such as this and all we can do is keep the victims and their families in our thoughts and trust that justice will prevail.'  

The family had reportedly been living in Spain and had only recently arrived in Gibraltar to visit a family friend

Police spokesman Superintendent Richard Ullger said tonight: 'We are trying to contact close relatives and for that reason we cannot give out any names. 

'But I can tell you that the man came from the United Kingdom and the woman had Spanish nationality and was of Cuban extraction. The four year old also had Spanish nationality.' 

He added: 'The deaths are not natural deaths and we are carrying out a major investigation lead by Acting Superintendent Wayne Tunbridge from the Serious Crime Unit.

'Police found the bodies after responding to a call from a member of the public. At the moment we are still investigating the relationship between the four people and the circumstances of their deaths.

'A Home Office pathologist and a specialist paediatric pathologist will fly out to carry out the autopsies. We are not looking for anyone else at this stage.

'We are still trying to reach some family members and won't be revealing the identities until the next of kin have been informed. We are not speculating on the cause of deaths.'   

Police on the British enclave on the Iberian Peninsula are not searching for any suspects in the stabbing

A spokesman for the Royal Gibraltar Police also described how the force had been alerted to the incident.

They said: 'A member of staff of the company that was letting out the flat, which is a rental property, attended the residence.

'They got no answer from within but noticed that the house was locked from inside and that sent a few alarm bells ringing and they decided to call the police.

'At the moment what we are doing is trying to get as much background information from both the Spanish and the UK sides of the family.'

None of the deceased are thought to have been known to police or social services in Gibraltar.

The spokesman added: 'These people had only been in Gibraltar for a few days, I think it was either last Thursday or Friday that they arrived.

'We are trying to discover if they were here in transit to the UK or whether they were planning on staying for any length of time in Gibraltar.'

A Home Office forensic pathologist is expected to travel to Gibraltar in the next couple of days to perform post-mortem examinations on the bodies. 

The Commissioner of Police Eddie Yome also described today's tragedy as a 'unique event for Gibraltar'.
