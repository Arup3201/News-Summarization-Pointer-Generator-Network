The brave efforts of a small dog is being credited with saving the lives of two Oscoda County, Colorado men.

A 4lb dachshund named Bradley died of wounds suffered while standing up to a 400 lb black bear and fought it off so it wouldn't attack his human friends.

'I believe honestly the outcome would've been different if Brad had not been with him,' John Force, Bradley's owner said. 'If the bear had attacked Brad, It certainly would've attacked the men who were bigger than Brad.'

Saturday afternoon, a group of friends visiting the Force residence ventured into the woods and took Bradley along for the ride.

'They came across the mama and her cubs on the trail and they were a bit surprised, none of them had ever seen a bear before,'Force said.

The large bear stared the men down. They instantly knew they were in trouble. But they didn't realize they already had protection by their side.

'Brad jumped off the golf cart and attacked the big bear, they got into a scuffle,' Force said.

After the bear released Bradley, he ran 
back to the men. Unfortunately, the bite wounds were too severe and an 
hour later Bradley died.

'He was only four to five pounds, but in his mind I think he thought he was 100 lbs,' said Bradley's owner, Lisa Force.

Lisa Force (pictured) referred to her dog Bradley as 'a little fighter' and said, 'I would expect him to protect me before the rottweilers probably'

'The force family says this small
 wiener dog had a history of being fearless and even though they have 
two dogs that are much larger than Bradley.

'I would expect him to protect me before the rottweilers probably,' Lisa Force said.

They are glad he was the one tasked with saving their friends lives.

'I think he would went out the way he wanted to go out you know he was a little fighter a little scrapper and he didn't think twice about attacking a bear I guarantee you, he would have did it again,' John Force said.
