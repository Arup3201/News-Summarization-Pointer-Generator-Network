Britons might consider a congested stretch of motorway with mile-long tailbacks as a hellish road.

But a map showing the world’s most deadly stretches of highway makes the M25 look tame in comparison.

From cliff-top single track roads with deadly drops in Pakistan to highways renowned for their bandits in Mexico, an interactive map includes ‘fear factor’ ratings for the routes and includes perilous facts about them to highlight the dangers of driving.

The popularity of the map inspired the adventurous £200,000 mini break

The North Yungas road in Bolivia is widely considered to be the world’s most dangerous route and has even earned the nickname of ‘death road’.

The 40-mile stretch of single-track road meanders round cliffs and there are no barriers to protect drivers going in opposite directions from deadly drops.

Scotland's A726, otherwise known as the old A74 has a fear factor of four out of 10 n the map, which explains that the seven kilometre stretch of road is renowned for head-on collisions. Buyagift.com said that is a UK customer chose the route for their 2-day holiday, it would not cost £200,000

Each road is rated according to its ‘fear factor’ with the North Yungas scoring 10 out of 10, while Pakistan’s picturesque-sounding Fairy Meadows Road was rated the second scariest because of its ‘treacherous high altitude, unstable and narrow mountain roads.’

Factors such as altitude, safety precautions in place including barriers, local driving techniques, the condition of vehicles, road surfaces, annual road deaths per country and weather conditions were all taken into account when producing the map.

From cliff-top single track roads with deadly drops to highways rebound for their bandits, drivers could choose to take on the North Yungas road in Bolivia (pictured) which is widely considered to be the world's most dangerous route

If a driver chose the Trans Siberian Highway, pictured, they could potentially face the rain and uneven surfaces in a sports car - but the company offering the holiday warned that they would have to drive slowly and a vehicle with chunkier tyres would offer a more comfortable ride

The world’s longest road – the Pan-American Highway, which begins in Alaska and passes through countries in South America - is included on the map because of its high temperatures, landslides, impassable sections in wet weather and even livestock in the road.

But closer to home, Scotland’s A726, otherwise known as the old A74, has a fear factor of four out of 10.

The map explains that the seven kilometre stretch of road is renowned for head-on collisions and has racked up nearly 40 fatalities between 2000 and 2005.

A high proportion of the accidents involved pedestrians or cyclists, while one fifth saw vehicles leave the road, which is exceptionally twisty for a dual carriageway and is also busy.

Norway’s Trollstigen or ‘troll ladder’ comprises many hairpin bends and sheer drops which get particularly perilous in icy conditions, while Brazil’s Rodovia da Morte puts drivers at risk in a very different way.

The ‘highway of death’ is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and is poorly maintained, with gangs and bandits along its long stretch.

The map, which lists roads all over the world, was created to highlight the dangers of driving, as although road safety is improving, over 1.2million people are killed in road accidents each year and a further 20 to 50million are injured.
