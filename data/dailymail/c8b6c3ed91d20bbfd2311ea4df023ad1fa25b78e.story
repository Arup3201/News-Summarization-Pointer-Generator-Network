Ken Clarke told MPs the taxpayer-funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was now in 'serious financial difficulty'

Victims of violent street attacks left with a dislocated jaw or broken hand will be denied compensation under new cuts.

Burns victims with permanent scarring will also be refused payment as part of reforms announced yesterday by Justice Secretary Ken Clarke.

Payouts for minor injuries will be scrapped, while those for some more serious injuries will be sharply reduced to focus funding on ‘support services’ and the victims of the worst crimes, he said.

Around 15,000 a year will lose out  under the changes. Critics said it was wrong that ‘innocent victims of crime’ should suffer.

Mr Clarke told MPs the taxpayer-funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was now in ‘serious financial difficulty’ with a deficit of more than £250million.

The changes to the scheme will see an end to all payouts for ‘lower level’ injuries. Mr Clarke said they would affect those with ‘sprained ankles, broken toes or bruised ribs’.

Currently there are 25 compensation bands starting at £1,000 for minor sprains and fractures, or ‘temporary mental anxiety’. At the top end victims can receive up to £250,000 if they suffer paralysis and very serious brain damage requiring fulltime care.

Under the proposals, awards for the lowest five bands will be scrapped. Anyone with a minor head injury, such as concussion or headaches lasting up to four months, would be excluded, as would attack victims who have suffered a dislocated jaw or broken hand.

Burns victims who have suffered ‘minor disfigurement’ and would otherwise have been given £1,500 will also receive nothing.

More serious injuries, such as a broken foot, moderate burns or a fractured collar bone will see payouts cut.

A victim who suffered a broken jaw  which needed an operation and suffers ‘continuing significant disability’ would currently be entitled to £8,200, but this would fall  to £6,200.

Someone who suffered a fractured skull needing an operation would receive £6,600 now, but will see that cut to £4,600. Payouts for moderate facial disfigurement will be cut from £5,500 to £3,500.

The amount crime victims would receive for loss of earnings could also be capped at £12,600.

However higher level awards for victims of more serious crimes will be protected, Mr Clarke said, as will payments to the families of murder victims.

He told the House of Commons the scheme in its current form was ‘not sustainable’.‘Instead of compensation going to those with less grave injuries and those who have been breaking the law, it will be targeted where it counts – on the most serious injuries,’ he said.

‘The support services which many victims need as much as – or more than – compensation will be available when required, paid  for as far as possible by offenders, not  the taxpayer.

‘For families bereaved by homicide, and those affected by serious violent and sexual crimes, these reforms will move compensation on to a sustainable footing, and at the same time improve the quality and availability of practical support and advice.’

But Labour justice spokesman Sadiq  Khan said the plans appeared to be a ‘smokescreen, masking much wider and deeper cuts to compensation for those innocent victims  of crime.’

And Jean Taylor, from Families Fighting for Justice said: ‘If you have been attacked, no matter why you have been attacked you should be compensated in some way.

‘We knew there were going to be cuts  but these are quite serious injuries and victims should be helped. Ken Clarke should think again.’

Mr Clarke will also scrap compensation for anyone with a criminal record. Over the past decade around 20,000 criminals have been paid more than £75million, including a convicted rapist who was given £62,000 and a double killer handed more than £27,000.

Based on figures for the last two years, more than 17,000 claims totalling in excess of £25million for injuries including sprained ankles, broken toes and dislocated jaws would no longer qualify for compensation under the proposals.

A further 12,950 claims totalling £50million would be reduced.

Current £60 fines which are dished out to motorists caught driving, using their mobile phones and speeding, could rise to between £80 and £100

These would include payouts for brain injuries, such as minor brain damage, well-controlled epilepsy and permanent disabling dislocations and fractures, the Ministry of Justice consultation document said.

The victims’ surcharge – a levy on fines issued by the courts which funds support for victims of crime – currently raises about £10million each year. However, the Government also spends about £66million on these victim and witness support services.

In a separate move, victims could be given a greater say in the sentences handed down to offenders, with new rules for judges.

Current guidance means judges should take victims’ statements into account when passing sentence, but many victims do not realise this.

In future all victims will be encouraged to make statements expressing the impact a crime has had on them.
