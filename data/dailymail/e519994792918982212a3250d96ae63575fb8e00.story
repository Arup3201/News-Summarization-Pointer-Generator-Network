A family were shocked to find a perfect imprint of an owl on their window after the bird flew into it overnight.

Mother-of-two Lisa Loader, 41, feared for the owl's life when she discovered the beautiful impression.

But, after inspecting the area around the window, she was reassured that it had survived.

Ms Loader, of Bridport, Dorset, said: 'I was scared I would go outside to find an owl lying on the ground - it looked like it hit the window really hard.

'Luckily, when I went out to take a look, there was nothing there, so we're hoping it survived.'

Nik Shelton, who works for the RSPB, said the print was probably caused by the waterproofing residue found on owl feathers.

He said: 'Owls have a natural residue which occasionally leaves this kind of mark on windows.

'If there was no owl lying around outside it probably picked itself up and flew off - most likely a bit dazed.'

He added: 'We do get sent pictures like this from time to time, but rarely with such detail.

'Hanging tinsel might help prevent this sort of thing. If it happens a lot we recommend putting stickers of bird silhouettes on the window.'
