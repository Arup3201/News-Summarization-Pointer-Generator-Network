A farmer who found oil bubbling up onto his land is not about to reap a windfall from the shock discovery - because the crude comes not from an undiscovered deposit, but from a burst pipeline.

Steve Jensen owns the farm in North Dakota which last month became the site of the largest oil spill ever to take place on land in the U.S.

He now fears his land will not be fertile for years to come, and could claim thousands of dollars in compensation from the company whose pipeline runs beneath the farm near the remote town of Tioga.

Record: 20,000 barrels of crude oil have spilled from a pipeline running through North Dakota

Damage: The spill is set to make the farmland unusable for two or three years, according to Mr Jensen

Mr Jensen's discovery has been compared to The Beverly Hillbillies, the classic sitcom in which farmer Jed Clampett strikes it rich by finding oil on his land.

However, rather than profiting Mr Jensen is set to lose out, as he quickly realised that the crude oil he could see was in fact from a pipeline which runs from the Bakken rock formation to a nearby freight railway hub.

He found the oil on September 29 when he was harvesting wheat and saw black liquid standing six inches deep in his fields.

The oil came from a 'perfectly round, quarter-inch hole' producing 'about 100 pounds pressure', Mr Jensen told FoxNews.com.

It soon emerged that the pipe, owned by Tesoro Logistics, had spewed out a total of 20,600 barrels of oil, apparently the biggest spill on land in American history.

The spill covered an area of land the size of seven football fields, and produced enough oil to fill three Olympic-sized swimming pools.

Mr Jensen says it has ruined much of his land, affecting his livelihood for several years, and he will not be able to sell grain for human consumption if it has been grown within half a mile of the spill.

'I'm not going to be able to farm that land for a few years and there'll be compensation for sure,' he said. 'That is going to come later. We're looking at a two- to three-year cleanup.'

It took two weeks for state officials to tell the public about the spill, prompting environmentalists to speak out about alleged close links between the state and oil companies which are vital to its economy.

Compensation: Mr Jensen says the company responsible for the spill should make up for his losses

'As long as we let oil companies keep us locked into these forms of extreme fossil fuels, we'll continue to see spills like these,' Greenpeace's Phil Radford told FoxNews.com.

Mr Jensen said that the amount of oil released into the soil would be 'pretty detrimental to any living organism that's in the ground'.

The pipeline has been shut down by Tesoro while the oil is cleaned from the surrounding area, with the spill expected to cost the firm nearly $2million.

However, experts this week questioned the company's estimate of how much oil leaked from the pipelines, saying it was 'at best a guess'.

An engineer who helped measure the amount of oil spilt in the Gulf by the broken BP well Deepwater Horizon said that the estimate by Tesoro did not appear to be backed up by any scientific studies.
