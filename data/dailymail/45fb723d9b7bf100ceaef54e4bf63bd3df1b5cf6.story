With a private jet and helicopter at their beck and call and al fresco dining at 3,500 metres (11,500 feet), it was the kind of weekend even Prince Harry is likely never to forget.

Further details of the royal’s controversial - and, clearly, very lavish - ski holiday to Kazakhstan emerged yesterday and are unlikely to sit comfortably with human rights campaigners who have already condemned the trip.

Friends of the fourth in line to throne have openly boasted about their four-day jaunt, even posting pictures from inside their plane on social media.

Polar explorer Inge Solheim, who organised the weekend, shared an image of his pretty wife, Anna, toasting the experience from the comfort of her leather-lined seat on Instagram he bragged: ‘Anna looks very happy for the “upgrade” from Ryanair this weekend : - ) #adventure #backtoreality’.

His wife replied: ‘Best weekend ever : - )’ and Tweeted from the flight: ‘Amaaazing weekend. Feeling blessed.’

Another member of the party posted a picture of an opulent private mountain-side lunch, with furs thrown over their chairs and woven rugs placed on the grass.

Amnesty International has accused the Queen’s grandson of exercising poor judgement by holidaying in a country with such an appalling human rights record.

The country’s despotic president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been accused of torturing and killing political opponents, stifling press freedom and profiteering from his country’s vast reserves of oil and gas.

Kensington Palace have refused to comment on the prince’s ‘private’ trip or discuss who bankrolled it, although sources close to the prince insist he was merely ‘tagging along’ after being invited by friends.

However the Mail understands that it was paid for by Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen, who has made millions from luxury developments in the country.

It is understood that Mr Oymen, who lives in Monaco but has homes in several countries, sent his private plane to London to collect Harry, 29, his girlfriend of two years, Cressida Bonas, as well as Norwegian-born Mr Solheim and his wife.

His long-term partner, Czech model Tereza Maxova, later published a picture taken during the weekend of a lavish picnic with the caption: ‘Shashlik [a type of Russian kebab] at 3,500m.’

Mr Oymen, 40, is the son of a senior Turkish politician and co-founder of commercial real estate developers Capital Partners.

He and his business partner, Serzhan Zhumashoc, who himself has close links with the controversial Kazakh ruler, President Nazarbayev, own the ski resort of Shymbulak where Harry stayed.

In a recent interview he boasted how he wished to turn the once down-at-heel Soviet downhill ski training centre into the ‘Courcheval of Kazakhstan’.

Sources close to the prince flatly deny any links between Harry and Mr Oymen and say he had never met him before the trip and has no plans to meet him again, despite his lavish hospitality.

But having the Queen’s grandson grace the developer’s fledging ski resort with his presence will clearly do little harm to its public image.

Mr Oymen was also behind the building of Kazakhstan’s first luxury goods mall and hotel development which opened last year in a blaze of publicity.

The property mogul flew out supermodel Eva Herzigova for the champagne-laced occasion which brought firms including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Armani to the oil-rich Kazakhstani elite.

Calls to his office in Almaty were not being answered yesterday.

The man behind the holiday is respected 41-year-old adventurer Inge Solheim, who recently led Prince Harry on a charity trek to the South Pole for the Walking With The Wounded charity, which supports injured service personnel.

The prince’s team included several seriously injured servicemen and women and a documentary on the team’s remarkable achievement recently aired on ITV.

His glamorous wife, Anna, who works as a luxury brand social media manager, posted a series of pictures taken during their weekend on the internet. All are on freely accessible sites.

One showed the royal party boarding the Government-owned helicopter that chauffeured them to and from the slopes each day saying:

‘First attempt at #helli-skiing. Eek! 4100 meters up. #altitudesickness.’

Prince Harry was attacked by human rights campaigners for taking a private jet to enjoy a weekend's skiing in Kazakhstan

She also shared a video she had shot from inside the former Soviet military helicopter showing her husband and what appears to be Prince Harry skiing toward her, with the words: ‘Waiting in the #chopper for hubbie to appear over the horizon #heliski’.

As recently as Sunday there was another ‘selfie’ showing her tucking into some delicacies picked up during the trip. The caption read: ‘eating #caviar from #kazakhstan with salmon & cream cheese #2spoiltgirls’.

Mr Solheim’s spokesman did not return calls yesterday.

Another photograph from the weekend, which emerged yesterday, shows Harry and his girlfriend accompanied by one of the prince’s most trusted personal protection officers.

The same officer was pictured with him in a Jacuzzi on the prince’s notorious holiday to Las Vegas where he was photographed playing a game of naked billiards in a hotel suite.

Local reports say the couple were met at their private jet by the ski resort manager, and stayed in a ‘cosy cottage’ close to the main slope.

The couple also enjoyed hiking and glacier climbing and on their last day flew to the Dmitiev Glacier for a spot of heli-skiing.
