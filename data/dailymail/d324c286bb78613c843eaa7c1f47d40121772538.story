Speaker John Bercow wants to increase the commercial potential of the House of Commons

John Bercow is planning a worldwide search for a £200,000- a-year Commons chief executive to  help to drive forward his controversial plans to commercialise the  Palace of Westminster.

The Speaker is looking to break with centuries of history by appointing an entrepreneurial figure ‘in the mould of businesswoman Karren Brady or Sir Richard Branson’, with a shortlist of candidates drawn up after an extensive search.

But Mr Bercow’s critics claim the plan is part of the Speaker’s desire to create his own West Wing-style powerbase in Parliament.

The move follows last week’s announcement that Clerk of the House, Sir Robert Rogers – the most senior Parliamentary official – is retiring after just two-and-a-half years in the post.

Sir Robert, who has worked in  Parliament for more than 42 years, had a tense relationship with Mr Bercow, marked by disagreements over the Speaker’s plans to increase Parliament’s income and bring more ‘outsiders’ into management.

With the crumbling Commons  facing a repair bill estimated at more than £1 billion, Mr Bercow believes that more money needs to be found from commercial  ventures, such as hiring out the facilities to film companies – so  Sir Robert’s replacement should have a dazzling business CV.

The Clerk of the House has traditionally been a constitutional  expert promoted from within the ranks of Commons officials. The Clerk’s job, which comes with a  £196,000-a-year salary, is currently split into two roles, doubling as both the chief constitutional adviser to the Speaker and the effective chief executive of the Commons.

Under the new plan, the constitutional duties will be largely taken over by other officials.

Public advertisements for the  position will be placed throughout  the Commonwealth.

Sir Robert Rogers, Clerk of the House wanted to maintain the the traditions associated with the building

Sir Robert, 64, is highly respected  for the way he has managed to juggle Mr Bercow’s desire to modernise Parliament with the need to preserve Westminster’s traditions.

He received a rare round of applause from MPs after his  retirement letter was read out  by Mr Bercow.

It read: ‘Whatever the vicissitudes of parliamentary life and whatever brickbats may be thrown at it, I can truly say that the House now is a more effective scrutineer of the executive and more topical, relevant and independent-minded than I  have ever known it.’

But relations between him and  Mr Bercow had become increasingly strained as the Speaker  explored ways to boost Parliament’s revenues, described by critics as the ‘Disneyfication of the Commons’.

A source said: ‘There was a running tension between Robert and Bercow over the extent to which outsiders should be brought in to run the place.

‘It was not so much the principle  – Robert is a good deal more open-minded than his predecessors and knows the Commons needs to be modernised – as the bombastic  and temperamental manner of  Bercow’s demands. It was all about creating his own fiefdom, a sort of White House West Wing.

‘He has made clear that the new boss has to be more of a Brady or a Branson than an Erskine May.’Labour MP Barry Sheerman said last night: ‘This doesn’t surprise me at all. The House of Commons Commission [its governing body] has completely lost the plot.

‘Opening up to every Tom, Dick and Harry does not work. It is a security risk and prevents us from serving our constituents in the efficient way they deserve.’

A spokesman for the Speaker said: ‘The search has begun to recruit  a new Clerk, which will include candidates drawn from abroad.

‘The successful candidate will need to combine business experience with constitutional expertise.’
