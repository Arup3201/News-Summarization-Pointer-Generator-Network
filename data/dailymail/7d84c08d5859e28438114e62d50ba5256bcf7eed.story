A multimillionaire football chairman at the centre of a racism storm has admitted calling Chinese people 'chingalings' in a bizzare new interview while trying to defend his actions.

Dave Whelan, chairman of Wigan Athletic, is already under fire over remarks he made in another interview where he reportedly said that at some point every Englishman had called a 'Chinaman a chink'.

The 78-year-old is also alleged to have added that 'Jewish people chase money more than everybody else.'

Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan, who is facing a fresh racism storm after he admitted calling Chinese people 'chingalings' 

In an attempt to draw a line under under the allegations of racism, Mr Whelan gave an interview in the Jewish Telegraph, where he apologised profusely for his remarks and said he had nothing but respect for Jewish people.

He also talked about the high regard in which he held Jewish people and mentioned how 'two Jewish boys' had shown him the ropes in market trading at the end of his playing career.

However, when asked by the newspaper whether he himself had ever used the term 'chink' when referring to Chinese people, he replied: 'When I was growing up we used to call the Chinese 'chingalings'.

'We weren't being disrespected (sic). We used to say, "we're going to eat in chingalings".

'The Chinese weren't offended by that. That was the name everyone in Wigan called it (the first Chinese cafe in Wigan).'

It is now understood that the Football Association is looking into Mr Whelan's remarks and is deciding whether to take action.

But his latest comments prompted criticism from the Chinese community who say the term 'chink' and 'chingaling' are highly offensive.

Mr Whelan had previously come under fire for remarks he made in another newspaper interview while defending the appointment of Wigan's new manager Malky Mackay, who is also facing an FA investigation into alleged racist and homophobic text messages 

Michael Wilkes, a spokesman for the British Chinese Project told the Guardian: 'For many in the Chinese community these words hold deep emotional resonance, as they are often used in conjunction with racial violence, harassment and hate crimes.

'Therefore, to say that "there is nothing wrong" with using such terms or that Chinese people 'aren't offended' by their use, demonstrates a dangerous level of ignorance.

'We have noticed that Mr Whelan has truly gone out of his way to apologise to the Jewish community, it is a shame that the same level of apology hasn't been extended to the Chinese community.'

The former owner of JJB Sports, who is thought to be worth around £200million, has already been asked to respond to an FA misconduct charge over his original comments as he was trying to defend the appointment of Malky Mackay as the club's new manager.

Mr Whelan, who is thought to be worth around £200million is the founder of the JJB Sports chain and bought his hometown club in February 1995

Mr Mackay is also the subject of an FA investigation into allegedly racist and homophobic text messages sent during his time at Cardiff City. Both he and Mr Whelan deny being racist.

Cardiff owner Vincent Tan, who sacked Mackay last December, branded Mr Whelan a 'racist' following his appointment of Mackay and subsequent controversial remarks.

Mr Whelan has said he would resign if the FA 'even suggest I'm guilty' of making racist remarks.

Shortly afterwards, two of the team’s sponsors ended their arrangement with the club, with kitchen appliances firm Premier Range describing its position as ‘untenable’.

But a spokesman for Mr Whelan later said: ‘The quotes were taken out of context and twisted.’

The former Blackburn and Crewe Alexandra player bought his hometown club in February 1995, overseeing an incredible rise from Division Three to win last year's FA Cup.

Wigan currently sit 23rd in the Championship standings and have yet to win since their new manager's appointment.
