Janet Pearson, 57, is accused of planting the wire which tripped up her neighbour Kari Anderson causing her to fall down two flights of stairs

A feud between two women at an exclusive flats complex ended up in court after one of them allegedly laid a tripwire outside her neighbour’s door.

Kari Anderson was sent hurtling down two flights of stairs after tripping over as she walked out of her apartment, a court heard yesterday.

The 53-year-old – who suffered injuries to her face, wrist, neck and back – was left lying in a heap and weeping with pain at the bottom of the stairs.

A court heard the tripwire had been purposefully placed outside her flat door by Janet Pearson, 57.

When Miss Anderson came out in the dark, she failed to spot it.

She said: ‘I was carrying a bin bag in one hand and an overnight bag in the other. I felt something sharp on my shin and that was the last thing I remember.’ 

She said she ended up ‘lying at the bottom [of the stairs], crying’ after her wrist was bent backwards in the fall. 

‘I still remember the pain. I could taste blood. It was on my face and in my hair. As I walked back up the stairs, I used my phone to see what had caused me to fall.

‘I shined the light at the top of the stairs and then I saw the wire. Her door was closed on the wire to keep it in place.’

Yesterday Pearson denied assault and causing actual bodily harm when she appeared at Preston Crown Court. 

The jury heard the pair had been neighbours for many years in the exclusive seafront apartments of the genteel Lancashire town of Lytham.

Homes on their street regularly sell for as much as £1.5million.

There had been minor disagreements between the pair over the years but trouble flared when Pearson moved a homeless man in with her.

Miss Anderson claims he would drink heavily and stand in the hallway outside her flat smoking cigarettes, which he then stubbed out in her plant pots.

Injured: Neighbour Kari Anderson, 53

The mother of one, who has lived in the £400,000 penthouse suite with her son for 15 years, said: ‘I came home in the middle of the night and he was standing there in her dressing gown smoking a cigarette.

‘He thought it was funny to throw his cigarette butts into my flower pots so I asked him to stop. He shouted abuse at me and was very offensive so, when I told my son, he went round and told him not to do it again.’

The pair also fell out over a storage cupboard in the hall between the two flats which, Miss Anderson claimed, her neighbour was using.

She said: ‘I asked her if she could take her things out of my cupboard in the hallway and she didn’t. It’s my store cupboard and I paid a lot of money to have it installed.’

The court heard the ‘tripwire’ incident happened on January 21 when Miss Anderson stepped out of her apartment. But Pearson claimed she actually stumbled over a set of Christmas fairy lights.

Robert Brown, a retired judge who lives in the block, said he was aware of a lighting problem in the common hallway.

He added: ‘Miss Pearson had rigged up a little lighting system of her own. It consisted of fairylights in a cluster, which she had hung on the wall just outside her door, that was fed by a plug which she had put in to her own socket just inside the door to her apartment.’ 

The trial continues.
