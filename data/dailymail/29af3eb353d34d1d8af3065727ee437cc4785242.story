A 16-year-old boy accidentally ran over and killed his two-year-old niece after he moved a car to clean the yard for her birthday party.

Luis Martinez, who did not have a driver's license, was moving the SUV so he could sweep grass cuttings from the drive, when little Amaris ran behind the car in Apopka, Florida.

The two-year-old had run out unseen from the side of the house, and was crushed by the back tire on the left hand side of the car.

'Anybody, where there is a child 
involved, it tears at your heart. Whether you know 
them, or you don’t know them. It’s just a tragedy and this family with 
never be the same,' Corporal Kristen Neutzling, from Florida Highway 
Patrol, told 13news.

The family had been tidying up the yard on Wednesday afternoon, in readiness for a birthday party they were due to hold for Amaris at the weekend.

Because the accident happened on private property it is unlikely Luis will be charged with a criminal act, but police are still investigating.

'He was just backing [the car] up as he had mowed the grass and then he was blowing the grass of the driveway,' Corporal Neutzling said.

'She ran out the side of the house as he was backing up and had got behind the vehicle.'

Amaris was taken to hospital where she died from her injuries.

Neighbor Richard Shoemaker told Click Orlando he saw the girl's father collapse as police told him about the accident.

'I saw the police put their arms around him and console him, and I saw him basically just go to his knees in the street crying,' he said.

He added that he had been concerned about a child being knocked down in the neighborhood, because so many did not pay attention to cars as they rode their bikes around.

Police have interviewed Luis about the collision.

'Honestly, I don’t know how it could have been prevented in this situation other than just checking and double checking,' Corporal Neutzling said.
