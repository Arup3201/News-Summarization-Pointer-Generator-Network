Julie Bentley, the chief executive of Girl Guiding UK, says the organisation is seen as 'middle class' and wants to attract young people from diverse backgrounds

Girl Guiding needs to get rid of its ‘middle-class’ reputation and show people that it is ‘cool’, according to its new chief executive.

Julie Bentley said she wants to shed the image that Girl Guides is for people of a certain class, and is working hard to show young people ‘what it is really like’.

But at the same time she promised not to ‘throw the baby out with the bath water’ and to keep the organisation’s traditional activities, from making chocolate to building a campfire.

Miss Bentley said ‘I would have probably had the perception that Girl Guides was for middle-class girls when I was growing up, seeing as I am very working class and I was never a Brownie or a Guide.

‘However, the units do reﬂect the places they are in - in terms of social class, diversity and ethnicity.’

The head of Girl Guiding UK added the organisation has an image problem that she was intent on improving. ‘I haven’t made Guides cool. I’ve just shown everyone how cool it is’, she told the Daily Telegraph.

'But there is a real schism between what the organisation is and what people think.

‘I am working hard to shine a light on Girl Guiding UK so people can see what it’s really like — and that it is for everyone.’

Girl Guides is working with charities and youth workers to engage more girls in deprived communities and establish units in places where they have never previously existed.

Currently, there are 546,406 members and supporters ranging from girls aged five to the senior section, who can be up to 26.

She added: 'The number of new girls joining Girl Guides has been growing over the last eight years.

'However, we already have waiting lists of girls in many areas and if we are to serve more young women, we need more volunteers, from a variety of backgrounds to lead a programme in their local community.'

Miss Bentley one described Girl Guiding as the 'ultimate feminist organisation' as it teaches girls confidence and valuable life skills.

'There is still a glass building and we have to teach them how to break it,' she said.
