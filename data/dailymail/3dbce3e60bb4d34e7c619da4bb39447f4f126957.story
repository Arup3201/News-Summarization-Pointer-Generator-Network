Had he known he was heading for 'Blow Me Down' park, perhaps Jonathan Trappe would have taken a different route with his helium balloon.

But his fate was in the winds, quite literally, and after just 12 hours since launch and experiencing problems, he decided to cut his losses and crash on land, rather than risk further problems across the Atlantic.

Dropping at a rate of knots over mountains and forest, he had no idea he was heading straight for Newfoundland's ironically named reserve, 'Blow Me Down Provincial Park'.

Shattered dreams: Jonathan Trappe's lifelong dream to cross the Atlantic under a canopy of helium balloons ended in disaster in a forest in Newfoundland, Canada

It wasn't until he was rescued the next that he realised where he had landed, and couldn't resist a photo with the fatefully named park

He eventually landed after a scary 
descent, five miles south of the park, but when he realised how close he
had come, he couldn't resist a photo with the signpost.

Mr Trappe says his attempt to cross the Atlantic using helium was doomed due to 'technical problems'.

The 39-year-old pulled off a risky dusk landing in thick fog then spent the night in a bog in the Canadian wilderness.

However, his trip set a new world record for the longest flight of its kind using he world's largest assembly of cluster balloons.

Incredible footage shot with a Go Pro camera shows Mr Trappe coming down fast through the trees as he prepares to land.

The explorer frantically shears away balloons with a knife to bring him down to earth.

Promising: Things seemed to get off to a good start when he launched Sept 12 from Maine, USA, to begin his 2,500 mile journey across the ocean

But it all ended in disaster, when after just 12 hours flying, and having travelled 350 miles, hie started to experience problems with his balloons

In interview for the first time since his dangerous crash landing, Mr Trappe explained how he had to judge whether to lose ballast or cut balloons as he tried to navigate a safe landing at 50mph over a forest and past a mountain, without being sure of the coastline

The only communication he had with those following his crossing, was to let them know he'd landed safely and would spend the night in his 'boat'. He didn't know where he had landed

He said: 'Before I could land I first 
had to clear over a mountain - there is no way to land any aircraft on 
this mountain - a helicopter, an aeroplane, or a balloon.

'I was coming in at 50mph and I couldn't 
tell where the coast was, where the water stops or where the land 
started. I could only see the mountain.

'It was a very sharp sequence of venting and ballasting that got me down through the trees and onto the ground.'

Speaking exclusively to Barcroft Media, Jonathan also revealed cutting loose the hundreds of colourful helium balloons that had kept him afloat was one of the hardest moments.

He said: 'It was heartbreaking letting the balloons go - they were like my babies.

Video footage of Jonathan Trappe showed how he lurched form releasing ballast and cutting balloons as he tried to dodge the trees and mountains

The view from inside the craft as it crashed through the forest canopy shows just how dangerous a landing Mr Trappe lived through

The explorer spent the night in the forest, with nothing but the swamp mosquitoes to accompany him

'But it was either come down on land or come down in the middle of the Atlantic.'

And rather than calling for help, the 
IT consultant from Raleigh, North Carolina, US, made camp in his gondola
among hundreds of mosquitos.

He said: 'I had no idea where I was and it was too dark to venture out.

'I had three bottles of mosquito repellent which I left for the people who helped me inflate.

'I would have given $100 for one that night.

The next morning, he assessed the situation and began to prepare the equipment to be rescued

Help arrived: Mr Trappe prepared to airlift his craft out from the Canadian wilderness after he crashed at 50mph ending his Atlantic crossing attempt using helium balloons

During the rescue attempt, the yellow craft became entangled in the trees

Jonathan chartered a helicopter to winch the yellow gondola out of the Canadian wilderness in preparation for his return to the US

'But
I didn't want anyone to risk their safety coming out to look for me. I 
radioed my control center and told them not to put out a call.

'The next day I found out I had landed in a bog. There was hundreds of mosquitoes everywhere.

'The area that I landed in was completely impassible.'

His
dramatic journey also saw him almost freeze directly after take off 
when condensation from the ground began to freeze as he gained altitude.

He said: 'As I climbed higher my hair froze into spikes.

The intrepid adventurer was forced to cut short his incredible quest after just 12 hours due to technical problems and his craft was eventually retrieved from the Canadian wilderness by a helicopter

Deflated: Mr Trappe, who has crossed the Alps floating beneath a cluster of helium balloons, said he feels deflated by his latest attempt to cross the Atlantic

Rescued: Mr Trappe said during his night in the forest, he would have paid $100 for some mosquito repellant

Sad ending: He was lucky to escape unscathed from his perilous landing, but the adventurer says he was devastated to have to cut loose hi s balloons, realising his Atlantic crossing attempt was over

'The water droplet on the balloons froze and started falling on me like snow.

'I had to strip off all my clothes and change into new ones because they were frozen."

However, for most of the journey Jonathan enjoyed perfect weather reached heights of up to 23,000ft in clear blue skies.

On Sunday Jonathan chartered a private helicopter and winched his yellow gondola out of the bog in preparation for his trip back to the US.

Although turbulent Atlantic weather was the main threat to the record attempt, a technical problem with ballast caused the attempt to be aborted.

The doomed crossing all began on September 12 in Maine, after hundreds of supporters helped prepare the journey by filling hundreds of giant helium balloons

Despite fears Atlantic weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to achieving his dream crossing, the landing was blamed on a technical problem relating to the balloons

In spite of his failed Atlantic crossing attempt, Mr Trappe still managed to break the world record for furthest distance flown in a cluster balloon

The explorer revealed that ballast consumption during the initial part of his flight would not have allowed for the full crossing.

"There was no way I was going to make it across and it was better to go down on land than in the middle of nowhere,' he added.

'I was going through my ballast too fast - I either had to land here or in the middle of the ocean.'

The cluster balloonist was attempting to cross the Atlantic using giant balloons filled with helium. However, he still managed to break the world record for furthest distance flown in a cluster balloon.

There were commiserations around the world - including a message from Virgin boss and fellow balloonist, Richard Branson.

Lift off: The balloon launched at 6.30am but it only travelled for 12 hours before Mr Trappe made the decision to abort the record-breaking attempt

His planned route would have seen him hitch a ride on winds propelling him towards Europe - potentially landing anywhere between Iceland and Morocco

He became the only person to have crossed the English Channel by cluster balloon in May 2010, and the Alps in September 2011

He tweeted: 'Commiserations to Jonathan Trappe, who has abandoned his UP-style cluster balloon crossing. I know how you must feel!'

Trappe messaged his followers on Facebook saying he had landed at an 'alternate location' and was safe and well.

The IT consultant from Raleigh, North Carolina, US, took off on Thursday September 12 at 6.30am EST attempting to be the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean via cluster balloon.

Following the crash landing, Kevin Knapp, based at the command centre, said: 'I can confirm that Jonathan was forced to abandon the planned flight at around 18.30 EST.

The incredible helium balloon project sounds like the stuff of fantasy adventures, like the Pixar film UP

'Thankfully he is safe and well and currently making preparations to get home.

'While disappointing that he had to cut his quest across the Atlantic short, I know Jonathan thanks everyone for their support and encouragement.'

Despite fears Atlantic weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to achieving his dream crossing, the landing was blamed on a technical problem relating to the balloons.

Fans of the adventurer who were following his movements via a satellite tracker were first alerted to his plight at around 7.30pm EST.
