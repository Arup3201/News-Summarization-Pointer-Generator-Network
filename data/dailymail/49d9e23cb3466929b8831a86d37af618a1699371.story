Sir Ben Ainslie won gold at the London Olympics but his new business proposal isn't quite so popular

Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie has sailed into stormy waters with his plans to build a futuristic sailing headquarters.

The development would include offices, meeting rooms, training and medical facilities and a car park.

As well as his Olympic heroics, Ainslie helped the United States win
 the America's Cup last year.

He has submitted proposals for a high tower, 
which would loom over neighbouring buildings at the Solent in Old Portsmouth, Hants.

But the proposal has upset 
residents of an upmarket waterfront area, with more than 200 attending a recent public meeting to discuss the proposal.

And residents have banded together to fight the 25-metre high tower at the Camber dock.

Malcolm Hill, chairman of a committee of opponents, said more than 200 people attended the public meeting at the Royal Naval Club with many speaking out about the plans.

Mr Hill, who criticised Portsmouth City Council for rushing the planning permission process, said: 'I donâ€™t like the way this has been railroaded through and taken as a fait accompli.

'The public seem to have been kept out of it.

'From the number of people at the meeting this clearly is a sensitive issue.'

Another objector, Simon Martin, wrote:
 'My principal objection is to the height of the building which will be 
28 Metres in contravention to the Tall Building Policy.

'It is a monstrous carbuncle that needs drastic redesign to fit in with [planning] policies.'

Portsmouth is home to the far higher Spinnaker tower, standing at a colossal 170 metres and one of the tallest buildings in Britain outside the capital.

But resident Chris Ormes wrote: 'I remember when the Spinnaker was first suggested there was a choice of design. Where is the choice here!'

He added: 'Like a lot of people I want what's best for the area that I have chosen to live in, and bringing work to the area is a good thing.

Residents fear that if the building goes ahead it will tower over parts of old Portsmouth

Looming: Portsmouth also has the 170m Spinnaker tower (left), but an objector said that was better-planned

'However, building a huge structure that will dwarf everything around it is not the answer.

'The
 planners must remember that first and formost, this is in a 
conservation area, and that brings many rules and regulations that we 
all have to abide by.'

Some, however, supported the plans. Resident Steve Harding said: 'As a Spice Island resident I fully support the proposed development.

'The contemporary building design will create an iconic statement and be a huge improvement over the unattractive industrial units and parking area.

'The development will be a great benefit to the Camber and a coup for the city of Portsmouth.'

A Ben Ainslie spokesman said: 'We 
understand everyone will have differing views on the design of the 
building, some people are very positive with the modern design.

'Within Portsmouth there is a great mix 
of old and new architecture that sits together well and this is a 
further example of the same.'

Detailed: The plans have been lodged with Portsmouth City Council and will be decided in August

Ainslie, pictured in 2011, went on to become the most successful sailor in Olympic history

Ainslie won a silver medal on 
his Olympic debut as a 19-year-old at Atlanta in 1996 and went on to win
 medals at the following four games.

He is the most successful Olympic sailor in history.

The plans are due to be decided by Portsmouth City Council in August.
