Queen Letizia and her husband Felipe got in touch with their artistic sides at the inauguration of the First Picasso exhibition in Spain today.

In fact, the Spanish royal, 42, seemed to be channelling the artist's own style by wearing a  black and white striped  top that echoed Malaga-born Picasso's favourite Breton striped T-shirts.

While King Felipe's only concession to the arts was a patterned blue and white tie with his crisp blue suit, during the visit to the Museo de Belas Artes in A Coruna in the north west coastal region of Galicia.

It's safe to say that Queen Letizia has become a bona fide style icon. With her inherently chic fashion sense and her savvy shopping choices, it's not hard to see why.

Not only does she champion high fashion Spanish labels like Felipe Varela, but she also gets behind her home country's high-street brands by regularly rocking pieces from the likes of Zara and its sister brand Uterque.

This fab floral clutch is from the latter and Letizia must be quite a fan, as she also has it in black! In this case, she's used the red version to expertly add a pop of color to a classic ensemble of a midi skirt, a breton stripe top and burgundy stilettos.

The good news? This outfit is easily replicated. Dig out your trusty old bretons and simply team them with a black midi (a savvy, figure-flattering buy) and finish it all off with a blooming piece of arm candy.

She seemed to be paying tribute to Picasso's signature Breton striped T-shirts with a striped top of her own; she wore her hair in a loosely plaited up-do, gathered at the nape of her neck (right)

Former journalist Letizia teamed her top with a high-waisted full black skirt, patent plum court shoes and a  plum clutch with leather flower decoration from Uterque.

The shade is one of Letizia's favourites and today she picked her glossy plum lipstick to complete the look - along with a loose plaited up-do.

And it's not the first time the royal pair have showed their interest in one of Spain's most famous artists.

In September, they left daughters Leonor and Sofia at home to visit the Picasso Museum in Malaga, which celebrates the work of the famous spaniard, before attending a formal dinner. 

Meanwhile, the low-key royal proved that the Duchess of Cambridge isn't the only queen of thrift, with a penchant for recycling her outfits when she wore a black and white checked top this week, which she'd worn three times in the last four months.

She wore the windowpane check top by Danish label Designers Remix for the third time earlier this week  as she attended the Fundeu 10th Anniversary at BBVA Foundation in Madrid.

The glamorous mother-of-two paired the top with black trousers and high heels and added a pop of colour to her ensemble with red lipstick and a red clutch.

The Spanish royal was last seen in the Designers Remix top in November when she welcomed charity campaigners to the Zarzuela Palace on the outskirts of Madrid.

On that occasion she teamed it with red heels and more subtle make-up.

She also wore the garment in October as she spent the day manning a Red Cross stall in Madrid, again wearing it with red heels.

Today the queen received a warm welcome when she arrived at the anniversary event without husband King Felipe, 47. 

She wore a long, black coat on her arrival which she took off before she went on stage to make a speech.

It's been a busy week for Letizia, a former journalist, as on Sunday she and the king attended a Spanish cultural awards ceremony.

For that occasion, she looked stylish in a navy, cream and black £1,753 illusion dress designed by Carolina Herrera.

Thanks to her choice of flattering dresses, smart suits and designer garments, the queen is gaining a reputation as one of the world's most stylish women.

Harper's Bazaar magazine recently observed that: 'Since her marriage to Prince Felipe of Spain in 2004, Queen Letizia has cemented her status as a royal style icon. 

'With an air of casual elegance, the former journalist infuses her professional wardrobe with chic statement pieces and a hint of sultry appeal.'
