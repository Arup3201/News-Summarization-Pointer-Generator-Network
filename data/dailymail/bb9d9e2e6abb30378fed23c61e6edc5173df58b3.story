A mother has taken a photo of her daughter every day for a year to document her baby girl growing up.

Starting when her daughter was just four months old, Mary Potsig, 43, has now taken a picture of baby Arwen for 365 consecutive days.

The mother-of-three from Allendale, Northumberland, did not want her youngest daughter to be neglected when it came to the family album so started the project to document her early life.

Arwen, Mary's third child, sleeping just after birth swaddled in a white blanket.

Before long she found herself taking a picture a day of Arwen and uploading them to a photo-sharing site.

Mary, an advisory teacher for children with autism, said: 'When you have a third child, recording their milestones can sometimes be forgotten about, and I realised I wasn’t taking as many pictures of Arwen as I had been with Grace, six, and Ophelia, four.

'It was quite difficult to keep up with the pictures. Some days I had to just grab a picture when I saw her, and some days it was just a screen grab off my phone.

Wednesday 7 August 2013: Mary snaps a selfie with Arwen, who is clearly fascinated by the process

'It’s proved a really nice way to document some of her ‘firsts’ - her first steps are in there and her first time in a swimming pool.

'Life gets busy and just stopping to take a picture you capture things you would normally miss. Children grow up so quickly and it’s great to have a record of that.'

Mary uploaded the pictures to the photo journal site Blipfoto.com.

It is the second journal she has created on the site with the encouragement of her husband Colin, a professional photographer.

She said: 'My first project I took a picture a day for 500 days.

'I’m an amateur photographer so most of the photos are taken on my phone, but it doesn’t stop me.

'Taking a photo a day is more of a challenge than people realise, but I didn’t intend for my project with Arwen to be a daily thing - I thought it would just be a nice record of her growing up.

'It’s been a great thing to do and it’s lovely looking back on it.'

Arwen has become so used to having her picture taken she has even started taking them herself.

Mary said: 'If I leave Arwen with the iPad then she can open the app and take a picture of herself.

'Her selfies aren’t great - mainly of the tops of her head or her tummy but she’s getting there.

'Maybe one day she’ll grow up to be a photographer like her dad.'
