Forget NekNominate - now there's an online parody of the deadly drinking craze where women - and even men - flash their bras.

Dubbed NipNominate, the new viral hit sees people posting images of their cleavage instead of downing drinks.

It
 was started by Michelle Kent, 35, who was so disgusted with the binge drinking game that she launched the slogan 'Bangers to Cancer' - and NipNominate was born.

An online parody of the drinking game NekNominate - where women flash their bras - has gone viral

Dubbed NipNominate, the new viral hit sees people posting images of their cleavage instead of downing drinks. They then donate to the Bangers to Cancer charity campaign

Model Brandy Brewer from Cornwall has also joined the campaign

Less than 24 hours in, NipNominate has already raised nearly £4,000 for charity

Rather than 
downing dangerous cocktails of alcohol, she whipped off her top and 
posted a photo of her exposed underwear on Facebook, urging others to do
 the same.

Her snap soon went viral, with hundreds of users posting shots of their own 
their cleavage before nominating someone else to do the same.

The Facebook is linked to a JustGiving page where so far more than £3,700 has been donated to Breast Cancer Care in 24 hours. The target is £50,000

Michelle,
 a nursing student from Redruth, Cornwall, has seen her idea grow and 
attact hundreds of NipNominators across the world, including model 
Brandy Amy Brewer.

Ms Kent said: 'It is a wonderful charity and we seem to be getting support from 
as far as New Zealand, the states and South Africa.

'It
 is not only women getting involved, but some men have taken up the 
challenge too.

It was started by Michelle Kent, 35, who was so

Ms Kent said of her initiative: 'It's a way to raise cash and stop this NeckNominate game'

Ms Kent's snap soon went viral, with hundreds of users -both male and female - posting shots of their own their 'cleavage' before nominating someone else to do the same

Even pets aren't exempt from NipNominate, as this picture shows

Some of the girls involved had been very shy, but have 
come on board and done it anyway.

'It's a way to raise cash and stop this NeckNominate game.'

The idea is to take a picture of your cleavage (or a bra over a T-shirt), post it on Facebook and nominate three others or more and then donate.

Earlier this week, the former professional rugby player said to have started the deadly NekNominate craze which has claimed three lives in Britain said 'it has gone too far'.

Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game where players film themselves downing drinks and posting the videos online, daring others to outdo them.

The sportsman uploaded footage of himself 'necking' beer to Facebook and told his friends to do the same.

He posted: 'I nominate all of you whose birthday it's not. Merry Christmas'.

Within days of the post by the former London Irish and Barbarians player, the game was being regularly mentioned on Facebook and Twitter.

Others have said it is simply coincidence that Mr Samson posted a drinking video as the game suddenly took off.

He did not mention 'NekNominate' in his post - and other people around the world claim they were playing it throughout last year.

The game was first mentioned on Twitter in 2011 and there were 198 mentions of it throughout 2013.
