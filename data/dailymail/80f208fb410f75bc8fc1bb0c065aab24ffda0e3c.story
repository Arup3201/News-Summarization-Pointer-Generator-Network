1 RAHEEM DREAM

Naturally Kane-mania has kicked in, but the trio of players who started in forward positions for England are creating a bit of a stir.

‘Europe will fear us now,’ declared Wayne Rooney and although it was a little optimistic, the front three are moving in the right direction.

Roy Hodgson calls Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck his ‘five yard furies’, two players capable of causing chaos in opposition defences. With Rooney alongside them, they are flourishing. This was undoubtedly one of Sterling’s best games in an England shirt: he read Rooney’s pass to score and later sent in the left wing cross for Harry Kane’s debut goal.

Raheem Sterling stole in at the near post to tuck the ball home for England's third against Lithuania

Sterling is forming a impressive understanding with Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck

Sterling’s double nutmeg on Tomas Mikuckis and Marius Zaliukas, all completed in the same 18th minute move, was outrageous.

Lionel Messi did something similar to James Milner during Barcelona’s totalising of Manchester City in the Champions League and the world went into meltdown. Sterling likes the trick, too.

Welbeck was also one of England’s most prominent players, an increasing influence on this team as they head towards Euro 2016. He has the trust of his manager.

Unfortunately Welbeck will probably miss the game against Italy because of a knee injury and Sterling is heading back to Liverpool for an injection on a long-standing toe injury.

2 SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT

England dropped to 17th in the FIFA world rankings earlier this month and yet the support for the national team is unwavering, even on a Friday night and against opposition as poor as Lithuania.

England supporters were even singing ‘Roy Hodgson’s barmy army’ after Wayne Rooney had scored his 47th goal for his country against Lithuania.

This was close to a full house at the national stadium for a routine victory, England’s fifth successive win in this qualification campaign.

England fans flocked to Wembley on Friday night despite the latest in a long line of mediocre opposition

The atmosphere remains a problem and the FA would do well to change the playlist to whip up the Wembley crowd before the two teams emerge from the tunnel before kick-off.

They did at least turn to old favourite Carnaval de Paris, but what’ s wrong with a bit of tub-thumping by playing some of the other terrace anthems, such as New Order’s World in Motion and the Lightning Seeds’ Three Lions? Bring them back. 

3 PLAN FOR THE FUTURE

Roy Hodgson would have offered his resignation if England lost their opening group game against Switzerland last September, but they emerged with a positive 2-0 victory from that tricky night in Basle.

Suddenly this emerging team has momentum, stringing together victories and establishing a winning mentality in that England dressing room.

Roy Hodgson must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at Euro 2016

We have seen this before, with England unbeaten in their last two qualifying campaigns for Euro 2012 and World Cup 2014. Sadly, we know what happened the moment England ran into some opposition with real pedigree and class.

Hodgson must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at the tournament next summer.

England have plenty of possession in games against Lithuania, but will they dominate territorially against world champions Germany, hosts France or Spain? Hodgson, who has the backing of his players in this qualification campaign, must plan accordingly if the national team is to avoid a repeat of the performance in Brazil.

4 NEW BOYS SHINE

The options appear to be increasing for Hodgson as this team beds in for the qualifying campaign, selecting a starting eleven with players from eight different clubs (Manchester City, Southampton, Everton, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Aston Villa).

Manchester United and Liverpool are well represented on the field, but props to right back Nathaniel Clyne and central midfielder Fabian Delph for forcing their way into the first team ahead of some established, international players. Delph, who worked hard alongside Michael Carrick and Jordan Henderson in the centre of England’s three man midfield, was denied his first international goal by the brilliance of Giedrius Arlauskis in goal for Lithuania.

Clyne is an accomplished player and he has been a breath of fresh air in his opening three games for his country. All three - Slovenia, Scotland and Lithuania - have resulted in victories.  

Fabian Delph has managed to force his way into the England side ahead of some more established players

5 TRUE TEST IN TURIN

Roy Hodgson firmly believes that he has put the nightmare of last summer’s World Cup in Brazil behind him, but their next opponents will provide a brutal reminder of the past in their next game.

England were beaten 2-1 in Manaus in their opening group game and were out of the tournament after another defeat, against Uruguay in Sao Paulo.

On Tuesday, England head to Turin for a prestige friendly against Antonio Conte's side, but much has changed in the Italian camp since the World Cup.

Eder (centre) was born in Brazil but now has Italian citizenship and could face England next week

Mario Balotelli, who scored Italy’s 50th minute winner in the Arena de Amazonia on June 15 2014, has been told he will never be selected again under their new coach.

Instead Italy, who play Bulgaria on Saturday in a Euro 2014 qualifier, are stitching together a new side under the former Juventus coach.

FA chairman Greg Dyke won’t like the look of it, that’s for sure: Palermo forward Franco Vazquez was born in Argentina and Eder, who plays for Sampdoria in Serie A, was born in Brazil. They now have Italian citizenship and are both in the Italy squad.

Expect Hodgson and Dyke to have their say when we get to Turin.
