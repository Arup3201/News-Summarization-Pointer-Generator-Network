Sandwiched between a Starbucks and a charity shop and filled with overflowing rubbish bins, this dank and dingy alleyway is far from the perfect home.

But the unusual south London plot captured the imagination of one buyer desperate for a place in the city and fetched £260,000 at auction.

The narrow lane, which measures 900sq. ft, on Northcote Road in Battersea was snapped up for more than five times its guide price of £55,000 when it went up for sale earlier this week.

Cramped: The passageway is between a Starbucks and a charity shop on Northcote Road in Battersea. The narrow lane, which is partially covered, fetched more than five times its original guide price at auction

Filthy: The alleyway, which sold for £260,000 at auction is currently used as a dumping ground for rubbish

Dingy: A view of the road from inside the alleyway reveals just how dark it is beneath the brick archway

Neat and narrow: This site plan from Wandsworth Council shows the alleyway, circled, wedged between two other retail sites. Planning permission allows for the construction of a first-floor extension

The new owner will be hoping to transform the dark passageway into something more appealing. 

Planning permission included in the price means that it can be converted to a comfortable residential space and there is even suggestion that it could be used as an artist's studio.

And while the neat site does not come with any outdoor space - the bustling south London road is just a short walk to both Clapham and Wandsworth Commons.  

In an online description, Savills Auctions said: 'Local amenities are available along the length of Northcote Road, including its popular street market.' 

Planning permission granted by Wandsworth Council allows for the construction of a first-floor extension beneath the covered portion of the alleyway that can extend out to the open-air rear. 

The building work means that the new owner could build a comfortable 900sq. ft home, a spacious artist's studio - or a combination of the two. 

To keep the new property on the busy south London road safe, the planning permission also allows for the installation of entrance gates and a ground-floor lobby.  

Chris Coleman Smith, director of Savills Auctions, told the Evening Standard that he was only a 'little bit' surprised by the amount the alleyway sold for as it had 'attracted a lot of interest'.

He said: 'This is a classic example of a property finding its value in the auction room. The area around the property is red hot. 

'We have sold all sorts of stuff over the years but this is maybe one of the most unique lots.'

At £260,000, the partially-covered alleyway comes in at just £15,000 less than the average current value of a home in the UK - which comes in at £275,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. 

For the same price, property-hunters could buy a five-bedroom detached home in picturesque Yorkshire or a spacious four-bedroom semi-detached home in Suffolk.   

The purchase of the narrow street is the latest in a string of extraordinary London property deals. 

Last month, Britain's smallest home, which is less than half the size of an average train carriage and measures just 188 sq. ft, was sold for more than a quarter of a million pounds.

Room to improve: The new buyer will be allowed to develop both the area beneath the archway and the small open-air section at the back of the service package, seen in the picture above 

Rubbish real estate: Disused cardboard boxes and waste from nearby businesses line the floor of the alleway

Dank: In this picture taken of the alleyway this week, the property looks far from a comfortable place to live

The tiny flat in Islington, north London - which is so compact that the front door opens underneath the bed - went on sale for £275,000 and was bought after an extraordinary amount of interest.

And earlier this month, a one-car garage off the King's Road in Chelsea, central London, measuring just 11ft by 7ft, became the UK's most expensive garage when it sold for £550,000. 

For the same price, property hunters could buy a pretty semi-detached home with a garden in Suffolk. The quaint vine-covered house boasts four bedrooms and a 'cottage-style garden'. 

Further north, £260,000 would fetch a five-bedroom detached home in a picturesque Yorkshire village. And the buyer would have enough money leftover to make sure that upgrades could be made. 

While those looking to maintain a metropolitan lifestyle could look at the outskirts of Manchester - where £260,000 is enough for a four-bedroom family home with a garage and beautiful conservatory.

Or, if the potential buyer wanted to stay closer to London, £250,000 could buy a two-bedroom bungalow in the popular commuter town of Woking, Surrey - less than an hour from central London by train.
