A member of the British 'doom core' heavy metal band Black Tongue has been seriously injured after falling from his speeding tour bus when he mistook the exit for a toilet door.

Lead singer Alex Teyen, 23, suffered head and facial injuries and was rushed to hospital after opening the door of the tour bus while it was travelling along a Polish motorway en route to the German capital Berlin.

Local police said the Hull-based rocker was 'probably under the influence of alcohol' at the time, adding that his wounds are not life-threatening and he is expected to make a full recovery.

The incident has drawn comparisons with the fictional hard rock band  in the 1984 mockumentary 'This Is Spinal Tap', which lampooned rock'n'roll excesses and the antics of heavy metal musicians.

The accident occured shortly after the band left Warsaw on the 400 mile journey to the German capital, where Black Tongue were scheduled to play a concert the following evening.

It is understood that Teven told his bandmates that he was getting up to go to the toilet, only to find that the cubicle was already engaged. Seconds later he opened the exit door and stepped out while the bus was still speeding along the motorway.

Teven's bandmates realised what happened a short time later and stopped the coach. They found their bandmate laying injured at the side of the and administered first aid, while a local who spoke 'broken English' called the emergency services, according to the Telegraph. 

Local police spokesman Officer Piotr Kaciak told the newspaper: 'Judging by the manner of the victim's behaviour, speech and smell we suspect he was under the influence of alcohol.'

Family members in Hull said Teven's father had travelled to Poland to help his 'battered and bruised' son return to the UK. They added that the musician's condition was 'okay'.

Black Tongue's most successful release today is 2014's five-track, 25-minute long EP 'Born Hanged', which includes songs such as 'Purgatory', 'Coma', and 'Foreshadow'.

The band's 'Ashes to Ashes European Tour 2015' was only five dates in at the time of Sunday's incident, with the band now having missed dates in Berlin and Hamburg. 

Black Tongue were scheduled to perform in the Dutch city of Numegen this evening and in Paris tomorrow on a Europe-wide tour that would have seen them perform every evening until the end of the month.

The band have not yet released a statement on whether they plan to resume their tour once Teven has recovered.
