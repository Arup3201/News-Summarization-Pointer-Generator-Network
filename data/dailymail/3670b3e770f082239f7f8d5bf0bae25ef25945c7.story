A furious husband has criticised the new NHS 111 phone service after his wife was left for 14 hours awaiting medical help - and is now fighting for her life in intensive care.

Geoffrey Peace, 80, rang the new phone service at 8am on March 31 when his wife Sheila fell ill, and was told that a doctor could be with him within four hours.

But it wasn't until 10pm that night that a doctor finally turned up - calling an ambulance and rushing 78-year-old Mrs Peace to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where she was put on dialysis suffering from kidney failure.

Mr Peace has now hit out at the new service, telling how he rang four times between his first call at 8am and the doctor's arrival - only to be infuriated by a machine message telling him his call was in a queue.

Angry: Geoffrey Peace is furious after he called the new NHS 111 helpline when his wife Sheila fell ill - and it took doctors 14 hours to respond. Mrs Peace is now fighting for her life after suffering kidney failure

Retired building inspector Geoffrey, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: 'I was very worried about Sheila but every time I rang this new service it was a machine talking at you, you couldn't say anything back.

The grandfather-of-six added: 'It told me I was in a queue of ten callers, so I wasn't going to wait around because I could have been on the phone for hours.

'You put your trust in the medical profession, so you don't want to argue against them, but I think this new system is flawed.

'My wife was very ill when she got to hospital. When I went to see her, I thought she was gone. It was heartbreaking.'

The new 111 advice line is designed to be a cheaper replacement for NHS Direct -
with non-emergency callers with health problems being giving guidance 
on whether they should visit their GP or attend a hospital.

The idea is the new service combines the long-running NHS Direct helpline with local emergency out-of-hours services.

NHS bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out-of-hours 
telephone services for GP surgeries will make it easier for patients to 
get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends.

Late diagnosis: When a doctor finally arrived at 10pm that night, Mrs Peace was rushed to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where she was put on dialysis, suffering from kidney failure

Mr Peace explained
he had originally been told that a doctor could be with him within four
hours - and if no-one had appeared, he was to phone back.

Despite repeated attempts, he could not get through, nor could his daughter.

He said: 'We were obviously getting more and more concerned throughout the day. I could have called an ambulance myself but I thought the doctors knew best, and I thought we'd be stuck waiting in A&E for hours.

'At about 10pm the doctor turned up, he examined Sheila and told me he would stabilise her but then told me her blood sugar level was low so he called an ambulance to rush her to hospital.

'Her kidneys have failed and she's now on dialysis.'

Mrs Peace, a retired van driver, suffers from diabetes. She is said to be improving but is still attached to drips.

Mr Peace added: 'It makes people very unsure about what's the best thing to do. It's very frustrating and I think they really ought to change things back to the old system.

'I know Sheila's not the first person to be left like this for hours.'

Colne Valley MP Jason McCartney said he had written to the NHS after receiving other complaints about the service.

He said: "It's unacceptable - I've been through it myself when calling [the previous system] NHS Direct for my own children and it's terribly worrying.

'It's clear there's been problems with the number of calls coming in and patients deserve better.'

A spokeswoman for Yorkshire Ambulance Service, which runs 111 in partnership with Local Care Direct, said: 'We would like to apologise for the distress caused to Mrs Peace and her family following their call to NHS 111.'

The idea is the new service combines the long-running NHS Direct helpline with local emergency out-of-hours services.

Already in operation in 22 NHS regions, 111 is due to ‘go live’ in various areas of the county this month.

Critics say those taking the calls do not need to be medically trained at all, and instead work through computer check lists as callers tell them their symptoms

But organisations such as the British Medical Association have vehemently opposed the new helpline, arguing that those taking the calls do 
not need to be medically trained at all, and instead work through 
computer check lists as callers tell them their symptoms.

They may then be referred to speak on the phone with nurses or doctors if necessary.

NHS Direct was launched in 1998 to provide medical advice round the 
clock in an attempt to reduce the number of patients needlessly turning 
up in A&E.

NHS bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out-of-hours 
telephone services for GP surgeries will make it easier for patients to 
get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends.

With 111, callers will be put through to a call centre worker who will decide if they
need to go to A&E, a GP clinic, a chemist or can get by with 
over-the-phone advice.

The operator can potentially send out an ambulance, put someone straight
through to a nurse, book an out-of-hours GP appointment, or direct the 
caller to a pharmacist or dentist.

In some areas of the country the new service will be run by private 
firms while in others it will be overseen by NHS ambulance service.

As well as claims of potentially fatal conditions being missed, there 
have already been reports of ambulances being sent to people with 
hiccups. 

Some patients using limited 111pilot schemes are already waiting 
several hours for urgent medical advice, while others have been told to 
phone back the following day because there is no one available to talk 
to them.
