It's a symbol of one of history's greatest explorations - when humans first traveled to another world and, when looking back, saw their home planet.

Now the iconic photo of the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, the first manned spacecraft to leave Earth orbit and reach the moon, has been transformed into a video recreating the monumental event now known as 'Earthrise'.

The visualization was made using NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft, which has been circling the moon since 2009, coupled with audio records from the mission itself and the dialogue between astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders and is a celebration of the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 8 flight.

The image was captured on Christmas Eve 1968.

NASA has recreated the iconic Apollo 8 'Earthrise' mission as a video simulation 45 years after the journey took place

The moment: Apollo 8 spacecraft is seen hovering over the moon just as Earth begins to rise up, much to the delight of astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders

We're back: Astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders, the first men to leave Earth orbit, returned to a heroic reception

'This new simulation allows anyone to virtually ride with the astronauts and experience the awe they felt at the vista in front of them,' NASA said, according to NBC.

The visualization draws on numerous historical sources, including the actual cloud pattern on Earth from the ESSA-7 satellite and dozens of photographs taken by Apollo 8, and it reveals new, historically significant information about the Earthrise photographs.

It has not been widely known that the spacecraft was rolling when the photos were taken, and that it was this roll that brought the Earth into view.

The visualization establishes the precise timing of the roll and, for the first time ever, identifies which window each photograph was taken from.

It was December 24 1968 and the first lunar voyagers in all of history were emerging from behind the moon for the fourth time.Â 

The video was created using NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft, which has been circling the moon since 2009 and has been map the surface of the moon in stunning detail

The first Earthrise shot was taken in black and white as the astronauts scrambled to find color film. It was 1968 after all

It was then that Anders first spotted it, the Earth, peeking over the horizon.

'Oh my God! Look at that picture over there!' exclaimed Anders.

'There's the Earth comin' up. Wow, is that pretty!'

What followed was an impromptu photo opportunity, first in black and white and then after quickly locating the proper film cartridge, in stunning full color.

'In lunar orbit, it occurred to me that, here we are, all the way up there at the moon, and we're studying this thing, and it's really the Earth as seen from the moon that's the most interesting aspect of this flight,' Anders told author Andrew Chaikin for the 2009 book Voices from the Moon.

Apollo 8 in 1968 was the year before Apollo 13, when man walked on the moon

Anders' color photo of the gibbous Earth hanging over the lunar surface was declared one of the 'great images of the 20th century' and among '100 photographs that changed the world' as selected by the editors of TIME and LIFE magazines.

Five months after the Apollo 8 crew returned to Earth, the U.S. Postal Service issued a postage stamp depicting Anders' Earthrise.

But as well known as the photograph became, the details regarding its creation were limited for four decades to the astronauts' anecdotes.

Then Ernie Wright, the project lead with the Scientific Visualization Studio at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, began reassembling the Apollo 8 crew's experience using data returned by LRO.

Friday's video release addressed those issues.

'It just proves what I have long realized - there's always more to discover about Apollo!' Chaikin said.
