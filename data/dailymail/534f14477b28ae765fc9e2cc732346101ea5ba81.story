Seeing the home of a Star Wars icon destroyed on the big screen is bad enough for fans of the sci fi series, but hearing of the site's real life demise left a group so devastated they launched an audacious rescue mission.

After raising £7,000 from fellow fans two Brits joined a team led by Belgian Mark Dermul to Tunisia to save the famous 'igloo' home of Luke Skywalker.

Now Mr Dermul has uploaded a film to YouTube expressing his gratitude to those who helped give up their time and money to see the rundown dome-shaped building get a complete overhaul.

Among the team members was Terry cooper, 42, from the UK who decided to get involved with the renovation project when he heard about the building's plight.

He said: 'It's such an iconic building to fantasy fans. It was going to waste for the sake of a relatively small amount of money and effort to save it.'

The team helped raise cash to preserve the instantly recognisable building, with other film fans sending them on their way saying: 'May the force be with you.'

Terry, of Cardiff, said: 'I last visited the set three years ago and it was sad to see the structure falling into disrepair.

'The degradation of the site was quite dramatic and without work on it could be lost forever.'

Terry is a keen sci-fi writer who has penned the Kangazang! novels - and his first book was narrated for audio by former Dr Who star Colin Baker.
