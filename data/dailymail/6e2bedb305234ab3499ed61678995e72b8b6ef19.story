The Manchester derby will be more like El Clasico, with 14 native Spanish-speaking players due to be involved. 

Eight of United’s first-team squad and six from City are from Spain or Spanish-speaking countries. 

They are David de Gea, Victor Valdes, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera (all Spain), Marcos Rojo, Angel di Maria (both Argentina), Antonio Valencia (Ecuador) and Falcao (Colombia) at United, and Willy Caballero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Sergio Aguero (all Argentina), Jesus Navas and David Silva (both Spain) at City. 

Sergio Aguero will be one of 14 native Spanish-speaking players to feature in the Manchester derby on Sunday

United captain Wayne Rooney (centre) is likely to be just one of nine English-speakers to feature on Sunday

Nine English-speakers are expected to be in the two sides’ respective 18-man squads including England internationals Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Ashley Young, Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart, James Milner as well as Frank Lampard.

Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products.

However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right.

A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row.

Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United 

Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke 

For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag.

But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory.

Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned.

Unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Louis van Gaal's United line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. 

Unless Tyler Blackett (centre) makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs
