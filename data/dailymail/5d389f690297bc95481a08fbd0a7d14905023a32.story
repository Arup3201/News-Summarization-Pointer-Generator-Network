Dreams of leaving school and making it big in London usually consist of breaking into something like TV, banking or politics.

But when Josh Brandon, 21, made the journey three years ago from his home near Aberystwyth in Wales to find his fortune in the capital, his business plan had little to do with stocks and shares or television scripts.

He had already decided to make his living by selling sex to other men. 

Josh, 21, claims he is a successful male escort because of his young looks 

Josh said of his first job after leaving school: 'When I was in Wales and on dating websites, I did kind of know that I was attractive to guys, but then when I moved to London and started going to bars I realised there were lots of people who are attracted to me. 

'So I figured out pretty early on that I could make money from being an escort.

'I don't think that I will do it for many more years, definitely not when I'm 30, but it has paid for my future so far.' 

Since then, the baby-faced 20-something has made almost a million pounds, owns his own cocktail bar in Chelsea, has a book in the pipeline and runs his own website selling sex toys.

He is also the proud recipient of a dubious award: in 2011, he was named Sex Worker Of The Year at the Erotic Awards.

With a few years of work under his belt, he is now putting his efforts into changing the British public's idea about prostitution, claiming it is a career just like any other. 

Josh is widely considered to be one of the most successful escorts of his generation, making hundreds of thousands of pounds a year from the business. 

His youthful appearance and knack for self-promotion means that he can command up to £1,500 a night for his services. 

Josh, 21, shortly after arriving in London from Wales - escorting was his first job in the capital 

'It’s based completely on time, if someone wants to have sex or go on a date or whatever, it’s all based on time, there are no hidden charges

'I don’t usually do a whole week, because people can’t afford it, but sometimes I have gone to places like Miami - I would charge between £10,000 and £12,000 for that. 

'Weekends are more normal, I get those fairly regularly and that’s around £4,000.' 

'The clients are wide-ranging, with some just wanting to have sex,while others would rather do anything but that. 

He said: 'It totally varies, depending on the client, obviously some are just hiring me for sexual services. 

'But then some are hiring me for the whole experience, where we would go out to the theatre or something, then for a meal and back to my place or to their hotel - that’s a boyfriend experience.

'There are the other ones who just want companionship, so they come to my place and we just sit on the couch and have a glass of champagne or a cup of tea and we just sit there and talk.  

Josh Brandon tried his hand at modelling but only as a sideline to his escort work 

'For those kinds of people it’s a confidence thing - if some of them haven't come out as gay and are never going to come out, it’s their only outlet to do that kind of thing. 

'Or some of them might be older or even disabled and it has knocked their confidence to go out and meet people, so I'm an easier solution. 

'Then there are the people who just don’t have time to meet people; the business people who are millionaires or billionaires that fly into London and just want convenience, they don’t have time to go on chat rooms or whatever.'  

Those billionaires are the biggest demands when it comes to his time. 

Despite their money, they may still be hiding their sexuality from friends and family, so put heavy restrictions on Josh's time, often making for bizarre situations. 

He said: 'I stayed at the estate of a Russian oligarch for a weekend, which was the biggest eye opener. 

'It had a lake with a boat and 4,000 trees, several outhouses for staff and a garage the size of a townhouse - it made the properties in an episode of Cribs look like they belonged on Benefits Street.

'He offered £3 million to basically buy me, he said that if I lived with him for two or three years, he'd write up a contract, transfer the funds and have everything done legally when it came to making payments.

'I would even have been restricted on where I could go - with breaks to see family and friends "every now and then"'  

I was so insulted and I told him, "When I'm ready to be a millionaire I'll make myself a millionaire thanks." 

'That was the first client and one of a small few I wasn't able to get along with, I refused to meet him . again. 

'I rent my time, body and mind like every other working person does but I don't sell those things for someone to take ownership.' 

Another client even offered to hand over his estate when he died. 

Josh said: 'One guy in New York I met a few times developed a fixation, he even offered to sign his millions over to me in his will and buy me a penthouse in New York to live near him.

'I ended up leaving the country and cutting off all communication because it just got too much.' 

But this job was never going to come without huge risks - he has had several stalkers and after a couple of hairy incidents while working from his Soho flat, he also doesn't keep any sharp objects at home.  

He said: 'I have had situations where I’ve had to throw people out when I thought they might get violent or I thought they had no money.

'You have to be very streetwise - you have to be aware of your surroundings,  I don’t even keep sharp objects or anything that could be used as a weapon in my home.

'I have one sharp knife but will move it whenever a client comes around, so it isn't somewhere obvious. 

Josh works for a charity for sex workers called Ugly Mugs in his spare time

'I've also had a few stalkers, people who have ended up hanging around and even sleeping outside my building.' 

But on the whole, Josh has been incredibly fortunate to have avoided any violent attacks, unlike many sex workers in the UK.

It is for that reason that he now volunteers for a charity called Ugly Mugs, that offers assistance to escorts and prostitutes to protect them from violence. 

He said: 'My side of the charity is about awareness, speaking to escorts when they come to me for advice. 

Not all of us are in it out of choice either, I could leave tomorrow and get another job if I wanted to, but other people don’t have that. 

'And the more I come out and talk about this issue, the more sex workers might be able to come forward and get the help they need.'
