Sir Bradley Wiggins has been treated like a visiting celebrity on his return to the track with Team England.

Although three of Wiggins’ four Olympic golds came in the velodrome, he has been a road specialist for the best part of six years, culminating in his historic Tour de France success in 2012.

He is now back in England’s team pursuit line-up at the Commonwealth Games and pondering another track run at Rio 2016.

Team-mate Ed Clancy said: ‘Brad’s return is definitely a good thing. He’s exciting, he brings a lot of energy, everyone knows he is a character and he is a superstar now, a massive superstar in the world of cycling.

‘When he walked in that first day [of training], we thought we haven’t seen this guy for a while and since we last saw him he’s won the Tour; he’s a big deal these days.

‘I just didn’t want to say anything stupid but he’s dead cool, just like he always was.’
