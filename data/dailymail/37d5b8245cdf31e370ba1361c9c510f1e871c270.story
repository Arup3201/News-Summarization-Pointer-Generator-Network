A New Jersey police officer is being hailed a ‘true hero’ after he ran towards a burning car and pulled out a man trapped inside and dragged him to safety.

Cape May Police Officer Scott Krissinger, 27, saw the burning truck on Monday night on Sunset Boulevard in West Cape May.

He pulled the unconscious driver, Gerald Ferrill, 61, of Mays Landing, out of the car and then went back again to see if there was anyone in the passenger seat.

The incredible rescue was caught on the police officer’s patrol car dash cam.

‘He
didn’t hesitate,’ Cape May Police Captain Rob Sheehan told NBC10. ‘He’s
a hero in every sense of the word and we’re very happy to have him as a
member of our department.’

Krissinger, a seven-year-veteran, says he was just doing his job.

‘I think any of the officers at the Cape May Police Department would’ve done the same thing,’

Krissinger said. ‘I truly do. It just happened to me.’

Ferrill was taken to the hospital where he is in critical, but stable condition.

Witnesses
told police that he was driving his truck with a flat tire and strange 
sounds were coming from the engine area prior to the fire.

‘I
would have to think the driver didn’t have much longer to stay in that 
situation without facing serious bodily injury,’ Captain Sheehan said.

‘We’re very proud of him, obviously. He’s a credit to law enforcement as a whole.’
