Felipe Massa has slated Kevin Magnussen for being 'too aggressive' as the Brazilian's world was turned upside down in Germany.

For the second successive grand prix, Massa's race was brought to a premature end on the opening lap, following a first corner-shunt with McLaren rookie Magnussen.

In the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Massa was unfortunately taken out by Kimi Raikkonen following the Finn's frightening smash into a metal guardrail, with the 33-year-old simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

At Hockenheim, Massa was left in no doubt the impetuosity of youth wrecked his race, resulting in him being flipped over as the accident unfolded.

Mercifully for Massa, the rollbar on top of his Williams did its job, with his car eventually righting itself, allowing him to walk away unharmed.

Massa, though, was left fuming with Magnussen as he said: 'When I turned into the corner suddenly another car hit me on my tyres and just flipped me over.

'It was very strange because I didn't know there was a car there, but Magnussen should know I was there as he was behind.

'For me he was too aggressive. I was doing my line. If you're doing your line and you're in front then the guy behind needs to choose and needs to brake.

'If I see someone then I will consider doing whatever I can to not be involved in an accident, but it was impossible to see him there.

'He could see and he knew there were two cars there. This is not the first time he was in an accident on the first lap.

'Most of the time these young drivers want to win races at the first corner. If you take most accidents, they happen with them.

'I've not spoken to him, but if I do, I'll tell him to take it easy because I'm not the only one losing out, he does as well.

'I hope it's enough for him to understand to take it easy a little bit more in the next race.'

Magnussen, however, felt Massa left him with no room as he said: 'I feel if I'd had somewhere to go there wouldn't have been contact with Felipe.

'I did my best to try and avoid the accident, but there wasn't much else I could do.'

Racing director Eric Boullier also exonerated the 21-year-old Dane, stating: 'Massa was on the outside and probably didn't see Kevin, who was on the inside line and had nowhere to go.

'Kevin was quite blameless in the accident, so it's even more annoying it destroyed his chances of finishing in the top four.'

Disappointment: Massa revealed he 'very frustrated' by the incident

As for Massa's moment when he was rolled over, he conceded that was a scary sensation.

'I've never flipped in a racing car before, only a go-kart, but it was a very strange feeling to see everything upside down,' said Massa.

'But I didn't have any impact, so when the car stopped I was 100 per cent fine, but just so disappointed.'
