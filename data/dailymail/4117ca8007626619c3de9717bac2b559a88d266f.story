Nick Clegg came under furious attack today over his decision to veto Tory plans to crackdown on knife crime.

The
 Deputy Prime Minister said he would not support mandatory jail 
sentences for those caught carrying a knife for the second time.

But he was attacked by listeners to his weekly radio show, the Labour party and Britain's most senior police officer.

Nick Clegg defended his knife crackdown veto on his weekly LBC phone in this morning

Mr Clegg told LBC listeners: 'I don’t 
think everybody, in all circumstances, at all times, should be chucked 
into prison when they are found carrying a knife the second time, 
regardless of the circumstances.'

Teacher Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds last week. Her tragic killing has sparked calls for a crackdown on thugs carrying knives

He added: 'All I’m saying is yes, bang people up who should be banged up. Yes, let’s strengthen the law where people threaten you with a knife.

'But saying that someone should always, always, no exceptions at all, end up in prison because they have a pen knife in their pocket, or a knife in their pocket having had a previous knife related offence I think that actually would rebound on us.'

But one caller to Mr Clegg's weekly radio phone in on LBC, introduced as 'John in Wallingham' demanded to know how many times people needed to be caught carrying a blade before they were punished.

Referring to the Deputy Prime Minister, he added: 'How are elderly people meant to sleep in their beds when you’ve got lunatics in suits like him who are looking after this country?'

He then accused Mr Clegg of being soft on crime because it allowed the legal profession to make money defending criminals.

John said: 'You’ve created these monsters out there - you like it. You’ve got all your lawyer mates all earning money out of it, the system. Legal Aid, help all the criminals Clegg.'

A shocked Mr Clegg, whose wife Miriam earns a reported £500,000 a year as a lawyer, responded: 'Right.'

The attack on Mr Clegg came as Britain's most senior police officer, Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe, said it was 'vital' that knife crime was tackled.

Labour leader Ed Miliband also suggested that Labour will back the Tory proposal, leaving Mr Clegg powerless to block it.

The Labour leader told the BBC: 'I don't agree with Nick Clegg. I think we do need tougher penalties for knife crime.

'Labour's been consistently arguing that this is an issue that needs to be looked at.

'We definitely do want to use the legislation to strengthen the law and we are definitely sympathetic to the issue of mandatory sentences after a second offence, after conviction for a second offence.

'We need to make sure it's done in the right way, but that's where we stand, because I think the public want to know that we are going to send a strong message to people who carry knives repeatedly that it is not acceptable.'

Mr Miliband's remarks echoed Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard who said mandatory jail sentences for carrying a blade, being pushed by the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, would send a clear message to youngsters.

Sir Bernard said the policy had worked with gun crime and could have the same effect in reducing the number of stabbings.

But Mr Clegg accused the Tories of exploiting the tragic death of teacher Ann Maguire to look tough on crime.

He
 claimed new proposals to automatically jail anyone twice caught 
carrying a knife were 'headline grabbing' politics that could force 
judges to lock up innocent teenagers.

The Deputy PM said the move would be a
 'step backwards' - creating hardened criminals out of youngsters who 
had got themselves caught up with the wrong crowd.

But Sir Bernard, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, told LBC: 'For me, it's vital we send a clear message to our young people.'

He added: 'They do hear simple messages. They have heard it about guns, I think they need to hear it about knives.'

Mr Clegg responded: 'The 
police, quite understandably, often say they want new powers on the 
statute book and often politicians and Parliament say 'hang on a minute,
 we don't just constantly put new offences on the statute book without 
considering the knock on effect on the prison population, on rates of 
re-offending.

'Now 
Bernard Hogan-Howe, for instance, said well, of course, sometimes people
 might wander out of their home with a knife on them and not really 
remember and they have done it innocently.

'The point is, under this arrangement that person would end up in prison because there are no extenuating circumstances.'

He
 added: 'Yes, let's be really tough on knife crime but let's be smart 
about how we are tough on knife crime. Let's not just simply catch 
headlines in a way which doesn't necessarily deal with the problem.'

The
 Deputy Prime Minister insisted he was 'not soft on knife crime at all' 
and wanted to 'bang people up who should be banged up'.

He said young girls are often forced 
to carry knives for gang leaders and it was not right to
 automatically lock them up.

Mr
 Clegg said forcing judges to imprison anyone caught with a knife would 
undermine their ability to weigh up the facts of each case.

Writing in the Guardian,
 the Deputy PM said: 'Everybody has been shaken by the death of Ann 
Maguire and the notion that any teacher should lose their life in the 
classroom. It was especially poignant because she was clearly such a 
widely respected and loved teacher.

'But
 in the aftermath of terrible events such as this we have to be careful 
that we don't simply reach for headline-grabbing solutions that don't 
necessarily work in practice.'

The Lib Dem leader's explosive remarks threaten to spark a fresh Coalition row.

Mr
 Clegg's implication that Mr Grayling's proposals 
are designed to win political points are likely to infuriate the Tories.

Today's
 row comes just a week after Mrs Maguire, 61, died after being stabbed 
by a teenage student at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds. A 15-year-old boy has been charged with her murder.

Under Mr Grayling's proposal offenders caught twice with a knife to face an automatic six-month jail term.

He wants mandatory jail sentences to be introduced through an 
amendment to the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which returns to the 
Commons on May 12.

Mr
 Clegg's intervention comes despite the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, 
the most senior judge in England and Wales, calling for an urgent review
 of sentencing for youths carrying knives. He said it was a 'major 
problem' among 12 to 14-year-olds.

The country's top judge, Lord Chief Justice Sir John Thomas, told peers an urgent review of sentencing for youths carrying knives was needed

But Mr Clegg wrote that the proposed legislation might not work in practice.

He said: 'When someone is caught carrying a knife, we need to do something about it. But six months in prison is not always the right answer.

'Imagine a vulnerable young girl hanging around with members of a gang.

'She could be forced into carrying a knife by another gang member; it happens a lot. When stopped by the police, she doesn't mention that she was forced to carry the knife, fearing retribution from the gang.

'Putting someone like that into prison could push them into the arms of hardened criminals, and let the gang leaders off the hook. Instead of prison, we need to divert vulnerable young people away from gang culture.'

He called for decisions on sentencing to be left to judges so as not to undermine the justice system, saying: "This is why I believe this proposed law would be a step backwards.

'It would undermine the government's progress in establishing a rehabilitation revolution and reducing crime. We need to treat knife crime very seriously by letting judges choose the sentence to fit the crime.

'Turning the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow is not the answer.'
