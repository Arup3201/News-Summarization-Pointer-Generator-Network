Archie Brooks admitted common assault after his glass struck his colleague's face

A 'loutish' recruitment consultant who glassed a workmate in the face claiming his drink had slipped from his grasp was fined in court today.

Archie Brooks, 21, attacked Olivia Parish in a City of London bar after the two had attended an afternoon meeting that included alcohol.

After they had rowed Mr Brooks's glass struck his colleague in the face - but he insisted he had only meant to throw ice and drink at her.

Ms Parish needed stitches for the cut to her lip after she was struck last March 30 and Brooks was sacked from his £32,000-a-year job.

He was due to stand trial for assault occasioning actual bodily harm but prosecutors accepted a plea to a lesser charge of common assault before a jury was sworn in.

He was handed a £1,000 fine and ordered to pay £250 compensation to his victim and £100 towards court costs.

Judge Stephen Kramer QC told him: ‘You behaved drunkenly and loutishly and your conduct resulted in a nasty injury.

‘Those who behave in that way, in those sort of circumstances in this city can normally expect a custodial sentence.’

Both Brooks and Ms Parish worked for London-based Coal IT, and sat close to each other in the firm’s Jewry Street offices.

They attended a boozy meeting on the day of the attack, before heading to The Abbey bar in nearby Minories with other workmates.

‘There was always banter between the two of them,’ said prosecutor Katrina Charles.

‘But on this occasion the language was abusive.’

Their exchanges culminated with Brooks’ tumbler glass striking the victim in the face, she added.

When he was arrested he told police he had only intended to embarrass Ms Parish by throwing the remnants of his drink over her.

‘But that glass went flying from his hand,’ said Ms Charles.

Brooks pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault on that basis, she added.

He lost his job, which offered bonuses of up to £8,000 for every transaction, after the attack and is in the process of setting up his own clothing firm, the court was told.

The judge said Brooks’ age, guilty plea and good character meant he had avoided a more serious sentence.

Brooks, of Redbridge, east London, denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm but admitted common assault.
