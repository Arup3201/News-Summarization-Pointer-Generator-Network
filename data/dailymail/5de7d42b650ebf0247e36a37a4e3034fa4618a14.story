The walking stick always used by ex-Labour leader Michael Foot after the 1963 car crash that nearly claimed his life has been put up for sale by his family.

Michael Foot, who died in 2010 at the age of 96, was often seen using his trusty wooden stick while out walking his dog near his home in Hampstead, London.

Now his family hopes its sale at auction will raise more than £4,000 to help pay for a stone bench memorial in Plymouth in the Devonport constituency he represented for a decade.

Tom Foot said he ‘cannot remember a day’ when his great uncle Michael was not using the trusty support.

The journalist wrote in the Independent: ‘The support of his wife, the film-maker Jill Craigie - and, after she died, of her friend Jenny Stringer, who came every day to check on him in his final 10 years - were perhaps matched in constancy only by this gnarled larch staff.

‘In old age, certainly when I was living with him in the last five years of his life, it would be used to prod out a secure footing on the steps or propel him pole-vault-style into a taxi to the Gay Hussar in Soho.’

Michael Foot was a Member of Parliament from 1945 to 1955 and from 1960 to 1992 and was deputy leader of the Labour Party from 1976 to 1980 later becoming the leader of the opposition from 1980 to 1983.

In October 1963 he was involved in a car crash and suffered pierced lungs, broken ribs, and a broken left leg. It meant he had to use a walking stick for the rest of his life.

Tom Foot revealed that although he may have used a number of walking sticks over the years, the one up for sale was his ‘number one choice’.

A number of the others had been given away to friends and family with one given to novelist Salman Rushdie’s son

Tom Foot added: ‘We think the stick is now best used helping future generations remember what Michael stood for, rather than how he stood.’

The bench, which is set to cost £42,000, is being installed in Freedom Fields park, Plymouth, in the city of his birth and near his childhood home.
