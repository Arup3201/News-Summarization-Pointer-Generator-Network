ISIS morality police attacked a young Syrian woman dressed in a full burkha and face veil - because they thought her eyes were too exposed.

The Al-Merced NGO said the woman was arrested in Albuhamal, in the east of the country, along with two men who tried to protect her.

The charity also claimed women living in Mosul who offended the militant group's strict dress code were being beaten by iron rods, Israel National News reports.

Strict: Women living under ISIS control must abide by rules governing their dress, which is enforced by morality police in each city. The Al-Merced NGO reports one group beat a woman for showing too much eye

Women living  in ISIS-controlled territory in Syria and Iraq are made to follow strict rules, which they claim are based on Sharia law.

The Guardian has reported the group demands women  wear double-layered veils, loose abayas and gloves.

They are also made to go everywhere with a male guardian. 

But it is not just women who are made to live within draconian laws.

Last month, ISIS published a code of conduct - including which horrific punishment went with each crime.

For example, those who commit adultery will be stoned to death if the adulterer was married and lashed 100 times and exiled if he or she was unmarried.

Those engaged in sodomy (homosexuality) will be sentenced to death, along with those who 'spy for the unbelievers'.

Those who steal 'as part of banditry' will have their right hand and left leg cut off, and the punishment for terrorising people is exile. 

Beating: This boy was lashed 60 times for calling ISIS 'Daesh' - a name with negative connotations

People can also be punished for more minor infringements - including a boy last week, who was flogged 60 times for using the word 'Daesh' - a loose acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (al-Dawla Al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham), used by the enemies of ISIS and seen as having negative connotations.

Enforcing the lesser rules - like dress code - is a job given to the morality police.

Last year, it was reported Aqsa Mahmood, 20, of Glasgow, was a key figure behind the morality police in Raqqa, Syria - known as the al-Khanssaa brigade. 

It is thought the women were charged with seeking out people engaging in Western culture in Raqqa.
