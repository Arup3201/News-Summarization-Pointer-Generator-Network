Tuesday night was the most shocked I have ever been in a football stadium. And I was not alone.

All the Brazil fans near our BBC commentary position were stunned, too. There was not much anger — I think that will follow in the coming days — just quiet horror.

Everywhere I’ve gone in the past few weeks I’ve felt the locals’ obsession with this World Cup. And as a visitor to the country, I’ve bought into it.

Misplaced emotion: Brazil let their tributes to their injured star get in the way of their concentration

Passion: Despite all their commitment during the national anthem David Luiz and his team never started playing

You felt you were on a journey with them and waiting for a coronation. Now it is over.

On Tuesday, it seemed that the emotion of winning the World Cup for the people and the furore surrounding Neymar’s injury was all too much for Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side.

When you walk around cities in Brazil you are just a couple of blocks from a favela, from seeing people sleeping and living in the streets, some of them missing limbs.

The players were acutely aware of that. They felt they were playing for the people and there is so much emotion attached to that.

David Luiz really meant it when he said he felt he’d let his country down.

But sport is not about raw emotion, it is about being professional, about concentrating on the job in hand.

Yes, the crowd can be a 12th man, but, in Brazil’s case, the weight of the 12th man was too much to bear.

There was no structure to their system and when you have a bad performance, you need to fall back on your system to avoid disaster.

For Brazil, it was like they had pulled the plug out of the bath.

As if the emotion surrounding the tournament wasn’t enough, the team had whipped themselves up into even more of a frenzy over Neymar and Thiago Silva’s absence.

They wore Neymar hats, left an empty hanger in the dressing room in Silva’s honour and clung on to a Neymar shirt during the national anthem.

But you shouldn’t have to work yourself up for big games — if anything, you need to calm yourself down.

The Germans are masters of that. It’s fine to play for an absent player but not to the extent Brazil did.

Their focus was in the wrong place. You’re out there to play football and you must not think about the scale of it all until the game is over.

Too little, too late: Oscar scored a consolation for the host nation in the dying minutes but it was pointless

The signs were there against Colombia in the quarter-final.

As a kid I remember booting the ball into touch and getting told off: ‘Brazil would never do that,’ my coach told me. Well, they did against Colombia and the crowd were applauding it.

They were headless, unable to cope with the mass hysteria. And on top of that, the squad was simply not good enough.

They are a million miles off the 2002 squad of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho,  Roberto Carlos and Rivaldo.

But the fans and media still believed — they turned Luiz into their new hero and it backfired.

The fans wanted to win the World Cup so much but I got the feeling they just wanted to be champions without having to endure the matches.

Support: Luiz was keen to back his injured teammate but not so ready to do his job on the pitch

They didn’t want to go the hard miles and every match just became an emotional ordeal.

Scolari must take a lot of the blame, too. Last year, his team beat Spain to win the Confederations Cup. They have gone downhill since.

I’m all for loyalty with your players but why did he keep playing Paulinho after an average season at Tottenham and Fred, when the rest of the world can see he is not good enough?

Scolari would have been better off experimenting more last summer so he knew how to handle things when the injuries and suspensions came.

And he was wrong to leave Kaka out of the squad. He needed someone to calm the young players, to teach them how to behave.

Mentally shot: Brazil were unable to cope with the emotions of the occasion as their World Cup dream died

There weren’t many yellow shirts out in Brazil on Wednesday.

Football is what Brazil is most proud of. They have more than 800 professional clubs, export their players to the top leagues in Europe and yet they couldn’t get an XI together to win the trophy on home soil.

They are in a similar boat to England now — they have to rebuild and look at the good things that countries like Germany and Holland are doing.

What a sorry end to their World Cup.
