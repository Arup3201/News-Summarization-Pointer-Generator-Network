Bailed: Eric Joyce left Belgravia police station without comment this evening after spending 20 hours in police custody. He was bailed to return at a later date in March after being arrested during a fracas in the Houses of Parliament

The predecessor to MP Eric Joyce, who was arrested last night during a fracas in the Houses of Parliament, has branded him 'arrogant' and demanded he resign.

A dozen police officers were called to a
 fracas at the Sports and Social bar in the Houses of Parliament last 
night, where Eric Joyce was at a karaoke night.

The MP for Falkirk, who now serves as an independent after he was forced out of the Labour Party, was reportedly wrestled to the ground by officers in front of onlookers and loaded into a police van.

Mr Joyce has now been banned from buying or being served alcohol anywhere in the Palace of Westminster.

He left Belgravia police station without comment this evening, speaking only to say he had not been charged, after spending 20 hours in police custody.

He was bailed to return to a central London police station on a later date in March, the Metropolitan Police said.

Police said the MP, who was initially arrested on suspicion of assault, was further arrested while in custody on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The 52-year-old former soldier was arrested last February over a brawl at the nearby Strangers’ bar in Parliament where he headbutted Tory MP Stuart Andrew.

He pleaded guilty to four counts of common assault and was fined £3,000 by magistrates. 

A House of Commons spokesman said: 'The 
Serjeant at Arms has confirmed that yesterday evening the Member for 
Falkirk was detained following a disturbance on the Parliamentary 
Estate.

'The House authorities take their responsibility for the welfare of 
those who work in and visit the Commons estate very seriously. The 
authorities promote responsible alcohol use and have policies in place 
to encourage staff and Members to consume alcohol accordingly.

'Alcohol-related incidents on the Estate are rare, and the serious incident last night was counter to the policies in place.

Dennis Canavan has called for the MP to resign and that the incident was embarrassing

'Given the Member for Falkirk has previously been found guilty of an 
alcohol-related incident on the Parliamentary Estate, the Speakers and 
House authorities have agreed that with immediate effect the Member for 
Falkirk will be prohibited from purchasing and being served alcoholic 
beverages from all Parliamentary facilities. This ban will be indefinite
 subject to the outcome of police investigations.'

Predecessor Dennis Canavan, today said Mr Joyce he should to 'do the decent thing' and resign his seat immediately.

Mr Canavan, 70, speaking at his home 
near Stirling, said: 'It's a sad situation. It's sad for Eric Joyce but 
it's even sadder for the people of Falkirk.

'For over a year now they have had no effective representation in Parliament and they don't deserve this.

'I
 said last year it was time to go for the sake of his constituents and 
for his own sake, because obviously he has a serious problem and he 
needs help, and he needs to seek help.

'Being a member of parliament can be very stressful at times, and it requires someone who is fit for the job.

'His serial misconduct shows that he is not fit for the job.

'He has brought himself into disrepute, he has brought Parliament into disrepute, and he has brought Falkirk into disrepute.

'He should do the decent thing and go now.

'He is just a huge embarrassment, and is
 incapable of doing his job. I am sure the majority of people in Falkirk
 and in Scotland would agree with me.'

Last night onlookers at the Sports and Social said Mr Joyce brought two officers to the ground and knocked another’s hat off.

It is believed he arrived at the venue earlier in the evening after drinking in a Westminster pub with one of his staff.

Initial
 reports suggest an altercation began between Mr Joyce and another man, 
which was continued outside the bar. Witnesses called the police who 
arrived at 10.45pm.

They had to call for reinforcements to deal with the incident. Mr Joyce was eventually pinned him to the ground and handcuffed.

He was said to have been bundled through the members’ entrance to the Palace of Westminster and driven away.

One
 witness, Robin Lines, 31, a student who was at the bar as a guest of a 
friend, told the Mail Mr Joyce had an altercation with another customer 
inside the bar.

He said
 a police officer arrived and spoke to the customer who walked outside 
but Mr Joyce followed them both and continued the dispute outside.

He
 said: ‘I was standing outside having a cigarette and the next thing I 
knew Eric was on top of both the man from the pub and the policeman. 
Everyone was shouting “Come on Eric, get off him”. Then everyone was 
told to evacuate through the back entrances by police.’

Police closed the bar and interviewed parliamentary staff who witnessed the incident.

A Metropolitan police spokesman said:
 ‘Police were called shortly before 10.30 this evening to reports of a 
disturbance within a bar within the Houses of Commons.

‘Officers
 attended and a man aged in his fifties has been arrested in connection 
with the incident, he remains in custody and inquiries continue.’

Tony Grew, a journalist from the PoliticsHome website, told ITV the incident happened during a karaoke night in the bar, which was packed with about 150 people.

He said Mr Joyce entered the room 'obviously agitated' and pushed his way forward to the bar.

When he followed him out of the bar he saw Mr Joyce on the ground 'wrestling with two police officers'.

'He appeared to have one of the officers in an armlock, he put his arm around the officer's neck, and the other police officer was on top of him,' said Mr Grew.

Speaking
 at a press conference following the European Council summit in 
Brussels, Mr Cameron said he still wanted to introduce 'recall' powers 
to allow voters to oust MPs who misbehave.

Asked
 whether Mr Joyce should be allowed to remain an MP, Mr Cameron said: 'I
 haven't been able to follow every aspect of this story, as I've been in
 a room with my 27 colleagues.

'But
 I do support the recall proposals that were in our manifesto. I still 
think it is right, if we can find a way of putting this in place. I 
think it's an important idea.

'As for Eric Joyce, I think this is 
going to have to be properly looked at and I'm sure that the authorities
 both inside and outside of the House are more than capable of doing 
that.'

One MP last night expressed concern for Mr Joyce’s welfare.

Tory
 Penny Mordaunt wrote on Twitter: ‘MPs done great stuff for mental 
health but must ensure that colleagues who need help get it, esp if they
 are now sans party.’

A 
parliamentary aide who witnessed the incident described scenes of 
‘mayhem’ as Mr Joyce was ‘dragged’ away by police. She said: ‘The bar 
was really busy but everybody pushed outside. Everyone knew what was 
going on.

‘Everyone 
was just saying is it Joycey, is it Joycey?I saw maybe five or six 
officers, the police were so quick, he was pushed to the floor but he 
resisted a lot.

‘I saw him dragged off by three police man, there was one on each side of him holding his elbows and another behind him.

‘It was complete mayhem, police had to wrestle him to the floor, there must have been 50 people stood around outside watching.

‘It
 was like something you would see outside a very raucous bar or club on a
 weekend.’ She said the bar was popular with Commons staffers, 
especially on karaoke nights, but did not usually attract MPs.

Mr
 Joyce resigned from the Labour Party after headbutting Tory rivals Mr 
Andrew and Ben Maney in the incident in a Commons bar last February.

He also punched Tory councillor Luke 
Mackenzie and Labour whip Phillip Wilson while going berserk and abusing
 officers. After leaving Mr Andrew with a bloodied nose, Mr Joyce told 
police: ‘He deserved it.’

The MP, who accepted he was 
‘hammered’ on red wine during the brawl, launched into a frenzied attack
 after shouting that the Strangers’ Bar ‘was full of f****** Tories’. He
 walked away from Westminster Magistrates’ Court with a fine and pub 
banning order after admitting four counts of common assault.

He was fined £3,000 and ordered to pay £1,400 to victims after he entered early guilty pleas.

Mr
 Joyce was also given a 12-month community order – banning him from 
entering pubs and licensed premises for three months – and handed a 
curfew order from Friday to Sunday.

After the hearing, the MP admitted he was lucky to avoid jail and said he was ‘deeply apologetic’.

He served in junior government posts and was shadow Northern Ireland minister in 2010.
