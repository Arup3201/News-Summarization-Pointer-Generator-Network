Headache: The mounting cost of bills will leave the average family £200 worse off next year, experts warn

Hard-pressed British families are now going to be £200 a year worse off until at least 2014, experts warned today.

Rising fuel, energy and mortgage costs are crippling disposable incomes as salaries are not rising enough to keep up with over-inflated prices.

Investment bank Morgan Stanley say that the average UK household is already £50 worse off in 2012 and it will only get more painful, with a total fall in disposable income of £1.3 billlion this year, reaching £5 billion by the end of 2013.

It came after a difficult few weeks for consumers who are already seeing their monthly costs rising at an eye-watering rate.

Only last week SSE, the UK's second biggest energy provider, bumped up its gas and electricity prices by nine per cent.

Defying record-low British interest rates of 0.5 per cent, banking giant Santander put up mortgage rates for some customers with other banks likely to follow suit.

And despite Chancellor George Osborne blocking a fuel duty rise, petrol prices are up sharply in recent weeks and poor weather and increased transport costs also mean supermarkets will probably be increasing the prices of some essentials above rates of inflation.

'With approximately 25 million households in the UK, this would be the equivalent to about £50 less in real income per household in 2012 and £200 less next year,' Morgan Stanley economist Jonathan Ashworth said.

Britain faces a 'winter of misery' because of the cost of heating and lighting a home and the Government is being urged to intervene and block more huge price rises by energy firms, which experts believe are coming.

SSE's nine per cent increase means its eight million gas and electricity customers will pay on average £8.53 a month more from October – taking the average annual bill to £1,274.

Northern Ireland is the only part of Britain where prices are still regulated according to the wholesale costs of gas, electricity and coal.

This autumn prices for some there are likely to drop by 14 per cent, according to Power NI, and hold steady next year too.

Last week it was also revealed that Britain is now the tenth most expensive place in the world to fill up your car.

Motorists
in the UK pay more than double the amount American drivers shell out – 
and are hit harder in the pocket than the French, Germans, Belgians and 
Swiss.

The global 
disparities are revealed in Bloomberg's Gas Price Ranking, which takes 
into account average prices at the pumps in 60 countries.

British drivers typically pay £1.32 per 
litre – around 20p more than those filling up on Spanish forecourts. 
Even those in wealthy Switzerland pay 4p less per litre than British 
motorists.
