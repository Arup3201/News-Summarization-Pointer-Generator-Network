Prince William spoke of his love for Australia and described it as 'an uplifting place' during a speech at Australia House in London today.

He went on to speak fondly 
of the people he met during the royal tour last April and described the visit as a 'great pleasure.

'Earlier
 this year, you will know that Catherine and I had the great pleasure of
 spending time, with George, in Australia,' he said.

Tragedy: Prince William spoke of his sadness and offered his sympathy to victims of yesterday's crash

'In South Australia, we visited an organisation that will long live in our memory called the Northern Sound System. 

'There,
 we met young people – some from very difficult backgrounds – who were 
turning their lives around through the power of music.

'The place was Australia at its very best: young, innovative, caring, cool … it was a truly uplifting place.'

Today, with 28 Australians confirmed killed, the country is mourning its dead, among them a nun and three small children.

Ahead of his speech, the Duke offered
 his sympathies to the victims of yesterday's plane crash and said the 
'thoughts and prayers of my family' were with those who lost loved ones 
in the disaster.

He added: 'I know that I speak for all of
 us here when I acknowledge our deep sadness following yesterday's 
disaster in the Ukraine. 

'For all of us who have lost fellow countrymen and women in the tragedy, words cannot do justice to our sense of loss.'

The
 Duke of Cambridge had been invited to Australia House to unveil a 
statue of Captain Matthew Flinders, a British explorer and navigator who
 in 1801 became the first person to circumnavigate the Australian coast.

But
 following yesterday's plane crash, which claimed 298 lives including 
those of 80 children, a sombre Duke spoke instead of his sadness at the 
loss of life and offered his sympathies to grieving families. 

'For
 Australians, and for our Malaysian brothers and sisters in the 
Commonwealth, the crash is a particularly cruel tragedy coming so soon 
after the loss of MH370,' he added.

Tony Abbott in condemning the tragedy, which happened yesterday 
afternoon.

Nine British citizens were killed in the crash, which also claimed the lives of 28 Australians, including three children, and 173 Dutch.

Although the full sequence of events is not yet known, suspicion has fallen on pro-Russian rebels operating around Donetsk.

Russia's President Putin has denied the claims, blaming Ukrainian forces for the tragedy which has claimed 298 lives, including those of 80 children.

Speaking about the tragedy, Mr Abbott offered his 'most profound condolences' to families and said his prayers were with them.

'All I can say is that this would be the grimmest of grim mornings for the family and the loved ones of Australians on that plane,' he told The Today Show.

'Our heart goes out to them, our prayers are with them and whatever assistance we humanly can offer we will because Australians stick by each other in times of trouble.'

Mr Abbott added: 'If it has been brought down by a missile that is an unspeakable crime and we should be filled with revulsion against anything that would do something horrible to innocent people.'

Victim: Briton Glenn Thompson, a spokesman for the World Health Organisation, was killed in the crash

Britain, meanwhile, has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, which will take place today.

David Cameron was also holding crisis talks at Downing Street this morning as world leaders lined up to condemn the disaster.

Arizona senator John McCain warned there would be 'hell to pay', while Canadian premier Stephen Harper laid the blame squarely at Mr Putin's door.

Meanwhile, families of victims have arrived at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport hoping for news as investigations into the crash continue.
