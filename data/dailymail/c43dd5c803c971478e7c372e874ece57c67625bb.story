The weekend’s games were pleasantly free of grappling in the box. Referees didn’t appear to have changed their approach, but players seem to have taken heed of our ‘Hands Off In The Box’ campaign. I understand some managers have warned players of the consequences of grappling. Not all matches were incident-free — as we report here — but there were encouraging signs. 

Stephen Ward (Burnley vs Arsenal) 

Burnley often had nine or 10 in the penalty box and that occasionally resulted in argy bargy. Stephen Ward had his hands wrapped around the waist of Calum Chambers a few times at set pieces. Ward and Dean Marney were both pulling on Chambers’ shirt at a corner in the 72nd minute. Chambers broke away to poke home his debut Arsenal goal.

Dejan Lovren (Newcastle vs Liverpool) 

In the 39th minute — as Martin Skrtel battled with Moussa Sissoko for the ball from a corner — Dejan Lovren blocked Steven Taylor in an attempt to make space for Skrtel.

Sebastien Pocognoli (Leicester vs West Brom)  

West Brom’s Sebastien Pocognoli clearly had both arms wrapped around Jamie Vardy’s torso when Leicester’s Matty James whipped in a corner in the 29th minute. Nothing was given by referee Stuart Attwell. There were no obvious incidents of further penalty-box grappling.

Erik Pieters (Stoke vs West Ham)

Referee Chris Foy had to speak to Carlton Cole and Asmir Begovic after both reacted angrily following a tussle in the box before a West Ham set-piece. Cole pushed Erik Pieters away after the Stoke defender wrapped his arms around the striker and Begovic intervened.
