Coleen Rooney has 
worked diligently to get her figure back to peak condition since the 
birth of her second son in May, and the results speak for themselves.

But while the 27-year-old's earlier physical transformations have largely been down to hard work in the gym, this time round Coleen has had a bit of a helping hand at a local clinic.

The Liverpudlian wife of Wayne Rooney has revealed that she has been undergoing 3D lipo - a £999 treatment that claims to melt fat away.

The mother-of-two revealed on Twitter: 'Started my 3D lipo course today @Malinki_Brows. Thanks girls, enjoyed the treatment xx'.

Her message, which has since been deleted, was retweeted by the Liverpool-based salon and uploaded to their Facebook page.

The treatment, which is on offer exclusively at Malinki Cosmetics in Coleen's northern hometown, is also favoured by fellow WAG, Alex Gerrard.

It combines Cavitation, which converts fat cells into liquid which can then be naturally drained by the body's own filtration system, as well as a body sculpting treatment called Cryolipolysis.

Speaking to MailOnline, Hayley Mack, 
joint salon director of Malinki Cosmetics, where Coleen has been 
receiving the treatment, said: 'Coleen heard about the system through our
other clients in her circle of friends.

'She contacted us about it and we invited her in for an in-depth consultation about what she wanted to achieve.

Hotting up: The 3D system heats skin up to 41 degrees and melts the fat, which is excreted through the liver. It also helps tighten the skin, claims Hayley Mack who has the device in her salon

'She's been coming in for about four weeks now for the full treatment.

'The 3D system heats skin up to 41 degrees and melts the fat, which is excreted through the liver. It also helps tighten the skin.'

The new system, which claims to give 'instant results' of 5-6cm loss per session, also maintains that there is no downtime.

Dr Dennis Wolf, Cosmetic Doctor at The Private Clinic, said: 'In recent months we have seen the emergence of many non-invasive treatments such as this one.

'However, since this is a non-invasive procedure, which does not involve physically extracting the fat from the body, the operator does not have much control over how much fat is removed.

'With procedures where the fat is physically removed however, such as VASER liposuction, the surgeon has control over where, to what extent and how much fat is removed. The areas can also be contoured with extraction techniques. 

'It is necessary to ask the question, "if fat is not actually being removed from the body, where is it going?"

Tweet tweet: Coleen tweeted about using the machine, which was recommended to her by personal trainer, Elise Lindsay

'I would also advise that patients 
who, like Coleen, have recently given birth, wait some time before 
opting to undergo any form of procedure which seeks to target body fat.

'With pregnancy, weight gain is an inevitability and so the body needs time to re-adjust after birth.

'Diet
 and exercise are, first and foremost, the most important methods of 
weight loss post-pregnancy.

In time, a cosmetic procedure to target 
stubborn areas of excess fat may well be suitable, but I would advise 
the patient to wait until their weight has stabilised before undergoing 
such a procedure.'

This isn't the first time that Coleen has experimented with weight loss methods to shift the pounds.

In June she revealed that she got in shape for a friend's wedding by embarking on a gruelling juice diet and has also admitted to using Technoshape - a fat-blitzing stomach belt - to rid her post baby stomach after giving birth to baby Klay.

Daniel Young, 47, had 3D-Lipo because he said he 'didn't have time to exercise'. The businessman from Malvern, who has two children, had 11 treatments which cost £45 a session.

He told MailOnline: 'I used to be 17st and dropped two stone after changing my diet and cutting out carbs. But I still had fat around my middle that I couldn't shift. I couldn't restrict my diet anymore and as I'm always working, I didn't have time to exercise.

'So I tried this instead as each session doesn't take long and it's not an invasive procedure.'

Since having the treatment, Daniel said his waist measurements have shrunk from 44/46 inches to 34 inches.
