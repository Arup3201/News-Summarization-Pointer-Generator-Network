She is one of the most petite actresses in Hollywood, famed for her toned physique.

But size 6 Jessica Alba, 32, is on a mission to convince the world she is just like the rest of us as she claims to suffer a multitude of body hang-ups including stretch marks, cellulite and a muffin top.

'Let's face it, I don't have the body of a 14-year-old anymore,' said Alba. 'I think the more we try not to have that unrealistic ideal, the happier we'll be.'

Speaking to Women's Health magazine, the actress confessed: 'I have cellulite and stretch marks - and I have a muffin top!'

But her fans will be hard pushed to spot any of these complaints, even after two children her washboard stomach and slim limbs remain perfectly sculpted.

Indeed, while she no doubt wants to identify with her fans, it is likely to irritate rather than endear them to her.

Eloise Parker, a pop culture expert on Entertainment Tonight, says it is surprising to hear the actress making these comments.

Open: Jessica opened up about her body in the interview

She told MailOnline: 'I
was on the beach next to Jessica Alba in Mexico earlier this year. She 
definitely turned heads with her long, lean limbs and flawless skin, 
playing with her kids in her tiny bikini.

'In fact, I not only admired 
her stunning figure, but also her confidence in showing it off, so it 
surprising to hear her make these comments.

'Perhaps she's trying to sound 
humble, but if an actress renowned for her fabulous body can't 
appreciate her good looks, it just makes it even harder for regular 
women, who are inspired by girls like Jessica, to feel good about 
themselves.'

Alba claims 
that she finds exercise too boring and struggles to keep up with her 
fitness regime: 'I have a brutally short attention span. It means I'm 
useless at working out. I get so bored.'

The star has previously confessed to 
spending three months strapped into two girdles following the birth of 
her second child, Haven.

'It was brutal; it's not for everyone,' she said speaking with Net-A-Porter magazine.

'I wore a double corset day and night for three months. It was sweaty, but worth it.'
