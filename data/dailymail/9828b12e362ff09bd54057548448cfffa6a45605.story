Sam Burgess will make his grand entrance into a whole new ball-game on Friday night, having realised in recent weeks that he faces a monumental task in crossing the rugby divide.

The 25-year-old Yorkshireman has come home from Australia as a feted, decorated league icon — World Player of the Year and a man whose c.v. now features comic-book heroism in a title-winning cause. But under the lights of The Rec, against Harlequins, he will be a union rookie leaping into the unknown.

Since arriving in the West Country last month, Bath’s high-profile recruit has been recovering from facial surgery and undergoing a rapid induction into his new code. He has made sufficient progress to be considered for a debut off the bench, amid the maelstrom of an Aviva Premiership encounter.

Burgess hasn't played a competitive match since the NRL grand final in October

After initial fitness work and weight training, several days in the ‘padded cell’ at Farleigh House gave Burgess an insight into such alien arts as ruck-clearing and ball-presentation. Then, as the intensity increased, he realised that although he was fit to play again, he could expect a tough education.

‘The only way to test it more now is to play,’ he said. ‘There’s a lot to take in, but the best way for me to learn is on the field, so I’ve been pushing to get back as quickly as possible. I’m nowhere near to fully understanding the game yet. I’m still a novice. I’m definitely not going to go out and break records, but hopefully I won’t look too out of place!

‘I’m not nervous, but I’m anxious to see how it goes. I’ve watched so much footage and I just want to have a crack at it.’

There has been great intrigue about the positional deployment of Burgess, given England’s desire to unleash him in midfield. So far at Bath, he has been getting up to speed with the varied roles of centre and back-rower, though he will be a centre replacement tomorrow night. ‘I’m trying to cover all bases,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where I’m going to play.

‘In time, I will find a place which works best for the team. I might not be able to do what everyone thinks I can do. I might not get the best out of my game at 12; that might happen in a different position. In time, we’ll see.’

Given his profile and reputation, there is huge interest in how Burgess progresses in union, with the 2015 World Cup looming. The England coaches would like him on board and the fans might eagerly anticipate that scenario, but he faces an arduous transition.

‘When I first thought about coming to union, I thought about England and the World Cup,’ added Burgess — the ‘face’ of Canterbury’s new fashion range, which launches next year. ‘It was something I really wanted to aim for. But since I’ve got here it’s just been Bath, Bath, Bath, Bath, Bath. I’ve watched the autumn internationals and I’d love to be part of them but being here now, I know how hard it’s going to be to make the conversion.

‘I’ll give it my best shot, that’s all I can say. I would love to represent my country, I’ve wanted to do it since I was a kid and now I have changed careers, I’ve realised it is going to be a tough task. 

'I’m not writing myself off, I’m just saying that I now understand how hard these guys work to be doing what they’re doing. I’ve got so much to learn. Whether I can do it fast enough, that’s the challenge. We’ll see what happens, but on Friday night, I definitely won’t be thinking about England.’

Burgess believes he must concentrate on playing union before thinking of an England call-up

- Born on December 14 1988 in West Yorkshire to a rugby league player father and a schoolteacher mother who also played league, Burgess and his brothers brothers George, Tom and Luke were destined to play rugby.

- Attended Heckmondwike Grammer School, where he was given the nickname ‘moonhead’, and played junior rugby for Dewsbury Moor Amateur Rugby League Football Club.

- Made his debut for Bradford Bulls at 17 in 2006, and was named Senior Academy Player of the Year that season. His reputation in Bradford’s second row grew and he was rewarded with a call-up to the Great Britain squad for a series of matches against New Zealand, during the first of which he scored a try.

- Father and idol Mark — who played league at a semi-professional level with Nottingham City — died in 2007 after a short battle with motor neurone disease. Sam was his father’s primary carer during his illness, and would carry him up the 21 stairs in the family home to bed each night.

- In 2009, was contacted by Hollywood star Russell Crowe regarding the brothers moving to Crowe’s South Sydney Rabbitohs side. Became the first quartet of brothers to play in the Australian top flight since 1910. Sam, in particular, soon endeared himself to the Rabbitohs faithful, and took on legendary status after he played almost the entire 2014 NRL Grand Final with a broken cheekbone.

- Three of the brothers’ exploits for the Rabbitohs saw them named in the England squad for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, with eldest sibling Luke missing out. Sam finished the tournament with two tries as England were knocked out in the semi-final by New Zealand.

- Despite Rabbitohs chief executive Shane Richardsson’s proclamation that Burgess was ‘the greatest forward ever to have played our game’, the 25-year-old was seduced by the opportunity to try his hand at Rugby Union and earn a call-up to Stuart Lancaster’s side.
