Hate preacher Abu Qatada is to be given a new home at the taxpayers' expense, it emerged today.

The 52-year-old Jordanian that the Government has tried and failed to deport has asked to be rehoused.

His lawyers confirmed that his request has been granted. He and his family will continue to live on state benefits in their new home.

The announcement comes just two days after the Special Immigration Appeals Commission upheld his appeal against deportation.

He was released from prison on Tuesday on restrictive bail conditions - which include him being fitted with a GPS satellite tag to provide police and security officials with precise details of his movements.

Home Secretary Theresa May has said the Government will appeal against the decision to let him stay - which caused outrage across Britain.

Now, to add further anger, he and his family will shortly move from their current North London home to a secret address - all at public expense.

In a statement, Edward Fitzgerald QC said: 'The family are going to relocate and therefore Mr Qatada would accept the Home Office-approved accommodation.'

He refused to say whereabouts in the country Qatada will be living but he confirmed that the cleric and his family had asked to be relocated.

The surveillance operations to keep him under constant observation has been costing £5million a year and is set to continue indefinitely. The money pays for a team of 60 Scotland Yard officers, some MI5 officers and a private security firm.

Qatada moved to his current £400,000 address near Wembley, north west London, in February.

He returned there this week after his second period of time in prison. Housing benefit is understood to cover his current rent of £1,900 a month.

'It is outrageous that he and his family 
are living here at public expense when the rest of us have to go out and
work for a living.'

The family's desire to be moved follows noisy demonstrations that have been staged outside his house by protestors.

The demonstrators shouted 'Qatada out' and carried banners demanding his deportation when he arrived back on Tuesday.

Neighbours in Wembley were delighted to hear that the preacher is moving away.

One said: 'We are pleased he is leaving the street, although we would be even more happy if he was leaving the country altogether.

'It is outrageous that he and his family are living here at public expense when the rest of us have to go out and work for a living.'

A second neighbour said: 'I am glad that he is going. He is nothing but a burden on neighbours. I will be happy if he goes.'

Prime Minister David Cameron said this week that he was 'completely fed up that this man is still at large in our country'.

David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism laws, has warned it could be 'years' before the case is concluded.
