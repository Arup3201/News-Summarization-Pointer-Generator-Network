The veins in Gareth Bale’s legs jumped out when he walked on to the pitch at the Cardiff City Stadium and the muscles in his biceps rippled when he caught a stray ball from the boot of Toni Kroos.

This is Bale’s homecoming, back to the city where it all began for the Real Madrid star 25 years ago. The transformation is complete.

He is ripped, down to just six per cent body fat after spending the summer working on a conditioning programme that has produced some spectacular results.

‘It is a pure conditioning thing,’ he admitted as he prepares for Tuesday evening’s UEFA Super Cup final against Europa League winners Sevilla. ‘I worked hard in the off-season and I’m ready for a good year.

‘I haven’t done anything (special), just some off-season running, but nothing in the gym.’ Bale has worked hard, as the pictures of his phenomenal physique, published last week, showed. He could go head to head with his press-up obsessive team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo now.

Bale is a superstar, etching his name in the history of this incredible club after scoring in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon in May.

He was greeted by a few hundred well-wishers when he stepped off Real Madrid’s team bus on Monday night, revered in these parts after establishing himself as one of the best players in the world. 

‘Bale, Bale’ they shrieked as he emerged with his immaculate, slicked-back black hair — another noticeable difference from the moody teenager look he once had at Tottenham.

‘Gareth, leave your barnet (hair) alone,’ was Harry Redknapp’s assessment of the Wales flyer when he first worked with him at White Hart Lane. There are no issues with it now.

‘It is great to be back home, but that’s not the important thing,’ he added. ‘This is a title we want to win.’ 

He is a humble boy, a hard worker after listening to the advice of his mum Debbie and dad Frank when he was growing up in Whitchurch, just three miles away from Cardiff’s new stadium.

They will be in the stands, watching their boy run out with the most expensively assembled team in the history of European club football. 

Real’s dressing room is bulging with big names and two more — Colombia’s James Rodriguez and Germany’s World Cup winner Kroos — arrived this summer. That pair and Bale will start for Real against Sevilla.

Bale’s position in this team feels secure, with 22 goals in his debut season justifying the decision to spend a world-record £85million to sign him from Tottenham.

‘It is nice not being the new boy,’ he added. ‘I am settled, I have had a good pre-season; it was easier than the last one. I was sat at home last year waiting, but this time I’m in better shape and don’t feel any pressure.’

On Tuesday night, when he runs out in front of 20,000 supporters, he will be King of Cardiff. One day, Bale could rule the world. In October the nominations for the FIFA Ballon d’Or award will be announced and Bale is expected to be on the shortlist.

His coach Carlo Ancelotti believes the forward has already established himself as one of the top stars. ‘As I said a lot of the time last year, Gareth is the best,’ admitted the Italian coach.

‘I’m not so interested in personal awards and what is important is that Gareth is here to help win titles. If I say Gareth deserves to win, then I could say the same about Sergio Ramos or Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is one of the best.’

He is a dedicated pro, a student of the game after his explosive speed and his match-winning abilities were first harnessed at Whitchurch High School a decade ago.

Now it is all about La Decima, the 10th European Cup that he helped secure and the pressures that being a Real Madrid player bring with it. Only the very best survive. 

Goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who has been at the Bernabeu throughout his career, claimed Bale had the constitution to become one of the Real Madrid greats.

‘You need to be able to live with the pressure of being a Real Madrid player because you are always exposed to criticism, but Gareth has shown he can do that,’ he admitted.

‘Even if you have won the Champions League they demand even more from you. With the history of the club, if you have a season without a title it is a failure.

‘At Real Madrid we have an obligation to go to the Plaza de Cibeles every year to celebrate everything we have achieved.’

On Tuesday evening they will come to salute one of their own, bulging muscles and all.
