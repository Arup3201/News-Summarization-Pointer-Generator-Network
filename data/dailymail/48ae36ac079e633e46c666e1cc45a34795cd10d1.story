Pro-Russian rebels have shot down a helicopter from the skies above Slaviansk in eastern Ukraine with nine people thought to have been killed in the single burst of violence.

The Ukrainian helicopter was carrying military cargo when it was brought down by the rebel fire.

Only days ago did new Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko initiate his ceasefire for the region in an attempt to quell the violence which has been plaguing the region for months.

 Vladyslav Seleznyov confirmed the helictoper had been shot down, 
stating: 'There was a three-man crew, in all, nine people (on board).'

The violence comes just as Russian president Vladimir
 Putin staged an extraordinary retreat in seeking the withdrawal of a 
resolution by the Russian parliament allowing him to send Russian troops
 into Ukraine.

His climbdown appeared to be a victory for the West's threat of brutal new sanctions unless he backed peace moves in Ukraine.

Russian
 senators granted Mr Putin the right to send the army into Ukraine on March 1, but yesterday he called for the removal of this threat against 
his neighbouring state.

While the West remained wary, the Kremlin claimed Putin was committed to 'normalising the atmosphere and resolving the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine'.

However, the Russian strongman is adamant that the Ukrainian government must hold direct talks with separatist leaders which Kiev has labelled 'terrorists'.

And he retains 65,000 troops on active combat alert in central Russia.

Mr Poroshenko dubbed Mr Putin's surprise move his 'first practical step' in support of the peace plan to end the worst east-west conflict since the end of the Cold War in which at least 375 have perished.

Until now, the West saw Mr Putin as pouring fuel on crisis in a bid to destabilise Ukraine because its new government was looking towards Europe rather than Russia.

There were genuine fears he could invade eastern Ukraine.

The US and EU had threatened Mr Putin with sanctions that would damage entire sectors of his already ailing economy unless he showed his backing for the peace plan.

Until now, Moscow has scoffed at the penalties imposed by the West over the March annexation of Crimea.

But yesterday the Russian financial markets surged and the rouble rose to its highest level since mid-January.

Mr Putin acted after initial talks between Poroshenko's envoy, ex-president Leonid Kuchma, and separatist leaders.

Despite this, a ceasefire agreed to by the rebels runs out on Friday, and many separatists remain opposed to any deal as evidenced by an attack on Kuchma's car in Donetsk.

Mr Putin yesterday kept his forces on combat alert drilling in 'peacekeeping duties'.

The West has feared such a pretext could be used by the Russian leader to send his forces into Ukraine.

After a phone call between Barack Obama and Mr Putin, the White House stressed that Russian 'will face additional costs if we do not see concrete actions to de-escalate the situation'.

The drill involves 180 warplanes, 60 helicopters, and 5,500 weapons.

A Royal Navy warship intercepted a Russian military vessel that strayed close to Nato-protected waters in the Baltics in an echo of the Cold War.

HMS Montrose, a Type 23 frigate, was taking part in a multinational exercise off the Danish coast when she was dispatched to investigate an unidentified surface ship picked up on radar.

Despite choppy seas and 30 knot winds, the crew identified the unknown ship as the 104 metre-long Steregushchiy-class frigate RFS Soobrazitelny skirting Danish waters as it sailed west in the Baltic Sea.

As HMS Montrose closed with the Russian vessel, a Russian Ilyushin IL-20 ‘Coot’ maritime patrol aircraft was detected and appeared overhead, circling the two ships.

It was one of the Royal Navy's most significant encounters with Russian warships in the region since the Ukraine crisis began.

Navy chiefs said the show of strength demonstrated Nato’s resolve to protect its 28-members against any threat from the kremlin.

Both the Russian vessel and aircraft appeared to be carrying out routine manoeuvres in international waters.

Commander James Parkin, commanding officer of HMS Montrose, said: ‘All our interaction so far has been professional, and effective, and we have gained huge benefit from working so closely with our allies in such a busy and challenging environment.’

Lieutenant Chloe Lea, HMS Montrose’s watch officer, said: ‘We picked up a vessel on our radar that was not showing any of the normal behaviour expected of merchant vessels or allied warships. We have seen the Russians operate a lot in this area but this is the closest we have seen them.’

Plymouth-based HMS Montrose, which has 205 crew and is armed with Sting Ray torpedoes, Sea Wolf missiles and Harpoon missiles, is taking part in the US-led exercise involving warships, submarines and helicopters from 14 different nations.

Last week two RAF fighters shadowed seven menacing Russian warplanes that flew too close to Baltic airspace.

The fully-armed Typhoons from 3 (Fighter) Squadron were scrambled after unidentified aircraft were detected by Nato air defences in international airspace. All were subsequently identified as Russian.

Four Typhoons were deployed to the region in April under orders to respond forcefully to any violation of the airspace of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania which do not have their own air defence fighters and rely upon Nato.
