Police have seized and searched the taxi that Jesse Matthew, the prime suspect in the kidnapping of UVA student Hannah Graham, was driving the night Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington vanished in 2009, it was revealed today.

According to a source with knowledge of the investigation, Matthew was driving the cab in 2009 on the night 20-year-old Harrington went missing after a concert in Charlottesville.

According to CNN, police have seized the taxi that Matthew was driving that night from a farm after DNA evidence that was found last month linked the 32-year-old to Harrington's death.

Matthew was arrested last month and charged with abduction with intent to defile in the Graham case after leading police on a manhunt that ended in Texas. He is currently behind bars.

Graham, 18, a sophomore at UVA, was last seen on a surveillance video walking with Matthew on the Charlottesville downtown mall on the morning of September 13. She hasn’t been seen or heard from since.

The 32-year-old nursing assistant also has been linked by DNA evidence to the disappearance of 20-year-old Morgan Harrington five years earlier.

The young woman went missing October 17, 2009, after attending a Metallica concert at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville.

The Virginia Tech student's corpse was discovered on a farm in Albemarie three months later.

'This is what we hoped for, that more pieces of the puzzle would come together,' said Dan Harrington, the victim's father, to the New York Daily News.

'It's exciting, it's encouraging to hear but it's still sad for us too. It will hopefully open up more doors for us.'

Speaking to federal and state officials, Matthew’s former co-workers recalled that on the night of Harrignton’s disappearance, the suspect was working as a cab driver.

Charlottesville taxi driver Melvin Carter Jr also told NBC29 that he had been told by a police detective that Ms Harrington got into a cab after the fateful rock concert.

‘[They] said yes, she did jump into a taxi cab her last time being seen alive,’ said Carter, Jr.

‘He could have made an impression on her because what I heard from her mental state, she was upset, so she may have found someone who was loving and trusting and comforted her,’ Carter speculated.

Following the 20-year-old’s disappearance, Matthew was interviewed by police along with dozens of cab drivers who were behind that wheel the night of October 17, 2009.

Premonition: Matthew's fellow cabbies recalled how at times he would get upset when they would jokingly compare him to a sketch of Harrington's killer and a suspect in a 2005 rape

Two weeks ago, police working on the Harrington and Graham cases recovered Matthew's old cab from a Virginia farm.

Meanwhile, federal and state investigators have interviewed about 20 taxi drivers in Charlottesville asking about Morgan Harrington and Matthew's demeanor.

Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, released a statement Thursday saying their family have been hoping that more pieces of the puzzle would come together.

‘It's exciting, it's encouraging to hear but it's still sad for us too,’ the statement read. ‘It will hopefully open up more doors for us.’

People who knew Matthew in 2009 told CBS6 how they would joke with him that he resembled a sketch connected to a 2005 rape case in Fairfax and the Harrington case.

Matthew at times would ignore their jabs, but every once in a while he would appear shaken and take off on his own for hours.

The FBI indicated that based on forensic evidence, Harrington’s killer also raped a woman in Northern Virginia in 2005
