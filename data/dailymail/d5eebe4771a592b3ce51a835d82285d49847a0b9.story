His loved ones wanted to remember him as an innocent family man.

But there was no escaping the murky past of Mark Duggan – the suspected gangster whose death sparked nationwide riots after he was shot by police – as mourners packed a church for his funeral yesterday.

In tributes made by relatives before the 1,000-strong congregation he was described as a man who turned his life around with the help of his beloved partner; who loved playing computer games with their three children; who enjoyed getting ‘dressed up to the nines in bling’ to go out partying.

Procession: People paid tribute to the man described as a 'fallen soldier'

The funeral was held this afternoon for Mark Duggan who was shot dead by police last month. It was his death which sparked riots across England

He was a ‘big kid himself’, said a 
cousin. What’s more, she claimed, he was a ‘peacemaker’ who resolved 
conflicts in the community. And he had recently applied to become a 
fireman.

But another side to Mark Duggan’s 
life was evident too. It was there in the one-armed salute that men and 
women gave as the white, horse-drawn hearse passed along the streets 
from Duggan’s family home in Tottenham.

And it was there outside New 
Testament Church of God in Wood Green, North London, where the service 
was held, as friends spoke on the street of Duggan as ‘one of our fallen
 soldiers’.

Outside the church, where those 
mourners who could not fit inside stood on the pavement, the air was 
thick with the smell of cannabis. Dark glasses were the order of the day
 for men, short skirts for women.

For Duggan, 29, was also known as 
‘Starrish Mark’. He was an ‘elder’, or senior member, of The Star Gang, 
who strut the streets of Tottenham where such gangs trade in violence, 
intimidation and drugs.

Yesterday, among the floral tributes spelling out ‘dad’ and ‘son’, there was also a star-shaped wreath. 
  During the 90-minute service Duggan’s 
cousin Donna Martin began an obituary by repeating his nickname 
‘Starrish’ three times, eliciting applause from the congregation.

She told of his upbringing on the 
notorious Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham and how he left aged 13 to
 live in Manchester with an aunt. There was no mention of the fact that 
Duggan was the nephew of notorious crime boss the late Desmond ‘Dessie’ 
Noonan who boasted his gang had ‘more guns than the police’ and whose 
feared family are ‘major players’ in Manchester’s underworld.

But she did tell how Duggan had lost 
friends in Manchester in ‘unfortunate circumstances’ and how, after he 
moved back to London, he treated his friend Kelvin ‘Smegz’ Easton ‘like a
 little brother’.

Easton, 23, another gang member, was 
stabbed through the heart with a broken champagne bottle at a nightclub 
in East London last March in a row over drugs and a woman. Duggan is 
said to have carried a gun afterwards for his own protection.

Another source has said he was 
planning to avenge the death, which is believed to be one of the reasons
 that officers from Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime 
within London’s black community, had Duggan under surveillance and were 
trailing him in unmarked cars.

He was a passenger in a minicab which
 was apparently stopped by police near Tottenham Hale Tube station on 
the night of August 4 when he was shot.

The Independent Police Complaints 
Commission, which is investigating the shooting, said police fired two 
shots. One killed Duggan, the other lodged in the radio of another 
police officer. Duggan’s gun, originally thought to have been a 
converted replica, had not been fired.

Two days after Duggan died, the 
Tottenham riots erupted after his family spent five frustrating hours 
seeking a meeting and explanation from local police chiefs. The 
circumstances of Duggan’s death have led to lingering tensions between 
family members and detectives. Yesterday policing at the funeral was 
low-key. But at least a dozen police riot vans and their officers were 
spotted on stand-by nearby.

Loss: Wearing a T-shirt with a picture of his father and the words 'Miss you Daddy', Duggan's 10-year-old son arrives at church

Back at the church, ten black 
Mercedes limos brought Duggan’s loved ones to the church. One of his 
three children arrived in a white-striped suit and a T-shirt emblazoned 
with the words ‘Miss You Daddy’ and a picture of his father in 
sunglasses.

In an echo of the image, the little 
boy was wearing oversized sunglasses. Along with his baby sister, he was
 comforted by his mother, Mr Duggan’s girlfriend Semone Wilson, as they 
watched the horse-drawn hearse pass.

During Miss Martin’s obituary, we 
also learned that Duggan’s favourite films included gangster movie 
Scarface and – ‘secretly’, she said – Annie. She repeated the family’s 
belief that he would not have pointed a gun at police by saying he was 
‘no idiot and not suicidal’. Duggan’s partner Miss Wilson, 29, paid 
tribute to him as her ‘first real love’ in a message read out by her 
sister Michelle Palmer-Scott.

‘We faced trials and tribulations 
together. We had our ups and we had our downs but through it all, I 
loved him,’ she said, adding: ‘I don’t understand why you’re gone so 
soon.’

Duggan’s mother Pamela Duggan, 53, 
said: ‘In many way Semone saved Mark and that’s why he loved her dearly.
 She loved him unconditionally like they loved their children.’

Pastor Nims Obunge made an impassioned plea for peace in the community, which he said has seen ‘too much blood’.

Event: Around 750 people packed into the church for the service with many more waiting outside

Gathering: During the funeral, police parked in Alexandra Palace
waiting to be called for duty

Police were close to Tottenham and Wood Green in what appears to be a precaution should any violence flare after the service

‘Let mothers not have to come and 
bury their children. Let fathers not have to come and weep for their 
children the way we weep today,’ he said, to whoops and applause. ‘We 
have been hurt, we have been scarred, we have been maligned, we have 
been stigmatised, we have been called names. Today we stand as one community but we say, “Not any more – it shall stop”.’

Asked about the police’s version of 
Duggan’s death so far, Ken Hinds, a friend who was a steward at the 
funeral and is chairman of the Stop and Search Monitoring Group for 
Haringey, said: ‘It doesn’t fit in with everything that’s known on the 
street.

‘It’s caused significant damage. It 
has further fuelled the tension in the community and contributed to the 
uprising that we experienced.’

Duggan was buried at Wood Green Cemetery before a reception at Broadwater Farm Community Centre.

Mark Duggan

An earlier version of this  article suggested that mourners lining the streets as Mark Duggan’s body was carried to his funeral made “gang-style” salutes. We have been informed that the salute pictured above referred to a call by Bishop Kwaku Frimpong-Manson at an earlier service for mourners to “stretch [their] hands towards the casket and thank God for Mark’s life as he begins his heavenly journey”.  We are happy to clarify this and regret any confusion or distress caused.
