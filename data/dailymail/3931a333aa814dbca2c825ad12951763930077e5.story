Cheslin is seen leaving court following the surprise verdict

A bogus model agent who urged a 12-year-old to pose for pictures in her underwear has avoided a jail sentence despite being branded a danger to young girls.

Nathan Cheslin called himself 'Emily' to reel in the schoolgirl with a discussion about becoming a model through the MSN online message service.

He later reverted to the name 'Nathan' and checked she had a webcam before asking her to put on a 'party dress' and high heels.

Birmingham Crown Court heard Cheslin then sent her pictures of another girl in her underwear as an indication of how he wanted her to pose.

The 21-year-old, of Lindridge Drive, Sutton Coldfield, had previously admitted inciting a child to participate in child pornography, seven charges of making indecent photos and six of distributing them.

Judge William Davis QC said he constituted a danger to teenage girls.

But he handed Cheslin a three-year community order, saying he believed that was the best way of addressing his problems and protecting the public.

Paul Dhami, prosecuting, said the police were called after the 12-year-old told Cheslin she felt uncomfortable with the underwear request.

He begged her not to alert the 
authorities and, a short time later, contacted the girl as 'Emily' 
saying 'Nathan' had been sacked.

A police investigation later revealed both user names were registered to Cheslin's home address.

His home was raided and officers recovered a number of items including a laptop which held evidence of several webchats, along with indecent pictures and films of children - one of a 13-year-old girl carrying out an indecent act over a webcam.

Mr Dhami said it was also discovered that some photos and films had been uploaded to a site that could be shared by others.

Phillip Brunt, defending, said Cheslin had a difficult educational history and had recently been diagnosed with Aspergers.
