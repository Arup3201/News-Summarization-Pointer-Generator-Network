Between $3million and $5million of Canadian coins spilled onto a highway in Ontario after a Brinks tractor-trailer carrying new coins struck a rock formation.

The accident happened earlier this week when the truck crossed the centre line and hit the jutting rock, causing currency to fly across the highway.

Another tractor-trailer with candy as its cargo got into the crash, adding candy to the piles of loonies and toonies on the highway.

Frozen assets: Millions of loonies and toonies came to rest in the slush and snow of the Ontario highway

Up north: The accident occurred near Kirkland, Ontario, which is close to the Quebec border

The initial crash happened around 4am Wednesday morning on a snowy, isolated stretch of Highway 11 near Kirkland Lake, Ontario.

The Brinks tractor-trailer crashed into a rock formation, which cut gashes all along the side of the vehicle.

Millions of dollars of loonies and toonies fell out of their plastic casings and onto the highway.

Two other vehicles – including the truck full of candy – were involved in the accident. According to CTV, both drivers were treated for minor injuries.

Critical condition: Both the driver and the passenger of the Brinks truck were taken to nearby hospitals with 'life-threatening' injuries

Cleanup: Crews used heavy machinery and an industrial-strength magnet to collect the coins

The driver and passenger of the Brinks truck were not so fortunate – both sustained life-threatening injuries, according to CTV, and were being treated at nearby hospitals.

Authorities said they are working quickly to clean up the ‘vehicular carnage,’ adding that an accident involving this much currency is rare.

‘It is rather unique in the fact that such a sizable amount of Canadian currency is strewn about a collision,’ South Porcupine community services officer Const. Marc Depatie to CTV News. 

He said that passers-by have not been tempted to help themselves to a few extra dollars. ‘We are going to be using magnets and other less sophisticated means of collecting the cargo.’

Vehicular carnage: Cardboard boxes, metal, and coins litter the highway

He told cbc.ca that the rock ‘acted as a can opener,’ effectively peeled the side of the truck back, allowing coins to catapult onto the highway.

A police constable at the clean-up Wednesday said like he was walking ‘on a carpet of loonies and toonies.’

According to the Ontario Provincial Police, the coins will be sent to a secure location once they are all collected. 

The coins were freshly minted and were due to be circulated.
