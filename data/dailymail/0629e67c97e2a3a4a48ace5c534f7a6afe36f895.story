The two most important men in Lewis Hamilton’s life left Singapore, one with a permanent smile, the other with a frown and a suitcase full of trouble.

The first was Anthony Hamilton, Lewis’s father and backbone through his karting life. The second was Paddy Lowe, the Mercedes boffin trying to stop millions of pounds’ worth of technology from breaking.

Whether a car that can last a race or a mind in top working order is more crucial to Hamilton is unclear.

Either way, Hamilton Snr’s presence at the last two Grands Prix has coincided with his son winning both. Tellingly, Lewis has never won a championship without his father as his other, equally significant half.

Hamilton moved in 2010 from his father’s management to XIX Entertainment. But his dad remains a part of Lewis’s racing soul.

The nature of their relationship has changed, however. ‘Now it’s that time I told you about years ago after my dad was manager — I said I can’t wait for the day when he’s here just as my dad,’ said Hamilton. ‘And that’s what you’re seeing. That’s one of the greatest feelings, having him here.’

Yes, Hamilton’s father could rub Lewis up the wrong way but he provided competitive traction, the absence of which is arguably a major factor in Lewis’s fluctuating form and mood in the years since they parted full-time company.

After beating Nico Rosberg, who gave up his 22-point championship lead, Hamilton welcomed the idea of other family members joining him for the final five races. Mother Carmen and girlfriend Nicole could join Anthony and stepmother Linda in the travelling support.

He added: ‘I have quite a big family. I’ve got my mum and my step-dad. And then I’ve got my missus, who’s wanted to come all year. All my family are a real positive beam of light for me at the weekend. You know the difficulties I’ve had: my family being there the whole way and then a period when they’re not there.’

In Singapore it was Rosberg who suffered the technical bug. Which of the pair has more luck between now and the end of the season could well decide the title.
