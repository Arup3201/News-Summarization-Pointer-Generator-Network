Hubbard said the charges - which come just weeks before the November vote in which he is favored for re-election - constitute 'a political witch hunt'

Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard has been arrested on 'ethics' charges, with accusations that he has been using public office for his own personal gain.

He was indicted by a grand jury on 23 charges accusing him of misusing his speaker's office and his previous post as chairman of the Alabama Republican Party.

If convicted, the Speaker faces from two to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $300,000 on each count.

Hubbard, 52, said the charges - which come just weeks before the November vote in which he is favored for re-election - constitute 'a political witch hunt'.

The speaker, who represents the 79th district in Lee County, insisted that his party had made big changes in 'cleaning up the way things are done in Montgomery'.

He said: 'The fact is we have been very successful at getting big things done in Lee County including 3000 new jobs over he past four years.' 

'I'm sleeping well at night because I know the people of Lee County can see this for what it is and that's  Hubbard added.

The Republican led the GOP's takeover of the Legislature in 2010, ending 136 years of Democratic control. He became the first Republican house speaker since Reconstruction.

House Minority Leader Craig Ford argued that it is 'obvious' that the charges are not politically motivated 'because it is a Republican Attorney General leading the investigation'.

'You never like to hear about things like this,' he said in a statement. 'You never want to see anything like this happen to anyone. It shakes the peoples' faith in their elected leaders. 

'It is sad to see that, in less than four years, our leaders have embraced the culture of corruption that they ran against in 2010.'

The charges brought against Hubbard include 11 counts of soliciting or receiving a thing of value from a lobbyist or principal, four counts of lobbying an executive department or agency for a fee and four counts of using of his office as chairman of the Alabama Republican Party for personal gain.

He also faces two counts of using his office as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives for personal gain, one count of voting for legislation with a conflict of interest and a single count of using state equipment, materials, etc. for private gain.

According to Fox 6, in a statement, Hubbard's attorney, J. Mark White vowed to fight the charges leveled against his client, insisting Hubbard 'expressly and emphatically denies any wrongdoing'.

Describing the authorities who brought the charges as 'rogue prosecutors', he states: Mike Hubbard and his family have been intentionally subjected to a political persecution led by individuals whose defined agenda does not include seeking either justice or truth.'

He adds: 'Mike has used his office appropriately, and he has worked to advance the cause of ethics reform in this state; in fact, ethics reforms which had been sought for decades were passed almost immediately after Mike's colleagues selected him as their leader.

'We look forward to bringing the great wrongs committed against Mike Hubbard and violations of his constitutionally-assured rights out of the secrecy and shadows and into the light of day.'

The charges are the latest corruption allegations against Alabama politicians to come to light.

In early April, Greg Wren resigned his position in the Alabama House of Representatives and pleaded guilty to using his office for personal gain.
