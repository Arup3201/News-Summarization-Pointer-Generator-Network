Tragic: Alex Wyithe a 29-year-old graduate of Brighton University, lived in Crawley, West Sussex and died on Sunday March 16 after attending the bash in Thailand and going swimming

A British man has died after getting caught in a rip-tide at an all night beach party on
the island of Ko Phangan in Thailand.

Alex
Wyithe, 29, was on a holiday of a lifetime on the sun-kissed island of Ko Phangan, where full moon
parties are popular among travellers.

It
is a well known venue for drink and drugs hedonism and DJs who play all night to crowds
of around 30,000 at the monthly parties at Haad Rin Beach.

Alex,
29, a graduate of Brighton University, lived in Crawley, West Sussex, and died
on March 16 after attended the bash and going swimming.

He had gone to Thailand on a two week holiday to have a hair transplant.

The 29-year-old, who was a property developer, flew out to Thailand on March 3 to have an operation to cover up his receding hairline.

Writing online after the operation on March 7 he said the op had lasted eight hours and cost him more than £2,000.

He said he decided to have the procedure after his friends kept kidding him that he was going bald, joking that after the procedure he would look like Wayne Rooney's better looking poorer brother.

He wrote on March 7: 'Hair transplant! Got 20 stitches in back of my head - 2,400 hairs moved to front. Week til stitches come out n scabs go!

'The hair falls out n root grows over next 4-8 months.'

In one of his last postings on Facebook, written on February 27 just before he jetted off to Thailand, Alex wrote about how excited he was.

He said: 'In 4 days I will be flying club, shaving my head, wearing a bandana, feeding crocodiles chicken at Asia's largest crocodile farm, going to a full moon party.

'Getting a massage every other day, and hopefully I will see a whale shark and get to snorkel with it.

'Its the best time of year to see them and I suppose I may have to try a Samsung bucket or two.'

Samsung buckets are huge cocktails made from Sang Som rum, which is distilled from sugarcane, mixed with Red Bull and cola.

Wyithe had died while on holiday in Thailand, he was out at the full moon party

‘I
don't know all the details but he was swimming and got caught in a rip tide, he
was pulled form the water but was unable to be revived.

‘We
are all feeling devastated and shocked of this tragic loss, It is obvious from
the amount of tributes there are a lot of people out there who are too.’

passing away tragically in an accident whilst on holiday in Thailand.

‘Alex
was a good man. I know he was excited about being in Thailand.

can I say about Alex. He was a generous man with a gentle heart. He often made
me laugh and he made me see reason when I couldn't see it. 

‘Rest
in Peace Alex. You are in my heart, thoughts and prayers. All my love to you
and your family.’

Friend
Matt Benham, who only met Alex last week, said: ‘I only met Alex in Bangkok
last week. I wish I had known him far earlier in my life as we clicked straight
away and is without doubt the perfect person for me to get on with!

‘He
was uber happy to be here and getting done what he needed to get done then
enjoy the rest of his trip. I really wanted to hook up here with him again,
before we became mates back in the UK.

‘I,
like everyone am truly devastated hearing he has gone.

‘It's
a testament to his personality that after meeting someone twice he has had this
effect on me as I can't think of anyone else that I have met that would have
done so.

‘He
did me such a small favour to him but it had a massive effect on me, and wanted
to repay him. So kind!’

A
spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that the
Government is aware of a death on March 16 and is supporting the family.

Video Full moon party in Koh Phangan

Haad Rin beach on Koh Phangan island, off the east coast of Thailand, was once a tranquil hippy secret.

Over
 the last three decades, however, it has gained growing fame for its 
Full Moon parties – which can now take place pretty much any time – with
 blaring Western dance music.

The
 hedonistic atmosphere of Haad Rin beach is thought to have inspired the
 hit film The Beach, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tilda Swinton, and 
the original book of the same name by British author Alex Garland.
