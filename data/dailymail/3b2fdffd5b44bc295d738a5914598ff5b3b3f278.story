Tragic: Lucas Drummond, 16, from Hackney, north London, has plummeted to his death while leading a rock climbing expedition in Costa Rica

The parents of a 16-year-old British schoolboy who plummeted to his death while leading a rock climbing expedition in Costa Rica have paid tribute to their 'adventurous' and 'loving' son.

Lucas Drummond, from Hackney, north London, is believed to have fallen as he abseiled down a rock face in Santa Ana, a suburb of the capital San Jose.

He had travelled to Central America to complete his sixth form studies as part of an 
International Baccalaureate programme.

The teenager's parents Carol and John, a property developer and former Hackney councillor, flew to Costa Rica after learning of the tragedy last Friday.

In a statement today, they said: 'We are devastated by the loss of our son Lucas, who was a devoted and loving brother and son to us and friend to so many.

'Lucas was always full of life and energy, someone with so many ideas of how to change the world for the better, and that is how we will remember him.

'He was given the opportunity to study abroad in a multi-cultural international school with an ethos of being able to help others while learning about themselves.

'This was like a dream come true for Lucas and an opportunity to help develop his lively mind and his spirit for adventure which was a strong part of his being. He died doing what he loved.'

It is not known when the couple will fly home, and the curtains remain drawn at their Victorian terrace home near Victoria Park.

Lucas, a former pupil of Stoke Newington School, is understood to have been an experienced climber who had taken part in competitions around Britain.

He had been leading four 
other students from the United World College of Costa Rica (UWC) under the 
supervision of a local instructor when he fell, according to reports.

He is believed to have been out 
of sight of the rest of the party as he led the descent on the mountain range, before plummeting to his death. 

In the statement, Lucas's parents thanked UWC for their support, adding: 'We 
ask that our privacy be respected as we grieve for Lucas.'

Today, tributes were being paid to the teenager, who is said to have been 'talented in many areas'.

Lucas's former headteacher, Annie Gammon, said: 'Everyone at Stoke Newington School is shocked and saddened by this tragic news.

'Lucas was a popular member of our school for the five years he was with us - many of our students stayed in touch with him once he had left and started sixth form in Costa Rica.

'He was very talented in many areas and we remember his drama performances particularly well.

'Staff and students have signed a book of condolences at the school, and our thoughts go out to his family at this terrible time.'

Meanwhile, Mauricio Viales, Principal of UWC Costa 
Rica, said: 'We are all very saddened by the loss of our student, Lucas.

'He was an outstanding young man, full of energy and creative ideas, 
always looking to serve others and dedicated to the ideals of diversity 
as it applies to the larger world of history, politics, and economics.

'Our entire community including Lucas's fellow classmates, his teachers, 
and our support and administrative staff deeply feel his passing.'

Dominic O'Reilly, director of communications at UWC International, added: 'The staff and students of UWC Costa Rica 
united in activities and vigils, including a tree planting, to express 
their grief and remember a hugely popular and valued member of their 
community.'

'UWC Costa Rica is cooperating fully with the local authorities’ investigation'.

Neighbours have also paid tribute to the schoolboy, saying the community had been left 'heartbroken' by his death.

Mother-of-two Paula Milhazes, 39, said: 'He was a really nice boy. His death has come as such a shock to everybody.

'No-one
 ever had a bad word to say about Lucas. He was a really, really nice 
boy and really brave to go abroad to go to school. He was really 
bright.'

She said Lucas had chosen to complete 
his sixth form studies in Costa Rica himself, even though his parents 
had some concerns about him living so far away.

'They
 weren't happy for him to go,' she said. 'They were scared because he 
was going so far. But he wanted to go and do it and they couldn't stand 
in his way.

'They were a very close family. His parents must be heartbroken.'

She added: 'He was always quite adventurous. I know that since he was a boy he liked to go climbing. Everyone is really heartbroken for the family.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'We are all very upset. It is tragic.'

Police are investigating Lucas's death, and have examined his ropes and climbing equipment so far.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office refused to comment on the circumstances of the teenager's death.

But he said: 'We are aware of an incident involving a British national and we are providing consular support.'
