Thousands of firefighters from across Massachusetts and beyond have joined family and friends in paying final respects to a 43-year-old Boston firefighter killed in a nine-alarm blaze last week.

Lt. Edward Walsh died alongside 33-year-old colleague Michael Kennedy when they became trapped by the fire at a Back Bay brownstone one week ago.

Walsh was married with three children all under the age of 10 who were all in attendance at his funeral today.

The funeral came the day after firefighters spent hours searching through the rubble for 'Eddie's' wedding ring, which was missing from his hand when his body was found.

'Eddie never took his wedding ring off,' firefighter Richie Paris told the Boston Globe.

Walsh's
 wife Kristen called the firehouse asking if they had found the ring 
during the ensuing investigation after the fire, his friends realized 
that it was still missing and headed out to the site for hours on 
Tuesday to find it.

The
 Globe reported that the group found the ring just before dusk and 
rushed to the church where his wake was being held to get it back to 
Kristen. She put it on her finger- even though it was much too big for 
her- while seated next to her husband's coffin.

On Wednesday, it was a sea of blue uniforms along the 
streets outside of St Patrick's Church in suburban Watertown in support 
of their fellow emergency responder.

Walsh will be buried next to his father, a former Watertown firefighter. His late uncle also served as a fireman in Watertown and his cousin is currently their captain. 

The Mass was attended by Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley and Irish tenor Ronan Tynan sang.

Kennedy's wake is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. His funeral is Thursday in Boston's West Roxbury neighborhood.

Overflowing: The service was held at the Church of St Patrick in Watertown but there were far too many attendees to fit inside

The two firefighters were killed by a 
fast-moving, wind-driven nine-alarm fire that ripped through a Boston 
brownstone after they were trapped in the basement.

‘We lost two heroes today,’ Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said at an evening press conference following the blaze.

Walsh
 and Kennedy went inside the building and then descended into the 
basement, where it appears the fire originated. They called a mayday two
 or three minutes after entering but couldn't be rescued.

Lt Walsh had spent nearly a decade fighting fires as part of Engine Company 33.

Blending the masses: In addition to the bagpipers, the Mass was attended by Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley and Irish tenor Ronan Tynan sang

Hometown: Walsh was based out of Watertown, a Boston suburb, like his firefighter father and uncle were before him. His cousin is now the captain of the Watertown firehouse

Scene: The Thursday, March 27 blaze in Boston was one of the city's deadliest in recent years
