Diane Keaton has finally revealed why she fell for Woody Allen.

It wasn't just the bespectacled director's legendary humour that first attracted the Oscar-winning actress, but his 'great body'.

While Allen has never been known for his athletic prowess, Keaton, 65, describes him in her upcoming memoir as 'physically very graceful'.

'Great body': Diane Keaton, pictured with then-lover Woody Allen on the set of 1977's Annie Hall, has revealed that it was his physical build that attracted her

She writes in Then Again: 'It was his manner that got me, 
his way of gesturing, his hands, his coughing and looking down in a 
self-deprecating way while he told jokes.

'He was even better-looking in real life. He had a great body, and he was physically very graceful.'

The couple met in 1968 while working together on Allen's stage comedy Play It Again, 
Sam - roles they re-enacted for the 1972 film version.

They were together for a decade before splitting up in the late 1970s after building a body of work including the classics Sleeper, Love And Death, Annie Hall and Manhattan.

Keaton said that she began to fall in love with Allen, now 75, during rehearsals for Play It Again, Sam when she realised that his real-life persona was the same as the divorced neurotic he was playing.

She writes: 'How could I not? I was in love with 
him before I knew him.

'He was Woody Allen. Our entire family used to 
gather around the TV set and watch him on Johnny Carson. He was so hip, 
with his thick glasses and cool suits.'

Unsurprisingly, she reveals that it was her neurotic tendencies that attracted Allen to her.

She writes: 'Woody got used to me. He couldn't help himself; he loved neurotic girls.

'We shared a love of torturing each 
other with our failures. His insights into my character were dead-on and
hilarious. This bond remains the core of our friendship and, for me, 
love.'

She even describes herself as 'his endearing oaf [while] I had him pegged as a cross between a White Thing and the cockroach you couldn't kill.'

And, like scenes out of Annie Hall, 
Manhattan and so many other Allen comedies, the couple watched art-house
films such as Ingmar Bergman's Persona, checked out German 
Expressionist art on Madison Avenue and visited a Diane Arbus exhibit at
the Museum of Modern Art.

Autobiography: Then Again is published next month by Random House

In what for Allen must have been a sign of true love, he even recommended an analyst.

Much of Keaton's book centres on her close relationship with her mother, Dorothy Hall, and Then Again includes excerpts from family journals and letters.

In one journal entry, Keaton's mother remembers seeing a screening in 1977 of Annie Hall, which was based in part on Allen's relationship with Keaton, whose birth name is Diane Hall.

'Annie's camera in hand, her gum chewing, her lack of confidence; pure Diane. The story was tender, funny, and sad. It ended in separation, just like real life,' writes Dorothy Hall, who died in 2008.

Keaton's previous boyfriends have included Al Pacino and Warren Beatty.

Then Again is published next month and is excerpted in the November issue of Vogue.
