A daredevil adventurer has flown around Mount Fuji while wearing a custom-built jet suit.

Switzerland-based Yves Rossy, dubbed the 'jetman' completed the flight around the Japanese mountain wearing the complicated four engined carbon-Kevlar 'Jetwing'.

The 54-year-old did nine flights around the iconic landmark between October 28 and November 3 to celebrate Mount Fuji's designation as a world heritage site.

Mr Rossy's jet suit allows him to race through the sky at 190mph and he uses a throttle in his hand to control his speed, the Telegraph reports.

He can climb as high as 12,000ft (3,657m) and travel as far as 9.3 miles (15km).

The stuntman has performed death-defying flights over the English Channel, the Swiss Alps as well as the Grand Canyon.

But Mount Fuji has a special place in his heart and he said it was 'beautiful in its presence and its form'.

Mr Rossy strapped on the jetwing and dropped from a helicopter before deploying the jet-powered carbon-kevlar 'Jetwing' and used his body to steer as he flew near the mountain.Â 

He then stopped the engine and opened a parachute to bring him safely to land.

After the flights, Mr Rossy told reporters his message to people was to 'hold on to their dreams' and do what they think is impossible.
