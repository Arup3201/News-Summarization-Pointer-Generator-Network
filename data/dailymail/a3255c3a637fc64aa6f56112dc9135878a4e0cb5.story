Thousands of British holidaymakers were trapped in the French Alps after a giant 50-tonne boulder blocked a main mountain road.

Falling rocks cut off popular resorts Val Thorens, Les Menuires and St Martin and ski enthusiasts were left stranded in a 50-mile tailback.

Holiday coaches were stopped from entering and leaving the resorts in the Tarentaise Valley after authorities ruled the N117 road was too dangerous for large vehicles to use on Friday morning.

Tourists took to social media to vent their frustration at being stranded after the rockslide.

Mike Parkes ‏tweeted: 'Delay getting out of Alps due to 100 tonne boulder that has decided to fall into the road! #annoying This never happens to #judithchalmers.' 

Claire Zillman ‏said: '1st for everything: 'a boulder cracked the road so there's no traveling in or out of this village. Skiing in Alps was spectacular until now.'

Tour operators are planning to hire a fleet of minibuses so holidaymakers due to return home yesterday can be taken to their departing flights today.

Hundreds of Britons on their way to the region were accommodated in the nearby town of Albertville.  

Crystal Ski Holidays, one of the British travel firms affected, said it arranged overnight accommodation for  500 UK holidaymakers arriving at Chambery and Geneva airports.

A message on its Twitter feed said: 'The authorities are presently only allowing light diverted traffic out of resort and no traffic up to resort. 

'For customers in resort, please speak to your rep for details of accommodation for tonight. We are working on plans to get you home tomorrow.'

A Crystal Ski Holidays spokesman added: 'People who have departed from various airports are being accommodated at Alberville, just down the valley.

'The authorities are not allowing us to use the road. We are trying to get people through the side roads but these are not suitable for coaches so we are organising a fleet of mini buses. 

'We hope take them to the airport tomorrow.'
