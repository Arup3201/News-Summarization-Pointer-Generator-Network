Injured Arsenal star Jack Wilshere was up with the lark on Friday morning as he recovered from his ankle operation on Thursday.

The 22-year-old faces quite some time on the sidelines, but that was not enough to dampen his spirits as he kicked back and watched the latest sporting news.

Cup of tea in hand and his his foot neatly wrapped in bandages, the Gunners midfielder took to social media to show his fans that his mind is still in the game.

On Thursday Wilshere posted a picture of his ankle in a cast after the operation and insisted he will return soon

Posting a picture on his Instagram on Friday, the England midfielder, who was injured in a challenge with Manchester United defender Patrick McNair, was laid up on a couch with his crutches at his side.

Not wanting to miss a minute of the action, Wilshere wrote: 'Early morning catch up on @SkySportsNewsHQ.'

The injury has led to Wilshere becoming the subject of criticism, with one media outlet saying he has 'brittle ankles.'

Letting loose on his Instagram account once again, the Arsenal man showed an image of the challenge with Paddy McNair that led to his injury. 

'As this picture clearly shows' most people/players would have broken their ankle if someone tackled them like this.

'Luckily I have 'loose joints', not brittle' and only damaged ligaments #Fool #GetTheFacts,' Wilshere finished. 

On Friday, Wenger said of the midfielder: ‘He’s prepared and focused to come back and finish the season well. 

'I think he will be back at the end of February, beginning of March and he will focus on coming back to rehab, having a strong rehab, and then I’m sure he will help us to do well until the end of the season’

The midfielder posted a similar image after his last ankle surgery, on the other foot, in 2013

Wenger does not believe the 22-year-old's persistent injury problems are a result of how he plays: ‘I think his injury is just a consequence of a tackle that is very bad but not malicious because I don’t think that McNair wanted to hurt Jack,’ added Wenger.

‘He has joints that are quite lax and he deals very well with kicks and tackles. This was too hard. When you see it again, I don’t think that anybody would have escaped without surgery in this tackle.’

Wenger confirmed that Wilshere is frustrated by another injury: 'He is very down. He is a football man who loves the game. On the other hand he is very strong as well and has learnt to deal with adversity from a very young age.

The midfielder has been beset by injuries, and will have missed 119 weeks of football by the time he returns

‘He always comes out stronger and when I spoke with him he is already determined, it is already in his mind the final sprint to the season. He is a very strong boy.’ 

Ahead of their trip to West Brom on Saturday, Wilshere's injury leaves Arsenal with three recognised senior midfielders — Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky.

The Gunners will also be monitoring the fitness of captain Mikel Arteta (calf) and Yaya Sanogo (hamstring) following their 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.
