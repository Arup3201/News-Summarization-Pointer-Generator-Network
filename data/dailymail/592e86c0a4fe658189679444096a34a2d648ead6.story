It's one of Disney's famous melodies that's become a chart hit in countries across the world.

But on Thursday afternoon, Karl Stefanovic took on on the challenge to belt out his adaptation of the the classic Frozen tune Let It Go. And his cringeworthy version is sure to send chills down one's spine.

Nine's Today show presenter competed with young Frozen fans, dressed as the animated characters Elsa the Snow Queen and younger sister Anna, as he strains his voice to reach the high notes.

The breakfast program was at the Royal Melbourne Show on Thursday afternoon to film segments for its Friday edition.

Co-host Stefanovic gladly accepted the challenge to a Frozen sing-off - complete with hand actions.

However his fellow contestants seem unfazed by the 40-year-old's lack of relative pitch as one girl simply raised her voice to sing over Stefanovic.

While watching the pre-recorded segment, one presenter commented: 'You look like you're in pain there Karl, are you okay?'

To which Stefanovic responded: 'I was just in the moment.'
