Wales might still be in with a shout of winning the RBS Six Nations crown this weekend but they sit bottom of the table for Twitter mentions during the tournament.

The social media website has measured which team was inspiring most tweets during each match and awarded two points for a win in line with the Six Nations format, and revealed England come out on top with a perfect eight points from four matches.

But Wales, who are hoping for slip-ups from England and Ireland to snatch the title this weekend, are joint last in the Twitter table alongside Italy and Scotland with only two points from their four outings.

England, pictured in training on Thursday, have been the most talked about country on Twitter

France are second, with Ireland third.

There is better news for Wales in the dream XV standings, with five of their players - more than any other nation - earning selection by virtue of being the most talked about player in a given position.

Captain Sam Warburton (flanker), scrum-half Rhys Webb, centre Jonathan Davies, full-back Leigh Halfpenny and winger George North are all in the team.

England have four representatives in hooker Dylan Hartley, flanker Chris Robshaw, centre Jonathan Joseph and winger Jack Nowell.

Two Scotland players - second row Richie Gray and fly half Finn Russell - made the team

However, Ireland's Robbie Henshaw missed out on the 15 despite writing the most retweeted tweet of the tournament so far - his reply to One Direction's Niall Horan.

The tournament opener, which saw England beat Wales 21-16 in Cardiff, remains the most tweeted about match, with the full-time whistle creating the single largest spike in tweets of the entire tournament.

England's 19-9 loss to Ireland was second on the list.

Alex Trickett, Head of Sport Twitter UK, said: 'We know Twitter is the place where people come to share in the biggest moments in the sporting calendar, and it doesn't get much bigger than the Six Nations.

'It has been amazing to see how Twitter has brought rugby fans closer to this tournament, and we can't wait to see this continue to play out during the Rugby World Cup later this year.'
