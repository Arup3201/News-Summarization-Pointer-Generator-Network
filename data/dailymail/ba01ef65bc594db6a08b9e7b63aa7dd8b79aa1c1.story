The Chief Inspector of Schools faced a
barrage of criticism from Conservative MPs last night after he said 
grammar schools are ‘stuffed full of middle-class kids’.

Sir
Michael Wilshaw said the dominance of affluent children meant selective
state schools had almost no role in improving the education of the 
poor. ‘A tiny percentage are on free school meals – three per cent. That
is a nonsense,’ he said.

‘Anyone
who thinks grammar schools are going to increase social mobility needs 
to look at those figures. I don’t think they work.’

His comments angered
Tory MPs who believe expanding the grammar system could help reverse 
the decline in social mobility. Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful 
1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, described Sir Michael’s 
intervention as ‘unwise’.

The
former education spokesman, whose Altrincham and Sale constituency is a
bastion of the grammar school system, said: ‘We have some very bad 
schools in this country and I think the chief inspector would be better 
advised to focus his attention on improving those, not criticising some 
of the good ones.’

Mr Brady 
said grammar schools sometimes ended up selecting fewer children from 
poor homes because they had been failed by the state primary system.

He
said he was ‘angry’ that Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael appeared to
have ignored evidence that high schools that operate alongside grammars
in areas such as Trafford in Greater Manchester show ‘incredibly good 
performance’.

Statistics show areas with selective state schools dominated GCSE and A-level results last year.

Reading
came top, with 45.9 per cent of pupils gaining grades AAB or equivalent
in 2012, followed by Trafford with 34.5 per cent. The state sector 
average is 16.8 per cent.

High-performing local education authorities 
(LEA) with selective schools also included Southend-on-Sea in Essex and 
Torbay in Devon, which have some of the worst areas of deprivation in 
the UK. Seven of the top ten best performing LEAs at GCSE also offered 
grammar school places.

Tory
grandee David Davis, who also went to grammar school, said the system 
should be ‘maintained at all costs’ because it remained ‘the way 
working-class children get their chance in life, on an equal footing to 
children who can go to the private sector’.

He admitted that poorer youngsters had been ‘elbowed out by ambitious middle class parents’ in some areas.

But
he said the decline of grammars had left Britain ‘more dominated than 
it ought to be by the products of private schools’. He suggested this 
could be reversed if the grammar school system was allowed to expand.

However,
in an interview with the Observer, Sir Michael suggested grammar 
schools only helped an elite 10 per cent of pupils – often with pushy 
parents.

It is the second 
blow in a week for the grammar system, following a decision by Education
Secretary Michael Gove on Friday to block an application to create a 
new ‘supergrammar’ in Sevenoaks, Kent.

The
scheme was the first test of new rules that allow grammars to expand on
satellite sites. But education sources said the bid was ‘botched’ and 
would have effectively created a new selective school, which is banned 
under existing law.

Yesterday
the Department for Education refused to be drawn on the comments by Sir
Michael, who also claimed in a wide-ranging interview that summer 
holidays were too long and admitted that when he used the cane during 
his time as a teacher in the 1970s it had ‘never worked’.

But
he highlighted the role that ‘pushy parents’ could play in driving up 
standards. ‘Pushy parents have usually got kids in schools where, 
because they are pushing hard, standards rise,’ he said.
