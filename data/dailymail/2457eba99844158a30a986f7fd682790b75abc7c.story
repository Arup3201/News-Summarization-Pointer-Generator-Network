Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul has been fined $25,000 for criticizing a female official after a loss at Cleveland.

The NBA announced the fine on Saturday. Paul was given a technical by rookie referee Lauren Holtkamp on Thursday night in the third quarter of a 105-94 loss to the Cavaliers, a game that featured five technicals against the Clippers.

After the game, Paul called the technical on an inbounds play 'ridiculous' and said 'this might not be for her.' Holtkamp is one of only two female officials in the NBA.

Paul appeared to say something to her as he waited for an inbound pass after a Cavaliers' free throw. Paul said Friday that he was only upset with the call.

The penalty is in line with others the NBA has levied for criticism of officials. 

Paul got his technical with 10 minutes 17 seconds left in the third. Following a free throw by Cleveland, the Clippers were attempting to inbound the ball quickly when Holtkamp stepped in.

After the game Paul said: 'The tech I got was ridiculous. That's terrible. There's no way that can be a technical. We try to get the ball out fast every time down the court.

Fight: The foul in question happened in the third quarter, when the Clippers were trying to rebound a free throw. Paul was also slapped with a flagrant fould against Cleveland Cavalier Timofey Mozgov (right) in the second quarter

'When we did that, she said, 'Uh-uh'' I said, 'Why uh-uh?' and she gave me a technical. That's ridiculous. If that's the case, this might not be for her.' 

Clippers coach Doc Rivers also received a technical and forward Matt Barnes was ejected in the third by Lewis after getting his second 'T.' 

Barnes got tangled up with Cavaliers forward Kevin Love, shoved him and got the technical. He got the second one when he complained about teammate Jamal Crawford getting called for a charging foul and told Lewis, 'Don't give them the game.'

Barnes is tied for the league lead with 11 technicals and has been ejected twice.

'It keeps happening,' Barnes said. 'Some of these I earn, some of them I don't.'
