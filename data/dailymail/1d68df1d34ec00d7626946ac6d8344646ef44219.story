One of Australia’s top gynaecologists is under investigation for allegedly slapping a nurse in front of a patient.

Professor Margaret Davy has ‘strongly denied any wrongdoing’ as it was confirmed by South Australia Health Minister Jack Snelling that the reported incident is being looked into by officials.

Prof Davy has taken almost a year’s holiday from her job as head of surgery at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, in South Australia, as the investigation gets under way, The Advertiser reports.

The Royal Adelaide Hospital did not deny an investigation is under way but said they could not comment

She told the paper she had no knowledge of the alleged incident, which supposedly happened during a colposcopy procedure when the patient was conscious, and revealed that she has gone on long service leave.

‘I have definitely not resigned as I have 354 days of long service leave so I have a year to think about it,’ Prof Davy told The Advertiser.

The Royal Adelaide Hospital did not deny an investigation is happening when contacted by Daily Mail Australia, but a spokesperson said: ‘We are not making any further comment.’

Daily Mail Australia has also contacted Prof Davy for comment.

Mr Snelling told The Advertiser: ‘I am advised that a formal investigation is under way into this serious allegation.

‘If found to be true I would expect appropriate disciplinary action to be taken.’

Prof Davy, 69, has had a long and successful career in the world of gynaecology.

She graduated from the University of Adelaide and went on to work in Oslo, Norway, for ten years at the Norwegian Radium Hospital where she gained extensive knowledge about gynaecological cancer.

She returned to Australia and worked in Women’s Health for 20 years in remote areas in South Australia and the Northern Territory, a service for which she was awarded the Order of Australia (AM) in 2002.
