Fifteen farm workers in California who fleed the fields to escape smoke and ash from the massive wildfire burning nearby were fired for putting their personal safety above their job.

Strawberry pickers at Crisalida Berry Farms in Oxnard said it became impossible to breath due to heavy smoke pouring from the Springs Fire.

The workers were warned by their foreman that they would lose their jobs if they left early, but they felt their lives were at risk.

‘The ashes were falling on top of us,’ one worker told NBC4. ‘They told us if we leave, there would be no job to return to.’

The next day, May 3rd, the fifteen were handed their pink slips.

Once news of the alleged firing spread, United Farm Workers stepped in to help the workers, even though they are not unionized.

Citing a union rule that prohibits workers from being forced to work ‘under conditions where they feel his life or health is in danger,’ UFW representative Lauro Barrajas managed to persuade the farm to rehire the fired employees.

However, all but one had since found work at other farms and did not return. The farm later claimed the entire thing was a ‘misunderstanding.’

'The ashes were falling on top of us,' one worker told NBC4. 'They told us if we leave, there would be no job to return to.'
