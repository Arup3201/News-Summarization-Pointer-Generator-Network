Gayle King is leaving the morning television show she presented on her best friend Oprah Winfrey's cable channel.

The 56-year-old journalist, who has presented The Gayle King Show on the OWN network since January, has been poached by CBS to help anchor the Early Show.

King will still continue to work with OWN from time to time, but will relinquish duties on her weekday programme.

OWN presidents Sheri Salata and Erik Logan released a joint statement today wishing King all the best.

It read: 'We are so happy for Gayle's opportunity of a lifetime. She'll be a 
fantastic host for the new morning show on CBS and we wish her all the 
best.'

King's appointment comes as part of a major revamp of CBS's morning TV news show.

Charlie Rose, 69, has also been appointed to join King on the Early Show.

Rose already hosts a nightly interview program on PBS.

The new two-hour show, as yet to be titled, will debut on January 9 from
a new studio in New York and replace the network's low-rated 'Early 
Show', CBS said.

Rose will lead the 7 am hour, while King will lead the 8am hour of the show which they will co-host along with current anchor Erica Hill.

CBS said the new morning program would give viewers a 'more thoughtful, substantive and insightful source of news,' giving weight to national and global news stories.

'This program represents a new direction for morning television at CBS,' said CBS News chairman Jeff Fager.

'We will produce a broadcast that is interesting and compelling and on top of the big stories of the day.'

'The Early Show' has long trailed its NBC rival 'Today' and ABC's 'Good Morning America' in TV ratings and is down six percent in viewers this fall compared to last year.

But the make-over signals a departure from the lighter, more entertainment-based fare delivered by NBC and ABC.
