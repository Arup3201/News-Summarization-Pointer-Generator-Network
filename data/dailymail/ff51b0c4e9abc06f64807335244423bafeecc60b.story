YouTube has been criticised for helping to encourage the stereotype of nurses as ‘sexual playthings’.

University lecturer Jacinta Kelly said videos uploaded to the website demean the nursing profession and portray nurses as ‘witless, incompetent’ doctors’ assistants.

She has called on young nurses to upload their own videos to the site to highlight the skilled element of their jobs.

Criticism: Anglia Ruskin University's Jacinta Kelly said YouTube videos of nurses encourage the stereotype of nurses as 'sexual playthings'

Ms Kelly, an acute care lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University, said: ‘It seems that the stereotype of nurses is actually getting worse.

‘Nurses are painted in a very damaging and humiliating way and not only does it affect how other people view the profession but it affects the self confidence of current nurses.’

Her research included an analysis of the ten most-viewed videos for the search terms ‘nurse’ and ‘nursing’, retrieved from the website in July 2010.

'Humiliating': The academic has called for fewer depictions of nurses as stupid and overly sexualised

Most of the videos caricatured nurse-patient relationships as well as those between doctors and nurses – often in a sexualised way.

Three nursing identities emerged, including a nurse as a ‘skilled knower and doer’, a nurse as a ‘sexual plaything’ and a nurse ‘as a witless, incompetent’ individual.
