He's always been proud of his humble Yorkshire roots.

And if Geoffrey Boycott fancies a trip down memory lane, the cramped National Coal Board terraced house where he lived as a young boy is  just a short drive away from his  new home.

In every other aspect, however, his magnificent £1.75million Georgian mansion could be in a different world.

Back to his roots: Cricket legend Geoff Boycott is moving back to his beloved Yorkshire after buying Boston Hall (above) in Boston Spa for £1.75million

Loyalties: Boycott wants to be nearer Yorkshire County Cricket Club, where he is president and his wife Rachel (pictured) is actively involved in the club's 150th anniversary celebrations

The Grade II listed property was built
in 1807 as a ‘gentleman’s residence’ and judging by the superb rooms, 
complete with chandeliers and oil paintings, little has changed over the
centuries.

The cricketing legend has been living away from his beloved home county in recent years for health reasons.

He and his wife Rachel, who have a 
daughter, Emma, have split their time between homes in South Africa and 
Jersey to take advantage of the warmer climate as Boycott recovered from
cancer.

But a desire to be nearer friends and family and cut down on 
travelling has led the 72-year-old to snap up Boston Hall in the 
upmarket West Yorkshire town of Boston Spa.

The property boasts six bedrooms and 
five reception rooms with elegant gardens and the front gates are 
adorned with a pair of golden stag heads.

The mansion was the head- quarters of 
the Ogden Group, an international property developer, but planning 
permission was granted to turn it into a private home and the Boycotts 
were quick to strike a deal.

Grand designs: Boycott and his wife Rachel bought the converted farmhouse to be closer to family and his beloved Yorkshire Cricket Club

Stunning: Boston Hall, which dates back to 1807, is located in the village of Boston Spa, near Wetherby in North Yorkshire

Exquisite: The house boasts six bedrooms, five reception rooms, large sash windows throughout and rolling gardens surrounded by a large terrace

Speaking from New Zealand, where he is
commentating on England’s forthcoming Test series, Boycott said: ‘After
my cancer of the tongue in 2002, once in remission we went to live in 
Jersey for my health, not tax reasons.

‘While we love everything about the 
island, the scenery, the people and the way of life, the extra flying 
back and forth has been tiring and time-consuming.

‘We want to be nearer to our daughter,
Emma, who has just qualified as a lawyer, other family members, our 
friends and Yorkshire cricket.’

Boycott was diagnosed with cancer in 
September 2002 and forced to take food in liquid form to reduce the pain
in his throat.

But he said his spirits were kept up by his wife, whom 
he married in February 2003. The couple’s new home is just a short drive
from the Headingley cricket ground where he is the county club’s 
president as well as one of its greatest former players.

And the 
Boycotts have wasted no time in putting their plans for the mansion into
action. They have applied for permission for an ‘orangery and garage’ 
as well as to carry out internal renovations in the listed building.  
Their home in Jersey, reportedly bought for £1.2million in 2006, is 
likely to be sold.

Born the son of a coal miner, Geoffrey
Boycott was the eldest of three boys who grew up in  the mining village
of Fitzwilliam, West Yorkshire.

The family lived in a two-up, two-down
terraced house and the young Geoffrey went to the local primary school 
where he showed early promise in cricket.

His Test career spanned 18 years and 
he scored more than 8,000 test runs before moving on to a successful 
career as a commentator.

Boycott is without question a very wealthy man but his earnings from his media work have not been disclosed.

In 2011 he unsuccessfully tried to sue
solicitors over advice he was given about a £2.5million property in 
Sandbanks, Dorset, he had bought with former lover Anne Wyatt in 1996.

Boycott had expected to inherit her share when she died in 2009 but she left it to a relative.

Born in 1940, Geoffrey Boycott (pictured right) is one of England's most well-known and well-respected cricketers after he went on to captain both his country and his beloved Yorkshire.

The batsman made his test debut against Australia in June, 1964, at Nottingham, and went on to play a total of 108 tests, scoring 8,114 runs, at an average of 47.72, in the process.

He is considered one of the finest defensive batsmen to have played the game and is the fourth-highest accumulator of first-class centuries in history.

For eight seasons he was the captain of Yorkshire after taking over the role from Brian Close in 1970.

He became the first England cricketer to pass 8,000 Test runs and his Test career included 22 centuries, a record that was recently broken by current England captain Alastair Cook.

Boycott was England captain for the 1978 tour of Pakistan and New Zealand. The year before saw him become the first English player to bat on all days of a five day Test, against Australia at Trent Bridge.

During his 108 Tests, England were defeated just 20 times.
