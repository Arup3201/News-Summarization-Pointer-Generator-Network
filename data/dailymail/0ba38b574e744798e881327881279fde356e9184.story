A failing school has been attacked after advertising for maths teachers with just four GCSEs.

South Leeds Academy is seeking two 'unqualified' teachers for the subject, for which it says the minimum requirement is four GCSEs at A* to C grade.

The criteria - which teachers have said will 'shock' parents whose children attend the school - means that successful applicants could be less qualified than the Government's minimum education standards for school leavers.

The academy has said that one of the four GCSE passes must be in maths 'in order to ensure the highest possible standards of student achievement'.

Lax: The advertisement prominently states that applicants only need four GCSEs to apply

Special measure: Ofsted has branded teaching at South Leeds Academy 'inadequate'

But while the advert says that a degree in mathematics would be desirable for the job, it makes clear that further training is not essential.

The academy school, which has 1,163 pupils, has been in special measures following an Ofsted inspection which found the quality of teaching there 'inadequate'.

A teaching union has branded the advert 'utterly inappropriate', claiming parents at the school will be 'absolutely shocked'.

Colette Jones, principal of the academy, states in the 12-page job pack: 'This is a key role for the academy as we move forward.

'We are now ready to take the next step on our journey to becoming an outstanding academy.

'You will be joining an ambitious, committed and hardworking team who are passionate about the difference we can make to our young people, staff, families and the wider community.'

The job is advertised as ‘temporary until July 2014’ with a closing date for applications of Friday, 29 November.

It lists as essential qualifications at least 4 GCSE’s (A*-C) or equivalent, including English and Maths, being 'an excellent classroom practitioner' and having an understanding of health and safety issues.

Earlier this month the academy - The School Partnership Trust Academies, an educational charity - was issued with a warning letter from a Government minister about the 'unacceptably low standards of performance of pupils'.

All change: 29 members of staff have left the school since June

This followed the latest Ofsted inspection, which found 'serious weaknesses' over the achievement of pupils and the quality of teaching which was judged 'inadequate'.

Since then, 29 teachers, assistants and other staff have left the academy, as have two senior managers.

Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'Parents will absolutely shocked to think that any child of theirs would be taught by someone with four GCSEs.

'The Government talks continually about standards. Four GCSEs do not measure up to the five A*-C they expect the majority of pupils to be achieving at present.

'It gives a lie to Michael Gove’s claims that his policy is to allow top professionals such as engineers to become teachers and shows it is about teaching on the cheap.

'This travesty is a direct result of the coalition Government’s decision to allow unqualified teachers into our classrooms.

'This policy needs to be reversed before we see any more of this utterly inappropriate employment practice being put into action.'

The School Partnership Trust Academies sponsors a chain of 40 academies including secondary, primary, infant and junior schools and claims 'a proven track record of securing transformational change and sustainable school improvement'.

It is led by Sir Paul Edwards, who has acted as an adviser to the Department for Education.
