A poet who fled from the Nazis was stabbed to death by her own 'bully' stepson during a furious family row at her picturesque country cottage.

Writer Anne Cluysenaar, 78, who fled to Britain just before the outbreak of Second World War, was murdered with a kitchen knife by Timothy Jackson at her home in Usk, South Wales after he developed an 'irrational hatred' against his father's wife.

Following the murderous attack, the 49-year-old, who 'drank like a fish and became a wild animal', told police he had killed the elderly woman because she 'tormented and taunted' him.

Just hours before her death, she had e-mailed a friend saying Jackson had made 'an appalling verbal attack and was threatening to become physical'.

When police arrived at the property, they found the university lecturer  with fatal knife wounds to her neck, shoulder and back. 

Jackson, 49, has now been jailed for life at Cardiff Crown Court, with a minimum tariff of 19 years, after pleading guilty to murder.

Her death came just one day after she celebrated her 39th wedding anniversary with her 77-year-old husband Walter.

The court heard how Mrs Cluysenaar, a university lecturer, moved from Belgium when Hitler's armies were closing in. 

She started a life in the UK and eventually became secretary of the Usk Valley Association, editor and poetry editor of Scintilla and a visiting teacher of creative writing at Cardiff University. 

But the court heard the peace of the idyllic home she shared with her husband was shattered when her stepson visited from his home in Sheffield.  

The court heard how Jackson had felt like 'a disappointment and a failure' because his highly-educated stepmother was so well known in academic circles.

But, sentencing him, the judge he had been supported 'materially and emotionally' by the couple.

Judge Neil Bidder told Jackson, a skilled carpenter: 'Your father and stepmother supported you both materially and emotionally.

'But you appear to have developed an irrational hatred of her and the murder was particularly brutal.'

Prosecutor Roger Thomas QC had told the court how Jackson picked up the kitchen knife from a sideboard 'five feet away' during an argument with his stepmother.

He said: 'The knife was clearly a household knife and was in the room and when the murder took place.

'It was obviously picked up in the course of the incident that took place.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard that in the days before the murder, Jackson had been shouting and yelling at his stepmother and was 'choking with anger'.

His father described his son as a strange character and a bully who 'drank like a fish and became a wild animal'.   

The Belgium-born writer was just three when she arrived Britain after her family fled the Nazis during World War Two.

She started writing poetry as an eight-year-old - and went on to write hundreds of poems in her life which were printed in literary journals and magazines.

She had also lectured in literature and linguistics at universities across the country including Manchester, Dublin and Aberdeen.

Mrs Cluysenaar moved to the smallholding with her husband Walt and had lived there for more than 25 years before her brutal murder in November last year.

Detective Chief Inspector Roger Fortey, of Gwent Police, welcomed the sentence passed by the court.

He added: 'Although today's sentencing concludes formal legal process it will not ease their sense of loss, however I hope it will provide a little comfort to them as they move on with their lives.' 

Following her death, Professor Martin Coyle - of the university's School of English, Communication and Philosophy - said Mrs Jackson was highly regarded both as an academic and as a writer.

He said: 'A hugely experienced teacher, she brought talent and understanding to her creative writing classes at Cardiff and was enormously supportive of students.

'In recent years she was part of the Usk Valley Vaughan Association and worked with Dr Peter Thomas on the Vaughan magazine Scintilla.

'Anne loved Wales and all will miss her wisdom and fine writing.'
