It would be designed to look like an eight-mile piece of parkland or an art installation at the water's edge.

But it would serve a much more important purpose than brightening up lower Manhattan.

This is one of more than 40 designs aimed at protecting the New York and New Jersey coastlines from a repeat of the catastrophic flooding that hit the area during Superstorm Sandy a year ago.

The design, submitted by Danish architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group and known as the 'BIG-U', proposes a system of levees and berms that would protect lower Manhattan.

The 'BIG-U', an mile system of berms and levees disguised as art installations and parkland, was one of more than 40 designs entered into a competition aimed at avoiding a repeat of last year's devastating flooding during Superstorm Sandy

The designs are proposed to avoid a repeat of the devastating flooding that hit parts of New York and New Jersey during Superstorm Sandy last year

But the system would be disguised behind murals and plant life, making it look more attractive than your standard flood defence.

The plans were exhibited at New York University as part of a federally funded design competition aimed at protecting the area from future flooding.

The 41 ideas range from the simple to the imaginative, with some proposing to drastically re-alter the appearance of the coast.

Another design group suggested systems of artificial reefs, restored marshland and tidal flats that would take the punch out of surf hitting exposed coast and prevent big floods from pushing deep into bays and tidal estuaries.

Some of the other designs take into account the potential for sea levels to rise as a result of the planet's melting ice caps.

A group of designers called the 
Unabridged Coastal Collective submitted a plan looking ahead to the year
2080 on the Jersey shore.

Much of the area surrounding New York was left underwater following the devastating superstorm a year ago

It
suggested that, by then, people would get to what remained of Long 
Beach Island by water taxi, rather than road, and visit amusement parks 
that would sit on barges, rather than piers.

It is hoped that the most impressive designs that come out of the Rebuild by Design competition will become a reality and some could be implemented using HUD disaster recovery funds.

But the ultimate goal is to have flooding defences designed that could inspire similar projects elsewhere.

Other ideas included a system of channels that would help divert flood water surging up from Long Island's bays and a huge water collection basin that could absorb floodwaters on Manhattan's low-lying Lower East Side.

In the coming weeks the ideas will be whittled down to just 10 by U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, who led President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force.

Henk Ovink, co-chairman of the jury that will be helping Donovan make the selections, told an audience of planners, architects and engineers the goal is to turn the broad concepts unveiled Monday into practical projects that could get federal funding.

Working with the Rockefeller Foundation, the design teams spent several months doing research and touring storm-damaged areas while they prepared their projects.

More than 140 teams originally entered the competition, but that number was previously whittled down to the current group of finalists.

The devastating flooding, seen here in Staten Island in New York, cost the US some $65billion in repair costs

Rockefeller Foundation President Judith Rodin said in a statement that the competition is part of an effort to 'revolutionise' how coastal communities are planned.

She said: 'We're eager to see which ideas move into the design phase, and hope that they all inspire new ways of thinking around planning and development.'

Superstorm Sandy left swathes of New York and New Jersey devastated by flooding when it struck in October 2012.

At least 182 people were killed and $65billion of damage was caused across the US.

It was the second costliest weather disaster in American history behind only Katrina, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
