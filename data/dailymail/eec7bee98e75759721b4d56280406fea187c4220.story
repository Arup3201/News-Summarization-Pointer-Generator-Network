Battle-hardened villagers who maintained a round-the-clock blockade for 1,088 consecutive days to rid their community of an illegal gypsy camp now have to find £20,000 after the travellers won the right for a costly public inquiry.

Residents maintained a three-year vigil at the site in picturesque Meriden, Warwickshire, after it was occupied in May 2010.

Just a month ago they were celebrating and many members broke down in tears as the caravans left the land.

But a fresh appeal means locals will be forced to endure a five-day inquiry as the travellers demand the right to put two caravans back on the eight-acre greenbelt site.

Row: Noah Burton, who owns the contentious gypsy site in Meriden, has won the right for a five-day public inquiry as the travellers have nowhere to go

Exit: On the eve of leaving the site last month a caravan was set alight as members of the gypsy community moved from the land

The last camp: Meriden resident Lawrence Arnold starts to dismantle the protest tent after the last travellers finally left the site in the Warwickshire village in April - but they may have to return

The dedicated 200 locals - known as Residents Against Inappropriate Development (RAID) - kept a constant presence at the site to prevent further development of the land.

The infamous 'Meriden Gypsies' finally lost their epic three-year legal battle to stay at the site after exhausting their last hope when a High Court judge threw out an application for them to remain on the site in March.

They finally abandoned the ruined site on April 21 this year - after burning a caravan and setting fires across the field.

Now landowner Noah Burton claims the gypsies have been left 'scattered across the land' with nowhere to go.

He has appealed the High Court ruling sparking a public inquiry which will be held in August.

Crew: These battle-hardened villagers, who fought for 1,088 days to rid their community of an illegal gypsy camp, now to have to stump up £20,000 for a costly public inquiry

Barren land: An aerial shot of the village and the nearby field, which was turned into an illegal camp site, shows the damage done by the travellers

In recovery: The travellers who lived on the site have been given one month to restore the land to its former green glory

Damage: The field, which has been occupied by travellers since April 2010, was left torn up by vehicles

Doug Bacon, vice chair of RAID, called the inquiry a 'waste of public money' and said it would cost the group around £20,000 out of their own pockets to fight.

Mr Bacon said: 'This planning inquiry is a waste of public money. In total, it will cost around £20,000 to hire a barrister and planning consultants.

'We are determined that this is the wrong place for any type of development with highway dangers, flooding, accessibility, and sustainability issues, which mirrors all the reasons for the adjacent site being inappropriate as confirmed by the local authority and courts.

'They say they need these two pitches because they have nowhere to go but they are living somewhere right now.

'This is the nature of what we are dealing with. Unfortunately what happens is that the developer, Noah Burton, is trying to wear down the system with repeated planning applications.

'It's the thin end of the wedge because if they get planning permission, they will try to extend it.'

Defiant: A traveller fuels a fire at the site in Meriden before they left

Time to leave: A caravan is towed from the site at the end of a 1,088 day year battle in the courts

But Noah Burton called the protests 'pointless' and issued a chilling warning to villagers when he said there would be 'no end' to their battle for the land.

Mr Burton, 48, said: 'There is no "final" appeal in this process, we will keep going till the very end.

'We'll try again in October, and probably wait until the next Government and try again.

'If I could sell the land I would, but I have already tried and there are no takers, so I have nothing else to do with it, and no money to do anything with it.

Goodbye? Locals had hoped to see the end of the camp but a new legal challenge may change that

Celebrations: Residents Against Inappropriate Development members Maz Crawley and Brenda O'Reilly give the camera the victory sign last month - but the battle over the land started again today

Applause: The protest has been ongoing since the group of travellers first moved to the greenbelt land in the village in April 2010

Final caravan: Spokesman and leader of 'RAID', David McGrath celebrates the groups initial victory against the travellers by holding a 'not out' sign up as the protest site's caravan is moved away

Remebered: 'RAID' leader David McGrath, centre, speaks ahead of the moment of silence in honour of their fallen protesters who did not see the day of victory last month

'All we want is for two caravans for elderly people, and space for someone to look after them.

'All this has resulted in is children being forced out of schools, and people scattered around the countryside on the side of roads.

'We just want to use the land, on hard standing, until the council find us somewhere to go.'

A Solihull Council spokesman said: 'Solihull Council can confirm that a public inquiry will open on August 8, 2013, further details regarding the venue and start times will be published within the next few weeks.'
