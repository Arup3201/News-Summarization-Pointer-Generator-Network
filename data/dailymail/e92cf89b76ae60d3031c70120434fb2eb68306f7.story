Sony has been fined £250,000 by the data watchdog for a breach that compromised the personal information of 77 million PlayStation users.

The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) issued the penalty after it found the attack on the Sony PlayStation Network in April 2011 could have been prevented.

Personal information including customers’ payment card details, names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth and account passwords were exposed.

The firm was fined by the British Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after it found the attack on the Sony PlayStation Network in April 2011 could have been prevented. Here, a user tries a 3D headset for the console.

Sony said it believed hackers have obtained the following details from its PlayStation Network users:

It led to millions having to be issued with new bank cards, and around 3 million British users were believed to have been affected.

David Smith, ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection, said: 'If you are responsible for so many payment card details and log-in details, then keeping that personal data secure has to be your priority.'

It said the attack could have been prevented if software had been up to date, while passwords were also not secure.

'In this case that just didn’t happen, and when the database was targeted - albeit in a determined criminal attack - the security measures in place were simply not good enough.

'There’s no disguising that this is a business that should have known better.

'It is a company that trades on its technical expertise, and there’s no doubt in my mind that they had access to both the technical knowledge and the resources to keep this information safe.'

Smith called the case 'one of the most serious ever reported' to the data regulator.

The ICO added that following the breach, Sony rebuilt its Network Platform to ensure that the personal information it processes is kept secure.

The attack affected 77 million users of Sony's online Playstation Network, which lets players compete online and download content

Sony temporarily shut down its network, a system that links gamers worldwide in live play, after discovering the massive security breach.

The company said at the time that personal data from 77 million users of Sony’s PlayStation network had been compromised.

Users were all asked to change their passwords following the breach.

The the firm hit out at the ruling.

'Sony Computer Entertainment Europe strongly disagrees with the ICO’s ruling and is planning an appeal,' a spokesman said.

'Criminal attacks on electronic networks are a real and growing aspect of 21st century life and Sony continually works to strengthen our systems, building in multiple layers of defence and working to make our networks safe, secure and resilient.

'The reliability of our network services and the security of our consumers’ information are of the utmost importance to us, and we are appreciative that our network services are used by even more people around the world today than at the time of the criminal attack.'

The firm faced heavy criticism over its handling of the network intrusion, as it did not notify consumers of the breach until a week after it began investigating unusual activity.

Experts say the move should act as a 'massive wake-up call' for consumers.

Alex Simmons, UK Editor-in-Chief, IGN.com said: 'When hackers took PlayStation Network down in April 2011, gamers were critical over the lack of information from Sony – first when they realised they couldn’t play online or download new games on their PlayStation, and when Sony revealed much later on that personal data was potentially compromised.   

'IGN readers told us their trust for PlayStation Network was severely dented by the issue, and many gamers even said they would switch to other consoles. 

'The whole matter has been a massive wake-up call for consumers to better protect their personal information online because everyone is a potential target.'
