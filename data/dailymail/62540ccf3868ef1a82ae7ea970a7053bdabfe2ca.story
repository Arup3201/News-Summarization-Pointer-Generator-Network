At first glance, both photos resemble the familiar ruins of ancient Athens, instantly recognisable from the countless images printed in guidebooks and on postcards from Greece.

But while one picture does indeed capture a 2,500-year-old monument to one of the world's oldest civilizations - the other is a shocking example of the disappointing legacy of the 2004 Athens Olympics.

The abandoned remains of the Olympic kayak and canoeing venue, built little over a decade ago, bear an eery resemblance to the Dionysus Theatre - one of the city's most popular tourist attractions, which dates back to the 4th century BC.

Olympic stadium: The 7,600-capacity kayak and canoeing venue, built little over ten years ago, bears an eery resemblance to its ancient equivalent after being abandoned to  nature

Ancient tourist attraction: The Dionysus Theatre in Athens was used for festivals in honour of the god Dionysus after being built in the 4th century BC and is still able to accommodate 14,000 people 

The 7,600-capacity stadium appears to be conceding ground to nature, as shrubs burst through the structure's seams between different levels of seating.

Located in the Hellinicon Olympic Complex in Athens, the venue once hosted the canoe slalom events for the Greek Olympic Games - which was estimated to cost the nation more than £6billion.

It was comprised of a competition course, a training run, and a natural warm-up lake, all of which were surrounded by thousands of seats where the public could watch Olympic stars compete.

The drained course now lies in a state of disuse while for the last seven years the country has struggled through a depression, raising questions about how the nation has benefited from the multi-billion-pound event.

Former glory: Just 15 days before the 2004 Athens Games began, teams carried out an operation named 'Clean up-Locked down' in a bid to have the new venues looking perfect for the event. The scene is a far cry from what the arena looks like today

Ruins: An aerial view of the Greek theatre at Tindari, Frazione of Patti in Sicily, looks remarkably similar to the abandoned Olympic venue

The astonishing pictures were taken by Ioanna Sakellaraki, 25, a photographer from Athens who captured of images while exploring the Olympic sports complexes in 2013 - less than a decade after the Games took place.

She said: 'As the particular sports were not popular enough after the Games, the venues were left unused until they gradually ended up in complete decay.

'Few of the other venues had better luck, but in a general context, there was no proper planning with concrete solutions concerning the venues after the Games, so they easily ended up neglected and unused.'

However, Ioanna, who now studies and works in Brussels, Belgium, still thinks Greece benefited from the Games, despite the shocking reality her pictures reveal.

She said: 'During the Olympic Games, a huge infrastructural pattern including the Athens Tram Line, the venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko were developed.

'Moreover, the Karaiskaki Stadium for football, Helliniko Olympic Basketball Arena and the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex (site of the taekwondo, handball, indoor volleyball, and beach volleyball venues) were constructed at the same time.

'According to reports, the overall net economic benefit of the games for Greece was positive even if the post-Olympics planning was not successful enough to make the use of all the sport venues manageable.'

Iconic: The Odeon of Herodes Atticus, built around 161AD, at the Acropolis and Filopappos Monument on Filopappos Hill in Athens, appears to be in better condition than the Olympic kayak venue built ten years ago
