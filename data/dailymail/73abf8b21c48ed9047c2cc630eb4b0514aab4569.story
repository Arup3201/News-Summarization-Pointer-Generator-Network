Police in Northern Ireland are distributing scratch and sniff information cards to help the public identify cannabis farms.

Police will be distributing information cards to the public so they can recognise the warning signs of cannabis cultivation in their own communities.

The cards make people aware of the unique sweet and pungent smell of cannabis plants in full bloom, one of the most important factors in the discovery of illegal plantations.

Justice Minister David Ford said the information, in the form of a 'scratch and sniff' card, was a novel approach to a growing problem.

'The new cards will enable members of the community to help tackle the drug problem in our society, by identifying criminal activity either near their own homes or in the areas where they work,' he said.

It comes as a senior police commander revealed that more than two cannabis farms are being uncovered every week on Northern Ireland. 

From April this year to the end of August, police arrested more than 1,000 people for drugs offences and removed almost £4 million worth of substances from the streets.

Over that same period officers uncovered 49 cannabis factories across Northern Ireland.

Justice Minister David Ford said the information, in the form of a 'scratch and sniff' card, was a novel approach to a growing problem, while PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris the farms were 'illegal and dangerous'

PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris said: 'We know that people may not realise that the empty, run-down house or flat on their street with people coming and going may actually be a cannabis factory.

'It's not just the stereotype of the remote rural dwelling or disused industrial unit.'

They are generating millions of pounds for organised criminals and being used to fund even more criminality, said Mr Harris, adding: 'They are illegal and they are dangerous'.
