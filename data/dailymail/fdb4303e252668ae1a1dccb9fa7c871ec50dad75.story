A number of little penguins have been massacred by a fox that found its way into the National Zoo and Aquarium.

The Canberra zoo's director Trent Russell said the fox entered the zoo over the weekend and took several of the Little Penguins.

The penguin exhibit has been temporarily closed.

The zoo's director Trent Russel confirmed that the incident was being investigated but refused to comment further, saying the enclosure's staff were still too upset to comment

Mr Russell confirmed on Thursday that the penguins had died.

Visitors to the zoo have been asked not to question staff and volunteers about the attack, as they have found it very upsetting.

'Many of them would find this difficult to talk about,' Mr Russell said in a statement.

He said the zoo was investigating the incident.

Little penguins are the smallest species of the sea bird, usually standing about 33 centimetres tall and weighing no more than one kilogram.

They are often found along the southern coasts of Australia and New Zealand.
