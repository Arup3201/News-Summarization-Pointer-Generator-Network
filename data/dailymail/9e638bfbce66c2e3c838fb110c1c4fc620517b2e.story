Eddie Ray Routh (pictured) has been arraigned on two counts of capital murder

The North Texas man accused of killing former Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and another man has been arraigned on two counts of capital murder.

Eddie Ray Routh made a brief court appearance today in Erath County, Texas.

The 25-year-old is an Iraqi War veteran charged with killing 'America's Deadliest Sniper' Kyle and Chad Littlefield in February at a gun range.

After the shooting, Routh fled in Kyle's pickup. He was captured a few hours later at his sister's home in Lancaster.

Routh was indicted in July. His trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 21 and he remains jailed in lieu of $3 million bail.

Kyle is considered to be the deadliest sniper in American history. His account of life during and after war, 'American Sniper', was a best-seller.

In June, Kyle's unforgiving widow, said she refused to accept that PTSD be used as an excuse by her husband's killer.

Talking about Eddie Ray Routh, Taya Kyle said that she had no intention of ever absolving him.

Taya Kyle, 38, told CBS DFW that PTSD is a condition that does influence a sufferers mood, but 'You're not going to blame someone else, in my opinion when you murder two people in cold blood.'

Chris Kyle was the author of the 
bestselling book, 'American Sniper' and was writing a new book, 
'American Gun: A History of the U.S. in Ten Firearms' at the time of his
death. The book is on general release now.

The
sniper was so feared by insurgents in Iraq, that an $80,000 bounty was 
placed on his head and he was known by his nickname of 'Al-Shaitain 
Rama' - 'The Devil of Ramadi'.

Routh, 25, has claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and that Kyle was helping him through his condition.

However, Taya' scorn for Routh's claims are evident through the manner in which she speaks of those who live with PTSD.

Pain: Taya Kyle spoke at length about the loss of Chris Kyle her husband - and brushed off any suggestion that PTSD could be a legitimate reason for her husband's murder by Eddie Routh

'They (those with PTSD) worked through their struggles, just like we work through our struggles. They are phenomenal people and it doesn’t change their character,' said Taya to CBS DFW.

'Might change their mood once in a while, might have sleepless nights, doesn’t make them a murderer.'

Opening up about how she has learned to cope without her decorated husband, Taya became emotional remembering him.

'I miss everything. He was patient, supportive, funny, loving. I miss his hands, hugs. I miss him laughing with the kids every day. I don’t think there’s much that I don’t miss about him. One of a kind.'

During the interview she explained that she still lives with their two children at their Dallas family home and still keeps the house the same as when Chris was still there.

And tragically she revealed how just as Chris had accepted and become comfortable with his decision to leave the Navy, be a full time dad and work on his books, she became aware of a sixth-sense that things might not stay this way.

Having spent years worrying daily about losing her husband in battle, now she had him home, she became gripped by a 'be careful what you wish for' moment.

In an interview earlier this month, Taya said she does not believe that Routh was a PTSD sufferer.

'People who have PTSD don’t talk about it. They don’t use it as an excuse. They carry guns and they do good work and love their families,' she said to the New York Post.

'They struggle, but it doesn’t change their character.'

Taya is hoping that Routh's trial will shed more light on his alleged motives.

'Chris has a lot of experience with guys with PTSD — hunting, shooting and healing,' said Taya.

'For that reason alone, there was no reason not to take him to the range — there’s a lot more information Chris would have needed to not to make that decision.'

Kyle, was a cowboy from Odessa, Texas who grew up hunting deer and pheasant with a rifle and a shotgun his dad bought him.

He never realized he was a good shot until he joined the Navy and got into the prestigious SEAL special operations unit.

'I thought to myself, 'Oh, hell yeah!' It was an honor,' he told Texas Monthly magazine when Army intelligence told him about his infamy.

But his Navy SEAL companions gave him a different name 'the Legend.'

His most legendary shot came outside Sadr City in 2008 when he spotted an insurgent with a rocket launcher near an Army convoy -- 2,100 yards away.

At that distance, 1.2 miles, he fired a shot from his .338 Lapua Magnum rifle. It struck home, knocking the man over dead.

'God blew that bullet and hit him,' Mr Kyle told the New York Post.

Mr Kyle's preferred weapon, though, was a custom-built bolt action rifle with a powerful scope. It was chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum, a cartridge originally developed for hunting North American big game.

However, Mr Kyle said he has found a new use for it -- making long range, highly accurate shots.

'I could hit a target from 1,800 yards, and it would shoot like a laser,' he told Texas Monthly.
