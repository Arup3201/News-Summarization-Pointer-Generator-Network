enjoyed chart hits including Excellent Horse-Like Lady, Footsteps of 
Soldiers, I Love Pyongyang

Romance? The pair walk through Pyongyang's 
Kumsusan Palace where he was paying tribute to his late grandfather Kim 
Il-Sung on the anniversary of his death in 1994

But his father Kim Jong-il, who died in December last year, reportedly ordered him to end the relationship.

A South Korean intelligence official told the JoonAng
 Daily newspaper in Seoul: 'The two have known each other since they 
were in their teens and rumours about the two having an affair have been
 circulating among Pyongyang's top elite.'Â 

The singer, whose popularity peaked 
around 2005, is believed to have been married to an officer in the 
North Korean Army with whom she had a baby.

Date: The couple watch Disney performances by North Korea's new Moranbong band in Pyongyang. It is believed his father Kim Jong-il, who died late last year, ordered him to stop seeing her 10 years ago

Show: Actors took the stage as Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse while others also dressed as Disney characters in the show for Kim Jong Un

There have been no recent reports on the 
current whereabouts of Ms Hyon's husband or baby - or whether the couple 
are still married.

Ms Hyon was seen earlier this year 
performing at an event to mark International Women's Day in Pyongyang 
which the dictator is said to have attended.

The pair were seen together on state 
television on Sunday paying tribute to Kim Jong-un's late grandfather 
Kim Il-Sung on the anniversary of his death in 1994.

North Korean officials have not confirmed her identity.

North Koreans wail theatrically after orders from military chiefs to break down in tears as they stand along the roadside during the state funeral procession of late North Korean leader last December

South Korea media reports had previously suggested she was Kim's younger sister 
Yo-Jong, who is believed to have studied in Switzerland along with him 
in the 1990s. Others suggested she may be Kim's wife or lover.

Secretive: Former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il rarely appeared in public with his wife

Seoul's intelligence agency and unification ministry, in charge of cross-border affairs, declined to comment.

Jong-Un
 took power after the death of his father Kim Jong-Il last December but 
the outside world does not even know his exact age.

An
 unidentified woman pictured standing behind Jong-Un during mourning for
 his late father last December was identified by some sources as the new
 leader's younger sister.

But Yang Moo-Jin of Seoul's University of North Korean Studies said there was 'little chance' the mystery woman was Kim's partner, given that the country's past first ladies have rarely made public appearances with leaders.

'She could be Yo-Jong or perhaps a daughter of one of the mistresses of the late Kim Jong-Il... so that Jong-Un can publicly showcase the solidarity in the ruling family,' Yang said.

Kim Jong-Un's late father, Kim Jong-Il, was married to Kim Young-sook but they rarely made public appearances together and the couple were estranged for some years before his death. He is said to have had a number of mistress.

Jong-Il died in December last year. Thousands of mourners paid tribute to the 'Dear Leader' with many crying on cue after orders from military chiefs
