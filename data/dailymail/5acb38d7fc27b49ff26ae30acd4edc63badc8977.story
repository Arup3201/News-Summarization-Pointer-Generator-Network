Ten firefighters spent two hours trying to rescue a German Shepherd that got stuck in a bush before finally coaxing it out with some dog food.

The alarm was raised by James Greenhouse, 14, who saw the dog jump into a canal in Darlaston, West Midlands.

The female dog tried to swim to the other side but got tangled up in the bush as it tried to scramble free.

Rescue: Firefighters and divers spent two hours trying to rescue the scared German Shepherd

The frightened animal, believed to be two-years-old, was released by two fire crews and a driving team on Monday.

James said: 'At first I could see its head but then it fell further back and I thought it was dead.Â 

'It looked like it was stuck in the dirt - I was calling it and it didn't respond so I tried to dig it out. It was really scared.'

Joanne Delaney, whose nine-year-old son Josh also tried to free the dog before fire crews arrived, added: 'No-one knows who the owner is. The kids have been knocking doors asking if anyone has lost a dog.

After two hours spent trying to rescue the hound, the German Shepherd eventually untangled itself after he was coaxed out with dog food

'You don't know what the temperament of the dog is like so you have to be careful when something like this happens.'

A spokeswoman at St George's Vets in Wolverhampton, said the dog is recovering well.

She added: 'She is fit and well and has had checks which show she is doing okay.

'She obviously came in frightened but is now a lot better.

'If her owner hasn't come forward within seven days, the dog can be re-homed.'

At one point 10 firefighters were crowded round as they tried to delicately release the dog

Free: Firefighters used dog food to encourage the dog out of the bush. After two hours it popped its head out
