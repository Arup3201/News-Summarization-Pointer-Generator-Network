After his contract expired with Newcastle Jets, Emile Heskey hit the town back home with an old teammate.

Liverpool's former number eight was pictured with his wife Chantelle, Stephen Ireland and his partner Jessica Lawlor on a night out as he continues to search for a new club.

The 35-year-old moved to Australia two years ago after a Premier League career spanning two decades.

Mates: Heskey and Ireland played together for two years at Aston Villa

Heskey played for Leicester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Wigan and Aston Villa, making over 500 appearances in English top-flight football.

Ireland and Heskey played together at Villa but neither particularly enjoyed their time in the Midlands. Heskey endured long dry spells and Ireland struggled to hold down a regular place under successive managers.

The former England international has rediscovered his form down-under. Heskey has scored 10 goals in 42 A-League matches - more than he scored in double the amount of games at Aston Villa.
