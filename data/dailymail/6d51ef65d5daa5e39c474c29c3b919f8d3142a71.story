She recently revealed that she wants to 'build a brand' from her name and it seems that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is well on her way to achieving that dream.

The actress and model, who already has her own lingerie line under her belt, has just been unveiled as the face of another brand.

The 26-year-old is Moroccanoil's first ever famous face and shows off her glossy, flowing hair in the new campaign imagery. 

Another coup: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's career is going from strength to strength. Her latest feat? Starring as the face and glossy hair of Moroccanoil's latest campaign

The advertisements run with the tag line 'Inspired' and the ethos behind the campaign is to celebrate and empower women around the world, and not not only in the glossy hair stakes. 

A short-film series to accompany the campaign will soon be unveiled, which features Rosie revealing her own inspirations, along with powerful stories from five other women.

Rosie recently opened up about her looks in an interview with Industrie magazine explaining why it's important for her to be more than a pretty face.

'I realised early on that nothing lasts forever, especially as a model - you have to build something for yourself from it. Looks go and you fade. Modelling is short lived,' she said.

'I wanted something for when I want to take a back seat. There'll be a brand that I'll be sitting at the helm of and enjoying. This is really the start of something I see as a long-term thing.' 

Not just a pretty face: Rosie is currently in Sydney for the launch of the ModelCo Natural Skincare Collection with the event taking place at the Cafe Sydney restaurant

Her biggest project to date is her lingerie range with Autograph at M&S. She's currently sold more than half a million bras in more than 200 stores - and receives personal messages from customers praising her pieces.

'I get tweets every single day from women sending me pictures of themselves in their Rosie for Autograph lingerie, telling me how their experience was purchasing it and how special they feel in it and how comfortable it is. It's been overwhelmingly positive and very humbling for me,' she said.

But of course, underwear is an area in which she's an expert.

'I have been modelling lingerie for most of my career,' she told the crowd at the Vogue Festival in March, adding: 'It is something I have felt confident doing and I love it. Clothes are usually trickier because there is a lot more to them!' 

She is currently in Sydney for the launch of the ModelCo Natural Skincare Collection with the event taking place at the Cafe Sydney restaurant.

Rosie flew into Australia on Sunday for the launch and on Monday did a swimwear photoshoot for the range.

The model and actress is also  gearing up to star in Mad Max: Fury Road alongside Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz and Tom Hardy and has a rumoured beauty range in the works.
