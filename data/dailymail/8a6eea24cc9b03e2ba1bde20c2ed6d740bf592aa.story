Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge insists everyone at the club has overcome the heartbreak of last season.

The Reds were in the hunt to end a title drought dating back to 1990, only for a defeat at home to Chelsea and a draw at Crystal Palace to hand the initiative to Manchester City, who went on to pip them by two points.

It was a devastating end to a campaign when for the majority of the last two months the feeling was that the club stood on the verge of something extra special.

But Sturridge stressed the squad had put that behind them.

'We were heartbroken at the end of last season but we are refreshed this season and mentally ready for a long season, especially with the Champions League,' he said.

'That is something I can't wait to play in and the players can't wait to play in.

'It took a while (to get over the disappointment). It is not easy to get over things like that but everyone is over that now and we look forward to the future and hopefully bringing success the club.'

While Liverpool's 2-1 win over Southampton was far from impressive, they are at least off and running, but following the £75million departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona their chances of finishing in the top four have been written off by many critics.

It is not a concern for Sturridge, his team-mates or manager Brendan Rodgers, and the England striker said the players were not reading too much into their first performance.

'We have confidence within ourselves, we have a belief within the squad we can win every game - no matter what the opposition - with the philosophies the manager has and the individuals we have and how they work collectively,' added the 24-year-old.

'Getting off to a good start is fantastic for us but we understand it is only one game and there are 37 to go.

'It is very early on in the season to be making predictions of who is going to win the league and who are going to be the top four.

'I think we go about our business silently. Last season we were underdogs and this season we are underdogs, I don't think it changes.

'The manager has made great signings and we look forward to the future and having a successful season because everyone is hungry for success.'
