The former West Indies batsman will turn out for MCC in the unique fixture to celebrate the Lord’s bicentenary year.

As well as
 Lara, the MCC side will feature Worcestershire captain Daryl Mitchell, 
former Ireland skipper Trent Johnston, and ex-Durham and South Africa 
batsman Dale Benkenstein.

MCC Head of Cricket and captain for the match, John Stephenson, said: 'We’re
 delighted that Brian is going to be playing in this match, and it will 
be a special treat for all those attending to see him bat again.

'It
 is fitting that the 200th anniversary of a ground steeped in so much 
cricket history is going to be graced by one of the greatest batsman 
ever to play the game.

'Brian’s
 inclusion adds to what is already going to be a very exciting day with 
so much entertainment on and off the field, and it would be great to see
 as many people as possible coming to celebrate the bicentenary of the 
Home of Cricket.'

MCC v Hertfordshire was the first ever match played at the current Lord’s Ground on June 22nd 1814, and to mark the occasion MCC has organised a series of activities, workshops and entertainment around the Ground.

For the first time since 1987, supporters will be allowed to watch the match from in between the perimeter fence and the boundary rope on the Grand Stand side of the Ground.

Come on in: Entry requirements for the Pavilion have been relaxed, with all 500 public tickets sold out

Playing his way: Ireland captain Trent Johnston will also take to the field during the celebrations

Also, entry requirements for the Ground’s Victorian Pavilion – usually reserved for MCC Members – will be relaxed with all 500 public tickets for these seats having already sold out.

Former England internationals John Emburey, Paul Nixon, Matthew Maynard and Dean Headley will be giving unique Masterclass sessions in the MCC Academy during the afternoon.

Bat-makers Hunts County will be hosting a bat and ball making workshop on the Nursery Ground, where spectators will be able to try their hand at putting together their own cricket bats and balls.

The Nursery Ground will also host performances throughout the day from some of the best acts from this year’s ‘Perform Live At Lord’s’ competition, which saw local performers audition for the chance to show their talent at a major match day.

Anniversary Day will include performances from a 63-piece steel band, singer-songwriters and magicians, as well as fairground stalls and face painting, all free of charge.

Tickets are priced at just £10 for adults and £5 for under 16s in any stand. To book tickets visit http://tickets.lords.org or call 0207 432 1000.
