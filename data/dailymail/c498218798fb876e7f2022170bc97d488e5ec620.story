The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry.

In this international week, we are begging for goals, and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 20-11 of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League... do you agree? 

20. Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)

Still in the prime of his career, there’s every chance Sergio Aguero could end up higher in this list if we were to re-visit it in five years' time. But 64 goals in 98 league outings for Manchester City isn’t a bad start. City paid a pretty penny - £38m - for the Argentine’s service back in 2011 but he didn’t waste any time making an impression, scoring a 30-yarder on debut against Swansea.

And, of course, his dramatic last-gasp goal against QPR to win City the title will never be forgotten. He is arguably the best striker in the Premier League at the moment, as 12 goals in 11 games so far this season in an otherwise shaky team have testified.

19. Carlos Tevez (West Ham, Manchester United, Manchester City)

From one Argentine hotshot to another, Tevez dragged West Ham to Premier League survival in 2007 with seven priceless goals, including the winner at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. His move to Manchester United that summer was protracted but Tevez was an instant favourite, winning hearts for his committed and high-energy performances. 

Sir Alex Ferguson bought him to score important goals and that’s what he did, especially in his first season when he ended up a Premier League and Champions League winner. 

Calls to 'sign him up' fell on deaf ears and Tevez joined rivals City, prompting the famous 'Welcome to Manchester' billboard. Tevez struck 23 and then 20 league goals in his first two seasons, and netted 58 times in all before leaving for Juventus.

18. Luis Suarez (Liverpool)

Some would argue with his racism and biting controversies, Suarez should be nowhere near this list. But we’re hear to talk purely about goals and 69 Premier League strikes in 110 matches for Liverpool means there is certainly a place. This was the man who powered Liverpool to within touching distance of their first post-1992 title last season with 31 goals. And the season before that, he claimed 30. 

Suarez averaged a hat-trick every 20 games, the best rate of all the players to have score more than one treble in the Premier League. Aided by Daniel Sturridge, he smashed all kinds of records last season and, despite adversity, won the Golden Boot and the PFA Player of the Year award.

17. Stan Collymore (Nottingham Forest, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Leicester City, Bradford City)

One of the Premier League’s finest strikers of the mid- to late-Nineties, Collymore scored a remarkable 41 goals in 65 league appearances for Nottingham Forest and 28 in 64 for Liverpool. After helping Forest back up to the top division in 1994, Collymore’s 22 goals helped them to an unexpected third-place finish. Forging an irrepressible strike partnership with Robbie Fowler, he averaged a goal every 2.5 games for Liverpool and created many more. His dramatic late winner against Newcastle United, destroying their titles hopes in 1996, will never be forgotten.

16. Matt Le Tissier (Southampton)

The ultimate one-club man, Le Tissier’s record of 100 Premier League goals and 209 overall for Southampton rivals any attacker. He was already an established goalscorer by the time the Premier League was formed in 1992 and continued in the rich vein afterwards. He had an uncanny ability to score classy goals - that immaculate control and blistering finish against Newcastle in 1993 sticks in the memory. 

Oh and the touch, swivel and 30-yard volley later in the match. His awesome penalty record must not be overlooked either - unfazed by pressure, he scored all but one of his spot-kicks. Little wonder he is worshipped as 'Le God' on the south coast.

15. Dwight Yorke (Aston Villa, Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Birmingham, Sunderland)

With his smile and relaxed gait, Yorke is probably the most laid-back striker on this list but when it came to the business of scoring goals, he was deadly serious. The hotshot from Tobago first shot to prominence at Aston Villa, converting to a striker in the 1995-1996 season and helping Villa to League Cup success. In all, he scored 73 league goals for the club both before and after 1992.

Yorke joined Manchester United in 1998 and was the missing piece in Ferguson’s jigsaw as his haul of 29 goals and telepathic partnership with Andy Cole ended in Treble glory. He continued to score at a prodigious rate for United, helping them to a further two Premier League titles in 2000 and 2001.

14. Gianfranco Zola (Chelsea)

The man Claudio Ranieri described as a ‘wizard’ and Alex Ferguson called a ‘clever little so-and-so’ was the star of Chelsea’s first cosmopolitan team in the late Nineties. His £4.5m price tag proved a bargain and he helped Ruud Gullit’s team to FA Cup glory in 1997, as well as the League Cup and European Cup-Winners’ Cup the following season.

Gloriously skilful and a regular goalscorer, he was adored by the Chelsea faithful, who voted him their best-ever player in a 2003 survey. In all, he scored 59 goals in 229 league matches for the Blues. His audacious mid-air back heel against Norwich in the FA Cup in 2002 was the pick of his goals.

13. Teddy Sheringham (Nottingham Forest, Tottenham, Manchester United, Portsmouth, West Ham)

Sheringham’s professional career spanned an incredible 24 years, giving plenty of time to fit in his grand total of 355 goals. His first Premier League involvement was with Forest, briefly, and then Tottenham, with whom he became the maiden season’s top scorer in 1992-1993. He continued to score at a furious rate before moving to Manchester United for £3.5m in 1997 as the replacement for Eric Cantona. 

The success and silverware that eluded him for most of his career quickly arrived, with three Premier League title wins, an FA Cup and the Champions League. He famously scored United’s last-gasp equaliser in the final with Bayern Munich and was named PFA Player of the Year in 2001. He returned to Spurs after United and also represented Portsmouth and West Ham, finally hanging up his shooting boots aged 42.

12. Ruud van Nistelrooy (Manchester United)

One of the best goal poachers the Premier League has ever seen, Dutchman Van Nistelrooy scored at an incredible rate for Man United, 150 times in all across just five seasons. His £18.5m transfer from PSV Eindhoven in 2000 was put back a year because of concerns over his knees but once in the United attack, there was no stopping him.

RVN scored 23 in 32 league games in his first season, including in eight consecutive matches, then 25 in the next as United regained their title. He was the league’s Player of the Season in 2003 and later broke Denis Law’s European scoring record. He scored 21 goals in his final season at United before joining Real Madrid.

11. Les Ferdinand (QPR, Newcastle United, Tottenham, West Ham, Leicester City, Bolton Wanderers)

Direct and deadly in front of goal, Ferdinand racked up 149 goals in the Premier League. The first of those came with QPR and in the inaugural PL campaign, his 20 goals carrying the west London club to an unlikely fifth place finish. He backed this up with hauls of 16 and 24 in the next two campaigns, prompting title challengers Newcastle to pay £6m for his services. 

His 25 goals in 1995-1996 took Newcastle to within touching distance of the title, though they ultimately blew a 12-point lead to allow Manchester United to profit. Forging a successful partnership with Alan Shearer, he scored 41 league goals in all on Tyneside. After moving to Tottenham, his vital goals spared them from relegation and he later played at West Ham, Leicester and Bolton.
