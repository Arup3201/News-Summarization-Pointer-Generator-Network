Tired: Sophie Pearl Dalzell, 20, was handed 400 hours of community service after attacking two police officers but claims she finds it 'too tiring'

A glamour model who drunkenly attacked two police officers is refusing to carry out community service because it is 'too tiring' for her.

Sophie Pearl Dalzell, 20, from Manchester, was ordered to 400 hours of litter-picking after the 2012 assault.

Months later, she was hauled back to court for skipping probation meetings to get a second breast enlargement in Belgium.

It came after she refused to wear an electronic tag for a separate offence because it interfered with her adult TV work.

Now, with 180 hours of community work left to complete, Dalzell has declared she has ground to a halt because she 'just can't physically do it'.

Dalzell, who has 11 previous convictions, was handed the community order, a £1,000 fine, and put on a Thinking Skills course, in May 2013.

Despite completing more than half the sentence, it has now been seven months since Dalzell last picked litter - and she claims she intends to go away for summer to Ibiza.

'At the moment I am refusing to go because I hate everything about it,' she told The Sun.

'They make you work from 8am until 4pm. It's a waste of a full day and it's just too hard for me.

'I
 get paid a minimum of £500 for a photoshoot and the rest of the time I 
just chill out, so I don't think the courts should be able to put me on 
community service because I find it too hard and tiring.'

Her words come a week after she avoided a penalty and potential prison sentence for skipping her probation meetings to get a breast enlargement - her second - in Brussels.

The court acquitted the model of her alleged breach after she produced a note from the surgeon.

The law states that defendants can miss a probation meeting but only for a valid reason and if proof, such as a letter from a doctor or employer, is given.

After being cleared at Manchester Magistrate's Court, Dalzell said: 'I'm just annoyed I have had to go through this when I haven’t done anything wrong.

'I went for a breast enlargement. They were fine about it at the time and now they have tried to breach me for it.'

She was convicted last year after assaulting two police officers during a night out in Workington, Cumbria.

It was months after she was ordered to wear an electronic tag when found guilty of slapping a male driver in the face and kicking his car in a row outside a Manchester nightclub.

However, when security firm G4S turned up to fit her tag, she refused to let them put it on her ankle, claiming she would get the sack if she wore it.

Convictions: Dalzell, who has 11 previous convictions, was also handed a £1,000 fine and ordered to enroll in a Thinking Skills course after her attack on two police officers in 2012 in Workington, Cumbria

Dalzell, who was working for late night TV channels at the time, was hauled back into court and fined £200.

On Tuesday, magistrates told her that she still had to pay more than £150 in unpaid fines.

John Morris, defending, said: 'There certainly seems to have been a breakdown in the relationship between some probation officers and the client.'

Magistrates were previously told she no longer worked in adult TV and had since moved into modelling, photoshoots, hosting and other presenting jobs.
