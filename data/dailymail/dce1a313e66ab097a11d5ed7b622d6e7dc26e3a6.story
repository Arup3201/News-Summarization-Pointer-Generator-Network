A series of advertising billboards using what appeared to be a mysterious foreign language and symbols  sparked terrorism fears after springing up in New Mexico.

Residents were reported to have hurled obscenities at the workmen as they were putting up the signs along the interstate after mistaking them for Islamic State adverts.

Much to the relief of locals they were later revealed to be the work of Los Angeles based artist Daniel Small and were said to be depictions of the Ten Commandments.

A series of advertising billboards using what appeared to be a mysterious foreign language sparked terrorism fears.

The billboards were installed along Interstate 10 in southern New Mexico by art organisation Los Angeles Nomadic Division

A total of 10 large posters were installed along Interstate 10 as part of the art series titled Pending Cipher for the Open Present.

They feature a fictional language created using Cypriot Greek and a form of paleo Hebrew over stills from the 1923 film the Ten Commandments, according to hyperallergic.com.

They are part of a wider moving art project created by Los Angeles Nomadic Division. 

Delivery driver Craig Melton reportedly described the signs as 'pretty weird,' according to Las Cruces Sun News.

'You never know, we're close to the border and you think that ISIS or some other subversives might be trying to get at us,' he was reported to have said.

He claimed that as they were installed a group of locals surrounded the workmen 'shouting obscenities and claiming that the billboards were either Satanic or Islamic,' according to hyperallergic.com.  

The billboards were created by Los Angeles based artist Daniel Small and titled Pending Cipher for the Open Present

One local said: 'I thought terrorists were making their way into the city,' after spotting the signs

Another local said: 'I thought terrorists were making their way into the city.' 

Others complained of being in America and not understand the signs.

'Feel like I'm back in Afghanistan when I see it,' another said, according to gawker.com.

'How about putting up the ten commandments all over the US...' 

But Samantha Frank, territorial director of the Los Angeles Nomadic Division, a nonprofit organization that promotes public art exhibitions, told the Las Cruces Sun News that the billboards were part of a moving gallery of contemporary art.

Another local, who saw the billboards, added: 'I feel like I'm back in Afghanistan when I see it'

The LAND website states: 'The ten billboards depict text from the Decalogue Stone, believed by many as an attempt at writing the Ten Commandments, in a language derived from Cypriot Greek and ancient Hebrew. 

'Small has added modern day proofreading marks to this pseudo-language, creating illusory hieroglyphs superimposed on images taken by the artist in Guadalupe, CA where DeMille demolished and buried the ersatz Egyptian city set used in film from 1923.'

The entire Manifest Destiny Billboard Project is travelling between Jacksonville and Los Angeles.

The organisation received a $50,000 grant to help fund the project, according to Las Cruces Sun News. They were also donated advertising space.

It started in October last year and is set to finish in June. 

The signs feature a fictional language created using Cyrpiot Greek and a form of paleo Hebrew
