The woman who claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew during her time as a 'sex slave' for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein is now having her credibility questioned following a new report that reveals she previously accused two young men of rape. 

Virginia Roberts, 31, is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join Epstein's harem of underage women in 1999, naming Prince Andrew and attorney Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she was made to 'service'. Both men strongly deny the claims. 

It has now been revealed that just months before she was introduced to convicted-pedophile Epstein, then 14-year-old Roberts accused two acquaintances of rape.

The Daily News uncovered court records which show prosecutors decided not to press formal charges due to Roberts' 'lack of credibility' as a victim.  

According to the records, police started investigating the case on the insistence of Roberts' mother and after a report made by a social worker at a group home.  

While officers at first had a hard time getting in contact with Roberts because she was living at a medical facility, she eventually told them her side of the story. 

She reported that in early February 1998, she had been drinking alcohol and smoking pot in a wooded area near West Palm Beach with friends Josh, 18, and Kevin, 17, when she passed out. (Their full names were not reported since they were not formally charged with a crime.)

She says she later woke up to both of the young men taking turns raping her - an ordeal she says went on for about five to seven hours.

Roberts recalled being dropped off at Josh's house later where he had sex with her again. 

When officers tracked down the two men later the following summer, both testified that it was a consensual threesome. 

A detective who spoke with Josh reported that the young man said the girl was tired and that he urged her to do to sleep. He says she then 'said to him something to the effect of "why don't you keep me awake."' So he thought it was consensual when they had sex following that statement. 

Accusations: The 1998 rape case never went to trial because prosecutors said Roberts lacked credibility. She went on to serve as a sex slave for Epstein (left) for three years. In addition to having sex with Prince Andrew, she says she was forced to service attorney Alan Dershowitz (right) as well. Dershowitz and the Prince have strongly denied the claims 

'At no point did I hear no, I guess that's the important thing,' Josh said, according to the police report.

Josh surrendered to police in August 1998 and was booked on a charge of lewd assault upon a child. He told the Daily News that he only saw Roberts once again after that night and that he was completely surprised by the accusation. Kevin was processed as a juvenile.

However,  prosecutors decided to drop the case in October 1998 due to Roberts' 'lack of credibility and no substantial likelihood of success at trial.'

Michael Salnick, the defense lawyer who represented Kevin in the rape allegations, says the fact that prosecutors didn't believe Roberts would be a believable victim could hamper her current lawsuit.  

'She needs to be careful the past doesn’t come back to haunt her,' he told the Daily News. 

But one of Roberts'  current lawyers says the previous case proves nothing. 

'For the prosecutors to describe her as not credible means only that they did not think they had sufficient evidence to win. But she was raped,' attorney Sigrid McCawley said in a statement. 'And to be victimized all over again with the leak of sealed juvenile records is disgraceful.'

According to court records connected with Roberts' current lawsuit, she maintains that she was recruited to join Epstein's harem in 1999 by his friend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. 

She says during the three years she worked for Epstein, she was made to entertain his friends and named Prince Andrew and Dershowitz as two men she had sex with. 

Both men have denied having sex with Roberts, and Dershowitz is trying to get  his name removed from the suit, claiming Roberts made the entire story up. 

Epstein, 61, has already served 13 months behind bars after admitting to soliciting sex from the underage girls.
