He's 17-years-old and has been crowned the world's number one mathematician.

Melbourne high school student Alex Gunning proved he is the creme de la creme by attaining a perfect score in the International Mathematical Olympiad in South Africa in July - the first time this has been achieved for Australia.

While it's the second time he's brought home gold from the competition, there's no room for complacency for the arithmetic genius who's already looking to compete next year and aim for a hat trick.

'Obviously I'm pretty pleased about it but now I want to try and get gold again next year and even get another perfect score,' Alex told Daily Mail Australia.

'I really enjoy solving the problems at the Olympiad. I think they're quite interesting.'

The year 11 student at Glen Waverley Secondary College, south-east of Melbourne, was among 500 contestants from 103 countries who sat two exams, each consisting of three problems. They were given four and a half hours to solve each paper.

Alex, who put in hundreds of hours of practice in the lead up to the competition, says he came out of the exams feeling confident.

'It's hard to be sure about your performance after an exam but I remember feeling quite happy with myself,' he said.

Although the world champion mathlete says he only realised his talent three years ago when he began entering competitions, Glen Waverley Secondary College assistant principal Sandra Erickson knew Alex was an 'exceedingly gifted student' as soon as he enrolled at the school.

'He's so intelligent but he doesn't see himself any different from other students,' Ms Erickson said.

Ann Ronning, manager of the Australia Mathematics Trust, says  Alex is the 'rock star of mathematics'.

'Australia has been competing in the Olympiad since 1981 but Alex is quite a wonder and we're so thrilled with his results,' Ms Ronning said.

'He went into the competition with the ambition of achieving a perfect score and we thought if anybody can do it, it's Alex.'

Ms Ronning says if Alex wins gold next year, he will be placed 11th of the IMO Hall of Fame.

He is currently ranked 97th - the second Australian in the top 100, after Peter McNamara who is placed 94th.

Alex was among a six-member secondary school team who were sent to Cape Town for the competition from July 3 to 13. Overall, the team scored one gold, three silvers and two bronze medals.

Alex shared first place with students from China and Taiwan.
