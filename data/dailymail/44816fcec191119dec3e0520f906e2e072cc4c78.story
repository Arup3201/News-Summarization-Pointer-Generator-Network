Thousands of people around the country took to the streets to protest the federal government's controversial first-term budget on Sunday.

The protest, billed as Bust The Budget, aimed to send a message about voter dissatisfaction with the budget on the day before the new Senate sits for the first time.

The first rally to kick off was in Brisbane with 800 people marching through the CBD.

More than 2,000 people turned out in Sydney's CBD carrying trade union flags and budget-protest placards.

Greens leader Christine Milne told reporters at St Andrew's Square on George Street that the protest was borne out of frustration against planned federal cuts to health and welfare spending.

'[Tony Abbott] is making life harder for people,' she said. 'He's making life a misery for people who are unemployed and searching for work.'

The anti-budget rally in Canberra featured a three-metre Tony Abbott puppet with smoke coming out of his trousers.

Several hundred protesters converged on the lawns in front of Parliament House and chanted 'One term Tony' and 'Liar, Liar, Pants of Fire' at the puppet.

'We may have to call the fire brigade to put his a*** out,' one protester yelled.

The largest protest in the country was held in Melbourne, with Trades Hall claiming that 20,000 people gathered for the rally.

Among those at the rally were representatives of various unions, as well as teachers, firefighters and nurses.

ACTU secretary Dave Oliver called the protest 'only the beginning of the fight back against the budget,' which he called 'cruel' and leading to a 'growing class of working poor,' the Herald Sun reported.

A union official at the Adelaide protest claimed the federal budget delivered pain right across the community, which was proved by the diverse turn-out of protest marches.

'We had a very broad cross section of the community,' SA Unions state secretary Joe Szakacs told AAP after several thousand people marched in central Adelaide on Sunday.

As well the Sydney protest, pictured, others were held across the country, including Canberra, Adelaide, Darwin and Melbourne

'Pensioners, young people, students, working people, people with disabilities, families ... because we know that this budget attacks everybody and no-one is safe.

'Collectively now, those people are standing up.'

The crowd marched from Victoria Square to Parliament House, and they called for South Australian members of the senate to oppose the budget bills.

'Many I spoke to also said this was the first time they've been to a political rally - saying they they feel angry, they feel scared, and it's time to fight back.'

At the Sydney protest, Ms Milne urged incoming senators to listen to community unhappiness and block budget measures.

'You need to join with us in busting the budget,' she said.

Several of the government's budget measures, including the $7 GP visit co-payment, changes to jobless benefits, a higher pension age and deregulation of university fees have been criticised as unfair.

People at the rallies were from various professions including  teachers, firefighters and nurses

Union representatives were also present at many of the protests

Ms Milne said the Greens will not support the GP co-payment scheme.

Treasurer Joe Hockey has said the criticism has "drifted to the 1970s class warfare lines" and his budget was about equal opportunity, not equality of outcome.

'Our duty is to help Australians to get to the starting line, while accepting that some will run faster than others,' he said in June.

Unions NSW secretary Mark Lennon said at Sunday's protest there had not been such continuous outrage against a budget in 30 years.

'People are going to come here to [Sydney] Town Hall and make it very loud and clear what they think about what happened on May 13,' he said.

Among the measures being protested today were the $7 GP visit co-payment, changes to jobless benefits, a higher pension age and deregulation of university fees
