A pokey one bedroom flat in central London has hit the market for more than the price of a 14-bedroom Devon mansion. 

The pied-a-terre in Rochester Row, Victoria, has just 336sq/ft of space, which is around the size of a large master bedroom. 

It was originally a studio flat, but a screen has been installed to create a separate bedroom. 

The property, less than a mile from the House of Commons and Big Ben, has been put on the market for a staggering £449,000 - more than double the average house price in England.

Indeed it is £50,000 more than a Devon mansion that is also currently on the market.

Exwick Old Manor is a 14-bedroom period house built in Exeter in the 1870s by William Gibbs, a religious philanthropist and wealthy businessman. 

It has eight bathrooms, is 20 times the size of the London flat and the dining room is larger than the entire one-bedroom flat 

It also comes with its own chapel, an acre of land and a huge conservatory.

Across London as a whole, the average home is now worth more than half a million pounds, according to the latest Land Registry figures.

The average price in Greater London is currently £523,953. This is compared to the average house price in of £177,766 in the rest of the country. 

It is not only flats that are up for grabs. In July last year, a row of three 1950s garages near Wandsworth Common sold for £500,000 - four times the guide price - after an auction bidding frenzy. 

In May, six garages in affluent Parsons Green sold for £700,000.

And in April, a run-down garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court, off Peckham Road, went for £550,000 after a bidding war.

The brick-built former coach house was used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark's car.

Parking spaces have also boomed in price, with a single space offered in a car park under the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington, west London, for £400,000.   

The mansion is on the market with Jackson Stops & Staff, while Druce are offering the studio. 

Despite costing £449,000, the agent selling the flat believes it is attractively price.

Simon Armitage from Druce, South Kensington and Chelsea, said: 'This studio offers good value for the central London location - at £1,300 per sq/ft it is £300 - £400 cheaper per sq/ft than a similar property in South Kensington.

'It is also offered on a sought-after long lease.'
