He's fallen out with several family members, been forced to move out of the ancestral home set on a 4,500 acre estate, and has been claiming £71-a-week Jobseeker's Allowance.

But now the Earl of Cardigan is embroiled in a fresh drama - he is in a row with his uncle and a gamekeeper who he claims set up illegal snares on the family's land.

The Earl has made a criminal complaint and said his dog Lucy 'suffered an appalling injury' when her leg became trapped in one of the devices.

His uncle Lord Charles Brudenell-Bruce and gamekeeper Peter Tilley strongly deny the allegations.

Lord Cardigan has put up warnings to dog walkers about the snares across Savernake Forest, in Wiltshire, which has been owned by the family for the last 1,000 years.

It is the latest drama in the life of the 60-year-old Old Etonian who has fallen out with his father, his son and has barely spoken to his daughter Bo Bruce, who starred on The Voice, since 2005.

He has been forced to move out of Tottenham House - the Grade  I-listed, 19th-century Palladian mansion with even older gardens laid out by the famed landscaper Capability Brown - on the Savernake Estate.

The Earl has most recently been working on and off as a delivery driver for a company that provides items to private jets at Heathrow Airport, using his family name David Brudenell-Bruce.

On a typical day, he’ll be sent to a store such as Harrods to pick up caviar and other select goods, then drive to the tarmac at Heathrow.

In recent years he has been prosecuted for assault and criminal damage and has gone through a messy divorce with his first wife.

The fresh snare drama was sparked when his dog injured herself in the forest and the Earl spotted several more traps.

He has asked Wiltshire Police to charge Lord Brudenell-Bruce and Mr Tilley under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1982.

A spokesman for the force confirmed that the incident was under investigation.

'Wiltshire Police have received a complaint regarding the use of snares on the Savernake Estate,' he said.

'Our rural crime officers attended the area and now investigating this matter to ascertain the legality of the traps and where they were positioned.'

The Earl said that his dog had been very badly injured by a snare.

'My dog Lucy suffered an appalling injury to her leg in a snare. I found them close to my house,' he told the Daily Express.'They were near to a pheasant rearing pen. My uncle is responsible for the good conduct of the shoot in the forest.'

Gamekeeper Peter Tilley said that all the snares were legal.

Old Etonian David Brudenell-Bruce is descendant of the 7th Earl who famously led the disastrous British cavalry charge of the 600 in 1854 against the Russians in the Crimean War.

Their title goes back to 1611 when James I created the Baronetage of England and offered titles to 200 men to help with the settlement of Ireland.

They have lived on the same estate in Wiltshire for 1,000 years.

They rode 'into the jaws of Death, into the mouth of Hell', wrote Tennyson in his poem commemorating the suicidal attack.

An appalling series of misunderstandings led to the Brigade advancing down a different valley from the one commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, had intended when he dictated ambiguous orders for Lord Lucan, the cavalry commander.

Despite the fact that the order seemed to demand the cavalry to attack the Russian artillery without infantry support - in contravention of all accepted laws of military practice - an incredulous Lucan passed the instructions on to the Earl of Cardigan, who commanded the Light Brigade, and the troops advanced.

664 men took part and 110 were left dead.

'I have been a keeper in the forest for 44 years and I have an unblemished record. These allegations are rubbish but I find them quite upsetting considering the efforts I have put in over those years,' he told The Times.

'All my snares are legal and I left them closed when that pen went out of use. I first heard about these leaflets three of four weeks ago and they had my telephone number on them.'

Lord Charles has not commented.

The Earl has been involved in a court dispute with the two trustees of Savernake who control his family's estate by managing its assets and finances. He has a 49 per cent share in it, while his son Thomas, Viscount Savernake, owns 51 per cent.

The Earl appointed the trustees — one of whom was a trusted friend of more than 30 years — several years ago to help him manage the estate’s complex affairs. But now the he says the trustees are refusing to give him access to his own money.

His dispute with the trustees goes 
back to April 2011, when he returned from a self-imposed exile in 
America with his new bride to discover that the trustees had removed 
around 25 valuable paintings from Savernake Lodge, against his wishes.

They
intended to sell them, they said, to fund his divorce settlement from 
his first wife Rosamond, Countess of Cardigan. A desperate legal battle 
by the Earl to have the  portraits returned was unsuccessful, and most 
have now been sold.

Since
his return, he says the trustees have refused to give him a penny from 
the estate. Last October, he launched a fresh claim at the High Court to
seek the removal and replacement of the trustees.

The case has yet to be heard but the trustees deny any wrongdoing and are defending the Earl’s claim.

Understandably,
given the background, relations between the Earl and trustees are 
extremely tense. One of them, John Moore, has made a number of 
complaints to the police against the Earl, which has resulted in Lord 
Cardigan making several appearances at court.

The most recent was in January at 
Swindon Crown Court, on a charge of criminal damage and theft at 
Savernake. The Earl denied damaging six pheasant feeders, worth £66, and
the theft of a battery and electrical power unit, worth £80. No 
prosecution evidence was offered and the Earl agreed to be bound over to
keep the peace for 12 months.

A
few days beforehand the Earl was acquitted of assaulting Mr Moore, who 
had accused him of spitting at him and waving a stick in his face. 
Salisbury Magistrates Court rejected his  version of events.
