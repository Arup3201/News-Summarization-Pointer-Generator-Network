Los Angeles Kings defenseman Viatcheslav 'Slava' Voynov, who allegedly punched, kicked and choked his wife, was ordered on Monday to stand trial on a felony domestic violence charge.

The 24-year-old Russian is scheduled to be arraigned on December 29 on one count of corporal injury to a spouse with great bodily injury.

During a preliminary hearing before Superior Court Judge Hector M. Guzman, officer Gregory Wiist of the police force in suburban Redondo Beach said he spoke to Voynov's wife, Marta Varlamova, at a hospital in the early morning hours of October 20.

'She was crying, sobbing,' Wiist said. 'I saw tears streaming down her face. She was an emotional wreck.'

Wiist said Varlamova had a bleeding cut above her left eye and red marks on her neck and told him she was involved in a physical altercation with her husband.

According to Wiist's testimony, Varlamova told him the couple argued at a Halloween party on the night of October 19, where Voynov punched her in the face.

When they went home, the argument continued and Voynov threw her to the ground repeatedly, kicked her and choked her in an attack that continued until she was pushed into a television, suffering a cut on her head that needed eight stitches.

Los Angeles Kings defenseman Viatcheslav 'Slava' Voynov, who allegedly punched, kicked and choked his wife (pictured with their daughter), was ordered on Monday to stand trial on a felony domestic violence charge.

Voynov, who took his wife to a hospital, was later arrested there after medical staff called police.

Voynov, who has denied wrong-doing, was promptly suspended by the NHL, who fined the Kings $100,000 this month for allowing him to skate with the team during a practice.

Voynov, of Chelyabinsk, won two Stanley Cup championships with the Kings in 2012 and 2014.

Varlamova, who wasn't present at Monday's hearing, has previously said she didn't want her husband to be charged because she doesn't believe he was trying to hurt her.

'Marta does not believe that Slava is a threat to her and doesn’t believe that he was trying to hurt her,' attorney Michael Walsh told the Daily Breeze. 'He certainly says he was not trying to hurt her. It was just an unfortunate thing that occurred.'

She moved back in with him shortly after the incident. 

Voynov's attorney, Craig Renetzy, has said that the incident was no more than an accident.

The couple were reportedly shocked when officers arrested Voynov at the hospital. 

'I don’t think it occurred to them,' Walsh told reporters

He said that his client does not speak English and was not able to communicate properly with the police.

'Police asked her when she was leaving the hospital, ‘Did you want us to keep him away?’ ” Walsh said. '(She responded) ‘No, I want my husband back with me.’ It was not long before they were back together and spending time with their daughter.'
