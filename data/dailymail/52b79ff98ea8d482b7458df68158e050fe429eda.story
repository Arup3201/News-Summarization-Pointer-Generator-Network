Two swans had to seek human help after becoming entangled by their necks during an elaborate mating ritual.

Footage shows the animals desperately struggling to separate themselves from one another as they swim towards the shore.

But fortunately for the swans, two friends were on hand to help the distressed duo and free them from their predicament. 

Entangled: The two swans swam towards shore after being caught up in one another's necks

Help: Luckily, Alexander Nor was on hand to help the distressed animals and picked them apart

Alexander Nor came to the rescue of the two animals as he walked along the riverbank with friends near his hometown of Kremenchuk, Ukraine.

He said he spotted the birds awkwardly paddling because of their knotted necks, and added: 'They saw people, swam over and meekly waited to be disentangled.'

The video reveals the swans patiently waiting to be helped as Mr Nor delicately unravels their necks by twisting and turning them.

The animals show no signs of distress as they are helped from their mix-up and appear relieved to be freed as they run off squawking.

Mr Nor added: 'Sometimes I marvel at the minds of animals.'

Patient: The birds waited calmly as Mr Nor helped free the pair from their complicated relationship

Freedom: After his heroic act, Mr Nor said: 'Sometimes I marvel at the minds of animals.'

Swans usually tend to mate for life, although there have been cases recorded in the past where the animals have 'divorced' and returned from migration with different partners.   

Although considered as graceful animals, their 'courtship dance' is usually a lot more aggressive than imagined and can feature hissing and grunting sounds.
