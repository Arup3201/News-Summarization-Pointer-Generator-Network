The Houston Sheriff's office got a hand in busting local drug dealers last Friday thanks to a supplier with a poor memory for addresses.

Police arrested three individuals and seized narcotics with an estimated street value of $100,000 after a neighbor received a FedEx package of cocaine, heroin and meth and called police.

Sheriff Adrian Garcia said a resident from a quiet neighborhood in northwest Houston received a FedEx package that had been incorrectly addressed.

When they opened it, they found cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin, and tipped police anonymously through Harris County's mobile app, the Houston Chronicle reports.

When sheriff's deputies raided the intended address, they found an astonishing variety of drugs and weapons.

Among the narcotics found in the bust were marijuana,  cocaine, morphine, LSD, steroids, black tar heroin and codeine, as well as cancer medications police believe were stolen from a pharmacy.

The sheriff's office estimated that the street value of the seized narcotics was $100,000 and said they also found $6,700 in cash on hand in the home.

Police say they also seized an arsenal of shotguns, handguns and an AR-15 outfitted with a military-grade night scope, along with scales and baggies.

During the bust, police found one of the suspects, Stephanie Adams, 30, using meth while her 5-year-old daughter slept in the other room.

Adams and the other two suspects, Michael Taylor, 45, and Leslie Peck, 32, are being held on narcotics and weapons charges.

The Houston Sheriff's office said that the supplier who shipped the package is not yet in police custody.
