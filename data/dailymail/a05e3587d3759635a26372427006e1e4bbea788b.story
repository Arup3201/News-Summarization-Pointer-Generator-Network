A small Louisiana town is in shock and an unsuspecting mother is reeling after her 20-year-old son was revealed to be suspected child pornographer.

Sherrie Nixon of the little town of Quitman was caught completely off guard Monday when federal authorities arrested her son Chris Nixon just four hours after their Manhunt began.

‘It’s really hard for me to deal with this right now,’ said the weeping mother of an accused child predator.

Accused: Chris Nixon is charged with taping a sex act with a 6 to 10 year old using his cell phone. The 20-year-old Louisiana man's mother has been left emotionally devastated by the news

'I never expected this': A home in Quitman, Louisiana, where the accused pedophile's  mother wept and was nearly speechless when reporters arrived Tuesday

Chris Nixon was arrested after Homeland Security investigators quickly received 50 tips from concerned citizens identifying him as the pale, dark haired John Doe in the suspect’s photos.

‘I never expected this,’ Sherrie told a KNOE reporter as she shooed her from her home. ‘Just get my dog in the house and let me go lay down.'

Chris Nixon stands accused of sexually abusing prepubescent minor between 6 and 10 years old and taking video of the crime using a cell phone camera.

Nixon is accused of sexually abusing two victims in northern Louisiana. The 20-year-old was being held Wednesday as prosecutors sought to deny him bond. Meanwhile, neighbors who say they knew him well are nearly as shocked as the young man's mother

‘This is a person who we have video evidence has molested a child, and let's be very clear about what this is, this is child rape,’ Public Affairs Officer for the Department of Homeland Security Bryan Cox told KSLA.

Canadian authorities were first to discover videos online taken February 2012 and March of 2012 of at least two victims.

GPS coordinates embedded in the videos pointed to the Jonesboro area of Louisiana.

Authorities first used traditional investigative methods to try to find the suspect.

When that failed, they turned to the public for help, making a public plea and setting up a tip line.

In fewer than four hours, investigators had received 50 tips and had arrested Nixon at his home near Jonesboro.

Nixon made his first appearance in a Shreveport federal court on Tuesday and is expected back in court for a detention hearing on Thursday.

Meanwhile, neighbors of the suspect are nearly as taken aback as his mother.

'I'm shocked because we knew Chris, personally,' said neighbor Sheila Malone, who said Chris had spent some time with her son in the past.

'He even wanted to show Ashton his pet snake once. And we both went over to see the snake because Ashton is never unsupervised,' she said.

Shocked: Reporters were the first to inform neighbor Sheila Malone of the accusations, who said her son Ashton used to play with Chris sometimes. 'He even wanted to show Ashton his pet snake once. And we both went over to see the snake because Ashton is never unsupervised'
