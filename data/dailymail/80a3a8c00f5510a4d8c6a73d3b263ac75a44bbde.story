Laid back Australians have been ranked as the happiest people on earth for the fourth year running as measured by the OECD's Better Life Index.

The Paris-based economic organization's annual look at eleven categories of wealth, health, and other factors saw Oz take top marks in all but one.

Americans came in at a so-so number 7 out of the 36 nations analyzed, but they led the pack in one category that makes almost anyone feel happy: money.

Shining happy people: The Aussies are the world's happiest people according to the OECD's Better Life Index, which looks at 11 wellness categories and 36 countries worldwide

1. Australia2. Norway3. Sweden4. Denmark5. Canada6. Switzerland7. U.S.8. Finland9. Netherlands10. New Zealand

While the Aussies beat out everyone in most of the categories, they fell short in work-life balance despite a widespread reputation for being laid back beachy types.

Aussies' disposable income went up between between 2007 and 2011, notes the International Business Times, but that wasn't enough to overtake the United States.

Americans boast far and away the most disposable income per capita with $39,531 per year.

Trailing Australia overall were three Scandinavian nations, a region well-known for its world-leading well-being.

In number two comes Norway, which ranked highly in the jobs category of earnings, unemployment and job security.

In third were Norway's neighbors, the Swedes.

They outpaced the rest of the West in the environment category, which looks at air and water quality.

Behind the Swedes were the Danish, a people who have themselves been ranked the world's happiest by another little organization called the United Nations.

he bottom three countries in this year's Better Life Index were Greece at number 34, followed by Mexico (35) and the last place Turkey.

The survey was based on the responses of 60,000 people from around the world to questions about housing, income, jobs, community, education, environment, civic engagement, health, life satisfaction, safety and work-life balance.
