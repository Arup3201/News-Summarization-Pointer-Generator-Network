Jim Murphy has been elected leader of the Scottish Labour Party following a vote in Glasgow this morning. 

The MP for East Renfrewshire has elected with more than half the vote, ahead of Holyrood health spokesman Neil Findlay and former Scottish Executive minister Sarah Boyack.

The leadership contest was sparked when Johann Lamont stood down suddenly, accusing colleagues in Westminster of treating Scotland like a 'branch office'.

Kezia Dugdale, MP for the Lothian region, was also elected as the party's deputy leader.

Murphy will lead Labour's challenge north of the border during next year's general election  

Murphy, who was the favourite to win, became well-known for his soap box brand of pro-union patriotism during September's referendum on independence, which Scottish nationalists lost.  

An opinion poll in October showed the surge in support for
the SNP could leave Labour with just four of Scotland's 59 seats following the General Election, compared with the 41 they won in 2010.

Another one by YouGov published in The Sun today said the SNP were now on 47 per cent, while Labour is on 27. The Conservatives have 16 per cent of the electorate's support with the Liberal Democrats languishing on just three per cent.  

The referendum, in which Labour joined forces with David Cameron's
Conservatives in the fight to stop Scotland ending its 307-year
union with England, exposed the cracks in Labour's Scottish
stronghold.

Labour's failure was laid bare when it was left to former
Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, rather than the local party,
 to rally fellow Scots against independence. Brown, 63, who has announced he is stepping down at the next election.

Murphy was centre-stage during the referendum campaign, touring Scotland and giving speeches standing on his Irn-Bru crate.

He won this morning's election despite the trade union movement supporting former bricklayer Neil Findlay. 

Leader of the Scottish National Party and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Murphy and Ms Dugdale's election. 

She said: 'I know that the challenges of leadership are never easy, so I offer my best wishes for the job they have ahead.

'While we will undoubtedly cross swords often in the months ahead, my door is always open to those who wish to find common ground and work together in the best interests of people in Scotland – something I hope we will have the opportunity to do.'

Union Unite criticised today's decision to support Mr Murphy ahead of their preferred candidate.

Pat Rafferty, secretary of Unite Scotland said: 'Neil Findlay offered a genuine alternative to the politics and policies that led to consecutive electoral defeats for Scottish Labour and the haemorrhaging thousands of members. 

'Unite was proud to support Neil and his share of the vote is enough to show his popular policies have resonance among working people in Scotland.

'Arguably, Jim Murphy recognised this appetite for real change during the hustings, because as the campaign progressed his arguments became bolder on issues like taxation and a living wage. Jim now needs to turn words into action if he wants to start the process of re-building Scottish Labour.'

Speaking after his victory, Mr Murphy said: 'This is a fresh start for Scottish Labour. A new generation is in charge. But it’s only the beginning.' 

He said: 'Inequality is wrong. And Scottish Labour's mission is to end it.

'It makes me angry that kids from poor backgrounds are three times less likely to get good grades than those from prosperous backgrounds.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband congratulated Mr Murphy and his new deputy leader.

'Jim showed in the referendum campaign that he is a fighter. He showed in the leadership campaign that he is a leader. I am going to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Jim in the campaign to get David Cameron out at the General Election.

'Jim has already shown how he will use increased powers for the Scottish Parliament for a new 50p top income tax rate for people earning more than £150,000.

'Together we will show how a Labour government can change the lives of working people in Scotland.

'The fight to get the Tories out is now on. It is a fight we intend to win.'
