Wayne Elphick, 43, peddled cocaine using his disabled mother's taxpayer-funded Motability car

A drug dealer who peddled cocaine using his disabled mother's taxpayer-funded Motability car has been jailed.

Wayne Elphick, 43, cruised the streets looking for clients in the specially adapted Seat Leon – which was bought with a government grant to help his 64-year-old mother Patricia get around.

Police stopped him near his home in Moston, Manchester, in October last year and discovered £550 worth of cocaine hidden in his underpants. They also found £272 in cash.

Officers subsequently raided the house Elphick shared with his mother and found £900 worth of cocaine, scales, a drug debtors list and £290 in cash.

Elphick admitted cocaine possession with intent to supply and was jailed for two-and-a-half years. He had initially claimed the drug was for personal use, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Buckthorpe, of Greater Manchester Police, said Elphick: 'This conviction shows that GMP will absolutely not tolerate drug dealing in our communities.

'Elphick used a car purchased with a government grant to deal cocaine around the Greater Manchester area, thumbing his nose at both the law and the good faith in which that car was provided to help his ailing mother.

'This case falls part of Operation Challenger Cairo, which is a proactive investigation aimed at tackling organised crime groups, specifically those involved in the sale and supply of drugs.

'Drugs can have a devastating impact on people's lives, not just the users but their families. 

'I would ask anyone who has information into where drugs are being dealt or produced, to contact police.'
