She has a stellar acting career, numerous beauty and fashion campaigns under her belt and one of the hottest husbands in showbiz - but Blake Lively isn't resting on her laurels. 

The actress, who found fame as Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, has revealed plans to leave acting behind to launch a lifestyle site.

While details of her project remain vague, the 26-year-old gave a few hints in a recent interview with The Cut.

Welcome to my world: Blake Lively, who found fame on Gossip Girl, is getting set to launch a new lifestyle and foodie site

She said: 'I’m creating a brand that I felt the need for. I was on my show [Gossip Girl] for so long that I really wanted to break from acting, because it lost its excitement for me in a way, because it was such a job.

'I never lost my appreciation for [acting], though. I just felt like I didn’t have as much to offer because I got used to it. I wanted to explore other passions.

'I’m still being very vague, intentionally. But I’m really, really excited. By the time it launches, we will have developed it for two years. So it’s a lot of time, energy, efforts, resources, working with amazing people.'

The star, who is married to Ryan Reynolds, added that she was unsure if it was a 'lifestyle' site as such but promised there would be lots of foodie tidbits.

Inspiration? While Blake is remaining coy over what exactly her site will entail, it could well be similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop

It sounds similar in style to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop - a weekly lifestyle newsletter which she launched in 2008 that encourages readers to 'nourish the inner aspect'.

Each week, the newsletter focuses on an action: Make, Go, Get, Do, Be, and See and includes health tips, yoga news and Christmas gift ideas.

And talking of presents, Blake 
recently revealed what her dream present from her hunky spouse would be: she has her eye on a
 pair of circular Van Cleef & Arpels earrings...

Blake said: 'Their 
estate pieces are incredible, because they show how timeless Van Cleef 
is.'

But Blake added: 'There will also be the bankruptcy commercials for us [if we got them]!'

Ryan's gift ideas are slightly less expensive: the BOSS Bottled ambassador told us that his top ideas for the festive season are a mix CD and a bonsai tree.
