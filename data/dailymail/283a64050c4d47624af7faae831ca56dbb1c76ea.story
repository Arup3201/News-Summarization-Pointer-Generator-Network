US captain Tom Watson has appointed PGA Tour veteran Steve Stricker as a vice-captain for the 2014 Ryder Cup against holders Europe at Gleneagles in Scotland.

Stricker, 47, will join Andy North and Raymond Floyd as an assistant, though Watson pointed out that he could qualify for the team as a player if he wins this week's PGA Championship at Valhalla.

With just this week's event remaining before the top nine on the US Cup standings earn automatic selection for Gleneagles, Stricker languishes in 38th spot after playing the PGA Tour on a part-time basis over the last two years.

Call-up: Steve Stricker has been named as Tom Watson's third US vice-captain for the 2014 Ryder Cup

In charge: US captain Tom Watson will look to regain the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in Scotland this year

'Steve has been on the Ryder Cup team three times, he's been on five Presidents Cup teams,' Watson told reporters at Valhalla on Wednesday on the eve of the PGA Championship.

'Steve, when I called you, it was a pretty simple response from you: "I'd love to be the vice-captain". I appreciate that very quick and simple response that you made.

'What Steve brings here is a great familiarity with the players who are on the Tour right now. He brings a great deal of understanding of who these players are and their capabilities.'

Hope: Stricker could still feature at the 2014 Ryder Cup as a player if he wins the US PGA Championship

Stricker, a 12-times winner on the PGA Tour who has represented his country at the last three Ryder Cups, described his appointment as 'pretty special' and 'a sign of the times'.

'I feel old,' the American smiled. 'It's a sign of the times, I guess, that you're moving on in your career.

'But it's rewarding, too, to get a call from Tom, and to be a part of Andy and Raymond; to be a part of the whole team is pretty special.

'It makes you feel like you've been out here for a while, but also the respect of Tom and these other guys to even think about having me on the team.'

Experienced: Stricker has won 12 times on the PGA Tour and has played in the last three US Ryder Cup teams
