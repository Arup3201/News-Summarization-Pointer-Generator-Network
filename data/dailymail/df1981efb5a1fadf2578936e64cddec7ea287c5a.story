Those who think all modern art is a load of rubbish are unlikely to change their opinion after seeing this latest exhibition by a new star of the creative world.

Artist Mark Roberts - AKA Markrobla - dresses dummies in everyday clothes before leaving them stuck in unusual places.

The prone figures are not meant to cause of alarm, instead Mr Roberts - who has been compared to famous graffiti artist Banksy - intends the installations to make a statement about how people share events through social media.

Stange: Artist Mark Roberts - AKA Markrobla - dresses dummies in everday clothes before leaving them stuck in unusual places

Pushing up the daises: The art installations are part of a series of works displayed around Cardiff and Wrexham

His 'installations' have been spotted around Cardiff and Wrexham and mostly include men apparently stuck head-first in litter bins.

There is also a man stuck in a muddy hole, one cross-legged in a shopping precinct and a black-clad figure on a hammock by a busy road.

But the 26-year-old, currently based in 
Wrexham, struggles to convey the deep meaning behind his latest project, entitled 'Down in the Dumps'.

Street art: Mark Roberts has been likened to Banksy, the world famous graffiti artist, for his street art which includes leaving lifeless bodies across Wales

Bizarre: Fake bodies have been cropping up in public around Walse as part of the Down in the Dumps art project by Mark Roberts - AKA Markrobla

Talking point: Mark Roberts - AKA Markrobla - hopes to provoke thought from passers-by with his dressed dummies placed in public areas, be it sitting on a plinth, left, or burying their head in a flowerbed, right

He said: 'The project is a tricky one to answer as I have no 
end goal this is just what I do, I create.

'If it's a painting or 
sculpture, I do as much as I can.

'I suppose each sculpture has its own story and meaning behind it.

'The
sculptures that are meant to look like real people are created to amuse
and intrigue the public, and in this world of camera phones and social 
media I know they will be shared and spread.

He added: 'I'm inspired by everything around me: art, music, life in general all go into the big mixing bowl in my brain.

'The
process of taking the pictures is: usually once it's up to get the best
angle, as sometimes the wrong angle doesn't give the feeling of a 
living person, the tape holding it all together has to be covered or it 
ruins the illusion.'

Inspiration: Mr Roberts, pictured left, said he took inspiration for his 'Down in the Dumps' installations, right, from 'everything around me: art, music, life in general all go into the big mixing bowl in my brain'

Hanging around: Artist Mark Roberts - AKA Markrobla - here puts one of his dummies in a hammock strung between two trees
