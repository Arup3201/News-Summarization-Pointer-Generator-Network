A mother has spoken of the helplessness and pain she felt watching her 10-year-old daughter's struggle with anorexia after school bullies called her fat.  

Maxine Moss, 34, watched in horror as Jade's weight plummeted to a just 2st 13lbs - the same as an average four-year-old.

Despite the warning signs, doctors labelled Jade, now 12, a 'picky eater'.

Ms Moss, of Cannock, Staffordshire, said: 'I knew the signs because I'd suffered from anorexia as a child. I begged the doctors for help, but they maintained that Jade was too young to have an eating disorder.

Helpless: Maxine Moss, 34, watched in horror as Jade's weight plummeted to a just 2st 13lbs - the same as an average four-year-old, after suffering from anorexia brought on by cruel taunts from classmates

The youngster's problems began in June 2012, after school bullies branded her 'fat' and 'ugly'.

Upset, Jade began to feel body conscious and started to restrict her diet, secretly throwing food away.

The mother-of-ten noticed her daughter's lack of appetite and spoke to Jade, who confided about her troubles at school.

Ms Moss complained to teachers, who reprimanded the bullies with a verbal warning.

She said: 'I told Jade not to listen to the bullies, but it was no use.'

Jade continued to restrict her food intake and by September 2012, Maxine was forced to take her to the GP.

Jade said: 'I knew I was getting skinny, but no matter how small I got, I still believed I was fat'

But the doctor suggested Jade's lack of appetite was due to her being a 'picky eater'.

A week later, she noticed Jade checking the calorie content on food packaging.

Jade said: 'I knew I was getting skinny, but no matter how small I got, I still believed I was fat.

'When I brushed my hair, clumps would fall on to the carpet, and my skin was becoming flaky too.'

Jade then started skipping dinner, claiming she'd already eaten at a friend's house.

Ms Moss said: 'Jade now weighs a healthy five stone, but she missed months of school, and it's been difficult to catch up'

At school, she was secretly throwing her lunch away, surviving on just a nibble of a biscuit.

Ms Moss said: 'Even treats wouldn't tempt her.

'While her brothers and sisters ate chocolate cake for dessert, Jade would only manage an ice lolly.

'With nine children at home, it was tough to keep track of Jade's eating habits.

'I couldn't force her to eat and the doctors would do nothing. I felt helpless.'

By October 2012, Jade's weight had dropped from 4st 7lbs to less than 3st, leaving her severely dehydrated and suffering liver and kidney failure.

She struggled to walk, her face was gaunt and her clothes hung limply from her frail body.

Her breathing was shallow and she felt faint all the time.

Shockingly, Maxine could feel Jade's bones after checking her chest when she complained of pains.

It was the last straw and the youngster was admitted to Stafford Hospital, where she was diagnosed with anorexia.

With a BMI of just 9, Jade was dangerously underweight.

She was assigned a dietician, who encouraged her to eat small mouthfuls of food.

But after ten days of refusing to eat, Jade was still severely dehydrated and her organs were failing, so she was fed through a tube.

Jade said: 'The doctors told mum that I was in danger of dying if I didn't eat something.'

While ex-husband Graham, 41, looked after Jade's brothers and sisters, Thomas, 18, Callum, 13, Graham, 11, Calvin, 7, Ellie-Mae, 6, Summer, 4, Ocean, 3, Alex, 2, Maxine stayed by Jade's bedside.

Ms Moss begged Jade to eat and even sneaked in Jade's favourite takeaway, crispy chicken and egg fried rice to encourage her.

After 11 weeks, Jade started to eat small meals.

'The first time she swallowed a piece of crispy chicken I wanted to cry - there was a chance my little girl would make it, she said'

Jade's appetite slowly began to improve and she returned home in December 2012 weighing 3st 7lbs.

For the next six months, she received home visits from nurses, who checked her weight and progress, as well as counselling sessions, which she continues to receive to this day.

In January 2013 - seven months after she dropped out - Jade went back to school, but, too weak to walk, she relied on a wheelchair to get around.

She could only manage small meals, so relied on her feeding tube and protein shakes for nutrition.

Finally, in February 2013, Jade's feeding tube was removed.

Ms Moss said: 'Jade now weighs a healthy five stone, but she missed months of school, and it's been difficult to catch up.

'It's taken us a year and a half to get here, but I'm so pleased to see my little girl smile again.

'I want other mums to know that no matter how young the child, an eating disorder can still take hold, even if they don't fully understand it themselves.'
