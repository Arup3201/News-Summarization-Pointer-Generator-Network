The terrifying power of sharks has been revealed in a stunning video where a great white attacks a robotic vehicle.

The Remus SharkCam was deployed off Mexico’s Guadalupe Island to film the predators in the wild.

But the researchers hadn’t banked on a shark feeling threatened by an intruder in its territory - and were stunned when on-board cameras recorded a formidable encounter.

The robotic vehicle was being operated by a research team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).

A surge in shark attacks around the Hawaii Island of Maui hasn’t stopped surfers getting into the water.

Instead, locals are placing their trust in technologies that claim to keep the predators away by sending an electric pulse through the water.

One particular device, known as the Electronic Shark Defence System (ESDS), has enjoyed massive popularity on the island.

‘They just cannot make these things fast enough,’ said Hawaiian Island Surf and Sport owner Dennis O'Donnell, who keeps a waiting list for the products and sells out as soon as he's restocked.

Users strap the devices to their ankles, wetsuits or surfboards. Some are about the size of an oversized watch, others the size of a wallet. They range in price from £249 ($399) to £390 ($649). 

The cylinder-shaped vehicle has six cameras facing in all directions to provide a panoramic view of its environment.

It uses special acoustic tags to follow objects or animals in its vicinity. 

‘But the hunter soon became the hunted,’ the video explains.

Remus was approached by a great white shark, which soon swam into it at high speed and began biting the vehicle.

During its attempt to eat the vehicle the shark closes a flap of skin over its eye known as the nictitating membrane to prevent any damage from flailing prey.

Once it realises the vehicle isn’t food, however, it then merely considers it a threat.

It begins swimming past and ramming the vehicle, showing clear signs of a creature exhibiting territorial behaviour.

It lurks in the darkness before swimming up and attacking.

The researchers were surprised when the vehicle was pulled back out of the water only to find teeth marks all over it.

As one expert explains in the video, causing such damage would have required a great force.

‘If you banged on it with a screwdriver you wouldn’t get the same amount of damage’ he said.

It’s hoped the footage will help reveal details about shark strategies in hunting and interacting.
