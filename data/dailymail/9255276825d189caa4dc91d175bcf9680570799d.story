A California junior high school teacher was arrested Friday on charges she sexually molested at least two boys inside a school classroom.

Police were called to Nicolas Junior High School in Fullerton after two male students reported inappropriate conduct on the part of 28-year-old Melissa Lindgren.

The eighth grade teacher admitted her crimes to police, who booked her on felony charges of child molestation, child annoyance and the dissemination of harmful matter to a minor for allegedly sending the boys nude photos.

Charged: 28-year-old Fullerton, California junior high school teacher Melissa Lindgren is charged with felony counts of chjild molestation, child annoyance and dissemination of harmful matter to a minor

Lindgren was arrested within a few short hours after the boys, who officials have called ‘brave,’ first went to a school counselor with their allegations, according to the LA Times.

A source told KTLA that the encounters occurred inside the school in Lindgren's classroom.

How many students Lindgren had inappropriate contact with remained unclear as school officials scrambled to better understand the situation while putting concerned parents at ease.

‘I believe that it was more than a single incident. I do think it was over some period of time,’ District Superintendent Bob Pletka told CBS Los Angeles. ‘Ultimately, we will pursue termination, and it is an administrative law judge who makes that decision. But she will not be teaching with our kids at our district.’

In the school: Lindgren had taught at Nicholas Junior High School for six years and has been placed on administrative leave. According to sources of KTLA's, the alleged sexual encounters occurred inside the school classroom

Lindgren has taught at Nicolas Junior High for six years. She has now been placed on administrative leave.

In a statement, the school district vowed to do ‘everything within its power’ to ‘uphold a higher standard. Nothing less is acceptable.’

They called concerned parents and community members to the school Monday evening to address ‘any and all concerns.’

Lindgren was booked and later released after making $100,000 bail.

Lindgren’s arraignment was scheduled for April 9.
