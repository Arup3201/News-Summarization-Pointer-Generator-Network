With twenty five seconds left in the oppressive heat of Manaus, the world's greatest player finally made his mark on the world's greatest stage.

Trailing 2-1 to Jurgen Klinsmann's USA having played dreadfully once again, Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal were facing a World Cup humiliation to put in the same bracket as England's.

But after USA midfielder Michael Bradley — who had played brilliantly — lost possession in the centre circle in the 95th minute, Ronaldo broke down the right to deliver a sensational cross that allowed substitute Silvestre Varela to head powerfully past Tim Howard at the far post.

In an instant American hearts broke wide open. Now, instead of going to Recife to scrap with Germany for top spot on Thursday, they know this group is once again wide open. Portugal will have to improve against Ghana but at least they remain alive.

When Jermaine Jones and Clint Dempsey scored deserved second-half goals to wipe out an advantage given to Portugal by Nani after just five minutes, there seemed no way back on a night when even Ronaldo, for the large part, failed to lift a bunch of rather average players.

Great players only need a few seconds to change things, though, and Portugal move forwards now knowing that with Ronaldo in their team just about anything really is possible.

Given the traumatic nature of their opening defeat by Germany, the night couldn’t have started any better for Portugal.

The USA were still finding their feet in the opening moments when their Stoke City defender Geoff Cameron got himself in a muddle as he attempted to clear what was a pretty routine cross from Miguel Veloso on the left.

When he failed to deal with the threat and presented the ball straight to Nani at the far post, the Manchester United winger had time to control it, steady himself and plant the ball high above Howard, who had gone to ground early, from only six or seven yards.

The Portuguese — needing a victory so badly — could hardly believe their luck but it was peculiar how poorly they went on to play for the rest of the half. Certainly the United States could have equalised and probably should have done.

Right-back Fabian Johnson was finding it easy to get forward and he had a shot blocked after cutting inside soon after Nani’s goal.

Then Dempsey curled a free-kick over before the former Fulham forward was played in by Michael Bradley only to see Portugal keeper Beto save with his legs.

Bradley, Johnson and Dempsey were all to threaten again before the half hour from various distances as Portugal found themselves unable to keep possession for any length of time.

Ronaldo did present Nani with a chance with a pass to his right in the 42nd minute only for Howard to save the low drive from the edge of the penalty area. Then Howard somehow fumbled another Nani shot on to his lefthand post before saving Eder’s follow-up superbly with a scoop of his left hand.

It was at the other end where the greatest talking point lay, though, as America came within a whisker of equalising.

Johnson was continuing to terrorise Portugal with his raids down the right and moments after Beto saved his cross shot at the near post he raced to the byline again to pull the ball back perfectly in to  Bradley’s stride. The USA midfielder looked certain to score but somehow Portugal defender Ricardo Costa managed to deflect the close-range shot over the bar with his knee cap.

One wondered if Klinsmann’s team would live to regret that miss but with 25 minutes left they were back in the game.

Moments after Ronaldo had broken to slash a shot wildly off target, America forced a corner and when it was cleared to the edge of the box, Nani could only nod the ball in to the path of Jones 20 yards or so out.

The Besiktas midfielder took one touch to control it, another to shift it out of his feet and one more to curl a powerful shot into the corner with his right foot. It was a superb shot and USA had the parity their football deserved at that point.

Briefly Portugal — aware that their cause was desperate — tried to rally and Nani curled a good shot from 18 yards.

But the plain truth was that USA were better and they broke to take the lead with nine minutes left.

Again Johnson supplied the cross from the right and when Portugal couldn’t clear, Bradley’s scuffed effort screwed wide to Graham Zusi and his cross shot was nudged in by Dempsey with his midriff.

At this stage it looked all over for Portugal and Ronaldo. We should have known better to believe that.
