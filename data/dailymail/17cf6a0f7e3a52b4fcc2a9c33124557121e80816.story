This is the moment a father-of-two emerged from a horrifying ski crash covered in blood.

John Dowling, 58, ploughed into a metal gate while going down a closed piste Les Deux Alpes, in south-east France, with his son Rob.

He was left unconscious, covered in blood and needing more than 50 stitches. But three days later he was back on the slopes.

Mr Dowling, from Oxford, and his son, 
from Horsham, West Sussex, had tried to race down the slope, which was 
being prepared for an event the following day.

But
 when Rob cut his father up, Mr Dowling took a tumble. He careered into 
the gate and was left with a 3in gash across his forehead.

Mr Dowling had to be airlifted to hospital where he was treated for three days before being released.

The incident was caught on camera by Rob, who was wearing a GoPro headcam.

The 23-year-old, who works in marketing, said: 'I decided to race him down a closed ski slope that was being prepared for a race the following day.

He was moved away from the metal gate he crashed into and lay on the floor waiting to be airlifted to hospital

The father-of-two was then airlifted to hospital where he spent three days

'It was sunny and we had just had a fresh covering of snow so the conditions were good but as we were going down I cut across him and he went head first into a metal gate.

'As soon as he crashed I knew he was in trouble.

'There was blood everywhere and he was making very disturbing noises. At first his windpipe was half blocked by the metal gate he was on and he couldn't breathe so I had to move him.

The incident happened at the popular Les Deux Alpes ski resort in south-east France

'My first reaction was panic and guilt because I knew it was my fault. I had no idea of the extent of the damage, I didn't know if he was dying or not, it was genuinely terrifying.

'He got flow to hospital for three days and he had a lot of stitches to his head, I think it was more than 50. Three days later he was back skiing again.

'There was no lasting damage and he's been skiing again and just as fast.

'When I saw what happened to Michael Schumacher it was alarmingly close to home, that could have been my father.'
