Workers at a train company expected to ferry thousands of spectators to Olympic sailing events are to take industrial action during the Games in a row over pay.

The announcement from South West trains comes just days after the company's director urged spectators travelling to sailing events in Weymouth not to use their services and go by car instead.

Up to 1,000 train drivers and other staff at South West Trains will now work to rule and have backed a ban on overtime starting on Friday.

The industrial action - which is due to end on August 12, the last day of the Olympics - is expected to cause travel chaos as thousands of visitors flock to the Dorset coast.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union rejected the option of an outright strike but voted instead for different forms of action which may lead to significant disruption.

The managing director of the company Tim Shoveller said he was upset by the planned industrial action.

'It is disappointing the RMT seems 
intent on trying to disrupt services at such an important time for our 
customers and the country,' he said.

'Their attempts to renege on the deal
they agreed have gone down badly with the public and RMT members also 
voted against strike action over this issue.

'Despite
the RMT action announced today, we can confirm we will be running a 
full service for our passengers during the Games so they can get to and 
from the London 2012 events.

'We’re pleased that most of our employees have voted against taking a strike during the Games.

'This means we can deliver our full Olympic train service and ensure our passengers can enjoy the excitement of London 2012, a once in a lifetime experience.

'As we have said all along, the RMT agreed to a generous pay deal some months ago, which covered the period of the London 2012 Games'

But Mr Shoveller earlier warned power supply issues would mean that the company would be operating diesel services.

'Because of the power supply problem...the park-and-ride is the primary way people are being advised to get to Weymouth for the sailing,' he told the BBC.

RMT general secretary Bob Crow, said: 'Although we have secured good deals on Olympics recognition and reward for the vast majority of our members, we still have a small number of employers holding out and refusing to offer a fair deal.

'We cannot accept that blatant 
unfairness and the time has come for these employers to seize the 
opportunity, get round the table and sign off agreements that recognise 
the additional work and pressures that these staff will be carrying.'

Up
to 80,000 extra passengers every day are expected to use the South West
train network during the Olympics, as gold medal hopefuls including 
three-times Olympic winner Ben Ainslie take part in the sailing 
competitions in Weymouth.

There were severe delays today on one of the key Tube lines that will ferry people to the Olympics.

The problem was at North Greenwich close to the Olympic site at Stratford.

It meant long hold ups on the Jubilee line in the early part of the morning rush hour.

The delays also affected passengers on the London Overground - another key Olympic route.

Drivers coming into London today also experienced delays of up to 90 minutes.

A lane restriction on the A40 at Hanger Lane in west London caused backlogs on the M40.

The lane alterations are part of the preparation for the full introduction on Wednesday of the Olympic traffic-only Games Lanes in London.

The 30 miles of lanes are part of the 109-mile Olympic Route Network designed to allow athletes and officials to travel around the capital.

Despite Mr Shoveller's assurances, however, meltdown could occur if a larger number of spectators than anticipated decide to travel by public transport to the south west.

Almost £100m has gone towards improving roads in the area close to Weymouth, but the railway network - which for part of the route still has a single track - has received no new investment.

As well as contending with difficulties getting to the pretty seaside town, spectators may also struggle to put their feet up when they do arrive in Weymouth - due to a ban on folding chairs.

Weymouth's Nothe Gardens are an ideal vantage point to see the sailing out in the bay and has a steep bank where spectators will sit, but officials have banned chairs there because of safety fears.

A London 2012 spokesman said: 'For health and safety reasons fold-up chairs are not permitted in the Nothe Gardens which is an exposed and steeply banked site.

'We were clear about the site specifications at the point of sale, however, we will have limited fixed seating available for those that most require it.'
