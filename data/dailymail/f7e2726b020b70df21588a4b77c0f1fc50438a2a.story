This is the moment hundreds of mourners turned out to pay their respects to a war hero after it was feared no one would attend his funeral when he died aged 90 with no close relatives.

Sidney Marshall, who was an RAF gunner on a Lancaster bomber and flew 28 missions including a bombing raid on D-Day, died at his home in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire on June 16.

However, as his wife Elizabeth died last year and no other relatives were living nearby, his undertaker feared no one would to attend his funeral prompting him to launch an emotional appeal.

The appeal by Eddie Jacobs last month appeared in newspapers and spread to social media and today hundreds of people answered the call to join his remaining family for the funeral service at Lytham Park Crematorium, near Blackpool.

Applause rang out as the funeral cortege arrived with Mr Marshall’s coffin draped in the distinctive blue RAF Ensign flag and his cap on top, carried into the chapel to the Airman’s Hymn.

Mr Marshall, a flight sergeant during the Second World War, was one of nine brothers and sisters from Newcastle upon Tyne who grew up during the Great Depression of the 20s and 30s.

One of his brother’s Bill, 85, from Doncaster, who also served in the RAF, gave the eulogy for his elder brother - a ‘private’ man, he said, who rarely talked of his wartime exploits.

He said his brother worked at the Empire Bacon Factory until it was bombed out during the war, when he joined the RAF.

To laughter from mourners packing the chapel, he added: ‘I like to think years later he got his own back when he bombed one of their sausage factories.’

He also said his brother took part in the sinking of the giant German battleship Tirpitz and a raid on Hitler’s mountain lair Berchtesgaden, adding: ‘But he was not at home at the time.’

Mr Marshall, who flew 28 sorties as a mid-upper gunner including long flights over enemy territory to attack heavily-defended targets, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM) for his bravery before his death

The Rev David Phillips asked mourners to pray for the soul of Mr Marshall and to thank him ‘for all he did for us’.

After the hymns I Vow To Thee My Country and Jerusalem were sung, the Last Post was played and the Ode of Remembrance recited.

After the service, Mr Marshall said: ‘I think he (Sidney) would have been flabbergasted. We just expected a few RAF here.

‘We didn’t expect half of Blackpool to turn up.

‘It has been unbelievable, we even got a bunch of flowers from America - we don’t know who sent them.’

His son Trevor Marshall, 52, from Doncaster, also attended his uncle’s funeral.

He said: ‘It’s a bit overwhelming for us as a family but nice that people have come out and shown their respects.’

Mr Marshall, who flew 28 sorties as a 
mid-upper gunner including long flights over enemy territory to attack 
heavily-defended targets, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal 
(DFM) for his bravery before his death.

On a daylight attack on Bergen on January 12 1945, re-crossing the Norwegian coast, his aircraft was attacked by five FW190s.

The attack lasted 32 minutes and the Lancaster’s starboard outer engine was hit and left smoking and his gun turret was also in flames.

Mr Marshall’s DFM citation said there was ‘no doubt’ that the flight sergeant’s ‘coolness and skill greatly contributed to the saving of the aircraft’.

On another occasion, over occupied France on the night of July 4 1944, he brought down an Me110 attacking his Lancaster.

Paying tribute to the RAF serviceman, Mr Jacobs described him as a ‘smashing bloke’ and said his funeral turnout was ‘amazing’.

He said: ‘The turn-out was absolutely brilliant, there was between 600 and 700 people there which is amazing considering how wet it was. They were all there to celebrate a wonderful life.

After the service, brother Bill Marshall said: 'I think he (Sidney) would have been flabbergasted. We just expected a few RAF here. We didn¿t expect half of Blackpool to turn up'

‘We gave him a great send off, there 
were lots of soldiers there, including men currently serving in Sid’s 
old RAF Marhan - Nine Squadron.

‘Sid
 would actually have been embarrassed by the funeral. He was a quiet and
 private man, he didn’t want any flowers, just his hat and his medals.

‘But he would have been pleasantly embarrassed. He was a smashing bloke.’

The service was the second time Mr Jacobs has called for mourners to attend a war hero’s funeral.

In November the undertaker, of Roland L. Whitehead and Daughter Funeral Directors, organised a send-off for World War II veteran Harold Jellicoe Percival.

Dozens left floral tributes for the war hero who passed away in June just over a year after wife Elizabeth died

Mr Percival, who also lived in Lytham St Annes, was one of the last surviving Dambusters.

The service, which drew in more than 1,000 people, coincided with Armistace Day.

Mr Jacobs said: ‘It’s not really a cause I’m fighting, it’s just how it’s happened.

‘Any old soldier that has performed like that for his country deserves a bit of recognition.’
