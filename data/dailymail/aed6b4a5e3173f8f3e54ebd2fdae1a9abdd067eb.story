An Oklahoma history teacher faces losing his job for having a Benjamin Frankiln poster with a controversial quote based on 'choosing a mistress' on the wall of his classroom.

Steven Alcorn, 62, who has taught for 38 years, was suspended from Marlow High School last week for having a picture of a cat alongside the phrase: 'In the dark, all cats are grey.'

It is paraphrasing a letter the Founding Father wrote to a friend in 1745 called 'Advice to a Young Man on Choosing a Mistress' - urging a man he should chose an older woman companion.

Steven Alcorn was suspended from Marlow High School in Oklahoma last week for having a picture of a cat alongside the phrase 'In the dark, all cats are grey' in the classroom. It is a quote from a letter by Benjamin Franklin (right), written in 1745, advising a young man that he should choose an older mistress

In the passage, the politician writes: 'It is impossible of two women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the pleasure of corporal enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior.'

In the 19th century it was deemed obscene and was not originally published in his original letters. 

Alcorn, a Civil War reenactor, has been working at the school for six years and it is believed he had the poster up since he started.

Richard O'Carroll, the teacher's attorney, told the Duncan Banner: 'My client was teaching history accurately. 

'Just as Ben Franklin was a great man in terms of science and a founder of our nation, he was still a man. People need to know these things, not just the myths and legends, but who they are.

'We hope that cooler heads will prevail,' he added. 'There is still time for the school board to do nothing. If they do make a recommendation, we are looking forward to a full and fair hearing before the school board. We expect an exoneration.'

Career: The 62-year-old, who has been a teacher for almost 40 years, is believed to have had the poster in the classroom since he started at Marlow High six years ago 

Alcorn told the paper that he wanted to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and get back into the classroom. 

A Facebook group supporting his re-instatement has already reached 302 members and his wife Jera has also posted her support.  

Former student Amber Abrego told KFOR News 4 she never thought the quote was a big deal and thinks Alcorn's suspension is unfair.

'I think it`s awful, why would you want to do that to someone who has been so loyal to their school, who came to every single football game?

'I hope that he gets to keep his job. I hope that he gets more respect out of this because he deserves it. He`s a good man, he's a good teacher. 

However Brian Jacob, who works in a bait shop in the city, admitted he could see where the school is coming from.

Decision: Alcorn's disciplinary hearing at the school is set for January 20 when he will hear his fate. He says he hopes the issue will be resolved quickly so he can go back to work 

'Nowadays everything`s really touchy on subjects like that. Suspended? I can see it,' Jacob said.

The letter is taught in schools today because it was used in the 20th century to overturn U.S obscenity laws. 

It wasn't the only letter of Franklin's to be censored in the US. His satirical piece 'Fart Prouldy' was excluded from the majority of his published works.  

Attorneys used it to prove that if it had been mailed or published, one of the country's Founding Fathers would have been prosecuted. 

Education officials from Marlow Public Schools declined comment on Alcorn's case because it is a personnel issue and a pending legal matter. 

According to the Banner, Alcorn's disciplinary hearing has been set for January 20. 

The public school board is set to have already discussed the matter but have not released any details.

My dear Friend,

I know of no Medicine fit to diminish the violent natural Inclinations you mention; and if I did, I think I should not communicate it to you. Marriage is the proper Remedy. 

It is the most natural State of Man, and therefore the State in which you are most likely to find solid Happiness. Your Reasons against entering into it at present, appear to me not well-founded. 

The circumstantial Advantages you have in View by postponing it, are not only uncertain, but they are small in comparison with that of the Thing itself, the being married and settled. It is the Man and Woman united that make the compleat human Being. 

Separate, she wants his Force of Body and Strength of Reason; he, her Softness, Sensibility and acute Discernment. Together they are more likely to succeed in the World. A single Man has not nearly the Value he would have in that State of Union. He is an incomplete Animal. 

He resembles the odd Half of a Pair of Scissars. If you get a prudent healthy Wife, your Industry in your Profession, with her good Economy, will be a Fortune sufficient.

But if you will not take this Counsel, and persist in thinking a Commerce with the Sex inevitable, then I repeat my former Advice, that in all your Amours you should prefer old Women to young ones. You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:

i. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor'd with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.

2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.

3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc'd may be attended with much Inconvenience.

4. Because thro' more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin'd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.

5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding2 only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.

6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.

7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.

8thly and Lastly They are so grateful!!

Thus much for my Paradox. But still I advise you to marry directly; being sincerely Your affectionate Friend.
