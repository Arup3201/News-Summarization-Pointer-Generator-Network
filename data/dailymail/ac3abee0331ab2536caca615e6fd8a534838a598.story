Formula One legend Michael Schumacher is showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening', his manager has revealed.

After more than three months in a coma, the seven-time champion is 'making progress'.

He has opened his eyes and has had interaction with his environment, albeit in a minimal way so far.

New hope: Schumacher's manager has said the F1 driver has shown 'encouraging signs' of improvement

Schumacher, 45, suffered a near-fatal head injury in a skiing accident in Meribel, France, on December 29.

In
 the first positive news for months, his manager Sabine Kehm announced: 
'Michael is making progress on his way. He shows moments of 
consciousness and awakening. We are on his side during his long and 
difficult fight, together with the team of the hospital in Grenoble, and
 we keep remaining confident.'

She
 said no further details would be given out of respect to his family and
 to 'enable the medical team to work in full calmness'.

Gary Hartstein, a former Formula One doctor, said 'awakening' would mean that Schumacher has opened his eyes.

He
 said: 'This eye opening can even be cyclic, following what looks just 
like a sleep-wake cycle (even if not synchronised to real day-night 
hours).'

And he said the 'moments of consciousness' meant that Schumacher would have had interaction with his environment.

He
 said: 'It consists of episodes of clear, purposeful interaction with 
the environment, and/or clear signs of awareness of self, even if these 
signs are not constantly present.

'For
 example, if Michael smiles when a member of his entourage talks to him -
 reproducibly and consistently on at least a few occasions. Or following
 people with his eyes.

'Or trying to communicate, or obeying simple 
commands. Any of this constitutes objective signs of contact between the
 "outside" and the "inside". This then would be a minimally conscious 
state. And that is about the best news we could possibly get right now.'

But despite the encouraging signs, Schumacher will not be moved from Grenoble Hospital anytime soon.

His
 family and friends have also stressed there is no truth in wild rumours
 that his wife Corinna 'has built or plans to build any kind of medical 
suite for Michael on any of the buildings on their land in Gland, 
Switzerland. This includes future buildings'.

When doctors give the go-ahead he will be moved to a rehabilitation clinic, according to a family friend.

The friend said: 'There will be a very significant amount of rehab required.'

Doctors began the process of gradually awakening Schumacher from his coma more than nine weeks ago.

It
 will be 14 weeks ago on Sunday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his 
life-threatening accident while skiing in Meribel, where he owns a 
chalet.

Doctors began the process of gradually awakening him more than nine weeks ago.

Ms
 Kehm said it is 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the 
racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 
'banal situation'.

The accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off-piste area in the French resort of Meribel.

He
 was skiing with his 14-year-old son when he lost control after hitting a
 rock. He ended up smashing his head into a bolder 34 feet further down 
the mountain.

He is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive care in Grenoble University Hospital.

Corinna, with whom he has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside.

They have remained confident throughout the tragedy that Schumacher will recover.

A
 statement released last month said: 'We are and remain confident that 
Michael will pull through and will wake up. There sometimes are small, 
encouraging signs, but we also know that this is the time to be very 
patient.'

His manager has 
stood by this statement during the last few weeks amidst the negativity 
offered by certain doctors who have nothing to do with his treatment.

In February French investigators closed the official inquiry into his accident, ruling out any criminal wrongdoing.
