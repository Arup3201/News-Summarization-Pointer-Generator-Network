A would-be prankster died after he slipped out of the front seat after he opened the van door after telling his fellow passengers 'watch this.' 

Wayne Rowlands, 27, is believed to have fallen from the moving Ford Transit van, which was travelling at about 40mph, after slipping from the edge of his seat.

Seconds earlier the bricklayer and amateur footballer said to his friends 'watch this for a prank boys.' 

An inquest into his death heard that Mr Rowlands, of Llanrhyddlad, Anglesey, suffered a severe brain injury after rolling into the road. 

Wayne Rowlands, 27, is thought to have died after a prank gone wrong when he fell from a van travelling at around 40mph after he opened the door and said to friends 'watch this boys' as they drove through Anglesey 

Shaun Wharton told the hearing at Caernarfon, Gwynedd that Mr Rowlands was between tipsy and drunk.

He said: 'Everyone was taking the Mick out of each other. He said "watch this for a prank boys." He has opened the door. 

'I thought he was going to close the door. He has gone on the edge of the chair. I clenched the corner of his jacket. He exited the vehicle and rolled in the road.

'I said 'Oh my God he's jumped.'

Mr Wharton, who had been sitting between the driver and Mr Rowlands, said: 'It's like he slipped on the seat. I don't think he jumped out.'

Mr Rowlands was a keen footballer in the Anglesey area. He also was a manager of Bodedern FC

Robert Jones was driving the van and said he was doing about 40mph when Mr Rowlands fell as they drove to a pub at Rhosneigr, Anglesey. It happened on an unclassified country road between Bryngwran and Llanfaelog in April. 

Coroner Nicola Jones recorded a conclusion of accidental death.

She said Mr Rowlands was twice the drink-drive limit and had been in 'high-spirits, good humour and usual happy-go-lucky self' during a ten-minute journey.

The coroner said : 'It seems Wayne has slipped off the edge of the seat and fallen from the vehicle. It is too far-fetched to say this is a prank where Wayne jumped out of the vehicle. I don't think he was that drunk.

'I am satisfied, on the evidence of Mr Wharton, Wayne was just trying to wind his friends up. He's got to the edge of the seat and slipped away. The head striking the road caused the head injury.' 

Mr Rowlands was involved in football and manager of Bodedern FC, which told the Daily Post his death was a 'huge loss.'
