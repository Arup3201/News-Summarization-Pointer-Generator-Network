A man was almost cut in half during a rescue operation when a dozen people got trapped in a lift behind a brick wall in south China.

The group of people had found themselves stuck in a lift in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province when its doors opened to reveal a brick wall, the management's way of keeping people from entering the building from the car park.

One man managed to make a hole in the brick wall with a hammer, but as a young man begins to climb through, feet first, the lift moves.

Danger: A man is almost cut in half as he gets stuck  trying to escape a lift in Shenzhen, China

The group of 11 people found themselves trapped in a lift, and despite rescue workers arriving quickly on the scene to reassure them, the group can be seen visibly stressed on CCTV.

A maintenance worker who happened to have a hammer can be seen attacking the wall, causing the others in the lift to panic.

As soon as there is a small hole in the brick wall, one of the men begins to squeeze through.

As the hole is not big enough, the man becomes stuck just as rescue workers get ready to move the lift again.

Rescue worker Wang Long told local media: 'It was an extremely foolish thing to do, it was relatively easy to reactivate the lift and override the safety function to move into the next floor.'

'It was only by chance that we checked the CCTV cameras and realised the was a man stuck in the hole.' 

Fortunately, as the man was seen on camera by the rescue team, he managed to climb into the car park through the hole, and the lift can move again.

Mr Long adds: 'He could have been cut in half, we had told them not to panic by shouting down from above and they completely ignored us.'

The group of ten men and one woman had piled into the lift in the city of Shenzhen, but exceeded the weight limit.

The lifts automatic safety function kicked in and it automatically opened at the next floor to let people out.

Unfortunately for the 11 passengers in the lift, the next floor happened to be the basement where building managers had bricked the opening shut to stop unauthorised access to the property.

Building manager Cao Feng, 43, said: 'We wanted to make sure that only people who had come through the main entrance were allowed then to go to the property.

'We didn't want them coming up from the underground car park.'

He said they had thought it was easier to simply brick up the entrance rather than reprogramming the lift but had forgotten about the safety function that had delivered the unfortunate passengers to the car park where they faced the brick wall.
