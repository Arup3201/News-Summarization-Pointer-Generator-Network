A photograph of China's new first lady which briefly appeared on Chinese cyberspace this week has revealed a darker side to Peng Liyuan.

The picture shows Peng as a young woman in Beijing's Tiananmen 
Square serenading martial-law soldiers following the bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 1989.

It comes as the 50-year-old wife of China's new leader, Xi Jinping, grabbed positive global headlines for her stylish appearance.

Hit: Peng remains a popular figure in China, despite the picture of her emerging on the internet

The image was swiftly scrubbed from China's Internet before it could generate discussion online, but not before being seen and shared by outside observers.

It revived a memory the country's leadership prefers to suppress and shows one of the challenges of presenting Peng on the world stage as the softer side of China.

The picture showed Peng in a green military 
uniform, her windswept hair tied back in a ponytail as she sings to 
helmeted and rifle-bearing troops seated in rows. 

It followed the Tiananmen Square Massacre, which shocked the world when Chinese troops with guns and tanks attacked students who had occupied the square for weeks.

The picture contrasts with her appearances this week in trendy suits and 
coiffed hair, waving to her 
enthusiastic hosts while touring Russia and Africa with her husband.

The photo has circulated mainly on 
Twitter, which is blocked in China. The few posts on popular domestic 
microblogs did not evade censors for long.

Many young Chinese are unaware that 
on June 3 and 4, 1989, military troops crushed weeks-long pro-democracy 
demonstrations in Beijing with force, killing hundreds, possibly 
thousands, of people.

Those who do know about the assault 
tend to be understanding of Peng's obligations as a member of a 
performance troupe in the all-powerful People's Liberation Army. At the 
time, her husband Xi was party chief of an eastern city.

Peng, a major general in the People's Liberation Army and popular folk singer, has been in the military 
since age 18 and has fronted TV music videos featuring dancing lines of 
men with combat fatigues and weapons.

She also starred in a song-and-dance 
number in 2007 that has perky women in Tibetan garb sashaying behind her
 while she sings an ode to the army that invaded Tibet in 1959.

'Who is 
going to liberate us? It's the dear PLA!' go some of the lyrics. The 
video has provoked severe criticism from Tibetan rights groups.

Joseph Cheng, a political scientist at City University of Hong Kong, said: 'The photo probably has a negative 
impact more so internationally than domestically.'

He said more 
scrutiny of Peng is likely and such images could raise questions about 
Xi's interest in reforms.

Mr Cheng added: 'It has been several months now that 
Xi Jinping has assumed the top leadership role and certainly, we have 
found no indicator that he is interested in this stage to push serious 
political reform.'

Kelley Currie, a China human rights expert
 for the pro-democracy Project 2049 Institute in Arlington, Virginia, was unsurprised by the image.

She said: 'I think that we have a lot of people 
hoping that because Xi Jinping walks around without a tie on and his 
wife is a singer who travels with him on trips that maybe we're dealing 
with a new kind of leader, but I think these images remind people that 
this is the same party.

'It's using some new tools and new techniques, for the same purposes: to preserve its own power.'

The lifespan of Peng's Tiananmen 
image in the finicky world of the Chinese Internet has so far been 
short, and she remains a beloved household name with huge domestic 
popularity.

The image is a snapshot of the back 
cover of a 1989 issue of a publicly available military magazine, the PLA
 Pictorial, according to Sun Li, a Chinese reporter who said he had 
taken a photo of it on his cell phone several years ago when it was 
inadvertently posted on his microblog.

Sun said he quickly deleted it 
and had no idea how it resurfaced on the Internet years later.

Microblog users can easily save 
images and recirculate them even after the original posts have been 
deleted.

The picture spread further after it was tweeted by the 
U.S.-based China Digital Times, which tracks Chinese online media.

Chinese military 
historian Warren Sun, of Monash University, Australia, said he had little doubt 
about the authenticity of the image.

He cited a 1992 academic report as stating that after the crackdown Peng performed a song titled 'The Most 
Beloved People' in a salute to martial law troops.
