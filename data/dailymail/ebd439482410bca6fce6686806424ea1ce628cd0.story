Tragic: Hairdresser Veronica Galbraith, 37, was left devastated after being unable to cope with teenage son Andre's behavioural problems

A doting single mother is thought to have jumped to her death from a motorway bridge after being forced to put her autistic child into care, an inquest was told.

Hairdresser Veronica Galbraith, 37, was left devastated after being unable to cope with teenage son Andre's behavioural problems.

Miss Galbraith had also been cruelly taunted by neighbours who said: 'You have had your child taken off you, we have still got ours,' the inquest was told.Miss Galbraith was found dead on the M61 underneath a bridge near her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, last June.

It is believed she fell or jumped into the path of several lorries travelling along the carriageway. She died from multiple injuries.

She had tried to kill herself by overdosing on tablets twice before, the inquest was told.

The hearing in Bolton heard how the single mother had been a talented badminton and volleyball player at school before giving birth to Andre in 1997.

She had later split up with his father and moved into her family home in Bury Crescent, Walkden.

Miss Galbraith's mother Martha said in a statement: 'Andre had autism and was expelled from school. He smashed up the house and Veronica could not cope and put him in care.

'She was then having a lot of trouble from her next door neighbours who would play loud music. When she would go round to the house she would be threatened. She started saying she was hearing things and we knew she was not well. She started getting help.'

Miss Galbraith's boyfriend John Walls said: 'Andre had behavioural problems and was taken into care in May 2010. When Andre went into care I stayed with Veronica to help her.  Veronica went to see him but he was still a bit annoyed and he didn’t want to see anyone and he was still getting into trouble.

'There were quite a lot of arguments and problems with the neighbours. They were always playing loud music and she couldn’t sleep.'

Miss Galbraith's moved into a home for vulnerable women last April but she attempted suicide twice and was said to be 'crying all the time' after her brother died suddenly.

Mr Walls added: 'When her brother died she had a breakdown, she started talking about death saying she had cancer and was going to die. She did say that she did not want to live anymore and I said to think about Andre because he needed her and think of her mother. She did not say or give any specific reason why.

Sorrow: Miss Galbraith's boyfriend John Walls, who was at the Bolton inquest, said the 37-year-old had talked about 'jumping off a bridge' which he had dismissed it as 'silly talk'

'She was frustrated that she could not have Andre at home and that she could not control his behaviour, her world was upside down. I think that was the start of the problems, she started to drink heavily and became depressed.'

He added: 'In the past when she was ill she did mention, "I feel like going to the bridge. I feel like jumping off a bridge". I just thought it was silly talk.There was no texts, letters or nothing.'

Recording an open verdict, Bolton Deputy Coroner, Alan Walsh said: 'Veronica had had the problem of coping with the behaviour of an autistic child and that would have been distressing and hard for her due to his behaviour.

'He was in the care of the local authority and she maintained contact and saw him at least once a week. Clearly she still cares for him as his mother.

'She was distressed that he was in care and distressed about the death of her father and then subsequently the death of her brother and her sister being ill. In addition she was concerned for her mother and there is reference from the mental health service that Veronica believed her mother and sister may die which would be an additional worry to the deaths she had already had to cope with.'

He added: 'How she got onto the motorway cannot be certain. She could have got to the carriage way by jumping, falling, walking down the steps onto the hard shoulder and walking into the road.'
