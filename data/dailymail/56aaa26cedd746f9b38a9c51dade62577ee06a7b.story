Duran Duran are suing their own fan club for $40,000 (£23,500) over claims the club failed to pay them fees.

The band, best known for their 80s hits Hungry Like The Wolf and Girls On Film, have filed a lawsuit against a club based in Glenview, Illinois.

The suit, filed at Cook County Circuit Court, says that Worldwide Fan Clubs Inc entered into a contract with the band in 2010 agreeing to set up and run a fan club.

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the contract stated that the club would sell merchandise and collect membership fees, handing 75 per cent of profits over to the band.

Worldwide Fan Clubs Inc were also supposed to keep accurate accounting records and maintain fan club records.

The band's lawyers are claiming that the club failed to keep accounts properly and failed to hand over the agreed fees, and are now suing.

Duran Duran released their first single, Planet Earth, in 1981 and it went on to reach number 12 in the UK charts.

The same year they also released Girls On Film, one of their best-known records, which ended up reaching number five in the top 40 chart. They reached Number One in the UK in 1983 with 'Is There Something I should know' - the song also reach number Four in the U.S.

The 80s pop-rock group are best known for songs such as Girls On Film and Hungry Like The Wolf. They are thought to be working on a new album with John Frusciante, of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame

The group, which originally consisted of Roger Taylor, Simon le Bon, John Taylor, Andy Taylor and Nick Rhodes, have topped the chart on two occasions, once in 1983 with Is There Something I Should Know, and again in 1984 with The Reflex.

Their last album, All You Need Is Now, released on 21 March 2011 was well received critically but failed to live up to the chart-topping sales power of their previous efforts.

In a blog post on their official site, the band have confirmed that they are working on a new album which will include guitar work by John Frusciante, of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame.
