A search is underway for 13-year-old girl who has been missing for four days after getting into a strange man's car in Seattle, Washington.   

Eliana Perkins was last seen climbing into a white Honda driven by a man in his thirties on Martin Luther King Jr Way on Friday afternoon, police said.

Her relatives have reportedly been told by another child that the man is of Mexican descent, with 'a scar on his nose and black eyes'. The child was apparently warned by the man 'not to tell police'.

It is unclear whether the driver was known to Eliana. It is also unknown whether the other unidentified child was present at the time of Eliana's disappearance, or if they spoke to the man at a later point.
