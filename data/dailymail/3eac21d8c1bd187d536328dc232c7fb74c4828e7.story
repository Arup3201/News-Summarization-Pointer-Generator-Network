The last rites of Caterham are due to be read over the next few weeks via a number of auctions to sell off the team's equipment.

Caterham fell into administration towards the end of October after a dispute between the owners at the time and their predecessor in Tony Fernandes, the current chairman of Barclays Premier League team QPR.

A crowd-funding project helped Caterham on to the grid for the final race of last term in Abu Dhabi after they had missed the previous two events in the United States and Brazil.

Wyles Hardy & Co are selling off Caterham's items via auction over the next three months. Here, Sportsmail picks out three items that are up for sale:

Lot 18: 'Two 2011 Show Front Wheel Rims mounted with PIRELLI Wet Show Tyres' - Current bid, as of Monday afternoon: £200 (Bidding ends March 11, 10:14 GMT)

Lot 664: 'A Caterham F1 Fully Functioning Race Car Steering Wheel, as Raced in the 2014 Season' - Current bid, as of Monday afternoon: £1,800 (Bidding ends March 12, 12:16 GMT)

Lot 880: 'A Lotus Racing Formula 1 Full Racing Chassis Show Car' - Current bid, as of Monday afternoon: £22,500 (Bidding ends March 12, 15:32 GMT) 

However, despite then administrator Smith & Williamson doing all they could to put Caterham in the shop window, and conducting talks with numerous interested parties, no deal could be struck.

What remains of the team's assets are now due to be sold off via auctions over March, April and May, and conducted by Hertforshire-based Wyles Hardy & Co.

The first of the auctions - at the Caterham Sports Centre in Langley - runs for three days this week from Wednesday with the sale of race and pit lane equipment, 2014 chassis show cars, electronics workshop and test equipment.

Further auctions include the sale of memorabilia, team clothing, branded goods, archive car panels and components, show car, as well as IT and office equipment.

It represents a sad end for a team that entered F1 in 2010 with such high hopes and aspirations, only to endure countless problems along the way.
