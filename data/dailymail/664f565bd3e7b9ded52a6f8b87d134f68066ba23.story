President Obama thought he was taking a hard line when he issued sanctions against Russian officials following the Crimean vote to leave Ukraine.

But Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin thinks the sanctions are hilarious.

Rogozin was one of 11 Russian and Ukranian officials hit with economic sanctions today, and responded on Twitter calling whoever drafted the list a 'prankster'.

In his tweets, Rogozin asks 'Comrade @BarackObama' how the sanctions will affect him since he doesn't have 'accounts or property abroad'.

Vladislav Surkov, one of President Vladimir Putin's top aides, was also included on the list and just as ambivalent about his new restrictions.

'It's a big honor for me,' he told a Russian newspaper. 'I don't have accounts abroad. The only things that interest me in the U.S. are Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg, and Jackson Pollock. I don't need a visa to access their work. I lose nothing.'

Those included on the list will now not have access to any assets under American jurisdiction and American banks will not be able to do business with them.

Additionally, they will not be allowed to travel into the United States.

The sanctions were designed to dissuade President Vladimir Putin from annexing Crimea after the Ukranian region passed a vote to join Russia.

Those targeted in the sanctions were 'key ideologists and architects' of Russia's ploy to regain Crimea and some are even accused of curbing 'human rights and liberties' in their home country.

Mr Obama issued the sanctions to make it clear 'that there are consequences for their actions in Crimea.

He also warned that sanctions issued on Monday are not necessarily the end, stressing that the U.S. stands ready to impose further sanctions if necessary.

'Russiaâ€™s decision to send troops into Crimea has rightly drawn global condemnation,' President Obama said at a White House press conference Monday.

'As I told President Putin yesterday, the referendum in Crimea was a clear violation of Ukrainian constitutions and international law, and it will not be recognized by the international community.'

Obama said the government has the authority to go after officials in the Russian arms sector and those who support Russian cronies if the government doesn't pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine.

Obama on Monday froze the U.S. assets of seven Russian officials for their support of Crimea's vote to secede from Ukraine in the most comprehensive sanctions against Russia since the end of the Cold War.

The Treasury Department also is imposing sanctions on four Ukrainians involved in the separatist effort including former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

The White House accused Yanukovych as being the one to invite Putin's troops into Crimea after he fled Kiev and headed to Russia himself.

'Now, I believe thereâ€™s still a path to resolve this situation diplomatically in a way that addresses the interest of both Russia and Ukraine,' President Obama said.

Senior administration officials also said they are developing evidence against individuals in the arms industry and those they described as 'Russian government cronies' to target their assets.

The administration officials said Putin wasn't sanctioned despite his support of the Crimean referendum because the U.S. doesn't usually begin with heads of state.

But the officials, speaking to reporters on a conference call on the condition they not be quoted by name, say those sanctioned are very close to Putin and that the sanctions are 'designed to hit close to home.'

The U.S. announcement came shortly after the European Union announced travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people they have linked to the unrest in Crimea.

Obama administration officials say there is some overlap between the U.S. and European list, which wasn't immediately made public.

Biden was heading to Europe Monday and Obama plans to go next week. The president said that demonstrating a 'solemn commitment to our collective defense' as NATO allies will be at the top of the agenda.

The sanctions were expected after residents in Crimea voted overwhelmingly Sunday in favor of the split. Crimea's parliament on Monday declared the region an independent state.

The administration officials say there is some concrete evidence that some ballots for the referendum arrived pre-marked in many cities and 'there are massive anomalies in the vote.' The officials did not say what that evidence was.

The United States, European Union and others say the action violates the Ukrainian constitution and international law and took place in the strategic peninsula under duress of Russian military intervention.

Putin maintained that the vote was legal and consistent with the right of self-determination, according to the Kremlin.
