Proved wrong: Ed Miliband's entire election strategy hinges on the cost of living, which is now affordable, figures show

Ed Miliband faces a fresh crisis as his ‘cost of living card’ evaporates ahead of the election.

Figures out later this week are expected to show that pay rises are now outstripping inflation for the first time in six years.

This means Labour’s entire election strategy – to blame the Coalition for presiding over a ‘cost of living crisis’ – will effectively become redundant.

At the weekend Chancellor George Osborne used a speech in the US to crow that Labour were ‘wrong about the past and they are wrong about the future’.

And Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg used his monthly Press conference to lambast Labour for having created the squeeze on living standards  in the first place by ‘crashing’ the economy.

Mr Miliband faced further criticism yesterday from Alan Milburn, a former Labour health secretary, who called on the party to court business if it has any hope of winning the election.

Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Milburn said Labour needed to ‘embrace an avowedly pro-business agenda and match it with a more pro-business tone’.

Economic figures are expected to show that inflation has fallen from 1.7 per cent in February to 1.5 per cent in March; while growth in weekly earnings has risen from 1.4 per cent to 1.8 per cent.

If it is confirmed that wages are rising faster than the cost of living, this will mean Britons will feel like they have more money in their pockets – and will be less likely to listen to Labour’s warnings.

Mr Clegg said Labour had been proved wrong time and time again since the last election, and will have nothing left to say at the election if their ‘cost of living crisis’ line is proved wrong.

‘First they said making cuts and saving was not necessary – a remarkable thing to say when you had the largest peacetime deficit in this country ever and the largest structural deficit anywhere in the developed world,’ Mr Clegg said.

‘Then they said that by imposing savings, that was going to stop growth. Then they said that a million more people were going to be unemployed – every single one of those allegations by the Labour Party has fallen by the wayside and has proved to  be wrong.

It comes as Osborne told a US audience Labour was 'wrong about the past and is wrong about the future'

‘And if this latest suggestion from the Labour Party that somehow living standards  will somehow never improve again also proves to be wrong, what on earth does the  Labour Party have to say on the most central issue of the day – namely how we manage our economy, come May of next year.’

Mr Clegg said the reason why there had been a squeeze in living standards was  that Britain had ‘suffered the largest cardiac arrest in  our economy’ since the 1973 oil crisis.

‘I find it remarkable that in addition to denying any responsibility for the crash in the first place, they are denying any kind of maturity in accepting that you need to take difficult decisions to clean up the mess that was created by the Labour Party in the first place,’ he said.

‘The Labour Party have then gone on to somehow claim that the pressure on people’s living expenses had got nothing to do with them either.

‘I just think this consistent abdication of responsibility; this persistent refusal to apologise for having crashed the economy in the first place … shows a real paucity of credibility on the economy.

‘As people’s living standards improve and the pressure on living standards is eased, I wonder what is left for Labour.’
