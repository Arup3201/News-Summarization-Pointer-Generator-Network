It may be the most impractical and cumbersome iPhone case ever made, but one thing's for certain: you'd never lose your mobile again if it was encased in it.

The red lobster mobile phone case is inspired by Salvador Dali's iconic lobster telephone, (Aphrodisiac telephone), created by the artist in 1938.

The modern contraption's designer, Melbourne-based Elliot Gorham, says of his creation: 'Unlike the typical phone case, it doesn’t offer functionality of protection and style

The modern contraption's designer, Melbourne-based Elliot Gorham, says of his creation: 'Unlike the typical phone case, it doesn't offer functionality.

'Its features include; camera incapability, ergonomically awkward, too big for your pocket or handbag and most importantly, it’s ability to cause its users embarrassment.

'The phone case is a commentary on both the curious nature of the mobile phone case industry and of the modern dependency and or addiction to mobile technology.'

Gorham says that he and his collaborator Matthew Little had been discussing the concept of detaching yourself from technology, ad decided that the 'Lobster Mobile Telephone Case presents itself as a deterrent through its awkward and inoperative design, resulting in minimal enjoyment of function, zero fashion credibility and lastly, reduced mobility for the user'.
