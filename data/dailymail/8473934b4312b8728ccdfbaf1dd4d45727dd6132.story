Twenty-five men who claimed they were abused by former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky, have reached settlements with the university.

The university's lawyer revealed that 25 lawsuits had been settled out of the 31 that were filed against the former school's assistant football coach.

Among the victims to receive a settlement is the accused's adopted son, Matt Sandusky, who finalized a deal with Penn State lawyers on Friday.

A total of 25 of Jerry Sandusky's victims reached settlements with Penn State lawyers yesterday. The former assistant football coach (pictured) is serving 30 years in prison for sexual abuse

Matt
Sandusky had been expected to be a defense witness for his father until
the trial, when he told investigators that he also had been abused by 
Jerry Sandusky. He has since petitioned for a legal name change for 
himself and his family.

More than a dozen additional victims who had not come forward with their allegations during Sandusky's trial in June 2012 reached settlements yesterday, with the university paying out 'millions of dollars' to victims.

Jerry Sandusky was the longtime defensive coordinator at Penn State and ran a charity for underprivileged children in his spare time.

Prosecutors said Sandusky used the charity, The Second Mile to find and groom victims whom he would bring to Penn State football games and facilities, where he molested them.

He was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse and sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.

Philadelphia-based attorneys Joel Feller and Matt Casey represented seven of Sandusky's victims, including Matt Sandusky and three men who testified at the trial.

Victims who had not come forward with their allegations during Sandusky's trial in June 2012 were granted settlements by the Pennsylvania university yesterday

A statement released by the two lawyers on Friday quoted one of Sandusky's victims, known as Victim 7, who said: 'despite the settlements, my life will never feel back to normal.'

'If I had the power to go back in time and not ever meet Jerry Sandusky, I wouldn't hesitate.'

Neither the victims' lawyers nor the university's would reveal the exact amount of money that was awarded to victims the wake of Sandusky's conviction. 

Matt Rozen, the legal representative for Penn State said the university tried to round off all of the negotiations at the same time.

Mr Rozen told ABC news yesterday, the accusers were divided into three groups -  those who said they were abused before1998, between 1998 and 2001, and after 200 to correspomd with when university employees and officials were made aware of Sandusky's alleged behaviour.

He said: 'The range of resolution dollars varied on those factors.

'Every lawyer representing a claimant was well aware of those different stratifications, and accepted there are real differences between and among those claimants.'

On Friday it was revealed that "Victim 2" said he was the boy the
then-graduate assistant coach, Mike McQueary, testified he saw being attacked by
Jerry Sandusky in a team shower in 2001.

Mr McQueary notified school 
officials at the time, but police were never called.

Mr Casey, one of the victims' lawyers, did not disclose the terms of the settlements, but said they took shape
some time ago and were completed more than week ago, followed by passing 
paperwork back and forth to memorialize them.

'To say they're relieved, I think, is a
fair statement,' Casey said on August 23.

'But it's also accurate to say that while 
we've closed this chapter, there's a whole lot of this that's 
necessarily inadequate.'

Over a week ago, a lawyer disclosed 
the first settlement among the 31 lawsuits filed against the school amid
the Sandusky scandal.

Earlier last week, a lawyer brought in by Penn 
State to facilitate negotiations said he expected 24 more cases to 
settle in the near future.

A Penn State spokesman on Friday said only that settlement talks continued to progress. He declined further comment.

The school has spent nearly $50 million on the Sandusky scandal, not including any payments to the victims and accusers.

Other
lawyers involved in settlement talks said on Friday they were still 
working with the university but none had a signed, final agreement.

A sad ending: Legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno was fired before the end of the 2011 season amid the scandal and died only months later

Sandusky spent three decades at Penn 
State under former head coach Joe Paterno.

A 1998 complaint about 
Sandusky showering with a boy - one of those who testified against him -
was investigated by university police but no charges were filed. 
McQueary witnessed a different incident involving "Victim 2" in the team
shower in 2001 and notified Paterno and other high-ranking school 
officials, but police were not called.

The
response of university leaders, including Paterno, was heavily 
criticized in a report commissioned by the school last year. Paterno 
died in January 2012, but criminal charges for an alleged cover-up are 
pending against three others: former president Graham Spanier, retired 
vice president Gary Schultz and retired athletic director Tim Curley. 
All three deny the allegations.

Sandusky,
69, was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse and is serving a 
decades-long state prison sentence. He maintains he is innocent, and an 
appeals hearing is scheduled for next month in Dallas, Pa.
