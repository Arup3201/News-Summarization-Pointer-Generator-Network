Tenderly gazing over her infant son’s beribboned crib, it is study in royal portraiture.

Taken by legendary English photographer, Sir Cecil Beaton, this is the first official portrait of future king Prince Charles, shot at Buckingham Palace in December 1948, when he was just a month old.

Fast forward more than thirty years, and a rather startled-looking Prince William is introduced to the world by the Queen’s brother-in-law Lord Snowdon, another celebrated society photographer.

Although more relaxed than those featuring the Queen, they are still formal, studio portraits of a future king and his queen, proudly showing off the next generation of the family line.

Given the illustrious history of recent royal family portraits, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s decision to use one of proud grandpa Mike Middleton’s happy family snaps in the family backgarden – complete with pets - is a definite break with tradition.

And, inevitably, there will be those that feel that shots do not carry the gravitas normally expected of a formal family portrait.

According to well-placed royal sources, however, the decision was very much William and Kate’s.

‘It’s just where they feel happy and most comfortable,’ said an aide.

‘They are a young couple who have just had their first baby. There has been huge demand from the public to see some official photographs of Prince George. It seemed perfectly natural to them to pose for a few nice family snapshots which they could then issue.’

It is also understood that neither 
William or Kate, who were most recently photographed by celebrated 
fashion photographer Mario Testino for their official engagement 
portrait, were keen not to ‘burst the happily little family bubble’ they
 have existed in at the Middleton family home since George’s birth.

‘Inviting in a well-known society portraitist or a professional photographer is a very formal experience and one they weren’t keen to go through at this early stage,’ said a source.

‘The fact is that the formal portraits will all come when Prince George is christened in a few months’ time.

‘And as no-one knows when his first official engagement, so to speak, will be, it was sensible to release a few pictures to say thank you for all the  public support they have received.’

The Mail also understands that the couple were keen to take the wind out of the sails of the huge - and extremely lucrative - international market for unofficial paparazzi pictures of George by releasing their own at the earliest opportunity.

‘But the most important thing was that 
they genuinely felt much more comfortable having these shots taken by a 
member of their family,’ the source said.

A senior royal aide also made clear 
that the couple had been keen to issue a set of pictures as a mark of 
thanks for the privacy they had been given immediately after the birth 
of their son.

‘They asked 
the media to give them some time as a family – that was hugely important
 to them - and British media have done that,’ they added.

Renowned celebrity photographer Brian Aris, who has photographed almost every member of the royal family, ranging from the Queen and Princess Margaret to Princess Anne and more recently the then Kate Middleton, described the decision as ‘rather refreshing’.

He told the Mail: ‘It’s an unusual decision but perhaps reflects the young approach that Prince William wants to bring to bear.

‘Of course the pictures are historic 
and the decision to take them in such an informal manner means they, 
perhaps, lack the level of gravitas that would normally be expected.

‘But on the whole I would say this is quite refreshing.’

He
 added: ‘Taking a professional portrait of a young baby is quite an 
intrusive procedure, given the lighting and strobes you would need.

'I 
have to say I would never normally take a photograph of a baby under six
 weeks old, and this little one is just three.

‘So perhaps they have had the right idea after all.

'And who is to say it’s wrong? It’s just a refreshingly different approach.’
