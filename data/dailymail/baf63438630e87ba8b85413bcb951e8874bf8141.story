At first glance, the portfolio of work belonging to tattoo artist Chris Jones could be mistaken for a celebrity photo album.

But on closer inspection, his portraits including Marilyn Monroe and Noel Gallagher are in fact tattoos on legs and shoulders of his clients.

Mr Jones of Physical Graffiti in Cardiff has spent 12 years honing his skills to create a picture perfect portfolio of 'photo-realistic' images inked onto his customers’ skin.

Familiar? Noel Gallagher tattooed across someone's entire back. Tattoo artist Chris Jones said he is unshockable now, after receiving so many strange requests

His amazing creations include bespoke images of music stars and screen icons as well as Albert Einstein and Alec Guinness.

Dad-of-two Chris said he is now 'unshockable' after receiving requests for tattoos of Toy Story characters and stars from the Muppets.

He said: 'I’m lucky in that people want these things and I tattoo a lot of like-minded people who are geeky about stuff.

'Getting a piece tattooed on them from their favourite comic or film is awesome.'

The Da Vinci of tattoo designs describes his style as 'colour realism'.

He said: 'That’s what I enjoy doing the most because it’s challenging.

'When it comes to colour realism people are generally amazed that it’s a tattoo.

'A lot of people don’t believe that it is.'

Realistic tattoos have become more popular in recent years, with many music and TV stars opting for the art style.

I’m A Celebrity... contestant Helen Flanagan, 22, flaunted her tattoo of movie icon Marilyn Monroe on her left forearm during her stint in the jungle.

Chris has himself been inked with numerous tattoos, including a Star Wars image on his right leg and a drawing of Iron Man on his right thigh.

Beauty and the beast: Judy Garland and Hannibal Lecter were just two random requests made to Chris Jones

He said: 'It’s only recently that I have been getting stuff that I’m into. I have got a couple of colour-realism pieces.

'I am getting most of mine lasered off now so that I can start again.

'Tattooing isn’t as permanent as it was.'

Popular art: I'm A Celebrity contestant Helen Flanagan (pictured) has a Marilyn tattoo on her arm. Megan Fox also had one on her arm, before she had laser treatment to remove it in 2011

Realistic: Matt Smith as Dr Who. Realistic tattoos have become more popular in recent years
