David Cameron will today launch a web campaign to pile pressure on Labour and the Lib Dems to drop their opposition to giving the public a say on the EU.

The Prime Minister will risk coalition unity by urging voters in Lib Dem seats to bombard their MP with emails, web messages and tweets demanding they back a law on holding a referendum on Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

And he will use the
Let Britain Decide to challenge Labour leader Ed Miliband and his MPs to support legislation on holding an in-out vote.

Campaign: The Tory party has launched a stand-alone website which voters can use to pressure their MP into supporting an EU referendum

Speech: David Cameron used his long-awaited speech on the UK's relationship with the EU to promise an in-out referendum

The Tories have drafted a Bill committing to a referendum by the end of 2017.

But the Lib Dems are opposed to the plan, and have refused to give it government time to be debated.

Instead Conservative MP James Wharton will try to get it on to the statute book as a backbench Bill.

But it stands no chance of becoming law with only the support of Tory MPs.

Mr
Cameron has overseen the creation of a website which will allow voters 
from across the country to quickly and easily fire off messages to their
local MP to demand they support the first referendum on Europe for 40 
years.

It is hoped the 
electronic onslaught will force Labour and Lib Dem MPs to defy their 
party leaders - particularly in areas where the Tories’ pro-referendum 
policy could prove deceive in a tight general election in 2015.

The stand-alone campaign website at www.LetBritainDecide.com aims to ‘build public pressure, to give 
people a voice, and to urge MPs from other parties to listen to their 
constituents’.

Pressure: Labour leader Ed Miliband faces calls from half of his shadow cabinet to drop opposition to a referendum while Lib Dem Nick Clegg admits it is only a matter of time until a vote is held

Tory party 
chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Britain deserves a vote. It’s been nearly 
40 years since the British people last had their say on Europe. People 
feel the EU is heading in a direction they never signed up to.

‘That is why Conservatives want to give Britain a clear vote – in or out – before the end of 2017, after a full renegotiation.

‘A
draft Bill to make this happen will soon be debated by MPs – but, 
crucially, it needs the support of other political parties to pass. 
Britain needs everyone to build public pressure on this.’

It
is understood the web initiative has been modelled on the 38 Degrees 
campaign group, which pressured the government into banning animals from
circuses and abandoning plans to sell off forests.

A
draft Bill released by the Tories poses the question: 'Do you think 
that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?'.

The
vote would be held before 31 December 2017, but the legislation stands 
little chance of becoming law against opposition from the Lib Dems and 
Labour.

The Tory party has vowed to impose a 
three-line whip on its MPs in an attempt to give the Bill the best 
possible chance of becoming law.

The stand-alone website will allow voters to send emails, tweets and Facebook messages to persuade their local MP to back a referendum

The Prime Minister has told his MPs they must scrap constituency meetings to make sure they are in Westminster for the vote on Mr Wharton's Bill.

Mr Wharton said: ‘Fundamentally this is about democracy and trusting the people.

‘We must give the British people a choice on this important issue, and have an open and frank debate before that decision.

‘I hope that MPs from all sides will 
back the Bill and show that they back democracy, and the right of their 
constituents to decide on our future in the EU.’

Promise: Tory MP James Wharton's private members' bill would enshrine into law a a pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe

Half of the shadow cabinet reportedly want Mr Miliband to commit to an in-out vote ahead of the 2015 general election.

They fear being portrayed as being unwilling to trust the British public.

Growing
number of pro-Europeans also believe Britain could vote to leave the EU
unless they publicly back a referendum and start making the case to 
stay in.

The Prime Minister used a long-awaited speech in January to announce a future Tory government would seek to renegotiate a ‘fresh settlement’ with Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.

He promised he would campaign for Britain to stay in a reformed EU but added: ‘I say to the British people: This will be your decision.’

The dramatic pledge piled pressure on Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who argued it created uncertainty which could threaten investment in Britain.

Last month the Tory party published a draft Bill legislating on holding an in-out vote before 2017.

Mr Wharton topped a ballot of MPs to have the chance to take legislation through the Commons, and agreed to try to pass the EU Bill.

However, both the Lib Dems and Labour have remained opposed to it.

Mr Clegg, however, standing in for Mr Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions, surprised MPs when he said it was a question of 'when, not if' to hold an in/out referendum.

And a Labour for a Referendum campaign has been launched, with the backing of more than 150 councillors and MPs, demanding Mr Miliband drop his opposition to giving the public a say.

Millionaire Labour donor John Mills said: ‘I think the Labour Party would be unwise to rule out having a referendum before the run-up to the next general election. A lot can happen over the next two years.’
