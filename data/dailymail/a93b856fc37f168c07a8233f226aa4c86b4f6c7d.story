Heather Watson offered resistance but, yet again, the British challenge beyond Andy Murray has swiftly melted away like one of Wimbledon’s overpriced ice creams.

At 6.13pm on the first Thursday the GB men’s No 1 was left in his customary position of glorious isolation when his opposite number in the women’s game finally succumbed to Germany’s Angelique Kerber.

It was an uneven performance by the 22-year-old from Guernsey, but it is hardly a disgrace to lose 6-2, 5-7, 6-1 to the number nine seed, who reached the semi-final here two years ago.

Show of steel: Angelique Kerber stepped up her performance to close out the final set 6-1 to win

Watson lifted her game as the Centre 
Court belatedly began to fill up after many took a break following the 
Rafael Nadal show. But the effort of levelling the match appeared to 
have sapped her for the decider.

So Murray will take his place in this afternoon’s third round singles but no Brit has really come close to joining him, although Watson and Naomi Broady made a stab at it by winning a match.

The Channel Islander spoke from a position of strength when she concurred with the opinion offered by outgoing Lawn Tennis Association coach Julien Hofferlin  that one cause of the failure is that some British players are spoiled. She did not spare the coaches, either.

‘I understand where he’s coming from.  I see it with some players more than others,’ said Watson. ‘We are a strong, rich federation, so I can see that people would say that, whether we were doing well or not.

'You see that with those rich federations. I see some (players) not working week in, week out — kind of choosing when they want to work.   I think the coaches let them slip, let them get away with it.

‘Nothing is said if they just don’t want to play that week or don’t want to give it enough.  I don’t think it’s all the players —  it’s coaches, too.  But if a player wants to make it, it’s up to them. For example, I see (GB youngster) Katy Dunn.  I did an off-season training camp with her and every single day she worked hard. Then I’ve done it with others and I saw a very different story.’

Roar of success: Heather Watson battled back to win the second set against Kerber on Thursday

22 - Watson won just 22 per cent of points on her second serve, a large reason that she lost. Kerber won 35 per cent — not good but enough to seal the win.

There have actually been worse Wimbledons than this for Great Britain as, believe it or not, for four out of the previous seven years only two or less players got through the first round. The nadir was 2010, when Murray stood alone after an unprecedented first-round cull.

These are utterly embarrassing statistics when taking into account the fact that these brilliantly- managed Championships have, for the past 20 years, pumped money into the British game like a Saudi oil refinery gushes petro- dollars.

At present, the figure is around £35 million per year flowing into the Lawn Tennis Association’s coffers, yet it becomes a national event if someone other than Murray makes the second week, as the sadly absent Laura Robson managed last year.

Perhaps the most worrying aspect is that next week’s junior event will offer little in the way of optimism for any sustained upturn in the mid-term — although the likes of Watson, Robson (if she recovers from a devilish injury) and teenager Kyle Edmund show that where there is life, there is hope.

Marching on: Angelique Kerber proved too strong for a plucky Heather Watson in their second-round game

It is not just at Wimbledon that this has been a dispiriting few weeks for the British game. Watson won three matches at Eastbourne but there has otherwise been  little to show for the copious wildcards handed out this whole grass court season.

The Wimbledon hierarchy are known to be as frustrated as anyone about this. Next year, there is no  certainty  they will accept the LTA’s recommendations that players ranked below 250 will get a privileged entry worth a minimum £27,000 each.

Fortunately, there are signs of enlightenment in some areas from the governing body’s relatively new leadership team of Canadian Michael Downey and chairman David Gregson.

They are right to place a clearer focus on grass-roots participation and there are already signs of an upturn in that area.

However, there are no indications that officials are prepared to take the radical course of action necessary at the elite end of the game. This would involve the LTA removing itself as much as possible from the process and placing more responsibility on individuals to develop their own careers.

Elaborate talent identification schemes are clearly not working, and too often you see players handed around like a bag of sweets to centrally-employed coaches and getting caught up in internal politics. A fundamental rethink is required and the LTA’s main board, made up largely of well-meaning amateurs, simply have to get to grips with this.

Watson, schooled at the IMG/Bollettieri Academy in Florida, knows how to put up a fight but she could not hold back the tide of 26 break points against her serve — nine of which were taken.  Kerber, a tricky southpaw, is a phenomenal retriever around the back court.

Although Watson played a high quality, aggressive second set she could not maintain the necessary level to put a hardened opponent under pressure.

The consolation is that her ranking is heading in the right direction from its current standing of 60 and, with few points to defend for the rest of this year, it is only a matter of time before she rejoins the world’s top 50.
