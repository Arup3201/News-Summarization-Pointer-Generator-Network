Music has long been said to soothe a troubled soul but now it appears it can also alleviate physical pain.

Four out of ten people who suffered persistent pain said listening to music helped relieve their symptoms.

Among 16 to 24-year-olds in the survey of 1,500 people, the figure was 66 per cent.

Fittingly, the song that helped the most was Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water, followed by Angels by Robbie Williams, Fleetwood Mac’s Albatross, Elton John’s Candle In The Wind and Easy by The Commodores.

Pop was the most popular type of music – helping 21 per cent of people – followed by classical music at 17 per cent, and rock or indie music at 16 per cent, according to a UK survey of over 1,500 people conducted by LloydsPharmacy.

‘People in pain should try to find some activity to get fully engaged in,’ said David Bradshaw of the University of Utah Pain Management Centre.

‘Listening to favourite music is excellent for that because it can involve both thoughts and feelings.

‘No matter how anxious you may feel, if you can get absorbed in the music this can help with your pain.’

Of those who listened to music to help with pain, a third said they did so as often as they could, while 40 per cent listened just in the evenings.

An estimated 10million people in Britain experience some pain on most days.

Latest figures suggest that four out of five adults will suffer back pain at some stage in their lives, while around 10million people in Britain are living with arthritis.

Previous studies have found that stress and anxiety worsen the experience of pain, so anything that helps to make people feel relaxed can also help with their pain.

LloydsPharmacy pharmacist Andrew Mawhinney said: 'There are lots of different ways of managing pain, not only with medicines but also with lifestyle changes such as moderate exercise and relaxation.

'After speaking to many people who are living with pain we were interested to learn just how many found music beneficial, which is why we're now trialling the use of music within our pain service in some of our pharmacies.'

David Bradshaw, a Research Assistant Professor at The University of Utah Pain Management Centre in the United States, said: 'People in pain should try to find some activity to get fully engaged in. 'Listening to favourite music is excellent for that because it can involve both thoughts and feelings. 'No matter how anxious you may feel, if you can get absorbed in the music this can help with your pain. Choose music you like and know well, humming or singing along can help you engage in listening and distract you from your pain.'

Top-five songs to relax to as recommended by people living with persistent pain were:

1. Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel2. Angels by Robbie Williams3. Albatross  by Fleetwood Mac4. Candle In The Wind by Elton John5. Easy by The Commodores
