After the conclusion of Tuesday's Capital one Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Liverpool, the winning manager will have extra cause for celebration.

Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers share their birthdays on Monday January 26, and securing a trip to Wembley on March 1 for a shot at claiming the first silverware of the season is sure to be top of their wishlists.

Whether the duo will be exchanging cards, though, is not so certain. Former colleagues, Mourinho and Rodgers' relationship has been on the wane since developing a rivalry during last season's title race.

'When you're fighting for the same competition, the friendship… I have a huge respect for him, wonderful man, coach, but in time you are so engrossed in your own work, you don't communicate as much, you don't have the conversations you had before and ultimately you could be a rival,' Rodgers said before last week's first leg.

The Liverpool boss, who turns 42 on Monday and is 10 years the Chelsea manager's junior, was once Mourinho's protegee after working under him during his first spell in charge of Chelsea from 2004 to 2007.

In 2013, Rodgers even credited Mourinho for his ascent towards becoming Liverpool manager, admitting that he learned valuable lessons under the Portuguese's guidance during his formative coaching years.

'I probably wouldn't be sat here today if it wasn't for him,' Rodgers said. 'He played a huge part in my career.'

But the Reds boss has a lot of catching up to do to if he is to emulate his former teacher.

The only piece of silverware Rodgers has been able to get his hands on during his six-and-a-half years as a manager is the play-off trophy, and if he is to convince people he is the real deal it is time he won something more meaningful.

When Mourinho was Rodgers' age he was six months into his reign at Chelsea and had already won two Portuguese league titles with Porto.

And Mourinho had turned heads in Europe, too. In his first full season with the Portuguese giants he led Porto to UEFA Cup success before shocking the football world by winning the 2003-04 Champions League, famously eliminating Manchester United along the way.

There was also a Portuguese Cup and Portuguese Super Cup to add to Mourinho's swelling list of honours. 

The 52-year-old's rise to the top was as rapid as it was extraordinary. Rodgers, on the other hand, spent four years with Watford, Reading and Swansea before joining a Liverpool side that had finished eighth in 2011-12.

And there was little improvement the following season as Rodgers led the Anfield club to seventh in his first season in charge.

But Rodgers' search for his first major trophy almost ended last season before Liverpool fell at the last hurdle in the Premier League title race.

And it was against his former mentor that Rodgers' house of cards came tumbling down.

The 2-0 defeat by Chelsea back in April allowed Manchester City to usurp Liverpool at the top of the table as Rodgers missed out on bringing a league title to Merseyside.

After the game the Northern Irishman was critical of Mourinho's defensive gameplan, claiming Chelsea had 'parked two buses' in front of the Liverpool goal.

In truth, Mourinho simply masterminded a costly tactical victory over Rodgers.

But despite a difficult start to the 2014-15 campaign, which has left Liverpool languishing in eighth place, Rodgers has another opportunity to win his first trophy.

Chelsea go into Tuesday's second leg as favourites after the 1-1 draw at Anfield last week, but there was enough about Liverpool's performance to suggest that Jose Mourinho's side won't have it all their own way at Stamford Bridge.

Beyond the Capital One Cup, Saturday's freak results in the FA Cup will have given Rodgers hope that another shot at Wembley is well within reach.

With four of the top six in the Premier League crashing out of the competition, Liverpool automatically became one of the favourites to lift the trophy along with Manchester United and Arsenal.

The Reds will have to play a replay at the Macron Stadium, however, after being held to a goalless draw by Bolton in the fourth round.

There has been no suggestion that Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool, and he was backed by the owners in their New Year message to supporters, but another season without a trophy or a top-four finish and he may be feeling heat.
