Desperate: Jacob Hancock, 18, committed suicide after being tormented for years at North Sanpete high school in Utah

Parents have filed a wrongful death lawsuit after claiming a school failed to protect their son from years of 
bullying, hazing and false sex assault allegations that led to his 
suicide.

Bradd and
Edna Hancock were seeking unspecified financial damages against North Sanpete 
School District in the document filed on January 17.

Their son Jacob Hancock, 18, took his own life on January
21, 2010 in Fountain Green, Utah. 

The high school senior was the target of 
physical and emotional abuse from students and school district employees
for more than five years.

The school failed to adequately protect the teenager according to Sonny Olsen, an attorney for the Hancock family.

It was not clear why Jacob Hancock was targeted but court papers said the bullying and harassment began with 
gay slurs from three male students while Hancock was in the eighth
grade.

The abuse escalated to physical assaults, including 
pushing Jacob Hancock against a wall and a fist fight that ended with 
all involved being referred to juvenile court, the lawsuit stated.

One 
assault occurred while Jacob Hancock was naked and showering in the 
boys' locker room.  Teammates reportedly touched his genitals and urinated on 
his towel.

Following a complaint from his parents, the school district offered to buy Jacob Hancock a new towel.

Similar attacks continued for 18 
months without intervention by the district, the lawsuit claims, increasing Jacob Hancock's 
anxieties and negatively affecting his academic performance.

Jacob
Hancock began to lash out at others and suffered a mental 
breakdown where he was placed on suicide watch.

The bullying and harassment continued into high
school and included at least one death threat from another student. 
Agitated and unable to sleep, Jacob Hancock first attempted suicide in 
2008, court papers stated.

The harassment continued in 2009, 
including incidents in which Jacob Hancock was physically restrained by a school police officer and hit by another.

The same year, a football
coach said publicly that he believed Hancock looked like a pedophile.

The lawsuit also alleged that a high school 
vice-principal publicly discussed Jacob Hancock's emotional struggles 
with teachers and students, including stating that Hancock had suffered a
mental breakdown.

'It's not like Jacob was a 
kid that nobody knew about. It we can't save a kid in that
setting, then either our policies are wrong or the people that are 
executing them are not the right people.' 

Sonny Olsen, attorney for Hancock family

After his father Bradd Hancock complained about the 
administrator's actions, Jacob Hancock was accused of sexually abusing a
teenage girl and was arrested.

The girl later said she had only been 'tickled' and the charges were reduced.

Jacob
Hancock was suspended from school and then unsuccessfully tried to 
enroll elsewhere.

Those efforts were blocked by false
reports from the Sanpete school district that Hancock had been expelled, according to records.

Jacob Hancock committed suicide a few months later.

The lawsuit contends that district 
officials failed to protect Jacob Hancock properly and did not implement
existing policies against bullying, hazing 
and suicide prevention.

Mr Olsen said: 'It's not like Jacob was a 
kid that nobody knew about. It we can't save a kid in that
setting, then either our policies are wrong or the people that are 
executing them are not the right people.'

The lawsuit names the school district, its board and the Sanpete County sheriff's
office, which provides schools with campus-based officers, as defendants.

The North Sanpete High School and Middle School principals were also 
individually named in the lawsuit, as were other school employees 
and two police officers.

Victoria Schoenfeld, spokeswoman for the Division of Risk 
Management, said: 'We
have received the complaint and we understand a suit has been filed, 
but we're in a phase right now where we are still gathering 
information.'

Sanpete County Attorney Brody Keisel said the sheriff's office was aware of 
the lawsuit and will defend itself against the claims.

Family lawyer Mr Olsen said
the Hancocks were bringing the lawsuit two years after their son's 
death because continued inquiries into how Jacob Hancock was treated 
suggested school officials were negligent in their handling of the 
situation.

The lawsuit stated: 'As reported by other students and peers, the 
harassing conduct was so prevalent and obvious that the responsible 
adults must have known, and indeed, witnesses it.

'J.H.'s actions in taking his own life were a foreseeable result of the
defendant's tortuous acts.'
