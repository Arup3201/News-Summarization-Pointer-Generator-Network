A jilted lover threatened to send sexually explicit photos and videos to his ex-girlfriend's employer to ruin her chances of getting promotion.

Binman Gary Miller, of Salford, Greater Manchester, sent his lover 44 messages in under a month, some of which were threats to send naked images and footage of her to her council employers.

Bombarding the victim with texts, the 44-year-old married father-of-one wrote 'I am going to send an email with photos to Leeds City Council' and 'Your boss will love it, promotion over'.

A court heard that despite Miller threatening to send the material to her employers he tried to keep the case from his own bosses and family.

Miller had been involved in an alleged racist incident at work last September and claimed the stress caused by that and his suspension from his job as a Salford council binman caused him to act out of character.

In the incident Miller, a UNISON shop steward, was accused of telling a Polish worker that town hall jobs are 'for English people'.

Miller also claimed his relationship with the victim was a way of talking to someone about his job and drinking problems.

The pair only met in person three times but exchanged numerous 'sexually explicit' photos and videos, Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court heard.

It was said that the nature of their relationship was mainly sexual.

Louise Hartley, prosecuting, said: 'The complainant and defendant met on Facebook in 2014. They met in person on three occasions. 

'Between November 17 and December 13 last year she was sent 44 texts, most of which were sexually explicit.

'She responded to three in the hope he would leave her alone.'

But former Royal Marine Miller continued to harass the victim with texts messages and threats.

Defence barrister Patrick Williamson said: 'He has said his mind was clouded by problems at work and because he was drinking so much.'

Miller was ordered to pay £85 court costs and £60 victim surcharge, as well as undergoing a community order and curfew preventing him leaving home between 6pm-6am after pleading guilty to harassment. 

He was also given a two-year restraining order preventing him contacting the victim.

Magistrate Gary Gillespie said of 'revenge porn': 'It is becoming more a feature of a relationship that breaks down. What is deemed to be private is becoming public and used as a weapon.'
