A Labour frontbencher came under fire today after branding David Cameron's new female ministers 'puppets'.

Shadow media minister Helen Goodman was accused of sexism after claiming 'their appearance really is most interesting thing about them'.

The Prime Minister used his reshuffle on Tuesday to promote several female MPs, who were pictured walking along the 'Downing Street catwalk' to learn of their new roles.

Labour's shadow media minister Helen Goodman sparked a furious response with her claim that Tory female ministers were only interesting for their looks

Liz Truss, Nicky Morgan, Penny Mordaunt, Priti Patel, Amber Rudd and Anna Soubry were among the ministers photographed walking up the steps to Number 10 on Tuesday.

Employment Minister Esther McVey yesterday laughed off being dubbed Queen of the Downing Street catwalk as 'fine if it inspires girls to go into politics'. 

She told Sky News: ‘Well all I can say is that it's fantastic having women in powerful positions in the newspapers and if that meant we were walking, the paper might have called it, 'a catwalk' - we were walking into Number 10 Downing Street.

‘And for the last 15 years I have worked with kids from inner city areas - young girls who are looking for role models. They see Nicky Morgan, Secretary of state for Education, and they’re thinking 'hey that’s something could do.'’ 

Labour had criticised the Mail's coverage of the reshuffle for being sexist for focussing too heavily on women and what they wore.

But today Ms Goodman wrote on Twitter: 'Mail's page on Tory women was fair: all are puppets who'll change nothing and their appearance really is most interesting thing about them.'

The remarks sparked a furious response on the internet. Mrs Morgan, the new Education Secretary, called on Labour leader Ed Miliband to act.

'Disappointing words from shadow minister Helen Goodman,' she posted online. 'Will Ed Miliband condemn these appalling comments?' 

Tory MP Nadine Dorries wrote: 'Truly shocking tweet. Maybe you should check your sexist comments with your women and equality boss Gloria de Piero first.'

Claire Perry, the new transport minister, said: 'Helen, I can't imagine you actually think that given how much work we have done together on child protection online. 

'Tragic that sensible female MP like you can't tell your Labour bully boys to get stuffed when they give you nonsense to tweet.'

Defence Minister Anna Soubry - another of those featured - demanded an apology.

'Helen Goodman's comments were deliberately insulting,' she said.

'She should personally apologise to every one of the talented women she has chosen to cheaply slur.'

'Ed Miliband needs to make clear that these comments are absolutely unacceptable.'

Another Tory MP, Sarah Newton, wrote a letter calling for action against Ms Goodman to Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman, who last week railed against the sexism against women still prevalent at Westminster.

'This disgraceful and demeaning slur damages not only those Conservative MPs referred to, but all women in politics,' she wrote.

'Ms Goodman is a member of your Shadow Ministerial team. It is therefore incumbent upon you either to condemn her remarks, or pass the matter to Ed Miliband to take disciplinary action.

'Given that you have devoted much of your political career to advancing the cause of women in public life, it will be deeply disappointing if you ignore Ms Goodman's repulsive remarks.' 

As the row erupted, Ms Goodman said the comment had been meant as a joke.

'I'm very sorry my last tweet offended some people. I intended it as a light-hearted remark,' she said. She has now deleted the message. 

Amazingly, Labour stood by Ms Goodman. A party spokesman said: 'The Labour Party's view is that David Cameron's promises on increasing the representation of women are a sham.

He said a third of all his ministers would be women. Fewer than one-in-four are. It is David Cameron who has failed.'
