After scoring 183 goals for Liverpool, he certainly knows what to do when he can see the net.

But when his sight was temporarily taken away on Monday night, a blindfolded Robbie Fowler ended up kicking the ball into comedian John Bishop during a half-time charity challenge at Anfield.

Fowler, 37, and Bishop, 46, were on the pitch at half-time of the game between Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion to support a campaign to eradicate avoidable blindness in developing countries.

Oops: A blindfolded Robbie Fowler kicked a ball into comedian John Bishop's face on Monday night during a half-time charity challenge at Liverpool's Anfield stadium to raise awareness for an anti-blindness campaign

Oh dear: A mascot in the goal put his head in his hands after watching Fowler kick the ball into Bishop's face

Former Liverpool striker Fowler, his son Jacob and Bishop took penalties while blindfolded during the interval to support the 'Seeing is Believing' charity, which had its name printed on their shirts.

But when Fowler stepped up to take his kick at half-time, Liverpool-born comedian Bishop crawled in front of him and ended up getting the ball blasted in his face from just inches away.

Bishop saw the funny side of the incident and reeled away in laughter, leaving the crowd in stitches.

The kick was captured by Sky Sports cameras, who were showing the Premier League game, and although it happened during an advert break, it was still broadcast before the second half began.

Liverpool replaced their usual 
'Standard Chartered' sponsors with the slogan 'Seeing is Believing' on 
all of their shirts during the 2-0 defeat to West Brom, which will be 
auctioned to aid the cause.

'For all asking I still have all my teeth despite Robbie Fowler and his left boot. Unfortunately after the result I can't smile to prove it'

Steven
 Gerrard, 32, captain of Liverpool, said before the match of the 
charity: 'You realise at the time how difficult it is without your 
sight, especially doing activities.

'We
 were involved in a penalty shootout using a blindfold and it's so 
difficult. It was really enjoyable to take part and very important for 
myself and the club as well to play our part and try to help these 
people.'

Bishop said on 
Twitter on Monday night: ‘For all asking I still have all my teeth despite 
Robbie Fowler and his left boot. Unfortunately after the result (Liverpool's 2-0 defeat) I can't 
smile to prove it.’

Former England star Gary Lineker said: 'Great block from John Bishop. Highlight of the night so far.'
