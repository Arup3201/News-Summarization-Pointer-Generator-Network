Louis van Gaal has endured a difficult start to life in the Premier League, but that hasn't stopped the Manchester United boss from steering his side to crucial victories against the club's closest rivals.

The 2-1 victory against Liverpool on Sunday saw United leap to first spot in the head-to-head mini-table of the Premier League's current top five.

Van Gaal's side have now earned 10 points from fives games against the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea with three games against the top five remaining.

The mini-league will come as a small crumb of comfort for United fans as their side battle it out for a Champions League spot while the Old Trafford club's transition under Van Gaal continues.

The Dutch boss has certainly had his critics this season, but a Premier League double against Liverpool will do Van Gaal no harm in the eyes of the Red Devils faithful and a 2-1 victory against Arsenal at the Emirates in November is not to be sniffed at. 

United still have to play City (H), Chelsea (A) and Arsenal (H), but they look a different team to the one that struggled through the winter months.

He said: 'Now the gap is five points ahead of Liverpool and six ahead of Tottenham and Southampton so the moment to win is one of the most important in my career.'
