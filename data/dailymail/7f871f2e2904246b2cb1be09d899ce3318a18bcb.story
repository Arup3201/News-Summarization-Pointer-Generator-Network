Westerners in Turkey have been warned to be vigilant after a suicide bomber detonated an explosive today in front of the U.S. Embassy in Ankara.

The blast in the capital killed the bomber and a guard at the entrance gate before the British mission in Istanbul made clear officials feared there could be further outrages.

The White House condemned the attack on the U.S. Embassy as 'an act of terror' while the British embassy warned Westerners to 'be vigilant'.

There was no immediate claim of 
responsibility, but Turkey's interior minister, Muammer Guler, said the 
bomber was likely connected to a domestic left-wing militant group. He 
did not explain why.

The president's spokesman says it is not yet known who is responsible, but a suicide bombing on the perimeter of an embassy is, by definition, a terrorist act. A 
Turkish woman was also seriously wounded and two other guards sustained 
lighter wounds in the 1.15pm blast in the Turkish capital, Guler told 
reporters.

A police official, meanwhile, said the bomber is most likely a suspected member of 
the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front. He spoke on 
condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak to the 
press.

The group has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United States but had been relatively quiet in recent years.

The explosion occurred inside the 
security checkpoint at the side entrance to the U.S. embassy, which was 
being used by staff.

A guard standing outside the checkpoint was killed 
and while the two other guards 'were standing in a more protected area,'
Guler said.

Police and ambulances swarmed the area and authorities immediately cordoned it off.

TV footage showed the embassy door 
blown off its hinges. The windows of nearby businesses were also 
shattered by the power of the blast, and debris littered the ground and 
across the road. The inside of the embassy did not appear to be damaged.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan said the attack demonstrated a need for international 
cooperation against terrorism and was aimed at disturbing Turkey's 
'peace and prosperity.'

'But we will stand firm and we will overcome this together,' he said.

In a statement, the U.S. Embassy thanked Turkey for 'its solidarity and outrage over the incident.'

The embassy building is heavily 
protected and located near several other embassies in Ankara, including 
that of Germany and France.

The Hurriyet newspaper said staff at the 
embassy took shelter in 'safe room' inside the compound soon after the 
explosion.

Guler identified the injured woman as 
38-year-old Didem Tuncay, a television journalist and a hospital 
official said she was 'not in a critical condition.'

News reports said 
she was at the embassy to get a U.S. visa.

'We can confirm a terrorist blast at a
check point on the perimeter of our embassy compound in Ankara, Turkey,
at 1.13pm local time,' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland 
said in Washington.

'We are working closely with the 
Turkish national police to make a full assessment of the damage and the 
casualties, and to begin an investigation,' she said.

U.S. diplomatic facilities in Turkey 
have been targeted previously by terrorists. In 2008, an attack blamed 
on al-Qaida-affiliated militants outside the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul 
left three assailants and three policemen dead.

Elsewhere, terrorists attacked a U.S. 
mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11 last year, killing U.S. 
Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The attackers in 
Libya were suspected to have ties to Islamist extremists, and one is in 
custody in Egypt.

The force of the blast damaged nearby buildings in the Cankaya neighbourhood where many other state institutions and embassies are also located

British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the attack 'in the strongest terms'

Britain's Foreign Secretary William 
Hague condemned Friday's attack 'in the strongest terms,' and said 
Turkey and the U.S. will get the U.K.'s full support as they seek to 
hold those responsible to account.

Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet 
Davutoglu, speaking to reporters during a visit to Belgrade, Serbia, 
said he was saddened that the attacked had occurred in Turkey.

'We have always shown great sensitivity to the protection of foreign missions and we will continue to do so,' he said.

Homegrown Islamic militants tied to 
al-Qaida have also carried out suicide bombings in Istanbul, Turkey's 
bustling commercial center. In a 2003 attack on the British consulate, a
suspected Islamic militant rammed an explosive-laden pickup truck into 
the main gate, killing 58 people, including the British consul-general.

Turkey is also being deeply affected 
by the brutal civil war in neighboring Syria, and has become a harsh 
critic of President Bashar Assad's regime there. The war has left at 
least 60,000 people dead so far, according to the U.N., and Turkey is 
sheltering tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.

The first of six Patriot missile 
batteries being deployed to Turkey to protect the country against attack
from Syria was just declared operational and placed under NATO command.
Others are expected to become operational in the coming days.
