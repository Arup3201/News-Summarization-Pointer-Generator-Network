A 45-year-old man has been charged with willful animal cruelty after a video caught him purposefully mowing down a pet chihuahua belonging to his estranged wife and children in an incident that was captured on two separate surveillance systems.

In one disturbing video released by police - for which The Mail Online advises viewer discretion - Michael David Parker, of Hawthorne in Southern California, can be seen backing up his Nissan Maxima before driving straight over his helpless pooch, named Cow Cow, and zooming off.

The incident, which occurred about noon on December 28, happened in an alleyway that wasn't at all connected to Parker's home, the Daily Breeze reported.

'He purposefully did it': Police allege Michael David Parker, 45, intentionally ran over and killed his pet dog Cow Cow. The incident was caught on camera and he has been charged with animal cruelty

Evidence: The video first shows Michael David Parker removing something from his trunk, which is suspected to be dog Cow Cow, who then runs out in front of the vehicle

The Nissan sedan then reverses down the alley

Shocking: This moment was captured moments before a defenseless dog was run over, allegedly by its owner

The footage shows Parker pulling up and getting out of his car to retrieve something from his trunk, suspected to be his dog, who was five and a half years old.

The dog then runs out into the alley and in front of the car.

Park reverses somewhat, before gunning the car straight for Cow Cow, who seems to try and avoid the vehicle before being hit.

Parker keeps driving as Cow Cow is left convulsing on the road.

A resident found the pint-sized dog lying bloodied and lifeless in the alleyway.

Police began investigating but only recently found the camera footage, using it to trace the cars plates.

Parker was then arrested on Friday.

'It's shocking,' Hawthorne Police Lt. Scott Swain told the New York Daily News.

'You never expect to see a little animal like that run over and left there to die without the driver even looking back.

Surveillance cameras set up on houses in the alley where the dead dog was found had footage of the incident. Here you can see Michael David Parker's car approaching 'Cow Cow', seconds before hitting making impact

'It wasn't an accident.

'He purposefully did it.'

Parker recently split from his wife, Olga.

The dog had been staying with a neutral third party while the couple organized the split.

Olga told KTLA that she believes Cow Cow was killed because she refused to give Parker money from their retirement fund.

'If someone would do that to a dog .. what would he do to my kids,' she told the TV network.

Police say Parker admits to be in the alley that afternoon but denies intentionally harming the defenseless dog.

Parker posted $20,000 bail and was ordered back to court for arraignment on March 25.
