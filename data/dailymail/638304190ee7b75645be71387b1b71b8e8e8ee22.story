Dougie Freedman has left Bolton 'by mutual consent' after almost two years as manager.

The Scot looked as if he would be in charge for Saturday's match against Bournemouth but chairman Phil Gartside has decided to act. 

Academy director Jimmy Phillips, who was briefly joint-caretaker boss with Sammy Lee before Freedman's appointment, is the strong bookies' favourite, with Brian McDermott, Tim Sherwood, Neil Lennon and Malky Mackay also in the mix.

In a statement Gartside said: 'Dougie has worked tirelessly off the field to improve the infrastructure of the football club. Unfortunately, recent results on the pitch have not reflected all his work off it.

'The club has faced a difficult time following our relegation from the Premier League and Dougie has helped to restructure the club in order for it to become successful again under ever-tightening constraints.

'I would like to thank Dougie personally for all his commitment and efforts for Bolton Wanderers.'  

Gartside had been loyal to Freedman - who has had to cut costs and work within tighter budgetary constraints - and believed there were signs the manager was heading in the right direction. 

However, results and recent performances put pressure on him to make a change before Bolton get cut adrift by the teams above them.

The main issue seemed to be whether they could pay Freedman off - and then who would replace him.

The club also unsurprisingly announced that they had cancelled their Friday press conference.

Odds from Coral

7-2 Jimmy Phillips, 10-1 Brian McDermott, Neil Lennon, Tim Sherwood, Billy Davies, 12-1 Malky Mackay, Roberto Di Matteo, 16-1 Ole Gunnar Solksjaer, Tony Mowbray, Phil Brown, Keith Hill 

Bolton have won just once in the Championship this season and are second from bottom with only Blackpool - who only had eight players the day before the season started - below them.

The players did not seem to be playing for Freedman and the manager, who talked in an interview last week about trying to find a settled side, chops and changes frequently - there were five against Fulham. This has led to some horrendous performances, home and away.

The fans lost patience with him, too, as the vocal minority have become the majority. There were pitch invasions against Derby on Saturday and chants for the manager to go at Craven Cottage.

Those supporters now have their wish.
