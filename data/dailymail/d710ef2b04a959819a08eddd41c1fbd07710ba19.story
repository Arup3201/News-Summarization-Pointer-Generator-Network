An Oregon teacher who admitted sexually abusing one of her 16-year-old students sobbed hysterically in court as she was sentenced to a month's jail time.

Denise Keesee, a math and special education teacher at Sherwood High School, pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree abuse as part of a plea deal as she was given a 30-day jail sentence and five years probation.

Keesee also must register as a sex offender, surrender her teaching license, complete sex offender treatment and have no contact with teens unless approved by her probation officer.

The 39-year-old was first investigated in 2008 when a mother reported finding inappropriate text messages between the teacher and her son.

Jailed: Denise Keesee (seen here during an earlier court appearance) has now been sentenced to 30-days in jail and five years probation after admitting two counts of sexual abuse. She will never be able to teach again

Keesee has been out on custody since the day after her arrest in June of last year.

When she addressed the court, she said had already completed hundreds of hours of therapy.

'I’m doing everything I can to rectify my wrong,' she said. 'I am motivated to continue to change.'

She begged the judge to keep her out of custody.

'I want you to know I am learning the truth about myself, and this has been a painful process,' she sobbed.

'I am doing this to be a better wife, sister, member of society and, most importantly, the best mom I can be to my 9-year-old son.'

The loss of her career, the embarrassment and shame she’s suffered because of this case were punishment enough, she said.

'I am deeply sorry for any pain and suffering I have caused,' she said. 'I will strive for the rest of my life to never cause anyone such harm.'

Her defense attorney James Jensen told the judge that, as a child, Keesee suffered physical and emotional abuse.

'I would attribute this case to past challenges my client suffered in her life, he said.

She is committed to saving her marriage, being a good mother and changing her behavior', Jensen said.

Her lawyer also told the court that she was devastated that she will never teach again.

'Teaching wasn’t just a career for my client, it was her identity,' Jensen said.

Arrest: Denise Keesee admitted having sex with a 16-year-old student and kissing an 18-year-old at the school

According to Oregon Live, at the time of the allegations, Keesee was married to a police officer who also worked at the school. 

According to the deputy district attorney Paul Maloney, Kessee admitted to police that she had sex with a student in 2008.

In
 court documents the teacher stated that the pair had sex on several 
occasions at her house, the student's home and in a park. 

The
 student, who was 16 at the time, believed he was in a long-term 
relationship and that Keesee would marry him when he had finished 
school, Detective Robert Rookhuyzen told Oregon Live.

Keesee
 contacted police in May 2008 to raise concerns about the student's 
state of mind. She had received an email from him, that appeared to show
 suicidal thoughts.

In the email, the victim wrote: 'I'm sick of life and how I'm lying/I'm sick of this earth and what I'm trying to do/I'm sick of everything just want to be true'.

It was during that investigation that the teacher admitted to having sexual contact with another student in 2012, who she admitted to kissing in her classroom several times in 2012.

Detectives said she admitted sending the student a naked photos of herself. Because he was 18, no criminal charges were filed.

One of the students, who is now in his 20s, filed a $5.1million lawsuit against Keesee and the Sherwood School District, allegeing that she sexually abused him, that her husband intimidated him, and that the school failed to report the abuse.

Role: Keesee was working as a math and special education teacher at Sherwood High School

The student she admitted to abusing 
did not attend the sentencing, although the other student, whom she 
denies abusing, did attend.

He has filed a lawsuit against her and the Sherwood School District.

The
 lawsuit came days after her June 17 arrest. Later that month, Sherwood 
police placed Keesee's husband, Officer Adam Keesee, on leave.

Oregon
 State Police investigated the Sherwood cop on accusations of 
intimidation, harassment and official misconduct involving the teen who 
filed the lawsuit.
