Mark English landed Ireland's first medal at the European Indoor Championships as he timed his finish to perfection to take silver in the 800 metres in Prague.

The 21-year-old, a European bronze medallist outdoors last summer, chased down Thijmen Kupers and dipped to cross the line in one minute 47.20 seconds, edging out the Dutchman by 0.05secs. 

Polish race favourite Marcin Lewandowski was the convincing winner in 1:46.67.

English left fans worried he may have left his move too late as Sweden's Andreas Almgren went to the front of the pack.

But as Lewandowski, who finished second four years ago, wrested control the youngster Almgren faded to finish in fourth. 

Meanwhile, English chose his moment well. 

Scotland's Guy Learmonth  to finish last in the field in 1:47.84.
