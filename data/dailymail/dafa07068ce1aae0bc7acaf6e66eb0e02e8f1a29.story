Drivers need to be careful to avoid a concussion when getting in and out of these pint-sized cars.

The Dwarf Car Museum, in Maricopa, Arizona, showcases the life's work of mechanic Ernie Adams.

The 74-year-old, from Walthill, Nebraska, built his first road-legal dwarf car in 1965 - out of nine old refrigerators.

Ernie has made hundreds of dwarf vehicles over the years, from race cars to scaled down replicas of classics like a 1939 Chevy - all of which are fully road legal

Each car is hand-built from scratch and takes between 3,000 and 4,000 hours to complete - and Ernie has been offered as much as $450,000 (£290,000) for them.

He said: 'When I was about 13 years old I saw an old refrigerator laying in the weeds outside our kitchen window and it had an old tire-swing laying up by it and it looked just like a black fender on a white touring-car body.

'I always thought that'd be a neat small car to make. So I got married in 62 and in 1965 I went ahead and built the car that I had in mind out of nine old refrigerators.'

He said: 'People ask me how they ride, I always tell em they ride like a corvette.

'On a good road they ride real smooth, on a rough road they're a little choppy but they all get out and travel highway speeds all day long. I drive them wherever I wanna go just like the family car.'

The miniature car enthusiast is understandably proud of the fact that he builds the cars himself in his backyard - even if people don't always believe him.

Ernie insists that he drives the mini motor cars wherever he wants to go just 'like the family car'

Ernie is deeply attached to his creations and despite several generous offers, he insists the dwarf cars are not for sale.

'I've had lots of offers, I even had a man in California offer to trade me his house, another man tried to trade me a brand new Cadillac,' he said.

'I have been offered anywhere from $50,000 a piece on up to $250,000 and $450,000 for one but they're not for sale and when you get up that high you're just blowing smoke.'

Ernie says that all his miniature cars will get out his yard and will 'travel highway speeds all day long'

Ernie says that whenever people ask he tells them that his miniature motors 'ride like a corvette'

Instead Ernie's sons have set up a museum to let the public view his creations.

Son Kevin said: 'My dad and I was talking one day and he said 'when I'm gone, you guys take the cars and sell em and spend the money however you want to'.

'I told him that I couldn't sell the cars because they were part of our family, so I told him let's just make it a museum, we'll keep all the cars here forever and people can come and see them and we can share them with everybody.'

Ernie and his family chose to start a museum so they could keep the cars but also share them with the public

Ernie says he has had several generous offers for his cars with one man in California offering to trade his house, another man trying to trade him a brand new Cadillac

And while Ernie claims that the current car he is working on will be his last, he says his friends and family remain unconvinced.

He added: 'I'm done building cars right now but I have to finish the last one I'm building.

'Everybody says I'll build another one afterwards and I know as soon as the last one's done I'll get antsy and have to start something, so we'll see.'
