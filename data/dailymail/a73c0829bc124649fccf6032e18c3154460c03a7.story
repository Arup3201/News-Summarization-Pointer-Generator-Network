When he's not treating casualties of the Syrian civil war, ambulance driver Alaa still finds the time and energy to help the lesser-known victims of the conflict.

For he has started his own one-man charitable enterprise by feeding scores of cats that have been orphaned as a result of the war.

Alaa spends around $4 (£2.50) of his savings each day on meat to feed around 150 strays in Masaken Hanano, a neigbourhood in Aleppo.

Dozens of cats have been orphaned or abandoned as a result of shelling by pro-Assad forces during the war

The district has been almost entirely abandoned because of shelling from forces loyal to Syria's president Bashar Al-Assad as they attempt to wrest back control from rebels.

Alaa says he has been feeding and taking care of the cats for over two months.

Aleppo, the country's largest city, has been at the centre of some of the fiercest fighting since a major rebel offensive in July 2012.  

It is thought at least half of the city's population has been displaced as a result of the four-year conflict.

The city is also being encircled by barbaric Islamic State militants who have captured swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq in their bid to create a caliphate across the two countries.

It means the city could see an escalation in fighting if the Islamic fighters make their way into the city.

The West is also intensifying its bombing campaign against the terror group.  

But some Syrians see the U.S-led strikes as serving Assad's interests because they do not target government forces and because some have hit the Nusra Front, Syria's Al Qaeda affiliate that has battled both the Islamic State and the president's forces. 

'All of this is to serve Bashar, and yet people believe the Americans are protecting the Syrians,' said Saad Saad, writing on the same Facebook page.
