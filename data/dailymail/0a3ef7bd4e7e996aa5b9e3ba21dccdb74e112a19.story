A top London university has asked its students to snort cocaine as part of a clinical trial into the effects of the Class A drug.

In an email to hundreds of students sent last week, a professor at King's College London seeks 'healthy male volunteers, 25-40 years of age, to take part in a clinical study involving nasal administration of cocaine'.

The university wants to better understand how the Class A drug effects the body, calling it an 'important scientific study'.

King's College London has asked for volunteers to snort cocaine as part of a clinical study into the effects of the Class A drug

The college is one of the most prestigious in the country and can count 10 Nobel Prize laureates among its alumni

It will not accept volunteers who use the drug recreationally, nor those studying medicine or dentistry, while participants will not be able to cut or dye their hair for 120 days during the study as scientists investigate a wide range of affects the drug has on the body.

Those who are accepted will be given 'reasonable financial compensation' for the time and expenses incurred.

The
email explains the study will mean that: 'After cocaine administration,
repeated biological samples (blood, urine, hair, sweat, oral fluid) 
will be taken to compare and investigate how cocaine and its metabolites
are spread through the human body.'

The
project, which has been approved by London Westminster Research Ethics 
Committee, will be supervised by the clinical toxicology department at 
St Thomas’ Hospital.

A 
spokesman for the university said: 'This is an important scientific 
study to investigate how cocaine and its metabolites are spread through 
the human body.

'All the 
relevant ethical approvals were received for this study. The study will 
be conducted under the highest level of medical supervision in a 
dedicated clinical research suite. Further information about the NHS 
ethical approval process, which was followed, is available on our 
website.'

An estimated 700,000 people in Britain took cocaine last year, making it the second most popular drug after cannabis.

Founded
in 1829 and named to indicate the patronage of King George IV, King’s 
College has about 18,600 full-time students and was ranked the 12th best
university in Europ e in the 2012 Times Higher Education World 
University Rankings.

There are 10 Nobel Prize laureates among King’s alumni and current and former faculty.
