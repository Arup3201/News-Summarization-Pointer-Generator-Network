It's back. The greatest prize in club football, the European Champions League, returns for another glorious season on Tuesday and as ever there's so much to look forward to.

The biggest teams and the biggest stars going head-to-head in the biggest stadiums for the biggest prize on the continent. There really is nothing better.

Here's 10 reasons why we can't wait for the return of Europe's top competition this week.

Who will succeed Real Madrid as champions of Europe this season? 

1. The return of Liverpool

It's been a long five years away for Liverpool and their captain Steven Gerrard admitted to feeling 'jealousy' as rivals Man United, Man City and Chelsea took on the cream of Europe.

But the wait is finally over and the strains of the iconic Champions League anthem will once again ring out at Anfield ahead of their match with Ludogorets Razgard on Tuesday.

For a club with such a proud European pedigree as Liverpool, being away from the Champions League really hurt and they'll be desperate to make up for lost time.

Mario Balotelli is set to lead the Liverpool line against Ludogorets on Tuesday night

Brendan Rodgers has a bold and exciting team to unleash, with Mario Balotelli leading the line ahead of the likes of Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and Lazar Markovic (when he returns from suspension).

There are few things more stirring in football than a big European night at Anfield and they will be worth the wait.

2. Arsenal's British core take on Europe

While Liverpool are making a return, Arsenal are mainstays in the Champions League, about to embark on their 17th consecutive season.

They begin with a tricky trip to Borussia Dortmund and won't be helped by a defensive injury crsis that sees them without Mathieu Debuchy, Nacho Monreal and possibly Calum Chambers.

But they do boast a wonderfully creative attack, with the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain flying the flag for British talent.

Throw in Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil and the Gunners should have the firepower to cause plenty of problems.

They take on Dortmund, Galatasaray and Anderlecht in their group.

3. Chelsea aiming to go one better

It was a case of so near and yet so far for Chelsea as they were beaten by Atletico Madrid in last season's semi-finals.

The lack of a deadly goalscorer proved the downfall of Jose Mourinho's team, but this time it's all very different.

Diego Costa helped Atletico Madrid to victory over Chelsea in last season's Champions League semi-finals

But now Costa is showing excellent form for Chelsea following his £32m summer move

Diego Costa has scored seven goals in four Premier League matches since his £32m move from Atletico and if he can translate that form into European competition, there's no reason why Chelsea can't repeat their 2012 triumph.

Chelsea start their campaign at home to Schalke on Wednesday and a group that also contains Maribor and Sporting Lisbon shouldn't cause too many problems.

4. Champions City with a point to prove

They may have won two Premier League titles out of three but Manchester City haven't yet been able to translate domestic dominance into European success.

When they are confronted with one of the established names, they have struggled. Last season, it was Barcelona. The year before it was Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. The year before that Bayern Munich.

City need star striker Sergio Aguero to deliver the goals if they are to improve in the Champions League

And as a result, they once again find themselves in a tough group with Bayern, Roma and CSKA Moscow, travelling to the Allianz Arena first up on Wednesday.

It's time for City to perform and get to the latter stages and they undoubtedly have the quality to get there.

5. Real's Galacticos - Part II

They ended an agonising 12-year wait for a Champions League crown last season and now Real Madrid are hungry for more.

Having secured the much-coveted Decima triumph on an unforgettable night in Lisbon back in May, Real start their pursuit of No 11 at home to Basle on Tuesday night.

They look an even more formidable proposition this time round, with James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos the latest Galacticos to join Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.

It's actually been quote a shaky start to the season for Carlo Ancelotti's men, with league defeats already to Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid.

They will hope the Champions League will provide the kick-start they need.

6. Barcelona's awesome forward line

Barcelona also have the Champions League firmly in their sights having strengthened their attacking options with the purchase of Luis Suarez.

As we all know, Suarez won't be available until the matchday four trip to Ajax but his goalscoring talents could prove the difference between success and failure in the latter stages.

However with their midfield packed with plenty of Champions League nous and Lionel Messi and Neymar up front, Barca have plenty to go on.

They start their quest for a first Champions League title since 2011 when they play APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday, with two tantalising games with Paris Saint-Germain to come.

7. Bayern's stars on top of the world

Having been embarrassed by Real Madrid in last season's semi-finals, Bayern Munich find themselves with something to prove on the European stage.

But at least their German stars have that winning feeling - Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm, Mario Gotze, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller helped win the World Cup over the summer.

With genuine challenges likely to be few and far between in their domestic league, Bayern will set their sights on European glory and they have an amazing team.

Pep Guardiola already has two Champions League wins as a manager - he'd dearly like to make it three.

8. Familiar faces

The Champions League is a constellation of stars and many of them we know very well from the Premier League.

Former Chelsea and Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas will be leading Zenit St Petersburg into action against Benfica, Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen in Group C.

Dimitar Berbatov will spearhead the Monaco attack on their return to the Champions League for the first time since 2005-2006.

And Man City will come up against a familiar foe in Ashley Cole when they take on Roma.

9. The minnows

The elite invariably grab the headlines in the Champions League but let's not forget some of the lesser lights taking part.

Nobody could have scripted Ludogorets' qualification play-off victory over Steaua Bucharest as defender Cosmin Moti donned the goalkeeper's gloves to make two vital saves in a penalty shoot-out and secure their progress.

Cypriots APOEL Nicosia will visit Barcelona, PSG and Ajax as they compete in the Champions League group phase for only the second time, while Maribor of Slovenia are also making their second appearance at this stage.

10. It is the best of football

Whoever's playing, the Champions League is a byword for top quality football and unmissable drama. The competition throws the world's biggest clubs and world class stars week-in week-out and it's wonderful to have it back again.
