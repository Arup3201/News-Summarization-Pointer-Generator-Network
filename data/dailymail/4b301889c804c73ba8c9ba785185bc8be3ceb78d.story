Roger Federer went through all the emotions of a five-set thriller while cheering on Switzerland against Argentina at the World Cup from his Wimbledon base.

The SW19 fourth seed made it home in time to watch his country take on Lionel Messi and co after a straightforward 6-1 6-4 6-4 win over Tommy Robredo on Wimbledon's No 1.

And he cowered under a blanket on the sofa as he watched the tense last-16 clash that was decided by Angel Di Maria's winner with just three minutes left of extra time.

Bag of nerves: Federer pulls the blanket over his head as he watches Argentina beat Switzerland

Disappointment: But Federer was proud of his country's national football team in their last-16 tie

Federer was backing his nation to secure a surprise win over the Argentines, but also managed to catch a glimpse of potential Wimbledon semi final opponent Nick Kyrgios' shock 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 win over Rafael Nadal in a break of play.

And although Switzerland crashed out of the tournament, Federer did get some commiserations from world number eight Juan Martin Del Porto, who tweeted: 'Your boys did a great match but... good luck in Wimbledon haha :)'.

Commiserations: Argentine tennis player Del Potro sent his best wishes to Federer post match

Support: Federer was backing his nation from the start of the game against the South Americans

Easy: Federer beat Tommy Robredo on Wimbledon's Court No 1 earlier in the day

Slice: Federer's win was straightforward - unlike Switzerland's defeat to Argentina
