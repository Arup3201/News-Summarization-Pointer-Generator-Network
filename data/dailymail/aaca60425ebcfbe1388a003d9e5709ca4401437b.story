Seven-year-old Nathan Smith was killed following a collision with a van last night in Middlesborough

A seven-year-old boy has died after a collision with a van last night.   

Nathan Smith had just got off the bus with his mother and a sibling at 6.40pm when he was knocked over by a Peugeot 206 van.

The boy, from Lingdale, East Cleveland, suffered serious injuries and was taken by ambulance to James Cook University Hospital but died a short time later.

The driver of the van, a 22-year-old 
male, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving 
and has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

The collision occurred in Boosbeck High Street near Church Drive in East Cleveland.

Roads in the immediate area were closed for a short time to allow emergency services access and for investigation work to begin.

Police
are appealing for any witnesses, particularly from any passengers on 
the 4B Arriva bus to Skelton who may have seen what happened.

Anyone with information should contact the Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit on 101.
