Matthew Upson is closing in on finally making his debut for Leicester.

The veteran defender joined the Foxes on a free transfer from Brighton at the start of July, only to suffer a foot injury soon after.

The former Arsenal, West Ham and Stoke man came close to making a return to action in early December but suffered a setback which has kept him out for several more weeks.

The 35-year-old is again back in training, with the likelihood of an appearance in February if all goes well as boss Nigel Pearson feels he will be a valuable asset.

Pearson said: 'Hopefully we will get him back on the pitch next week in an Under 21s game if possible and we'll go from there.

'When he has trained with us he has been great, and I'll be delighted to have him available.

'His experience and game understanding is a quality sometimes people underplay.

'What is important is when players get older they are less able to do things physically, so you need to compensate with a bit of know how, and he certainly has that.'
