Under threat: British dairy products and the farms which produce them are under threat from cheap, often poor quality, foreign imports

Every day for the past three decades, Sue and Tom Flowers have risen at 4.45am to begin milking their 500 Holstein Friesian cows on their 370-acre dairy farm near Buxton, Derbyshire.

They do not finish tending to them until 10.30pm.

‘Cows don’t allow you to take a rest,’ says Sue. ‘We work 365 days a year.’

Tom, 65, and Sue, 52, took over Old House Farm from Tom’s father 30 years ago. With the help of their son Edward, 26, they produce 7,000 litres of milk a day, which is sold to a nearby dairy processor and distributed to retailers around the country.

The couple hope Edward will continue the family business when they retire. But they are worried. Despite putting in 18-hour days, Sue and Tom are struggling. They receive 33¼p per litre of milk — which, says Sue, is barely enough to cover the cost of producing it.

‘We scrimp and save, mend and make do, but I don’t know why we should be under such pressure,’ she says.

Such is the situation faced by thousands of British dairy farmers. Two decades of relentless price slashing by supermarkets has seen them unable to break even — let alone earn a living. In 2012, the average dairy farm was losing around £40,000 a year.  

Sue has seen dozens of her friends in the farming community simply give up and seek a different way of making a living. The number of dairy farms has plummeted from more than 34,000 in 1996 to just over 10,000 today.

British dairy products are being replaced by cheap, often poor quality, foreign imports. As recently as 2008, Britain was entirely self-sufficient in dairy produce. Now, British-produced goods account for only 80 per cent of the market. Some  £2.6 billion worth of dairy products are imported annually.

And, to the horror of farmers, things are about to get worse. Last Monday, Tesco — which has seen its profits tumble, faced with competition from budget stores Aldi and Lidl — fired the opening salvo in a supermarket price war that is almost certain to see milk prices falling again.

The grocery giant announced it would be cutting the price of its four-pint (2.27 litres) milk bottles by an unprecedented 39p, from £1.39 to £1. The price of a six-pint (3.41 litres) bottle of milk is down from £1.99 to £1.48.

The move brings it into line with Asda, Aldi and Lidl, which have sold four pints of milk at £1 for more than a year. It also means milk at Tesco is cheaper than many mineral waters.

This sounds like good news for the consumer — but only in the short term. Farmers fear it could eventually spell the end of the British dairy industry.

To Sue Flowers, the news was a slap in
 the face. ‘They are trying to devalue a wholesome product,’ she says. 
‘It makes me livid.’

'They are trying to devalue a wholesome product': Tom and Sue Flowers, who run a Dairy farm in Friden, Derbyshire, are 'livid' at Tesco's decision to slash the price of its milk to just 25p a pint

When announcing the cut, Tesco proudly declared that its suppliers wouldn’t suffer. The supermarket gets its own-brand milk from a select group of 650 farmers, who will still be paid above the cost of production. For the other 9,000-odd dairy farmers in Britain, however, such assurances offer little comfort.

‘They claim it won’t affect us, but it’s a lie,’ says David Handley, a dairy farmer from Monmouthshire, who chairs the grassroots Farmers For Action campaign. ‘Every other retailer will want to follow suit.’

Though Tesco farmers may be insulated, the majority of dairy farmers — around 75 per cent — don’t belong to price-guaranteed pools. They sell directly to processors, who set their prices according to what retailers will pay.

‘The whole supply chain will come under pressure,’ says Mansel Raymond, chair of the National Farmers Union milk board. ‘Soon, someone will come along and try to undercut Tesco.’

Sure enough, on Tuesday Sainsbury’s also slashed the price of four pints from £1.39 to £1. The Co-operative cut the price of one and two-pint bottles to 45p and 85p. On Friday, Waitrose — having insisted it had no plans to cut milk prices — reduced four-pint bottles from £1.39 to £1 for customers with a mywaitrose card.

Morrisons, meanwhile, undercut them all by reducing two-litre cartons of Meadow Park milk — equivalent to just over 3.5 pints — from 97p to 84p (meaning it costs around 24p a pint).

How long until every retailer in Britain does the same? And how long before Tesco tries to gain the commercial edge again by cutting its price further?

Race to the bottom: Sainsbury's responded to Tesco's price cut by slashing its milk prices to match, while Morrisons went further and cut the price of its milk to the equivalent of 24p a pint

It’s the latest chapter in a struggle that began in 1994, when the Milk Marketing Board, which had previously set milk prices according to production costs, was abolished.

The move shifted power away from farmers and into the hands of supermarkets, who began demanding ever-cheaper produce.

Whereas in 1997 dairy farmers were receiving 25p per litre of milk, by 2006 it was 17p per litre — 4p less than the 21p cost of making it. By 2010, it was back up to around 25p per litre, but 5p below the cost of production.

As a result, consumers developed a growing — and, say farmers, unrealistic — expectation that milk should be available cheaply.

Some warned that the only way for the British dairy industry to survive would be to go the way of the U.S., and reorganise farms into so-called ‘mega farms’, where thousands of animals are reared indoors and production costs are lower.

Already, cows are suffering. The average yield per cow has more than doubled in the past 40 years. In 2012, British cows produced an average of 7,604 litres each during their ten-month lactation — nearly 1,000 more than ten years ago.  

This increased demand places the animals under physical strain. Over-milking can result in disease and infection and shorten their working lives.

Whereas dairy cows can live up to 20-25 years, producing milk for 15 years, today the average British cow has just three years of milking, and is then sent to slaughter.

Meanwhile, with more than two dairy farms going out of business every day in Britain, farming has one of the highest suicide rates of any profession.

Suffering: The average yield per cow has more than doubled in the past 40 years, an increased strain that places the animals under strain, resulting in disease and infection and shortening their working lives

But the supermarkets haven’t suffered. Their average gross margin — the difference between the price they sell milk for, and the price they pay farmers or milk processors — is estimated to be more than 30 per cent.

Little wonder farmers have begun taking matters into their own hands. In July 2012, more than 2,000 took part in protests around the country, blockading milk-processing plants and disrupting supermarket supplies.

Ironically, until Tesco’s latest move, it appeared their action might have paid off.

Following the protests, the then farming minister Jim Paice drew up a ‘voluntary code of conduct’ for processors allowing farmers to terminate contracts if they could no longer afford to produce at the price offered.

A number of supermarkets established ‘pools’ of dedicated milk suppliers to whom they guaranteed the cost of production — an approach pioneered by Marks & Spencer in 2000.

Several processors, including Arla Foods, which supplies Morrisons, and Muller Wiseman, which supplies Sainsbury’s, increased the price paid to farmers.

With the cost of production at around 28-30p per litre, the average farmer was, by the start of this year, receiving around 31p per litre.

Given that the average farm produces around a million litres a year, that works out at a household income of £10,000 — not even the minimum wage, but an improvement on recent years.

The fact that Tesco’s price cut should come at the moment when, for the first time in more than a decade, dairy producers had reason to be optimistic only makes it harder to swallow.

For some, the writing is already on the wall. For example, this is the first year Peter and Youleite Parks won’t be producing any milk on their second-generation farm in Surrey.

Having worked 12 hours day, seven days a week for more than a decade, they have given up after what Youleite, 59, describes as ‘years of not making a penny’, and are selling off their dairy cows one by one.
