A tiny Yorkshire Terrier dumped in a wheelie bin almost died before it was found by a refuge collector, frantically trying to scramble out.

The adorable dog was put out with the rubbish overnight in Wigan, Lancashire, after its owner reportedly claimed it was already dead.

The RSPCA is investigating after the pet was found desperately clambering up the side of the bin in freezing temperatures the next morning by a waste collector for Wigan Council.

One neighbour who saw the dog being found said: 'A lot of people around here are upset about this.

'You could see the poor dog trying to scramble up the side of the bin trying to get out.

'I just couldn't comprehend what was happening, it was unbelievable.'

Another neighbour added: 'I just can't bear to imagine if the binman hadn't found the poor thing.

'Apparently the owners thought it was dead but even if it was you don't put a dog in a bin.'

Local Labour councillor Jeanette Prescott added: 'I'm horrified. I don't understand the mentality of these people if they can do something like that.

'I just feel sorry for the little dog, I hope he survives and gets re-homed and sees what a loving family can be like.

'And I hope these people are never allowed to have a dog again, they certainly don't deserve it - they should be ashamed of themselves.'

The Yorkshire Terrier is now being cared for by staff at Leigh Cats and Dogs Home while investigations are under way.

Terry Dunn, director of environment at Wigan Council, said: 'The dog was in a distressed state.

'Our staff recovered the animal and alerted the council's dog control officer.

'The owner, who claimed she believed the dog was dead, was warned by council staff that this is a serious case of animal mistreatment.

'We have informed the RSPCA who deal with animal welfare matters.'
