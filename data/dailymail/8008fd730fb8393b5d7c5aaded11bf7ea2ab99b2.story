The Florida Department of Health has reported its first case of Enterovirus 68 - the life-threatening respiratory illness that has now hospitalized 628 people across 44 states.

The 10-year-old girl from Polk County was diagnosed with the deadly illness and spent six days at Tampa General Hospital before being sent home to recover.

Jennifer Dunn told ABC Action News on Tuesday she believes her daughter Harleigh was the child with the illness, which carries symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sneezing and body aches.

Harleigh, who is now recovering at home, has long suffered from asthma but was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital when she struggled breathing early last month.

'It was difficult to breathe,' Harleigh told ABC Action News.

Her mother added: 'This is the worst I've ever, ever seen her. We almost lost her and that's something I think about every day.'

She spent six days in hospital and missed two weeks of school but has now returned and doctors have said she is not contagious.

Her doctor has not yet given confirmation it was her but the facts match up, Jennifer Dunn said.

Others have not survived the disease.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said four people with the disease have died nationwide, although it is not yet clear what role it played in their deaths.

In total, 628 people from 44 states and the District of Columbia have been affected, the CDC said. The majority of the cases are believed to be children. 

Recovering: The girl smiles for the camera after recovering at home following six days in the hospital. The illness has spread to nearly every state and hospitalized more than 600 people

Only Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and Alaska have not seen any cases.

The illness has flu and cold-like symptoms and can cause difficulty breathing for infants and young children, officials have said.

The disease can spread through droplets in coughs or sneezes or when someone touches a contaminated surface, such as a countertop or doorknob, according to the Florida Department of Health.

Officials said the best way to prevent the disease spreading is by keeping good hygiene such as washing hands and disinfecting surfaces.'

Those having cold-like or flu-like symptoms should stay home from child care centers, school or work and, if possible, remain apart from other family members,' Dr. Celeste Philip, deputy secretary for health, said, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Four of those infected with the virus have died, including four-year-old Eli Waller, who died last month, according to the Mercer County Medical Examiner's Office in New Jersey.

Eli was asymptomatic before his death and the onset of his illness was rapid, according to Hamilton Township Health Officer Jeff Plunkett said.

The youngster had stayed home from preschool on September 24 with a case pink eye that the medical examiner found to be unrelated to the virus. That night, he died in his sleep.

Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital and was known to have the illness. 

The Rhode Island child's death was the result of a bacterial infection, Staphylococcus aureus, that hit the girl in tandem with the virus, Rhode Island officials said in a statement.

This enterovirus germ is not new. It was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before.

Victims: Four-year-old Eli Waller, left, died last month from the illness in New Jersey, while 10-year-old Emily Ortando also had it when she passed away in September. She had a bacterial infection at the same time

Because it's not routinely tested for, it may have spread widely in previous years without being identified in people who just seemed to have a cold.

This year, the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses.

Beginning last month, hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago received a flood of children with trouble breathing. Some needed oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many, but not all, had asthma before the infection.

Health officials say they have not detected a recent mutation or other change in the virus that would cause it to become more dangerous.
