Rona Fairhead: The new chairman of the BBC Trust, pictured, has warned the corporation not to become too 'high and mighty'

The new chairman of the BBC Trust has warned the corporation not to become too 'high and mighty', and distanced herself from her predecessors by promising she won't 'gloss over' its faults.

Rona Fairhead used her first speech as chairman of the BBC's governing body to urge television bosses to 'challenge themselves', and warned them that she would not become the Corporation's 'cheerleader'.

'I'm not someone to gloss over the BBC's faults, problems or challenges – I see it as part of my job to identify and pursue them,' she said.

In doing so, the 53-year old executive distanced herself from her predecessors Lord Patten and Sir Michael Lyons, who were accused of being too 'cosy' with the BBC's executives and becoming blind to the Corporation's faults.

Mrs Fairhead also admitted in her inaugural address that the Corporation needs to become more 'agile', and vowed to consult the public on what shape it should take in the future, rather than leaving decisions to a 'small elite'.

'[There needs to be] a very real debate about the future, size and shape of the BBC….and I believe it needs to be a proper public debate, not one conducted by a small elite,' she said.

'The debate must include the voices of all the people out there who pay for the BBC, who love its programmes, who are its true owners.'

Mrs Fairhead's comments come as the BBC prepares for its next Charter Review, in 2016, when the corporation will effectively negotiate its future funding.

BBC acolytes insist that the corporation must be kept intact. However, many of the BBC's critics have argued that it should be shrunk, for example by cutting back on its in-house production unit or local news services.

Mrs Fairhead, who was finance director of Pearson before she joined the BBC Trust, admitted that the Corporation may need to shrink but added that it does not need to become 'much' smaller.

However, she used a story about her son to warn the Corporation not to become too complacent. 

She told television executives in London that she had once returned home from a conference 'feeling rather pleased' with herself, only to see he had loaded a screen-saver onto her computer, with the slogan: 'High and mighty. Just because you're at the top doesn't mean you're useful'.

'It was a good challenge. Everyone – and I include in that every organisation – needs to challenge itself from time to time. And because the BBC is paid for by the public, that challenge needs to take form of a wider debate,' she said.

She added that the BBC should do more to cooperate with other media groups, for example by sharing content.

'The BBC has to show that it can be more open and collaborative – while respecting its editorial position. It should do more sharing of IP and content, get better at linking and attribution,' she said.

'Clearly the BBC is a major market intervention and, while it needs to serve all licence fee payers, it also needs to be sensitive to commercial players operating in the UK market.'

In recent years, the BBC has come under heavy fire over its free-to-access local news websites, which have helped to accelerate the decline of commercially run newspaper operations in those areas.

'We need a vibrant press as part of a healthy democracy and the public deserve a choice of providers,' Mrs Fairhead said.
