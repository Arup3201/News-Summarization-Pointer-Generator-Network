New Mum: Laura Holmes, 21, explained to Good Morning Britain viewers how she was left scarred for life after being mauled by her friend's dog

A young mum whose face was left 'hanging off' after being mauled by a close friend's dog today vowed to sue the owner for thousands of pounds in compensation.

Laura Holmes said she was unable to look in the mirror after the attack by the American Akita dog left her scarred for life.

The 21-year-old needed 60 stitches after the nine-year-old beast, called Koda, jumped at her and tore chunks of flesh from her mouth and cheek.

The dog's owner Tracie Taylor, 49, become the first in Britain to be prosecuted under tough new laws after failing to control the seven stone Akita. 

Miss Holmes has instructed an injury lawyers in a bid to get compensation for the attack, which left her fearing for the life of her unborn child.

Today she recalled the ordeal, that happened when she was seven months pregnant, as she appeared on the Good Morning Britain sofa.

She told Kate Garraway and Ben Shephard that she was replying to a text message when the mutt pounced at a pal's home.

Miss Holmes said leading up to the attack Koda was 'fine' and 'walking around like he normally does.'

'I went upstairs and I was in the middle of replying (to a text message),' she said.

'The dog was walking around and I think he looked out of the window.

'The next thing I knew the dog was right on my face, literally on top of me.'

Miss Holmes explained to the ITV presenters' that she pulled the  beast off before it sunk it's teeth into her arm.

'Everything was up in the air, I was just trying to get the dog off my arm.

'When I went to escape the dog clutched my leg.

'I hit it with this leg (her right leg).

'I'm not really horrible to dogs but you'll do anything to get them off.'

The heavily pregnant young woman explained that she broke free and escaped the bedroom racing to a nearby bathroom.

Recovery: Laura Holmes has had significant re-constructive surgery but admits she can't look in the mirror

'The door was shut already,' she said.

'I opened the door, went to turn around to hide my bump behind the door, and the next thing I knew the dog was there trying to get into the bathroom at me. 

'I got my left arm stuck in the door.

'I just kept pushing the door, I wasn't bothered about my arm, I just kept pushing the door.

'I didn't want it to do any more damage.

'I know it had done quite a lot, but I didn't want it to do any more, not go for my stomach.

'The door finally shut and it was just relief.'

Dangerous: This is Koda, the American Akita who attacked Laura Holmes. It was destroyed shortly after the attack and it emerged it had already bitten someone else four years earlier

Painful: Miss Holmes also has the scars from the attack all over her body, including her arms

Miss Holmes, from Nottingham, was rushed to Queen's Medical Centre, where surgeons battled to save her face and her baby.

She had to give birth to baby Nathaniel - now 15 weeks old - by C-section because doctors felt she may not be able to withstand the pain of a natural birth due to her injuries.

Irresponsible dog owners who allow their dog to attack people or assistance dogs will face tougher prison sentences from today.

Changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act will also mean dog owners can now face prosecution if their dog attacks a person in their home or on any private property, except if they attack a trespasser.

The maximum sentences for allowing a dog to attack someone have also been substantially increased.

The maximum prison sentences in England and Wales are now:

Up to 14 years, from two years, for a fatal dog attack.

Up to five years, from two years, for injury.

Up to three years if an assistance dog is attacked.  

The new mum said her son had been left unaffected by the ordeal and 'doesn't know anything different.'

In a landmark prosecution, the dog's owner, Tracie Taylor, received a 16-week jail sentence suspended for a year and was ordered to pay Laura just £1000 in compensation.

Under new laws changed on May 13 - just a day before Laura was left with life-changing injuries - owners can be taken to court if the animal is dangerous and out of control. 

The dog, Koda, was destroyed shortly after the attack when Taylor, also from Nottingham, surrendered it to police and she has also been banned from owning any animals in the future. 

Miss Holmes is due to have further facial surgery in December but is still struggling to eat and drink after the assault. 

Injury lawyer Julie Walker, of Nelsons Solicitors, who is representing Miss Holmes, said: “It is clear that, through no fault of her own, this woman was savagely at-tacked by a dog which we now know had carried out a brutal attack of this nature previously.

“Laura was pregnant when this attack happened and feared not only for her own life but also that of her unborn child.

“She has been incredibly brave but still faces a very protracted and lengthy rehabilitation ahead of her, with further reconstructive surgery planned in the new year.

“Appearance and image is hugely important, particularly to a 21-year-old girl.

“Even the mirrors in her maternity room were covered by nursing staff, who were conscious of her psychological state.

“She has only been out of her house alone on a couple of occasions since the attack happened earlier this year.”

The attack meant Laura, of Nottingham, had to have extensive emergency corrective surgery while 29 weeks pregnant. 

She said: “Being told that you could die, as well as your child, was too terrible to contemplate.

“I am slowly but surely improving and trying to be the best mum I can be for Nathaniel.

“I don’t think the compensation was enough, but what is?

“No amount of money can make up for this.

“I could not look in the mirror for about eight weeks. My confidence has now completely gone and I don’t know if it will come back.”
