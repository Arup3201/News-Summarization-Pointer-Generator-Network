Astronomical: One call to a 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £5 a minute

Looking through my latest mobile phone bill, I almost had a cardiac arrest. It was three times the usual amount — all thanks to one item. 

A call I’d made to a 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £5 a minute.

And because I’d then got them to put me through, the total cost of the 26-minute call had come to £137.08, including VAT.

Spluttering with shock, I contacted Vodafone, my mobile phone service provider, and asked how on earth they could justify this.

A very apologetic lady explained that I had called ‘the wrong directory inquiries number’. Maybe I’m naive, but I hadn’t been aware that there could be a ‘wrong’ directory inquiries number.

She explained that instead of calling Vodafone’s own service on 118 881, I had called the directory of Orange — another service provider — on 118 000.

I explained that this was a totally innocent mistake. I had probably done so because I had dialled out of habit, having been an Orange customer some years ago until I switched to Vodafone.

I’d been looking for the number of Sky TV customer services because my parents’ digibox had developed a fault on Christmas Eve.

In any case, how is anyone supposed to accurately remember all these 118 inquiries numbers when they’re all so similar?

Of course, with hindsight, I realised that I could have scribbled down the number, hung up, and then dialled it myself. That way I would have been charged at a standard call rate when talking to Sky. But when in a hurry or on the move, it can seem so much easier just to be put straight through.

The woman at Vodafone sounded very sympathetic. She said she understood my distress but, unfortunately, Orange had charged Vodafone an inflated price and so Vodafone had to pass the cost on to me.

If I had rung Vodafone directory inquiries on 118 881, it would have been 71p a minute.

There didn’t seem to be any way of arguing with this. So I sighed, thanked her and resolved never to call a 118 number again, just in case I got the wrong one.

But something was still nagging me, so the next day I decided to call Orange.

They were adamant that the £5 a minute was nothing to do with them: they had not set the high charge for my call, Vodafone had.

Orange’s charge for their directory service was £1.29 a minute, they said. In other words, the true cost of my call to Orange directory inquiries was nearer £34.

So, with a bit of mental arithmetic, I worked out that when Vodafone charged me £137.08 for calling a rival firm’s directory, they had made a pure profit on that call of almost exactly £100. Yet Vodafone continued to insist the £5 a minute charge was not their fault.

I asked them how much they had profited from my call. A spokeswoman said: ‘We pay the service provider (Orange directories) according to commercial agreements and we cannot share this information.’

Over the next few days, I went back and forth between Orange and Vodafone, repeatedly being told by both that the charges I had incurred were the fault of the other.

By now it wasn’t the size of the astronomical bill that I was angry about, it was the childish, manipulative and downright disingenuous behaviour of the phone companies.

While Vodafone appeared to be the culprit in this case, I started to suspect that they were all in this together, setting complicated pricing structures that were impossible for the consumer to interpret.

When I looked at Vodafone’s website, there was a list of their charges for 118 numbers but there was no mention of what they charged for Orange’s 118 000. The biggest charge they admitted to was £2.71 a minute if a Vodafone customer rang BT’s 118 500.

Complex: When Vodafone charged £137.08 for calling a rival firm’s directory, they had made a pure profit on that call of almost exactly £100. Yet Vodafone continued to insist the £5 a minute charge was not their fault

So I contacted Vodafone’s head office and said I was giving them one last chance to come clean about whether £5 a minute was their standard charge for a call by their customers to Orange directories. And, if it was, where was this charge published, as the industry regulations require?

And at that point, the firm admitted: ‘We’re very sorry, but £5 a minute is our charge. We don’t know why you were told it wasn’t. It must have been human error.’

At last! It had taken me two weeks to establish who had really profited from my call to 118 000.

A spokeswoman for Orange — when I eventually got hold of them — said: ‘It is the carrier’s decision on what rates they set. In this case, Vodafone has set the rate at £5 for a call to the Orange 118 000 directory inquiries for its customers. We can confirm that this is not the rate set by Orange.’

Only the most persistent person — one like me — would have bothered getting to the bottom of this scandal. But what chance does the average customer have of being able to navigate such a system?

In fact, the 118 system is so complex and so complained-about that the regulator Ofcom is set to overhaul it. From July, phone companies will not be able to hide their 118 charges as easily, or levy complex rates where the true cost to the consumer is hidden. A big part of the problem is that there are two different elements to these calls: the cost that all the different directory inquiry companies, with their own call centres often in different countries, charge you for their services; and the cost your phone provider, like Vodafone, charges you to access them.

At the moment, if you unwittingly dial the wrong number and use a directory service which isn’t your own phone provider’s, that second element — the ‘access charge’ — can be extortionate.

And, as I found out, it is very difficult to find out how much it is. But, under the new rules, phone companies will have to publish prominently what you have to pay, and furthermore, the extra charge will have to be exactly the same for all the different directory inquiry services they allow you to access.

The idea is that if customers know and understand what they are being charged, competition will drive the cost down.

They will have to make it clear, for example: ‘Calls cost 1.20p per minute plus your phone company’s access charge.’

I’m still not convinced this is simple enough for customers to find out the total cost of the call as it will appear on their bill. After all, you would still need to contact your provider or check your contract to ascertain the access charge. But Ofcom insist it will be an improvement. If so, then it is about time.

The 118 swindle is all the more disappointing for the customer because the proliferation of these phone firms was supposed to be a great liberation of the market and drive down prices.

But as with the electricity and gas firms, deregulation has not brought the promised savings.

In fact, if anything, it has allowed the phone companies to drive up prices. Indeed, it makes one long for the old days when there was just one BT number to dial for directory inquiries.

When that old 192 number, costing a mere 40p a minute, was abolished in 2003 and the industry opened up to competition, 118 was made the new prefix for all the new services.

Those who worked for Oftel (Ofcom’s predecessor as regulator), which brought in the change, would no doubt now claim this was a mistake rather than a conspiracy. Perhaps no one could have envisaged how phone companies would exploit the system.

In practice, though, it has meant that customers have ended up so confused about which 118 number to dial without racking up enormous charges that, increasingly, they have had no choice but to avoid all of them.

No wonder the number of calls to directory inquiries has fallen by an estimated 80 per cent in a decade.

An Ofcom spokesman said: ‘We want to make the cost of calling 118 numbers clearer for telephone users. Under the changes which come into effect this summer, call charges will be split so consumers can compare the cost of calling different 118 services, and see where their money is going.’

Even so, trying to tie down who is responsible for charging what for which service, with prices changing all the time, remains virtually impossible.
