A horrific video that shows a malfunctioning lift shooting up and slowly crushing a student to death as he steps inside has gone viral in China.

The young man, who could not move away quickly enough as the lift jerked upwards, is caught between the floor of the lift and the top of the door, where he is crushed to death.

The video footage is from a surveillance camera fixed inside the malfunctioning lift at Huaqiao University, in the city of Xiamen in south-east China's Fujian Province.

The unnamed man was said to be an architecture student from the university who was standing at the front of a small group of people when the doors opened and he went to step inside

The three-minute video clip of the incident, which was one of the most widely shared items on social media throughout China yesterday, shows the last minutes of the student's life as his body jerks from a lack of oxygen.

The as yet unnamed man was said to be an architecture student from the university who was standing at the front of a small group of people when the doors opened.

Another student also at the scene said that the pair were waiting for the lift on the third floor. The doors opened and the lift started to move as the victim stepped inside.

He told local media that the young man seemed more surprised than worried as the lift started to rise upwards. 

He had not had time to react when it suddenly slammed him into the top of the lift's doorframe, trapping his upper torso and left leg in the left, while the rest of his body dangled outside.
