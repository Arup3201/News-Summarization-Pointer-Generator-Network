Should Roy Hodgson stay on as England manager?

Roy Hodgson should not remain in charge of England after their worst World Cup since 1958, say 68 per cent in Sportsmail's online poll.

England's two defeats, losing 2-1 to Italy before being beaten by the same scoreline to Uruguay, means the Three Lions won't get out of Group D.

Costa Rica's 1-0 win over Italy on Friday was the final nail in England's World Cup coffin, but FA chairman Greg Dyke has assured Hodgson that he will remain in charge.

When asked whether Hodgson would remain manager until his contract runs out at the end of the 2016 European Championships in France, Dyke said: 'That is the view of myself, of everybody else here (in Brazil) and of others in the FA.

'We're supportive of Roy Hodgson, we've asked him to stay as manager.

'Roy has done a good job and it was always an approach for four years and we hope to do better in the European Championship.

'We do not see any value in changing.'

It has struck a nerve with the majority of supporters.

One, because they feel Hodgson should be cut loose. Two, because they think Dyke is using upcoming tournaments to deflect from England's current World Cup disappointment.

Dyke, who infamously made the cut-throat gesture once England were drawn in Group D, stretched as far as looking towards the 2022 World Cup.

'There is a real chance that we can develop and win in 2022,' he said. 'That is the aim.'

Hodgson has also refused to quit his post, and thinks it is not necessary for him to leave after falling at the first hurdle.

'I don't have any intention to resign,' he said.

'I'm bitterly disappointed, of course, but I don't feel I need to resign, no.'

The Three Lions face Costa Rica on Tuesday to bring Group D to a close, and can become the first England team in history to lose all three games in a World Cup qualifying group.

Sportsmail's poll attracted 6,536 votes - 4,428 said Hodgson should go while 2,108 want him to stay.
