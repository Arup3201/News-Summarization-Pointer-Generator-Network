Chelsea defender Filipe Luis believes Chelsea's 1-1 draw against Burnley cannot be blamed on the performance of referee Martin Atkinson.

Jose Mourinho lamented his side's bad luck after the Premier League clash which could have seen Chelsea awarded two penalties before Nemanja Matic was sent off for a push on Ashley Barnes. 

Luis, however, claimed Chelsea simply couldn't make the most of the chances they created at Stamford Bridge.

The studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Chelsea star Nemanja Matic and his manager  Mourinho

He told the Telegraph: 'I don't believe in luck and I don't want to talk about the referee.

'We had chances to win the game [against Burnley], we played a lot better than them and created a lot of chances. We have to improve and play better in every game.

'We created chances, everybody was running in attack. We have to know that every game is not easy, and to be top of the league every game is more difficult because everybody is trying to steal points from us.

'Now we have to work hard and train more, improve every day.'

Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final

After Chelsea's game against Burnley, Jose Mourinho listed four minutes; four key incidents that he believed the referee had got wrong. Here, Sportsmail looks at them: 

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes.

33 - Ivanovic goes for goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. It should have been a Chelsea penalty.

43 - Diego Costa goes to ground after  Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. It could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been  soft.

69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. It was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.
