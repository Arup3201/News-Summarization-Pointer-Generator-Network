As our future Queen, many would forgive Kate for treating herself to a new designer outfit every time she had to make a public appearance.

But the Duchess of Cambridge is far cleverer than that. She has no desire to be seen as a mere clothes horse - and frequently recycles outfits she has worn at previous high profile events to show the public that she is not frittering the public purse away on endless designer clothes.

Yes, she spends a certain amount on clothes from top designers - but she'll wear the items again and again - just as the Queen does, or notoriously thrifty Princess Anne, who regularly brings out a dress she first wore 40 years ago.

And for yesterday's Wimbledon appearance, Kate did just that. She chose a £1,100 cable knit Alexander McQueen dress she had worn a year ago to the day, during the North American tour she and William embarked upon last summer.

2011 The Duchess first wore the dress exactly a year ago to the day - with the same LK Bennett shoes

It was their first official Royal tour as husband and wife, and Kate's wardrobe was under the microscope.

She wore the dress on the fourth of July 2011, for a visit to Canada's Prince Edward Island.

It caused a stir among fashion cognoscenti at the time, given that it was a six-year-old dress - ancient in fashion terms - from the 2006 collection by Alexander McQueen, the same fashion house behind her wedding dress.

Not only was it 12 seasons old, but it had been worn by another high profile star, Sarah Jessica Parker, who was photographed in the navy version in the year of its release.

But Kate, who teamed the dress with the same £165 blue suede LK Bennett pumps she had on yesterday,  wore it with panache.

The dress was just one of a series of impeccable choices on that trip - and one of the few items from that time we have seen again since.

The tour was seen a great success, and it sealed the status of the new couple as the thoroughly modern, entirely likeable, popular new face of the monarchy - so it is no wonder that Kate has a fondness for this dress. 

The
£1,1000 Alexander McQueen cable knit dress comes from the British design 
house's 2006 collection - when the late founder Alexander McQueen was 
still at the helm.

Sarah
 Jessica Parker wore the style the year it was shown on the catwalk, 
while Kate caused a stir in the fashion world when she wore it a full 
six years afterwards.

It
 was exactly a year ago yesterday that she wore the McQueen garment - on a 
visit to Prince Edward Island last year during the tour of Canada she 
embarked upon with William just a few months after the Royal Wedding.

A familiar style: Kate wore the dress exactly a 
year ago today - with the same navy suede LK Bennett pumps she is 
wearing today - while actress Sarah Jessica Parker wore a navy version 
of the dress in 2006

Tennis ace: Kate wore a cream knit Alexander McQueen dress for her appearance in the Royal box. It was a dress she has worn before - but this time the style was well-pitched for the sporting event

In the event, it was the perfect choice for a day at the tennis too.

Always
 impeccably turned out, Kate has an undeniable flair for fashion and 
frequently dresses as the occasion demands, whether it be top-to-toe red
 for Canada day, or a green coat for St Patrick's Day.

So it is no surprise that she seemed to have referenced 1920s tennis style with her outfit choice.

Arriving
 with William just in time to watch Roger Federer take Youzhny in 
straight sets on Centre Court, followed by Andy Murray's tense victory, 
looked as though she'd shopped from a Wimbledon kit list from the 
roaring Twenties.

After 
Federer dispatched with his Russian rival in straight sets, the royals 
were in for a far more stressful experience as British hope Andy Murray 
took on Spain's David Ferrer.

Inevitably
 the Scotsman lost the first set but turned it around to win the next 
three and march in to the semi-finals where he will face Jo-Wilfried 
Tsonga.

Murray mania: Kate looked worried today as Spain's David Ferrer held his serve to take the first game 40-0

Tense: The strain of the Murray match soon got too much for Kate, and she gasped as the two battled it out ont he court

Feeling the pressure: As Murray struggled to gain a lead on his opponent, Kate looked increasingly strained

Still grim-faced, she applauds as Murray, who lost five points in quick succession in the first set, takes a point back from his rival 

She accessorised the designer dress with a pair of £165 navy blue suede court shoes from LK Bennett.

It was a dress she has worn before - exactly a year ago today - when she made a trip to Prince Edward 
Island during her tour of Canada in 2011.

It is the first Wimbledon appearance 
of the year for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The royal pair's 
visit comes after Carole and Michael Middleton were guests in the Royal 
box yesterday, and Pippa and James Middleton sat alongside Felicity 
Kendal and her son Jake in the prestigious seats last Friday.

Good company: The duchess sat in the row in front of Anthony and Jane Henman, parents of former British tennis player Tim Henman

Game on: Just like the Middleton family, Kate and William are keen tennis fans and attended the tournament last year too - when Kate took part in a Mexican wave

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of 
Cornwall visited last week, meeting Andy Roddick and Tim Henman. It was 
Charles's first visit to the championship since 1970.

Today, the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge sat on the front row of the Royal Box - William next to Philip
 Brook, chairman of the All England Club, and Kate next to his wife, 
Gill.

They watched intently as Federer took
 on Youzhny, occasionally whispering to each other, and making 
conversation with Mr and Mrs Brook.

The match was delayed after just 24 minutes as drizzle hit SW19, and then again in the fourth set around 7pm with Andy Murray leading two sets to one.

Also on the front row of the Royal Box today were tennis couple Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf.

Other guests were television sports 
presenter Des Lynam with his partner, Rosemary Diamond, with veteran 
broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson and wife Mary.

Wool dressed: The knitted outfit was a wise choice given the chill in the air today

England manager Roy Hodgson, recently returned from the Euro 2012 tournament, and his wife Sheila were also in the box.

After his match, Federer revealed he had met William and Kate.

'I met Kate for the first time. William I've met before after Australia,' he said.

'They were very nice, very friendly. I was very happy to meet them.

'Royals coming out, I think it's 
inspiring. It's great for the event. It's great for Wimbledon. It's 
great for the club. It's great for the players.

'It's nice to see that the Royal Box 
is always full, as well. It's never empty for us. And if it is, you know
 they're going to come back shortly.

'They're not here just to drink champagne and tea in the back. They really do come for the tennis.

'We feel that on Centre Court, and I do feel that. That's probably one of the reasons why I play well on Centre Court.'

That's entertainment: The young looked to be enjoying the game between Roger Federer and Mikhail Youzhny today

Best seats in the house: The two sat in the same seats as Kate's mother Carole sat in yesterday, and Pippa and James last week

Thrilling: the Duchess chews her lip with nerves and a close call causes a sharp intake of breath

Close game: Kate reacts as she watches a particularly tense moment in the match and smiles broadly a little later

Enjoying the match: Federer commented after his game how much the presence of the Royals lifts the atmosphere on Centre Court

Good times: The royal two appeared to be having a great day in SW19

Greetings: William chats to Steffi Graf, just one among a number of former tennis pros in the Royal box today

The two greeted one another warmly before enjoying the match

Champs: Tennis sweethearts Andre Agassi and Steffi Graff enjoy the warm up

Memory lane: Sporty Agassi and his wife are used to being on the other side of the royal box

KATE'S STYLE INSPIRATION?

Snap! Twenties tennis players wore the same pleats as Kate's, and their jumpers tied at the neck reflect Kate's neck tie today

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge may have made the most high profile appearance of the day, but this was by far a day off for the rest of the senior Royals.

Lately it seems as though not a day goes by without an engagement for the Queen, who at 86 seems to be working harder than ever before.

The Queen and Prince Philip were in Scotland where they attended a Glasgow Cathedral service as part of the ongoing Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

The Queen was accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh in Glasgow this afternoon

The two enjoyed a performance from the Glasgow Youth Choir - including among their number former X Factor singer, Gamu.

As for Camilla and Charles, the two are currently enjoying a four day tour of Cornwall and the Scilly Isles to celebrate Charles' 60 years as Duke of Cornwall.

The two made an appearance in Newquay today where they paid a visit to the local Air Ambulance facilities.

The Cornish WI were on hand to provide refreshments - which Camilla enjoyed with great gusto.
