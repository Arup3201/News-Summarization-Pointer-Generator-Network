The family of a businessman who died - after suffering a single punch from a racist drunk who is still walking the streets - today called for the case against the attacker to be reopened.

Property manager Kamlesh Ruparelia, 55, originally from Uganda, was knocked down ‘like a skittle’ after being punched in the face by 38-year-old Kieran Beresford, who had drunk ten pints of cider.

Several witnesses told an inquest at Sheffield Coroner’s Court that the father of one did nothing to provoke his 6ft 4in attacker, who punched him after making racist remarks to two women in a pub.

The hearing came after prosecutors dropped a manslaughter charge against Beresford in February 2011 - who claimed self-defence - after deciding there was no realistic prospect of convicting him.

Mr Ruparelia, who fled Uganda in the 1970s aged 17 to become a successful businessman, running a takeaway and two supermarkets, died four days after the attack in hospital from a head injury.

Delivering his verdict, South Yorkshire Coroner Chris Dorries said the weight of evidence was that Mr Ruparelia was struck while involved in an argument, although he had not assaulted anyone.

He said he was in a ‘dilemma’ as law prevented him making findings in contradiction of the earlier proceedings - and he could not necessarily draw conclusions from the evidence ‘as I might like’.

But after the inquest, Mr Ruparelia’s family said in a statement: ‘The decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone over Kamlesh’s death and not to let a jury hear the evidence sends out the wrong message.

‘We are shocked by the mismanagement of the case and feel a double loss - the loss of Kamlesh and the loss of justice.

'The failure to prosecute this case to trial represents a serious failure by the CPS to demonstrate its commitment to protect the public.’

Mr Ruparelia was enjoying a game of pool with his cousin Jay Kotecha and the company of four women friends who were celebrating a birthday at the White Rose pub in Handsworth, Sheffield.

Mr Kotecha, 55, told the inquest Mr Beresford approached the women and said in a serious manner: ‘Why are you talking to these two P****?’

Mr Ruparelia, known as Kam, stood up to remonstrate and was floored by pub regular Beresford, known as Bez, with one punch.

One of the women, Shelley Brown, said of Beresford: ‘He didn’t seem as if he was on the same planet as me, he was swaying around.’

Another, Jennifer Steeples, said: ‘He 
hit Kam and he went down and his glasses went onto the pool table. I 
never saw Kam do anything. He just went down like a skittle and his head
hit the floor.’

Craig 
Coulson said the businessman told Beresford he had been rude to the 
women and was then punched by him. ‘He went down like a sack of spuds,’ 
he said. ‘He hit him with all his weight.’

Mr Ruparelia, from Dore, Sheffield, was attacked in October 2010.

Beresford,
an air conditioning fitter from Darnall, Sheffield was arrested and in 
two police interviews admitted he ‘snapped and lashed out’ at Mr 
Ruparelia.

He was charged with manslaughter but cleared in February, 2011 after the CPS were ‘unable to disprove the issue of self-defence’.

Beresford had only raised the issue of self-defence in his second police interview two days after Mr Ruparelia died.

Pathologist Dr Phillip Lumb said it was a ‘heavy punch’ which caused Mr Ruparelia to collapse and he was likely to have been rendered unconscious immediately.

Mr Beresford told the inquest Mr 
Ruparelia began shouting at him after he made a remark to the women and 
his cousin grabbed him by the neck.

In
his first police statement read at the inquest, Beresford said: ‘I just
lashed out at him. I connected really well. I just snapped.’

He
could not remember what started the incident but may have made a 
comment ‘in jest’ to the women. During his second interview he said he 
felt ‘extremely threatened’ and struck Ruparelia to get him away.

The coroner said in his findings: ‘It is clear that the initial row developed because of a racist remark by Mr Beresford.

‘It
is also apparent that words (but no blows) had been exchanged between 
Mr Ruparelia and Mr Beresford just prior to the punch being thrown.

‘Those who actually saw the punch were virtually unanimous in describing it as a very hard blow.’

His
narrative verdict read: ‘Kamlesh Ruparelia died at the Royal 
Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, of head injuries received in 
consequence of a single punch to the head delivered with great force 
during or immediately after an altercation (that was primarily between 
others over a racist remark) at the White Rose pub.’

Te
victim’s only son Nikhil, 25, and his sister Viduet Angeli, said they 
were devastated at the ‘absolute violation’ of Mr Ruparelia’s human 
rights.

‘We believe that a 
jury should have had the opportunity to consider and come to a 
conclusion on the evidence in this case and we do not understand why 
that was not permitted to happen,’ they said.

‘We have now heard the evidence given before the coroner and we understand that decision even less.’

Gerry Wareham, Deputy Chief Crown 
Prosecutor for South Yorkshire and Humberside, said: ‘We are aware of 
the comments of the Coroner Mr Dorries in relation to the CPS’s decision
not to prosecute Kieran Beresford for allegedly causing the death of Mr
Kamlesh Ruparelia in 2010.

'I just lashed out at him. I connected really well. I just snapped'

Kieran Beresford

‘The burden of proof required for a criminal court is greater than that of a coroner’s court. In a criminal court we must prove "beyond reasonable doubt" that the person committed all elements of the crime alleged.

‘The prosecution must also disprove any defence that the defendant was acting in self-defence. We worked closely with South Yorkshire Police and, based on the evidence available at the time, the CPS advised that Kieran Beresford should be charged with manslaughter for the killing of Mr Ruparelia.

‘Shortly before trial three new witness accounts were brought to the attention of CPS. Their evidence undermined the prosecution case as it supported the defence case that Kieran Beresford was acting in self-defence.

‘By law we must disclose to the defence any material in the case which could undermine the prosecution or assist the defence.  We cannot simply select the evidence which supports a prosecution.

‘We are also bound by the Code for Crown Prosecutors to consider at all stages of a case whether there remains a realistic prospect of a conviction and only proceed if this test is met.

‘After very careful consideration, taking into account this new evidence, we concluded that this was no longer the case and halted the prosecution.

‘At the earliest possible opportunity we informed Mr Ruparelia’s family and the court that the charge would be dropped. We also met Mr Ruparelia’s family to explain our decision. 

‘Mr Beresford was convicted of having an offensive weapon and received a conditional discharge and £775 costs. Our deepest sympathies are with Mr Ruparelia’s family.’
