This fully-functioning house is made entirely from recycled materials - including 20,000 toothbrushes which are used to fill cavities in the walls - instead of teeth.

The recycled home is cleverly constructed using compressed plastic bags, discarded carpet tiles, DVD cases, video tapes, old jeans and other waste offcuts by students from Brighton University.

They even sourced thousands of toothbrushes in just four days from a cleaning firm that empties airplanes after long-haul flights.Â 

The home, which is open to the public to view, even found a use for the dated video tape.

Architect Duncan Baker-Brown said: 'All the video rental shops seem to be closing down so we took all the DVD cases and VHS cassettes to use as insulation.'

And a company that imports jeans from China and slices of the legs to make shorts provided scrap denim to boost the building's insulation.

Waste paper was then compressed to make a material 'tougher than a paving stone' for flooring and carpet tiles which were blow torched and set.

It is one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the UK.

Three musketeers: David Pendegrass, Duncan Baker-Brown and Cat Fletcher from Brighton University who built the fully-functioning house from rubbish

Not so clean living: The University of Brighton's Waste House is made of recycled materials and rubbish and is one of the UK's most energy efficient homes

Innovative: Clever students from Brighton University found a new use for the virtually defunct video tape - by using them for insulation in the walls

Waste not want not: Ten tonnes of chalk waste were mixed with clay to create the walls, which are covered with tiles. The house is open for the public to view
