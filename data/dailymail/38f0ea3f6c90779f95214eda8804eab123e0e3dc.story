An elderly millionaire shot his sick wife dead then turned his shotgun on himself because he was worried about living alone, neighbours said yesterday.

Harold Ambrose, 82, rang police to say he had killed his wife Wendy, 77, and was going to take his own life.

Officers rushed to the couple’s £1.5million thatched cottage in the village of Boxted, near Colchester, Essex, and found his body in the garden.

Crime scene: Harold Ambrose, 82, rang police to say he had killed his wife Wendy, 77, and was going to take his own life at their cottage in Boxted, near Colchester, Essex

His wife, who had been diagnosed with cancer, had been shot in the head as she sat in a living room chair.

Essex Police were continuing investigations last night but said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.

A close friend and neighbour, who asked not to be named, said Mr Ambrose, a retired insurance underwriter who had early stage dementia, may have performed a ‘mercy killing’ on his wife and was not prepared to live without her.

‘Mr Ambrose was a classic country gentleman – very traditional and law-abiding,’ he said.

‘We know his wife had suffered from poor health for several years. Recently she had been in and out of hospital with respiratory problems.

'My understanding is that he wanted to end her pain and could not bear to live without her.’

Another neighbour said: ‘They were delightful. They were very dedicated [to each other] and had lived in the cottage all their married life as far as I knew.

‘I got the feeling that if one wasn’t there, the other would not feel complete.’

Shooting: Armed officers were sent to the thatched cottage at around 7am on Saturday where Mr Ambrose was found in the garden and his wife in the lounge chair

Forensic officers carried out investigations at the scene to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths

Anne Grant, who lives nearby, added: ‘They were pillars of the community.

'They
 were really smart and a couple who were very loving and close to one 
another. Wendy hadn’t been well and Harold was in the early stages of 
dementia.’

Police were contacted by Mr Ambrose early on Saturday morning and discovered the tragic scene shortly afterwards.

The road was closed over the weekend for forensic teams to search the area, but the cordon was lifted yesterday.

A
 post-mortem examination showed Mr Ambrose died from a single shotgun 
wound to the face. His wife, a retired secretary, had two head wounds.

The couple married in 1956 and had one daughter Clare, who is understood to be disabled and  living in a care home.

A bouquet of flowers from family members was leaning against the neat picket fence that surrounds the property yesterday, but relatives were too upset to comment.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Werrett said: ‘I do not believe anyone else was involved in their deaths. Our enquiries will continue and a report will be submitted to the coroner in due course.

‘The house will remain under police control while other searches are ongoing.’

A police spokesman confirmed the shotgun used in the shootings had been licensed to Mr Ambrose.
