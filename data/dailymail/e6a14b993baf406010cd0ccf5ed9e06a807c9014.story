Adam Lallana’s big-money move from Southampton to Liverpool has landed AFC Bournemouth a massive windfall of £5.75 million.

A deal was struck between Saints and the Championship side after Lallana was poached from the Cherries’ academy at the age of 12 back in 2000. It was agreed that Bournemouth would get 25 per cent of any fee Southampton received for the England midfielder.

Lallana completed his £23m move from Southampton to Liverpool on Tuesday and the clause in the contract came into play.

Put it in writing: The contract agreed when Bournemouth sold Lallana to Southampton in 2000

Young potential: Adam Lallana (circled) as part of the Junior Cherries under 10's in 1998

Loan star: Lallana moved from Bournemouth to Southampton in 2000 but returned on loan in 2007

As a youngster, Lallana was invited by Bournemouth youth coach Terry Wateridge to join the club's Centre of Excellence.

However,
 his potential was eventually spotted by a talent scout from 
Southampton, with Lallana snapped up by the Premier League club as a
 12-year-old in September 2000.

An
 independent tribunal ruled that Cherries should receive a level of 
compensation from Saints, with a nominal sum paid shortly after his 
departure.

The Saints paid £2,000 for a 12-year-old Lallana and a £1,000 finding fee.

A further £5,000 was paid when signed a scholarship with Southampton and then another £10,000 was paid when he signed his first professional contract in 2006.

In total Southampton paid £18,000 for the player over the years and with the 25 per cent sell-on clause also inserted, meaning Bournemouth will net a further £5.75m.

Moving on: Lallana first signed for Southampton aged 12, and made his debut for them in 2006

Lallana returned to play for the Cherries on loan back in 2007 under then boss Kevin Bond - but it is his move from St Mary's to Anfield that will have a far bigger impact on his childhood club. 

Having finished 10th last season following promotion from League One, the huge pay-out will help Eddie Howe establish the Cherries in their second season in the Championship.

And Howe is delighted Bournemouth are able to reap the dividends of Lallana’s move to Merseyside.

'I think from our perspective it shows the importance of youth development and bringing young players through,' he told Sky Sports News.

'This club has always done it. If you look at recent history there’s been Danny Ings and Sam Vokes.

'Of course Adam didn’t make his way through because he left but it just goes to show that bringing young players through is the lifeblood of this club.

'People have put a lot of work into Adam at a young age. When you invest in young talent - we get them in at six or seven like most clubs do nowadays - the work we do with them is key.

'From our perspective we didn’t plan for this so any potential money would be gratefully received but it will be up to the owner to decide what he does with it.'

Howe added: 'I think he is an exceptional player. I’ve worked with him and I know him as a guy and what a first-class individual he is.

Young star: Bournemouth academy scout Terry Wateridge says he could see Lallana's talent from an early age

'He’s done brilliantly for Southampton and I’m sure he’ll do really well for Liverpool.'

And the man who discovered Lallana, Wateridge who now works as a youth scout, admitted Lallana’s talent was evident at a young age.

'He just had such ability and we all loved him,' he said.

'He’s a natural and he had such unbelievably quick feet and incredible balance. Because he was never very big and had a low centre of gravity he drifted by players as if they didn’t exist much the same way he does now.

'Even now it’s quite strange to see him play and thinking all those years ago he was this little lad who turned up at training at Bournemouth Football Club.'
