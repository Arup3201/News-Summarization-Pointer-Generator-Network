A petrol-bomb attack on a policewoman was yesterday being treated as attempted murder.

A gang of around 15 men surrounded the unmarked car as the officer sat inside, smashed its windows and threw in the bomb.

Following the incident, the worst in more than a week of disorder in Belfast, the Northern Ireland Secretary attacked Loyalist mobs for ‘dishonouring and shaming’ the Union Flag.

MPs united to condemn the outbreak of
violence, which began after the number of days the British flag flies 
above Belfast City Hall was cut.

The woman officer was guarding the 
Belfast offices of Alliance Party MP Naomi Long, who had received a 
death threat after her cross-community party backed the controversial 
move to reduce the number of days on which the flag was flown.

The woman officer escaped unhurt but 
the attack, on Monday, was one of several incidents across the province 
which police said were being ‘stoked’ by social media.

Yesterday Theresa Villiers told MPs: 
‘There is nothing remotely British about what they are doing; they are 
dishonouring and shaming the flag of our country with their lawless and 
violent activities.'

Thirty-two police officers have been hurt and 38 people charged since the violence began.

Rioters gathered at Broadway Roundabout following a protest over the decision by Belfast City Council to stop flying the union flag every day

PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George
Hamilton said the officer was lucky to escape with his life outside the
MP's office on the Newtownards Road.

Officers were also attacked with petrol bombs in south Belfast close to the M1 motorway.

He
said: 'This was a planned attempt to kill a police officer which also 
put the lives of the public in danger and it is fortunate there were no 
injuries.'

Peter Robinson, 
the Northern Ireland First Minister and leader of the Democratic 
Unionist Party had talks in Belfast with Mike Nesbitt, leader of 
the Ulster Unionist Party to try to agree some sort of agreed political 
strategy in a bid to ease tensions and end the violence on the streets.

They
have been heavily criticised by nationalist representatives over their 
leadership since the trouble first flared a week ago.

The trouble followed a council decision to limit the flying of the Union flag to designated days only. Ms Long's Alliance Party has been blamed by the loyalists for supporting the nationalist SDLP and Sinn Fein in pushing through the vote to lower the flag.

There were also protests  in Limavady, Co Londonderry, Ballyclare, Co Antrim, Ballycastle, Co Antrim and Cookstown, Co Tyrone where the car of a DUP member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Ian McCrea, was surrounded by loyalist who were angry at his presence.

Several roads in Belfast were blocked and at one stage police were also attacked with petrol bombs and fireworks at Broadway, not far from the M1 motorway.

Last week Ms Long was told by police to stay away from her home and her office on the Newtownards Road because of fears for her safety.

Constituency offices used by the party were also attacked in Carrickfergus, Co Antrim and Bangor, Co Down.

Mr Robinson and Mr Nesbitt have already called for loyalist restraint, and according to a statement tonight they agreed to work on a 'joint basis with a view to urgently bringing forward political proposals to address widespread concerns across the community.'
