A nursery worker has been sentenced to 12 months in prison after using hidden cameras to spy on children at an after school club.

James Hoffman, 34, a self-confessed loner is suspected to have Aspergers syndrome.

He made the recordings over eight years, Croydon Crown Court heard.

Hoffman used used a camera concealed 'on his person' to film children between the ages of five and 11 at an after school club. 

Croydon Crown Court heard that nursery worker James Hoffman secretly filmed children between the ages of five and 11

He also used a second hidden camera to film adult colleagues using the toilet at the nursery where he worked.

Hoffman, of Purley, worked for the Jancett Nursery group across South London from the age of 18.

He was arrested after a hidden camera was found by adults in a cubicle of the staff room toilets of a nursery in Sutton, Surrey.

When Hoffman was asked by another member of staff why he had done it, he said it was because he was lonely and he had never had a girlfriend.

A subsequent raid of his home found recordings dating back over many years.

The films included at least 16 
secret recordings of people going to the toilet.

There was also 25 minutes of footage of half-naked children playing in a garden was found which had been filmed over a fence.

Ten indecent images of children were found on Hoffman’s laptop in the police raid. They included an image at level five, which are classified as the most extreme images of child pornography.

Hoffman pleaded guilty to eight charges of voyeurism, and four of possession of indecent images of a child, on August 22.

Sentencing, Hoffman to 12 months in prison, Judge Daniel Flahive said: 'This is a very serious offence as you were in a trusted position. You are anxious in the company of adults and unable to interact socially. I have read the psychiatric reports and it appears very likely you suffer from Aspergers, which goes some way to explain your behaviour. However, an immediate custodial sentence is necessary due to the invasion of privacy and your abuse of trust.'

Hoffman will also be put on the sex offenders register for 10 years. He could be out of prison in six weeks because of time served on remand.
