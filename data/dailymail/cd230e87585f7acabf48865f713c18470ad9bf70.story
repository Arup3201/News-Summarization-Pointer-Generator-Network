It's well-known that elephants are intelligent and graceful creatures - but these animals have taken that reputation a step further by becoming professional painters.

The group of seven Asian elephants  hold specially-designed brushed in their trunks, which they use to create beautiful floral scenes.

And the clever mammals, who live in Thailand have even developed a skill that humans can't match - the ability to suck up paint in their trunks to spray it over a canvas like an aerosol can.

Careful and not so careful: Sometimes the elephants wield specially-designed brushed with their trunks (left) - while other times they take the less subtle approach of painting with their feet

For slightly less precise images, the elephants can also use their huge feet - which they dip in paint then use to daub large canvasses on the floor.

The amazing fruits of their labour are then sold on by the sanctuary - for as much as £1,300 each - and the money used to support the Maesa Elephant Camp, where the seven live.

Teaching elephants to paint was a technique pioneer at Maesa, and is now used in several other sanctuaries to help raise money for the animals.

Earning their keep: The sanctuary sells the paintings, which gives them extra revenue to care for the elephants

The most sophisticated elephant artists - who were trained by a Chinese painter nine years ago - are now skilled enough to paint realistic-looking bunches of flowers, rather than the more impressionistic work favour by the others.

When creating the works, the elephants are guided by a trainer, who gives them instructions by rubbing their ears in a particular way.

The 
elephants use a special non-toxic paint, and adapted paint brushes that 
make it comfortable for them to hold with their trunks.

The
paintings mostly feature primary colours, as elephants' ability to distinguish between different shades is limited.

Buyers: The elephant paintings, some of which are shown on the wall here, can fetch as much as £1,300 at auction

'Perfect tool': Elephants' trunks have been described as an ideal implement for painting

The elephants at work were captured French photographer Olivier Blaise.

Mr Blaise, 48, said: 'The agility and sensitivity of an elephant's trunk means that it's a perfect tool for painting. The gesture is both sweeping and very precise!'

'The trunk is also used like an aerosol spray, as the paint is diluted with water it is a fun and natural way for the elephants to paint.'

The paintings, which are around 120cm in width, and vary in length, are sold on site at Maesa and also in auctions, with typical prices ranges from £205 to £1,300.
