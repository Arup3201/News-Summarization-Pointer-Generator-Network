A British Greenpeace activist being held in Russia on hooliganism charges has spoken of her relief after being released on bail.

Alex Harris was arrested at sea two months ago when protesters tried to scale a Russian oil rig in the Arctic.

Miss Harris, 27, skipped for joy as a judge in St Petersburg ruled she will be granted bail from a grim detention centre while she awaits trial.

months in a Russian prison after being arrested for attempting to occupy
an Arctic oil platform

‘This has been the hardest experience 
of my life,’ she said afterwards, adding: ‘I will not dishonour 
Greenpeace or my country by trying to flee Russia or the investigation.’

Activist Anthony Perrett and 
journalist Kieron Bryan have also been bailed. They were among six 
British nationals in the ‘Arctic 30’ who were imprisoned following the 
protest against drilling in the Arctic.

They were originally charged with 
piracy, but the Russians changed this to hooliganism, which could see 
them sent to jail for up to seven years, rather than 15.

Miss Harris, 27, who acted as 
communications officer on Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise vessel, said: ‘I’m
really happy. It’s not over yet but there’s light at the end of the 
tunnel.’ In a recent letter to her parents, the activist had said she 
was ‘trying very, very hard not to lose hope’. ‘Surely my future isn’t 
rotting in a prison in Murmansk?!’ she wrote.

Speaking at the family home in Dolton,
north Devon, her father Cliff said: ‘This is fantastic news for us. It 
was nice to see her come into the courtroom with a smile on her face and
holding her head high. These must have been two incredibly hard months 
for her, and we’re incredibly proud of how she has conducted herself 
throughout this ordeal.’

Mr Harris, 63, told how as a child, his daughter idolised David Attenborough and was fascinated by news about the environment.

He said: ‘Anything that was detrimental to wildlife she would sit up and take notice.

‘I can remember when she was young she
had a poster up of David Beckham. All of a sudden Beckham was out of 
favour and David Attenborough was her new hero. She didn’t actually have
any posters, but she really idolised him.’

Miss Harris joined Greenpeace two 
years ago in an office-based role and was on her first field trip when 
arrested by the Russians. Her father continued: ‘We didn’t envisage that
this whole situation was going to erupt like it did. We’ve found it 
very frightening. These are just ordinary people who care about the 
environment. The charges are ridiculous – what happened wasn’t piracy or
hooliganism.’

Ms Harris said the past two months in prison had been difficult, describing the conditions as 'awful' and the food as 'disgusting'

The family of London-based Mr Bryan, 
29, said in a statement: ‘It’s amazing news to know that Kieron will be 
released from prison soon.

‘Our relief is obviously tempered by 
the fact that he is still facing absurd charges, despite the fact that 
he was just doing his job.’ The American captain Peter Willcox was also 
bailed but the ship’s Australian radio operator Colin Russell was 
refused bail and ordered to remain in jail until February 24.

The Russians alleged drug use on the vessel and have even hinted at espionage, without producing  any evidence.

Even if they are released the 
activists will not be able to leave Russia as their passports were 
confiscated by the security service.

 John Sauven, executive director of 
Greenpeace in the UK, said yesterday: ‘Today’s decision by the court 
will come as a huge relief to family and friends.’ The ‘Arctic 30’ and 
their boat were taken from waters near the port of Murmansk on September
19 after two of them tried to board the Russian rig.

Greenpeace has warned a spill in 
Arctic waters would be highly damaging to the environment and the 
extraction of more fossil fuels would add to climate change impacts. 
Eleven Nobel Peace Prize laureates wrote to Russian president Vladimir 
Putin calling for the original piracy charges to be dropped.
