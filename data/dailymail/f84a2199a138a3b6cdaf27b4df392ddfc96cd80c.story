The devastated mom of an Oklahoma Army lieutenant charged with murder after ordering troops to shoot two lookouts in Afghanistan has made an emotional plea that her son is innocent.

Anna Lorance claims her son, First Lieutenant Clint Lorance, is being unfairly victimized by the military for allegedly ordering troops under his command to illegally shoot two Afghan villagers in 2012.

He has since been removed from his position and sits at Fort Bragg, N.C. awaiting a court martial set for July 30. He faces two counts of second-degree murder.

‘My son does not deserve this,’ her mom told ABC11. ‘He did the only thing he felt he could do, thinking of his troops and himself, to bring them back home alive.’

The incident happened last July when Lorance, a platoon leader, gave the order for his soldiers to shoot the men as they approached a checkpoint on motorcycles in a remote sector of Kandahar Province. 

Even though the platoon was in a combat zone, military prosecutors say the men showed, ‘no indication of a hostile act, or hostile intent.’

Lorance claims he was only trying to protect his platoon.

He told his mother he was on high alert, heading into enemy territory, and was getting radio warning from Army pilots patrolling the skies when it happened.

His family believe he is being unfairly treated and have launched a website to highlight his case. 

More than 3,000 people from around the world have signed a petition to drop the charges.

'There's no way my son could do anything besides give 100 percent of himself to be an officer,' said Anna Lorance.

Lorance is also charged with attempted murder for ordering his men to unsuccessfully shoot at a third man. He's also accused of making false official statements, ordering illegal harassing fire into a village, obstructing justice and making threats against villagers.

The two soldiers who fired the shots have been reprimanded but won't have to go through a full court martial.
