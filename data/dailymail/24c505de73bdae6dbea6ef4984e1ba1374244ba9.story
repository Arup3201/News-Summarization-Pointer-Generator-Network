A Yemeni faction of al-Qaeda may be planning on attacking western targets, including the United States, a recent video indicates.

The video allegedly shows a gathering of hundreds of al-Qaeda members, filmed during a celebration of a mass jailbreak of fighters in Sana'a, Yemen.

During the 15-minute clip, which was reportedly shot last month and just emerged, the leader of  Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) speaks of 'removing America'.

Threat: The 15 minute video was filmed as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula celebrated a mass breakout from a prison in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, and surfaced on several YouTube channels

The video was posted on several YouTube channels, including terrorism and political violence watchdog TRAC - Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium - and is dated March 2014.

It shows masked men waving al Qaeda's black flag and celebrating the arrival of members who were freed from the main prison in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen.

The jailbreak in February saw attackers mount a bomb, grenade and gun assault on the
 prison, freeing 29 inmates, including 19 jailed for 
terrorism-related crimes.

At the centre of the film is Nasser al-Wuhaishi, a man who has been named the 'crown prince' of AQAP.

'We have to remember that we are always fighting the biggest enemy,’ says al-Wuhaishi. ‘We have to remove the cross, (and) the bearer of the cross, America.'

Although the authenticity of the video has not yet been independently verified, U.S. officials told CNN they believe it to be real.

Security experts have criticized American intelligence for allowing such a meeting to take place without their knowledge.

'The U.S. intelligence community should be surprised that such a large group of al-Qaeda assembled together, including the leadership, and somehow they didn't notice,' Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst said.

Abdulrazzaq al-Jamal, a journalist who has interviewed members of AQAP, said it was the largest known gathering of al Qaeda in Yemen.

‘It included about 400 people, and these are not all the members of the group. This gathering is a confirmation that al Qaeda is gaining strength and influence,’ he said.

Formed in 2009, AQAP has attacked military targets, tourists and diplomats in Yemen and taken over territory for long periods.

U.S. drone attacks have killed several suspected AQAP figures, including Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born Islamist cleric accused of links to a plot to bomb a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 and U.S. cargo planes in 2010.

‘Al Qaeda will gain strength as there continues to be division and weakness in security performance,’ said Ali al-Sarari, political adviser to Prime Minister Mohammed Salem Basindwa.

‘The last appearance (the video) shows that Yemen is confronting a dangerous challenge. And if the security performance continues in this manner, then Yemen will face an even bigger failure than what it has faced in the past.’
