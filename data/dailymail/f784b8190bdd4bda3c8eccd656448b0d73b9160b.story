Jose Mourinho claimed on Friday that Manchester United are ready to sell Wayne Rooney in the summer.

The Chelsea manager cranked up the heat ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash against United by suggesting Old Trafford chiefs will look to offload Rooney to an overseas club at the end of the season.

Rooney is expected to miss Sunday's game with a groin injury but United are considering risking him and he could travel with the team.

Mourinho remains interested in the England striker, having failed in a bid to land him last summer, but he said: ‘United were clear in the way they approached the Rooney situation.

‘They don’t swap. They don’t sell. I don’t see that changing, they were very clear about that.

‘Will it be the same this summer? I think maybe this summer they will try to sell to a non-direct rival. But they were very clear, not to a domestic direct rival.’

Mourinho will return for Rooney at the end of the season but his barbs at United are not likely to help his attempts to land the forward.

The Chelsea boss said earlier this week he had inside information about the mood at Old Trafford.

Not happy: Mourinho says his opinion of United is based on his words with Sir Alex Ferguson over the years

The Portuguese told London’s Evening Standard newspaper: ‘My feeling, which is based on years of communicating with Sir Alex and some inside information, is Man United are not happy, but they are calm.’

David Moyes, whose side trail third-placed Chelsea by nine points, yesterday said Mourinho had apologised to him for those comments.

‘I have seen it and I have had an apology from the Chelsea media department and from Jose.’

Moyes refused to be drawn about the possible departure of Rooney but said he would not talk about players at rival clubs.

‘I wouldn’t do it but everybody has their own style,’ said Moyes. ‘I can’t tell you what Jose’s motivation is but only time will give you the answer about Wayne.’

Rocky: Rooney's relationship with Ferguson was tentative in the final years of the Scot's tenure at United

Rooney has 18 months left on his contract, meaning United may be forced to sell him this summer to ensure they do not lose him for nothing at the end of next season.

But Moyes, who revealed Rooney has returned to light training at the club’s Carrington HQ following a warm-weather break in Egypt,  re-iterated the club will try to extend the striker’s deal.

He said: ‘The club will deal with that. They will do all the things they need to do, no question.’

Mourinho yesterday revealed Sir Alex Ferguson told him he was retiring two weeks before making the decision public.

The pair have a close relationship off the pitch and Mourinho admitted he was nervous when Ferguson trusted him with his secret.

‘I knew a couple of weeks before the announcement because my friend (Ferguson) was nice to me and trusted me completely,’ said the Chelsea boss.

‘He told me something really important before the press. He said I was one of his best friends in football so he wanted me to know before I read about it. 

‘I was afraid because I was sure someone might leak and the boss might think it had come from me. But it would never have.

‘It was the same way he knew from me I was coming back to Chelsea.’
