It's a problem we all face each week, getting to laundry day only to find you don't have enough quarters for the machine.

But now a company is offering to solve the problem, by mailing you $20 worth of quarters each month for the bargain price of $26.99.

Or, if you don't think you'll get through that many washes, then there's the budget option of $10 worth of quarters for only $15 per month.

Washboard offers to make laundry day easier for customers by offering to deliver $20 worth of quarters per month at a cost of $26.99 or $10 worth for $14.99

Washboard was co-founded by Caleb Brown, 27, a Pittsburgh-based software developer, and Shaun Chapman, a designer based in Mountain View.

Speaking to Valleywag, Brown said: 'It is a legit business. We do have customers. A few. Very few. Less than ten.

'I'll admit, it's a little bit of a negative critique, which is good. I think it's good. I think it's a polarizing thing.

'Laundry pickup services are expensive and often have long turnaround times. For many folks, the biggest pain point is simply finding enough quarters.

'Banks have long lines and close early. We put getting quarters on autopilot so you never have to worry about it again.'

The website includes a calculator to help users work out how many quarters they'll need. The site's creators insist it 'is a legit business' despite having less than ten customers

On Twitter, user Matthew Bailey said: 'Washboard. When you're too rich to care about the value of a quarter yet still have to do your own laundry.'

While Seth Rubenstien added: '$14.99 a month for... $10 in quarter for the laundromat. Sometimes the internet makes me sad.'

Meanwhile, Cale Mooth said: Is this real? Quarter delivery service? Washboard isn't for laundering clothes, it's for laundering money.'

Co-founder Brown and Chapman came up with the idea after both writing down 'quarter delivery' when coming up with ideas for new businesses
