West Ham are hoping to hold talks over a new contract for defender Winston Reid next week.

The New Zealand international captain has been one of the club’s most consistent performers and has drawn attention from Premier League rivals such as Tottenham, QPR, Everton and Liverpool.

The added attraction is that the 26-year-old, West Ham’s player of the year in 2013, is in the final year of his deal and can walk away next summer for free and talk to foreign clubs from January.

It is understood his advisers are waiting to see what other offers come forward although West Ham are prepared to give him a contract that will push him towards their top earners.

Reid has played 100 times in the Premier League for West Ham since joining from Danish side Midtjylland in 2010.

He has played 18 times for New Zealand, scoring once in the 2010 World Cup finals.

The 26-year-old defender is one of West Ham's top performers, and Sam Allardyce is keen to tie him down
