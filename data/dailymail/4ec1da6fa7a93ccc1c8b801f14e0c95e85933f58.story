This is the heartbreaking moment new parents John and Tracey Gamble cradle their dying son, just minutes after medics caused a bleed on his brain during a traumatic and bungled delivery.

Frank Gamble's tiny skull was fractured by 'poor technique or excessive force' during the ill-fated forceps birth after his head was found to be in the wrong position for the labour, an inquest heard.

He died just hours later. 

Medics had attempted to deliver him with the tool on three separate occasions but were forced to move to an emergency C-section when the infant’s heart stopped beating.

Chelmsford Coroners' Court into the tragic baby’s death heard lead doctor Consultant Prof Mohammed Khaled, who was holding the forceps, should have overseen a safe birth.

But instead he was used 'poor technique or excessive force' which he should have ensured did not happen, independent experts told the hearing.

The senior medic, who has been on restricted duties following the death, told the inquest Frank’s head was in a rotated position causing the forceps to unlock.

Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner for Essex Caroline Beasley-Murray said Frank could have been saved if 'appropriate' action had been taken earlier in the labour.

Mrs Beasley-Murray said: 'There were very serious failings in the care of Tracey Gamble and baby Frank received at Colchester hospital.

'If appropriate care had been provided baby Frank might have survived.

'It is encouraging to read from the trust’s own investigation report how seriously it has taken these events.

'It is to be hoped that there has been learning from this experience.

'No one else should be allowed to endure the anguish that the Gamble family endured in April last year.'

The coroner said to tearful Mrs Gamble: 'At the end of the day of evidence I said it had been a real ordeal for you, but you had all showed such dignity and you are continuing to show that.

'Frankie would have been a much loved little boy and I would like to express my condolences to you.'

Frank was confirmed dead shortly after he was delivered by C-section at 10.54pm, on April 18, 2012, at Colchester General Hospital, Essex.

At the inquest opening on June 27 the coroner was told Prof Khaled should have known how to carry out a safe delivery with forceps.

But independent expert Dr Jeremy Brockelsby told the coroner either a poor technique or excessive force was used.

Dr Jeremy Brockelsby said skull fractures were rare and Frank’s parents did not receive the standard of care they were entitled to.

Midwife Tamera Aberthart-Briggs told the inquest said was worried for the mother during the delivery and the baby’s heartbeat was lost after the third failed attempt to use forceps.

She told the inquest that evening would stay with her 'forever'.

Devastated parents Tracey and John Gamble, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, are now considering taking legal action against Colchester Hospital.

The family’s solicitor revealed the couple had hoped for a verdict of 'neglect'.

In a statement on behalf of the family Fran Pollard, from Gadsby Wicks Solicitors, said: 'The family wish to convey that the night of April 18 last year will haunt Tracey and John and the extended family for the rest of their days.

'They are disappointed with the coroner’s verdict, but hope lessons will be learned from this tragedy so that no other family has to experience the devastated that they have endured.'

Following the inquest a spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to Mr and Mrs Gamble for the sad death of their son, Frank.

'The 15 months since Frank’s death will clearly have been an unbearable time for the whole family and we appreciate that the inquest will also have brought back very difficult and distressing memories.

'Whilst nothing can now change the sad events of 18 April 2012, it is our hope that the action we have taken to understand why this happened and the steps we have taken to achieve as much learning as possible from this tragic event indicate how seriously we have taken Frank’s death.

'We continue to work with staff to ensure they always aim for safe, high quality care, and always learn where improvements are needed.'

Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust - which runs the hospital - was one of 14 Trusts under review due to higher than average death rates.

A report released this week did not recommend it to be placed in special measures.
