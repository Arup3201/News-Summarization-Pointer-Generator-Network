Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony is facing an FA investigation over his incredible Twitter rant at the club’s players, fans and referee Jeremy Simpson.

The millionaire owner of the League One club lost his temper after Posh’s fourth defeat in five League games at home, this time 2-0 by struggling Colchester.

MacAnthony took to social media with a 14-point blast at the team, stay-away supporters and the official, who booked eight and dismissed manager Darren Ferguson. Simpson and Peterborough have history — two players were sent off this season against Crewe.

Having accused the players of ‘folding like a stack of cards’ he then laid into the referee, saying: ‘P..d off we had a ref who cost us Crewe game cause of incorrect decision was given us again, then sent manager off & many yellows today!’

Those comments will not go down well at the FA, who monitor Twitter. Likewise, the PFA could lodge a complaint with the club for the way MacAnthony chose to pinpoint players. The only person to escape criticism was boss Ferguson, who was sent to the stand for querying decisions.

MacAnthony, who started every tweet with ‘p***** off’, singled out midfielder Joe Newell for missing a sitter and had a pop at fans who have deserted the club. He then pledged to carry on paying the bills at London Road and finished: ‘Oh & finally; if any of my plyrs are bit too sensitive to whats been said,feel free to let me know anytime.Or Alternatively just do your job!’ 

Here is the list of the 14 tweets from disgruntled Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony on Saturday

Some fans supported his comments while others complained he had overstepped the mark but MacAnthony was unrepentant. He posted: ‘As for people saying you shouldn’t tweet etc as its not becoming of a chairman; I live in the 21st Century, maybe others should do the same!’

MacAnthony boarded a jet back to his home in the United States on Sunday night, declining to say any more.

Dublin-born MacAnthony, a millionaire property entrepeneur, took over as Peterborough chairman in September 2006 following the departure of Barry Fry and became club's owner the following summer.

Peterborough won promotion from League Two to the Championship in successive seasons in 2009 and won promotion back to the second tier after relegation in 2010, only to drop back down to League One again in 2013.
