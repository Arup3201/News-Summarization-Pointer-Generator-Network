Harlequins stay top of Pool 2 despite this narrow defeat but have Leinster for company now after this thrilling battle in a freezing Dublin.

Mike Brown and Danny Care inspired a stirring second-half fightback from Quins, who came from 11-3 down to lead 13-11 with little over 10 minutes to play.

An Ian Madigan penalty proved decisive in the end, with the match marred by a late punch-up and a somewhat strange yellow card for Charlie Matthews, for bringing his hand close to the eyes of Dominic Ryan during the scuffle, despite officials saying they were not sure he was eye-gouging.

Quins host Wasps in round five in January and a win there will take them close to the knockout stages, since their final pool match is against hapless Castres.

They will rue a disallowed try and six points spurned by rookie kicker Tim Swiel. Making only his fifth senior appearance for Harlequins, Swiel badly mishit a second-minute penalty.

That brought the first roars from Leinster supporters but the visitors steamed into the contest. Quins took two quick lineouts inside the first five minutes, determined to keep the ball in play and run the legs off the three-time champions on their home pitch.

Madigan eventually kicked Leinster in front after 25 minutes but they kept applying pressure like a tourniquet and were rewarded with a try — only their fourth in Europe this season – when Isaac Boss slid over in the 32nd minute. A quick pick-up from Jamie Heaslip off an attacking scrum close to the Quins line allowed him to pop a pass to Boss, who had an unimpeded dart to the line.

Madigan missed the conversion but, within two minutes, Swiel spurned another easy chance to open the Harlequins account.

Having to start without former All Black Nick Evans in the No 10 shirt looked as damaging as losing Chris Robshaw given their team-mates’ failure to string together coherent attacks in the first half.

In Care and Brown, though, Conor O’Shea had two proven Test-quality backs in his arsenal and they combined for a marvellous try two minutes after the restart, Care’s delicate chip behind the Leinster defence caught by the on-rushing Brown.

But incredibly, referee Romain Poite judged that Harlequins had knocked on earlier in the move, despite video evidence suggesting the ball had been touched by a Leinster hand.

Harlequins refused to feel downhearted and won a thumping scrum penalty in the 46th minute, with Swiel finally landing a kick at goal.

Quins minced their opponents with two huge scrums and from the second they won a penalty to set in train the move that ended with a legitimate Brown try, with Swiel converting.

The Leinster cause was further weakened by a silly penalty given away by Leinster lock Devin Toner for tackling Clifford without the ball. Swiel swept over the line to score and put his team ahead with 15 minutes remaining.

Leinster survived a 25-metre scrum in the 70th minute and broke quickly forward, the attack ending with Harlequins going offside and a penalty scored by Madigan to nose Leinster back ahead. Then came the scuffle but, more importantly, Leinster won the penalty and somehow held on.
