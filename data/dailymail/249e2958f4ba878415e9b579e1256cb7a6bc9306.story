Amazon is to allow customers to bid on items for the first time in a move designed to take on eBay. 

The new feature represents a renewed attempt by Amazon to move beyond the fixed-price model on its site.

Sellers who are open to bargaining can enable the 'make an offer' button. 

Once a price is agreed on, the item is placed in the customer's cart and they're free to complete the transaction before their new deal is shipped to their doorstep.

When a customer proposes a lower price, the seller will be notified and will have the option of accepting, rejecting or countering the offer.

Peter Faricy, vice president of Amazon Marketplace, said the company heard feedback from sellers who said they believed 1:1 negotiations would help drive more sales and loyal customers.

'The new 'Make an Offer' experience is a game-changer for Amazon customers looking for great prices on one-of-a-kind items, and for sellers looking to communicate and negotiate directly with customers in an online marketplace environment just like they do normally in their own physical store or gallery,' he said. 

In 1999, Amazon launched an online auction site, but the effort failed to compete with eBay Inc.

Amazon went on to create a lucrative marketplace for third-party sellers which now accounts for about 40 percent of its quarterly unit sales.

In a recent survey of sellers conducted by Amazon, nearly half of the respondents said the ability to negotiate prices 'would be important to drive more sales on Amazon', said Peter Faricy, who runs Amazon Marketplace.

The move is the latest in a huge number of launches from Amazon, which include smart speakers and courier delivery in New York. Here, Jess Bezos shows off the firm's Kindle tablets.

The largest U.S. online retailer said the new 'make-an-offer' was distinct from an auction because price negotiations are private and a customer will never pay more than the listed price. 

Sellers have 72 hours to reject, accept or counter an offer from a customer. 

If the seller counters, the customer has another 72 hours to respond.

Amazon plans to expand the 'make-an-offer' option to 'hundreds of thousands' of items in 2015.

Items that can be negotiated now include an 1863 document signed by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln sold for $150,000 and a mint-condition baseball signed by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig with a nearly $10,000 price tag.
