A man fitting the description of the suspected murderer of 17-year-old student Masa Vukotic has been arrested by police near the scene of the crime.

In dramatic scenes, a man was surrounded by police just metres away from where schoolgirl Masa Vukotic was found with multiple fatal stab wounds on Tuesday night.

He has been arrested and is currently being questioned by police. He has not yet been charged. 

The man who was detained was dressed in all black, reminiscent of the suspect seen in CCTV footage running from the scene with a plastic bag believed to contain the murder weapon.

Victoria Police say they’ve taken him in for questioning but ‘at this stage there’s nothing to connect him to the crime’.

Although the person taken in for questioning matches the description of the suspect, the Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia ‘there are plenty of people who wear black jumpers so it doesn’t necessarily mean anything’.

Victoria Police could not confirm that he was remanded near the scene of the crime.  

The teenager was a Canterbury Girls Secondary College VCE student who was known by friends as Marsi. 

The teen's family was originally from Montenegro and of Serbian background. She had a love of Cosplay and was honoured by friends with a vigil at the scene of the crime.

A group of young people gathered at nightfall, 24 hours after her brutal murder. 

They wore pink and left a beautiful tribute of flowers and candles. 

They have paid tribute to their beloved friend on Facebook. 

'Marci Vukotic was a beautiful, loving, sweet, smart, charismatic and hilarious young woman with a bright future ahead of her,' they wrote.

'May she continue to do great things and watch over her loved ones. See you soon, princess Marci.'

Police believe it was a 'random attack' and are looking for a man aged in his twenties who was spotted by several witnesses and in CCTV footage fleeing the scene. 

Homicide Detective Inspector Michael Hughes said even though the CCTV images were side-on, police were able to get a good gauge on his build.

'If anyone knows him, they'll know him from the footage,' he told Nine News.

'Several people have spoken to us and we've certainly been able to put together the track (he took).'

Masa's distressed relatives were pictured arriving at the park last night following news of her death.
