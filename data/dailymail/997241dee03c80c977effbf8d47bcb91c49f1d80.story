Global aid agencies paid thousands of pounds in 'tax' to Islamic militant group al-Shabab during the 2011 famine in Somalia, a report has claimed.

In many cases, al-Shabab militants promised they would pass on aid money to those most in need but ended up keeping it for themselves.

The devastating famine, brought on by drought, killed more than 250,000 people across the horn of Africa, sparking a major refugee crisis as crops withered and water dried up.

Greed: Astonishingly, al-Shabab, which has links to al Qaeda, even demanded 'registration fees' of up to $10,000 per agency just to dole out much-needed supplies (pictured: al Shabab fighters train near Mogadishu)

Astonishingly, al-Shabab, which has links to al Qaeda, even demanded 'registration fees' of up to $10,000 per agency just to dole out much-needed supplies.

The terror group's strategy of controlling and coercing humanitarian effort was so sophisticated that it even set up a command centre called the 'Humanitarian Co-ordination Office'.

This raised further security concerns for agencies because it is forbidden under international law to engage with any terrorist group when providing aid to a country in need.

Survivors: Exhausted, rail-thin women were stumbling into refugee camps on a daily basis, many with dead babies and bleeding feet. More people died because some agencies were banned outright by al-Shabab, including most UN agencies and the Red Cross, while others withdrew because of the demands

The report, by the Overseas Development Institute and the Mogadishu-based Heritage Institute for Policy Studies, also describes how al-Shabab gave people extra food if they spied on the aid groups.

Some agencies were banned outright by al-Shabab, including most UN agencies and the Red Cross, while others withdrew because of the demands.

Although the report did not say which agencies paid the 'tax' and which did not.

The United nations declared famine
in Somalia in july 2011 after successive failed rains. Hundreds of 
thousands of Somalis fled to refugee camps in Kenya, Ethiopia and the 
Somali capital Mogadishu in search of food.

Fighter: Government forces, with the help of 18,000 UN-mandated African Union soldiers, have driven al-Shabab fighters out of most of the country's major towns and cities, but they still control swathes of rural Somalia

The journeys sometimes took weeks, and 
weaker family members - children and the elderly - were left behind on 
the way to die alone.
