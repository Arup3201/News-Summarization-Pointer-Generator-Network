Web retailers are turning up the hype around internet Christmas shopping with claims Black Friday will simply be the first of three record-breaking days.

Industry leaders suggest internet spending on Friday will hit an all-time high for a single day of £555.5million – over £385,000 a minute.

But they predict the figure will be higher still three days later on Cyber Monday, once people have browsed the web for bargains over the weekend, with spending predicted to reach £649.6million.

And they expect even these colossal figures will be outdone on the following Monday – so-called Manic Monday – with the total estimated at £676.5million.

The figures are based on shopping habits in previous years and come from the IMRG, which is the trade body for web retailers, and the spending and credit experts Experian.

The frenzy around Black Friday is testament to the fact Britain has become a global hot house for internet shopping – leading the way for the rest of the world.

Families in this country spend more online per head of population than any other nation in the world, including the US.

However, this shift has had many negative consequences for traditional bricks and mortar stores, which have put up the shutters, and town centres.

Traditional retailers are trying to combat this by turning Black Friday - so named as it is when shops usuallty start making a profit, or go ‘into the black’- into an event for the high street to mirror the pattern in the US, where it is seen as the start of the Christmas shopping season.

Asda, which is owned by American giant Wal-Mart, has been in the vanguard of efforts to push Black Friday into stores here. Last year, this led to a number of rowdy confrontations as people battled over cut-price TVs.

Many other retailers, such as Boots and House of Fraser, are now joining the Black Friday push with promises to slash prices by as much as 70 per cent.

Research by the IMRG and Experian suggests there will be spending of £555.5million and 124million visits to web stores on Friday, which would be up 17 per cent on last year.

It puts spending on Cyber Monday at £649.6m - £451,000 a minute – with visits to web stores at 145m, which would be up 26 per cent on 2013. The prediction for Manic Monday is £676.5m - £470,000 a minute – and 151m visits, which would also be 26 per cent higher than last year.

Internet stores say people are pushing their web shopping closer to Christmas because they are more confident that they will get their items, either delivered to their home or through click and collect.

IMRG’s chief information officer, Tina Spooner, said: ‘The US phenomenon of Black Friday is now firmly embedded in the UK e-retail calendar and, while the first two weeks of December are traditionally the peak festive trading weeks for the online retail industry, Black Friday now marks the start of the online shopping season.

‘Smartphones and tablets are set to account for over half of all traffic to retail websites during the festive season and on Black Friday alone, online spend via mobile devices is set to reach over £196m.

‘E-retail sales have grown 17 per cent year-to-date in 2014 and retailers are increasingly confident in their online performance during the fourth quarter, which indicates the industry is gearing up for another record-breaking Christmas.’

Experian’s James Miller said the switch to online Christmas shopping is being driven by the fact it is now viewed as an important leisure activity for a wide variety of people, from active middle-income families with teenage children to young singles.

‘These tech-savvy groups are typically early adopters of new technology trends, prolific online shoppers, and active users of mobile and tablet devices,’ he said.

A survey by the vouchercloud website found almost two in three – 62 per cent – would be browsing for bargains on Friday. Top of the shopping lists are televisions, tablet computers, clothing, toys and games consoles.

Matthew Wood, of vouchercloud.com , said: ‘Our friends from across the pond have certainly helped to create even more of a retail frenzy in the run up to Christmas than already existed. All of the UK’s largest brands now participate in the special festive event and it is certainly seen as the catalyst to spark the Christmas shopping season.’

House of Fraser is promising price cuts on selected items on Friday through to Monday. There are a number of deals that will only be available on Friday, including £120 off a Dyson handheld vacuum, bringing it down to £99; £60 off Jamie Oliver pan sets and 70per cent off some Samsonite suitcases.

Deals at Boots through the weekend include a Toni & Guy Style Session Straightener, which is 46 per cent off at £26.99, and a Philips Sonicare

Diamond Clean Pink Rechargeable Toothbrush, which is down by £150 to £99.99.

Amazon has been running a series of ‘Black Friday’ deals all this week. The latest include the Trust Jukebar Wireless Speaker which is 45 per cent off at £22.99 and its Kindle Fire HD tablet, which is down from £199 to £99.
