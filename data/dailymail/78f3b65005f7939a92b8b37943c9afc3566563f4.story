An abandoned springer spaniel had to be put down after he was neglected so badly the fur on his ears hardened until they were as hard as horns.

The ears of the unnamed male dog, which was found tied up to a bin outside a Norfolk vet with a muzzle over his face, were so matted they had doubled in length and were seriously infected.

The dog was extremely thin, had sores all over his feet and his eyesight was so poor he could barely see.

The unnamed spaniel, which was found tied up to a bin, had to be put down because he was so unwell

RSPCA officers rescued the neglected pet in Sheringham on Saturday, but vets recommended he should put down.

RSPCA inspector John Jenkins said: 'This was a clear case of extreme neglect.

'I have never seen ears like it - they were so matted they had become as dense and solid as a horn.

'But it wasn't just the ears - this poor animal was in a very bad way all round and sadly there was nothing we could do to save him.

'We urge anyone with any information about who he belonged to and how he came to be in this state to come forward and let us know.'

Anyone with any information is asked to contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.

The spaniel was found tied up outside a vet in the seaside resort of Sheringham, Norfolk, on Saturday
