Father-of-six Mark Hughes lost everything when she came out as transgender women Abby-Grace.

Like boxing promoter Frank Maloney, Abby-Grace struggled to fight her feminine urges for years before making the transition.

When she eventually summoned the courage to come out, her parents disowned her and her oldest two daughters stopped speaking to her - but Abby says she's never been happier.

After years of feeling trapped in the wrong body, Mark (L) finally began living as Abby (R) 

The 47-year-old had known all of her life that she had the mind of a woman, but it wasn't until last year that she started living as one.

The Mancunian ex-window cleaner, who now lives in Idaho, America, has left her old life - and her children - behind to start afresh as Abby.

She says she 'cries every day' to be separated from her children, but her new life means that she hasn't seen them for almost a year.

'My children mean the world to me,' said Abby. 'I'd have stayed as Mark if that meant being with them but after I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria my ex-wife asked me to leave.

'If I hadn't transitioned I honestly think I would have died.

'I've had three nervous breakdowns and I'd even contemplated suicide because living as a man made me so miserable.

'It is difficult to be so far away from them but at least this way I'll see them grow up.

Speaking of Maloney, Abby said: 'I know exactly how she feels.

'It must have taken some courage for her to come out as transgender in such a macho industry.

'I've went through the same thing and I know how she must have suffered with it throughout her whole life.

'I wish her all the best and all of the luck in the world.'

Abby initially flew to the States on holiday, to recover after a breakdown in August last year.

She stayed with a transsexual friend, Dahlia, whom she had met online, but eventually decided that being in America was best for her recovery and never came back.

The only contact she has had with her children since has been over Skype.

Abby put her doubts to the back of her mind and went on to marry a woman called Winnie. When Abby was 25 her first daughter was born

But although the younger children, aged three, five, and seven, are more than happy to have Abby in their lives, her two oldest daughters, aged 18 and 16, refuse to have any contact with her.

'It's devastating," said Abby. 'I've never done anything but love them.

'But after I started living as a woman they didn't want anything to do with me.

'Because they're female, I thought they might be able to understand but they don't want to know.

'I just hope that as they get older and more mature they'll come around.'

For as long as Abby can remember, she was drawn to girls' clothes and toys but was made to feel guilty for her behaviour.

But Abby put her doubts to the back of her mind and continued to live as a man.

She went on to marry a woman called Winnie and their first daughter was born.

She said: 'We married and had three beautiful children, but all the while the stress and anxiety was slowly building.

'When I was 28 it all became too much and I had my first breakdown.

'Winnie and I drifted apart and after 12 years together we separated.'

After the breakdown of the marriage, Mark, then 35, met her second wife, Kelly, and the couple went on to have three sons.

Abby says that despite being disowned by her parents and two eldest daughters, she has never been happier (pictured right with transgendered friend Dahlia)

'I have always identified as bisexual but I was more attracted to women and have never been intimate with a man," said Abby.

'I fell madly in love with Kelly and I was desperate to have more children.'

In 2012, when she was 44, the dysphoria became unbearable and Abby had another breakdown.

It was so severe that Abby struggled to speak and couldn't even remember her children's names.

She knew that the time had finally come to confide in a doctor about what had been plaguing her for so many years.

In January 2013, Abby and Kelly separated and Abby, then 45, decided to take the plunge and start living full-time as a woman.

Despite losing contact with her parents and having to start a new life in America, Abby says she has never been happier

She started taking hormones and developed breasts within a few months.

But despite finally feeling comfortable in her skin, Abby struggled to be accepted by others.

She said: 'I briefly stayed with my sister in Huddersfield but she turned against me suddenly and kicked me out on the street.

'I had lost my job as a window cleaner when I had been ill and I was penniless.

'My parents didn't want to know and I had nowhere else to turn.

'Everyone had turned their back on me.'

In August 2013 Abby flew to America to start her new life.

She has now been taking hormones for over a year and has developed 36C breasts without surgery.

And despite being offered full funding for gender reassignment in the UK, she is paying the $17,000 fee for the operation in March next year using money from the sale of her house.

Abby said: 'I lived in the wrong body for over 40 years to keep other people happy and I almost killed myself in the process.

'But now I'm finally focusing on me.'
