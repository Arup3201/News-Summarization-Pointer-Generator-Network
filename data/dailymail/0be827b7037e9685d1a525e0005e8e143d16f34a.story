Hospitals across the Midwest are being inundated with children infected by a bizarre virus, which first comes on as a common cold before developing into severe respiratory distress.

In Kansas City, Missouri, about 450 children were recently treated at one facility - Children's Mercy Hospital - with at least 60 of them admitted to intensive care.

According to CNN Health, possible outbreaks have also been reported in Colorado, Illinois and Ohio.

Children's Mercy Hospital's division director for Infectious Diseases, Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, said the problem was 'big' and 'unprecedented'.

Close call: The parents of Will Cornejo, 13, feared their son would not make it after he struggled to breath this week and was rushed to Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver. He is one of hundreds of children being admitted to hospital for respiratory distress

Feared the worst: Jennifer Corneyjo said she didn't know to what to expect after her son Will went white and his lips turned blue as he struggled to breath

'I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,' Dr. Jackson told CNN.

'We've had to mobilize other providers, doctors, nurses. It's big. I would call it unprecedented.

'It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care.'

Dr. Jackson said the problem started around when school went back on August 17 and peaked between August 21 and 30.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that some 19 of the cases in Kansas City tested positive for Enterovirus D68 or EV-D68,  D68 or EV-D68, typically causes only mild asthma-like symptoms but can be more severe in some cases.

However there is no specific treatment for an EV-D68 infection, which is almost exclusively associated with respiratory disease.

Ventilation appears to be the best away to assist patients with the infection.

There is also no available vaccine.

There is currently no data for any deaths related to an EV-D68 infection in the United States.

Intense: Will required a breathing for 24 hours to help get enough oxygen into his lungs

'The full scope is yet to be known, but it would appear it's in the Midwest,' Dr. Jackson said.

'In our community (in Kansas City), meticulous hand-washing is not happening.

'It's just the nature of kids. Worst I've seen.'

Symptoms include fever, body and muscles aches, sneezing, coughing and rash, CNN reported.

Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver reported five children in their intensive care unit and 20 more in the pediatric unit.

Will Cornejo, 13, was among the children in intensive care after he came down with a cold last weekend.

His mother, Jennifer Corneyjo, said when her son took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, struggling to breath, she feared the worst.

'It was like nothing we've ever seen,' Jennifer Cornejo told CNN affiliate KUSA.

'He was unresponsive. He couldn't speak to me. He was turning white and his lips turned blue.'

Will needed a breathing aparatus for 24 hours.

Nationwide Children's Hopsital in East Columbus, Ohio, reported a 20 percent increase in patients with respiratory illness last weekend.

They are testing to see whether the cases are EV-D68.

Hannibal Regional Hospital in Hannibal, Missouri, said on Facebook they were dealth with 'recent outbreaks of enterovirus infections in Missouri and Illinois'.

Blessing Hospital in Quincy, Illinois, saw more than 70 children with respiratory issues last weekend, according to CNN affiliate WGEM.
