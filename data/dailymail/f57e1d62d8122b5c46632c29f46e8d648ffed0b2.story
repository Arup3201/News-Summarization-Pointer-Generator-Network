With less than four weeks until Christmas, thoughts are turning to shopping - and it seems that Brits are pulling out all the stops to get it done in time.

New research reveals that 2013 is set to be the year of the 'Santa Sickie' with 1.8 million Brits admitting they’re planning to call in sick at work in order to do their Christmas shopping - costing the economy £161m.

A fifth of Brits (22 per cent) now believe pulling a 'Santa Sickie' is acceptable if it means they can buy all of their gifts in time - that’s one million more people than in 2012.

With four weekends left to do their Christmas shopping, over a third of those planning a 'Santa Sickie' (36 per cent) feel forced to blag time off work to ensure they are home to collect deliveries.

A further third (34 per cent) claim they’ll skive work to avoid the busy shopping crowds in the weekends leading up to Christmas and one in five (21 per cent) say they plan to call in sick so they can shop in peace while their children are at school.

A packed social calendar and lack of time also plays a factor in the 'Santa Sickie' epidemic, with one in 14 (seven per cent) busy bees claiming they have to call in sick to get their shopping done because their weekends are taken up with seasonal socialising.

Birmingham has been crowned as the truanting capital; nearly one in five residents (19 per cent) plans to take a day off sick to ensure their Christmas shopping is complete.

Aberdeen emerges as the most honest city, with 95 per cent refusing to deceive their employer to finish the Christmas shopping.

Anita Naik, a spokesperson for VoucherCodes.co.uk who commissioned the research, said: 'It can sometimes seem impossible to fit in Christmas shopping on top of everything else that’s going on at this time of the year.

'The good news is, even if you haven’t started your shopping yet, you still have plenty of time to buy from both in-store and online.

'With the majority of big online retailers delivering orders placed as late as 23rd or 24th December, there really shouldn’t be any need to risk pulling a sickie day at work.'
