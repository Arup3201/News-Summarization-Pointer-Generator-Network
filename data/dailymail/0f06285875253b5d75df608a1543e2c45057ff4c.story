A mugger has been jailed for 11 years today for fatally injuring a pensioner as she tried to hold on to her bag as he snatched it from her.

Marvin Blake grabbed Carole Mudie's bag just yards from her home as she walked from her car after a night out at the bingo with friends.

The retired case worker, 68, was thrown to the ground clinging to her handbag.

The fall broke the grandmother’s hip - an injury which ultimately directly led to her death, as police were able to prove.

She had just £30 in her bag at the time.

Blake, 37, of no fixed address, was jailed after admitting manslaughter, robbing Mrs Mudie of her handbag and three further charges of theft at Birmingham Crown Court.

Mrs Mudie, who suffered with osteoporosis and sclerosis, died in hospital two weeks after the mugging, as a result of complications stemming from the shattered femur she sustained on the night of Sunday, January 6.

The grandmother, of Hawkesley, Birmingham, had won at the bingo that evening, texting her daughter the news and telling her the money was going 'in the pot' for a big family holiday in 2014.

Judge William Davis QC told Blake he had 'plainly targeted' Mrs Mudie, first walking up to her in her parked car under the auspices of going to ask her the time before later stalking up behind her to rip the handbag from her right arm, just yards from her doorstep.

'Inevitably she fell, while accepting it wasn't great violence in the sense you didn't then use violence when she was on the floor, you employed violence to get what you wanted,' he said.

The judge said Blake targeted Mrs Mudie when she was just yards from her home in Hawkmoor Gardens, Hawkesley, Birmingham

'All for £30 in her handbag and some personal effects.

'Sadly,
 although treated entirely properly at hospital the serious injuries you
 caused her led to complications and a couple of weeks later she died.

'And that death has caused huge upset, grief and trauma to the family she left behind.

'Not just her son and daughter, but her grandchildren.'

Days before the fatal robbery, Blake had snatched purses from other long elderly women, aged 73 and 82, while they shopped. He also pulled a 60-year-old woman from her delivery van to steal her sat-nav.

Stephen Linehan, Blake's barrister, offered as mitigation his client's 'courageous' decision to admit to robbery and manslaughter, without first conferring with his counsel.

'He has destroyed a complete, fantastic family. She idolised her grandchildren, and she had a fantastic sense of humour - she was great fun,'

Cary Healey, Carole Mudie's daughter

'He is genuinely remorseful, penitent and recognises his actions have caused enormous suffering,' he added.

Judge Davis said his offending was of 'very grave seriousness' and had left his other victims nervous, anxious and upset, with one nearly giving up her job as a result of the frightening experience, while another had sought medical help.

Cary Healey, Mrs Mudie's daughter, said Blake had 'destroyed a complete, fantastic family' adding she felt nothing but hatred for the man.

After the hearing, Mrs Healey said the family could now get on with grieving for their loss with Blake behind bars.

She said: 'I am pleased (with the sentence) for the safety of others. It's not going to bring my mum back, but other people will be safer.

'She was my best friend, we went everywhere together, we watched all the same television programmes.

'She had a huge circle of friends - went on holiday with the girls, went out weekly with the girls.

'She idolised her grandchildren, and she had a fantastic sense of humour - she was great fun.'

Mrs Healey added: 'She'd been out with friends - she'd go to bingo every Sunday and I usually got a text telling me how much she had won.

Mrs Mudie was returning home from a night at bingo when she was mugged by Blake

'And she had won that night, so it was all going in the pot for her next holiday.'

Following sentencing, West Midlands Police's Detective Sergeant Andy Bradley, senior investigating officer, described the crime as 'particularly abhorrent' for Blake, who preyed solely on elderly women.

He said: 'I'm glad the judge has recognised the severity of Blake's offences, and he's going to be behind bars for a considerable time.

'He was a man who targeted elderly and vulnerable victims, going to places like shops, post offices, care homes, and who relied on sleight-of-hand to commit crime without being noticed.

'But if found out he had no compunction in using violence to commit his crimes.

'In this case, he knocked over Carole Mudie so severely she broke her hip, and ultimately she died from those injuries.'

He added: 'It is a particularly abhorrent crime - those are the only words I can use, and I am just glad for Mrs Mudie's family that we have caught him and got him behind bars and that is the best result we could hope for.'

Jailing Blake, Judge Davis also ordered a seven-year extension to the licence period for the offence of manslaughter, telling him he would be under the watchful eye of the authorities for 18 years.

For the offences of theft, committed on December 27, and December 28, 2012, and January 3, 2013, he imposed a year in prison for each of the counts, and a four-year sentence for the robbery, to be served concurrently.
