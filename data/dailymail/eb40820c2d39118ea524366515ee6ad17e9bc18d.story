Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has joked that the intense strengthening programme he was put on in his early days at the club left him feeling like 'Captain America'.

De Gea underwent a brutal regime after joining United as a skinny 20-year-old and he was in the gym three mornings per week at 9.30am and also had extra afternoons sessions twice a week.

'I was like Captain America in one year (laughs)!' the keeper said in an interview with the club website.

'I still do the programme, although not as much as before. It is more of a reduced programme now but certainly I did a lot of gym work at the start and it did have a big impact.'

De Gea has been in outstanding form this season and he also believes that his improving level of English has contributed to his performances. 

The Spaniard did study the language at school but struggled to communicate with fluency early on at United. He is now in a position where he is able to conduct interviews in English.

'I actually think the biggest impact is when you are in the dressing room. You need it on the field as well, of course, but you need it in the dressing room. 

The Spaniard has transformed into one of Manchester United's most important players this season 

The 24-year-old was the man of the match against Liverpool in early December after making some fine saves

'I think the fact that I have started to do interviews in English has really helped as well, it has helped me to learn more of the language as well.'

De Gea, whose United contract expires in 18 months' time, has thwarted opponents across the country in the first half of this campaign but he has warned that the best is still to come.

He added: 'No matter how excellent your form is, you can always get better and there are always aspects of your game that you can improve.

'You can improve everything. No matter how well people think you are playing, or how well you think you are playing yourself, it is always a case of working on every facet of your game. There is hopefully more to come.'
