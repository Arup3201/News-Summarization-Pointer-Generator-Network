Kathryn Braidford was the last person anyone suspected of stealing dinner money from a primary school

Living in a £650,000 detached house and married to a successful financial adviser, Kathryn Braidford was universally regarded as a pillar of society.

So when children's dinner money started going missing at the primary school where she served as a parent-governor, the former British Airways hostess was the last person anyone suspected.

Riven by speculation as to which member of staff was the thief, the headmistress installed a hidden camera - and to her horror, the much-respected mother-of-three was captured removing a bag of money which never reached the bank.

It emerged she had even helped herself to £170 which the headmistress had put aside for her Lottery syndicate.

Questioned as to why she should risk throwing her reputation away for such modest sums, she could only tell police she had been using the money 'to go shopping'.

Yesterday the 46-year-old's humiliation was complete as she admitted stealing over £3,400 from the school where she had helped out three days a week in the office.

Her 'mortified' husband Steven - the £100,000-a-year managing director of a wealth management company - watched as she admitted seven counts of theft.

Braidford, whose elder two children are privately educated, became a governor at Breck Primary School in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, after her younger child began attending classes, a court heard.

She later took on a part-time job as an administrative assistant with duties which included being entrusted with cash and cheques sent by fellow parents for school dinners, trips, uniform, social events and out-of-hours clubs.

Once a week she was meant to bank the money, Blackpool Magistrates Court was told.

'One day a brown envelope containing £300 for pupils' school photographs went missing,' Jane Yates, prosecuting, said.

'That was followed by the disappearance of £170 which was headmistress Mrs Cheryl Brindle's money for the Lottery syndicate.'

The court heard that the school was torn apart, with both staff and pupils under suspicion, so last summer a CCTV system was secretly installed to catch the thief.

Footage showed Braidford removing a bag of money from a desk, and after checks established the cash had never been banked, police searched her detached home 'Normandy' on an exclusive lane in Poulton.

She then produced school bank account cheques and paying in slips from a desk.

Interviewed by officers, she had used some of the money 'to go shopping and pay for food' She said she had wanted to stop stealing and pay the money back but had not done so. She thought it was school money and she was not robbing an individual.

In all, the school lost £3,434 over an eight-month period.

In a victim's statement, headmistress Mrs Brindle said she had trusted Braidford and had never suspected she would prove to be the thief.

'I was saddened when I had to install CCTV,' she said. 'This is a primary school and I should be dealing with education and not having an environment where all the staff and pupils were suspects.

'I had real affection for Mrs Braidford and trusted her. I suspected people but not her.

'There was real angst in the school over this period and pupils were no longer allowed to go in areas or complete tasks they formerly did.' Leisa Splaine, defending, said that while Braidford and her husband were 'comfortably off', she had felt 'invisible' and had low self-esteem.
