Detectives at Scotland Yard lent Rebekah Brooks (pictured at the Newbury Races last year) a police horse which she acted as a 'foster carer' for

The retired police horse loaned to Rebekah Brooks was returned to the Met Police in a 'poor condition', the force said today.

The former Sun editor 'fostered' the animal, called Raisa, when it retired from active service with Scotland Yard and returned it in 2010.

But the 43-year-old, who rode the horse at her farm in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, returned the animal to the Met in a worse condition than when she received it.

Following the news that Brooks had been loaned the horse, Rupert Murdoch leapt to the defence of the former News International boss.

Murdoch tweeted this morning: 'Now they are complaining about R Brooks saving an old horse from the glue factory!'

Scotland Yard said that Ms Brooks, a keen rider, was given permission to take charge of the horse in 2008.

But after acting as a 'foster carer' for the animal for two years, she returned it in a 'poor condition', said a spokesman.

He said: 'In 2007 a request was made by Rebekah Brooks to home a retired police horse.

'Mounted Branch conducted the normal property and welfare inspection, which was passed. As a result 22-year-old retired horse Raisa was loaned to Rebekah Brooks in 2008.

'The MPS was contacted in early 2010 by an individual on behalf of Rebekah Brooks who asked the MPS to re-home Raisa, which was then 24, due to the horse no longer being ridden.

'When the horse was returned Raisa was regarded by officers from Mounted Branch to be in a poor but not serious condition.'

Raisa later died of natural causes.

The claims that Raisa was mistreated were today fiercely denied by Mrs Brooks's husband Charlie.

According to the Evening Standard, renowned racehorse trainer Mr Brooks said: 'I have been around and looked after horses all my life and I am confident that I know more about caring for them than people at the Metropolitan police.'

Despite Mr Murdoch's public backing of Brooks, the 80-year-old media tycoon's staunch defence was rubbished by some critics.

Labour MP Tom Watson, who famously grilled Murdoch and his son James at the Home Affairs select committee in July, replied to Rupert Murdoch's tweet saying: 'You comment on her horse but not on her insider knowledge of a criminal investigation into your company. Have you no shame?'

Most of the Met's police horses are retired with The Horse Trust charity in Buckinghamshire.

Brooks, a keen rider, is married to racehorse trainer and Old Etonian Charlie Brooks.

A friend told the Evening Standard yesterday: 'Rebekah acted as a foster carer for the horse. Anybody can agree to do this with the Met if they have the land and facilities to pay for its upkeep.'

The Leveson inquiry into press ethics has heard that the relationship between News International and the Met was 'at best inappropriately close and at worst corrupt'.

The inquiry also heard yesterday how the Met tipped off Brooks in 2006 about the original phone-hacking investigation at the News of the World, where she was editor from 2000 to 2003.

She was arrested on July 15 last year as part of both Operation Weeting, which is investigating phone hacking, and Operation Elevden, the investigation into police corruption.

Brooks is bailed to return for questioning by police in March. Her lawyer has said she denies committing any criminal offence.

It has been claimed that Brooks, who 
resigned from News International in the wake of the phone hacking 
scandal, was a horse-riding companion of Prime Minister David Cameron 
but she denies this.

Lord Blair said he was not aware of the gift. 

Brooks's spokesman, David Wilson, from Bell Pottinger confirmed the deal took place. 'Rebekah acted as a foster carer for the horse.'

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman added: 'When a police horse reaches the end of its working life, Mounted Branch officers find it a suitable retirement home.

'Whilst responsibility for feeding the animal and paying vet bills passes to the person entrusted with its care, the horse remains the property of the Metropolitan Police Service.

'Retired police horses are not sold 
on and can be returned to the care of the MPS at any time. In 2008 a 
retired horse was loaned to Rebekah Brooks. The horse was re-housed with
a police officer in 2010.'

The
horse borrowed by Ms Brooks was one of 12 retired by the force in 2008.
A further 29 had their duties ended between 2009 and 2011.

Scotland Yard declined to give details or the name of the horse taken into Ms Brooks' care.

A
spokesman added: 'When rehoming a retired MPS horse, the appropriate 
welfare checks are carried out by mounted branch officers.'

The Brookses, who married in June 2009, live in a sprawling property in Chipping Norton, barely a mile from David Cameron’s £750,000 constituency home in Dean, near Charlbury.

In one of the most scenic parts of England - the Cotswolds - it is at the heart of what has become known as the 'Chipping Norton Set'.

Last year it was reported that the group, which also includes Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, often went  to the same house parties and dined together.

Brooks became a mother to a baby girl born via surrogate earlier this month.

One of Tony Blair’s closest allies today admitted that New Labour was 'too keen to curry favour' with Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.

Former Cabinet minister Lord Falconer said the 'much-too-cosy relationship' may have been emulated by police chiefs and other public servants who were then drawn into the Murdoch net. He also confirmed that policies were adopted to suit the political bias of the Murdoch press.

'I do worry now that we were too keen to curry favour,' the former Lord Chancellor said on Radio 4.

'It’s not remotely inconceivable that because the politicians thought it was okay to court News International, other public officials followed. I don’t mean the explicit corruption that Deputy Assistant Commissioner [Sue] Akers described yesterday. I mean the much-too-cosy relationships that were formed where... what went onto the political agenda or what was reported about what the police did was determined by that relationship.'

The peer said that the appointment of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as David Cameron’s media adviser was another regrettable example of over-cosy relations.

He said Labour began courting NI because it blamed hostile coverage in The Sun for its 1992 defeat. 'What followed was a too-determined attempt to get News International on-side.'
