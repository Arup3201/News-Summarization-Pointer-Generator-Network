A gorilla sculpture dressed in a famous Freddie Mercury costume has been removed from  Norwich city centre after a charity claimed the animal's suit breached copyright.

The sculpture - dressed in the Queen frontman's iconic yellow costume-  was one of 53 differently designed apes
 which have taken up residence at sites across the city as part of the 
GoGoGorillas! Project to help raise vital funds for charity.

But it was removed today after the Mercury Phoenix Trust, an Aids charity set up in memory of the singer who died in 1991, said it may take legal action.

It asked that the sculpture, called Freddie 'Radio Go Go' Gorilla, be removed and repainted.

Organisers of the charity art trail, which is raising funds for Break, which supports children, young people and families across East Anglia, and Born Free's project to help lowland gorillas in the Congo, removed the sculpture today.

The animals have been produced by local artists over the past year and will be auctioned at the end of the 10-week trail on September 7.

The sculpture was painted by local man Mik Richardson - talking about the sculpture before the copyright storm, Mr Richardson said: 'I am an avid fan of the group QUEEN and the spark for this design was in the title of 'GO GO GORILLAS' it made me think of the song 'Radio Ga Ga' and that's how easy it came to me. I then thought of the most iconic outfit that Freddy Mercury wore and added the 'Flash' T-shirt for good measure.'

Charlie Langhorne, director of Wild in Art, the company that created the trail, said it had been contacted by the Mercury Phoenix Trust.

'They just said that they own the copyright on the suit and asked us to change it,' Mr Langhorne said.

'That's being sorted. To save any bother we will change it.

'We do quite a few bits and pieces for them but it's no great shakes. We would rather not have to do it but it's not the end of the world.'

He said the gorilla would be removed and repainted with a 'new and exciting design' and should be back in place within 10 days.

'People in Norwich will have a new gorilla to enjoy soon,' he said.

Martin Green of Break, one of two charities that will benefit from the auction of the gorillas once the exhibition is over, said: 'It's a disappointing position they have put us in.

'This is charity and everything we have done was with good intention. Our hands are tied.'

The Mercury Phoenix Trust was unavailable for comment.

Based on a western lowland gorilla, each sculpture stands about 5ft (1.5m) tall and weighs about half a tonne.

A number of teams, using fork-lift trucks, took four hours to install the gorillas, which went on show at the end of June.

Other gorillas on the trail include champion cyclist Bradley Wiggins and BBC sports presenter Jake Humprey.
