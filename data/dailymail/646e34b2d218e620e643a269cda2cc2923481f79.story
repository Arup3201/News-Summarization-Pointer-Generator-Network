The first atomic bomb test in July 16, 1945 marks the beginning of the Anthropocene – a new chapter of the Earth’s geological history, an international group of scientists has proposed.

They say that humans are having such a marked impact on the Earth that we are changing its geology, to create distinctive new layers of rock and soil.

The use of nuclear weapons, and their nuclear fallout, has left an indelible mark, combined with a ‘great acceleration’ of other human activity.

The first atomic bomb test in July 16, 1945 marks the beginning of the Anthropocene – a new chapter of the Earth’s geological history, an international group of scientists has proposed.

The new geological epoch - the name of which means the human epoch - was proposed by Nobel Prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen just 15 years ago, and since then the idea has caught on.

However, the precise date it began is being debated by experts.

Jan Zalasiewicz a geology professor at the University of Leicester, said: ‘Like any geological boundary, it is not a perfect marker – levels of global radiation really rose in the early 1950s, as salvoes of bomb tests took place.

‘But it may be the optimal way to resolve the multiple lines of evidence on human-driven planetary change. Time - and much more discussion - will tell.’

Experts have debated when the Anthropocene should begin, because humans have been affecting the environment for thousands of years – during the Industrial Revolution in 18th century England, for example.

The first atomic bomb test took place on July 16, 1945 at the US Army’s test range in Alamogordo, New Mexico.

Scientists say that that first blast marks the beginning of a new geological epoch – the Anthropocene.

While other dates are being discussed, a working group claims this historical landmark is appropriate because nuclear tests and weapons have left an indelible mark on the Earth by changing its geology.

A ‘great acceleration’ of population, carbon emissions, species invasions and extinctions and the production of concrete, plastics and metals in vast quantities, since that date, also makes it appropriate.

But members of the working group have suggested the turning point happened in the mid-twentieth century.

This was when humans did not just leave traces of their actions, but began to alter the whole Earth system.

There was a ‘great acceleration’ of population, of carbon emissions, of species invasions and extinctions, of earth moving, of the production of concrete, plastics and metals, they said.

It included the start, too, of the nuclear age, when artificial radionuclides were scattered across the Earth,to leave a detectable signal in modern strata virtually everywhere on the planet.

Dr Zalasiewicz, who chairs the Anthropocene working group set up by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, said the Anthropocene could be considered to be drawn at the moment of detonation of the world’s first nuclear test.

The proposal has been signed by 26 members of the group, created by the body that oversees changes to the geological timeline.

The beginning of the nuclear age marks the historic turning point when humans first accessed an enormous new energy source - and is also a time level that can be effectively tracked within geological strata – layers of rocks and soil.

The start of the nuclear age, which coincides with the beginning of widely used and thrown away plastic objects (illustrated with a stock image), can be effectively tracked within geological strata – layers of rocks and soil, the experts said

The date at which the Anthropocene started is the subject of debate. A total of 26 members of a working party that have backed it to begin at the start of atominc testing, but the beginning of the Industrial revolution was mulled too.

Previous ‘divisions’ between geological eras have been marked by 'spikes' in the geological records, caused by global catastrophes such as the asteroid strike thought to be responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs, or a wave of volcanic eruptions.

Dr Zalasiewicz said: ‘Like any geological boundary, it is not a perfect marker – levels of global radiation really rose in the early 1950s, as salvoes of bomb tests took place.

‘But it may be the optimal way to resolve the multiple lines of evidence on human-driven planetary change. Time - and much more discussion - will tell.’

This year, the Anthropocene Working Group will put together more evidence on the new geological epoch, including discussion of possible alternative time boundaries.

In 2016, the group aims to make recommendations on whether this new time unit should be formalised and, if so, how it might be defined and characterised.
