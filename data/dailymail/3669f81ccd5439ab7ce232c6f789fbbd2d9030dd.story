Everton's worst fears about Kevin Mirallas have been realised as the Belgium forward faces up to eight weeks on the sidelines.

Mirallas pulled up sharply during Everton’s 1-1 draw with Liverpool on Saturday and left the field on a stretcher; manager Roberto Martinez immediately said after the game that the signs 'did not look good'.

He was sent for scans on Sunday and subsequently had more tests on Tuesday to determine the full extent of the damage. It is understood that Mirallas is now not expected to return before December.

A lay-off of that length would equate to him having suffered a grade two tear of his hamstring.

It is a huge blow for Martinez and Everton, as Mirallas has been in excellent form since the start of the season and had scored three goals in seven appearances.

The 26-year-old will now be denied the opportunity to play against his former club Lille in the Europa League at the end of this month, as well missing up to six Barclays Premier League fixtures, starting with this Sunday’s trip to Manchester United.

When Mirallas first joined Everton in 2012, he suffered a number of hamstring problems but last season he turned things around and was virtually ever present before going on to help Belgium reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup.

News of Mirallas' injury will come as a major blow to Roberto Martinez's first team plans 

Martinez has praised the work Mirallas has done to improve his fitness and the former Olympiakos striker admitted recently that he was in his best physical condition, now that he had fully adjusted to the demands of English football.

Mirallas said: ‘When I came here from Greece at first I struggled because the leagues are totally different. Here it is all about possession, about running up and down, it’s non-stop all the time. I was getting very tired when I first arrived but now I feel totally different about things – I feel very good.

‘It’s my third season here and each one it has got better. The players have improved, we’ve improved as a team every year.’
