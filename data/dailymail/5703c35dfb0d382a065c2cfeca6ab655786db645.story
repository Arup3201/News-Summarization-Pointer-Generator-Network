In 1986, an 11-year-old girl called Lisa sent a letter to President Ronald Reagan asking him to sponsor her in a charity event to help the homeless.

The world's most powerful man personally replied to the San Fernando girl with a handwritten note and attached a check for $50, both of which are to be offered up for sale for $20,000.

The Gipper's check - which is the only known one signed by him in existence - was never cashed by the girl after her parents replaced it with cash and told her to keep it and the heartfelt note for posterity.

Handwritten: This is the letter sent to Lisa to by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 on a White House letterhead

'Dear Lisa, I am very proud to sponsor you in the walkathon,' wrote Reagan on a White House letterhead on August 26, 1986.

'Thank you for asking. I know you’ll walk the seven miles and the enclosed is to help the cause you are serving. God bless you. Ronald Reagan.'

Lisa, who is now a grown woman and wishes to remain anonymous, was running in an event to help the homeless organized by San Fernando Board of Realtors scheduled for September 27, 1986.

The documents are being handled through auction by The Raab Collection and Nathan Raab said that the letter and check from Reagan's own personal Bank of America account will only increase in value.

'This little-known episode in Reagan's life shows the kind of man he was and is a testament to his character,' Raab told FoxNews.com.

'He cared enough that when he received a letter and request from a young child, the president devoted not only his valuable time as president, but also his personal funds to her.'

Raab said that a search of public and private records have failed to reveal any other checks signed by the 40th president - making the documents almost unique.

'You almost never seen letters of presidents to children,' said Raab told FoxNews.com.

'The piece is a great rarity, and also evocative of Reagan the man and Reagan the President.'

At the time that Reagan sent the check and letter he was coming under criticism for being 'indifferent' towards the plight of the homeless.

According to records from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Library, on the day that he replied to Lisa he was in Los Angeles running errands and spending time with friends.

'Into L.A. for our few days of seeing friends, etc.,' Reagan wrote.

'We left the house at 10:40 a.m. and arrived at the suite at 11:45. Coming down the coast in a helicopter I watched for landmarks I remembered and was a little upset when I could locate them & then couldn’t remember their names, Topanga Canyon for example.

'After lunch a haircut and manicure, both overdue.'
