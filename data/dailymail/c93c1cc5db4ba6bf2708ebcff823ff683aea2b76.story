By the time referee Wayne Barnes blew the final whistle, large chunks of the world-record crowd had long since drifted away into the north London night.

Such was Saracens’ dominance of a Harlequins team who have completely lost their way, even the dubious lure of a Mexican wave had lost its appeal for the ‘away’ fans.

Those left inside did muster a roar when Billy Vunipola dotted down for a deserved try with two minutes remaining, but Quins had been so inept for large parts of this game that a five-try victory felt slightly hollow.

Saracens won’t care a jot. They were tack sharp for much of the game, physical and confrontational when they needed to be with a pack more than willing to mix it and a back line full of invention.

It was just a shame the 84,068 crowd, many of them no doubt watching their first game of professional rugby, witnessed such a no-contest. Saracens have won all but one of their last 14 matches against their London rivals and on this evidence it will be a long time before they are troubled again.

Quins, eighth in the Aviva Premiership table and with next to no chance of European qualification, really were that bad.

Their returning England contingent of Chris Robshaw, Joe Marler and Nick Easter were unable to make any notable impact up front, while behind the scrum they were devoid of ideas.

They missed the cutting edge of their concussed full back Mike Brown and scrum-half Danny Care is badly short of confidence after being dropped by England last autumn.

The same cannot be said of Saracens, who consolidated their second spot in the table with a bonus-point win that saw winger Chris Ashton score an excellent brace. USA centre Chris Wyles excelled at 12 alongside the equally impressive Marcelo Bosch. With Owen Farrell, Brad Barritt and Schalk Brits set to return from injury soon, Saracens appear to be coming good at the right time.

‘The second 20 minutes of the first half was as good as we’ve been all season,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We counter attacked really well and looked dangerous on the ball. We went off the boil in the next 20 minutes but put a lot of pressure on towards the end.’

The only blot on Ashton’s copybook was the yellow card shown for a tip tackle on Matt Hopper with eight minutes to play. No matter. Saracens still scored two tries with the wing off the field.

‘It’s incredibly frustrating,’ said Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea. ‘We’re just too easy to knock off. It’s been a really difficult couple of months. You can see that by how easily we get knocked off our stride, mentally. When you are used to success it hurts even more.’

It could all have been so different for Quins. On the same Wembley pitch where Harry Kane had taken just 78 seconds to open his international account for England the night before, young Quins flanker Jack Clifford dotted down 28 seconds into this contest after charging down Neil de Kock’s clearance. It proved to be as good as it would get for Quins as Wyles and Ashton scored superbly worked first-half tries.

Quins lost prop Kyle Sinckler with a knee injury sustained courtesy of a dubious tackle by flanker Jacques Burger.

Ashton’s 52nd-minute try put Saracens out of sight before the two more late tries put deserved gloss on the score. They will travel to face Racing Metro in the last eight of Europe next Sunday full of belief.
