Police yesterday admitted that three murderers – one of whom went on the run 17 years ago – are among almost 90 inmates missing from a notorious open jail.

Last week, a row erupted after it emerged that a staggering 88 convicts had absconded from HMP Ford in West Sussex without being recaptured.

Now Sussex Police, which kept many of the cases secret for years, have issued a belated appeal to try to catch some of the men.

Killers: Timothy O'Leary, 59 (left) was jailed for murder in September 1981 but walked out of Ford Open Prison in 1997. Robert Donovan (right) was jailed for life in 1974 for stabbing a man to death in the street in London

Dangerous: Derek Passmore (left), who murdered a
 man in the street in 1996, walked out of the prison last June. Police 
are also searching for 48-year-old post office robber David Blood 
(right), who left Ford last week

They include Timothy O’Leary, 59, who 
walked out of Ford as long ago as 1997. O’Leary, who also used the name 
Timothy McCarthy, was jailed for life for the murder of a fellow 
traveller in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, in September 1981.

Other
 wanted killers include Robert Donovan, 57, who was jailed for life in 
1974 for stabbing a man to death in the street in the West End of London
 when he was 17.

He left Ford prison on day release in June 2010 but police only issued a first appeal to find him last week.

Also
 on the list is Derek Passmore, 49, who walked out of the prison in June
 last year on day release. He was serving life for the brutal murder of 
Paul Craig while in a jealous rage in a street in Hampton, West London, 
in October 1996.

Nick Gibb, the Tory MP whose constituency covers Ford, 
expressed alarm at the number of criminals who are absconding from the 
open prison, which has previously been described as a ‘holiday camp’.

Police are seeking Steven Evans, 55 (left) who was jailed for life in February 2003 for a pre-meditated assault on a man with a metal bar in a car park in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. Craig Hayler (right) disappeared in March 

Under fire: Last week it emerged 90 inmates were on the run from Ford Open Prison. Two have been found

‘I’m worried about how prisoners are chosen to be sent to Ford open prison, and that too many are absconding,’ he said.

‘The
 theory is that these are prisoners who are coming to the end of their 
sentences and therefore should no longer be at risk of absconding. The 
risk assessment of prisoners who are being sent to Ford is clearly not 
vigorous enough.’

Despite 88 criminals being on-the-run from Ford, police only released the identities of eight.

Superintendent
 Lawrence Hobbs said: ‘We have assessed the cases of every prisoner who 
is currently wanted after absconding from Ford prison ... We have no 
evidence that any of these men are a danger to the public but because of
 the offences they have previously committed we cannot rule it out.

‘We need the public’s help to track them down and return them to custody.’

Review: The prison in West Sussex is designed for offenders who are coming towards the end of their terms

Derbyshire Police disclosed today that a prisoner has absconded from HMP Sudbury.

Michael
 Fien McCarthy (right), who was convicted last year of wounding with 
intent, went missing from the Category D prison overnight.

The 24-year-old is described as white, 5ft 11ins tall, of medium build, with short blond hair and blue eyes.

He has an Irish accent and his last known address is in Hyson Green, Nottingham.

Others
 on the list published yesterday include 48-year-old post office robber 
David Blood who left Ford on June 12 this year, and Steven Evans, 55, 
who was jailed for life in February 2003 for assaulting a man with a 
metal bar in a car park in Southend, Essex.

He has previous convictions 
for robbery, wounding and firearms offences and absconded in March 2013,
 a police spokesman said.

Craig
 Hayler, 30, disappeared on March 10 this year. He was jailed for 30 
months for a burglary in Hove, in December 2012. Arben Nuredini, 39, 
also known as Arben Alizoti, was jailed for seven years in  2004 for 
wounding.

He absconded from Ford in January 2005.

Police
 also want to trace Christopher Street, 62, who absconded in November 
2001.

He was jailed for seven years in August 1999 after being convicted
 of conspiracy to rob and firearms offences.

Meanwhile,
 Derbyshire police disclosed yesterday that a prisoner has absconded 
from HMP Sudbury. Michael Fien McCarthy, who was jailed last year for 
wounding with intent, went missing overnight.

Controversy
 has been raging for two months over convicts absconding from open 
jails.

It was sparked by the disappearance of an armed robber known as 
the Skull Cracker.

Michael 
Wheatley, 55, walked out of Standford Hill open prison in Kent last 
month, and held up a building society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey.

He 
was later caught and given his 14th life sentence.

Ministers
 said inmates should no longer be transferred to open jails or allowed 
on temporary release if they had absconded before.
