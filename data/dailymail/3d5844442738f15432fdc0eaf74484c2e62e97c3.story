She was rushed to hospital on Friday morning after what was first suspected as an overdose but later diagnosed as 'exhaustion and dehydration'.

But just two days later, Brooke Mueller appeared determined to get back to normal and looked happy and relaxed as she took her twin sons to a friend's wedding in Los Angeles.

The smiling 35-year-old, who has a long history of drug abuse, escorted the three-year-old boys to the ceremony in Los Angeles and helped them scatter flowers along the wedding walkway.

The ex-wife of Charlie Sheen sported a pair of loose fitting black trousers and a slinky grey shawl, while sons Bob and Max looked smart in white suits.

The outing comes just two days after Mueller was rushed to hospital in what was initially thought to be an overdose.

However, Mueller's publicist spoke out to claim that no drugs were involved.

Instead,
Steve Honig said in a statement that Brooke was mistakenly believed to 
be unresponsive while sleeping, telling MailOnline: 'An assistant thought
Brooke was non-responsive while she was napping and hastily called an 
ambulance.

'As a precaution, Brooke was brought 
to a local hospital and discharged after an hour. She was diagnosed with
exhaustion and dehydration and is now fine and resting at home. That's 
it.'

But in a video posted on TMZ, Brooke was seen leaving the hospital after being discharged with 
blackened hands, leading to speculation that she had been using crack 
cocaine and burnt herself.

But the socialite claimed that her hands were in fact covered in spray paint from an art project.

The troubled mother-of two also blamed her exhaustion on a line of jewellery making sheâ€™s been making for her new boyfriend jeweller Pascal Mouawad with whom she was having dinner at Mr Chow's the night before the incident.

'See? Look,' she said, clutching a wad of trinkets with mysteriously blackened fingertips. 'Jewellery. Everywhere is jewellery.'

The previous evening she was seen looking glassy-eyed as she stepped out of a car upon her arrival at the Beverly Hills restaurant.

Sources
reportedly told the website that people around Brooke are 'deeply 
concerned' and alleged that she had been 'taking drugs for several weeks',
it was claimed.

But Brooke is so determined to prove she was clean, she told Radar Online: 'I am going back to the hospital to get the test results that will prove that I wasn't on drugs.'

For
her meal out on Thursday night, Brooke went for a boho look, sporting a
jewelled headband and a leather jacket, trousers and studded boots.

Meanwhile, it was reported that the toddlers were in the care of Mueller's live-in nanny during her hospital dash.

Sources told TMZ that the caretaker looked after the tots during the former real estate agent's absence.

The
boys stayed at Mueller's house with the nanny, who has lived in the 
household for several years, and did not go to their father Sheen's 
house nor were put under the care of the actor's other ex-wife Denise 
Richards, who has looked after them in the past.

Brooke was placed on probation for one year after she plead guilty to possession of cocaine on March 19.

The Witchouse actress and mother-of-two has been in rehab multiple times.

Brooke married Charlie Sheen in May 2008 and gave birth to their twin sons Bob and Max nine months later.

Charlie filed for divorce from Brooke in November 2010, and the pair's divorce became effective the following June.
