These are the haunting shoebox-sized rooms inspired an artist’s childhood exploring the bombed out homes of the Blitz.

Using scenes just 12 inches high photographer Graeme Webb has created magical apocalyptic-like scenes of nature reclaiming living rooms.

Graeme, 60, from London, can take 15 to 20 hours making a single scene using everything from dolls house furniture to using sprigs of herbs like thyme.

Haunting reminders: The shoebox-sized rooms inspired by artist Graeme Webb's childhood exploring the bombed-out homes of the Blitz

Apocalyptic: The scenes mess with scale, with a window and a chair dwarfing the perplexed man who has just arrived on the scene

His work has already got the attention of art galleries seeing him exhibit across London and now he wants to share his work online with a downloadable ebook ‘Bleak House and Other Places, The Dioramas 2008 - 2012’.

Made from day-to-day objects with dazzling effect, the dioramas cost just £5 to £6 to make but look immaculate even though same of the greenery is created from shredded carpet underlay.

Graeme admits he only rekindled a passion for photography in the last five years having worked most of his life in post-production on animations and films.

Graeme said despite the bleak seeming nature of his scenes, which he gets much of the material for from 4D Modelshop, he is actually a cheery person.

Clever: Graeme Webb, pictured, can take 15 to 20 hours making a single scene using everything from dolls house furniture to using sprigs of herbs like thyme

Incredible: The scenes are just 12 inches high but contain incredible detail like this tree, chairs and table

Creative: Miniature people walk across a damaged piano in this scene

Inspired: Graeme says the art is linked to the bombed-out homes he played in in 1950s Greenwich

He said: 'A lot of people look at them and think I must be so miserable but that couldn’t be further from the truth.

'I’ve always had a fascination with the derelict and often tried to photograph it but I find that these scenes allow me to get across what I couldn’t out in reality.

'A lot of people think the windows in my pictures are like a window on the soul but it’s more about a system of lighting the scene originally.

Painstaking: The photographer and artist puts in an incredible amount of detail into every scene he creates

Art: These images show the intricate work he puts in on every piece he creates

Recognised: Graeme's work has already got the attention of art galleries seeing him exhibit across London

Hot: Within this shattered and decrepit property a small and tidy beach is created in this scene

'I think there’s a sense of anything could be going on the other side of that window but inside the room there’s a different world.'

Graeme said a lot of the inspiration for his work came from dreams he’d had from his childhood.

He said: 'During the 50s as a child we would play in bombed-out houses from the Blitz in Greenwich, there is something of those houses in my work.'
