Fewer than 10 days into his term as New York City mayor and Bill de Blasio is already defending himself after his first scandal: being caught eating his pizza with a knife and fork.

A photograph of de Blasio using utensils spread across Twitter and prompted mock outrage among New Yorkers on blogs and news sites.

Responding to the pizza palaver, de Blasio defended the approach, saying that his Italian ancestry is behind his decidedly un-New York pizza-eating style.

Put a fork in him: de Blasio earned the disapproval of New Yorkers when he ate a slice with a knife and fork at Goodfellas, Staten Island

'In my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife. And I have been in Italy a lot and I’ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,' he said.

It's a method New Yorkers have variously described as 'blasphemous,' a 'cardinal sin,' and 'unacceptable' on Twitter.

As any New Yorker knows, the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands.

The incident, already dubbed 'Forkgate,' happened at Staten Island pizza joint Goodfellas Friday, where de Blasio stopped in for lunch with local business owners.

The owner of Goodfellas, which was a favorite spot of former mayor Rudy Giuliani, wasn't sold on the mayor's method either.

'I think he’s just trying to be polite,' Scot Costentino said. 'We’ll talk to him on the side about that,' he added.

Hand it to him: de Blasio did eventually pick up his slice

Proving he is not a complete heathen, though, de Blasio explained that he likes to use his hands too.

His method is a combination of the Italian and New York styles, he said, describing it as 'very complicated.'

'I often start with a knife and fork. But then I cross over to the American approach and  pick it up when I go farther into the pizza,' he told a reporter who questioned his methods, adding that the inquiry was a 'very important question.'

Charles Greinsky witnessed the incident and is not letting his longstanding friendship with the mayor get in the way of what's right.

One of us: Conservative pals Donald Trump and Sarah Palin made news in 2011 when they stepped out of Trump's presumably gold-plated apartment in Trump tower for a slice of pizza and proceeded to use a knife and fork

The American way: Both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama would win approval from New Yorkers with their pizza approach

He told The New York Times he loved having de Blasio in his home borough but could not approve of his genteel pizza-eating.

'No,' he told The New York Times. 'No. It's blasphemy.'

Relenting a little, he added, 'He's from Boston. He doesn't know any better.'

For the record, de Blasio ate three slices of smoked mozzarella and sausage pie.
