One can only imagine what the great man might have thought.

A memorial stone in the shape of a giant iPhone 5 was unveiled today for the late Apple founder Steve Jobs in the Russian city of St. Petersburg.

The interactive monument, which stands over six foot tall, has a screen on the front that shows a slideshow with photographs and videos commemorating key moments in Jobsâ€™ life.

He was first diagnosed with a pancreas neuroendocrine tumour in 2003, and underwent a liver transplant in 2009 - although did not immediately admit to it.

In early 2011 announced that he was taking a third leave of absence from Apple for health reasons.

Ill health finally forced him to resign as Apple's chief executive in August 2011, when he became chairman.

However, it was believed Jobs carried on working for the company he created with Steve Wozniak in his parents garage on April 1st 1976 until his final hours.
