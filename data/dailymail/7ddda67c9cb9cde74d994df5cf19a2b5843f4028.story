Leeds were forced to arrange an unorthodox pre-season friendly between two teams of their own players after their opponents failed to show up.

The Championship side were due to play Viitorul Constanta in Italy at 5pm local time but the Romanian side did not arrive at Mulin De Coi.

Speaking before the game was officially called off, manager Dave Hockaday told the club's website: 'If they don't turn up we will put on a game for the fans because they deserve it.

'We are ready to play tonight's game. We have officials, match kit and we are at the ground.'

After giving their opponents time to show up, Leeds decided to field two teams against each other in order to improve the players' fitness and appease the travelling fans.

After playing three 20-minute thirds, the XI wearing the club's gold away strip won 3-1 courtesy of goals from Steve Morison, Rodolph Austin and Noel Hunt. Matt Smith scored a consolation for the XI sporting United's white home kit.

Leeds won the first match of their Italian tour 16-0 against local amateur side FC Gherdeina on Thursday.
