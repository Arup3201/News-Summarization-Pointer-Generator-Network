Jail-house stripes look like last season’s trend as fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are set to be acquitted of tax fraud, after an Italian prosecutor declared them innocent.

The world famous design duo were sentenced to one year and eight months in jail last year after being convicted of evading taxes on almost one billion euros.

The two founders of the iconic fashion house were also ordered to pay compensation to Italy's tax authorities.

Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce were found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to jail, but may now walk free after a prosecutor said they were innocent

Milan prosecutors had told the court that the creators of the 
world-famous Dolce & Gabbana brand, with six others, evaded taxes 
for several years after setting up a holding company in Luxembourg 
called Gado.

'Gado was an artificial construction with the specific function of obtaining tax benefits,' prosecutors said.

But
 in a dramatic turnaround today an appeal court heard that the
 designers had 'paid their taxes' and that the holding company was 'a 
legal operation'.

The news will come as a relief for fans after the designers said it could go bankrupt if the fine was imposed

At the time of the convictions last year the fashion house closed their Milan store in protest

Prosecutor Gaetano Santamaria Amato today called for the acquittal of all the accused saying 
that 'the case is groundless'.

Mr Santamaria Amato told the court that the financial move outside Italy was 'economically justifiable'.

He
 explained: ‘You chose Luxembourg because the stock exchange is the 
most vibrant in Europe, because its tax system attracts capital and also
 because it has many bilateral treaties with other states that regulate 
the principle of double taxation. ‘

The shock reverse by prosecutors follows a 90 page appeal submitted by the fashion house’s lawyers after the first verdict.

With the prospect of conviction being overturned, life at the high-end fashion house can return to normal (pictured are Scarlet Johansson and Matthew McConaughey in a recent advertising campaign)
