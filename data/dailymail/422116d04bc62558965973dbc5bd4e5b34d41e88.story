Her approach to the big split from Justin Bieber has been sanguine.

And if you're looking for an example of girl power in these simpering times, Selena Gomez is your woman having failed to crumble up and cry at saying goodbye to the teen sensation of a generation.

Instead, she's been focusing on her own career and after taking a detour from the Disney princess route to err on the wild side in Spring Breakers, Selena Gomez returned to her roots to be crowned Favourite Actress at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.

All the women: Katy Perry, Kristen Stewart and Selena Gomez all triumphed at the Kids' Choice Awards 2013, after a turbulent year

The Year of Selena: Ms Gomez was chuffed to be named Favourite Actress 
of the Year at the Kids' Choice Awards despite her show, The Wizards of 
Waverly Place having ended

And she was in good company, as winning big beside her were two modern day celebrity heroines who have also had quite a year of drama.

One, the elegant looking Kristen Stewart, 22, was considered to be a villain after she was rumbled having a fling with her married Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.

But since that nadir last summer, and her reconciliation with Robert Pattinson, the Twilight fans have once again clasped Stewart - who looked lovely in Osman Yousefzada and black Christian Louboutin pumps - to their bosom.

Comeback kid: They said the fans were done with her, they were wrong as Kristen Stewart won Favourite Actress at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards

Independent Woman: Selena has taken her split with Bieber in her stride

'This is crazy': A super-hot looking Katy Perry seemed to be taking her split from John Mayer equally well as she accepted the award for Favourite Singer

Big Time Rush for Katy! Ms Perry was manfully embraced by Carlos Pena Jnr, Logan Henderson and Kendall Schmidt on the stage

And she looked happy and full of fun 
on Saturday when she accepted the award for Favourite Actress, 
vindication indeed that she's still a fan favourite.

'Twilight fans have been the best ever. So thanks guys for honouring me in this way,' said Stewart.

Stewart - who is often accused of 
being pofaced and miserable - even jumped into a sliming with Sandra 
Bullock and Neil Patrick Harris - when she wasn't required to face in 
the indignity, her cute short suit never quite recovered.

The smile that says... it's over: Kristen has left her difficult year behind her

Game for a laugh: Kristen was happy to throw herself in the mix

See, they do still love her: Kristen embraced her fans and the fun atmosphere of the night

No slime free zone: Neil and Sandra thought they were safe until they were covered in green slime

Slime time: Neil threw his head back with laughter as Kristen willingly got covered in goop when she hugged Bullock

Also putting a year of trials and 
tribulations in the romantic department behind her was Katy Perry, 28, 
who has just split from John Mayer after several months.

Last year also saw her divorce her 
British funnyman husband Russell Brand, so it's been a rough old time 
for the Firework singer.

But the young fans seem to love these
 independent women, none of the victims or even prone to airing their 
dirty linen via song lyrics.

'I love the kids,' Katy told the audience after accepting her gong for Favourite Female singer. 'I think it's the coolest award. I love you kids. Stay in school and stay safe.'

Selena, 20, looked 
fittingly betwixt the worlds of childhood and adulthood in an elegant 
but still girlish combination of an aquamarine diaphanous peplum top and
 cream shorts, both by Oscar de la Renta.

She completed the look with Gucci silver sandals and carried a Diane Von Furstenburg bag.

Christina Aguilera and Pitbull opened the show with a crowd-pleasing duet

Hats off Christina: The singer sported an all black outfit consisting of jeans with braces, a low cut top and heels

Performing amongst the slime: Pitbull looked like he was enjoying himself during the performance of Feel This Moment

Pushing the button: Christina Aguilera got Pitbull slimed in spectacular style

Chatting
 after she picked up her award, Selena said this meant the most to her 
as it was voted for by the children and added: 'It's such a good chance 
to let loose.'

She also 
added that she wanted to thank her friends and family, and admitted that
 she was stoked she was recognised now that her Disney show, the Wizards
 of Waverly Place is now off the air.

'I never expected it,' she exclaimed, telling the fans: 'This is for you.'

Kicking some butt: Dwayne Johnson looked thrilled with his gong

Voice of a generation: Adam Sandler thanked the fans and his children after winning the award for Favourite Voice for an Animated Movie

Pitbull and Christina Aguilera kicked off the 26th annual awards and slime fest with their duet Feel This Moment.

And at the end of the performance, 
Aguilera pushed a button, covering Pitbull and the dancers in the show's
 signature green gunge.

 and yellow top as she sang her song C'Mon.

Other winners at the viewer-voted ceremony honouring kids' favourites in film, music, sports and TV included Adam Sandler as favourite voice from an animated movie for Hotel Transylvania, race car driver Danica Patrick as favourite female athlete and The Hunger Games as favourite movie and book.

Johnny Depp made a surprise performance after scooping the Favourite Movie actor gong for his role in Dark Shadows.

'I'm truly honoured and humbled to get this award,' the 49-year-old actor told the audience. 'You're the future.'

Dwayne
 'The Rock' Johnson also got the chance to push the slime button, 
managing to cover Nick Cannon and Josh Duhumel in goop after accepting 
his award for Best Male Buttkicker.

Ready for a dunking: Amanda Seyfried and Jush Hutcherson appeared in a pre-recorded segment where they were seemingly unaware of the drenching to come

Green, mean machine: The cast of animated film Epic received a harsh forest treatment

'From the bottom of my heart. I want to give something back top all of you,' Johnson told the audience before promising slime. 'I've got a very big surprise for everybody.'

Transformers star Josh Duhamel served as host of the slime-filled ceremony at University of Southern California's Galen Center.

One of his first acts as host was dumping goop on Los Angeles Lakers player Dwight Howard.

'I guess that's what we call a slime dunk!' Duhamel said.

Staying dry: Nick Cannon wore a sumo suit and Josh wore a red tracksuit before the obligatory sliming

Green machine: Nick and Josh were drenched in green gunge although their sumo suits kept them fairly dry

Sports gong: NASCAR driver Danica Patrick was delighted to be awarded with the Favourite Female Athlete award

Despite Miami Heat star LeBron James accepting the Favourite Male Athlete award via video link, fan favourite Justin Bieber did not appear to even record a filmed 'thank you' for the Favourite Male Singer award.
