A container holding $600 million worth of loose diamonds was left sitting with a gaping hole on the bottom in the same JFK warehouse where thieves stole $1.2 million in cash last week.

In both instances, the crates arrived on Swiss airlines flights from Zurich.

The latest raid has security experts claiming 'Swiss security has more holes than its cheese'.

Security detail: Crates arriving on Swiss Airlines from Zurich have been the subject of security breaches twice in the space of a week

Up for the taking: On this occasion, $600M worth of diamonds were left open in Swiss airlines cargo container at JFK airport

'Someone could have put their arm inside the cargo container and taken what was inside,' a source said.

A New York Port Authority cop noticed the damaged cargo container on Thursday at around 1:35 pm just an hour after the flight landed.

Although it was still sealed, the container 'had a gap of several inches on the bottom and parcels were visible inside.'

This time there was up to $600 million worth of diamonds that were destined for jewelers in New York.

There's hole in my box: A hole was found in a Swiss cargo container, similar to this one, and the loose diamonds could be seen sitting inside

Flawed security: Last week, $1.2 million in cash was stolen from the same hangar at JFK as this weekends cargo crate hole was discovered

SwissPort International Ltd, the Zurich-based cargo shipper, moved the container to a 'secure unpacking location' where officials compared the inventory inside with a shipping manifest.

Incredibly, nothing was found to be missing.

The company ships 3.5 million tons of cargo yearly on behalf of some 650 client companies and is active at 180 airports in 37 countries, according to the companyâ€™s Web site.

Last weekend, thieves used a forklift to make a hole in the shipping container and were able to steal bundles of cash.

The robbery wasn't reported for a further two days until the crates were opened at a branch of the Federal Reserve in New Jersey.

Presumably, the thieves made off with all they could carry. A further $92 million dollars were left behind.

Police believe the theft was an inside job. The FBI are planning to submit airport workers to polygraph tests to try and determine who carried out the brazen heist.

Big raid: In 1978 a band of masked raiders stormed into the cargo terminal and bagged a reported $3.5 million. The U.S. currency, all used bills for which authorities have no serial numbers, was being shipped to the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York

The largest cash heist in JFK Airport history happened on December 11, 1978, when an estimated $5 million was stolen at the Lufthansa Airlines terminal.

At the time it was also the largest cash theft to have been carried out on US soil and went on to be portrayed in the movie 'Goodfellas'.

It is not unusual for airlines to transport large sums of money - with a single flight sometimes carrying more than $1 billion.
