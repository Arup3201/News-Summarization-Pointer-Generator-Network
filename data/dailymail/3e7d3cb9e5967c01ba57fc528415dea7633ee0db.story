Supermarkets have seen a massive drop in the use of plastic bags when they charge for them, it emerged yesterday.

Since a 5p levy was introduced across Wales last year, Sainsbury’s has reported a 90 per cent reduction in their use there.

Co-op says it has seen a fall of 86 per cent, while Morrisons is down 60 per cent.

A thing of the past? The 5p 'bag tax' appears to be changing shoppers' habits as they ditch disposable bags like these for reusable options

The major supermarkets’ figures suggest the policy has led to a huge reduction in the 350million plastic bags previously used annually in Welsh supermarkets.

It is a major victory for the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, which was launched in 2008 and received enormous support from readers, anti-litter campaigners, the Marine Conservation Society, the National Trust and many other groups.

In Wales, shops are now legally bound to enforce a 5p charge – and then pass on the cash to charities.

Shops that continue to provide free carrier bags face a fine of up to £5,000.

The success of the Welsh initiative is bound to increase pressure on England to ‘banish the bags’ as shoppers switch to bags-for-life to cut down on waste.

From next year shoppers will have to pay 5p for their plastic bags in Northern Ireland, increasing to 10p in 2014, while Scotland is considering a similar plan.

Ministers are understood to be considering adopting a charge throughout England amid evidence that voluntary measures by stores have failed to deliver promised reductions.

Plastic bags are often used only for about 20 minutes, but take up to 1,000 years to rot away, littering the landscape and causing devastation to marine animals and birds, which suffer long painful deaths after ingesting or becoming entangled in them.

ago

After the Daily Mail launched its Banish the Bags campaign four years ago, Marks & Spencer introduced a 5p charge on all food carrier bags, prompting a huge drop in the number handed out to customers.

But last year, large retailers in the UK gave out 6.4billion carrier bags, an increase of 333million in a year.

David Cameron has said the recent increase is unacceptable and has warned retailers that government intervention to reduce numbers is possible.

Last month it emerged that a ban on free plastic bags across the whole of Europe is being considered by Brussels.
