Princess Beatrice made a blunder at the Royal Wedding in an unflattering hat

It could have been fashion's smartest solution.

Summer weddings present all manner of sartorial dilemmas. Is your outfit demure enough for church? Will your dress upstage the bride's? Should you or should you not wear a hat?

And having decided on a hat, how do you pick one that makes you look like Audrey Hepburn at Ascot and not Hyacinth Bucket at the garden fete?

Now, a website has devised a test to determine which sort of hat best suits you.

Fashionworld.co.uk has launched a service called If The Hat Fits - a simple program that 'promises to find you the perfect millinery match'.

After answering a series of questions about face shape, eye colour, hairline and the event in question, If The Hat Fits will offer a solution: be it a pillbox, feather fascinator or something extravagant.

Whether you're putting together a 
wedding outfit or trying to decide on your race day accessories for 
2013, taking your face shape into consideration when choosing a hat can 
help you maintain a look that's as well-balanced as it is stylish. The site allows you to accessorise to suit this, but it needs a few tweaks.

It could have been the ultimate 
problem solver to spare the humiliation of turning up in an 
outlandish hat, in the style of the one Princess Beatrice so memorably wore to the Royal Wedding two years ago (not unlike a loo seat with antlers).

But perhaps if the app had let you upload a picture of yourself and posed real hat solutions you can actually buy - it could have been the perfect style aid.

Your
face shape is determined by the proportion of the different sections of
your face, and there are two easy ways to measure these.

Measure:

1. The middle of your forehead or at the widest point.

2. The top of your cheekbones.

3. Your jaw line at the widest point.

4. The tip of your hairline to the bottom of your chin.

Draw an outline of your face on a mirror:

With a make-up liner, place dots on the top of your hairline,your temples, your jaw line and the bottom of your chinto find your defining points.

Compare your results to the descriptions to see which one of the seven best fits your face shape.

Â 1. Choose face shape

Choosing a round shaped face as this most closely matched measurements

2. Choose eye colour

The next step is choosing eye colour to determine suitable shades (but what about the outfit?)

3. Choose occasion

With four occasions to choose from, we have a wedding coming up and so went for the first option

4: The hat...

This hat fits? I don't own anything green and even if I wanted the head gear - where would I find it? Plus it didn't take into account my long blonde hair. Would I wear it up or down?
