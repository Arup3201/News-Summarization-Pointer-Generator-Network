BBC's swimming expert Steve Parry picks his five to watch out for in the pool at Tollcross...

1. Michael Jamieson (Scotland) - Men's 200m breaststroke, July 24 (heat one) 12.37pm

He's
 the real poster boy up there in Glasgow. He grew up in Scotland and 
trained as a young boy at the Tollcross pool. He won Olympic silver in 
2012 and could turn it into gold in Glasgow. In fact, he's good enough 
to break a world record on the first day.

Formidable: Jamieson will compete on the opening night for Team Scotland in the 200m breaststroke

2. Cameron McEvoy (Australia) - 100m freestyle, July 26 (heat one) 11.42am

James
 Magnussen might be the fastest man in a swimsuit ever but look out for 
his compatriot McEvoy. He’s four inches shorter than Magnusson but is 
fascinated by the physics of swimming — and how he can get through the 
water faster than everyone else. It could be an epic battle between the 
Aussies.

3. Fran Halsall (England) - 50m, 100m freestyle, July 25, 10.56am and July 27, 11.04am

Of course you’ve got to watch out for Fran. She has won seven Commonwealth medals already and has a chance of winning freestyle in Glasgow but she will be going up against fast Australian Cate Campbell.

4. Cameron van der Burgh (South Africa) - 100m breaststroke, July 25, (heat one) 11.15am

This dude is the Olympic champion in the 100m breaststroke and very much a big-match player. He has been there and done it and will be a huge threat again here. But this is the best event in the pool, packed with talent and I’d challenge any sport to provide a bigger depth in quality.

5. George Bovell (Trinidad and Tobago) - 50m freestyle, July 28, (heat one) 10.51am

It’s not often that someone from Trinidad and Tobago has a shout in the pool but in George Bovell they have. He’s getting a bit old — he turned 31 on Friday — but he could take gold in the men’s 50 free. He’s a complete legend.
