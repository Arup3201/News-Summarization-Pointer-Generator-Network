Slayer: Matthew Ondo was arrested Wednesday evening after allegedly chopping off his family dog's head with a machete

A Pittsburgh man is facing animal cruelty charges after he allegedly used a machete to decapitate his mother's chihuahua.

Authorities said they were called to the home Wednesday evening around 6;15pm, and Matthew Ondo's parents showed them the remains of the dog, named Izzy, along with a bloody machete and butcher knife.

Ondo's parents told police their 30-year-old son is an unemployed heroin addict who may have undiagnosed psychological problems.

His mother, Debra Ondo, said she was playing upstairs with the 14-month-old dog when she heard her son call for Izzy.

She didn't realize the dog was killed until her husband came home and began yelling when he discovered what had happened.

The dog's body was discovered by police in the backyard near a picnic table and its head was about six inches away.

According to a criminal complaint, Ondo at first denied killing the dog, then claimed the devil, Allah or 
'the Mexican' did it.

Ondo is being held at the Allegheny County jail, unable to post $25,000 bond. No attorney was listed on court papers.

A preliminary hearing was scheduled for February 26.

Ondo has a criminal record which includes prior convictions for drunk driving, possessing a controlled substance and acting disorderly.
