An ancient spring which laid the foundations for the historic town of Royal Tunbridge Wells has dried up for what is believed to the first time in its 400-year history.

The discovery of the iron-rich waters of the Chalybeate Spring in 1606 prompted the building of the spa town as people flocked in search of its supposed health-giving properties.

But this summer, 408 years after Dudley Lord North drank from the spring and found his hangover cured, the waters have stopped flowing beneath the town's historic Pantiles area.

Run out? The famous Chalybeate Spring in Tunbridge Wells has been closed to visitors after it ran dry

Tourist attraction: The 'dippers' in period dress who serve the water noticed water levels were low in May

Tunbridge Wells began in the 17th century after a nobleman tasted the waters that seeped from the ground

In May, the Tunbridge Wells 'dippers' in period costume who serve up the orange waters to thirst visitors for £1 a time noticed that it was becoming harder to fill their cups.

But this week, town hall bosses had to admit defeat and close the Chaleybeate Spring to tourists as there was no longer any water to serve.

While the water levels flowed slowly in 2011/2012, this is the first time the waters have stopped flowing at all at the spring under the Pantiles.

A spokesman for Tunbridge Wells Borough Council said: 'We don't know what has caused the water to stop.  It can't be right to say the spring itself has dried up, given all the rain we've had, but it has stopped flowing under the Pantiles.

'We have had to close the dipper service as a result, but hopefully it will return soon.'

The Pantiles spring is usually open five days a week from May to September every year.

Targetfollow, the property investment firm that owns the Pantiles, said they were looking into why the water had run dry.

Now the historic spa town's residents are worried about the impact on tourism, which provides 30 per cent of Tunbridge Wells' income.

Resident Richard Loft, 46, said: 'What is a spa town with no spring?'

The spa town, known for its conservative, 'disgusted' residents, was built around the Chalybeate Spring in the early 1600s after the nobleman noticed the orangey-brown waters seeping from the ground and tasted them.

He instantly declared the waters a cure for hangovers, obesity and a 'moist brain', and recommended the area to friends and noblemen in London.

By the time Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I, visited in 1630, it had established itself as a spa retreat, with visitors flocking from London and elsewhere in the country.

The Chalybeate (pronounced Ka Lee Be At) Spring was discovered by Dudley Lord North 408 years ago

By the 1700s, a visit to the spring at Tunbridge Wells had become an essential part of any well-to-do resident or visitor's day.

The town's tourist website reports: 'The day started with a glass of spring water, followed by a promenade on 'The Walks' or a visit to the coffee house for the latest gossip, then off to church at the nearby Chapel of Ease, King Charles the Martyr.

'The afternoon was spent with more promenading, gambling, or a friendly match on one of the nearby bowling greens, and finished with further gambling, dancing or a musical soiree or grand ball in the evening.'

Historians say the Chalybeate water was served by a 'Dipper' for a small charge which covered not the water itself but the service of it being handed to the drinker.

Tunbridge Wells enjoyed huge popularity with the royal family in the 1800s, with visits from the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and in 1909 King Edward VII granted the town its 'Royal' status in honour of this.

In 2010 tourists were banned from drinking the spring water after harmful bacteria were found in it, and the following year the spring was closed temporarily when water levels dropped, but this is the first time that the spring is thought to have dried up completely.
