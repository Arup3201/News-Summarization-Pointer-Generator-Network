Former Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson’s marriage ended in divorce yesterday - three years after his wife’s affair with his police bodyguard.

In a two-minute hearing, their 23-year marriage was brought to an end after his former wife, Laura Jane Patient, petitioned for divorce on the grounds of a two year-separation.

No reasons were given, but Miss Patient, 50, had an affair with her husband’s bodyguard during his time as Home Secretary between June 2009 and May 2010. She was said to be seeking a divorce at the time.

Mr Johnson, the MP for Hull West and Hessle, now 63, left Labour’s front bench and was said to be ‘absolutely devastated’ by the affair.

In a statement released at the time, he said: ‘I have found it difficult to cope with personal issues in my private life while carrying out an important front bench role.’

Mr Johnson’s departure left Labour in turmoil after party leader Ed Miliband had to appoint Ed Balls, his rival for the top job, as shadow chancellor.

Despite this, Mr Johnson defended his ‘poor wife’ who he said was upset by all the attention created by the scandal.

Yesterday, neither would comment on the end of their marriage.

Following the revelation of the affair, Mr Johnson’s police protection officer PC Paul Rice was suspended from duty.

In 2011, he was dismissed from police service following an internal investigation and misconduct hearing.

Mr Johnson married his second wife Laura in August 1991 and they have a 13-year-old son together.

He was previously married to Judith Elizabeth Cox with whom he has three children.

Most recently, Mr Johnson, a former postman and member of a pop group, was in a relationship with Carolyn Burgess, a businesswoman 13 years his junior.

The 50-year-old award-winning businesswoman is the boss of translation agency Language is Everything in Hull where he is an MP.

The father-of-four revealed the relationship in a local newspaper interview with her to celebrate her being made an MBE for services to business and the Humber area.

Miss Burgess, who has been married at least twice, is believed to be separated from her husband, a customer services manager whom she married in 1999.

PC Rice worked for Mr Johnson for more than a year as part of his protection team, guarding his home and travelling with him in Britain and abroad.

He was one of around 230 officers who are part of a unit called SO1, which provides protection for the Prime Minister, cabinet ministers, former ministers judged to need specialist protection and visiting heads of state.

The technical term for the person they are protecting is ‘the principal’.

Former Met Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick was head of specialist operations at Scotland Yard and said at the time: ‘This is really bad news. When you deploy a protection officer, the principal is placing enormous trust not just in the Metropolitan Police Service but in the individual as well.

‘There is an ethical dimension to their training, teaching them not to betray the trust of the principal. The protection officer is in a privileged position and is invited into the private life of the principal.

‘If a protection officer is compromised in any way, emotionally or professionally, the obligation is on the officer to seek removal.’

Yesterday, Miss Patient declined to speak outside her detached £500,000 house in Upper Norwood, south London.

Mr Johnson was not available for comment at his Victorian terrace house in the same area, which is also worth £500,000, but his press spokesman declined to comment.
