An author who wrote her own Fifty Shades of Grey-style novel has accused a council of being 'judgemental prudes' after she lost her job at a children's centre over her erotic fiction.

Bettina Bunte, 51, said her book 'The Lost Soul' was loosely based on her affair with a married middle-aged man when she was a teenager.

She has been promoting the novel in the local press but after complaints from parents about some sexually explicit passages  Kent County Council had her sacked.

Ms Bunte's inspiration for the book came from her 15-year romance  classroom technician when she was 18.

She later fell pregnant with her daughter but when he refused to leave his wife for her their relationship ended.

She wrote under the pseudonym Cass E Ritter and published the book herself - but her detailed of descriptions of sex have caused upset and she was forced from her post at Joy Lane Children's Centre in Whitstable on the Kent coast. 

'I told the council they were judgemental prudes,' she said.

'I doubt the people who decided to sack me have read Fifty Shades of Grey, let alone my book.

The Lost Soul is described as 'a journey to remember' for main character Nina who discovers 'lasting friendship, forbidden love and sizzling passion' with 'a man who cannot be hers'

'They obviously just see it as pornography, but it is not - it is just explicit sexual descriptions of what adults think about and do every day.

'The council told be that it could not be seen to be promoting "this sort of thing" and that was the end of it - I'd lost my job.'

It is being sold on Amazon in its erotica section.

Ms Bunte had recently been offered a permanent position to join the centre after four years working for an agency and said she was shocked at losing her job.

She said: 'They called me during work in the morning to attend a meeting in the afternoon.

'I asked what it was about but all they said was it is something about the book.

'We discussed it at the meeting where they asked me a number of questions. I was told KCC cannot be seen to promote this sort of thing.

'They felt it was a problem as it had damaged the reputation by making the link between the book and children's centre.

'I had applied and was offered a permanent position which was then withdrawn and my employment was terminated.

'I was shocked, extremely shocked. I tried not to say anything rude. I felt their reaction was out of proportion and judgmental.'

Kent County Council said they took action after concerns were raised by staff and parents after the novel's release.

On the attack: Ms Bunte, who is writing a sequel, says that Kent County Council are 'judgemental prudes'

A spokeswoman said: 'Ms Bunte was employed through an agency to work at one of our children's centres.

'Following the publicity around her self-published novel and the issues discussed in the article, concerns were raised by staff and parents.

'Managers met with Ms Bunte to discuss these issues and, following this meeting, continued to have concerns about her suitability to continue working at the centre.

'It was felt that the most appropriate action was to stop her employment as agency cover. She will no longer be working for us.'

German-born Bettina said she took legal advice in the hope of challenging her dismissal but is unable to as she works for an agency as opposed to a company.

She added: 'They did what they did because they can. I was working in a very good team with a supportive manager but I have no comeback against them.'

Bettina, who grew up in Munich before moving to a school in Kent, said the illicit romance helped her through her troubled teens when she was estranged from her family.

She said: 'I was a loner at school. He took the trouble to be kind and we became friends. It was a safe place for me to go with no fighting or strife.

'This friendship helped me to build my own new life without my family - a life where I was worth something and didn't feel constantly criticised.'
