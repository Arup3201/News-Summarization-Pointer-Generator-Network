The producer/writer told the New York Post that he is devastated his mom didn’t live long enough to be at his nuptials.

‘We're together awhile but... everybody's dying. Even our dog died. Look, mom was getting up there. Our November wedding was close - and she died.

‘She wasn't even sick. I'd spoken to her just before. My sister's coming from L.A. My brother's arriving from Denmark.'
