Pot-smoking country singer Willie Nelson has been accused of stealing a marijuana-inspired song and passing it off as his own.

Songwriter Ashley Wilson claims she and her late partner 'Uncle' Mark Reynolds wrote Nelson's Number One hit 'Roll Me Up And Smoke Me When I Die' a quarter of a century ago.

And now they want Nelson to give up all his profits from the song, which topped the charts for the 81-year-old country outlaw in 2012, when he sang it along with other famous marijuana users Snoop Dogg, Kris Kristofferson and country star Jamey Johnson.

Wilson, 45, has filed a federal lawsuit in her native Georgia, claiming copyright infringement against Nelson, four men listed as the hit's songwriters and a slew of record companies.

Songwriter Ashley Wilson claims she and her late partner 'Uncle' Mark Reynolds wrote Nelson's Number One hit a quarter of a century ago.

The suit points to versions of the song posted on YouTube. In one,  Reynolds, who died in 2004 aged 44, says he wrote the song for his mother.

'She called and asked me one day, your father and I are filling out some paperwork and she said there's a clause in there, "if you die before we do." So I went and thought about this thing and I dealt with it the only way I could and that was in a song."

Wilson, who lives in Woodstock, Georgia, claims she and Reynolds, who sang as a duet called Ashley and Mark, recorded the song on an album released on cassette in 1990. She did not return calls from Daily Mail Online.

In the suit, Wilson says Reynolds 'likely' knew John Colgin, one of the four songwriters named in the suit, and listed as having written Nelson's version. She says Colgin lived at the time in Roswell, Georgia, just 14 miles from Reynolds' home in Woodstock.

Though the lyrics of the two versions are different, Wilson said they 'contain the same title and dominant line in the chorus…with substantially similar melody, rhythm and cadence, as well as substantially similar lyrical themes.'

Nelson's version includes the lines 'Now you won't see no sad and teary eyes when I get my wings and it's my time to fly. Call my friends and tell 'em there's a party, come on by. Now just roll me up and smoke me when I die.

The Reynolds/Wilson version lyrics say: 'Now don't you sit around a-weeping, telling tales about how good I was. Just gather round and have some drinks and party out loud and remember that's the way it was. Now roll me up and smoke me when I die.'

Nelson recorded his version for his 2012 album 'Heroes.' He released the single on April 20 2012 — a significant day for pot smokers as 420 is slang for cannabis. He sang it at 4.20 p.m. on that day at the unveiling of an 8 ft. statue of himself in Austin, Texas.

'Fellow singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson congratulated Nelson, who thanked the Texas city as marijuana smoke wafted through the crowd,' Associated Press reported at the time.

Later the same year Nelson issued a memoir called Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.
