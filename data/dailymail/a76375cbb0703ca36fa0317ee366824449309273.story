These amazing photographs bring a whole new meaning to coming face to face with danger.

But Ana the Sumatran Tiger is actually a big pussycat, say her keepers, as long as you feed her right and give her lots of love and attention.

That is advice photographer Syahrul Ramadan may have wished he took when he visited Ragunan Zoo, in Jakarta, Indonesia, to take the snaps.

Really angry: Ana the Sumatran Tiger lets out a ferocious roar, flashing her huge canines and razor-sharp incisors whilst folding back her ears - a sign she was extremely angry

Ana left Mr Ramadan, 36, in no doubt of her feelings when she unleashed a ferocious roar directly in his face.

She flashed her huge canines and razor-sharp incisors whilst folding back her ears - a sign she was extremely angry.

Mr Ramadan captured the two roars in quick succession at the Zoo, before hotfooting out of her pen to avoid becoming lunch.

Sumatran tigers, as their name 
suggests, are only found on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, where they
continue to be poached for traditional medicine.

They are the smallest of all tigers 
alive today. Their stripes are narrower and closer together than on many
other sub-species, which make them highly adapted to moving stealthily 
through dense forest.

Natural poser: But despite her anger, Ana came round in the end and couldn't resist striking a majestic side on pose during the shoot
