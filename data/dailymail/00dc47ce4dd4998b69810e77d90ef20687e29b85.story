A young mother died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after being sent home by her GP with antibiotics to treat earache, an inquest has heard.

Tragic Zoe Adams, 28, died last year after medics put her symptoms - including ear and head pain, and discharge from her left ear - down to a ‘relatively minor’ infection.

But a coroner concluded that doctors couldn’t have done any more to save the ‘extremely unlucky’ mother-of-three, who collapsed and died in Wythenshawe Hospital on March 21 last year.

Tragic mum Zoe Adams, 28, who died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after her GP treated her for an ear infection.

Doctors believe the infection spread from Zoe Adams' ear to her brain despite being treated by a course of antibiotics

The mother-of-three was seen by two further doctors who all agreed with the ear infection diagnosis because Zoe Adams did not show any symptoms alerting them to the killer brain bug

A top ear, nose and throat surgeon, Andrew Camilleri, who carried out an investigation for the hospital into Ms Adams' death, told the inquest that there was around a one-in-4,000 chance of an ear infection leading to a brain abscess.

He said he was satisfied the hospital 
had taken all the steps possible to treat Miss Adams and said by looking
 at her, no-one would have suspected she had a brain abscess.

The court heard from medics - two doctors who had seen Ms Adams in the weeks before her death and two nurses who had taken calls from her - who said Ms Adams’ symptoms were consistent with nothing more than an ear infection.

A brain abscess is a rare and life-threatening condition caused when an infection travels from another part of the body to the brain.

Only three people per million will contract the deadly bug each year.

With early diagnosis, nine out of ten patients are expected to survive.

Patients suffering a brain abscess often develop a headache which is so severe it is not helped by pain killers.

The infection can often cause changes in a patient's mental state and brings a fever with temperatures in excess of 38c

A patient may also suffer seizures as the infection attacks the brain. 

A brain abscess can be caused by sinusitis and even a dental infection that attacks the brain.

In
 some cases, a brain abscess can be caused by a serious head injury 
leading to a fractured skull allowing the infection to pass into the 
brain tissue.

Patients diagnosed with a brain abscess will be treated with anti-biotics, surgery and in some cases anti-fungals.

The earlier a patient is treated, the less chance of long-term complications.

In fact, the mother-of-three had developed a middle ear infection which had led to a large 4cm abscess developing on the left side of her brain.

The hearing was told the tragedy began on February 12 last year after Miss Adams, from Rusholme, Manchester went to see her GP Dr Praful Patel complaining of pains in her ear.

The doctor examined her ear including the bone structure but thought the symptoms pointed to an outer ear infection.

He prescribed her with antibiotics and asked her to come back in three weeks if she did not get any better.

On March 1 Miss Adams called a triage nurse working for the Out-of-Hours Go To Doc service saying her ear was 'very painful' and was 'nine out of ten' on the pain scale.

She was referred to a doctor at an out-of-hours surgery based at Wythenshawe Hospital who thought it was an infection of the middle ear but prescribed antibiotics and advised her to come back in a few days if the pain persisted or became worse.

On March 16, Miss Adams spoke to another out-of-hours nurse complaining of headache and earache and four days later she was admitted to hospital.

The Manchester hearing was told after her admission, she did not display signs of illness, such as high temperature or changed mental state, that could have prompted doctors to send her for a brain scan that might have discovered the abscess.

Although she was seen to be very distant the night before she died, that was put down to the pressures of coping with young children.

She last seen alive going to the toilet at around 4am after being kept in hospital overnight. She died on the ward later that day.

Coroner Nigel Meadows said Zoe Adams was 'incredibly unlucky' saying the lack of other symptoms gave doctors little chance of diagnosing a brain abscess because of her 'robust constitution'

Recording a verdict of death by 
natural causes, Coroner Nigel Meadows said the diagnosis of a 
"relatively minor" ear infection by Dr Patel had been 'completely 
appropriate'.

Mr Meadows 
said the out-of-hours service had taken a sensibly cautious approach to 
Miss Adams' condition and he thought they could not have done anymore to
 prevent her death.

Mr 
Meadows said Miss Adams did not display any normal signs of somebody 
with a cerebral abscess and added: 'Zoe has just been extremely unlucky 
to contract this infection and to have a robust constitution.'He
 added: 'There was no evidence that her condition justified a CT scan. 
It would be unrealistic to expect that the hospital perform a CT scan on
 everybody who has a ear infection.

'Even
 if she was given a emergency CT scan the night she died then there is 
also no evidence to suggest she would have been able to be saved.

'It
 is a very unfortunate series of events. The vast majority of people who
 have ear infections don't have a cerebral abscess. She has been 
extremely unlucky to contract this infection.'He added: 'Zoe
 has just been extremely unlucky to contract this infection and to have a
 robust constitution [that meant doctors could not tell she had an 
abscess].'

Speaking
 afterwards, Ms Adams’ mum, Michelle Holt, said she accepted the 
verdict, adding: 'It’s been a very, very hard time. My daughter was like
 me and had a very strong pain threshold.'

Brain abcesses are incredibly rare in Britain with most neurosurgeons expecting to treat at most four patients a year.
