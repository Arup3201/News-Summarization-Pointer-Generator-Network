A new mother has shed nearly half her bodyweight after her size caused complications during  childbirth and threatened her daughter's life.

Despite only being 5ft tall, Leila Mounji hit 15st during her pregnancy so when doctors went to administer painkillers, they couldn't get the needle into the epidural space around her spine.

Medics feared giving her a high-risk general anaesthetic because of her BMI, but felt they had no choice and performed an emergency Caesarean during the ordeal in July 2012.

'I put Bella through hell during birth. I thought she was going to die, it was horrific,' Leila said

Despite only being 5ft tall, Leila Mounji hit 15st during her pregnancy, left, so when doctors went to administer painkillers, they couldn't get the needle into the epidural space around her spine. Now, right, she has shed 7st thanks to a healthy new lifestyle and says she feels like a new woman

Because of the circumstances, baby Bella suffered breathing problems, which subsequently starved her of oxygen.

As a result of the incident, Leila, 29, decided to improve her wellbeing and has since shed 7st.

Leila, from Derby, said: 'I put Bella through hell during birth. I thought she was going to die, it was horrific.

'They said she was one of the sickest babies they had seen and was expected to die because her heart and kidneys had shut down.

Leila, pictured at her heaviest, explains that if somebody, like her, has a high Body Mass Index this can make it harder to find the correct place to put the anaesthetic needle in and how quickly it takes effect

According to NHS Choices, babies born to women with a BMI over 30 are more likely to have problems such as: 

The woman is also more likely to need:

Extra problems for the pregnant woman include:

'She was my first child and I thought it had gone horribly wrong. It was the most tragic experience of my life seeing her shut down.

'I was ashamed and embarrassed because I knew this was all down to me and how big I was.'

Experts say if somebody has a high Body Mass Index this can make it harder to find the correct place to put the anaesthetic needle in and affects how quickly it takes effect.

A high BMI may also cause problems with general anaesthesia during and after a Caesarean, which is what happened with Bella.

Leila was giving birth at the Royal Derby Hospital but because of complications, she was rushed to Sheffield.

Bella spent two weeks at Sheffield on life support before returning to the Royal Derby Hospital where her condition started to improve.

Leila said her pregnancy had been difficult leading up to the point of birth, and blames her size. 

Leila said: 'I was morbidly obese and from my first doctor's appointment they said my size would create problems because of the pressure it would put her under. 

She would resort to wearing baggy jumpers and trousers around the pool to hide her figure

Breakfast: Nothing

Snacks: Anything that was high in fat/sugar, fizzy drinks

Lunch: McDonald's or fish and chips

Tea: Chicken nuggets and chips or lasagne 

Breakfast: Porridge

Lunch: Jacket potato with beans and salad or eggs on toast

Tea: Slimming world chicken curry or a homemade stir fry

'It was an awful pregnancy and I suffered a lot. After the birth, Bella became so distressed that she had to be put on a life-support machine for a week.

'The hell we went through was a wake-up call to realise I needed to change. It was heartbreaking to think I had caused her so many problems.'

Before her pregnancy, Leila admits that she had always been big and was often the victim of strangers' taunts. 

Leila said she was 'so ashamed she had to act', left, and at 8st, right, she feels like a 'completely new woman'

On one girls' holiday to Benidorm, she resorted to wearing baggy jumpers and trousers around the pool but still heard nasty comments about her size.

After the ordeal, Leila signed up to Slimming World and, at 8st, feels like a new woman.

She said: 'I was so ashamed and embarrassed I had to act.

'I never thought I was that big, and my height was a reason for that. But actually I was out of control and I can't believe how big I was but now I feel like a different woman.'
