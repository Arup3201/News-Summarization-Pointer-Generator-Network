Plans are at an advanced stage for a League of Nations football competition within Europe to spice up the much-maligned friendly dates in the international calendar.

The UEFA initiative, which is expected to win support from the 54 national associations, will be further developed at the annual Congress in Kazakhstan next month, with a start date scheduled for 2018 after the World Cup in Russia.

The latest developments come as the FA recognise a need for quality friendlies to fill Wembley in the wake of such an uninspiring Euro 2016 fixture list that practically guarantees qualification.

New ideas: UEFA president Michel Platini is supporting a new European League of Nations tournament

Challenge: England would face European countries in a league format before progressing to a knockout competition under the plans

Big draw: Facing some of Europe's top countries could help the FA avoid empty seats at Wembley, like there were against Moldova last year

The proposed League of Nations format, to be played over a two-year period with semi-finals and final in a year without a major championship, would see the 54 countries split into various leagues offering promotion, relegation and wild card places at Euro 2020.

England would expect to be in the top division of 12 countries, split into four groups of three to provide a last-four for the knockout stages.

On top of that set of matches, the FA would still have occasional friendly dates on which to play showcase opponents, such as the Republic of Ireland or Brazil.

Option: The FA will still be able to host top tier friendlies, like the one played against the Republic of Ireland in May 2013

A significant number of the Lord’s Taverners 5,000-strong membership will not be impressed by the famous cricket charity honouring Graeme Swann at a big Lord’s function in April given the controversial way he quit international cricket in the middle of the disastrous Ashes tour.

Honoured: Former England star Graeme Swann will be the centre of attention at a Lord's Taverners function in April, despite retiring from international cricket during the recent Ashes series

However Taverners chief executive Paul 
Robin said: ‘I know there are members who are disappointed at the way 
Swann retired, but we are celebrating his great career.’

England manager Roy Hodgson was talking on Sky Sports on Monday night about the possibility of taking a psychologist to Brazil to help with the mental side of penalty shoot-outs.

Alongside him, Glenn Hoddle expressed his belief that the pressure on penalty takers on the long walk from the halfway line to the spot is all in the head.

Yet Sky presenter David Jones missed an open goal by not asking former England boss Hoddle about the astonishing revelation in his France 98 book that his one big mistake was not having wacky faith-healer Eileen Drewery with the England team.

The London Legacy Development Corporation are ‘very confident’ of securing title sponsors for the Olympic Stadium by the end of the year.

With the help of IMG, they are concentrating on finding backing for their flagship venue with the potential selling point of various rights for the other facilities being bundled into an Olympic Stadium deal.

However, the stadium, now bereft of its landmark triangular floodlights, looks a sorry sight compared to the stunning Aquatics Centre, which has been restored to its original Zaha Hadid design without the spectator wings.

GB stars hog limelight

Breakfast TV cameras crews who had been booked to film the public opening of the Aquatics Centre were diverted at the last moment for a media opportunity with Britain’s Sochi medallists - much to the chagrin of the London Legacy Development Corporation.

A BOA spokesman said: ‘We were just responding to the interest.’

Meanwhile diver Tom Daley just happened to be doing a training exercise on steps close to where photographers were gathered.

But pool staff insist it wasn’t staged and say Tom is in training most days at the Aquatics Centre, which opens to the public from Saturday.

Architect Zaha Hadid, who somehow likes the eyesore that is Boris Johnson’s vanity Orbit structure next to her work of art, has two big sports stadium designs on the go - in Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics and a Qatar 2022 venue.

About the scandalous death toll among Qatar’s immigrant construction workforce, Hadid said: ‘I have nothing to do with the workers. It’s an issue for the government. I’m more concerned about the deaths in Iraq.’
