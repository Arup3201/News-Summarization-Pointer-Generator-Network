These are the satellite images being used by the UN to claim that facilities at two Iranian cities may be used to develop nuclear weapons.

Satellite images of Arak and Natanz show changes to the facilities in the areas when compared with images taken in October 2010.

The overhead pictures were released by Google following a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which expressed 'serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme'.

2010: A satellite image shows the facility in Natanz, Iran, described as the country's 'biggest nuclear facility'

A year on: Sections of road appear to have have been developed or removed and other landscape changes are noticeable in the satellite image taken last month

The IAEA report released earlier this week states that while some activities in Iran have civilian as well as military applications, others are 'specific to nuclear weapons'.

There were indications in the dossier that the country had conducted detonator development, as well as high explosives testing and electronic modelling of a nuclear warhead core.

The IAEA report, which ‘completely discredits’ the Islamic nation’s protestations of innocence, according to Foreign Secretary William Hague, cites preparatory work for a nuclear weapons test.

Development of an intermediate-range nuclear payload capable of reaching Israel is also in progress, according to the report.

A year on: Buildings and plant at the top left and bottom left appear to have been removed in this year's image of Arak, while there has been new building in the centre of the plant

Natanz, which features a Fuel Enrichment Plant and Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at its site, has been described as 'the facility at the heart of Iran's dispute with the UN'.

In its latest report on Iran, the UN 
International Atomic Energy Agency outlines the sum of its knowledge on 
the Islamic republic's alleged secret nuclear weapons work, including:

It is also thought to be the largest nuclear facility in Iran, and has anti-aircraft weapons to defend itself from potential airstrikes.

The town of Arak is home to a heavy-water production plant, which can be used to generate nuclear power.

The IAEA report stated that the agency requested further access to the plant in August, but did not receive a response from Iran.

Instead it has chosen to monitor the facilities from the air via satellite imagery.

It was revealed earlier this week 
that Israel could launch military action against Iran before Christmas, 
in a bid to prevent the country from developing a nuclear weapon.

Sources
 say the understanding at the top of the British Government is that 
Israel will attempt to strike against the nuclear sites ‘sooner rather 
than later’ – with logistical support from the U.S.

A senior Foreign Office figure has 
revealed that ministers have been told to expect Israeli military 
action, adding: ‘We’re expecting something as early as Christmas, or 
very early in the new year.’

Officials
 believe President Barack Obama would have to support the Israelis or 
risk losing vital Jewish-American support in the next presidential 
election.

In recent 
weeks, Ministry of Defence sources confirmed that contingency plans have
 been drawn up in the event that the UK decided to support military 
action.

Iran is also pursuing its nuclear weapons programme at the Parchin military base about 30 kilometres from Tehran, diplomatic sources in Vienna say
