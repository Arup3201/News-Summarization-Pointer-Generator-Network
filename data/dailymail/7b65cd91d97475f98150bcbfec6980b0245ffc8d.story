Tottenham are considering a move for Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar and could use midfielder Lewis Holtby as a makeweight.

The Dutch centre-back is in demand after helping his country reach the World Cup semi-finals in Brazil earlier this month.

Tottenham are also prepared to offer Michael Dawson in a player-plus-cash deal but he is reluctant to leave London.

Enhanced reputation: Ron Vlaar is wanted by Tottenham after impressing at the World Cup

Disposable: Michael Dawson and Lewis Holtby could be offered to Aston Villa in exchange for Vlaar

Slight adjustments: Mauricio Pochettino wants to bring in some new faces to Tottenham

Southampton are also keen on Vlaar as they bid to replace Liverpool-bound Dejan Lovren.

Tottenham made their first two forays into the transfer market under Mauricio Pochettino on Wednesday evening as they completed the signings of Swansea duo Ben Davies and Michel Vorm.

And the former Southampton manager is now keen to step up his attempts to bring new faces while moving on players who he does not plan to use regularly.

Interested: Southampton manager Ronald Koeman could rival Tottenham's pursuit of Vlaar
