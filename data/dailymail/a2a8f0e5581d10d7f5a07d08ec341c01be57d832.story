Queens Park Rangers move for Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson has been delayed over the player's personal terms.

As revealed by Sportsmail earlier this month, QPR have agreed a £4.8million transfer fee with the Dutch giants for the Iceland international.

But Sigthorsson's move is still to be concluded, with the delay understood to be over the forward's wage package.

Rangers have found difficulty in agreeing a pay-deal with Sigthorsson's representatives, but club officials are still working on a solution.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who was due to meet with members of the Loftus Road hierarchy over the club's plans for the remainder of the transfer window yesterday, wants the deal concluded as soon as possible.

On Sigthorsson's protracted switch to west London, Ajax sporting director Marc Overmars said: 'I have had some good talks with QPR over Kolbeinn. 

'We are pretty close to each other regarding the transfer fee, but the player's demands are obviously important as well.

'I think QPR is a good opportunity for Kolbeinn. Just look at how Wilfried Bony fares in the Premier League. He has already caught the attention of some major clubs after just one year in England.'
