Denial: Andrew Hamade, brother of Bryan 26 (pictured), has denied accusations that his brother leaked nude celebrity pictures online

The brother of a software engineer alleged to have been behind leaked photos of nude celebrities has spoken for the first time.

Bryan Hamade, 26, was accused of being the mystery hacker who took intimate photos from celebrities' iCloud accounts after trying to sell pictures of Jennifer Lawrence online.

Now Bryan's brother, Andrew, has called the accusations 'a massive misunderstanding' saying that his family are now being harassed.

Speaking to Buzzfeed about his brother, Andrew said: 'He’s good, he’s a little mind-blown about the whole thing.

'It’s a crazy situation and he’s a little shocked that this is really even happening.

'Right now my brother won’t turn on his phone because so many people are finding his number. If he turns it on it’s just like a massacre.'

Andrew added that his mother feels unable to leave the house because of people gathered at the end of her driveway, and that his 15-year-old half-brother had also been contacted.

Mr Hamade 
was 'outed' after posting images of Jennifer Lawrence on Reddit under 
the username BluntMastermind and allegedly trying to sell them for $100 
each.

However users on 4chan, the site where the images were originally leaked, recognised the names of drives on his computer and used that information to reveal his identity.

Admitting
 he had been an ‘idiot’, he insisted he had lied about being the 
original hacker and said the photo he had tried to sell was a fake.

He
 told the MailOnline: ‘I am not behind this. I lied to someone on Reddit
 to try and get bitcoins with a photoshopped picture. '

His brother Andrew also denied rumours that Bryan had been contacted by the FBI, saying that the family was speaking with an attorney but were not aware of any legal issues so far.

Andrew also said that, after speaking with a lawyer, his brother would be issuing a statement about the leaks today, but was unable to say when.

Speaking about Southern Digital Media, the company Mr Hamade was reported to work for, he said it was a family experiment by his mother to try out web hosting.

He added that most of the 'employees' listed on the site are actually family members.

According
 to a chart doing the rounds online, Hamade gave himself away as one of the original 
leakers when he attempted to prove to a 4chan user he had genuine nude 
images for sale.

He posted a shot of his computer screen which revealed the names of his hard drive and network drive. Reddit users then tracked back through Hamade's previous posts and matched the hard drive and the PC name.

They then used this information to track down the Southern Digital Media website, which listed Bryan's name and occupation.

Bryan said: ‘4chan thinks it's me for because of the photoshopped post I made. I am not a hacker. I have no idea how the hell someone could hack into all those accounts.’

Mr Hamade said he had been caught up in an internet ‘witch hunt’ to find the culprit.

He added: 'I am just an idiot 
who tried to pull one over on 4chan and lost big time.

'I am not the 
original leaker. I only reposted one thing that was posted elsewhere and
 stupidly had my network folders visible.

The original photos were reportedly stolen via iCloud, before being published on file-sharing website 4chan

'I'd never in a million years know how to hack into any of the accounts listed. 4chan just attacked me because they like to attack anyone in situations such as this.’

Hamade added that in an attempt to prove his innocence, he is now hunting for the real hacker.

'The real guy is on 4chan posting intermittently,' Hamade said.

'He’s most likely the one behind it, but it does seem the photos passed around to multiple people before being leaked, so it may just be someone who has them and didn’t hack to get them.'

Jennifer Lawrence is just one of around 100 celebrities named on a list by a hacker who claims to have accessed their accounts.

Others on the list include Kate Upton, Cat Deeley, Ariana Grande and Victoria Justice.
