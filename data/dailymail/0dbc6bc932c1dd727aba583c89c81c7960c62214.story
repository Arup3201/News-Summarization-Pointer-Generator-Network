A 113-year-old woman has married her 70-year-old toyboy six months after the pair fell in love at a nursing home in China.

Bride Azatihan Sawuti finally tied the knot with groom Aimti Ahemti, after initially rejecting his first proposal, during a ceremony at Bachu County in the western Xinjiang province.

The loving couple began their romance last year, and Aimti admitted one of the ways she wooed him was by handing over extra food.

A number of residents from the care home attended the low-key wedding last week. The bride wore a veil and the groom a hat as they sat at a table to share their vows.

After the wedding, Aimti said: 'We are very happy together. I don't care she is much older than me.

'She takes good care of me, and gives me her portion of meat during meals.' 

They met in December 2013 and have been inseparable ever since.

Aimti said his first proposal was refused by Azatihan, who felt ashamed to get married at such an old age.

'I started to chase her, like a young man'. Eventually, this April Azatihan accepted his proposal,' he added.

Last year a 127-year-old Chinese woman was named the oldest in the world.

According to a survey, the perfect age gap for partners is four years and four months - but only when the man is older.
