Police are investigating  a 'kidnap' sticker plastered on the back of a pick-up truck that creates the illusion a young woman is bound and gagged in the back.

Pictures of the vehicle and its controversial bumper sticker were taken in Leeds and is being spread across the internet  using the hashtag #rapetruck.

Detectives from West Yorkshire Police say they have spoken to the owner, believed to be fitness trainer James Hellewell, and the force say he has agreed to remove it.

Mr Hellewell was warned that driving around with his sticker could be classed as a public order offence.

He appears to have initially agreed to take it off but may now have refused.

Tweeting about police demanding he take it off he wrote: 'NO' hours after saying it had been 'fun' having the sticker but he would remove the 'wrap'. 

Leonie Smith tweeted West Yorkshire Police and the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire, about the sticker.

Since then she says trolls have been sending her threatening messages.

She said: 'I was just absolutely disgusted and outraged. I thought it was too serious not to say something.

“Rape is a serious problem and domestic violence is not a joke, so to drive around with a woman bound and gagged is not acceptable.”

She added: “Some people are arguing that it is freedom of speech to have that on your car.

“It’s in my city and I am not OK with this kind of culture being tolerated in Leeds. 

'Even if you disagree with the image, it is not right to threaten people.'

Confession: James Hellewell tweeted about the visit by police who asked him to remove his sticker - it is not clear if he has agreed

Previous: A Texan company has sold similar stickers in the past - although they scrapped them

West Yorkshire Police have met with Mr Hellewell and asked it to be removed.  

Chief inspector Steve Palmer, Leeds city centre commander, said: 'It was clear that a number of people had found the image offensive and had been alarmed and distressed by it being displayed in public.

'The registered keeper of the vehicle was traced and spoken to by officers and made aware of the concerns raised and the potential for the continued display of the image to be treated as a public order offence.'

He added: 'They have agreed to have the image removed from the vehicle.' 

MailOnline has attempted to contact James Hellewell, who is yet to respond. 

A Texan company printed similar stickers but stopped after the product was widely criticised.
