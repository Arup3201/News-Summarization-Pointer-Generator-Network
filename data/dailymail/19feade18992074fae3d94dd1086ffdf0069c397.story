It was supposed to be a touching gesture from a loving father to his children.

But having their initials tattooed on his arm appears to have backfired for Dragon’s Den star Duncan Bannatyne after Twitter followers ridiculed his new body art. 

The multi-millionaire tycoon got inked for the first time at 65 years of age during a holiday in Sydney, Australia, with his family. 

The businessman had 'AHJEET' - the initials of his six children Abigail, Hollie, Jennifer, Eve, Emily and Tom - put on his left arm in bold black letters.

One of his 700,000 Twitter followers was  less than impressed with his new artwork, asking; 'Is it supposed to say Eejit?'

One Twitter user asked the multi-millionaire, ''Is it supposed to say Eejit?'

One Twitter user using the name Ken Barlow asked Bannatyne: 'Is it supposed to say Eejit?'

Another posted: 'Looks more like you have had your arm franked ready to be posted... Not the best if it is for real.'

The Clydebank-born businessman uses 'AHJEET' as a pet name for them and has previously had a company called Ahjeet Limited.

Bannatyne told his  followers on the social networking site: 'Age 65 I got my first tattoo in Sydney.

The multi-millionaire tycoon told his Twitter followers that he was 'enjoying Australia so much I might stay here'

'It's the initials of my children in order of age.

'Enjoying Australia so much I might stay here.' 

Earlier this month Bannatyne told his Twitter followers that he was 'starting to fall in love with Ukip'.

However, one of them replied: 'I think your account has been hacked... you can't be serious?'

Bannatyne has a total wealth of £175mm according to the Sunday Times and was placed at 534 on the annual Rich List.

Last year, BBC broadcaster David Dimbleby shocked the nation by revealing that he had got his first tattoo - at the age of 75.

The Question Time presenter told how he had a 'modest' image of a scorpion tattooed on his right shoulder. Referring to singer Cheryl Cole's tattoo on her bottom, he said that he 'wasn't tempted to have any private parts decorated'.

Dimbleby said: 'You are only old once. I have always wanted a tattoo. I thought I might as well have it done now.'
