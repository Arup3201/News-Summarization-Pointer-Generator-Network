They are better known for sitting on the X Factor panel and judging hopeful popstars on their vocal abilities.

But now, the judges themselves have been given the chance to show off their own talent, and both Gary Barlow and Tulisa have proven that there is more artistic flair to them than simply belting out a few high notes.

Both singers have sketched cute Christmas card designs which feature in a bespoke pack of six alongside designs from The Saturdays, Emmerdale's Matthew Wolfenden, and Daybreak's Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones.

Gary Barlow's card features a magical flying Santa and accompanying message opening up about his favourite Christmas memories

Tulisa shows off her artistic and domestic talents with her festive card featuring Christmas lunch

Hallmark, the card and gift 
specialists, has joined forces with ITV1’s Daybreak to produce its 
official ‘Text Santa’ charity Christmas cards with the celebrities.

Each card comes complete with a special joyeaux message from 
each of the celebrities themselves.

The
message from Gary Barlow, featured with his magical flying Santa Christmas card design, 
reads: 'When I was a little boy, I remember looking out of my window on a
snowy Christmas Eve and seeing Santa riding his sleigh!

'It was the best
Christmas present ever to see Santa, so my card is all about the magic 
and bubbling excitement of Santa and Christmas Eve! Ho Ho Ho Merry 
Christmas!'

The Saturdays combined their creative talents and sketched a Saturday night Santa

The Saturdays’ opted for a groovy break dancing ‘Saturday night Santa’ while Tulisa’s feasting Santa tucking into a Christmas banquet proved that the 24-year-old has more than a few talents up her sleeve.

Emmerdale’s Matthew Wolfenden sketched ‘Santadale’, with Santa and his sheep-come reindeer lost in the Yorkshire Dales and Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones’ presenter Santa and snowman sidekick is reminiscent of their TV roles.

Speaking about the card collection Lorraine and Aled said: 'Christmas 
brings back all those memories of being cosy at home and getting 
everyone together for a good old celebration!

'This year whilst we are at 
home with our friends and families we are leaving the presenting on the 
Daybreak sofa to these two special guests!

Have a magical Christmas and a
wonderful New Year! Love from Lorraine and Aled xx'

The celebrities all put pen to paper to show off their art skills together with 
competition winner, six-year-old Demi Holmes who won a nationwide ‘Sketch Santa’ competition (set up by ITV1 
Daybreak and Hallmark) by creating a card that captured exactly what 
Christmas meant to her.

Now,
Demi’s winning card will be sold alongside the five celeb-designed 
creations to create a charity card six-pack.

The pack is available today
in Hallmark stores, at www.hallmark.co.uk and from the 27th in Asda 
stores. They will cost from £1.99 with at least 50p going to the ‘Text 
Santa’ appeal, which in turn supports six worthy charities.
