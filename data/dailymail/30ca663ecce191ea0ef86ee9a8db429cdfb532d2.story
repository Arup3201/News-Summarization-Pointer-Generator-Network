A Swedish politician who posted a video by a former Ku Klux Klan leader on her Facebook page has defended her actions, saying she is not racist.

Dayana Jadarian posted the video to her social media account, along with the message: 'What he says is facts (sic) and everyone knows it but many want to suppress it.' 

In the video, David Duke, a well-known white supremacist and anti-Semite, speaks about how Jews control the American media.

Dayana Jadarian, who is running in elections for the Swedish parliament, posted a video by a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan on her Facebook page in which he rants against Jewish people

However, she has now deleted that message and claims she was unaware that Duke was a former Klan Grand Wizard when she posted the clip, entitled 'The Insanity of Christian Zionism'. 

And she later added: 'It turned out that Duke was branded by some media as a racist. I had no information about that. Now, in the actual clip, there was nothing that was racist.

'I think that it's sick that I have to say it but I'm not a racist, never have been and never will be.'

The young woman is running as a Centre Party candidate for the Swedish parliament and calls herself ‘smart, sharp and gorgeous’ on Twitter. 

The young politician, who describes herself as 'smart, sharp and gorgeous' on Twitter, posted the clip featuring David Duke (right) along with the message: 'What he says is facts (sic) and everyone knows it'

Miss Jadarian is running for Sweden's Centre Party, whose party secretary Michael Arthursson has said candidates cannot have 'racist views' and stand for election.

However, she remains a candidate for the Centre Party in Sörmland and is listed on the party's website alongside four other members of the party.

The district chairman of the Centre party in Sörmland said that he had spoken to Miss Jadarian about the matter but that she is unlikely to be removed from the ballot.

The controversy comes barely 24 hours after a 20-year-old Sweden Democrat candidate quit after pictures emerged of her wearing a Nazi armband.
