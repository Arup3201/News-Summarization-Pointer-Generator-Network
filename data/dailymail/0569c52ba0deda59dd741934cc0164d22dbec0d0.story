A rail commuter whose trains were delayed more than 60 times last year has claimed back more than £1,000 in compensation. 

Tom Burridge makes the 50 minute journey from Colchester to London every day for work, spending £5,800 a year on a season ticket.

Every time the 31-year-old was delayed in 2014, he made a claim with Greater Anglia who duly awarded him vouchers for future travel. 

Tom Burridge, 31, was awarded more than £1,000 in rail vouchers after claiming compensation for delayed services throughout 2014

Over the course of the year he gathered £1,090 in compensation by using the company's Delay Repay scheme. 

'Any time I have a delay I have a point of making a claim,' Mr Burridge, an IT project manager said. 

'Season tickets are expensive so anything I can do to off-set it the better.

'It does make a difference. It's worth doing.

'I'm probably an extreme example because I travel more than the average person.'

After saving up his vouchers for months, Mr Burridge has put them towards his season ticket for the new year. 

'I knew it was going to take a few minutes so I made a point of going in when there wasn't going to be a massive queue of people,' he added. 

'I think there was a sharp intake of breath from the man when I handed over this wedge of vouchers.

Mr Burridge saved up dozens of compensation vouchers to put towards the cost of his annual season ticket

'There are a lot of people who aren't aware you can do this. This is money you're entitled to.'

A spokesman for Greater Anglia said a 'number of problems' had contributed to the company's poor performance over in recent months. 

All train services operating in the UK adhere to a Passenger's Charter. 

Below, different companies' criteria for making a compensation claim 

Greater Anglia

30 to 59 minutes: Compensation to the value of 50 per cent of the ticket

For more than an hour: Full value will be given in compensation 

East Coast and Virgin 

30 minutes to an hour: 50 per cent of the ticket value 

60 to 119 minutes: Compensation to the full value of single ticket and full value of relevant portion of return ticket (inbound or outbound) 

More than 119 minutes: Full compensation of the value of single and return tickets

South West

More than an hour:  Full value of single tickets, half the value of return tickets 

'Under the terms of our Passenger's Charter, passengers can claim compensation for any delay. 

'We are working closely with Network Rail to do all we can to improve service performance.'

Network Rail added services had not been 'good enough' and that Mr Burridge was doing 'the right thing' by claiming compensation.   

'Clearly, performance on the line from Colchester has not been good enough in recent months,' a spokesman said.

'This passenger is doing the right thing in claiming for his disrupted journeys and we can only apologise that the service has not been as reliable as it should be.'

It comes after hundreds were left stranded in the days after Christmas when overrunning engineering works closed King's Cross station in London, cancelling scores of services. 

Passengers who had spent hundreds securing seats in First Class carriages for cross-country journeys were forced to cram into the aisles and vestibules of already sold-out trains to get home as a result of the disruption. 

East Coast, which was the worst affected by the chaos, is inviting passengers to look into its refund scheme. 

The disruption, branded 'totally unacceptable' by the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin, is being investigated by the Office of Rail Regulation.

Widespread disruption on train lines closed King's Cross station in central London last week, with hundreds of passengers left stranded across the country

Railway season ticket prices have risen by as much as £1,900 in just four years.

Commuters on dozens of routes have faced increases of up to 30 per cent since 2010, according to Labour Party research. Over this time an annual ticket between Birmingham and London with Virgin Trains has gone from £8,028 to £9,916 – a surge of £1,888.

Routes between Chester and Manchester and between New Pudsey and Leeds have risen 30 per cent in price from 2010.

Michael Dugher, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: ‘David Cameron is presiding over a rip-off railway in Britain. He has failed to stand up for working people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and has allowed the train companies to hit passengers with massive fare rises.’

A separate report from rail unions found that a typical British worker would spend 17 per cent of their monthly wage on a season ticket.

The equivalent figure for Germany is 9 per cent, France 12 per cent and Spain and Italy both 6 per cent.

UK season ticket prices are rising by up to 2.5 per cent from today.
