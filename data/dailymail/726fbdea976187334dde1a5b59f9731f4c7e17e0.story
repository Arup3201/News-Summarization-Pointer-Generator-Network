A 58-year-old woman was facing jail last night for fraudulently trying to claim £740,000 after tripping over an uneven paving stone outside her home.

Barbara Fari sued Haringey Council in North London after the incident in May 2008, claiming that the injury to her right knee was so severe she required ongoing care.

The council admitted liability but the case went to trial after Ms Fari rejected their initial offer of a £7,500 settlement.

But Judge Christopher Mitchell struck out her claim in its entirety at Central London county court last week after deciding that the mother-of-13 had grossly exaggerated her claims.

Undercover surveillance had found that Ms Fari had a pre-existing deformity in her knee and that she had exaggerated the extent of her injuries sustained by the fall.

Judge Mitchell said the injury would have resulted in two to three months of discomfort and was worth no more than £1,500.

He said the claim had been a massive attempt to deceive the court and referred the matter to the High Court.

Ms Fari, who is on Income Support and disability benefits, may now face prosecution for contempt of court and a prison sentence.

Last night she denied overstating her injuries, saying ‘Four years later and I still have to walk with a walking stick and my knee is hurting me.

'After the accident I couldn’t even walk upstairs and I would just cry tears.'

The grandmother-of-14, who was born in Jamaica, said the accident has left her with chronic depression.

'The doctor told me there was nothing he could do and that I’d need a knee replacement.

'He told me, "Your knee is finished". But he told me that if I had an operation I could die because my diabetes is really bad.

'I became depressed because I couldn’t take my grandchildren out and I’d have to take a cab to the supermarket.'

Cllr Joe Goldberg said: ‘This woman thought that by telling lies she could pressure the council into wasting local taxpayers’ money forking out for a claim that was a blatant exaggeration. 

‘When we are confident that a claim against the council is wrong, we will fight it. We’re delighted that the judge dismissed this claim.’
