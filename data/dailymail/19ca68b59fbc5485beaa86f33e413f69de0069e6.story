Barcelona have taken the first step towards getting rid of paper tickets by introducing a new system involving supporters using their smartphones to gain access to the Nou Camp.

Instead of now having to print out tickets before the match, Barca fans will now be able to scan a bar-code on their phones to gain access to matches.  

The Catalan giants, who are currently second in La Liga, say the new system is already up and running and available for fans to use. 

Barcelona have introduced a new smartphone ticketing system for games at the Nou Camp 

1. Check you have the Passbook (iPhone, iPad) or PassWallet (Android) app installed.

2. Buy your match ticket on the club's website.

3. When you receive e-mail confirmation from the club, add your tickets to Passbook or PassWallet.

4. Scan the QR code at the stadium turnstiles.

Didac Lee, Barcelona's director for new technologies, told the club's website: 'The objective  is to bring the club closer to members and fans and we believe the mobile is the most useful tool to do this, because it is within everybody's reach and it opens us the possibility of making this relation easier.

'The mobile ticket scheme is an example of how technology can make access to the ground easier and more comfortable, and it is not the only service of this type. 

'Soon we will be announcing new functions for mobile devices that will allow fans and members to improve their experience with the club.'  

The new system will be available immediately, according to a club statement

Fans will buy tickets online then add the email confirmation to a smartphone app which can be scanned
