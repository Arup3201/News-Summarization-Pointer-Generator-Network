A leading charity was accused of making politically-motivated statements yesterday after it published a report claiming British parents can’t afford hot meals or new shoes for their children.

Save the Children called for an increase in benefits and state support for childcare to help families it claims are being ‘torn apart’ by poverty.

However critics last night highlighted the links between the charity’s chief executive and Labour.

Boarded up houses in Toxteth, Liverpool, one of the most deprived areas of the UK. A leading children's charity has said that poverty is tearing many of Britain's poorest families apart

Justin Forsyth, the charity’s £162,000-a-year boss, is a former adviser to Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Analysts were also sceptical about the depth of research that went into the study.

Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton,
said: ‘This report is about the prejudices of the people who work for 
this charity.

'It doesn’t tell us what really needs to be done about the 
welfare system.’

Crisis: The charity believes many parents are buckling under the pressure of mounting bills and their children are seeing them argue more about money

The charity’s report, Child Poverty in
2012, said 61 per cent of parents say they have cut back on food in the
past year, and 26 per cent say they have skipped meals.

Around one in five parents, according to the survey, say their children have to go without new shoes when they need them.

The report also said that nearly one 
in five children said they missed going on school trips and one in seven
said they did not have a winter coat.

The report included information from 1,504 children aged between eight and 16 from 35 schools, who filled in an online survey.

It also took in a survey of 5,000 parents, but the report contained no details of how this element of the survey was conducted.

Author on the family, Patricia Morgan, said: ‘I wish we were being told who these families are.

‘As it stands I can’t take this report seriously.

‘Save the Children is a charity that 
depends for its income on telling us that everybody is poor. I would 
like to see more independent evidence.’
