He's back: Darwin Vela, 22, was located Friday afternoon after going missing two days ago while walking his Chocolate Lab, who returned home with blood on his leash

A California man who disappeared while walking his dog the day before he was supposed to testify in a burglary case involving Nicolas Cage’s ex-girlfriend turned up alive today.

Darwin Vela, 22, was located at about 1.30pm, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a written statement. There was no immediate word on his condition.

‘The detectives are talking to him to find out the circumstances’ of his disappearance, Officer Gregory Baek said.

TMZ reported Friday that Vela allegedly told police that he was kidnapped, but he somehow managed to get away from his abductors and asked a passerby to call 911.

Vela was last seen around 9 p.m. Tuesday when he took his 3-year-old chocolate Labrador, Koco, for a walk in South Los Angeles.

His fiancee, Kelly McLaren, said the dog later returned to their home hunched over and 'crying' with a 6-inch smear of blood on its leash.

No one heard from Vela, who was recently unemployed, and he had left his cellphone, wallet and keys at home, McLaren said.

On Friday, an officer at LAPD's Pacific Station in the Del Rey neighborhood told McLaren and Vela’s mother that the 22-year-old was 'bruised' but otherwise fine, KTLA reported.

Vela was last seen leaving his home in the 2900 block of South Redondo Boulevard about 9pm on Tuesday, according to Los Angeles police.

A short time later police said the dog returned alone.

Missing: Darwin Vela, 22, went for a walk with his dog in Los Angeles on Tuesday night and never returned

Witnesses: Vela and his girlfriend, Kelly McLaren were scheduled to testify against a man who is standing trial for breaking into the home of Nicholas Cage's ex-girlfriend, Christina Fulton

Vela’s girlfriend said she noticed blood on the dog’s leash, according to KTLA.

'He [the dog] was crying, and Darwin wasn't anywhere,' McLaren said. 'So I took the leash, and I noticed on the leash there was a thumb print of blood and a drag mark, where it looked like the leash had been pulled from his arm.'

Vela has never gone missing before and his family and friends are very concerned for his safety, police said.

McLaren fears Vela’s disappearance could be linked to a high profile case the couple is involved in, in which they were both expected to testify.

‘We were witnesses to a crime and we were supposed to testify today,’ McLaren told KTLA.

The crime was a break-in at the home of actor Nicolas Cage's ex-girlfriend, Christina Fulton, earlier this year.

The home of actress Christina Fulton, who is the mother of Cage’s son, Weston Coppola Cage, was broken into earlier this year, according to Gawker.

Weston, 22,  was the lead singer of the 
black metal band Eyes Of Noctum that disbanded last year and has since 
joined metal band Arsh Anubis.

Fulton, who dated Cage from 1988 to 1990, has had roles in films as The 
Doors, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Dangerous Game, The Girl with the Hungry 
Eyes, Enemies of Laughter, Lucinda's Spell and Snake Eyes.

Cage has been married three times with his marriages to actress Patricia Arquette and Lisa Marie Presley ending in divorce.

The actor, who is the nephew of Godfather producer Francis Ford Coppola, married his third 
wife Alice Kim, a former waitress, in 2004. They have 
eight-year-old son Kal-El together.

Police arrested Fulton's handyman,

computers and a box of sex pictures.

Orozco is currently being held on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to the crime.
