David Cameron today challenged the Emir of Qatar to stop the flow of cash to ISIS - following bombshell allegations in Parliament that the country is 'siphoning off' funds meant for the World Cup to fund Islamic terror.

The Prime Minister held talks with the Qatari leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Than amid increasing concerns over the wealthy Arab state's links to Islamic extremism and the deadly conditions migrant labourers are forced to live in.

Qatar is part of the military coalition against the militants, but elements within the wealthy state have been accused of bankrolling the militants.

Mr Cameron was challenged in the House of Commons today to raise the issue of ISIS funding with Qatar's leader

During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was asked whether he agreed with the US assessment that Qatar was 'a permissive jurisdiction for terrorist finance'. 

Mr Cameron said: 'I will be talking to the Emir very shortly, and of course we will discuss all these issues, particularly how we can work together to combat extremism.'

He added: 'It really does matter that we work with all our allies to ensure that extremist and terrorist groups do not get the support that they seem to be.

The exchange came after ministers were  called on to investigate reports that British companies were being short-changed on World Cup construction contracts - with funds being siphoned off to Syria for ISIS.

Downing Street insisted 'no issues' would be 'off the table' during the meeting with the Qatari leader at Number 10 this afternoon

Asked earlier this week whether Mr Cameron would challenge the Emir on reports that elements in his country have channelled funds ISIS, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'I'm sure the PM will talk about the work being done by both countries in terms of tackling terrorism.

'Qatar is part of the coalition of countries participating in airstrikes against Isil in Syria. All countries are taking forward anti-terror financing work consistent with the UN Security Council Resolution in August.

'I'm sure they will discuss a range of issues to do with combating terror in that region.' 

The Emir is in London for a three-day state visit to Britain, beginning today. The country has rejected accusations that it is funnelling cash to ISIS

Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani were welcomed to the UK by the Queen at Buckingham Palace 

The spokesman added that Mr Cameron would also raise concerns about conditions for stadium construction workers.

The spokesman said: 'He will be discussing that with the Emir. The Qatari authorities themselves have in recent months announced a series of changes and reforms.

'I'm sure there will be an opportunity for the Prime Minister to ask how that is going and to continue to make the offer of UK expertise and learning from our experience of construction of the various pieces of infrastructure associated with the London 2012 Olympics.' 

Allegations of corruption during the bidding process for the 2022 tournament have also dogged Qatar and the high death rate on match sites has sparked international condemnation.

 The spokesman said the question of whether Qatar should host the World Cup was 'a matter for Fifa', adding: 'The right thing to do is, where and if we can be of assistance to Qatar as it develops its infrastructure ahead of that tournament, to offer it.'

During the talks in Downing Street, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond signed a cultural agreement with his counterpart Khalid Mohammed al-Attiyah, which officials said was in 'recognition of our long-standing friendship' with Qatar.

Qatar last night refuted was claims that money for UK firms working on World Cup 2022 venues is being siphoned off to ISIS extremists.

The country's Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani told MailOnline it is a 'serious allegation' which the government 'refutes completely'. 

Labour MP Steve Rotheram raised the cases in Parliament ahead of David Cameron holding talks with the Emir of Qatar tomorrow.

Qatar controversially won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, despite widespread concern that soaring temperatures will make games impossible to play.

Several British construction firms have won contracts to work for big Qatari firms on building venues in the country.

However, Mr Rotherham claimed that companies have had money withheld which has been redirected to Islamic extremists in Syria.

In a statement, the Qatari Prime Minister said: 'It is a serious allegation and it is one we refute completely.

'Let me be clear, for the avoidance of doubt, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Middle East and around the world to face down the terrorist threat.'

Earlier in the Commons, Mr Rotherham, the MP for Liverpool Walton, called on ministers to examine the allegations. 

Speaking during Foreign Office question time, Mr Rotheram said: 'There are accusations that some UK companies are being short-changed on contracts associated with the construction of World Cup venues in Qatar and even claims that some monies unpaid are being siphoned off to Syria and into the hands of Isil.'

He told Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood: 'Can you look urgently to these allegations and can you offer support to UK firms regarding their reimbursement by the Qatari royalty, government or businesses?'

Mr Ellwood replied: 'I was in Doha last week and I raised this very issue. They do what is called a kafala system which has now been upgraded, which you may be aware of.

'It is being replaced to give greater rights to migrant workers - there's 1.3 million in Qatar - but also giving responsibilities to the employers as well to make sure they look after these.' 

In August Qatar denied supporting ISIS militants, insisting that 'determined, collective action' was needed to end sectarian violence in Iraq and Syria.

And  officials including Qatar's director of intelligence told the BBC that the country only supported moderate rebel groups in Syria and 'had nothing to hide'.

It is claimed British firms working on Qatar World Cup venues have been denied money which has been redirected to ISIS extremists

Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar, is  visiting London this week to promote economic investment in Britain

But this week a US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington believes Turkey is partnering with Qatar in providing support to Islamist factions and militias in Libya. 

At the weekend Tory MP Stephen Barclay told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It remains unclear whether money is still flowing from Qatari nationals.

'There is clear evidence that Qatari nationals have been instrumental in the financing of Sunni terror groups and the Prime Minister should not avoid tackling this issue head on with the Emir.'
