No summer series of TOWIE would be complete without a trip to the party-loving city of Marbella, or 'Marbs' as the people of Essex, and the resort's biggest fans, like to call it.

Fans are hoping for sun, sea, sand and serious amounts of drama on the Costa del Sol coastline and the cast are living by the mantra 'No carbs 
before Marbs' as they prepare their bodies and wardrobes for some serious poolside posing.

Cast member Bobby Cole Norris, however, has taken preparation for the overseas trip one step further by spending two days in London's Stansted airport conquering his fear of flying.

The 24-year-old hairdresser has hated flying since a child. And rather than looking forward to a few fun-filled weeks away with his Essex gang, and planning how many pairs of sunglasses to take, he has spent weeks worrying about the flight.

He said: 'The beach outfits are planned, sunglasses collection ready to be showcased and the tan applied but having to fly has always put a dark cloud over the whole holiday.

'Sitting at the airport gate I have always been the one looking nervously out on the runway biting my nails. For me it’s the noises. I sit there listening to every bang and whirling, thinking it’s a signal that we are doomed to drop out of the sky any minute!'

Bobby's not alone, it is estimated that one in six people are scared of flying. But the former party-planner, and show's resident GBF, has managed to conquer his fear for good with an intensive two-day course.

The £189 Fear Of Flying course held by easyJet consists of a three-hour ground session presented by phobia expert Lawrence Leyton, star of Channel 4’s Fear of Flying programme and senior easyJet pilot, Captain Chris Foster.

They teach participants a set of mind 
techniques as well as explaining what every noise, bang and whirling 
sound is at every stage of a flight.

The following day, participants are taken on a test flight to put the skills they have learnt to the test.

Success: Bobby tweeted a picture of his easyJet certificate saying: 'All ready for Marbs. Thank you.'

Following the course Bobby said: 'I feel so E-mosh! I can honestly say that this course has changed my life.

'Waking
 up the morning after the ground session I felt completely different; I 
didn’t feel sick or anxious and was looking forward to the flight – 
something which I haven’t ever done. After 14 years of being scared of 
flying I now realise I was only scared of the air con noises! I only 
wish I had come on this sooner.

'All ready for Marbs. Thank you.'

Nervous: Bobby couldn't hide his nerves when travelling to Spain in 2013 next to cast member Ricky Rayment

Bobby's co-star James 'Arg' Argent confirmed that the show was heading there last month in an interview with BBC Radio 2.

He said: 'We're filming the next series in Marbella, so I'm presuming there's going to be a lot of pool party scenes with my top off. I don't want to end up looking like a beach whale so fingers crossed in about six weeks time I'll be nice and healthy and all tanned up in Marbella!'
