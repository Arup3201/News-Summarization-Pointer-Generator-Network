Protests over the American anti-Islam film that has sparked chaos across the Muslim world continued in London yesterday as thousands of demonstrators marched on the offices of Google.

More than 3,500 British Muslims, some from as far afield as Glasgow, waved banners and chanted slogans outside the search engine's UK headquarters to demand the company removes the film from the internet.

The low-budget movie, entitled The Innocence of Muslims, portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a 
fool and a sexual deviant, and has sparked a torrent of anti-American unrest
in Arab and Muslim countries since its release on YouTube last month.

Anger: Barricades were erected as thousands of Muslims marched with banners bearing an array of slogans

But Google, who own the video-sharing website, remained defiant today claiming the film is 'clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube'.

A spokesman for the company said: 'We work hard to create a community 
everyone can enjoy and which also enables people to express different 
opinions.

'This can be a challenge because what's OK in one country can be offensive elsewhere.'

The protest had been billed as a precursor to a million-strong march planned in Hyde Park in the coming weeks.

Slogans: Muslims from all backgrounds waved placards bearing slogans such as 'We love our prophet more than our lives' and 'Prophet Muhammad is the founder of freedom of speech' as well as these above

Organiser Masoud Alam told the Daily Telegraph: 'Our next protest will be at the offices of Google and YouTube across the world. We are looking to ban this film.

'This is not freedom of expression, there is a limit for that. This insult of the Prophet will not be allowed.'

Muslims from all backgrounds chanted and waved placards bearing slogans such as 'We love our prophet more than our lives' 
and 'Prophet Muhammad is the founder of freedom of speech'.

They also listened to speeches from imams in English, Urdu and Arabic.

One of the speakers, Sheikh Faiz Al-Aqtab Siddiqui, told The Daily Telegraph: 'Terrorism 
is not just people who kill human bodies, but who kill human feelings as 
well. The makers of this film have terrorised 1.6 billion people.'

The march, during which no arrests were made, was in stark contrast to the wave of violent riots that spread across the Muslim world in the wake of the 14-minute film a month ago.

It first erupted a day after a 
separate attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that killed 
four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya on September 11.

and three other American personnel

The most violent protests came over four days of demonstrations across the Arab world, stretching 
from Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon, Palestinian territories, Israel, 
Sudan, Nigeria, Tunisia and Pakistan, and even Australia.

YouTube has already blocked access to the video in some countries such as Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and India.

Stand off: A defiant protester taunts the police phalanx from the top of an upturned and burned-out car in Cairo

But anti-American sentiment fostered by the film's release has shown little sign of abating.

On Friday, Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri said the film 
showed Washington was waging a 'crusader Zionist war' against Muslims 
and he called for a Holy War against America.

Like
in other messages released by al Qaeda's Yemeni and North African 
branches last month, Zawahiri praised last month's assault on the U.S. 
consulate in Benghazi that killed four diplomats but stopped short of 
claiming responsibility.

anti-Israeli slogans during a protest against a low-budget US film that
depicts the Prophet Mohammed in Srinagar in September

Fury: Indian Muslim women shout slogans against America because of the film made in US called 'Innocence of 
Muslims' which ridicules Islam's Prophet Muhammad, in Chennai, India

In
the recording, posted on Islamist websites on Friday, he called on 
'free and distinguished zealots for Islam' who attacked the consulate 
and protested outside other American embassies to 'continue their 
opposition to American crusader Zionist aggression against Islam and 
Muslims'.

The offending 14-minute video behind the 
unrest was made privately and amateurishly by an American company and spoofs the life and times of 
the Prophet Muhammad.

Washington, however, has condemned the film and said it does not condone any insult to any religion.

In hiding: Last week, the man behind the video emerged from hiding to appear in court in Los Angeles to deny he had violated his probation for a previous check fraud conviction

conviction.

The Egyptian born filmmaker, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula,
fled his California home on September 11, in the aftermath of the 
release of his controversial video.

He denied in court that he committed eight probation violations, 
including lying to officials over the scope his role in the film and 
using aliases.
