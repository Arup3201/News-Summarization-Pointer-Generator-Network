Chelsea started off their Champions League campaign with a disappointing 1-1 draw at home to German outfit Schalke.

Cesc Fabregas scored his first goal for the club to give them a first-half lead but as well as Didier Drogba was guilty of missing a gilt edged chance to increase the lead, with the hosts made to pay for their missed chances, as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's second half goal secured a draw for the visitors.

Here, Sportsmail's Rob Draper gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players. 

Cesc Fabregas coolly slots the ball home past Ralf Fährmann to give Chelsea the lead against Schalke

 CHELSEA (4-4-1-1)

THIBAUT COURTOIS - When called upon was excellent, notably with his save from Boateng's strike on 39 miutes. 7.

BRANISLAV IVANOVIC  - Possibly Chelsea's best player other than Costa this season and good again on Tuesday night. 7.

JOHN TERRY - Not the steady performance expected. Struggled against a good attack. 5.5.

GARY CAHILL- Like Terry, unassured. Let Draxler run through the middle of him and Terry in the first half. 5.5.

FILIPE LUIS - No more than steady. Likely to be replaced by Azpilcueta on Sunday. 6.

NEMANJA MATIC -  Provides the core of this Chelsea side, an increasingly influential figure at the base of midfield. 6.5.

RAMIRES - Workmanlike rather than inspired. Did his job for 40 minutes, but then game began to run away from Chelsea's midfield. 6.

WILLIAN -  Good in all fits and starts, with bright runs every now and then but never enough to be decisive. 6.

CESC FABREGAS - Lucky to score as he fouled Meyer in the build up; missed a great chance to make it 2-0; lost possession for Schalke's equaliser. 6.

EDEN HAZARD - Terrified Schalke early on. Chelsea's most inventive player. But missed late volleyed chance and denied by Fahrmann on 85 minutes. 7.5

DIDIER DROGBA - Not the Drogba of old. A yard slower, a degree less frightening. It's not the same. 5.5.

SUBS:  

OSCAR - Brought on to add more flair and helped lift Chelsea. 6.5.

LOIC REMY - Great strike on 78 minutes that was headed off line by Neustadter. 6.5.

DIEGO COSTA - Not enough time to make his customary impact. 6.

MANAGER: JOSE MOURINHO - Tried to lift his team with substitutions but it was a flat night for Chelsea. 6.

MARCO HOGER - Had the misfortune to be up against Hazard. 5.5.

AYHAN - For one so young, acquitted himself well. Schalke had three centre halves out injured. 7.

ROMAN NEUSTADER - Superb header off the line to stop Remy's shot and dealt well with Drogba. 7.

CHRISTIAN FUCHS - Grew into the game and contributed to manfully to Schalke's back line. 6.

SIDNEY SAM - Didn't stop running and caused Chelsea occasional shaky moments. 6.

KEVIN PRINCE-BOATENG - His aggression threatens to get the better of him - but he is a vital cog in this Schalke side. 7.

DENNIS AOGO - At times over-run but kept his head and helped Schalke back into the game. 6.5.

JULIAN DRAXLER - A constant thorn in Chelsea's side, strolling through the wide spaces in midfield to set up equaliser. 8.

MAX MEYER - Unlucky to concede possession for Chelsea's goal when he was fouled by Fabregas. 6.

KLAAS-JAN HUNTELAAR - A captain's performance. Held the line wonderfully and took his goal brilliantly. 7.5.

SUBS:

CHINEDU OBASI - (86 mins - no mark)

MANAGER:  JENS KELLER - Under pressure, this was a huge performance from his team. 8.

REFEREE: IVAN BEBEK (Croatia) - Missed the foul in the build up to Chelsea's goal; otherwise passable. 5.5.
