Bolton fans were given their first taste of Emile Heskey in a Wanderers shirt on Monday evening as the veteran forward played an hour for their Under 21 side.

The 36-year-old managed 63 minutes in the 3-1 defeat by Reading in the Premier League Cup before being replaced by Jamie Thomas.

Heskey has been training with the club since early December and is hopeful of securing a short-term deal with the Championship side.

The former England centre forward has been out of contract since leaving A-League side the Newcastle Jets at the end of their season and could not get the better of Niall Keown, son of Sportsmail columnist Martin.

However, Bolton manager Neil Lennon said on Tuesday: 'I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw of Emile in the Under 21s on Monday evening. He was very impressive.'

Eidur Gudjohnsen is also back at the club and the former Barcelona man was full of praise for his new club-mate.

He said: 'He's a physical presence and you can still see it. There's not much changed in him. If he wants to play and if he's hungry to play then I'd love for him to be with us.

'Any bit of quality, any bit of experience, any bit of competition within the group is always helpful and whether it's him or other players, we want to find a healthy competition to get the best out of each other.'
