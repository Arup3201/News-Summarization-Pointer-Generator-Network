Snubbed: Angelina Jolie's Unbroken only received a single SAG nomination - in the stunt category 

She has described her latest directing project Unbroken as 'the hardest thing I've ever done', but Angelina Jolie's efforts were snubbed at the SAG Awards nominations on Wednesday.  

Unbroken received a single nomination in the less showy category of Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble, but the film's leading man Jack O'Connell missed out on an acting nod.

Jolie's snub came as Jennifer Aniston celebrated a nomination in the Outstanding Actress category for her performance as a woman racked with chronic pain in indie drama Cake.

Other big movies not considered in any of the acting categories - including the prestigious Outstanding Ensemble award - include Christopher Nolan's space fantasy movie Interstellar and Martin Luther King film Selma, although the latter's omission is possibly due to a late send out of screeners to Academy members.

Matthew McConaughey movie Interstellar's poor performance could be partially due to its mixed reviews and  less than stellar performance at the U.S box office.

Meanwhile, star-studded Rob Marshall-directed musical Into The Woods landed Meryl Streep yet another nomination for her role as The Witch but the movie - set to be released this Christmas- missed out in the Ensemble category.

And despite Rosamund Pike being nominated as Outstanding Lead Actress, Gone Girl  didn't win any acclaim for its star-studded cast which included Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry.

Among the actors, Jessica Chastain's lack of nomination for A Most Violent Year as the wife of a shady oil salesman in 1981 New York City, was surprising to many commentators, while Hilary Swank missed out for Western The Homesman and Amy Adams was omitted for Tim Burton's Big Eyes.

A Supporting Actress slot was also expected to be filled by Laura Dern for her acclaimed turn as Reese Witherspoon's mother in Wild, but the nod instead went to Naomi Watts for playing a pregnant prostitute in Bill Murray comedy St Vincent.

Murray missed out for his drunken, gambling retiree in St.Vincent but maybe it's no surprise that Timothy Spall was overlooked in Mr Turner, with the category described by Variety as 'one of the most competitive and crowded ever'.

The same goes for Bradley Cooper, who despite beefing up for the role of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle in American Sniper, didn't get a nod for the Clint Eastwood-directed drama about Kyle, who was involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda.

But will he get an Oscar nod? Selma star David Oyelowo missed out on a SAG nomination, reportedly because not enough screeners of the Martin Luther King film get sent out in time 

British actor David Oyelowo was also widely anticipated to make the cut in the Outstanding Lead Actor category for playing Martin Luther King in Ava DuVernay’s drama Selma about 1965 civil rights marches.

According to Variety, Selma will almost certainly be one of the frontrunners come Oscar time, alongside war time codebreaker drama The Imitation Game and Richard Linklater's groundbreaking drama Boyhood, famously shot over an 11 year period and starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette.  

Less than stellar: Christopher Nolan film Interstellar starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway was not recognised by SAG

Scoop for Meryl: Streep received yet another nomination but musical Into The Woods missed out

Over on the Vv side, Jon Hamm and Mad Men were snubbed for the second year running, with nominations in the Lead TV Actor category instead going to Boardwalk Empire's Steve Buscemi, Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones, Kevin Spacey for House Of Cards and True Detective's Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey.

It is also the first time in four years that Jessica Lange has not received a nod in the Outstanding Leading Drama Actress category for American Horror Story. 

And perhaps in an indication that SAG members very much dance to their own tune, Martin Freeman, who scooped an Emmy for playing Dr Watson in Sherlock, missed out on a nomination for the BBC drama at the SAGs.

New dramas were also snubbed, with Amazon's Transparent, Showtime's The Affair and HBO drama The Leftovers getting short shrift.

SAG nominees are voted by their peers with 4,200 members of the guild randomly selected each year to nominate their favourites. 

The voters are split in half, with 2,100 weighing in on television performances and the other 2,100 deciding who will be honoured for outstanding performances in film.

Following the polling process the full body of both SAG and AFTRA (Hollywood's acting unions) then decides upon the winners in each category. 

The SAG Award winners will be announced on January 25 2015.
