Dylan Paton who died after collapsing at home. Twenty people were arrested after a brawl broke out following his funeral

Twenty people  - including a 12-year-old child - have been arrested after a massive brawl broke out following the funeral of a teenager.

The large scale disturbance followed the wake for 16-year-old Dylan Paton,who died after collapsing at home in June.

Hundreds of people had gathered in the street in the Craigneuk area of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, where Dylan lived with his family, and witnesses said mourners fought running battles with officers and damaged force vehicles.

Police Scotland said officers were sent to the scene around 9.15pm on Monday and a police helicopter was deployed.

A spokesman confirmed 20 people aged between 12 and 45 years old had been arrested following the incident and are due to appear in court.

They are still investigating and have appealed for witnesses to come forward, with further arrests are expected in the coming days.

Footage of the incident, which shows young people lunging at police and throwing bottles, has been posted online.

One witness said: 'It was absolute chaos. Loads of people were gathered in the street because they had been at the funeral earlier in the day.

'Just after 9 o’clock something kicked off and the police were called to the street.

'It developed into a stand off between the people on the street and the police. There was fighting and bottles being smashed.

'At one point the police closed off the street and people living there couldn’t get in or out.'

Dylan collapsed at his home last month and was transferred to Wishaw General Hospital after emergency services rushed to the scene.

Family members held a vigil at his bedside but he died the following day. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances.

Hundreds of mourners turned out to pay tribute to him on Monday afternoon at Craigneuk Parish Church.
