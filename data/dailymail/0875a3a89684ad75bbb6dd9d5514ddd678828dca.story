Should Rangers win promotion to the Premiership this season they will have to pay Newcastle United £500,000 as part of the loan deal struck with the St James' Park club for five players.

The details emerged this morning as Rangers released financial results which showed the club had made losses after tax of £2.89m for the six-month period to 31 December 2014.

Interim chairman Paul Murray described the accounts as 'disappointing'.

This arrangement with Newcastle was part of a deal struck by the previous board for five fringe players - Gael Bigirimana, Haris Vuckic, Kevin Mbabu, Remie Streete and Shane Ferguson. Only Vuckic has made any sort of impact for the Ibrox club so far.

Indeed three of the five players who signed the loan agreements have yet to kick a ball for Rangers, who are currently second in the Championship and can only now be promoted through the play-offs.

The prize money for finishing as runners-up in the second tier is £342,000.

Despite promotion to the Championship, revenue fell £100,000 to £13.1m, though the club earned £1.3m from hosting the Commonwealth Games rugby sevens. Sponsorship revenue also dropped, falling by £0.3m to £0.4m.

Murray, who along with Dave King and John Gilligan, ousted the previous board, said: 'The new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club, its people and its history.

'The mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering.

'As the Interim Accounts prove, the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts.

'We can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning, investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders.

'Too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular. But they are gone now and this is a new era for this great and special club which must be regenerated, not only for its own good but for the greater good of Scottish football.'
