Mark Hughes is mindful that Bojan runs the risk of burnout over the festive period but insists the Spaniard won’t receive any special treatment this month.

The 24-year-old, billed as world football’s next superstar while a teenager at Barcelona, has never had to deal with England’s festive football, given clubs on the continent enjoy a winter break.

Bojan, whose side injury sustained during Saturday’s draw isn’t a worry, has become the focal point of a Potters side. Hughes admitted having spoken about giving the playmaker a rest in the coming weeks but wants him starting as much as possible.

James McArthur scored his first Premier League goal since netting for Wigan in a 3-2 win at West Brom in May 2013. 

‘He’s really enjoying his football and playing week in, week out,’ the Stoke boss said. ‘If we can ride that wave to a certain extent, he’s happy with what he’s doing and how he’s playing. I think we just go with it.

‘We’ll see how it goes and we’re mindful of the fact that it you’ve not been through it before it can be a hard period for players.’

Stoke were poor at Selhurst Park and Hughes reasoned that they missed Bojan’s presence after he departed just after the break. Goalscorer Peter Crouch is thriving alongside him, adding: ‘He can create a bit of magic and in these games that’s what you need, someone to unlock it.’

Neil Warnock knows he needs ‘two or three’ new signings in January but is upset at the lack of urgency of some players, including striker Dwight Gayle.

‘He hasn’t pushed himself into pole position in training,’ the manager said. ‘I was disappointed when he came on. He’s not really knocked my door down in training.’
