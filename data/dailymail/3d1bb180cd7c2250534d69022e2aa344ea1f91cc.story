It's not quite bargain basement, but a rare opportunity to buy the world's fastest production car for less than a quarter of the price has arisen.

For £200,000 you could get the keys to a Bugatti Veyron, which costs a cool £1million brand new.

It's an amazing reduction, but there's a downside - you'll need another £500,000 to repair the supercar, because the owner crashed it.

Damage: A Bugatti Veyron is being auctioned off in Switzerland after the unlucky owner lost control of it on the A2 motorway in Austria

Bargain: The Veyron is expected to fetch around £200,000 - about a quarter the cost of a new model

The wreck is being auctioned off in Switzerland after the unlucky owner lost control of it on the A2 motorway in Austria in pouring rain. The Bugatti slid off the road and down a 120-foot embankment.

The driver did have some luck, though, as he emerged unscathed. But his car suffered considerable damage to its bodywork, suspension and wheels.

It may be a six-year-old model but the cheapest second-hand Veyron currently on the market is priced at £675,000.

The auctioneers, who expect the car to fetch around £200,00 say that there is damage to 'front and rear, front sill, both doors and the floor of the vehicle.' Repairs are estimated at around £550,000.

The Veyron has a top speed of 253mph, though Top Gear's James May reached 259mph in a test run at the VW test track in Germany in a sports version of the car.

The W16-formation eight-litre engine pushes out around 1,000 horsepower - the equivalent of five Honda Civics - and takes just 2.4 seconds to hit 62mph and gets to 150mph in under ten seconds but driven flat out it will return just 3.6 miles to the gallon.

Brisk: The Veyron has a top speed of 253mph, though Top Gear's James May reached 259mph in a test run at the VW test track in Germany in a sports version of the car

Lucky: The owner was fortunate to walk away from the crash unscathed
