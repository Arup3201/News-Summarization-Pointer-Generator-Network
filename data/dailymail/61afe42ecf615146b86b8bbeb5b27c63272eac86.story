Even before voters went to the polls to decide who would be the next Senator of Louisiana, the Republican National Committee was preparing for a run-off situation that would require dozens of campaign operatives to spend the next month in the state campaigning for Republican Bill Cassidy.

By election night the number of RNC staffers airlifting into the state on Wednesday had ballooned to 300 people as Louisiana officials confirmed that a second election would be held on Dec. 6.

Neither Cassidy, the top Republican in the race, nor sitting Sen. Mary Landrieu were able to beat back a cadre of other candidates challenging them for the seat and reach the state's required 50 percent mark.

Help is on the way! The Republican Party announced tonight that it would send 300 operatives to Louisiana to help Congressman Bill Cassidy in the Senate runoff

Incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu acknowledges supporters at her election night headquarters in New Orleans. Landrieu immediately began attacking her opponent on Tuesday night after she learned that they would again face off next month as a result of the state's jungle primary

Louisiana's jungle general elections allows for any candidate who fulfills state requirements to appear on the ballot. As a result eight candidates were allowed compete in today's election, including four Democrats and three Republicans.

The only candidate to garner more than one percent of the vote, however, besides frontrunners Cassidy and Landrieu, was Republican Rob Maness, who siphoned off just over 14 percent of the vote from fellow Republican Cassidy.

With Maness and the other candidates gone from the race, polls predict that Cassidy with sail to victory in next month's redo election.

National Republicans were already preparing for a run-off scenario in Louisiana for weeks before Election Day and planned to send in staffers of all types to aid Cassidy, who currently represents Louisiana in Congress.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus confirmed on Tuesday that the national party had already locked down hotels for the staffers for the duration of the ongoing campaign season.

Priebus made the announcement from the jam-packed lobby of the party committee's Washington, D.C. headquarters on the edge of Capitol Hill.

At the time Republicans were still waiting on the results in several key states that would determine whether their party would take over the Senate, including Georgia, which also called for a run off if no candidate topped 50 percent.

In the end, the GOP came out on top on Tuesday, gaining just enough seats to take control of the Senate just after 11 p.m. 

Landrieu needed to win 50 percent of the vote to keep her seat outright. Now she will have to square of again against Cassidy on Dec. 6. Polls give Cassidy the upper hand

Blocks away the Democratic National Committee was mum as the majority and the last two years of President Barack Obama's term slipped out of the party's reach.

The political organization declined to have a victory party this year, likely in anticipation of a GOP wave and its chairman did not hold a briefing with the press. A request for comment on the results of Landrieu's race was not immediately returned by the DNC, either.

A half hour before Midnight Cassidy emerged online to acknowledge his supporters and the battle ahead. 

'Thanks to everyone who supported me today. We sent an important message to Washington: we're ready for new, conservative leadership,' he wrote. 

'Thanks to everyone who supported me today. We sent an important message to Washington: we're ready for new, conservative leadership,' Cassidy said in a follow-up tweet.

While Cassidy was thanking his supporters, Landrieu was already back in campaign mindset.

'This race is about the future.The bright & strong future that Louisiana deserves. Join us for the next 32 days,' she tweeted from her campaign account.

Moments later she began re-attacking Cassidy over his policy positions.

'Where was Congressman Cassidy when Louisiana women fought for equal pay?' she said, linking to a website that ponders where Cassidy was when women, veterans, seniors, students and disaster survivors needed him most.

Polling site Real Clear Politics gives Landrieu unfavorable odds at winning the run-off election. On average, surveys of the state taken in the last week give Cassidy a 4.8 percent lead in the one-on-one.
