A farmer’s daughter who claims she had to stay at home and tend the cows while her teenage siblings went dancing is suing her elderly parents for a share of their £7million estate.

Eirian Davies, 45, insists she was repeatedly assured by her mother and father that she would take over the family’s thriving farm and its herd of pedigree Holstein cows.

She says she is owed a substantial stake in 200-acre Caeremlyn Farm for her years of toil. But Tegwyn and Mary Davies, now in their 70s, are fighting her claim at the Court of Appeal.

Family at war: Eirian Davies, 45, left, says she is entitled to a stake the dairy business in Helland, Dyfed, owned by her parents Tegwyn and Mary, right, after spending more than 25 years working long hours for them

Miss Davies told an earlier court 
hearing that she missed out on going to Young Farmers’ Club dances with 
her two sisters as a teenager because she had to stay at home in 
Whitland, Dyfed, and complete her farming chores.

Her parents said her patience would one day be rewarded, she claimed.

‘They
 always told me that the farm would be left to me,’ she told Judge 
Milwyn Jarman QC. ‘Even on my birthday … they would say, “You will have 
the damn lot one day, it will all be yours”.’

The
 judge found Miss Davies had ‘established an entitlement to a beneficial
 interest in the farm or farming business’ but her parents are 
challenging the ruling.

Timothy
 Fancourt QC, representing Mr Davies, 75, and his 76-year-old wife, 
argued their daughter had earned a fair income working on the farm and 
was provided with ‘bed and board’.

The
 couple put Miss Davies through agricultural college, he said, adding: 
‘She said in terms that agriculture was her love and she wanted to be on
 the farm.’

'Not fair': Miss Davies says she worked 'extremely long hours' tending cows while her sisters went to Young Farmers' Club dances

The court heard 
that even when Miss Davies worked elsewhere she failed to boost her 
earnings Mr Fancourt pointed out that she only earned £5,000 as a 
consultant for Slimming World in 2006.

‘So when the opportunity is there to do something else, she does worse,’ the barrister told the court.

He
 said there was no evidence she would have been better off had she not 
worked on the farm and insisted she had suffered no ‘substantial 
detriment’ by relying on anything her parents had said or done.

But Leslie Blohm QC, for Miss Davies, said promises were made by the couple from 1985, when their daughter was 17.

The court heard she worked ‘extremely long hours’ with the cows, sometimes unpaid.

If
 she complained to her parents about meagre wages, she was told the farm
 would ultimately belong to her – and ‘not to kill the goose that laid 
the golden egg’, Mr Blohm added.

'Golden egg': Miss Davies argues that her parents told her 'You'll have the whole damn lot one day'

Although
 the earlier hearing found Miss Davies had ‘walked away from the farm’ 
for periods between 1989 and 2008, she moved back home following a 
reconciliation with her parents.

Mr
 Davies made a ‘representation’ that she could live rent-free for life 
in a farmhouse on the estate, Mr Blohm said, and in 2009, a pledge that 
she would inherit the farm was made in a draft will.

But
 after a final family ‘rupture’ in late 2012, her parents gave her 
notice to leave the farmhouse. Possession proceedings followed, but Miss
 Davies insisted she was entitled to a stake.

Mr
 Blohm added: ‘It is plain from the evidence that a talented, 
hard-working and capable lady has spent a substantial part of her adult 
life – over a period of 25 years – carrying out difficult physical work 
for the benefit of her parents … on the strength of their repeated 
representations that she would eventually take over the farm and 
business.’

Lords Justice Richards, Underhill and Floyd will give their decision at a later date.
