A Ryanair pilot was forced to request police assistance after Danish workers surrounded the carrier’s first flight from Copenhagen to Dublin and prevented it from leaving, said airport officials.

Passengers and crew were stranded for three hours as dozens of employees held a protest over Ryanair’s refusal to enter into a collective bargaining agreement with a union for pilot and flight attendants.

Up to 60 employees, who demonstrated within Copenhagen Airport’s security perimeter, blocked the plane near one of the gates and prevented it from refuelling.

Demonstrators put duct tape over their mouths and urged Ryanair workers to 'break the silence'

Inside the terminal, demonstrators put duct tape over their mouths and held signs reading ‘Ryanair colleagues, break the silence, we have freedom to talk about our jobs’.

Copenhagen Airports spokesman Soeren Nielsen told MailOnline Travel that the pilot asked airport officials to call police

He said: ‘We requested the police assistance on behalf of the Ryanair pilot … because there was a breach of safety rules and regulations.

‘We were in constant dialogue [with the pilot] throughout the three hours that the aircraft was here at the airport.’

Police responded to the airport and allowed the group to continue its protest.

Deputy police inspector James Keiwe told Danish news agency Ritzau: ‘We have asked them to consider leaving the site and resolve the conflict in a different way. They were going to think about it.

Outside the terminal employees blocked Ryanair's first flight from Copenhagen to Dublin

‘We are very tolerant and patient at the Copenhagen police, so they must be given time for that.’ 

The protest came to an end about three hours later as the workers, who waved Danish flags, voluntarily dispersed.

Ryanair said the protest was carried out by ‘non-Ryanair individuals’ and called on Danish authorities to prevent a repeat of the ‘unlawful blockade’.

Protesters are upset that Ryanair is treating its Danish employees under Irish employment rules

Unrest has been building since October when Ryanair announced that it would be flying between Copenhagen and Dublin, London, Warsaw and Milan under Irish employment rules.

Trade unions have taken legal action in a bid to force Ryanair to treat its workers at Copenhagen Airport under Denmark’s generous employment rules.

Ryanair is planning to push ahead with plans for its Copenhagen base, although a ruling next week could lead to more demonstrations and further disruptions for the Dublin-based carrier.

A Ryanair spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel: ‘This Ryanair flight from Copenhagen to Dublin was subjected to an unlawful blockade by non-Ryanair individuals at Copenhagen Airport and its departure was delayed by three hours.

‘We call on the relevant authorities to take all necessary action to prevent any repeat of this unlawful blockade and we remain committed to growing jobs, routes and tourism in Denmark, with the opening of our new Copenhagen base next week.’
