Rangers fans will only be able to buy tickets for their forthcoming trip to Raith Rovers direct from the Kirkcaldy club — amid fears the stricken Glasgow giants could soon slide into insolvency again.

In normal circumstances, Rovers would hand the Ibrox outfit a substantial allocation of briefs which Rangers would then sell on to their own fans before reimbursing the Fifers at a later date.

However, it’s understood the Stark’s Park club have been concerned by suggestions of another financial collapse at Ibrox and that Rangers may not be in a position to fulfil their obligations.

Mike Ashley's plans to increase lending from £10m to £13m have been met with opposition by Ibrox support

Rangers are currently in discussions with Raith Rovers over ticket sales for the upcoming league match  

Rangers are said to need £6.5 million just to see them through until the summer and, as things stand, are in no position to meet next Thursday’s payroll obligations.

The club required an emergency loan of £500,000 from director Sandy Easdale to avoid being wound-up by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) earlier this month, although this has since been paid back from the funds raised by selling Lewis Macleod to Brentford.

Plans by Mike Ashley to increase his lending by £10m to £13m have been strongly resisted by the Ibrox support, with the Newcastle owner seeking security over Ibrox and Murray Park.

And, with no obvious solution to the growing financial crisis at Ibrox, Rovers have moved to insulate themselves ahead of the clash on February 20 by ensuring the proceeds from ticket sales goes straight into their hands. Briefs will go on sale at Stark’s Park on Tuesday, January 27.

Ashley wants to use the Ibrox Stadium and club's training ground as security against his loan

A Rangers spokesperson said on Wednesday: ‘The club are currently in discussions with Raith Rovers on this matter.’

Meanwhile, the Rangers Fans Fighting Fund will back The Rangers Supporters Trust with hard cash if need be in their bid to keep Ibrox out of Ashley’s clutches.

A spokesman for the group said: ‘The Rangers Fans Fighting Fund was launched by Ibrox legends Walter Smith and Sandy Jardine in 2012 to help safeguard and protect the club’s future and assets.

‘In recent days it has become crystal clear that the club’s current board is considering the use of Ibrox Stadium and Murray Park in order to secure a further loan from Mike Ashley.

‘Mr Ashley already has security over Edmiston House and the Albion Car Park and the RFFF, like almost all Rangers supporters, feels securitising our historic stadium and training ground is a step too far.

‘Ibrox, in our view, is sacrosanct. It is a memorial to the 66 who lost their lives (in the Ibrox Disaster).

Rangers First supporters group protest in the hope of saving the future of their club

‘Some of the greatest names in Scottish football history have graced the hallowed turf down the years and it should never be used as collateral in order to secure a loan that is not in the best interests of the club.

‘For that reason, the RFFF confirms it is willing to provide support and assistance to any fan group determined to protect the club’s assets.

‘We enjoyed a positive meeting with representatives from the Rangers Supporters Trust yesterday and we have agreed to back their initiative to prevent the securitisation of Ibrox and Murray Park.’

A statement on the RST website expressed its delight and gratitude to the RFFF’s backing and vowed: ‘We will work closely with the RFFF going forward to ensure every avenue is explored. The RST is not taking this action for the benefit of only its own members but for every Rangers fan and fan group.

Former Rangers director Paul Murray is another person to have put his support behind the scheme

‘Derek Llambias, Barry Leach, David Somers and James Easdale should be under no illusions that we will examine every available legal remedy to stop them passing our club’s assets to Mr Ashley.’

On Wednesday, Sandy and James Easdale responded to oldco director Paul Murray’s assertion that their days are numbered as he, too, pledged his support to the RST and Rangers First groups.

A statement released on behalf of the Rangers football board chairman and director said: ‘So, like an episode of The Living Dead, Paul Murray emerges from his borders lair having vowed never to return. He says he expects a smear campaign against himself and Dave King and in the same breath compares the Rangers board to Gerald Ratner. Hypocritical? You decide.

‘If Mr Murray and Mr King ever do get anywhere near the club they are welcome to carry out a robust financial investigation. The Easdale brothers have never taken a penny from the club and nor have they claimed any expenses. ‘One begins to wonder if we are not dealing with Paul McKenna as opposed to Paul Murray who appears to have hypnotised himself and his cohorts into obliterating the memory fact that they sold their beloved club for One Pound. Rangers men? You decide.’
