The boss of a counterfeit clothing empire nicknamed 'Loadsamoney' has been jailed after police found this incriminating picture of him waving a wad of cash worth £20,000 - just like the Harry Enfield comedy character.

Mohammed Basit Chaudhry, 26, posed for the shot resembling the cockney plasterer, played by Harry Enfield in the 1980s, while holidaying in Dubai on the spoils of his family's counterfeit racket.

But officers found the photo on Chaudhry's mobile phone after they raided his recently renovated £200,000 semi-detached family home in Chorlton, Manchester, where he lived with his brother and parents.

The photo showed Chaudhry in a shiny striped designer hooded tracksuit type jacket, baseball cap with a Dolce & Gabbana bag and sporting a huge smile as he waved his giant wad of £10 notes at the camera.

An investigation revealed the Chaudhrys - who wore expensive clothing, designer watches and holidayed in exotic locations - had their home lavishly furnished using cash from their ill-gotten gains.

Officers recovered counterfeit clothing worth £250,000 and more than seven kilograms of cannabis with a street value of around £70,000.

At Manchester Crown Court, Basit, who ran clothing firm Gino Trading, was jailed for three years and four months after he pleaded guilty to possessing class B drugs with intent to supply and money laundering.

Brother: Mohammed Kamran Chaudhry leaving Manchester Crown Court where he was jailed for two years

His bankrupt brother Mohammed Kamran 
Chaudhry, 30, was jailed for two years after admitting conspiracy to 
sell counterfeit goods and money laundering.

Their businessman father Abdul Hamid 
Chaudhry, 59, of Chatburn Road, Chorlton was jailed for 20 months after 
he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell counterfeit goods and money 
laundering.

While their mother Shahnuz Akhtar Chaudhry, 57, was jailed for ten weeks after admitting mortgage fraud.

Raided: The family home in Chorlton, Manchester, where Mohammed Basit Chaudhry lived with his parents

The
family's crime empire was shattered after a two year investigation by 
the police during which numerous raids were carried out at the family 
home between 2009 and 2011.

Detective Inspector Chris Mossop, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The Chaudhry empire was a vast operation that netted them untold profits.

'They lived lavish lifestyles off the back of it while many people have been struggling to make ends meet in difficult financial times.

'They may have briefly enjoyed the trappings of so-called success, such as expensive watches and luxury holidays, but they are all distant memories to them now as they languish in jail.

'I hope today's sentence reminds people that we will not rest until we have brought criminals to justice, no matter how sophisticated or successful you think you are.'

In February 2009, officers seize more than £26,000 and almost five kilograms of Lidocaine, a cutting agent for cocaine, at the family home in Chorlton, Manchester.

More raids take place in January 2010 at clothing firms owned by Abdul Hamid Chaudhry where police uncover seven kilograms of cannabis.

In the business premises of Abdul's firm Merit Smart, boxes of counterfeit clothing were found and a computer was seized which showed recent searches related to drug supply and importation.

Police seize a counter surveillance scanner, phones and a camera on May 14 at the family home which are taken away to be examined.

They discover a photograph on one of the phones showing a large cannabis cultivation and photographs of the family holidaying in Dubai and Pakistan. 

A raid at a different address uncovered a quantity of cannabis along with high value watches. 

On June 8 2011, 42 cartons of GHD gift sets are seized worth approximately £65,000. The paperwork also found is related to Gino Trading.

Police carry out a further eight raids on the same day in November 2011 across Chorlton, Prestwich, Stretford and Cheetham Hill and recover £15,000 in cash, a large amount of high value jewellery and another counter surveillance scanner. 

On Thursday February 11, 2012, Gino Trading is searched and three boxes of clothing is seized. 

The clothing within the boxes is examined by Trading Standards officers who confirm they were counterfeit goods. 

Merit Smart is raided once again and 190 boxes of counterfeit goods are found. A further search of Gino Trading is carried out and 120 boxes are seized.
