Ravel Morrison appears to be a step closer to securing a summer move to Lazio.

A team of agents flew to Rome on Friday to discuss a possible transfer for the out-of-favour West Ham United midfielder.

And reports in Italy now suggest a three-hour meeting with Lazio’s technical staff concluded in an offer of £500,000 a year plus bonuses for the 21-year-old.

Ravel Morrison has been offered a contract worth £500,000 a year by Italian club Lazio 

Morrison's only Premier League game for West Ham United this season was against Southampton in August

West Ham are allowing Morrison to leave Upton Park on a free after manager Sam Allardyce lost patience with one of England’s most talented but controversial footballers.

Here in England his representatives have told prospective employers he seeks only £15,000 a week - his current salary at West Ham  - and will even waive his right to any compensation should a club want to terminate his contract if he steps out of line.

But the Italians seem to be showing more interest than clubs in the Premier League, who see Morrison as a risk despite three assault charges against him being withdrawn at Manchester Crown Court earlier this week.
