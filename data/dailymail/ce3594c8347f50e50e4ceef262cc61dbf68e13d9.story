At first glance, it looks like Yaya Toure is pointing towards a Chelsea side disappearing into the distance with the Premier League title.

But while Manchester City continue to stumble in the title race without the presence of their star midfielder, the Ivory Coast powerhouse was instead preparing for his country's opening game of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.

The 31-year-old spent Monday looking around the Malabo Stadium and inspected the pitch ahead of his country's group stage encounter with Guinea on Tuesday.

The midfielder underwent a light training session but also posed for photographs with fans in scenes that looked more relaxed than the rough ride his City side are facing back in the Premier League.

Toure has missed City's last two games, which has seen the club draw 1-1 at Everton as well as lose 2-0 at home against Arsenal in the Premier League.

Having been neck-and-neck with Chelsea at the top of the table, City now trail the Blues by five points and look like they are badly missing Toure, who could be out of club action for a month should Ivory Coast reach the February 8 final.

Toure sat out of training on Saturday having suffered a minor injury scare but could still feature in the opening AFCON game for Ivory Coast.
