Louis van Gaal blamed the weather for an up and down Manchester United performance as they beat Roma 3-2 at Sports Authority Field.

United edged home thanks to two Wayne Rooney goals and a strike from Juan Mata in the first half.

But a 3-0 half-time lead almost disappeared as Roma came back at Van Gaal’s team and United were holding on at the end.

VIDEO Heat and altitude affected us - Van Gaal 

'We didn’t play a good match,' said Van Gaal. 'Maybe it was the altitude.

'All my passes fell today and that’s not normal. It was probably the air. The ball was bobbling but we scored remarkable goals. Fantastic.

'In the second half we didn’t keep the ball in possession. That’s all we had to do, to keep the ball and make the opponent run and run and run.

'It’s very difficult for them in the hot weather but we forgot to that so we brought Roma back in to the match. I am pleased we have won but it was no good.'

It was hovering around 30 degrees before a kick-off that took place at 2pm local time. Denver is also a mile above sea level and Van Gaal clearly has issues about United agreeing to come here.

'The club agreed it before I got here,' he said.

'I am not used to the hot weather. I was here in 1994 for the World Cup and games were played at noon. It’s not very wise.

'You have to play football at the right time. I’m sorry to say that. There were 55,000 people to watch us but we didn’t do it because of the weather.

'We have scored three fantastic goals and they scored one. Their penalty at the end was not right. But our system works. The players have adapted.

'I don’t want to make excuses but I don’t believe things would normally go wrong for players like Kagawa and Mata and Herrera.'

Asked about Rooney’s contribution, Van Gaal didn’t go in to detail. But he said: 'We don’t have to discuss one player. We will discuss the team.

'But the pass from Rooney to Mata was unbelievable. Despite the air and the heat!'

Roma’s first goal was scored from his own half by Bosnian midfielder Miralem Pjanic. Asked if goalkeeper Ben Amos was at fault, Van Gaal said: 'I am almost 63 years old. But when the ball is in the air for four or five seconds I could run 50 yards.'
