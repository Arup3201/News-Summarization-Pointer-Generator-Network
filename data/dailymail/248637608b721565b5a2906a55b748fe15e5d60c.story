A two-year-old boy who was left 
fighting for his life after a gust of wind from Hurricane Sandy caused a
tree limb to fall and hit his head has contracted a life-threatening 
illness while in hospital.

Tripp Halstead, from Georgia, has 
been hospitalized since the October 29 incident outside his daycare center after sustaining a brain
injury which left him in a medically induced coma.

But last week, as his treatment continued more than three months after the storm, he contracted bacterial meningitis, his mother said on Facebook.

Injuries: Tripp Halstead, who suffered head injuries in Hurricane Sandy, has now contracted bacterial meningitis

Battle: Tripp has been in hospital ever since the accident and contracted the condition during an emergency operation last week to remove a pump administering medicine to his brain

'Tripp has bacterial meningitis, which is
very life threatening,' Stacy Halstead wrote. 'Words can’t describe what we are feeling except 
total heartbreak.

'I have just been staring at that sweet little face. To think we had come so far, then to get the scare that he might have a life-threatening infection and we might lose him. Worst day to boot so far.'

She has previously spoken out about how she and her husband struggled to conceive their only son.

Bacterial meningitis usually affects brain trauma patients in intensive care, Dr. Bill Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told ABCNews.com.

It usually occurs when bacteria gets into fluid surrounding the brain and even when hospitals use clean equipment, there is always a risk the bacteria could be transferred, he explained.

Before the accident: Tripp, who was an energetic toddler, is now confined to his bed or a chair

Every time you breach the body's protective surface you run the risk of an infection getting from the outside in,' Schaffner said. 'The longer you’re in an intensive care unit, the higher the risk is.'

Tripp contracted the infection after he underwent an emergency surgery on Thursday to remove a pump that had been inserted into fluid around his brain to administer medication.

Schaffner said he expected the boy would receive antibiotics to fight the infection.

His mother added that her son is 'such a little trooper and hanging in there'.

Just days earlier, his family had taken to Facebook to ask the group's 238,000 followers to pray for Tripp as he underwent emergency surgery to remove the pump.

Heavy: A strong gust of wind ripped the branch from the tree before it landed on Tripp

Struggle: The youngster was rushed to hospital but had suffered severe damage to his head

On October 29, tragedy struck when the toddler was playing at around 11.30am outside the Cribs and Crayons day care center, CBS Atlanta reported. 

A
strong gust of wind caused a tree limb to fall, hitting the little boy 
in the neck and head. Employees from the center rushed to his aid and 
administered CPR, but the damage had been done.  

When he was rushed into Children’s 
Healthcare of Atlanta on the day of the incident, he had emergency 
surgery to relive swelling around his brain from where the branch struck him on the head.

A
family friend set up the Facebook group for Tripp's parents, Bill and 
Stacy, who have been posting updates on their son's condition and asking
people to pray and donate money for his recovery. 

The
family said they have been overwhelmed with support from thousands of 
well-wishers, many of them strangers who have heard about Tripp's plight
from media reports, according to Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Fighting for his life: Both sides of two-year-old Tripp Halstead's brain were injured when a large branch was blown off a tree and hit him in the head

Bubbly: Tripp was playing outside with his classmates when the branch came from nowhere and struck him down

Miracle baby: Tripp's parents Bill and Stacy said they struggled for some time before having their only son

After the accident, the toddler's father, Bill Halstead, wrote that doctors gave them sobering news.

'His
injury is across both sides of the brain which makes it much worse. It 
is still far too early to know what the outcome will be or what the 
lasting damage could be,' the message read.

'His swelling is back up and his 
drainage tube is having problems,' the post said in part. 'Sounds like 
today is going to be the most trying day so far so please continue to 
pray. We still need a miracle.'

Since the accident, the boy's family have been on a roller coaster ride, going from positive signs, like a brief reduction in pressure around his brain, to serious complications, among them problems with his breathing. 

On Friday afternoon, a desperate plea appeared on the family's Facebook page asking for prayers. 

'Please Please Please Pray for a miracle and if we can't have a miracle pray for the family to have the strength to cope with what lays ahead.'
