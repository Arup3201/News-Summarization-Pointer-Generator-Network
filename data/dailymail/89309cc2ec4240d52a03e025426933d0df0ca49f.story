A married couple  were paid £120,000 for four months hospital work just weeks after receiving £1million in taxpayer-funded redundancy payouts from the NHS, it was revealed today.

Chris Reed and Karen Straughair are at the centre of a national row over the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes  before walking straight into another role.

The managers earned £120,000 between them while in temporary management posts at hospitals in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

But it has emerged that just two months before starting in the city, they had received payments totalling £1million after their previous health service jobs in the North East were abolished.

Critics today called the salaries an 'outrageous example of the 'revolving-door' culture in the NHS' while a Leeds MP said it was 'entirely wrong'.

Family affair: Karen Straughair and husband Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust earning £120,000 - months after a combined £1m payoff

It came as MailOnline exclusively revealed today that the NHS is rehiring more than 50 staff a month who have been given redundancy pay-outs.

New figures show that in just eight months the number of managers who have returned after being paid off leapt by 10 per cent to 4,300. 

This latest case involving married Mr Reed and Ms Straughair came to work at Leeds' hospital trusts in June last 2013 after their previous roles, as chief executives at primary care trusts, disappeared due to NHS reforms in April last year.

Bosses had previously refused to say how much the couple had been paid while working for the trust as interim chief executive and recovery director.

But, it had been revealed that Mr Reed received £70,000, including pension entitlements, and Ms Straughair £50,000.

Both worked at Leeds hospitals between June and October last year. Previously it has been revealed that Ms Straughair was paid more than £605,000 in redundancy from her top job at NHS South of Tyne and Wear.

Mr Reed received more than £345,000 when NHS North of Tyne was wound up.

The pair came under criticism last years when news of their large redundancy packages came to light, critics said payouts should be capped and recouped when staff are reemployed soon after being let go.

On an online forum for an NHS trade publication, one critic at the time posted: 'Surely a relevant question is how come two former Chief Executives, effectively Mr and Mrs NHS Tyne and Wear can pocket hundreds of thousands in redundancy payments and then get relatively swiftly re-employed by the NHS on mega high salaries.' 

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing, but the case sparked national controversy when details first emerged last year - and the latest revelation has prompted further anger.

Dia Chakravarty, political director at the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another outrageous example of the 'revolving door' culture in the NHS, which hits taxpayers twice - once in the form of pay-offs and then again in the form of new salaries.

'This is exactly the sort of bad management and lack of foresight we simply cannot afford in the public sector, particularly at a time when hard-pressed families are having to budget to make ends meet.'

Last month the Government vowed to recoup similar 'golden goodbyes' paid to public sector workers earning more than £100,000 who return to the same part of the public sector within 12 nonths of taking redundancy.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt argues the NHS reforms have saved £1.5billion a year, despite thousands of people given payouts returning to work in the health service

Greg Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, said: 'We already know about the scandalous sum that this couple were paid from NHS budgets in redundancy, then came back into the NHS in similar positions, earning good salaries as well.

'That's entirely wrong and people will be rightly outraged at a time when the pressure on these budgets is huge.'

He said the situation 'must never be allowed to happen again' and he was glad the Government was legislating to prevent it.

A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said the couple were paid in line with the roles they were fulfilling.
