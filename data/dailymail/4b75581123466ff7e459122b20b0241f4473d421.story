Frenchmen and women are said to be among the unhappiest in Europe, and their president’s approval rating is embarrassingly low.

But they are fighting back with a surge in purchases for books about happiness - despite the country’s intellectuals insisting that its people should stick to their tune of melancholy.

The French will buy an estimated six million self-help books written by 700 different authors this year, and are said to be adopting a fondness for Pharrell Williams, singer of the hit single Happy.

Best-selling books include And Don’t Forget to be Happy by psychiatrist Christophe André and I’m Stopping Complaining, by consultant Christine Lewicki, reported The Times journalist Adam Sage.

Mother-of-three Mrs Lewicki, who now lives in Los Angeles, California, is campaigning against pessimism in France - and is pushing for her fellow nationals to say ‘thank you’ instead of moaning.

Economist Jacques Attali has written Become Yourself, urging the French to ‘take control over your own lives’ – and using artist Damien Hirst and chef Jamie Oliver as positive role models.

Another economist, Claudia Senik, said the French had been found to be 20 per cent less happy than their counterparts in other European countries.

She told The Times: ‘The French are in a spiral of self-fulfilling pessimism. They have a very high social ideal, which is unreal and unrealistic, and in fact this makes them unhappy.’

Last month, President Francois Hollande’s popularity hit a new low - with his 12 per cent approval rating the worst score for a French president in modern-day polling.

Mr Hollande failed to meet his goal of reversing the rise in unemployment by the end of 2013, and many commentators say he has no hope of being re-elected as president again in 2017.
