Health tracking apps and bands have many uses, but they’re limited because they still need you to enter your eating habits manually.

But, researchers are hoping to change this using a sensor, worn around the ear, that automatically tracks how much people eat.

Cameras fitted to the device also snap images of the food as it enters the mouth to determine calorie content and other nutrient information.

Called Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), the device lets wearers track eating habits. A sensor, worn around the ear (pictured) monitors movements of the jaw. It is activated by vibrations caused by chewing, and filters out movements made by talking. The camera captures images of food to estimate its calorie content

As well as being easier to track food intake, the sensor has the potential to be more accurate than current, manual entries, explained the researchers from the University of Alabama.

Called Automatic Ingestion Monitor, or AIM, its creators also claim it has potential to improve weight-loss, and help doctors discover eating patterns in overweight patients.

The sensor works by monitoring vibrations in the jaw, made when people chew and is so sophisticated, it can filter out other motions, including talking and yawning.

Earlier this year, researchers from Canada created a chin strap that harvests energy from jaw movements, including chewing and talking.

It is hoped the device could soon be used to power electronic devices, such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, and even phones.

The strap is made from a smart material known as PFC. PFC is a type of piezoelectric material made up of integrated electrodes, and an adhesive polymer matrix.

The material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches, and is subjected to mechanical stress.

Jaw movements proved to be one of the most promising candidates for generating electricity from human body movements, with researchers estimating that an average of around seven microwatts of power could be generated from chewing during meals alone.  

Pictures of the food and drink are compared to an online database, using image recognition, and compared against a list of nutritional information.

And, because the device is wearable, it could additionally double-up as a pedometer or activity tracker to compare exercise levels against calorie intake.

Dr. Edward Sazonov, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university: ‘Weight gain comes from an unbalance of the energy we take in versus the energy we expend.

‘We can estimate diet and nutrient intake, but the primary method is self-reporting. 

'The sensor could provide objective data, helping us better understand patterns of food intake associated with obesity and eating disorders.’

Already proven viable, further work is being carried out to update the device, make it smaller and more robust, and boost its accuracy.

Dr Sazonov intends to test the AIM’s accuracy as an alternative method to tracking energy use from water samples.

This current method measures the body’s elimination rate of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen added to the water, a process that can take two weeks.

The information can be used to estimate how many calories a person consumes over a period of time, but is expensive and requires medical expertise.

It’s likely AIM’s first application would be as a medical device, but Sazonov said it’s possible it could become a consumer device that would eliminate the need for health-conscious people to keep a record of their diet.
