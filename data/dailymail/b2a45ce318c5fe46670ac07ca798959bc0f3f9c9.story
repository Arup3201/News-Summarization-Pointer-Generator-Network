Cole, who spent eight years at Stamford Bridge after joining from Arsenal, had been linked with a return to north London while Liverpool was also touted as a possible destination.

Barcelona and AC Milan were also reported to be monitoring his situation.

Cole has had a holiday after retired from England duty on 107 caps when he was left out of Roy Hodgson's squad for Brazil. The manager selected Everton's Leighton Baines as his first-choice left-back and took Southampton teenager Luke Shaw as back-up.
