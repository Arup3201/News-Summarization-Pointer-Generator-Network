Officer Darren Wilson, the cop who shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August, has quietly gotten married. 

The 28-year-old officer, who hasn't been seen in public since the shooting, visited a St Louis County office last month to apply for a marriage license. 

Wilson then married Officer Barbara Spradling, 37, several days later on October 24 in front of his lawyer and a judge in Overland, Missouri.

A municipal judge performed the ceremony in Overland, Missouri. The marriage license was first published by the New York Times on Monday.

Records showed that Officer Wilson and his new wife had both been married before. Wilson's divorce came through on November 10, 2013. 

Wilson married his first wife Ashley Brown in Old Monroe, Missouri in October 2011 but divorced last year. They had no children.

The new Mr and Mrs Wilson already own a home together in Crestwood, Missouri. She had previously been named as his girlfriend prior to their wedding. 

The new bride also has not been seen since the August 9 shooting. 

Both Officer Wilson and Officer Spradling have received honors for their police work. 

She received a medal of valor award in 2012 for her work. Officer Wilson received a commendation earlier this year for his arrest of a suspect in a drug case.

Darren Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson on August 9. 

A grand jury deliberating over whether Wilson should be indicted in Brown's shooting death had reached a decision on Monda. 

Sources told The Washington Post that press conferences are being prepared by the county prosecutors’ office and the Missouri governor and expected to come later today - but no indication of the verdict was given. 

Law enforcement has dispatched hundreds of police armed with grenades, enlisted 100 FBI officers and erected barricades around Buzz Wesfall Justice Center ahead of the verdict following months of unrest and angry demonstrations following the shooting.

A lawyer for Michael Brown's family criticized how prosecutors have handled the grand jury process, which has dragged on longer than many expected.

The attorney, Benjamin Crump, told ABC's This Week program on Sunday it was the first time in his 20 years as an attorney that a prosecutor had not recommended charges to a grand jury hearing a case.

'Why you can't come in and recommend charges right now based on the probable cause?' Crump said, a reference to witnesses who said Brown had his hands up in the air, signaling surrender, when the officer shot him. Wilson's supporters say he shot Brown in self-defense.

St. Louis County prosecutors have said the grand jury's decision will be announced at a news conference, but the date, time and location remain unknown.

Crump said he expected to get about six hours notice before an announcement.

In anticipation of the announcement, barriers were erected over the weekend around the courthouse where the jury meets, and traffic restrictions were imposed on some nearby roads.  

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and called in National Guard troops to back up police, which protesters have criticized as heavy-handed.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told demonstrators on Saturday night they should remain peaceful whatever the grand jury decides. 

After a fourth straight night of low-level protests in Ferguson, Missouri, anxious residents still did not know on Sunday when a grand jury would return its decision
