A conman who convinced 138 people - including his own mother - to part with with a total of £6million in a football syndicate scam has been jailed.

Darren Thompson, 40, earned a six-figure salary as a chartered accountant in major city banks  before setting up the 'guaranteed' syndicate, which saw him persuade his own and his wife's relatives, friends and co-workers to plough in hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Thompson, who even produced a glossy brochure of fake information that promised 'big returns', was jailed for four years and eight months at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting fraud by false representation.

Fraudster: Darren Thompson, 40, was jailed for four years and eight months after admitting conning his friends and co-workers out of hundreds of thousands of pounds to join his 'guaranteed' football syndicate

Thompson's mother gave him £50,000 to put into the syndicate, while his wife Nina-Louise's family lost £300,000.

The former City worker earned £150,000 a year at banks including Barclays and Credit Suisse before establishing the European Football Growth Fund in 2004, the court heard.

Prosecutor Stuart Biggs told the court Thompson first started betting on Betfair in 2004 and thought he could 'play the system' to make big profits, but that as soon as the syndicate was set up he started losing heavily.

Martin Taylor, defending, said Thompson had no previous convictions and 
simply got carried away, believing he could claw back money with even 
bigger bets.

Mr Taylor told the court: 'He believed that these figures were predictable and it was not gambling.

'He had a system and did not consider himself to be a gambler as it was very much a situation where the risk was spread.'

Judge Heather Norton, jailing Thomspon for four years and eight months, 
told him: 'No doubt your investors were reassured by your background in 
football and investment and no doubt too by the glossy brochures which 
you provided.

'Unfortunately, indeed tragically as far as your investors were 
concerned, by the start of 2007 you could have been in no doubt at all 
that this scheme wasn't working.'

Thompson convinced ‘high 
roller’ colleagues in the City to part with anything from £30,000 to as 
much as £600,000 to join his ‘guaranteed’ football betting syndicate.

Thompson used dodgy bank statements which indicated the syndicate was making huge returns to help convince people to invest.

Proceeds: Thompson scam paid for a lavish Las Vegas wedding for him and wife Nina

But he was actually ‘useless’ at betting, losing between 73 and 91 per cent of all bets staked over a six year period between 2004-2010.

The court heard how Thompson had deposited £4.1million into various betting accounts between April 2004 and October 2010.

He lost £3million of that money and withdrew just over £1million. The remaining £2million he held back from the accounts, he spent, the court heard.

Despite his heavy losses, Thompson 
still managed to live a lavish lifestyle, paying for a Las Vegas wedding
to wife Nina-Louise and trips to South Africa and the United Arab 
Emirates.

He also accumulated a fleet of luxury cars including a Mercedes, a Jaguar, a Porsche and a 4x4.

Some
of his victims were forced to remortgage their homes to pay for the 
‘investment’, but were left with nothing after Thompson was snared.

One
‘investor’ lost a massive £600,000, but the average loss was around 
£40,000 among more than 100 people - most of them friends he met while 
working in London - duped by Thompson.

Officers
from the Serious and Organised Crime Unit at Kent Police confirmed the 
unit had identified 138 victims of the betting scam.

They
said Thompson ‘paid out’ to several investors in 2007, but only so they
would invest more and to give the impression ‘the betting syndicate was
doing well’.

Thompson 
pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation at Canterbury Crown 
Court and was jailed for four years and eight months yesterday.

Detective
Constable Stuart Champion said today: 'Thompson abused the trust placed
in him by some of his closest friends and investors.

'He
provided them with fake data and drew up complex documents such as a 
declaration of trust to win them over and convince them to put their 
money in.

Lies: Thompson enjoyed holidays to South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, and splashed out on a fleet of luxury cars

'Some of 
their money was invested into bets but they were never successful as 
Thompson never made a profit during the time he ran the syndicate.

'The
rest of the money was spent by Thompson on holidays, his wedding and 
expensive cars while some of his investors struggled to make ends meet 
as a result.

'This 
sentence brings to a close a very complex case and I’d like thank those 
who came forward and the evidence we found was so compelling that 
Thompson had no choice but to admit the fraud.'
