 

Michelle Meyers, 47, declined a blood alcohol content breath test and was arrested for DUI

A woman suspected of driving under the influence soiled herself after she was pulled over by a Florida deputy earlier this month.

Michelle Meyers, 47. was stopped in Jensen Beach by a Martin County Sheriff's deputy after he observed her SUV driving erratically.

The deputy requested to inspect her license and registration, then had to remind Meyers what he was hoping to see.

She fumbled around in her purse for a bit and eventually produced her license. 

Meyers, who smelled of alcohol, told the deputy she was headed home from work, 

He then asked her where she was employed, TCPalm reported.   

'God Almighty... I don't know,' Meyers reportedly replied.

'God Almighty, I only had two beers.'

After being asked to perform a field sobriety test, Meyers mentioned 'God Almighty' once again. 

'I assured Meyers that I was not God Almighty, and told her my name was Deputy Cuty,' according to an arrest affidavit written by the deputy. 

During a subsequent field sobriety test, Meyers told the deputy, 'I just pooped my pants.' 

Meyers, who declined a blood alcohol content breath test, was arrested on a charge of DUI.
