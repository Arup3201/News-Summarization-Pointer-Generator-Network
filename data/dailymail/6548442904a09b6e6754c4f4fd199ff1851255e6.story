Douglas Westcott, 55, is charged with possession of child pornography

Police in Florida found the bodies of some 50 dead cats — frozen in four separate freezers — inside the home of a man they were arresting for alleged child pornography on Wednesday.

Douglas Westcott, 55, was charged in Palm Beach County with three counts of possession of child porn. There were several pictures of naked juveniles inside his Lake Worth home, according to WBPF.

Deputies went to his house to haul him to jail when they found as many as 35 cats living in absolute squalor inside the filthy home, said Capt. David Walesky of the Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control, the Palm Beach Post reported.

Another 50 dead bodies were kept in frozen bags.

'The bodies are spread among 4 separate freezers, which of course is the most unusual aspect of this,' Walesky told USA Today.

Litter boxes overflowed with feces and urine. Officers had to wear masks to avoid the stench.

Some of the cats were healthy but many suffered from respiratory and skin problems, according to the Palm Beach Post.

'The living conditions were not acceptable for the animals,' Walesky told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

Westcott refused to hand over custody of the cats to animal control.

A judge will decide what to do with them in the next 30 days.

Horrified
 neighbors gathered outside the home to watch as cages upon cages of 
alive cats, as well as bags of frozen carcasses, were taken out one by 
one, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

'They're
 just coming from everywhere,' neighbor Lorraine Fenner told the 
newspaper. 'I had no idea there were so many in that house.'

Another
 neighbor, Marie Jean-Pierre, said Westcott has a wife and they have 
lived in the house for some 10 years, the Sun-Sentinel reported. 
Neighborhood kids called the place 'the cat house.'

'It's
 crazy,' Jean-Pierre told the Sun-Sentinel. 'I knew they had a lot of 
cats.

'They said the cats were like their kids. I don't know what to 
say.'

The home was so filthy, animal control officials had to wear masks to endure the stench of urine and feces inside the home
