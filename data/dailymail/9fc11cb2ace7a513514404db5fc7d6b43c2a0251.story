This is the image Iran is using to justify their detention of a London law graduate.  

Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, has been held in custody since June 30 for 'propaganda against the regime' after trying to watch a men's volleyball match, which women in Iran are banned from attending.

The group of fellow women's rights campaigners she was  with took this photograph when they were prevented from entering the Azadi stadium, in Tehran.

This is the photograph Iranian authorities claim justifies their detention of Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, (circled)

Miss Ghavami was questioned for four hours after being arrested for trying to enter the stadium in the Iranian capital. 

She had believed she could watch the match because reports had suggested the restriction on women mingling with male spectators at sports facilities had been relaxed. 

The 25-year-old graduate from SOAS, part of the University of London, was released but rearrested days later when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station and officers discovered dual citizenship.

Miss Ghavami was only told on September 23 that she was formally charged with ‘propaganda against the regime’ – a charge that carries a possible prison term of several years. Her case is due to be heard by Tehran’s notorious revolutionary court.

To mark 100 days since she was jailed, Miss Ghavami has now gone on a hunger strike.  

Miss Ghavami’s mother, Susan Moshtaghian, 49, told the Guardian that she too had gone on hunger strike and was increasingly worried about her daughter’s condition.

‘I am extremely concerned about Ghoncheh’s health and life. I hold [the] authorities fully responsible for any harm inflicted on my daughter,’ she said.

Ms Moshtaghian, from London, was allowed to visit her daughter for the first time in 19 days on Saturday.

‘She told me she has been on hunger strike since 1 October as objection to her uncertain conditions and 100 days of temporary custody with no basis,’ she said.

‘I am restless since I heard about this and I have also gone on hunger strike. I stayed silent for 82 days in the hope that my daughter comes back home safely.

'Now I am worried about her life and will not stop until she’s free.’

Miss Ghavami’s brother, Iman, 28, said his sister had lost weight since she has been imprisoned and was visibly thinner when her parents visited. He said he was 'extremely concerned' about her health. 

‘People die from hunger strike. It’s a very serious situation and it’s been five days now,’ he said. 

Since her arrest, the London graduate has been allowed minimal contact with her family. 

The law graduate from SOAS, part of the University of London, has been held for 100 days after being arrested in June for trying to watch a men’s sports game in Tehran which women in Iran are banned from attending

A petition started by Mr Ghavami on the site Change.org has so far collected more than 528,000 signatures.

David Cameron and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond have raised the matter with their Iranian counterparts. But as Iran does not recognise dual nationality, diplomatic efforts are limited.  

The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, was questioned about Miss Ghavami’s detention on Christiane Amanpour’s CNN show in September.

He said: ‘According to our laws [she is an Iranian citizen] only, we do not accept dual citizenship, but the bottom line is our aim is for the laws to be respected every step of the way.’

An FCO spokeswoman said: ‘We are concerned about the detention of Miss Ghoncheh Ghavami, a dual British-Iranian national in Iran. 

'We are in touch with her family. We have raised our concerns with the Iranian government and asked for more information about her welfare and the charges against her.'
