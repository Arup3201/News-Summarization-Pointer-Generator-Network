Yaasmeen Castanada, the California mom who suffered a toxic allergic reaction to a friend's medication that caused her to essentially burn from the inside out, has finally been allowed to go home after 52 days in intensive care.

The 19-year-old, who took the leftover prescriptions on Thanksgiving because she wasn't feeling well and was hospitalized hours later needing a ventilator to breath, was reunited with her family in Fresno, including her five-month-old daughter, on Wednesday, after checking out of the University of California Irvine's burn unit.

'She needs to be home with her family, her baby,' Castanada's mother, Laura Corona, told ABC News.

'I know she'll recover. She's really strong. She has a lot of will to live.'

Freak reaction: Yaasmeen took some medication from a friend believing it would make her better, completely unaware it would be toxic to her body

Reunion: The mom was allowed to return to her Fresno home and her baby daughter

Castanada  suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. 

Her body broke out in massive blisters as if she had been burned from head to toe.

'Her face changed within four days,' her mother told ABC. 

'I would wipe her face and all the skin was just falling off.'

More than 90 percent of Castanada's body is still affected.

She recently had a tube put in her trachea to her breath because her throat was closing.

Yaasmeen suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome after taking antibiotics on Thanksgiving Day because she was feeling sick

Patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome aren't technically burned.

The condition compromises their skin barrier function, inflammation and blistering to occur on the outer layer of skin as well as the lips, eyes and genitals.

Patients therefore need to be treated as burns victims.

And as with burns victims, there is a serious risk of the wounds becoming infected.

Castanada suffered a blood infection, a urine infection and an infection in her throat, according to ABC. 

Blisters: She will need physical, occupational, optical, dermatology, nutrition and burn therapy

Traumatic: She suffered burning in her throat, eyes and mouth. Her eyes became bloodshot and her lips were tearing off

Diagnosis: When she was rushed to the ER, she was told that she had a rare but very serious allergic reaction to antibiotics called Stevens-Johnson syndrome that causes you to blister

Overcome: Yaasmeen's mother, Laura Corona, becomes emotional while explaining he daughters' condition

Unwell: Yaasmeen was feeling a little under the weather and so took her friend's antibiotics

'Heartbreaking, just unreal,' her mother told ABC.

'Just watching your daughter burn in front of you, literally burn in front of you.' 

Yaasmeen took the medication believing it would make her better, completely unaware it would be toxic to her body.

She initially suffered burning in her throat, eyes and mouth.

Her eyes then became bloodshot and her lips were tearing off. 

'It can be considered a burn from the inside out because of mucosal involvement,' said dermatologist Dr. Lawrence Matt. 

'First of all, don't share medication, don't give someone else your medication, don't offer medication,' she said. '

Another thing also, go get yourself checked out and your kids checked out (for allergies), because you don't know what you're allergic to.'

She will need physical, occupational, optical, dermatology, nutrition and burn therapy.
