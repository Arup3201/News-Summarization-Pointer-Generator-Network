Revenge? Ann Curry, pictured at industry awards last month, could be on the move to CNN, according to sources

Ann Curry could yet have her revenge on NBC by joining CNN as an evening anchor, according to reports.

The former Today show host is expected to be approached by CNN boss Jeff Zucker to head up its 8pm show as she is the perfect ‘smarty pants foreign affairs type’ that he wants.

Anderson Cooper, whose 360 show currently has that slot, will likely be moved to a later time to take on a Christiane Amanpour-correspondent style role.

According to the New York Post, Zucker is looking to capitalize on the public sympathy for the way Curry’s exit from Today was handled.

During
her on-air farewell in June - after just a year in the job - she 
apologized for ‘dropping the ball’ and wept as she said she let the side
down.

Critics 
said that she had been hung out to dry and in an interview, Curry claimed that bosses fired her because they did not like her 
fashion sense and her refusal to wear high heels.

A source told the Post: ‘Jeff wants a headliner like Rachel Maddow or Bill O’Reilly in prime time.

‘He
cannot allow the low ratings at CNN to continue... so he can’t hire a 
nobody.

'Curry fits that CNN-smarty-pants-foreign-affairs type.'

Curry was vindicated when summer ratings at Today dropped seven per cent following her departure.

In the ten weeks before Curry left, the Today show had 4.94 million viewers but in the ten weeks after, there were 4.6 million.

On the move? There is speculation that Erin Burnett (left) and Anderson Cooper could be given new roles during a reshuffle at CNN

She has remained with NBC on her $10million-a-year contract and returned to foreign reporting but Today has stumbled since the arrival of her replacement Savannah Guthrie.

According to reports, the show's anchor Matt Lauer has been ‘obsessively’ watching rival show Good Morning America on ABC as he frets about his own future.

The Today executive who fired Curry, Jim Bell, also left his post after seven years in charge of the show.

Today is also now being beaten by GMA which ended Today’s 16-year run as the number one breakfast programme.

The speculation about Zucker's shake-up comes after reports that Erin Burnett could be teamed with a male presenter to front a new morning show.

Piers Morgan’s talk show may also be moved to a later slot as part of reshuffling at the network.

Were Anderson Cooper to be moved to a later slot, it would be another setback to him after his talk show was cancelled after just two seasons due to poor viewing figures.

He has acknowledged that things may change for him and in an interview said that ‘it’s in the slower times that we’ve run into problems, and I hope we figure it all out'.

Zucker was appointed as the new boss of CNN after it saw ratings plunge to near record lows.

In April the network posted its worst month since 2001 with an average of just 357,000 viewers, a drop of 21 per cent on the previous year.

The slump was even higher among the coveted 25-54 bracket where 29 per cent fewer people tuned in.

A CNN spokesman said: ‘There is no shortage of rumors about what Jeff will do. He doesn’t start until late January and any speculation at this point is just silly.’

An NBC spokesman added: ‘Ann Curry is under contract with NBC News.
