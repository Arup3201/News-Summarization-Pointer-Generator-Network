The mother of a beloved math teacher who was allegedly killed by a 14-year-old student sobbed as she left her daughter's funeral on Monday, her face etched with agony.

Peggie Ritzer left St Augustine Church in Andover, Massachusetts supported by her son, Daniel, this morning as more than 1,000 mourners gathered to pay their respects to her daughter Colleen.

Ms Ritzer, 24, was found killed last Tuesday in a wooded area behind Danvers High School, where she had inspired students for two years and gained a glowing reputation.

Among the massive crowds outside her funeral today were around 400 students from the school.

They looked on somberly as Ritzer's family - including her father Tom and sister Laura - left the church behind the casket.

In a eulogy at the funeral, one of her cousins, Gina McDaniel, described Ritzer's love for education.

'Colleen's passion in life was to be a teacher,' McDaniel said, the Boston Globe reported.

She was a 'bright light in our lives who just wanted to make this world a better place by focusing on the adults of the future.'

She
 spoke of how her cousin's inspiring energy and intelligence that 
touched everyone she met and that she made them feel 'loved, comforted 
and optimistic'.

'In such a short period of time, one person has made a world of difference,' she said, adding a summary of Ritzer's life: 'A heart so big, God couldn't let it live.'

'There's going to be a void forever in our hearts. I don't know that anything can ever fill that.'

At
 the viewing on Sunday, Ritzer's very first teacher, Laura Fogarty, said
 that the murder and loss of the much-loved teacher and friend had 
shocked the community.

'This has rocked me to the core, 
because of how pure, innocent and beautiful she was, she just deserved 
the best the world had to offer and she got the worst,' Fogarty said.

Of
 meeting her for the first time, she said: 'I bonded and fell in love 
with her instantly. I was fresh out of college, it was my first teaching
 experience, and I fell in love with her. She was my Colleen.'

Fourteen-year-old Philip Chism has been charged with murder in her death and is being tried as an adult. He has pleaded not guilty.

Police said he killed her in a school bathroom after classes finished on Tuesday. She was reportedly punched in the face and slashed with a box cutter before Chism put her body in a recycling bin and took her to the woods.

A statement released by Chism's public defender said the teen's mother, Diana Chism, is heartbroken for Ritzer's family.

'She asks that you know that she cares for the world's hurt over this and greatly hopes for your prayers for the Ritzer family, the Danvers community, for her son, and all those affected by this tragedy,' the statement said.

Philip Chism was arrested early Wednesday walking along a road in a nearby town.

Ritzer's family has established a memorial scholarship fund to benefit Andover High School graduates who also pursue teaching careers.
