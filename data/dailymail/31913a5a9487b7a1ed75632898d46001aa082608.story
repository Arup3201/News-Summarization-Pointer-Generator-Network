David Cameron said the Labour leader needed to tell middle earners which taxes he was planning

David Cameron today sparked a furious row with Labour after accusing Ed Miliband of planning a series of tax rises on the middle classes.

The Prime Minister said the party's deputy leader Harriet Harman had called on middle earners to 'contribute more' in taxes - pointing to remarks she made in a radio interview.

But Labour accuse Mr Cameron of 'lying' and claimed Miss Harman was merely defending the current situation in which the middle classes pay more in tax than the poor.

During a fiery Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon, Mr Cameron said: 'Labour would put a tax on you jobs, on your mortgage, on your home and on your pension.' 

He said Miss Harman's remarks showed Labour had a 'big tax problem'.

Mr Cameron added: 'The Deputy leader of the Labour party on the radio said this: "I think people on middle incomes should contribute more through their taxes." That is what she said.

'That is their policy, the squeezed middle will be squeezed more. Now he needs to tell us which people are going to pay which taxes.

'Because on this side of the House we've cut council tax, we've cut petrol duty, we've cut the jobs tax, we've increased the marriage couple's allowance.'

He added: 'Tell us where are the middle income taxes coming.' 

Middle earners in Britain £26,000 a year - with the average family income is £32,600.

Mr Miliband dismissed Mr Cameron's accusations as 'totally desperate'. The Labour leader added: 'He has nothing to say about the cost of living crisis.' 

He also accused the Prime Minister of overseeing the worst squeeze on living standards in history.

It came after figures revealed this morning that pay had gone up by just 0.3 per cent in the year to May - far below inflation at 1.9 per cent.

Following the row in the Commons today, Miss Harman wrote to the Prime Minister, accusing him of misrepresenting her comments.

She said: 'You claimed at Prime Minister's Questions today that "yesterday Labour announced - in an important announcement - that it is now their policy to put up taxes on middle income people." This is not true. It is a lie.'

Miss Harman's remarks came on her monthly radio phone in on LBC.

Ed Miliband said the Prime Minister's remarks were 'desperate'. Mr Miliband said: 'He has nothing to say about the cost of living crisis.'

She was asked by a called what Labour were going to do 'to help the middle classes'.

Miss Harman said: 'I would say Henry one of the things that I would argue that should probably make a really big difference to you is having a really good health service. Because you don’t want to have to pay for health insurance.

'You don’t want to have to pay to go private to get really good healthcare system.

'And I think that is not just for working class people it’s for middle class people as well. And the same with education, you know, really good school system that helps people from lower income families and middle income families as well so I think that actually the idea that there are some things that help people on low incomes and other that help people on middle incomes.'

She then added: 'Yes I think people on middle incomes should contribute more through their taxes. But actually they need those public services like the transport system.'
