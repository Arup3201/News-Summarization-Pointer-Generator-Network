Simon Mignolet summed it up for Liverpool. The goalkeeper, widely derided earlier this season, has been part of a major turnaround in the fortunes of the club, sparked by losing to Manchester United in December.

After Liverpool’s 1-0 win at Swansea on Monday, Mignolet hailed the fighting spirit of the side and welcomed the prospect of facing United in the Barclays Premier League at Anfield on Sunday.

‘We know there will be a huge build-up,’ he said. ‘But as professional football players we can’t get carried away. We have a good squad who are willing to fight for each other. We work hard and sometimes it is even more satisfying to get the three points in that way.’

Liverpool are unbeaten in 2015 and are aiming for second place in the table after their upturn in form since December. In fact, they have already won as many league games this year (eight) as they did in the first half of the season, despite having played nine games fewer.

They have also picked up more Premier League points since Boxing Day (32) than Merseyside rivals Everton have all season (31) and Monday’s win came courtesy of their sixth successive away clean sheet in the league.

Their amazing form has seen them cut the gap to second-placed Manchester City from 17 points to four. Brendan Rodgers’ side remain the only unbeaten team in the top four English tiers in 2015. And in their past six matches they have picked up an average of 2.67 points per game, despite facing three of the current top seven teams.
