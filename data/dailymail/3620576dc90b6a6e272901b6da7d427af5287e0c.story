A 49-year-old man who exposed himself on a plane after rubbing burning 'peppermint oil' on his penis was cleared of indecent exposure yesterday.

A judge ruled there was insufficient proof that Utah's Stuart Ronald Clarke meant to break the law when he publicly played with his privates in November.

The FBI's Terrorism Taskforce began investigating Clarke after a woman who saw him  'holding his exposed penis in his right hand' during a Delta flight reported him to police.

Out there: Stuart Ronald Clarke, 49 (not pictured) was on a Delta Air Lines 
flight from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Salt Lake City, Utah when he 
exposed his penis

The woman also told a flight attendant after confronting Clarke.

The embarrassed man fled the Salt Lake City International Airport, leaving his bags behind, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.

Two days later, police questioned Clarke at his Provo home after seizing his luggage.

Clarke told police that he had a headache in Amsterdam, where the first leg of his trip originated.

To ease the pain, he rubbed what he called 'peppermint oil' on his forehead.

After landing in Minneapolis about eight hours later, Clarke boarded a second plane - this one going to Salt Lake City.

During the flight, he went to the bathroom, telling police he 'obviously touched [his] privates'.

He indicated that's when he inadvertently transferred the oil to his privates 'because he felt burning afterward.'

When he returned to his seat, he placed 
his coat over himself to 'keep warm' and began 'scratching and 
adjusting' his groin area because of his discomfort.

Airport police were unable to locate Clarke after the incident because he left the airport without even stopping to pick up his checked bag, according to a search warrant

He was sitting in a middle seat between two women.

When an officer asked why he didn't use the bathroom to relieve himself, he stated that it 'would not have made it better' because 'water makes it worse.'

Clarke said he then unbuttoned his pants, stuffed his right hand into his underwear and pulled out his penis. 

A police search of Clarke's luggage turned up a random mix of food and candies as well as two small boxes labeled 'Olbas Oil.'

One box stated the oil was an inhalant and decongestant, while the other said it could be used as a pain reliever when applied directly to the skin. 

Officers who opened the boxes reported the oil smelled of eucalyptus and mint. 

Clarke was charged in a federal court in April with lewd, indecent or obscene behavior on an aircraft, a class C misdemeanor.
