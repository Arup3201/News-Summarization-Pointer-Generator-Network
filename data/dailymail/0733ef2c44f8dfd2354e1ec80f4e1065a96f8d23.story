The final plans for the observation deck atop New York's One World Trade Center are set to be approved on Wednesday with a New York-based company owned by the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Yankees revealed as its chosen operator.

Legends Hospitality LLC has been 
selected to run the $62 million observation deck that will host an 
estimated 3.8 million annual visitors at the tallest structure in the 
western Hemisphere upon its completion in 2014.

Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey announced their choice of Legends on Tuesday with the land owned by the Port Authorities of both New York and New Jersey.

Future: An artist's rendering of the One World Trade Center's observatory, scheduled to open in 2015, is seen here showing the entrance to one of its interactive exhibits

Inside: The estimated 3.8 million annual visitors will walk through an interactive gallery, as depicted here, telling the stories of both New York City and One World Trade Center

When completed the observation deck, 
slated to open in 2015, will provide 
visitors an airview from 1,250 feet (381 meters) with an elevator 
sweeping guests through the 104 stories in 60 secondsâ€™ time.

Inside visitors will face interactive displays capturing the story of both New York City and One World Trade Center, according to Legends' submitted design.

A glass-walled dining room will also provide guests with surrounding birds-eye views of both New York and New Jersey.

As part of Legends' 15-year lease they are projected to provide $875 
million in rent revenue to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, according to a statement from Cuomo
and Christie on Tuesday.

Views: Visitors will be subjected to views of both New York City and New Jersey while 1,250-feet over lower Manhattan

Dining room: A restaurant will additionally provide guests to take in the 360-degree views with every comfort provided

Story to tell: The building, One World Trade Center that's due to open in 2014, is part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site in downtown Manhattan that was the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks

Profit: Legends is projected to provide $875 million in rent revenue to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey over the term of its 15-year lease atop the 104 story, pictured earlier this month

It was the largest amount of any of the submitted bids according to the New York governor's office.

'People
from around the world have watched as One World Trade Center is poised 
to once again become the anchor of Lower Manhattan,' said New Jersey 
Gov. Chris Christie.

'Tourism has been the backbone of our bistate region for many generations, and this observatory will be among our region's premier attractions that will draw tourists from around the world who want to experience the best that our bistate region has to offer.'

One World Trade Center, due to open 
in 2014, is part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site in 
downtown Manhattan that was the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

In addition to the two sports teams, Legends is owned by Checketts Partners Investment Fund, which was founded by David Checketts, a former president and chief executive of Madison Square Garden.

The selection of Legends is subject to approval by the Port Authority's board at its monthly meeting on Wednesday.

'Today's
announcement builds on the tremendous progress we have made at the 
World Trade Center site over the past couple of years and marks the 
continued rebirth of Lower Manhattan,' New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said 
in a statement.

'The observation deck will add hundreds of jobs in New York and add to the resurgence of the state's economy.'

The redeveloped World Trade Center site will include a memorial, a transit hub, a performing arts center, and four office towers.
