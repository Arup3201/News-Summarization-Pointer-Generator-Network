An 11-year-old Ohio girl has been taken into custody and is being held at a juvenile detention center in connection with the death of a two-month-old infant. 

Zuri Whitehead was being watched by her mother's friend at a home in Wickliffe, Ohio, on Friday. 

The babysitter, who also had her 11- year-old daughter at the home, called 911 because Zuri was 'in distress' and having trouble breathing.

She also told the dispatcher Zuri was in her daughter's bed at the time of the incident. 

Zuri was taken to Lake West Hospital and later transferred by medical helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, where she died.
