A jilted groom who raffled off his honeymoon 'plus one' to a total stranger is back in the UK and sharing his snaps of the paradise getaway.

John Whitbread, 32, from Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, only met his pretty blonde travelling companion at the airport before the seven-hour flight, after raffling the spare ticket to his dream honeymoon after his fiancée left him.

Now John has shared his pictures of his 'whirlwind adventure' in the Dominican Republic with Kelly Wood, 36, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, in which the duo cavort in a pool and pose on the beach.

And although the pair spent their days lazing by the pool and sipping cocktails, they insist they just became very good friends.

John said: 'We had such an amazing time on holiday.

'We had a great laugh and did some amazing things together - Kelly was a great person to go on holiday with.

'It's been a whirlwind adventure, which is exactly what we both wanted, and all the money raised went to charity which was great.'

He added: 'It was never really about romance, as I'd just come out of a relationship. But it was lovely to make a great friend, and for that I'm really grateful.

'You hear of people going on holiday with their best mates and falling out, so it's amazing that I managed to become friends with a total stranger. It's sad to think it's all over.'

Despite meeting for the first time at the airport, John spent two weeks in paradise in the Dominican Republic with Kelly, 36, the lucky winner

Appearing on Good Morning Britain today John admitted that the exotic holiday was also tinged with sadness.

'It was my honeymoon at the end of the day, I never did the sob story so it was actually a bit of a tough time for me as well,' he said.

'Kelly was good, she let me have my moments here and there so it was never about that.'

Kelly told presenters Susanna Reid and John Stapleton: 'I didn't obviously want to talk about it too much, I thought if John wants to bring it up, then he'll bring it up but I wasn't going to press for information or anything like that.

'I wanted to have a good time, I wanted John to have a good time… but I could see at times he was thinking about where he should have been.'

John added gratefully, 'She took my mind off things as well.'

Kelly spotted John's story after watching him being interviewed on TV.

John had initially planned to sell the spare ticket on Ebay, but after the highest bids were revealed to be fakes, he opted to raffle the ticket off instead, raising £1,410 for testicular cancer charity Balls To Cancer. 

Determined Kelly, who had originally bid £2,500 on Ebay, bought herself five £10 tickets, and hoped for the best.

Kelly said: 'When I saw John on the television, I thought he seemed really genuine. I thought what he was doing was amazing, and I wanted to get involved.

'I was stuck in a bit of a rut at the time - I hadn't gone on holiday for ages, and I'd been single for a while - so I couldn't see why not.

'I wanted an adventure and this seemed perfect.

'The day of the raffle I was really nervous but so excited, I really wanted to win. When I finally found out I was going I couldn't believe it, it was really overwhelming.

'When I told my friends and family they were all really excited for me.'

The pair then met for the very first time on the morning before their seven-hour flight.

John said: 'We had spoken over the phone and via email, but we only properly met on the day we went.

John said: 'We had spoken over the phone and via email, but we only properly met on the day we went.

'It was weird meeting Kelly at the airport, we were both a bag of nerves, but we hit it off.

'It could have easily gone the other way, but there were no awkward silences. Everything went really smoothly.'

But despite followers of their story hoping for romance, John and Kelly insist that they are just good friends.

Kelly said: 'It would have been nice to meet someone, but it was never really about romance for me. John had just split up with his partner, so it wasn't really the aim of the holiday.

'You could tell at times that it must have been hard for him - there were a lot of couples at the resort, and after all we were on the honeymoon he should have been sharing with his wife.

'But if he ever had a quiet moment he was back to his bubbly self in no time.'

Now the pair look back on their holiday with fond memories, and hope to remain great friends.

Kelly said: 'It's been a crazy ride but I've loved every minute.

'Now when people what the most outrageous thing I've ever done is, I won't have to sit with a blank expression on my face.

'It'll be a great story to tell the grandchildren.'
