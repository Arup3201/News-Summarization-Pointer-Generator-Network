In a video recorded just before he attacked, the gunman who killed a Canadian soldier and then stormed Parliament said he did it because of Canada's military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In a cellphone video, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau said his attack was 'in retaliation for Afghanistan and because [Prime Minister Stephen] Harper wants to send his troops to Iraq'.

The 32-year-old Canadian made the video in his car just before last October's attack in Ottawa.

In the video he made, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau said he opened fire in retaliation for Afghanistan and Iraq

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, killed a man and opened fire on Parliament before he was gunned down himself in Ottawa 

RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said he believes Zehaf-Bibeau (pictured both) was influenced by others

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police released the transcript from the video today. 

Police edited out the first 13 and last five seconds of the video for operational reasons.

The edited sections were not included in the transcript. 

Releasing the entire video would have hurt the investigation, according to police. 

To those who are involved and listen to this movie, this is
in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper wants to send
his troops to Iraq.

So we are retaliating, the Mujahedin of this world.
Canada's officially become one of our enemies by fighting and
bombing us and creating a lot of terror in our countries and
killing us and killing our innocents. So, just aiming to hit
some soldiers just to show that you're not even safe in your own
land, and you gotta be careful.

So, may Allah accept from us. It's a disgrace you guys have
forgotten God and have you let every indecency and things
running your land. We don't, we don't go for this. We are good
people, righteous people, believers of God and believing his law
and his Prophets, peace be upon them all. That's my message to
all of you in this, Inshallah, we'll not cease until you guys
decide to be a peaceful country and stay to your own and I-, and
stop going to other countries and stop occupying and killing the
righteous of us who are trying to bring back religious law in
our countries.

Thank you.  

Victim: The 24-year-old Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was killed in the rampage

Zehaf-Bibeau's rampage began at Canada's war memorial, where he shot and killed Cpl. Nathan Cirillo.

The gunman was later shot to death by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons just steps from where Canada's prime minister and members of Parliament were meeting

Prime Minister Harper called it a terror attack and the bloodshed raised fears Canada was suffering reprisals for joining the US-led air campaign against Islamic State extremists in Iraq.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said he believes Zehaf-Bibeau was influenced by others and that the investigation is ongoing.

He said: 'I wouldn't characterize it as network as it is commonly understood but I am persuaded that he was influenced by other individuals toward these crimes so in that sense I am of the view that others were involved.'

Paulson said anybody who aided Zehaf-Bibeau in the attack will be charged with terrorism offenses, according to the CBC. 

He said: 'It's not relevant to us, or our investigation, what kind of terrorist Zehaf-Bibeau was, or if he was a particularly intelligent, sophisticated, influential or personally disciplined terrorist.

'To us, it all turns on the evidence we collect which we compare against the statute. 

'What was he doing and why was he doing it?' 

Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau was likely influenced by others

A photo released by the RCMP shows the .30-30 Winchester Model 94 rifle used by Zehaf-Bibeau in October

More than 130 full-time investigators and staff from the RCMP are working on the case.

Other details from the investigation were also made public.

Police revealed Zehaf-Bibeau used the internet and payphones to stay in contact with people in Ottawa and in British Columbia. 

Police have identified some of these individuals.

The autopsy toxicology report showed Zehaf-Bibeau, who struggled with crack addiction, wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack.

The evidence also 'does not speak to any mental health issues'.

The gunman, who also held Libyan citizenship, became increasingly aligned with terrorist ideology in recent years while living in British Columbia and Alberta.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police intervention teams responded to the shooting after gunfire was heard

Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a crack problem, wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack

Zehaf-Bibeau was involved with shootings at the War Memorial and at the Parliament. Police initially thought there was a shooting at the Rideau Centre mall, but have since said that was not the case

When Zehaf-Bibeau was killed in Parliament, he had a long knife tied to his wrist.

He had toured the main Parliament building while posing as a tourist a couple of weeks before the attack. 

The attack in Ottawa came two days after a man described as an 'ISIL-inspired terrorist' ran over two soldiers in a parking lot in Quebec, killing one and injuring the other before being shot to death by police. 

The man had been under surveillance by Canadian authorities, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey.

Unlike the attacker in the Quebec case, Zehaf-Bibeau was not being watched by authorities.
