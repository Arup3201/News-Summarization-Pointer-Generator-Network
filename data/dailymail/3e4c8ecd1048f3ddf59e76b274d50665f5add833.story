Aside from launching a range of new phones, building its latest operating system and even setting up a barge off the coast of San Francisco, Google has been stealthily building a robotics empire. 

Over the past six months Google has bought seven technology companies that each specialise in robotics or automated systems. 

These include Meka, which makes humanoid robots, and Industrial Perception, which specialises in machines that can package goods and load up lorries, for example.

Google has recently bought seven companies that specialise in robotics including California-based Meka, which makes humanoid robots, pictured. The firm isn't expected to make these technologies available to consumers but instead could use them to automate deliveries of goods

Over the past six months, Google has bought seven technology companies that specialise in robotics and automated systems:

Meka, in San Francisco and Japanese firm Schaft both design and make humanoid robots.

San Francisco-based Autofuss, and sister company Bot & Dolly, make systems designed for filmmakers in which cameras are attached to precision-motion machines.

Google has worked with Autofuss on various advertising campaigns.

Redwood Robotics, also in San Francisco, 
designs robotics arms used in hospitals and factories, while Holomni 
specialises in systems that accelerate vehicles in different 
directions.

Finally, Industrial Perception in California specialises in machines that can package 
goods and load up lorries, for example. 

Google’s investment in these firms has been led by Andy Rubin, the founder of its Android operating system. 

While the firm is not expected to make these technologies available to consumers, it could instead use them to automate deliveries of goods, for example.

According to the New York Times: ‘A realistic case, according to several specialists, would be automating portions of an existing supply chain that stretches from a factory floor to the companies that ship and deliver goods to a consumer’s doorstep.’

Other companies Google has acquired include Bot & Dolly, which makes cameras fixed to robots for use in Hollywood films such as Gravity and promotions for video games including Halo: Remember Reach.

It also bought Bot & Dolly’s sister company Autofuss, which Google has worked with on various advertising campaigns.

Google also bought Japanese firm Schaft that, like Meka, designs and makes humanoid robots.

The company hasn’t confirmed, or denied, exactly what the robots will be used for but co-founder Larry Page wrote on Google+: ‘I am excited about Andy Rubin's next project. 

'His last big bet, Android, started off as a crazy idea that ended up putting a supercomputer in hundreds of millions of pockets.

'It is still very early days for this, but I can't wait to see the progress.’ 

And it may take years for the plans to be fully announced, or even became available, as Rubin explained to he New York Times: 'Like any moonshot, you have to think of time as a factor. We need enough runway and a 10-year vision.'

At the start of this week Amazon unveiled its own secret research project which it claims will be the future of home delivery - packages delivered by drones.

The Internet shopping giant’s chief executive Jeff Bezos says that he wants to use octocoptors to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes.

Customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber.

Google's news comes just days after Amazon announced plans to roll out a drone delivery service in 'four to five years' that could allow customers to receive packages within 30 minutes of placing an order
