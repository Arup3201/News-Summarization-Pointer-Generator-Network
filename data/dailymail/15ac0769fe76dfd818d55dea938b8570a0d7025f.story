Top: Harvard, the oldest academic institute in the U.S., dating from 1636, was named number one again

University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, Yale, California Institute of Technology and Columbia rank six to ten respectively.

The results show that for the fifth year in a row there is an elite group of six US and UK ‘super brands’, the authors suggested, which are ‘head and shoulders above the rest’.

While Harvard took first place again, Cambridge moved up from fourth, and Oxford, rose from fifth to third.

M.I.T. was down two on last year to fourth place, while Stanford fell two places to fifth and University of California, Berkeley remained in sixth.

Columbia steps into the top ten displacing University of California, Los Angeles, which slipped to 13th position.

Overall, the U.S. remains dominant with 43 top 100 places, compared with 46 last year.

The U.K. with 12 representatives, up from 10 in 2014, has had a strong year and remains firmly entrenched as the world number two when it comes to global university brands. 

Aside from Oxford and Cambridge, other U.K. universities in the top 100 include Imperial College London, which falls one place to 14th, University College London, which is up eight places to 17th, and the London School of Economics and Political Science which has moved from 24th to 22nd.

There has also been a marked improvement by universities in Brazil, Russia and China, and a continued solid performance from academic institutions across Europe, as well as in Canada, Australia, and across Asia.

The rankings are based on a survey of about 10,000 academics in 142 countries.

They were asked to nominate up to ten of the best institutions in the world for teaching and research.

Responses were collected between November 2014 and January 2015.

Harvard has ranked number one for each of the five years that the survey has been conducted.

The oldest academic institute in the U.S., dating from 1636, the school is named after its first benefactor, John Harvard.

It has the global academy's largest financial endowment and boasts more than 40 Nobel laureates.
