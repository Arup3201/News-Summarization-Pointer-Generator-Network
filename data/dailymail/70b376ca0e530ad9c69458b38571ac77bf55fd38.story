Lying in a hospital cot, his tiny body hooked up to a tangle of tubes and an artificial heart, Jack Morris is clinging on to life.

It is a distressing picture, but one his father hopes could help save his life.

Chris Morris released the image of his 15-month-old son yesterday in a desperate bid to find him a new heart.

Tiny Jack Morris is desperately poorly in the Newcastle transplant centre and
 father Chris is appealing for more parents to consider donating their 
child's organs after death

The railway signalman said his youngest child’s only hope of survival is a donated organ.

But Jack, who has a rare condition 
which means his heart doesn’t pump blood around his body properly, has 
already been waiting five months and will die unless a heart is found.

Mr Morris said: ‘It was devastating to
 be told he needed a transplant, but then you see that there is hope and
 you cling to that and pray for the phone call to say they’ve found a 
match.

‘If Jack isn’t giving up, then we have no right to either. His only hope now is a donated organ – or a miracle.

Father Chris Morris, pictured with Jack's big brother Alex, four, has issued a desperate plea for an organ for his seriously ill son

A heart transplant is recommended for children who have serious heart dysfunction and will not be able to live without having the heart replaced. There are around 30 such transplants per year and these are performed at Great Ormond Street in London or the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne.

About half the transplants in children are needed for cardiomyopathy and the other half for inborn abnormalities of the heart, so called congenital heart disease.

When a suitable heart from an organ donor becomes available it is allocated to an appropriate recipient on the basis of size and blood group.

A series of precise measurements are made on the function of the donor’s heart. If it is suitable it will be removed and stored on ice and transported rapidly to the transplant centre. In the meanwhile the potential recipient is anaesthetised and his or her chest is opened.

Once the new heart arrives, the recipient’s heart is removed. The patient is kept alive in the meanwhile by the use of a heart lung machine.

The new heart is rapidly sewn into position in the chest.  With its new blood supply the heart restarts and in due course takes over the circulation.  Most patients will spend 2 or 3 weeks in hospital after their transplant.

Many transplant patients are desperately sick but nevertheless 85-90 per cent of them will survive the period after the transplant and for at least a year.  Failure of the new heart to function well immediately after the transplant is the commonest cause of early death and occurs in 5-10 per cent of patients.

There is a constant although small risk of rejection and a risk of infection in patients who have the natural functions of the immune system suppressed by drugs.

The biggest problem as the years go by after a transplant is narrowing of the arteries of the transplanted heart. Nevertheless about three quarters of patients survive 5 years after a transplant and more than half will be alive after 10 years. Particularly for younger patients, if the new heart fails there is the prospect of a repeat or re-transplant.

‘We know that getting a new heart will
 not be a cure and that Jack will have a lifetime of smaller problems, 
but we hope they will be more manageable problems.

‘I just want him to one day be able 
to go outside, to experience walking in the sunshine, picking up a 
snowball, things you wouldn’t normally think twice about doing with your
 children.’

Mr Morris, who has a four-year-old 
son, Alex, with his partner Laura Campbell, 24, said he had issued the 
picture to raise awareness among other parents about organ donation for 
children.

He said: ‘Talking about organ donation, especially when it involves children, is almost a taboo subject.

‘Obviously it is devastating to lose a
 child. But if parents had that discussion about what they would do 
earlier then perhaps when the time comes and they are asked the 
question, they just might say yes.’

Jack appeared to be healthy when he was born, but at around five months he suddenly stopped breathing for a few seconds.

Doctors at Alder Hey Children’s 
Hospital in Liverpool diagnosed whooping cough and allowed him home. But
 a few days later the same thing happened again.

It wasn’t until he collapsed for a 
third time, at the end of October, that doctors realised he actually had
 dilated cardiomyopathy, which stops the left ventricle pumping 
oxygenated blood properly around the body, eventually causing it to 
fail.

Doctors told Mr Morris and Miss 
Campbell, of Anfield, that their son was unlikely to survive without a 
new heart. He is now in a specialist transplant centre in Newcastle, 
kept alive by a plastic artificial heart which pumps blood around his 
body.

Mr Morris said: ‘I’m so thankful for every second of every day that Jack is with us.

‘The thing that upsets me the most is that he may never be able to call me Dad.

‘Jack is awake most of the time, but he has never crawled, never stood up and hardly ever makes a sound, only when he cries.

‘But Jack being given the chance of life is more important than all those little things – our priority is finding a new heart.’

Sally Johnson, director of organ 
donation and transplantation with NHS Blood and Transplant, said three 
people awaiting transplants die each day.

‘Parents who have agreed to donate 
their child’s organs tell us they gain comfort from knowing they have 
saved the lives of other children and adults,’ she said.
