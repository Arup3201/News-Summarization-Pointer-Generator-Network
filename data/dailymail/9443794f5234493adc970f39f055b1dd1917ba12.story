He might have been snubbed at the Oscars, but Ben Affleck had the last laugh with his latest success - when he took home both Best Director and Best Film for his hit movie Argo at the EE BAFTA awards.

The actor-turned-director admitted he was stunned with the double success at the awards ceremony, which took place at London's Royal Opera House on Sunday night.

Collecting the Best Film prize, Affleck told the star-studded audience: 'I was talking to people from the studio and they were like "We never win!" so this really is the most incredible surprise.'Â

Earlier, Affleck was presented with the Best Director award by Ian McKellen, and said of his prize: 'I want to say this is a second act
 for me and you've given me that, this industry has given me that and I 
want to thank you and I'm so grateful and proud.'

Affleck's producer partner George Clooney later told the actor: 'I've got to say Ben, if this is your second act, I don't know what you're going to do for your third act.

 think there's something about this that begs a trilogy, three movies

one's going to be yet.'
