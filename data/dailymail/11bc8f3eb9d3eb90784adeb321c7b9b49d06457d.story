Haunting images of the past have emerged, showing vintage black and white portraits of Australian women.

But these are no ordinary women. These are the not-so-innocent faces of convicted criminals who were put behind bars from the 1880s to 1930s.

Among them include the infamous razor gangster and prominent madam of the times - Matilda 'Tilly' Devine.

Others include backyard abortionists, drug dealers and those convicted of bigamy, drunkenness and theft.

According to Live Leak, most of them were sent to the State Reformatory for Women, Long Bay - south of Sydney - which is now known as Long Bay Correctional Complex.
