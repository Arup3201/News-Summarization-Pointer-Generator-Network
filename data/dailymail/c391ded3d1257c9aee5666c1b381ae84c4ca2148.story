Rescuers continued to search this morning for a Sacramento teen who was swept over a 600-foot waterfall in Yosemite National Park over the weekend.

Authorities presume that the victim, Aleh Kalman, 19, didn't survive.

'We believe it's impossible to survive a fall like that,' a Park spokesman told CNN.

Aleh Kalman, 19, is presumed to have died after he fell over a 600-foot waterfall at Yosemite National Park over the weekend

According to the National Park Service, Kalman was visiting the park with a church group about 2:45 p.m. Saturday when he was seen swimming in the Merced River above Nevada Fall.

Park officials say he was swept away by the current as he was swimming back from a large rock located in the middle of the river.

Teams of rescue workers - as well as a California Highway Patrol helicopter - were immediately dispatched in an effort to locate Kalman.

Additionally, park rangers are using three dog teams to help locate Kalman.

Park officials say the river was running at 500 cubic feet per second when Kalman was swept away, which 'represents a swift and powerful spring flow of water.'

'Although the park received only 50 percent of normal snow pack, rivers 
within the park continue to run at high levels this time of the year,' 
the service said. 'Additionally, the water remains extremely cold and 
will be throughout the year.'

The search effort has forced Park officials to close a section of the park near the waterfall as crews continue to comb the banks of the river.

In 2011, three other people were swept over the 317-foot Vernal waterfall on the Merced River.
