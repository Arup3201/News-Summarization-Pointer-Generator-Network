Martin Odegaard visited Arsenal on Tuesday as he continued his tour of Europe's biggest clubs - but Bayern Munich remain confident they will land his signature.

Bayern were hoping they could announce the Norwegian wonderkid's signing as early as Wednesday, the date of Odegaard's 16th birthday, but the Gunners' late interest may have thrown a spanner in the works.

Odegaard, who will also move on to visit Manchester United before making another trip to Liverpool while in England. has trained at Bayern and Liverpool in recent weeks with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United and Manchester City also registering an interest.

Celtic, managed by Odegaard's former boss at Stromsgodset, Ronny Deila, are keen to bring the teenager to Glasgow but they are outsiders for his signature.

Stromsgodset will be due a compensation package should Odegaard opt to leave his homeland.

The attacking midfielder has made 25 appearances for Stromsgodset since making his debut in April and has scored five goals.

He already has three full caps for Norway having made his debut in August.

Odegaard has been guided in negotiations by his father, Hans Erik, who was a professional footballer in the Norwegian league and who is now the assistant manager at Mjondalen.

Hans Erik was also at Arsenal on Tuesday as his son trained with the first-team.

Speaking recently, Celtic boss Ronny Deila said his club have not made their interest in Odegaard known officially to Stromsgodset but believes his contacts in Drammen will keep him informed of any developments.

‘I haven’t (made Celtic’s interest clear),’ he said. ‘But I have control over the situation.

‘I know what’s happening. He’s in the town where my kids live and I know a lot of people there.

‘We’ll see. If there are possibilities, of course, we will try it. But it’s a very hard competition.’

With five loan signings on Celtic’s books just now, Deila had not discounted the possibility of attempting to bring Odegaard to Glasgow for a season were he to head for the continent.

‘You never know, but we want to have players that we want to get something for if we develop them,’ he said. ‘You can’t have too many players from other clubs. We need to have players who we can earn money on or who can stay at our club.’

Asked if Odegaard was good enough at the moment to play for Celtic, Deila replied: ‘It’s very hard to say. He’s only 15 years old and will be 16 this month, but he is very special and every time he gets to a new level, he takes his chance. His attitude is great - he always wants to learn and he listens to everything you say. He’s special.’
