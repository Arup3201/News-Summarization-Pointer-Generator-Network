A father who was caught on camera whipping his teenage daughters with cable wire has been charged with child endangerment and corporal punishment, authorities said on Thursday.

Greg Horn, 35, allegedly beat his two daughters, aged 12 and 14, after he caught them filming a 'twerk' video and posting it on Facebook at their home in Dayton, Ohio. 

'Twerking' is a sexually provocative dance move that involves gyrating the lower body.
