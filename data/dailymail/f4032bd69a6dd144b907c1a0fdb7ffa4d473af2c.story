Virgin Atlantic will run its first domestic flight service between London and the North, the company announced yesterday.

Virgin, founded by billionaire Sir Richard Branson, will operate three daily return flights between Heathrow and Manchester for £95 from March.

The new routes will bring it into direct competition with British Airways, which it claims has a monopoly on the route, and analysts say the two companies are poised to begin a price war.

Virgin Atlantic will operate three daily flights to Manchester from March next year, it was reported today

Critics yesterday accused Sir 
Richard, whose company Virgin Trains lost its West Coast mainline rail 
contract last week, of ‘taking revenge’ on his rivals and creating an 
air route instead.

But Virgin insisted the move was a 
response to the BA takeover of bmi last year rather than the company’s 
loss of the rail service between the two cities.

BA operates 12 return flights a day between London and Manchester – nine from Heathrow – costing from £97.

The equivalent train route, which is 
run by  Virgin Trains but will pass to FirstGroup in December, costs 
£296 for an any-time return.

Flights between Heathrow and the North
West will begin on March 31 using leased aircraft, Virgin Atlantic 
chief executive Steve Ridgway said.

Virgin chief executive Steve Ridgway said the move was aimed at keeping Manchester and London connected with the rest of the world

He added: ‘Since bmi was swallowed up 
by BA, the competition that existed on domestic routes and European 
routes has disappeared.

'This is part of the process of making sure that 
BA doesn’t become a monopolist on all the routes bmi used to fly.’

Virgin already flies from Manchester to Barbados and Las Vegas and to Orlando in Florida.

Manchester
Airports Group chief commercial officer Ken O'Toole said today: 'We are
pleased to see Virgin Atlantic increasing their presence in Manchester 
and to see competition returning on the London route, as that will be to
the benefit of passengers flying from our airport.'

Tickets for the new London-Manchester service went on sale yesterday.
