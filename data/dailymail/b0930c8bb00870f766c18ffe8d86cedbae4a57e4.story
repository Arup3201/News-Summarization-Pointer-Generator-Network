Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott are the sixth English pair to score more than 100 runs together on 10 occasions, and the England captain is part of three of them. They follow: 

1. Hobbs and Sutcliffe (1924-30) — 15

2. Cook and Strauss (2006-12) — 14

3. Cook and Pietersen (2006-13) — 13

4. Trescothick and Vaughan (2000-05) — 10

5. Bell and Pietersen (2005-14) — 10

6. Cook and Trott (2009-15) — 10

STANDING TALL 

Remarkably, their opening-stand century was England’s first in Test cricket for more than two years — since March 2013 when Cook and Nick Compton scored an impressive 231 against New Zealand in Dunedin.  

KIWI BLOW 

News comes from the Indian Premier League  that New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson is a doubt for next month’s series in England after breaking a finger.

BLACKWOOD BRUISED 

Jermaine Blackwood was in the wars on Thursday, twice being hit in the body by Cook shots after spinner Devindra Bishoo dragged down a couple of long hops. 

The second blow was a hefty one, Cook pulling the ball into the hip of the turning fielder.

BLISTERING SHANNON

West Indies bowler Shannon Gabriel  picked up where he left off after reaching 93mph on Wednesday. 

Jonathan Trott was ducking away from balls just like on the last Ashes tour against Mitchell Johnson, but it was Alastair Cook and Ian Bell who fell to Gabriel, whose fastest delivery was 94.3mph.

YORKSHIRE UNREST

There has been some disquiet from Yorkshire that four of their players are in England’s squad but not in the team and they are keen to get Adil Rashid back soon. 

But it’s not football. Country comes first. And England are working with Rashid to try to make him a top-class bowler.
