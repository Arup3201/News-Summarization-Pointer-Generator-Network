Cover your children's ears, Kim Sears is back and she doesn't care who's listening. 

The Australian Open final may be have been a depressing affair for Andy Murray, who lost in four sets to Novak Djokovic, but Sears still found time to poke fun at the lighter side of the couple's time in Melbourne.

The 27-year-old was caught swearing on camera during Murray's semi-final clash with Tomas Berdych, apparently mouthing 'F***** have that you Czech flash f***'.

And while most of the world reacted with a mix of surprise and even indignation, Sears showed the ability to laugh at herself by wearing a T-shirt that said 'Parental advisory explicit content'.  

When asked about the initial outburst, Murray said:  'I was told about that. When there’s a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, then it’s completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight. 

'My physical trainer, the physio, I’m sure for Dani it was uncomfortable, even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court. There was tension there for him as well. In the heat of the moment you say stuff that you regret.' 

And Murray may well be left with a few things of his own to regret after Sunday's final defeat by Djokovic.

The British No 1 began the match strongly but fell away after the second set and was eventually beaten 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-0.
