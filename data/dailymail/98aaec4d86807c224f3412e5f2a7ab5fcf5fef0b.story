Scientists hope to be able to beat obesity within years by 'rewiring' brains to reduce appetites after researchers made a significant breakthrough.

They hope to develop drugs that can control the amount we eat from infancy, or later in life for those who are overweight.

It is hoped the findings could lead to a 'permanent solution' for tackling obesity within years.

Obesity battle: Scientists hope to develop a pill which can stop obesity within years after a breakthrough by researchers at the University of East Anglia

Scientists had thought nerve cells in 
the brain associated with appetite control were produced in the womb and could not be changed.

But new research has identified a group of stem cells capable of triggering new appetite-regulating neurons in mice in an area of the brain known as the hypothalmus.

The University of East Anglia scientists hope to apply their findings to humans within five to 10 years.

Dr Mohammad Hajihosseini said: 'Unlike dieting, translation of this discovery could eventually offer a permanent solution for tackling obesity.

'Loss or malfunctioning of neurons in the hypothalamus is the prime cause of eating disorders such as obesity.

'Until recently we thought all of 
these nerve cells were generated during the embryonic period and so the 
circuitry that controls appetite was fixed.

'But
 this study has shown the neural circuitry that controls appetite is not
 fixed in number and could possibly be manipulated numerically to tackle
 eating disorders.

'Our hope is that drugs could effect these stem cells in such a way that more appetite suppressing neurons are produced, or even appetite suppressing ones. This means babies, for instance, with obese mothers could be primed from infancy to eat less.

'But although our main objective is to combat obesity with this, it could also work at the other end of the spectrum. Anorexics could be made to produce more appetite promoting neurons, so they eat more.'

The findings were published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally causing rising rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, arthritis and cancer.

The economic burden on the NHS in the UK is estimated to be more than £5billion annually. In the US, the healthcare cost tops $60billion.

The researchers say their findings could help develop drugs that could one day lead to a permanent intervention in infancy for those predisposed to obesity, or later in life as the disease becomes apparent.

More than 1.4billion adults worldwide are overweight and more than half a billion are obese. And at least 2.8million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese.

The hypothalamus section of the brain regulates sleep and wake cycles, energy expenditure, appetite, thirst, hormone release and many other critical biological functions.

Looking specifically at the nerve cells that regulate appetite, the researchers used a genetic mapping technique tracking the development of stem cells and cells derived from them, at desired time points during the life of an animal.

They established a population of brain cells called 'tanycytes' behave like stem cells and add new neurons to the appetite-regulating circuitry of the mouse brain after birth and into adulthood.

Dr Mohammad Hajihosseini said: 'The next step is to define the group of genes and cellular processes that regulate the behaviour and activity of tanycytes.

'This information will further our understanding of brain stem cells and could be exploited to develop drugs that can modulate the number or functioning of appetite-regulating neurons.

'Our long term goal of course is to translate this work to humans, which could take up to five or ten years.

It could lead to a permanent intervention in infancy for those predisposed to obesity, or later in life as the disease becomes apparent.'
