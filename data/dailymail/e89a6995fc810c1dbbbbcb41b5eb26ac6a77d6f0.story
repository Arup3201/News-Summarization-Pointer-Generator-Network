Renowned as much for her passionate battle to revive the British high street as she is for her bright red bob, Mary Portas is not a woman to sit back and watch injustices happen. Particularly when it comes to shopping.

As she launches her new fashion line for House of Fraser, the mother-of-three spoke to Good Housekeeping magazine about her disbelief that women just one year out of their thirties are made to feel 'invisible' when buying clothes, and why her anger drove her to target women over 40 with her new collection.

Queen of Shops Mary Portas has created a line of clothes for House of Fraser aimed at the over-40s, who she feels are 'invisible' on the British high street

Portas, 53, said: 'Women of this age are genuinely 
invisible on the high street. Most shops when they are targeting women 
use 18-year-old models.

'What are we doing here? There must be something 
unattractive about being old - that's the message, and I think that's a 
really ugly message.

'I wanted to create a collection that had women of 
that age in the campaign and which thought about their bodies and the 
things that are important to them - what we can highlight and what we 
don't want to highlight!'

Talking about having the confidence to look good once you're over a certain age, she said: 'I'm 53! You have permission to push 
boundaries. I call it the mutton moment.

'It's when women look in the 
mirror and think 'Can I, can't I?' We need more women to stand up and 
say it's okay! Confidence comes from you having a sense of yourself.

'It's about really understanding your 
body, your shape and what makes you feel confident when you put it on. 
Try to look at the clothes in different colours, but know your basic 
shape.

'I come back to that time and time again. I am no good at a 
vintage layered look. I end up looking like Grayson Perry! No offence, Grayson, it just doesn't suit me.'

She continued: 'The
 really important thing is to be always moving and to always push 
boundaries. So many women will fall into a comfort zone, a safety place.

'I have been lucky enough to be in a world where there's always 
something new that happens. But I think it only happens because I 
embrace the new as well. I embrace fear, too.'

When it comes to staying in shape, Portas said she was lucky enough to find that easy: 'I'm
 very lucky, as I inherited my father's genes. He was very slim. But 
keeping yourself healthy is something that everyone should work at.'

She continued:'I 
have never dieted, but I normally run three times a week and do some 
yoga. I haven't been running much lately with a baby, though!

'I used to 
roll out of bed, get into some running gear and go for a run. But now 
you roll out of bed and he's there! But I do push him in the buggy 
around Regent's Park.'

The
 retail guru, who has two teenage children with her ex-husband Graham 
Portas and a toddler with her civil partner Melanie Rickey, also said 
she feel's 'extraordinarily blessed' by her children, but that she 
thinks 'that's it now'.

About staying sane, Portas said that her secret is the odd bit of meditation: 'I am a bit rubbish 
at it, but I do it! I'm a great walker, and my walking boots are always 
in the back of the car.

'I'm a bit of a Forrest Gump. If I can walk, I 
will walk - I love it. It really cleanses my head. I also love a glass 
of red wine!'
