It should have been the happiest day of their lives, but one newlywed couple spent their wedding in hospital after the groom's mother collapsed. 

Frazer Mataitonga's mother Agnes, who had flown 10,000 miles from her native Tonga, was taken ill on the way to church, and died later of a major heart attack.

Mr Mataitonga and his bride Victoria Reeves, 35, went ahead with the ceremony, believing she had simply fainted.

Tragic: Soon after this photo was taken Frazer Mataitonga and Victoria Reeves realised the full extent of Agnes' condition and dashed from St Mary's Church, Handbridge, Chester, still in their wedding outfits, to be at her bedside

Heartbreaking: Mrs Mataitonga, 58, died two days later. She had flown half away across the world from the South Pacific Island of Tonga - a 21-hour flight - with husband Amos

It wasn’t until afterwards they learned she was fighting for her life.

They dashed from St Mary’s Church, Handbridge, Chester, still in their wedding outfits, to be at her bedside.

They spent their wedding night in the intensive care unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital last Saturday, but Mrs Mataitonga, 58, died two days later.

She had flown half away across the world from the South Pacific Island of Tonga - a 21-hour flight -with husband Amos.

Sight seeing: Bride Victoria said 'It was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives, our wedding day, such a joyous occasion but in reality it was the opposite'

Bride Victoria said: 'It was such a devastating shock for us all to lose Agnes. Our world has been turned upside down. It was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives, our wedding day, such a joyous occasion but in reality it was the opposite.

'Agnes was the most amazing, beautiful person, loved by so many, her death has affected so many people.'

The rest of the guests were looked after by management at Chester Racecourse, where the wedding reception was due to be held, and the venue provided the anxious couple with a car and driver to get them to and from the hospital.

Frazer Mataitonga, who is Tongan, is a soldier in the 1st Mercian regiment, based in Catterick, Yorkshire, and his new wife Victoria works for the NHS.

Happier times: The newly-weds, from Westminster Park, Chester, celebrated a very public engagement after Frazer's surprise proposal at Chester Amphitheatre last June at an open air film screening

They now have to find an estimated £20,000 to fly Mrs Mataitonga’s body home to Tonga to be buried in the family graveyard.

Frazer’s sister Mary Ann, best man and brother William, and others who had flown over especially to be at the wedding.

Victoria’s devastated family, mother and father Margaret and Philip Reeves, sister Charlotte, 27, and brother James, 31, of Coed Esa Lane, New Broughton, Wrexham, have been rallying round the grieving couple.

Mr Reeves is a retired operations manager at Ball Packaging and the family moved to the town from Milton Keynes when Victoria was 18.

Her younger sister attended St Joseph’s High School.

The newly-weds, from Westminster Park, Chester, who celebrated a very public engagement after Frazer’s surprise proposal at Chester Amphitheatre last June at an open air film screening which formed part of the Chestival programme, say they are completely broke after paying for what should have been the happiest day of their lives on Saturday.

They are now desperate for help after the tragedy.

Mrs Mataitonga, who had been filled with excitement ahead of her son’s big day, sadly lost her fight for life surrounded by her loved ones

Victoria said: 'We are appealing for as much help as possible to ensure Agnes is flown home to be in the family graveyard as her final resting place, close to all her loved ones and the people she loved, and who loved her dearly.

'We want to do this so much for her, it is the least we can do.'

The couple, who met three years ago, wish to thank all of their loved ones from Tonga and Victoria’s family, who live in New Broughton, Wrexham, for their continuing support during a difficult time.

They are now appealing to funeral directors who may be able to assist with Mrs Mataitonga’s repatriation, and businesses, or organisations who may find it in their hearts to help financially with the huge costs involved.

Up to 2,000 mourners are expected to attend the’ funeral, with people flying in from all over the world.

Frazer, 27, who is Tongan and originally from New Zealand, said his mother, who was a devout Christian, will be remembered for her loving caring nature, her giving ways, and not least her countless fundraising missionary travels.

Victoria added: 'Our pockets are empty after the wedding, and paying for four of our Tongan relatives to fly to the UK to be here for the wedding, we have nothing left.

'The Tongans rarely travel this far and travel insurance is not a common product in the South Pacific, so our relatives also have nothing to contribute to Agnes’ repatriation.'We are hoping and praying that we can seek assistance in our sombre and most unexpected task.'

'Now, when we celebrate our wedding anniversary, we will celebrate Agnes and her life and the amazing person she was. We will miss her so much,' the couple said.
