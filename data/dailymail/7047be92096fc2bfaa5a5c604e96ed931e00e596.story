She's recognized wherever she goes and counts Rihanna among her fans - and it's for one very impressive attribute: Her rounded rear end.

Jen Selter, 20, from New York City, has amassed more than 1.3 million followers on her Instagram account, @jenselter, after posting poses from her workout and yoga sessions.

Just one picture of her on a workout ball or squatting at the gym can garner as many as 80,000 likes, and thousands consider her a fitness inspiration.

'I'm recognized wherever I am,' Selter told the New York Post. 'I don't really go to public gyms anymore 
just because it is a whole big scene when I'm there. I 
don't like being watched.'

Famous asset: Jen Selter, 20, from New York, has amassed 1.3 million followers on Instagram after posing pictures of her pert behind. She says she aims to be an inspiration for other people to get fit

Fitness fanatic: Photos of Selter working out at the gym can garner as many as 80,000 'likes'

She admits that her photos are always focused on her rounded behind, explaining: 'I don't really post a lot of face pictures... They don't want to see my face.'

Selter, who is single and lives with her mother on the Upper West Side, took cosmetology classes while holding side jobs at a plastic surgeon's office and a gym after graduating high school.

When she started working out at the gym, she noticed that her behind began getting bigger and was inspired by the transformation.

She joined Instagram in March 2012 and began posting images of her body. When she saw people reposting her images, she asked for a credit and her number of followers boomed.

Once she achieved 300,000 followers, sponsorship offers piled up from companies including Nike, Lululemon and New Balance, among others.

She has since quit her gym job and secured deals with water company NY20 and a nutrition supplement company, Game Plan Nutrition, for which she is a spokeswoman.

While she would not reveal how much she makes from these deals, Selter, who did not go to college, said they give her 'a lot more money than a graduate would be making'.

Her mother, Jill Weinstein, said she couldn't be more proud of her daughter and her following.

'I'm very proud of her because this is a girl who didn’t want to go to college, and she was able to build up this social media in such a way that she has become famous and she is an inspiration and motivation for so many people,' she told the Post.

Many followers have suggested her 
plump derriere is fake - but she insists it is real, explaining that the
 only cosmetic surgery she has undergone was a nose job as a teenager.

'I'm Jewish,' she said. 'Jewish girls have big noses. Probably 1 out of 3 girls I know [has] a nose job.'

Selter, who hopes to create a line of workout gear or even her own chain of gyms, admits that some of the photos can be 'showy' - but said that she simply wants to inspire people.

'I see myself motivating and inspiring everyone around the world,' she told the Post. 'With hard work and dedication, anyone can get to where I am.'
