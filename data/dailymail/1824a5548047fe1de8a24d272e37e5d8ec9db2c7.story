About 2 million Chase customers that used their debit cards at Target stores between November 27 and December 15 will have their daily spending and withdrawal limits drastically tightened to prevent thieves from stealing their money.

JPMorgan Chase & Co announced on Saturday that those customers now have a $100 daily withdrawal limit and $300 purchasing limit with their cards.

In an email sent to customers, the subject line read 'Unfortunately, your debit card is at risk by the breach at Target stores,' Al Jazeera reports.

Chase said the changes 'could not have happened at a more inconvenient time.'

The new spending limits affect approximately 10 percent of Chase debit cards, Reuters reports.

Normal daily cash withdrawal limits are $200 to $500 and $500 for purchases, it adds.

On Thursday, Target said computer hackers stole data from as many as 40 million users who visited its stores during the 20-day period, according to The New York Times.

Cards stolen in the breach are already being sold on the black market, fetching anywhere from $20 to more than $100 per card, according to security industry blog Krebs on Security.

The website reports thieves are able to purchase access to the accounts by using virtual currencies like BitCoin, as well as wire transfers.

The theft is the second-largest credit card breach in US history, Al Jazeera reports. A 2005 scam involving TJX Cos affect at least 45.7 million card users.

On Saturday, Target said it is helping customers get credit reports and change personal identification numbers on their cards to further prevent fraud, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Credit cards are unaffected by the bank's measures.

Initial reports of Target's security breach said data may have been taken through devices at its counters, Reuters says.
