Homeowners who were duped into buying expensive insurance cover for burst pipes, broken boilers and blocked drains could be entitled to a refund.

The news emerged as the giant Homeserve company suspended all telesales calls amid suspicions of widespread mis-selling.

The company, which calls itself the UK’s ‘fifth emergency service’, has three million customers in this country, holding 7.5million policies.

It claims to offer peace of mind to anyone worried about losing their boiler or water supply in the dead  of winter.

Insurance policies covering central heating start at £7.43 a month and are backed with a promise to send out engineers to fix any problems.

The decision to halt sales of the policies followed complaints about aggressive phone-marketing tactics.

The business faces allegations that customers were misled or bullied into taking out unnecessary or inadequate policies.

There are concerns that the sales scripts used by staff gave misleading information to potential customers.

Online
forums on consumer websites carry tales of woe, including concerns that
the company uses clauses in its small print to avoid helping customers 
in emergencies.

The sale of financial products, such as insurance, is regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS).

The FOS is aware of a number of complaints about Homeserve, while the FSA is now expected to launch an investigation. The initial internal investigation was triggered by customer complaints.

Homeserve then appointed business analysts Deloitte to carry out an independent inquiry.

As a result of the findings, the Homeserve telesales operation was suspended at the weekend to allow for around 500 staff to be retrained.

Incoming calls, where potential customers contact the company, are due to resume today, but outward sales activity, or cold calls, will take longer to start again.

Homeserve chief executive Richard Harpin said: ‘We are determined to ensure customers receive the  highest standards of service and we have therefore taken swift action  to address the issues identified by our review.’

Customers who feel they may have been mis-sold a Homeserve policy can complain to the company directly and seek a refund.

If they are not satisfied, they can complain to the FOS.
