Britain is enjoying a ‘robust recovery’ more than five years after the financial crisis struck, the Bank of England said yesterday.

Stronger-than-expected growth means unemployment is falling faster than anticipated as private companies hire new staff to keep up with demand, it said.

The bullish comments came amid a wave of economic good news as figures showed the number of private businesses now trading in Britain has soared to a record of nearly five million.

A separate report showed a 40 per cent jump in mortgage lending to its highest level since 2009, and business lending on the rise after years of decline.

Booming car production and soaring sales at Argos, Homebase, Sports Direct and online fashion retailer Asos bolstered hopes that the recovery is picking up pace.

But the Bank warned that the recovery ‘might be less well balanced’ than hoped as exports remain muted and growth is driven by the housing market and debt-fuelled spending.

Official figures published tomorrow are expected to show the economy growing at its fastest rate since the general election in May 2010.

It is thought that gross domestic product rose by 0.8 per cent between July and September.

It will give George Osborne the chance to repeat his claim that ‘Britain is turning a corner’.

A source close to the Chancellor said: ‘The economy is doing well but we still have a huge deficit and the job is very far from done.’

A separate report by the Department for Business showed that a record 4.9million private companies are now trading in Britain – 102,000 more than a year ago and 447,000 more than in 2010.

Rosana Mirkovic of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants said: ‘It is good news that the UK is becoming fertile ground for new, small businesses.

‘However, survival and growth of those small businesses is essential for these figures to really count towards the UK’s recovery.’

A sharp increase in bank lending fuelled hopes that the outlook for business is improving.

A report by the British Bankers’ Association showed net lending to firms rose by £2.5billion in September, the biggest increase since January 2009.
