Argentina were welcomed home by thousands of fans celebrating their gutsy performance in the World Cup in Buenos Aires on Monday.

The emotional fans flooded the road leading from the airport to the Argentinian FA complex in Eleiza, hours after their 1-0 defeat to Germany in Rio de Janeiro. 

Argentina last played in a
 World Cup final in 1990, when they lost to West Germany, and were looking to win the competition in their rival's backyard.

They were in greater spirits than on Sunday night in Rio, when Argentina fans appeared to fight amongst themselves.

The fans, wearing the Argentina strips, turn on each other - obviously feeling the effects of a devastating extra-time defeat.

There were also sad scenes in Buenos Aires as riot police fired tear gas and used water cannons to restrain a group of youths who were hurling rocks and vandalizing stores at a celebration rally.

Parents with young children could be seen running down streets after police, who at first remained on the sidelines, tried to take back the area near the city's iconic Obelisk after 9pm local time.
