The Tory MP who lied about his role in a Nazi-themed stag party was forced to resign after David Cameron intervened, it was disclosed last night.

Aidan Burley was summoned to a Downing Street showdown after The Mail on Sunday revealed he had failed to tell the truth to an official Tory Party inquiry into the matter.

The Cannock Chase MP insisted he had not lied and made it clear he wanted to hang on to his seat.

But, after further discussions involving Mr Cameron’s senior officials, it was decided he should step down at the next General Election.

‘There were just too many inconsistencies in his story,’ said one insider.

Eventually, Mr Burley decided to throw in the towel and stand down.

It is now more than two years since this paper uncovered Mr Burley’s  role in a Nazi-themed stag do in the French alpine resort of Val Thorens.

Footage showed the MP at the event which featured a toast to the Third Reich and the bridegroom Mark Fournier dressed as an SS officer in a uniform brought by Mr Burley, his best man.

Mr Burley was shortly afterwards sacked as a ministerial aide after admitting ‘clearly inappropriate behaviour’ but further action was put on hold pending a full inquiry and the outcome of court proceedings in France which forbids the wearing of Nazi uniforms and insignia.

Mr Fournier was last month convicted for using the uniform.

But the publication shortly afterwards 
of the Tories’ own report into the event sparked a new storm after this 
newspaper showed Mr Burley had lied to the inquiry by claiming he had 
not been present at a bar where revellers were chanting ‘Hitler’ and 
‘Himmler’.

A Mail on Sunday photograph provided incontrovertible proof that he had been at the bar.

Separately, a tape recording made at the pub, with Nazi chants audible in the background, revealed a member of Mr Burley’s party identifying him as MP for Cannock Chase.

The inquiry also reported Mr Burley had claimed he had left the earlier stag dinner ‘immediately after’ the groom’s brother gave an offensive toast to the Third Reich, giving the impression he had walked out.

But, at best, that account was highly misleading as the entire party left the Restaurant La Fondue at that stage, as video footage taken by this paper clearly shows.

No one from the inquiry, conducted by Tory peer Lord Gold, asked for this paper’s version of the events.

In his resignation statement last week, Mr Burley said: ‘After a difficult time, I have decided to announce I will stand down at the next General Election.’

But insiders said the party’s need to hold Mr Burley’s Cannock Chase seat was a key factor in his standing down.One said: ‘There was a view we’d have a much better chance of defending the seat next year with a new candidate.’

Senior figures in the Jewish community praised The Mail on Sunday’s reporting of the scandal.

Rabbi Aaron Goldstein, senior rabbi of Northwood and Pinner Liberal Synagogue, said: ‘The glorification of Nazi culture and all that it represents is never acceptable. This behaviour is not consistent with holding public office.’

A Tory spokesman insisted the decision to quit had been the MP’s alone.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps last night insisted his party had treated the Aidan Burley affair with the ‘utmost seriousness’.

But he still did not answer a series of questions put to him by The Mail on Sunday. They are:

In a statement last night, the Tory chairman said: ‘The Mail on Sunday exposed an incident that the Conservative Party has treated with the utmost seriousness.’

He added that Lord Gold ‘took the view that all serious and substantive allegations relating to Mr Burley would have been put in the public domain by The Mail on Sunday or other newspapers. On this basis, he reached his conclusions’.

Mr Shapps said that while this paper had highlighted a ‘conflict around the factual account of the precise events of the evening’, that did not impact on the report’s conclusion.

He said: ‘It remains the case that  it is right that your exposure of the incident ended with Mr Burley  losing his job, apologising, and visiting Auschwitz but that equally, Mr Burley was not driven by racism or anti-semitism.’
