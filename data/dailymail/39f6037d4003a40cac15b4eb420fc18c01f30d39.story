Shocking video footage has captured the terrifying moment a woman and her three-year-old nephew are ploughed into by a hit and run driver - and miraculously escape unharmed.

West Midlands Police have released CCTV of the incident to try to track down the driver of the car who sped off without even stopping after running the pair down.

The footage shows a 42-year-old female driving instructor from the Stoke area and her three-year-old nephew carefully looking right and left before starting to cross a road in the Hillfields area of Coventry.

CCTV footage: Cars slow down to allow a woman, 42, and her three-year-old nephew to cross the road

Heart-stopping: A black Audi driver can be seen overtaking the stationary cars be driving on the wrong side of the road

Approaching cars to their right slow down to allow them to cross but an impatient driver behind the waiting cars decides to overtake by speeding down the wrong side of the road straight into the path of the woman and child.

Both are knocked down by the black Audi estate and can be seen being dragged along the road as shopping bags and their contents tumble on to the street.

The driver momentarily slows after the impact but then speeds off without checking on the woman or child as other pedestrians rush into the street to help them.

The car then races down King William Street towards Berry Street as a witness chases after the car in a bid to stop them from fleeing the scene.

Impact: The car then ploughs into the young ploy and his aunt as shocked onlookers stare in disbelief

Just seconds after being hit, the tot 
leaps from the ground and is comforted by passersby who rushed to help 
as his aunt lies dazed on the road.

Incredibly, neither were seriously hurt in the incident just before 7.30pm on Friday 7 December.

PC Abbi Jones from the force's Traffic Unit is investigating the incident.

She said: 'This is a shocking piece of CCTV footage which captures a truly shocking incident.

'We have taken the unusual step of releasing the images - which carries a warning for viewers - in the hope that someone will recognise the car and come forward with information so that we can trace the driver.'

Officers who rushed to the scene were amazed to find that despite the severity of the impact, the pair escaped with only minor injuries - a diagnosis confirmed by doctors at the city's Coventry and Warwickshire University Hospital.

PC Jones said: 'This could have been so much worse. At the time of the collision, the driver would not have known that the woman and child were uninjured.'

Despite national checks of the partial registration plate taken by a witness - EN57 - police have so far been unable to trace the Audi.

Officers now believe the car which will have sustained damage to the front from the impact may be being hidden in a lock-up or garage.

PC Jones said: 'With this in mind I would ask that any mechanics who have repaired a black Audi estate with front end damage between the start of December and now get in touch. Similarly, I want to hear from anyone who has seen a similar car being driven into a lock-up and not come out since.'

Help: Passersby rush over to the woman and child - who miraculously only suffered minor scratches and bruising in the crash

Appeal for information: Police are now urging people to come forward with information that might lead to the identification of the Audi driver
