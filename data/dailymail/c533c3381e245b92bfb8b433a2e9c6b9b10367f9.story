Billy Beane, the baseball guru behind the Moneyball philosophy, has been hired by Dutch club AZ Alkmaar.

Beane, 52, who was played by Brad Pitt in the film about Moneyball and inspired Liverpool and Boston Red Sox owner John W Henry, is general manager at Oakland Athletics.

AZ Alkmaar general director and former professional baseballer Robert Eenhoorn said AZ 'was already very interested in the Moneyball principle before I got here.'

'I have known Billy for a while, because of my history in baseball,' said Eenhoorn, who played four seasons of Major League Baseball with the Yankees and the Angels. 'When we approached him for this role with AZ, he was immediately enthusiastic.

'He has been able to close the gap with the big-market teams, by being innovative. We are very excited and look forward to working with him. Billy will give his advice from the States and he will visit Alkmaar a few times a year.'

Beane was ranked 29th on Joel Sherman’s 'The 50 Most Fascinating Figures in Baseball' for his sometimes mind-boggling but always fascinating approach to the baseball transfer window.

He attracted headlines this off-season for trading away All-Stars such as third basemen Josh Donaldson, catcher Derek Norris and right-handed pitcher Jeff Samardzija.

'I am truly excited for the opportunity to be part of AZ Alkmaar in an advisory role,' Beane said. 

'Despite being a great football club with a storied history, they face many of the challenges we have with the Oakland A’s. My love for football and AZ’s vision of the future of the club made this an attractive pursuit.'
