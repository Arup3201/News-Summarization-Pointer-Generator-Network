Dozens of asylum seekers have been put up in a hotel at a cost to the taxpayer of almost £2,500 a night after facing delays over their right to stay in the UK.

The group has been given accommodation at a three-star hotel near Bolton while waiting for the Home Office to decide on whether they can remain in the country. 

Around 30 people were given taxpayer-funded beds at the Premier Inn in Horwich, which sits opposite the Macron Stadium, home of Bolton Wanderers.

Around 30 asylum seekers have been given taxpayer-funded accommodation at the Premier Inn in Horwich, near Bolton after encountering delays at the Home Office

The hotel in Greater Manchester is more commonly used by football fans and business people.

It comes after it emerged last week that around 150 asylum seekers are being put up at  seaside hotels in Bournemouth.

Some 130 asylum seekers were also revealed to be staying at the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent, close to the Port of Dover.  

Serco, the company which has a £120m five-year contract to find housing for asylum seeks in the North West, confirmed it had made the booking at the 126-room hotel, where rooms costs up to £79 a night.

It is understood the asylum seekers were transferred from their overcrowded accommodation in London at the weekend.

The company said the problem arose due to the number of people in the UK looking for asylum, having fled from conflicts and problems around the world. 

But the move has been criticised, with one Labour MP saying the Border Agency 'really needed to pull its finger out'. Meanwhile, the Taxpayers' Alliance said the use of hotel rooms should be 'a last resort'. 

Last week, it emerged more than 88 asylum seekers were staying at the three-star Roundhouse Hotel, 10 minutes walk from Bournemouth beach

At least 67 were being accommodated at the three-star Heathlands Hotel in Bournemouth

The bill for the hotels will be picked up by Serco, which is paid a lump-sum to run the service on behalf of the Home Office.

Dia Chakravarty's Political Director of the Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'The Government must keep asylum seekers safe and housed, but they can't allow the costs to taxpayers to spiral.

'Hotels are more expensive than almost any other method of housing, so it must only be a last resort.'

Julie Hilling, Labour MP for Bolton West, said: 'The Border Agency really needs to pull its finger out and as soon as possible and process these people's applications for asylum.

'They should either agree they are refugees and help them start a new life, or if decided that they are not legitimate, send them back to their country of origin.

Serco was awarded its five-year contract after Home Secretary Theresa May outsourced the asylum rehousing service to three separate companies

'These are people who have had to flee the most incredible situations and all they want is a place of security and to lead a more normal life - you can't do that in a hotel.

'To live your life in a hotel is absolutely appalling. Housing asylum seekers in hotels isn't costing the borough anything. We all pay through our taxes, but we are not paying through our council tax to re-house these people.'

Ron Clarke of charity Refugee Action said: 'The reason people are being moved into hotels is not due to an increase in numbers of asylum seekers. It is down to a backlog in Home Office decision making.

'The reality is that private providers have not found enough properties for people to be moved into. This is yet another example of the government's failure to support vulnerable people.'

The Home Office provides accommodation and support for asylum seekers in the UK who are assessed as being 'destitute'. 

Serco - which has been warned against the use of hotels - was awarded the contract for the private housing of asylum seekers  in 2012.

A spokesman for the Home Office said it could not divulge the cost of the contract because of 'commercial sensitivity'.

But, according to a response to a Freedom of Information request on the Government website, Serco has a total value contract of £121.2m, which runs from June 2012 to May 2017. 

At the end of 2012, the UK Border Agency (UKBA) replaced 22 separate contracts provided by 13 different suppliers with six contracts to cover the £620m system. These were divided between G4S, Serco and Clearel. 

The move, spearheaded by Home Secretary Theresa May, was known as the Commercial and Operational Managers Procuring Asylum Support Services (COMPASS) project and was supposed to save public money. 

But a National Audit Office report in January found that Serco was failing to meet targets on the standard of accommodation and waiting times.

It said the company could be asked to pay back up to £4 million to the government for poor performance. 

Chris Flood, Serco's Contract Director for Compass, said: 'Serco operates the contract to house asylum seekers requiring accommodation in the North West of England.

'Given international events, there are currently more people looking to the UK for asylum, having fled from the many conflicts and problems around the world.

'We are now consulting urgently with Local Authorities and the Home Office to see how people can best be looked after in line with our contract and the Government's statutory duties.

'We fully understand both the challenges that local communities face and how vulnerable these people can be. Our priority is at all times to make sure that they are safe and secure and are treated with dignity and respect.' 

The Home Office said: 'The UK has a proud history of offering sanctuary to those who need it.

'We have made clear to our providers that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term measure.' 

A spokesman for Premier Inn said: 'We do have a number of people staying with us on a very short-term basis through bookings made on behalf of the government.

'However we do not comment on the specific details regarding individual guests.'
