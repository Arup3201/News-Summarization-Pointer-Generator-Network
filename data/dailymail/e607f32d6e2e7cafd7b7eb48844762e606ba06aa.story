The porn star who ended Anthony Weiner's political career by exposing their sexual online relationship is embroiled in another 'sexting' scandal.

Sydney Leathers has now exposed the kinky fetishes of a Democratic statesman in the American Midwest.

The politician allegedly replied as 'B***h Boy' to an advert the adult actress put out looking for a submissive client who she could 'financially dominate'.

Leathers - who lives in Evansville, Indiana - said B***h Boy was careful never to reveal his name and sent his money through a prepaid PayPal card.

Scandal: Leathers says her new 'sexting' companion goes by the name 'B***h Boy' and sends her lingerie and shoes through the post

Disgraced: Former congressman Anthony Weiner was on the verge of a comeback in 2012 when his online relationship with Leathers emerged in 2012 - as he launched his New York mayoral bid

But the politician who cannot be named for legal reasons did not realise his name was on the parcels containing lingerie and shoes he sent her through Amazon.

She told Page6.com: 'I'm a little speechless. I Googled him and found out he's a lawmaker. Apparently only politicians can pick up on my pheromones.'

Leathers has never met B***h Boy or even talked on the phone. Their entire relationship exists over salacious text messaging.

In one of texts, he said: 'I am your property to do with as you wish, Mistress.' 

To which Sydney replied: 'Yes, because you are weak and pathetic and useless.'

She added in the interview with Page6.com: 'This guy is into some really freaky stuff. He wanted to be forced to wear a French maid outfit and clean my house while I degraded him. 

'He wanted to be tied up and left in a closet to watch me have sex with my boyfriend.'

Leathers describes her political ideology as 'about as liberal as you can get' and admitted she was 'really sad' that he was a Democrat, adding: 'I was really hoping it was a Republican.'

Disgraced politician Anthony Weiner was also a Democrat who served as a US representative in New York's 9th congressional district.

He resigned from congress in 2011 after it was revealed the married man sent explicit pictures of himself to a 21-year-old college student over his Twitter account.

In late 2012, he was on the verge of a potential comeback when he found himself at the centre of another sexting storm with adult actress Sydney Leathers.

The scandal destroyed his bid to become the Democrats' candidate for New York mayor and in October last year he admitted that his political career was 'probably over'.

But unlike Weiner, the adult actress who effectively finished off his life in politics hopes her latest sexting companion does not lose his job.

'Is he displaying poor judgment by sexting me of all people? Obviously,' she said.

'But should sexual situations define politicians? They are human, after all. Some apparently are more human than others.'
