A rare eagle born as part of a breeding programme has grown into one of Britain’s biggest birds thanks to her daily diet - of fish and chips.

The massive bird called ‘Inowashi’ - Japanese for ‘big eagle’ - was hatched in the UK as a small chick five years ago.

Inowashi was one of the first Steller’s sea eagles to be bred in captivity in Britain as part of a scheme to swell the birds’ numbers.

Eagle-eyed: Inowashi the Steller'­s sea eagle and her owner Charlie Heap exchange a glance at The International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire. The bird, which has an 8ft wingspan, enjoys a daily portion of fish from Scott's fish and chip shop in Helmsley and has become one of the biggest in Britain

Any more? Inowashi the Steller's sea eagle spreads its huge wings as it surveys a fish and chip box - its owners have even supplied salt and vinegar for the all round chip shop experience. The huge bird has become one of Britain's biggest and is being looked after at the International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park, in Helmsley, North Yorkshire

But the beautiful creature has since grown into a 14lbs whopper with an 8ft wingspan thanks to her daily fish supper.

Inowashi eats fish and chips seven days a week at International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire.

The super-fit bird likes the meal so much her keepers have been forced to get a regular supply every day from local chippy Scotts.

Just look at me now: Inowashi the Steller's sea eagle perches on the corner of a picnic table after her feast of fried fish, which she has daily from Scott's fish and chip shop in Helmsley, North Yorkshire. And right, this is how she used to look as a tiny chick five years ago. She is being looked after by Charlie Heap at the International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire

Charlie Heap, who runs the bird of prey centre, said: 'We are just around the corner from Scotts so thought I would be cheeky and ask if they might consider donating fish to us on a regular basis.

'With an estimated 5,000 pairs in the world, Steller’s sea eagles are very rare, therefore we have to look after Inowashi very carefully indeed.

'She is a fussy eater, but she can’t get enough of the fish that the shop supply. Inowashi is now probably the best fed Steller’s sea eagle in the world.'

The bird has been at the International Centre for Birds of Prey since it opened last year, and takes part in thrice-daily flying displays.

Steller’s Sea-eagle is the biggest bird in the genus Haliaeetus and is one of the largest raptors overall.

Tony
 Webster, who owns Scotts, of Helmsley, said: 'We are delighted to help 
Charlie by supplying the centre with fish we can’t use.

Scott's fish and chip shop, in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, has been doing a roaring trade thanks to Inowashi the Steller's sea eagle's appetite for the traditional British supper. The eagle, which has a massive 8ft wingspan, has become one of Britain's biggest and is one of the rarest species in the world

A bit peckish: Inowashi the eagle settles in to her favourite daily meal of fried fish from the local fish and chip shop in Helmsley, North Yorkshire. its huge yellow beak is primed to snap up some tasty scraps from the box at its home in the International Centre for Birds of Prey in Duncombe Park.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you: Inowashi the eagle dives in to a portion of fish and chips as she grips her fearsome talons around owner Charlie Heap's glove. The bird is one of the biggest in Britain and its species one of the rarest in the world

Charlie Heap and his huge eagle Inowashi sit side by side after enjoying some fish and chips together. The Steller's sea eagle, now one of the biggest in Britain, enjoys nothing better than the traditional English meal at his home in the International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park in Helmsley, North Yorkshire

'Whilst every chippy says they are ‘frying tonight’, we can boast that we are ‘flying’ every night too.

'Inowashi has now become our most regular customer. You can tell she loves the fish because she never leaves any scraps.'

Scotts has been presented with the National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF) Fish and Chip Quality Award - putting them in the top 2.5 per cent of chippy in the country.

The Steller’s Sea Eagle - Haliaeetus pelagicus - is a large bird of prey in the family Accipitridae.

It is an eagle that lives in coastal northeastern Asia and mainly preys on fish and water birds.

On average, it is the heaviest eagle in the world, at about 5 to 9 kilograms (11 to 20 lb).
