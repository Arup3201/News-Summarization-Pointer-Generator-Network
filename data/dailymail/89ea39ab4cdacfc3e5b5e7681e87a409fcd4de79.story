Tragic: Darrell Teal, 22, died after jumping 30 feet off a bridge named 'Devil's Bridge' into a river below

The family of a young man killed in a deadly game of 'tombstoning' said the tragedy would 'hammer home' the dangers of the extreme sport.

Darrell Teal, 22, died after jumping 30 feet off a bridge named 'Devil’s Bridge' into a river below. It is thought he landed awkwardly as he hit the water and the alarm was raised when he did not resurface.

As police investigated the circumstances of the tragedy today, Mr Teal's relatives were being comforted at their home in Urmston, Greater Manchester.

His grandmother Sheila, 67, wept as 
she said: 'The whole family is devastated. We would like to hammer home 
the dangers of tombstoning - but we cannot at the moment as it is too 
soon and too raw for use to deal with at the moment.'

Father Shaun Teal, 45, said: 'My head’s just not with it at the moment after what happened. I’m struggling to deal with it now.'

Darrell
had travelled to the Lake District for the day with family and friends 
and some of the party had been jumping from Devil’s Bridge in Kirby 
Lonsdale into the river 30ft below.

The
14th Century bridge has been used for decades by people 'tombstoning' 
into the River Lune, but after several injuries over the years, signs 
have been erected warning people not to.

South Lakeland District Council passed a bylaw against jumping from the bridge over safety fears.

Cumbria
Police said the alarm was raised at 5pm and Darrell’s body was 
discovered further downstream from the bridge in Lune Lake at 1.30am on 
Sunday. He is not believed to have hit any rocks in the river.

A spokesman said: 'There are no 
suspicious circumstances surrounding the death at this time and the case
has been passed to the coroner.'

Steve
Sharrock, station manager at Kendal Fire Station said: 'We understand 
he had not hit any rocks but it is quite a height and witnesses said he 
may have hit the water at the wrong angle, in which case he could have 
knocked himself out.'

'We 
understand the man had travelled to the Lake District for the day with 
family and friends and was among a group of lads in their 20s who had 
been in the water.

'Sadly, 
despite the warning signs, there have been incidents at this bridge for 
the last 30 years or so where people have jumped off and hurt 
themselves, or worse.'

Two other young men wrapped in towels were seen being comforted at the scene after the alert was raised at 5pm last night.

Locals
are used to people injuring themselves leaping into the River Lune 
because the limestone formation beneath the bridge creates a 
fast-flowing current with water only deep in a small area.

Allan Muirhead, 
head of Kirkby Lonsdale Town Council, described the English Heritage site as having  a 'lethal cocktail of sunshine and water.'Mr Muirhead said that young men see 
jumping off the bridge as a 'rite of passage' and that those from 
outside the area did not appreciate the dangers.

Warning: The sign on Devil' Bridge advising tourists that it is an offence to jump into the river

He said: 'Unfortunately 
Devil’s Bridge is a kind of challenge. I’m not implying this is what this guy did, but a lot of 
people see it as an area to come to and if it’s at a certain depth they 
think they can jump off.

'If someone does decide to jump they can hit the wrong point. I was told that he went into the water badly.

'It
is regrettable that accidents like this do happen, fairly frequently, 
despite warnings and signs being put up. It’s a fairly safe environment 
but it’s still dangerous river.

'It’s
a very sad event, we’ve had a lot of injuries before. It’s an area that
carries risk and we have the air ambulance out fairly frequently.'

The council cannot put up fencing or increase the height of the bridge walls because it is an ancient monument, he added.

Inspector
Rob Lampard, of Cumbria Police said: 'Jumping off bridges is dangerous,
even if it appears to be safe or if you've seen people do it. It's an 
inherently dangerous thing to do.'
