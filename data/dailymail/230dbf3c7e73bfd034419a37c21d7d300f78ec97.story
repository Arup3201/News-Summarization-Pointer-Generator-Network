Liverpool have appointed Alex Inglethorpe as the club's academy director, with overall responsibility for developing the club's young talent.

He replaces Frank McParland, the long-serving coach, who was sacked  in December 2013.

Inglethorpe arrived from Tottenham in November 2012 and was in charge of the Under 21 side until the end of the 2013-14 season.

Eye for talent:  Alex Inglethorpe has been tasked with developing and nurturing Liverpool's young players 

The former Spurs coach has been charged with ensuring that the style of play of the academy sides mirrors the first team's, and he has been instructed to use similar technical and tactical coaching methods as those employed by manager Brendan Rodgers.

Liverpool's chief executive officer, Ian Ayre, said: 'Liverpool's academy is known around the world for developing some of the best football talent over the last two decades.

'This new structure will help us build on the success we have achieved so far.

'Not only will we continue to produce outstanding players who uphold the club's values, we will ensure they have the best environment and work with best-in-class coaches and support staff.'

Master and apprentice: Inglethorpe will seek to emulate Rodgers style of play with the youth sides 

The Reds will be hoping to return to the glory days of the mid-1990s, when the club produced the likes of Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman and Michael Owen.

In recent years, Jon Flanagan has established himself in the first team, but others like Martin Kelly, who is set to sign for Crystal Palace, have had to leave to get regular football.

As part of Liverpool's reshuffle, coach Michael Beale, who worked alongside Inglethorpe last season, will take charge of the U21 team for the 2014-15 campaign.

Nick Marshall joins the club as head of academy football operations, having previously worked at Barnsley, Leeds United, Nottingham Forest, while Andrew Powlesland joins as the new head of academy business.
