More than 900 GP practices across the country use 0844 numbers despite official guidance from the Department of Health that they should not do so

The NHS has been censured for promoting hundreds of 0844 telephone numbers without explaining that users can be hit with rip-off charges of up to 41p a minute.

Critics say charging people to access the NHS flies in the face of the principle that its medical services should be free at the point of delivery.

However, hundreds of doctors of surgeries continue to use expensive 0844 numbers.

And now the NHS Choices website, which
describes itself as the ‘front door to the NHS’ has been found guilty 
of promoting these expensive GP numbers without spelling out the cost 
involved.

In a ruling 
published today, the Advertising Standards Authority says the NHS is 
guilty of misleading the public by failing to list the charges.

More
than 900 GP practices across the country use 0844 numbers despite 
official guidance from the Department of Health and the NHS hierarchy 
that they should not do so.

Callers
with a mobile can be charged up to 41p a minute to reach these numbers –
more than double the figure for a normal geographic number beginning 01
or 02.

Many people dialling
their local GP from a landline would get the call free under their call
package, however dialling an 0844 number can generate a charge of 5p a 
minute plus a 13p set-up fee.

Some of the income from the calls goes direct to the GP surgeries to subsidise the cost of their telephone systems.

The ASA was first told about the 
failure of the NHS Choices website to alert users to charges before 
Christmas.

The NHS subsequently promised to make changes, however it 
failed to do so and is still running the misleading information.

The
ruling is a victory for a consumer campaigner who asked not to be 
named. He said: ‘The main fault here lies with GP surgeries who I 
believe are in breach of their contracts and official guidance.

‘It is totally unacceptable to charge people in this way.’

Official backing: The NHS Choices website, which describes itself as the 'front door to the NHS' has been found guilty of promoting these expensive GP numbers without spelling out the cost involved

In its ruling, the ASA said: ‘We considered that the costs of calling the 0844 numbers should have been made clear on the website. 

'Because these costs were not clearly stated we concluded that the website was misleading. We told NHS Choices to include clear pricing information for the 0844 numbers.’

The British Medical Association said doctors are reviewing the use of 0844 numbers and are likely to drop them when existing contracts with their telephone service providers come to an end.
