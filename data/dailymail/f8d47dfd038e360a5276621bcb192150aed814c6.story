An ex-boyfriend of Anthony Weiner's sexting partner Sydney Leathers is claiming she is 'psychotic' and tried to ruin his life by calling the cops and trying to get him fired when he broke off their relationship.

Drew Hanley, 29, alleges Leathers was a mentally unstable drug abuser who took cocaine when they were together.

Mr Hanley, who says he dated Leathers between 2007 and 2008 when she was a mere teenager, had harsh words for his 23-year-old ex.

Hanley claims that Leathers was vindictive and tried to get him fired from his job when he broke up with her

'She's crazy! She's psychotic,' he told the National Enquirer.

'She nearly ruined my life.'

Leathers' publicist told the Enquirer that Mr Hanley's account of the one-year relationship is 'ridiculous.'

Mr Hanley claims that Leathers lived with with him and his brother in Indiana for several months when she wasn't getting along with her family.

That's when they started dating. But, he said, the relationship was fraught with difficulties.

'She would become depressed and lock herself in the bathroom and start cutting herself,' he said.

Mr Hanley, now 29 and happily married with a daughter, says Leathers needed psychological help - and claims she still does

Leathers admitted earlier this week that she was considering starring in a porn movie

'She was into doing a lot of drugs, especially cocaine.'

Mr Hanley claimed to the Enquirer that when he finally broke up with her, she tried to 'ruin his life.' She called his boss and tried to have him fired by claiming that he had threatened her.

She then called police and said that she was stalking him, he alleged.

'They realized it was false and dropped the case,' he said.

Mr Hanley said the married Weiner showed 'shockingly poor judgement' by engaging in an online relationship with Leathers.

Weiner has admitted to making mistakes by sexting with several women - even after he was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 over the same behavior.
