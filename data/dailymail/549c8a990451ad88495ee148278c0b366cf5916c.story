A fresh set of stunning photographs have emerged of the huge eruption of Mount Sangean Api - a large volcano in Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire'.

Holidaymakers and crew on board the Dunai Baru yacht got the surprise of a lifetime when the volcano erupted on Friday, sending ash spewing an estimated 12 miles into the sky.

Although the menacing ash cloud looks close enough to touch, the spectacular photographs were actually taken onboard a vessel near Sumbawa island - a full 10 miles away from the Mount Sangean Api on the uninhabited Sangean island.

Distance: Although the menacing ash cloud looks close enough to touch, the spectacular photographs were actually taken near Sumbawa island - a full 10 miles away from the Mount Sangean Api on the uninhabited Sangean island

The pictures were shot by Courtney Robba, 29, from Duxbury in Massachusetts, who is Director of 
Operations of Dunia Baru Adventures.

He and the rest of the holidaymakers were enjoying a 10-day cruise around Komodo National Park when the natural disaster unfolded in front of them.

At
 around 3.30pm local time the group noticed a colossal plume of smoke 
and ash belching into the sky.

'The eruption was eerily silent
 and we only knew about it because one of the Indonesian deck hands saw 
it and alerted everyone,' he said.

'As ash 
began to fall all guests were advised to remain indoors and when it was 
necessary for crew to be outside for operational reasons, they donned 
medical grade masks, ' he added.

Spread: The fallout of ash from Sangean Api has caused major disruptions to international flights. There is concern that delays may continue to be felt in Indonesia and across northern Australia for several days, such is the size the ash cloud

Scores of 
farmers who work but do not live on the island were ordered to leave and
 not return until the volcano has finished erupting, said Muhammad 
Hendrasto, head of Indonesia's National Volcanology Agency. There are 
not believed to have been any deaths or injuries as a result of the 
eruption.

However, the fallout of ash from Sangean Api has caused major disruptions to international flights in the area.

There is concern that flight delays may continue be felt in Indonesia and across northern Australia for several days, such is the size the ash cloud.

Volcanic ash could be hazardous to aircraft but the decision to cancel flights remains down to individual airlines.

From the air: An earlier set of photographs were taken by professional photographer Sofyan Efendi during a commercial flight from Bali to the fishing town of Labuan BajoÂ 

Eruption: The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes. The Sunda Islands sit inside Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire'. Since Sangiang Api's first recorded eruption in 1512, it is believed to have erupted a total of 20 times

Authorities
 have had Mount Sangiang Api - which means 'Mountain of Spirits' in 
Balinese - on high alert for almost a year, he told China's Xinhua news 
agency.

The
 volcano sits in Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire' - an area where a 
large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur in the basin of
 the Pacific Ocean.

It has 452 volcanoes - 75 per cent of the world's 
total.

Since Sangiang Api's first recorded eruption in 1512, it is believed to have erupted a total of 20 times.
