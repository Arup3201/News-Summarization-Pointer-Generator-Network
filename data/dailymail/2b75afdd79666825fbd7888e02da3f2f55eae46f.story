Rafael dos Anjos stunned UFC lightweight champion Anthony Pettis with a dominant performance to become the first Brazilian to win the 155lb title.

All three judges scored the fight 50-45 to dos Anjos who started aggressively and never slowed down as Pettis was left unable to see out of his right eye.

Earlier, strawweight Joanna Jedrzejczyk was crowned Europe's first female champion when she stopped Carla Esparza in the second round.

'Everything went perfect during the fight,' dos Anjos said. 'Our strategy was hit hard and make him afraid of my punch and my hands.'

The 30-year-old fought with a knee injury picked up in training three weeks prior to the fight and will now undergo an MRI scan.

Pettis rallied late in the fourth round, but it proved too little, too late.

'He hit me with a left. First punch he threw, I couldn't see out my right eye,' Pettis said. 

Undefeated Jedrzejczyk, meanwhile, looked impressive against Esparza.

The 27-year-old Pole backed the champion up against the Octagon with a flurry of punches before the referee stopped the scheduled five-round bout with less than a minute of the second session remaining..

'I knew I was going to win, but I didn't expect it would be in the second round,' Jedrzejczyk said. 'Every day I'm 100 per cent. That's why I'm here.

'Nobody going to take this belt from me.' 

'She did a great job,' Esparza said. 'There's never an excuse when you lose.'

Also on the UFC 185 card, Johny Hendricks returned to winning ways against Matt Brown.

Having lost his welterweight title to Robbie Lawler last December, Hendricks won by unanimous decision to remain on course for a chance to reclaim the title. 

British star Ross Pearson was also victorious, stunning Sam Stout with a second-round knockout after landing a left hook.

In the heavyweight division, Alistair Overeem won a unanimous decision against Roy Nelson.
