It started out as a simple disagreement between neighbours over when to open and shut a gate on their shared driveway.

But three years – and £100,000 later – the two middle-class couples have been criticised by a judge after their quarrel, which could have been solved for about £5,000, ended up as a bitter feud in court.

Mr Justice Norris said he was surprised that retired construction firm director Peter Heslin, 73, and his wife, Marianne, 67, and retired teachers Martin and Rosemary Bradley had been unable to sit around a table and work out a solution.

'Prisoners in our own home': Peter and Marianne Helsin said that they didn't want to 'roll over' because giving the Bradleys control of their £650,000 five-bedroom property would be make it difficult to sell in the future

Instead they had spent what Mr Heslin called a ‘sickening’ amount paying lawyers to take the argument to court.

After a three-day hearing in Liverpool in May, the High Court judge in London yesterday ruled a partial victory for the Bradleys, who will be allowed to lock the gates on the driveway to their properties in Formby, Merseyside, between 11pm and 7.30am.

But he agreed with the Heslins that the most sensible answer – and much cheaper than legal action – would have been to install a set of electronic gates.

Mr Heslin last night said the whole dispute had left him feeling ill. ‘We’ve spent a sickening amount of money on this and the Bradleys have too, but once the legal machine is rolling it’s impossible to get off without giving in,’ he said. 

‘We’re determined to fight until a judge finally sees through the claptrap and orders for electronic gates to be installed.

‘That has been the obvious solution all along, but for some reason the Bradleys have refused point blank to have them.

Lawyers: Retired teacher Martin Bradley and his wife Rosemary instructed solicitors after Mr Heslin padlocked one of the gates permanently open 

‘A set of electronic gates would have cost around £5,000, but with the amount we’ve already spent we could have had a pair of gold-plated gates by now.’

Mr Heslin said they didn’t want to ‘roll over’ because giving the Bradleys control of access to their £650,000 five-bedroom property would make it difficult to sell in future.

He added: ‘Forcing the gates to be shut at night is a partial victory for them. We do feel like prisoners in our own home.’ Problems began in August 2011 when the Bradleys, who have lived in an elegant £700,000 Edwardian villa for 28 years, began routinely shutting the front gate for security reasons following a break-in at a neighbouring property.

The Heslins’ home, which sits directly behind the Bradleys’ back garden and swimming pool, can only be accessed by a driveway down the side via a shared set of 4ft-wide wrought iron gates.

They claimed that shutting the gates to their property, which they have owned since 2006, was inconvenient and dangerous because they would have to stop and park the car at the roadside each time they came home.

Mr Heslin claims he spoke to Mr Bradley, 67, who agreed to look into getting a quote for electronic gates. But he said the Bradleys took umbrage when, in December 2011, after months of inaction, the Heslins got a quote themselves.

Things came to a head in August 2012 when, following no further progress, Mr Heslin padlocked one of the gates permanently open. This was the last time either couple spoke to each other and led to the Bradleys instructing solicitors.

Mrs Heslin said: ‘We offered to pay for electronic gates in full but they just won’t have it.’

She said the Bradleys had offered one objection after another to electronic gates, including fears that children would destroy post left in a mail box outside. She added: ‘Now I think it’s all about saving face.’

The judge said: ‘Sensible neighbours would have sat round a table and worked out either a regime for closing the gates at agreed hours or the installation of remotely-operated electric gates.’

Last night the Bradleys were unavailable for comment.
