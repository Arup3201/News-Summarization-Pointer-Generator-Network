FIFA are diseased and corrupt. These monsters always get away with it... 

The FIFA World Cup corruption saga took another twist on Tuesday night when football’s world governing body lodged a criminal complaint in Switzerland over the misconduct of certain unnamed individuals.

It follows the recommendation of ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert to FIFA president Sepp Blatter that the shadowy international transfer of assets to Switzerland in isolated cases was serious enough to be reported to the Office of the Attorney General in Bern.

The decision by Eckert, chairman of FIFA’s ethics adjudicatory chamber, comes less than a week after his summary of colleague Michael Garcia’s investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes, which took nearly two years, was widely discredited as a ‘whitewash’.

The report was also disowned by Garcia, who is taking his case of misrepresentation to the FIFA appeals committee.

Eckert’s conclusions ridiculously apportioned a lot of the blame to England’s doomed 2018 bid that gleaned only two votes. 

But there was no suggestion even in his skewed findings that England’s bid team had illegally transferred assets into Switzerland.

And although FIFA would not speculate, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the criminal complaints allegedly involve FIFA’s two former executive committee rogues - Jack Warner and Mohamed Bin Hammam.

Both are outside football’s jurisdiction with Warner, almost omnipresent in incidents of World Cup bid-related corruption, having resigned all his positions in the game and Bin Hammam having been banned for life after his cash-for-votes attempt to bribe his way to the FIFA presidency.

Eckert also reiterated, to FIFA’s website, that Russia and Qatar are clear to host the next two World Cups, adding ‘there was insufficient clear evidence of illegal or irregular conduct that would call into question the integrity of the award process’.

The fall-out has been extensive since FIFA on Thursday published a report investigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

Here are the events since the release of a 42-page report by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's independent ethics committee, in his ruling on Michael Garcia's investigation.

NOVEMBER 12, 2014

FIFA announces the initial findings of the investigation into the bidding process for the next two World Cups will be published on Thursday morning, with England expected to come in for some criticism for the attempt to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner.

NOVEMBER 13

England are indeed condemned for rules violations in their bid for the 2018 tournament, but Russia and Qatar are effectively confirmed as hosts for 2018 and 2022 respectively, the report stating any rule breaches by them were 'of very limited scope'. The Football Association rejects 'any criticism' of England's bid, with a spokesman saying: 'We conducted a transparent bid and, as the report demonstrates with its reference to the England bid team's 'full and valuable co-operation', willingly complied with the investigation.'

FIFA's chief ethics investigator Garcia announces he will appeal against the findings, saying the report contains 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions' in his original report.

NOVEMBER 14

Eckert admits his 'surprise' at Garcia's plans to appeal and adds: 'I will talk to Garcia but until then I will make no more statements.'

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claims it is 'grossly unfair' for England to have borne the brunt of criticism and adds: 'The Garcia report should be out there in full.'

American FIFA member Sunil Gulati and FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb from the Cayman Islands issue a joint statement also calling for Garcia's report to be published in full.

FIFA confirms receipt of Garcia's intention to appeal.

NOVEMBER 16

Former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson claims FIFA ran a 'Wild West' bidding process for the two tournaments which encouraged would-be hosts to enter into inappropriate behaviour.

NOVEMBER 17

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke writes to FIFA executive committee members calling for 'urgent action' to ensure Garcia's report is published in full, claiming public confidence in FIFA has hit a new low and that there is 'compelling evidence' of wrongdoing.

Phaedra Almajid and Bonita Mersiades, members of the Qatar and Australia 2022 bid teams respectively and key whistleblowers in the original corruption allegations, register separate complaints against Eckert claiming his report breached promises of confidentiality. Almajid's statement labels Eckert's report 'a crude, cynical and fundamentally erroneous description of me and the information and materials I provided the investigation'.

Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein urges European nations to boycott the 2018 World Cup unless FIFA undergoes serious reform - including Sepp Blatter not standing for re-election as president.

NOVEMBER 18

FIFA lodges a criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general over 'possible misconduct' by individuals in connection with the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The move follows a recommendation by FIFA's ethics judge Eckert as part of his findings into the Garcia investigation on World Cup bidding.

FIFA president Blatter has insisted however that the lodging of the criminal complaint does not affect Eckert's statement last week that the investigation into the bidding process for the two World Cups is concluded.
