A sea anemone is a tame, plant-like animal that leads a rather boring, slow life at the bottom of oceans or in tidal pools.

That is, until a seabird falls into its mouth.

And that’s just what happened in this remarkable set of images that shows a young bird in up to its neck inside one of these water predators.

Here a baby seabird is seen upside down underwater in a Giant Green Anemone having presumably fallen in either from the talons of another bird or from a nest. The bird was thought to have been dead for about two days when it was found in the tidal pool in Cannon Beach, Oregon

In the image, a baby bird of the cormorant species is seen upside down in a tidal pool in Cannon Beach, Oregon.

Sea anemones are a group of water-dwelling, predatory animals classified in the phylum cnidaria.

The
 polyps stick to the sea floor with an adhesive foot called a basal disk
 and have a column-shaped body ending in an 'oral disk'.

Most measure 0.6 to 1.2 inches (1.5 to three centimetres) in diameter, but some measuring up to 6.5 feet (two metres) have been found.

They can have up to a few hundred tentacles.

The
 creature's mouth is in the middle of its 'oral disk' and is surrounded 
by tentacles with cells on them that protect the creatures as well as 
let them catch prey.

Some of the animals can sting and inject venom into prey such as small fish and shrimp.

The
 venom is a mixture of toxins that paralyses the prey so it can be moved
 to the anemone's mouth for digestion inside its 'gastrovascular 
cavity,' which functions like a stomach.

Sea anemones are related to corals and jellyfish.

Around its neck can be seen a Giant Green Anemone, a common invertebrate.

In the middle of the anemone is the mouth, which doubles up as an anus, out of which the bird is sticking.

When prey enters the mouth of a sea anemone, a tiny venom-carrying dart shoots out.

This kills or stuns the prey, normally fish and shrimp, and allows the sea anemone to chow down slowly but surely on its meal.

And in this case it seems the poor bird has been subjected to the full might of the sea anemone.

The researchers estimate it was a baby bird as it was too young to have significant plumage, as seen by the balding areas on it.

'Cormorant chicks are featherless at hatching and usually have natal down by 10 days post-hatch,' the researchers write.

They also note it was in a state of rigor mortis without noticeable decay or evidence of scavenging.

The event occurred in a tidal pool at Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach, Oregon

Exactly how the bird came to be in the water-dweller’s mouth is unknown.

The researchers says it’s possible that a Bald Eagle dropped the chick, or it could have simply fallen from its nest.

Whether the bird was dead before it fell into anemone as well is up for debate.

The researchers say it had been dead for no more than two days, owing to a lack of scavenging by other animals.

Events like this are incredibly rare, especially given that sea anemone's are slow-moving animals, and it is only by chance such a situation can occur. When prey falls into the mouth of an anemone, which doubles as its anus, it fires a venomous dart that knocks out or kills its victim

And, before further observations could be made, the tide pool filled with sand the following day and buried the anemone.

The event itself is incredibly rare - similar finds made in 2003 and 2007 at the same location are among few known instances of this occurrence.

The event occurred last year in Cannon Beach, Oregon, but was only recently explained in a paper in the journal Marine Ornithology.
