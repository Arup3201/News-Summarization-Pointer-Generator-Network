The chief executive of Longleat Safari Park has been mysteriously suspended - and all the locks have been inexplicably changed.

David Bradley was headhunted to lead the renowned wildlife attraction in Wiltshire - the first safari park outside Africa - four years ago.

But today officials confirmed he has been ousted while 'an investigation' is carried out.

Suspended: David Bradley, who was headhunted by the Viscount of Weymouth to run the park, is 'under review'

High profile: The park in Warminster, Wiltshire, welcomes thousands of visitors every year to see the wildlife

Developing: Mr Bradley was four years into a five-year development project that included a Monkey Temple

Mr Bradley, a former managing director of Legoland, was brought in by Viscount Weymouth, the son of Longleat estate owner Lord Bath, in 2009.

Tasked with bringing the park into the 21st century, Mr Bradley embarked on an ambitious five-year investment and development plan.

It involved several new visitor attractions including a Â£2million 'Jungle Kingdom', a monkey temple, and two luxury leisure complexes - the Bishopstrow Hotel and Spa in Wiltshire and Homewood Park Hotela nd Spa in Bath.

A Longleat spokesman said: 'David Bradley has been temporarily suspended from Longleat and we are currently carrying out a review.

The park has been awash with attention since it launched as the first safari park outside Africa in 1966

From the start, it has housed wild animals native to Africa such as lions, giraffes, gorillas and cheetahs

'We are unable to comment further on any claims as it would be unfair to those involved.'

Longleat,
which covers 9,000 acres of the Warminster countryside, became the 
first safari park outside Africa when it opened in 1966.

It now has over 500 animals, including lions, cheetahs and monkeys.

Visitors come to see the park and to look around Longleat House, home of the 7th Marquess of Bath, Alexander Thynn. The infamous aristocrat, 81, has had 75 'wifelets', some of whom have lived in cottages on his estate

The bedroom is decorated with Karma Sutra pictures - an attraction in itself for the park's visitors

The dining room has an S-shaped table that seats at least 26 people, and original paintings on the walls

Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the estate every year to see the wildlife and look round the mansion belonging to Alexander Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath.

Lord Bath, the so-called 'Loins of Longleat', decorated his bedroom with Kama Sutra paintings.

Visitors can also see the cottages dotted round the grounds where the bearded lothario peer is said to have housed dozens of 'wifelet' mistresses.
