Just when you thought Andrea Pirlo couldn't appear more laid-back the Italy star hits the beach in Ibiza for some quality time with his children.

The 35-year-old midfield maestro is taking a break in Spain ahead of joining Juventus as they prepare to defend their Serie A title.

Pirlo, who played his final games for his country in Brazil, is easily recognisable with his distinctive beard but was more than happy to pose for photographs with fans on the beach and even in the surf.

Once he rejoins his club this month 
they will be pushing for a fourth consective Serie A championship after 
winning last season with a record 102 points.

Pirlo's
 habit of success at Juventus - with titles in 2011–12, 2012–13 and 
2013–14 coinciding with his arrival frmo AC Milan - couldn't rub off on 
Italy at the World Cup.

Nor
 could his announcement that he would retire from international football
 at the conclusion of the tournament inspire his team-mates as they left
 at the first hurdle.

The
 only solace they could take away was that they finished above England 
courtesy of their only victory, a 2-1 result in their opening match with
 Claudio Marchisio and Mario Balotelli cancelling out Daniel Sturridge's
 effort.

Just before the World Cup, Pirlo confirmed a two-year extention with Juventus that would take him through to 2016.
