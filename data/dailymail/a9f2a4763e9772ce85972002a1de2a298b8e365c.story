It was a time of great change as Britain had finally shed its post-war austerity and looked forward with a new confidence and prosperity. These photographs, taken around London in 1964, show a city and a country undergoing a dramatic transformation.

The year was one of major upheaval in British history. National Service had been abolished in 1960 but the final troops involved on their compulsory military tour of duty were not sent home until the end of December 1963.

Unlike their fathers and grandfathers, teenagers in 1964 were not facing the prospect of a European war and increasing living standards allowed them a disposable income.

January 1964 saw the first broadcast of a revolutionary new music show on the BBC, Top of the Pops. It represented the start of a cultural shift with British acts heading across to the United States and topping the charts.

For these young people, recently dubbed teenagers, Bob Dylan 
described the situation pretty accurately when he sang 'The Times They 
Are A-Changin', released in January 1964.

In
 Britain, the Conservative government of Alec Douglas Home was replaced 
by Labour's Harold Wilson, who promised to bring the country into the 'white heat'
 of the technical revolution, winning with a majority of just four seats. 

It was the year that the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, the Rolling Stones launched their eponymous debut album and the Kinks from Muswell Hill had the hit 'You Really Got Me'.

In
 London, the culture of the city was changing rapidly, less than a 
generation after the first immigrants aboard the Empire Windrush arrived
 on Tilbury Docks.

Areas
 such as Brixton had become very popular with some of the immigrant 
communities, while across in Notting Hill, the first August bank-holiday
 carnival was held. It now regularly attracts more than two million 
visitors to the city but in 1964, just 500 people are thought to have 
attended.

The new communities brought with them a new culture, music and cuisine, but official moves were being made to restrict the numbers of 
people coming from the former colonies with a succession of Commonwealth
 Immigration Acts. But as these photographs show, the cultural make up of Britain was changing for ever.

Among the major developments in 1964, it was the year that Britain finally abolished the death penalty although on August 13, 1964 Gwynne Owen Evans and Peter Anthony Allen were executed for the robbery an murder of John Alan West on April 7, 1964.

As plans were being made to abolish the death penalty, Moors Murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were in the middle of their killing spree.

Meanwhile, the large number of 
immigrants moving to Britain from the Commonwealth caused some concern 
and led to a succession of restrictions being imposed, particularly due 
to the political instability of some former colonies such as Kenya.

Some
 politicians feared that without restrictions large numbers of 
Commonwealth citizens would move and settle in Britain for a better 
life.

But it was not just the young children at school who began mixing. The new immigrants brought their own culture with them and opened venues, such this underground club in Cable Street in London's East End

In 1964, young couples looking for a new home could look at the average house for £3,360. At the time the average wage was £18 a year meaning that a house was only three-and-a-half times the annual wage of £960. Interest rates during the period were 5.5 per cent.

If the price of a house seemed reasonable, then a loaf of bread was a positive bargain at the cost of just 5p while a football fan would buy a season ticket for about £8.50. The pre-match pint would only cost between 8-10p in 1964. 

In the cinema, Sergio Leone reinvented the western with A Fistful of Dollars and a brooding Clint Eastwood, while Michael Caine starred in Zulu. Sean Connery returned as James Bond in Goldfinger while Stanley Kubrick mocked the spy thriller genre with Dr Strangelove.

Musical fans in 1964 had a few highlights as well with Mary Poppins and My Fair Lady.

Internationally, Jack Ruby is sentenced to death for murdering Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated US President John F Kennedy. Ruby's conviction is later overturned and he dies before he can be tried a second time. The Warren Commission rules that Oswald acted alone when he murdered the president.

The United States was getting more heavily involved in the Vietnam War and in South Africa, Nelson Mandela is sentenced to life in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime.

Malta also declared independence from Britain in 1964.

1964 was also the year with the Forth Road bridge was completed and considered a major engineering triumph.

The British and French government signed an agreement in 1964 that a tunnel should be built between England and France and it should be completed by the end of the decade.
