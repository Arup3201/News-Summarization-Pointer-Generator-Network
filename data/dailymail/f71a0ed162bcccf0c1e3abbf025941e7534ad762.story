Standing in front of a blue wall with beaming smiles, they appear relaxed, untroubled and happy.

But these 32 men and women have been arrested on suspicion of being part of a multimillion-dollar scheme to grow massive quantities of marijuana illegally in Colorado and smuggle it out of state.

The suspects, aged 25 to 71, were rounded up following an investigation that authorities have called 'Colorado's largest marijuana bust' since the drug was  legalized for medical use in November 2000.

They allegedly posed as medical marijuana patient caregivers and small business owners over a four-year period while trafficking tens of thousands of pounds of pot out of state, according to 9 News.

Grinning: They are among 32 suspects - two more of whom are pictured above - to have been rounded up following an investigation that authorities have called 'Colorado's largest marijuana bust' since 2000

Accused: The suspects allegedly posed as medical marijuana patient caregivers and small business owners over a four-year period while trafficking tens of thousands of pounds of pot out of state, it is reported

Smiling for the camera: They are believed to have netted more than a huge $12million in total by smuggling heaps of marijuana trim, concentrate, and butane hash to Texas, Minnesota and other states, it is said

They are believed to have netted more than a whopping $12million in total by smuggling heaps of marijuana trim, concentrate, and butane hash to Texas, Minnesota and other states, it is said.

During the Denver-based inquiry, 4,600 pounds of pot, 2,000 plants and 10 pounds of hash oil were seized by police, the Houston Chronicle reported. Almost $1.5million in cash was also recovered.  

This month, Colorado authorities won indictments against the 32 suspects, including Tri Trong Nguyen, his wife, his three sisters and dozens of others. Each is now facing 52 felony counts.

In a statement Thursday, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman said the inquiry had 'shut down one of the largest and most sophisticated criminal enterprises uncovered' since the 2000 law passage.

Coffman added: 'Nguyen’s drug ring is further evidence of Colorado’s thriving black market. Illegal drug dealers are simply hiding in plain sight, attempting to use the legalized market as a cover.'

During the investigation, police uncovered evidence allegedly showing that skydiving instructor Joseph Johnson - who is one of those arrested - had utilized his plane to ship marijuana out of Colorado.

Johnson, who owns Westside Skydiving in Winsted, Minnesota, reportedly flew more than 1,500 pounds of pot and over $2million in cash to the state in his role as a 'go-fer', according to CBS.

The instructor was caught while driving 60 pounds of marijuana and hundreds of thousand of dollars back to Colorado after flying to Houston, Texas, to allegedly expand sales, it is reported.

In its statement, the Attorney General's Office said: 'In an arrangement with Nguyen, marijuana was harvested, packaged, and then shipped from Boulder to Minnesota aboard Johnson’s planes.'

During the ring’s operation, Nguyen controlled the illegal cultivation and distribution of marijuana at 13 warehouses throughout Denver, with the help of his wife, Kristine Root, according to police.

Root, alongside Nguyan's sisters Josie Phuong Farrow, Shelia Thi Kieu Lorenz, and Oanh Tran, are accused of laundering the proceeds from the marijuana and deliberately avoiding paying taxes.

Right, Ryan Farrow was also arrested by Denver police

Complaint: The Attorney General’s Office launched an investigation into the alleged marijuana ring after police discovered an 'unlicensed marijuana grow warehouse' in January 2014 following a citizen complaint

More solemn: Josie Farrow (left) and 71-year-old Alicia Rainey (right) were also allegedly part of the scheme

Small smiles: Antonio Orfei (left) and Aaron Ellering (right) barely managed smiles in their police mug shots

They allegedly 'disguised their criminal activity through front companies that included a massage parlor' and a purported property management firm leasing space to marijuana growers. 

They converted cash from their sales 'into money orders that they then deposited into bank accounts in amounts under $3,000 to avoid triggering federal reporting requirements,' the statement said.

'We are grateful to our state and federal partners who we worked with on the ‘Operation Golden Go-fer’ investigation,' said Denver Police Chief Robert White following the 32 suspects' arrests. 

He added: 'These partnerships and investigations go a long way to send the message to criminals who think the Denver area is the place to setup illegal marijuana operations.

John Magee (left) and James Averette (right) are each facing 52 felony counts for their roles in the 'scheme'

'The Denver Police Department has a unit of dedicated detectives whose main objective is to stop illegal marijuana operations in our city and Denver does not tolerate these crimes in our city.' 

And Anh Thi Nguyen, 37, Jason Joyner, 28, James Chad Averette, 28, Tiffany Gille, 34, Everett Grove, 25, Adam Tilley, 28, Anthony Smith, 27, Matthew Olson, 40, and 34-year-old Jordan Iovinella have also been accused of being part of the marijuana ring, Twincities.com reported. 

On Friday, Colorado argued in a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court that states are free to legalize marijuana following a lawsuit from neighboring states asking the court to shut down its pot law.

The filing marks the first time Colorado has defended legal marijuana in writing. The federal government did not sue to block the state's 2012 vote to legalize pot for all adults over 21.

Colorado said that Nebraska and Oklahoma should sue the federal government for not enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, not other states. Colorado said the states' 'quarrel is not with Colorado but with the federal government's' approach to letting states experiment with pot law.

'Nebraska and Oklahoma filed this case in an attempt to reach across their borders and selectively invalidate state laws with which they disagree,' Colorado argued.

Because federal drug law bans marijuana for any purpose, including medical, Colorado argues that blocking recreational pot would also block pot for medical use in 23 states and Washington, D.C. 

The court has not said whether it will hear the challenge. It has no deadline for doing so. 

The 32 suspects' charges include violating the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act, illegal marijuana distribution, money laundering, tax evasion, and attempts to influence public servants.

They are all now awaiting trial dates in Denver District Court.
