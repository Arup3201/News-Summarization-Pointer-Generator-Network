Wales prop Adam Jones has rejected a contract offer from the Ospreys and has signed for their regional rivals Cardiff Blues.

Jones' agents Big Red Management confirmed Jones' move on their Twitter account, accompanied by a picture of the player.

'All parties delighted that @adamjones3 has signed with @cardiff-blues,' they tweeted.

Although the Blues have not formally confirmed 33-year-old Jones' arrival, he was included on a photograph of next season's squad that was published on the Blues' official Twitter feed on Tuesday.

Jones had also been linked to following Wales captain - and new Blues team-mate Sam Warburton - in signing a Welsh Rugby Union central contact, but the Blues have now secured his services on what is thought to be a one-year deal.

Confirming that Jones had told them he would not be re-signing at the Liberty Stadium - his contract expired at the end of last season - the Ospreys said they were 'disappointed' with the outcome.

Jones made his Wales debut in 2003 and has been part of three Six Nations Grand Slam-winning teams. He also featured in three World Cup campaigns.

'This is about a new challenge for me,' Jones said.

'At this stage in my career I want a new environment and to really push myself.

'I've been really impressed by the set-up at the Blues and the desire to achieve in the coming years under the leadership of (director of rugby) Mark Hammett. It is that ambition and potential for the future that excites me about this move.

'Obviously, I would like to thank everyone at the Ospreys - from the players and coaches to the wonderful supporters - who have been absolutely fantastic with me. I wish the region every success for the future.'
