Hundreds of grief-stricken mourners came together Saturday in Minneapolis to say a final farewell to five young children who were killed in a house fire two weeks ago.

Colorful butterfly wings were affixed to each of the five small coffins carrying the bodies of Christopher, 8, Mary, 6, Fannie, 4, Troy, 3, and 18-month-old Gwendolyn.

The kids' father, Troy Lewis, was able to rescue 9-year-old Shaca and 5-year-old Electra from their burning duplex; both children remain in a hospital, but are said to be on the road to recovery.

Mr Lewis, 60, dressed all in black, wept as he touched the plain white caskets bearing the photos of his dead children on the side, each topped with an arrangement of red roses. 

Troy Lewis was joined at Shiloh Temple Church Saturday by 200 relatives, friends and supporters, including Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, School Superintendent Bernadeia Johnson and Fire Chief John Fruetel.

The Lewis family had already been dealing with the death of their mother, Kim Davis, 31, who passed away last fall. While the tragedy still hurts, there was some peace and comfort felt amid the tears.

‘It meant to me that I was sending my children home to their mother and to a better place,’ Troy Lewis said, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

The nearly two-hour funeral service ended with family members embracing one another and the children’s caskets.

‘Our hearts are exploding. ... There are no words to describe how we feel right now,’ said Lewis' sister, Debra Lewis, of Chicago. ‘How hard it is for my brother to have his five beautiful angels in front of him.’

Final touch: Mr Lewis wept as he caressed Gwendolyn's small coffin, but he was able to find some solace in the tjought that his children have joined their mother in heaven

Investigators still have not determined the cause of the fire but have said a space heater had been running for days and was located where the fire appears to have started.

‘You were there that morning, and we know you tried (to save them),’ Miss Lewis told her brother. ‘Now we have to stand fast.’

Troy Lewis revealed that the two children who did survive the February fire continue to heal both physically and emotionally.

‘One of my daughters is in shock, she just don't [sic] want to talk about it,’ Lewis said.

In a rare moment of levity, Mr Lewis joked that one of the girls asked for McDoland’s food and the other requested M&Ms.

Speaking from his hospital bed just days after the fire, Mr Lewis tearfully described how he had to choose which of his seven children to save from the flames. 

'I wanted to get all of my babies,' Lewis told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'All of my babies. I wanted all my babies.'

Blaze: Lewis managed to save two of his seven children before the flames, pictured, became too much

The
 fire broke out around 4.30am February 14 on the top floor of the duplex. According 
to the building's landlord, Lewis and his children had been living there
 for the past six or eight months. The children's mother died in November from cancer.

Lewis had to jump out of his second-story window to escape the blaze. He injured his back in the fall, but went right back into the house to save his children.

First he grabbed Shaca who was gasping for air. Then he went for 8-year-old Christopher, but found his son already dead.

'He was dead,' Lewis told the Star Tribune. 'I saw him burned. I saw my baby burn.'

Two
 other children shared a bedroom with Christopher, 5-year-old Fannie and
 3-year-old Troy, so Lewis moved on to look for the other kids knowing 
those two children didn't make it.

Cause: Authorities say the fire started on the second floor, and likely was caused by a space heater

'I had a choice to make, a dead child here or...a live one,' Lewis said.

After rescuing Shaca and Electra, Lewis again attempted to get back into the house but by then it was engulfed in flames.

'I ran back upstairs to get the third child, that's when I stopped. I couldn't do it no more. Out of seven, I have two. I have to be strong for them,' Lewis told WCCO.

'All I can say is that they were beautiful children,' Lewis added. Should have never moved into that house.'

Landlord Paul Bertelson’s company identifies distressed
 or foreclosed properties, refurbishes them and rents to low-income 
families. He said the 102-year-old duplex had smoke and carbon monoxide 
detectors. The upper unit is heated by permanent baseboard units.

There were no current code violations on the duplex where 15 people lived.

Neighbors say the second and third floors of the home were occupied by a man and his seven children ranging in age from 1 to 9

Minneapolis Fire Chief Fruetel said three children died at the scene. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed the two additional deaths but did not release any information about the victims.

Fruetel said firefighters encountered heavy smoke and fire on the second and third floors of the duplex as they searched for victims and survivors. It took firefighters about 2½ hours to put out the blaze.

He said the building was up to code and smoke detectors were hard-wired and appeared to be working. He said he didn’t know if the smoke detectors went off before this fire.

Gov. Mark Dayton issued a statement offering condolences to the family and friends of the victims, and thanking firefighters and other first responders 'whose heroism saved lives this morning.'

City records show an inspection report last summer called for repairs to smoke detectors in the unit, among other violations. City spokesman Matt Laible said all of the violations were taken care of and that the unit’s rental license was renewed just a week ago.
