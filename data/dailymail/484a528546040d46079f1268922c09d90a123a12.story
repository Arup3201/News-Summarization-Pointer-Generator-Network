This is the language map of England which reveals the parts of the country where as many as two in five people do not have English as their mother tongue.

New data shows the proportion of people across who say English is not their main language  ranging from 0.7 per cent in Redcar and Cleveland to 41.4 per cent in Newham in London.

The breakdown from the 2011 national census also revealed the second most commonly  spoken language in the country is now Polish.

New data shows the proportion of people across England who say English is not their main language, ranging from 0.7 per cent in Redcar and Cleveland to 41.4 per cent in Newham

The data showed that there are 546,174 people 
in England and Wales who say Polish is their main language and that 
Welsh – long the second language in the UK – is spoken by 562,000 
people.

When Scotland and 
Northern Ireland publish their census  findings, their newcomers from 
Poland are bound to push the total for the whole of the UK above the 
number of Welsh speakers.

Polish was virtually unheard on the 
streets of Britain a decade ago but its use has soared since the country
 joined the EU in May 2004.

The Labour government of that period 
estimated that only 13,000 Poles a year would come to the UK, but 
between December 2003 and December 2010 the number living in the UK 
increased from 75,000 to 532,000.

Immigration from Poland was at its 
highest in 2007 when 96,000 entered the UK. Nearly a quarter of all 
Polish citizens in Britain live in London.

Some 148,000 now live in the capital, two per cent of its population.

There are also high concentrations of 
Polish speakers in small towns across Britain, particularly those in 
Eastern England with agricultural industries.

Boston, the Lincolnshire town at the 
heart of a row over immigration on BBC1’s Question Time last  week, had 
3,006 people who speak Polish as a main language out of 62,243 
residents, roughly one person in 20.

The town attracted attention after 
Cambridge academic Mary Beard told the studio audience in Lincoln that 
local fears over immigration were a ‘myth’ and that ‘public services can
 cope’.

She was rebuked by businesswoman Rachel Bull, a descendant of Polish grandparents, who said services were at ‘breaking point’.

London had the most people using a foreign tongue. This graph shows the top five most reported main languages other than English (or Welsh in Wales)

The new Census data revealed 100 different languages spoken across the country, from the well-known to the almost forgotten.

Just 33 people gave their main language as Manx Gaelic, the ancient language of the Isle of Man which was officially recored as extinct in 1974.

Elsewhere 58 people said Scottish Gaelic, 557 people said Cornish, 510 said Caribbean Creole and 461 listed gypsy/traveller languages.

French was the main language of 147,099, Portugese 133,453, Spanish 120,222 and German 77,240.

Amid a growing row over the number of eastern Europeans likely to come to Britain when visa limits are lifted, 38,946 said Bulgarian was their mother tongue and 67,586 said Romanian.

The census figures show that other 
Eastern European languages are  now in the list of the most popular, 
including Lithuanian, spoken by 85,000 people, and Latvian, first  
language of 32,000.

Romanian and Bulgarian are other 
languages that can be heard – a year before citizens of Romania and  
Bulgaria are allowed access to the UK  in the same way they have been to
 Poles since 2004.

Romanian is the first language of 68,000 people in England and Wales, and Bulgarian of 38,000 people.

The greatest number of languages is 
spoken in London, where more than 100 different ones are used in every 
borough but three.

Among those reported were Danish, Caribbean Creole, 
Gypsy or traveller language, Nepalese, Pashto and Malayalam.

The census also found that claims made of languages sometimes said to be widely spoken and culturally important were overblown.

Just 557 people said they spoke  
Cornish as a first language last year.  Even more rare were Gaelic 
Scottish, which had 58 speakers, and Manx Gaelic, 33.

Last year a report by the Welsh 
Language Board said the number of fluent Welsh speakers is falling by 
around 3,000 people a year.

In all, four million people in England and Wales have a main language that is not English.

Among these, 726,000 said they do not speak English well and 138,000 speak no English at all.

Just under eight per cent of people in England and Wales said English was not their main language, rising to 22 per cent in London

The Census data revealed how the proportion of people who can speak Welsh has fallen in many parts of Wales between 2001 and 2011
