One million women worldwide will show their support for a brutally murdered Iraqi immigrant by posting pictures of themselves wearing hijab headscarves as part of a global campaign.

Muslim mother-of-five Shaima Alawadi was found beaten and unconscious in her San Diego home last month in an apparent killing which officials described as a 'hate crime'.

Now as a show of solidarity towards the female Islamic community, one million women - many of whom are non-Muslim - have posted photos of themselves wearing the traditional headscarf.

The campaign, 'One Million Hijabs for Shaima Alawadi', has seen women worldwide wear the Islamic headscarf to show support for the family and friends of Alawadi, who was found dead on March 21.

Alawadi's husband had made an emotional plea to catch her 'racist' killer, after she was found in a pool of blood next to a note which read, 'go back to your country, you terrorist'.

On a Facebook group created for 'One Million Hijabs', women have also sent their messages of support while posting their photos.

Killed: Alawadi, 32, was found beaten and unconscious in her San Diego home in March 2012

The Facebook group associated with One Million Hijabs has already been visited tens of thousands of times by those looking to support Shaima's family

One woman, named only as Saroise, said: 'I wear this Hijab which is in respect to all women who wear it within their own choice, i myself am a protester from Occupy Dame street left a piece of my soul in Tahrir square and heart in Gaza.

Another member of the campaign, Lauralyn, said: 'I am a Detroit school teacher and have been wearing a hijab for almost a week as a symbol against bigotry and discrimination.

'The support and love from my students and community has been almost overwhelming.'

Alawadi was found unconscious by her teenage daughter in the dining room of the family home in El Cajon, one of the nation's largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants.

Speaking in the days after her killing, Kassim Alhimidi, the mother-of-five's husband, said: 'The main question we would like to ask is what are you getting out of this and why did you do it?'

Ten of thousands of women have visited a Facebook group set up for One Million Hijabs already since Alawadi's tragic death last month
