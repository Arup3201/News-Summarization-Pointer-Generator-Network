A puppy managed to crash its owner's Lada into into a gleaming Mercedes in a crowded car park in Russia.

The Siberian husky has been left alone in the parked car while its owner went to a nearby repair shop in Barnaul in southern Siberia.

A bystander said the puppy ‘went mad’ and while rampaging around the car connected the wiring in a way that started the ignition.

‘The car was parked on a small hill which helped it get going,’ the eyewitness told Siberian Times.

‘The puppy was even steering the wheel, so that the car made a small semicircle and crashed into a parked Mercedes and then a SsangYong car.’

Police were ’in stitches of laughter when they realised what had happened’, she said.

The police had no idea who to make responsible for the crash and the Lada owner blamed the puppy for damage to the other vehicles.

The owners of the other cars were told to resolve the matter with their insurance companies.

‘The puppy got very nervous after a long wait and started crashing around inside the car, and somehow managed to start the engine,’ said a police spokesman.

‘The car moved and crashed into two parked vehicles, a SsangYong and Mercedes.

‘Barnaul traffic police has registered the crash.  The rest should be sorted by the insurance company.’
