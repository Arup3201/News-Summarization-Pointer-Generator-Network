Pleading not guilty: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is on trial for an alleged bomb plot on a Detroit-bound plane

The trial of an alleged al Qaeda terrorist who tried to destroy a Detroit-bound plane with a bomb hidden in his underwear begins today.

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, from Nigeria, was known to have been heavily influenced in his extremist views by the American-born, Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by the CIA in Yemen last week.

Abdulmutallab faces eight charges, 
including conspiracy to commit terrorism and attempted use of a weapon 
of mass destruction.

U.S. authorities have accused the 24-year-old of detonating chemicals 
in his underwear seven minutes before the flight was to land at 
Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Christmas Day 2009.

The bomb failed to explode and passengers and crew leapt on Abdulmutallab to stop him. He suffered serious burns to his groin area.

Proceedings against Abdulmutallab will open with jury selection. Prosecutors already have his hospital-bed confession, dozens of witnesses, remnants of the explosive and a video of the 24-year-old explaining his suicide mission.

He has pleaded not guilty.

Abdulmutallab is acting as his own 
lawyer. Anthony Chambers, an attorney appointed to assist him, said 
al-Awlaki's death might make jury selection more difficult but that it wasn't 
relevant to the trial.

Abdulmutallab, who is well-educated and comes from an upper-class family, was reportedly convinced by the radicial teachings of al-Awlaki.

One official said the cleric had directed Abdulmutallab to detonate an explosive device over U.S. airspace to maximise the number of casualties.

According to prosecutors, the 
alleged extremist said he wanted to become a martyr when he boarded 
Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam along with 278 other 
passengers and 11 crew.

He told authorities that he trained in
Yemen, an al Qaeda stronghold in the Arabian Peninsula.

He said he was 
influenced by the preacher al-Awlaki, who was killed on Friday by an air strike that 
President Obama called a 'major blow' to al Qaeda.

The failed attack on the Detroit-bound plane two years ago was the first act of terrorism in the U.S. during the Obama administration.

A 
conviction on multiple charges could bolster the argument that terror 
suspects should be prosecuted in civilian courts and not through military 
proceedings.Â 

Evidence: The syringe detonator said to have been inside Abdulmutallab's underwear. Jurors in his trial will be shown a model of the bomb

Vijay Padmanabhan, a lawyer who has handled cases involving terror-related detainees at Guantanamo Bay, said: 'Convictions that are achieved in 
federal court using proper procedures will be upheld on appeal. That's 
simply too powerful a tool for the President not to use.

'What people will be looking to see is whether the administration can bring what appears be a fairly straightforward case to fruition.'

Patricia 'Scotti' Keepman from Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, was seated several rows behind Abdulmutallab on the flight with her husband, daughter, and two newly adopted children from Ethiopia.

Mrs Keepman said: 'He needs to be held accountable in a trial. It's as simple as that.'
