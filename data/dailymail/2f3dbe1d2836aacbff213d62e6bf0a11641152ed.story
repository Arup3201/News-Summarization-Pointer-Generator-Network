A mother who is accused of beating her two-year-old son to death attended parenting classes where she 'pretended to be a caring mother', a court heard today.

Rebecca Shuttleworth, 24, and her boyfriend Luke Southerton, 31, are accused of torturing Keanu Williams over a period of several months and battering him to death over 48 hours.

Keanu, nicknamed 'Kiwi, was found with 37 devastating injuries when he was found dead by a paramedic on the sofa of Southerton's flat in Ward End, Birmingham, in January last year.

Trial: Rebecca Shuttleworth and Luke Southerton in the dock at Birmingham Crown Court today, where they stand accused of murdering her son Keanu, 2

Death: Two-year-old Keanu Williams's body showed 37 external marks of injury allegedly inflicted in 48 hours

Birmingham Crown Court heard today that the youngsters was found with 'waxen' skin and 'fixed and dilated' eyes after the couple dialled 999 on January 9.

He was rushed to the Heartlands Hospital but had died from internal injuries.

The court heard that Shuttleworth had attended a number of parenting courses after giving birth to Keanu in Torquay, Devon where she was living at the time before moving to Birmingham.

Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC accused her of using her knowledge of the care system to 'manipulate social workers, doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and caring mother.'

Mr Hotten told the court: 'Rebecca Shuttleworth ill-treated, neglected 
and assaulted her son Keanu and we say that this is not simply a case of
being immature or naive or indeed a substandard mother.

'She had attended a number of 
parenting courses and after the birth of Keanu in 2008 she was given 
extensive support by health and social services workers in Torquay.

'In 2009 she attended a 12-week 
course designed to support her well being and confidence in parenting 
and we say it was her family and friends who saw the reality of her 
treatment of Keanu.'

Shuttleworth's friends and family 
told police that Keanu was often neglected, often unwashed and would be 
left in a soiled nappy for extended periods.

Mr Hotten added 'Her attitude was one
of someone who resented Keanu and thought he was in the way and an 
obstruction to her living her life as she wanted.

'He was often unwashed and dressed in
grubby clothes and many people spoke of the fact that he would go for 
long periods with his nappy unchanged, his soiled nappy hanging off him.

Tragic: Baby Keanu was found lifeless on a Birmingham sofa by paramedics early in 2011

'She would swear and shout at Keanu, she was seen by a number of people to handle him very roughly and to hit him, grabbing him by the arms, slapping him to the arms, the legs and the bottom, sometimes hard enough to mark him.

'We say that this behaviour was meted out to Keanu within months of his birth.'

The court heard that Shuttleworth told concerned nursery staff that Keanu had fallen over to explain his injuries.

Mr Hotten said that Shuttleworth and her sister Angela had a 'disruptive' childhood, with Shuttleworth having spent time in care as a youngster.

He said: 'Their mother was an alcoholic, she struggled to care for her daughters and they spent lengthy periods of time in care and both sisters had considerable experience of the care system and of social workers.

'A key issue in this case is whether, as we suggest, her experiences equipped Rebecca to manage and manipulate social workers, teachers, doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and caring mother, for the picture painted by her friends and family is different.'

Shuttleworth had taken a 'fit and healthy' Keanu to Southerton's flat on January 7, 2011, before both of them beat him over the next two days.

A post mortem revealed Keanu died of internal bleeding and tests showed he may have suffered months of abuse prior to his death.

Mr Hotten said: 'How was it that this two-year-old boy came to die on a sofa in a flat in Ward End, Birmingham?

'The answer, sadly, is that he was beaten to death.

'His fatal injuries, we say, were not an isolated event but the culmination of months of ill-treatment and assaults."

The pair did not report Keanu's injuries out of fear they would be arrested and only called an ambulance after he was dead.

He added: 'He was not breathing, there was no pulse, the pupils of his eyes were fixed and dilated, his skin was white and waxen.

'No medical help was sought for this child until he was dead.

'Both Rebecca and Luke must have known that Keanu was assaulted and was profoundly unwell.

'Their only hope was that he might recover untreated.

'Both were in it together, it was understood between them that Keanu had been beaten and punished and each had been criminally responsible for the injuries that caused his death.

'Any competent carer would have realised that he was profoundly unwell and would have called an ambulance.'

Investigation: Police and forensic officers outside the home where Keanu was allegedly battered to death by those who should have cared for him

On the way to the hospital, paramedics had questioned Shuttleworth about the hours leading up to Keanu's death. She told them that he had been refusing to eat and had vomited earlier that day.

As well as a murder charge, both defendants also face one charge each of causing or allowing the death of a child and one charge each of child cruelty.

Both deny all counts.

In December 2010 Shuttleworth called NHS Direct after Keanu bruised his forehead and burned the bottom of his feet when he was staying at Southerton's flat.

In a transcript of the call read to the jury, she tells the operator: 'He [Keanu] just seems so accident prone, everything's going wrong for him.

'This morning I got him up and his bed, I know it's silly but it's by the radiator and he burned his foot on the radiator when he got up this morning.'

Following advice from the operator, Shuttleworth took Keanu to hospital, which prompted a child protection examination, including a police inspection of Southerton's flat.

Mr Hotten said Shuttleworth texted Southerton to alert him to the police visit and tell him what she told officers.

He said: 'Rebecca texted Luke to warn him that the police were going to come to his flat and that they wanted to look at the radiator and the position of the bed.

'We say that the obvious implication is that she is texting this to Mr Southerton to make sure that their stories fit together.

'It is our contention this shows that Rebecca and Luke were acting together to cover up a series of injuries to Keanu that we say were plainly not accidental.'

Shuttleworth, who wept throughout the court hearing, faces a further cruelty charge relating to another child who cannot be named be legal reasons.

Addressing the jury of four men and eight women, Judge Mr Justice Spencer told them not to let their verdicts become 'affected by emotion.'

He said: 'I’m sure you understand the absolute crucial importance of you as jurors not being affected by emotion at all in this case.

'What’s called for by a jury in a case of this kind is a cool and dispassionate assessment of the evidence and that is what will lead you to true verdicts.'

Shuttleworth and Southerton are both on bail.

The trial is expected to last up to three months.
