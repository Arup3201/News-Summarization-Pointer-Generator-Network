Swiss right-to-die group Exit has applied for permission to change its office into an assisted suicide centre. If the plan is agreed, it will become the second DIY death centre in the country.

Dignitas operates an assisted suicide clinic on the outskirts of Zurich where hundreds of people, including dozens of Britons, have ended their lives in the past few years.

Exit helped 32 people in the Basel area die last year and is 'struggling to keep up with demand', according to Swiss media. Until now it has assisted in ending peoples' lives in hospitals and care homes and sometimes ships them via ambulance to the Dignitas premises.

This building in Zurich houses the assisted suicide clinic. Now Exit want to alter the purpose of their office so that people can kill themselves there too

Exit's application to transform its office in Binningen, near Basel, into a second Swiss assisted suicide clinic has been met with anger from local residents who claim it will create an 'unwelcome atmosphere'.

'Local authorities are also concerned the move will increase so-called suicide tourism to the area, given the area's proximity to the borders with France and Germany,' said a Swiss news website.

Dignitas, a Zurich-based organisation, helps people to kill themselves.  Candidates have to fill in an official form to prove they want to commit suicide. They also choose the music that they are going to listen to during their last moments

Exit says the fears are unfounded because the facility will only be used by a 'small number' of people registered with them to die.

'Of the 459 clients in the Zurich area that Exit helps to die each year, only 31 of them require such a facility,' reported Swiss media.

A total of 172 people travelled to Switzerland from overseas in 2012, double the number three years previously, to kill themselves with the vast majority ending their lives at Dignitas.

In May this year, Exit voted to extend its services to the elderly who do not have a terminal illness, allowing those with problems relating to old age the choice to end their lives.

The president of the Swiss Medical Association criticized the move, saying: 'It cannot be ruled out that elderly healthy people could come under pressure of taking their own life.'

Nine years ago, Soraya Wernli, a former worker for Dignitas, broke with the group and later went public with claims that it was a money-obsessed organisation whose members were often fleeced of their savings and possessions before they ended their lives with a lethal cocktail of drugs.
