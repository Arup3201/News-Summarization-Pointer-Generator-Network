A baby who last week became the youngest person to be fitted with an artificial heart has died.

Baby Tiarna Middleton passed away at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle just six days after being put on a Berlin heart.

It was hoped the 18-day-old baby girl would be kept alive by the artificial heart for long enough to allow her to have a heart transplant.

Tiarna Gray, 18 days old, died last night at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital just six days after becoming the youngest person in the UK to be fitted with an artificial heart

Tiarna's parents, Sharney Gray and Gary Middleton, say she died after complications developed

But tragically, she died last night in the hospital’s paediatric intensive care unit with her parents, Sharney Gray and Gary Middleton, at her side.

Ms Gray, 22, from Gateshead, said Tiarna had suffered a medical complication in the days following her 10 hour operation and had become extremely ill following a blockage.

She said: ‘She passed away last night. They turned the Berlin heart off.’

Tiarna was born on May 22, weighing just 5lb 8oz, and was suffering from a rare condition which meant she was missing vital coronary arteries and the right side of her heart had not grown at all.

She was initially put on an ECMO machine - a heart and lung bypass machine - to keep her alive while doctors looked for a donor.

However, none were immediately available and medics knew it would be hard to find a heart small enough for her.

Tiarna (pictured in hospital last week) was born with severe heart defects and was put on the artificial heart in a bid to keep her alive until a transplant could be carried out

So, she was fitted with the Berlin heart in a bid to keep her alive while medics searched for a donor heart.

A Berlin 
heart is a device which can be used in people whose hearts are not 
strong enough to pump enough blood around their bodies.

It is used to allow time for a donor heart to be found.

It is an air driven pump which takes over the work of the person's own heart.

It can be used to take over the work of one or both sides of the heart.

The Berlin heart consists of a plastic chamber which sits outside the body.

It
 has a blood filled side and an air filled side and the blood filled 
side of the pump is connected directly to the child's own heart and main
 artery by two tubes.

It can be used for as long as several months but a person cannot remain on it indefinitely.

This decision was made as children can remain on a Berlin heart for longer than they can on an ECMO machine.

Tiarna’s family have brought attention to current UK medical guidelines which mean babies under two months old cannot be organ donors.

They say this regulation needs to be reconsidered as it is currently very difficult to find donated organs small enough for young babies.
