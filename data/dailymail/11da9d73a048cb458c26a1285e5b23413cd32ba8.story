A graphic designer accused of poisoning her mother in a Breaking Bad-inspired murder plot fantasised about being Walter White or a 'Mexican drug warlord', a court has heard.

Kuntal Patel allegedly became 'obsessed' with killing her mother Meena and bought deadly poison online after the 60-year-old 'forbade' her from marrying the man she loved.

The 37-year-old, from Stratford, east London, contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'.

But, today, Breaking Bad-obsessed Patel told jurors it was all part of her 'fantasy' in which she imagined herself as a character in the American TV series.

The series ends with teacher-turned-drug producer Walter White spiking a rival's drink with deadly ricin.

Patel told Southwark Crown Court: 'It was like I saw myself to be some kind of Mexican drug warlord. I would think it through as if I was the main character in Breaking Bad.

'It was all a big mess. A complete and utter mess.

'I think in my mind, because I was living in my fantasy world, in my TV episode that I had created in my mind, I was just trying to find out what it would be like.' 

Patel, who worked for Barclays in Canary Wharf, is accused of trying to kill her mother by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly toxin after the breakdown of her engagement to Niraj Kakad.

During the second day of her evidence, the court heard how Patel had emailed the dealer after receiving the drug saying something had 'gone wrong' - because the 'target' was still alive.

She wrote: 'Something has definitely gone wrong somewhere as it is now early Saturday morning and still everything is normal.

'Yes, target drank all of it. I made sure I watched her drink it all. I had to borrow money from friends to get this stuff from you because it's my last option.

'I can't be with the man I love because my mother doesn't like him. She is a bitter, miserable old woman and has been physically mean to me and my sister.'

But speaking to the jury, Patel insisted the email was a 'fabrication'.

Accused: Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard how Patel (pictured in a court sketch) fantasised about being Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad, or a Mexican warlord 

She told the court how she initially ordered a batch of the deadly poison for £950 but 'panicked' and threw it away. 

But a few weeks later, the situation at home became too much for Patel to handle and she started having thoughts about killing herself and her mother again, she told jurors. 

The court had previously heard how her mother started beating her 'on and off' when she grew bitter about her daughter's new relationship with Niraj Kakad, whom she met online. 

Patel explained that she wanted more poison but did not want to pay for it. So she fabricated the story about feeding her mother the poison  so she could get another batch from the dealer for free, jurors heard. 

If he had known it was thrown away, the deal would have charged her another £950, she said. 

The prosecutor later labelled her version of events as 'one last roll of the dice' in an attempt to cover her tracks.  

She told jurors: 'I told him, I pretended that I had used it and I had watched my mother drink it. And I thought that by doing that it would pressurise him into sending another package.

But she said emails sent to her dealer claiming she had poisoned her mother were a 'fabrication' 

'I know how it appears, but the truth is I didn't do anything, it's all fabrication.

'It escalated and I had to go to work and pretend like everything was OK and I had to be at home and pretend everything was OK.

'But I was living this other life. This was my own way of coping - it was my coping mechanism. It was how I survived daily.'

Wiping away tears from her eyes, she told the jury: 'I didn't do it, I didn't put anything in my mother's coke.'  

The court previously heard how Patel got poison sent to her hidden in a candle. It is alleged she slipped it to her mother's drink in December last year.

But Patel claims she freaked out when she saw the candle and threw it away.

Prosecutor Mr Polnay told the court that Patel was a 'liar' and not a fantasist and wanted her mother 'dead by Christmas'. 

He suggested she was buying the poison because she 'wanted it for murder'. 

But Patel replied: 'That's not true.'  

Mr Polnay continued: 'The truth is, to be with the man you loved you couldn't see any other way but to knock off your mum.'

He added: 'I suggest this Breaking Bad fantasy is one last desperate roll of the dice. The last story after all the other lies had been uncovered.'

But Patel insisted she was not lying in court, saying: 'The truth is, I could never hurt myself or my mother.' 

The former London Olympics volunteer said that when counter terrorism police raided her home in January she thought Jehovah's Witnesses were at her door.

She was arrested and spent four days being questioned by officers at a police station.

She told the court: 'I was told to quickly grab some clothing and leave the house. That was the last time I saw my mum and my sister.

'It was like a really bad dream. It just wasn't the real me. It was like me coming back to my senses and reality.

'It was a huge reality check, it was me coming back into the real world, real life, having to account for my actions.'

In court, Patel admitted telling police 'a pack of lies' lying to police because she was terrified they would discover her email exchanges with the dealer. 

She said: 'I know I lied, I told many lies. The reason I lied was because I was frightened and scared.

'I didn't want the police to know what I had done in relation to the searches. I was terrified about what I had done in relation to the searches.' 

Peter Rowlands, defending, told jurors that, during a phonecall from Holloway Prison, Patel told her mother: 'I was going to kill you and Ambama saw that, that's why she is punishing me.'

In the call, Patel added: 'I have done everything bad and dirty and goddess Ambama has seen what this girl is doing to her mum and so she has sent me here.'

The Hindu goddess Ambama is said to punish bad acts.

But Patel said she did not mean her 'confession' literally.

She said: 'I meant that Ambama the goddess saw that I had these kind of thoughts against my mother. Not that I literally had done anything, which I had not.'  

Jurors heard how at work and at home Ms Patel was living one life, but in her mind was living a second 'secret life'.

She claimed that like every other girl she wanted her mother at her wedding, and could never kill herself or her mother.

She also confessed to hating the magistrate for scuppering her chances of love. 

Jurors have been read a series of messages exchanged between Patel and two of her friends, Julie Wong and Darcia Babb, in which Patel expressed her desire for her mother's death.

In one she wrote: 'I am stuck with that miserable f*** until she dies.'

She admitted to the court that she felt her mother was responsible in part for a 'roadblock' ruining her one shot chance of getting married, having a family, moving out of Stratford and 'living happily ever after'. 

Jurors heard Patel also allegedly looked on Google for how to find a hit man in Mumbai. Her mother had travelled to the Indian city for a court case.

The court previously heard how she combed poison websites and Googled 'How to murder someone and get away with it' after being 'obsessed' with thoughts about killing her mother and taking her own life.

Patel told jurors she would watch stay up all night watching and taking notes on Breaking Bad, later planning to buy a poison.

She also became fixated with taking her own life and spent hours scouring suicide websites, the court was told. 

Ms Patel admits two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin, but denies attempted murder and a further charge of acquiring a biological agent or toxin.

The trial continues.
