Celtic completed a deadline-busting swoop for Stefan Scepovic but missed out on a second striker when a deal for Manchester City's John Guidetti collapsed just after midnight due to the paperwork failing to go through in time.

Serbian international Scepovic became the only transfer fee paid in the Scottish window when his second u-turn in 24 hours teed up a £2.2million move from Sporting Gijon.

And, hours after shipping out Amido Balde, Teemu Pukki, Holmbert Fridjonsson on loan, Celtic manager Ronny Deila thought he’d made it a double with a 12-month deal to take Guidetti from Manchester City. The 22-year-old travelled to Glasgow, but saw the deal fall down when the registration papers from both sides failed to give the SFA enough time to process the transfer.

The deal for number one target Scepovic ended a rollercoaster pursuit when Celtic declared themselves ‘disgusted’ by his decision to sign for Spanish club Getafe instead.

By mid-afternoon, however, Spanish league Financial Fair Play regulations had wrecked that deal - forcing the striker’s agents to go cap in hand to Celtic begging for a reprieve.

Guidetti hoped to join fellow City loan signing Jason Denayer in Glasgow after just one first appearance for the English champions.

But Celtic senior sources said they were content to land Scepovic after the ‘will he won’t he?’ saga was finally resolved.

Despite strong interest from Southampton and Sunderland, the Scottish champions refused to sell unsettled defender Virgil van Dijk.

But they did allow Amido Balde to join Belgium’s Beveren on a year loan, while Pukki and Fridjonsson both joined Danish club Brondby for the next 12 months.

Dylan McGeouch, also moved to Hibernian on loan until the end of the season while fringe player Jackson Irvine was allowed to go on loan to Ross County.

Elsewhere in Scotland, Dundee United midfielder Michael Gardyne returned to former club Ross County on loan. The managerless Staggies have also signed defender Darren Barr and have agreed a loan deal for Celtic midfielder Jackson Irvine.

Aberdeen defender Joe Shaughnessy has joined Championship Falkirk on loan.
