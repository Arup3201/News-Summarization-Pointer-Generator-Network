An investigation has been launched into a female officer who was assaulted when she returned from a holiday with a policeman it is alleged she had an affair with.

West Midlands Police today confirmed they would be looking into the alleged affair involving PCs Mark Davis and WPC Elaine Turner but did not go into any more details.

It was revealed that Mr Davis went to Turkey telling the mother of his three children that he was going on a week-long stag do.

However his partner turned detective and caught him and his WPC lover when they returned home from a romantic getaway.

Fellow passengers witnessed Helen McEvoy and her sister Donna asking Mr Davis if he had enjoyed the break ‘with your bit on the side’ as they ambushed him and Miss Turner at the airport.

The quartet then became involved in a fracas that sent a display of chocolate bars  flying before police intervened. The whole incident was captured on CCTV.

The McEvoy sisters, who were arrested and charged with assault, received 12-month conditional discharges after magistrates accepted that Mr Davis’s partner had suffered a ‘great degree of provocation’.

Outlining the ‘sad and sordid background’ to the case, Philip Haycock, defending, said Mr Davis, 29, had sent McEvoy, also 29, a flurry of loving texts saying how much he was missing her during the ‘stag week’, supposedly for a colleague.

However, when a suspicious McEvoy looked up the ‘groom’ in question, she found he was still at home in Dudley, West Midlands.

McEvoy then called Mr Davis, at which
 point he changed his story and claimed to be ‘on his own, trying to get
 his head together’.

Solihull magistrates court heard that he told McEvoy he would be flying in to Gatwick, where he arranged to meet her.

She
 did not believe him, and instead went to Birmingham Airport on the day 
he was due back. She and her sister were waiting at 1am as Mr Davis, 
still wearing his holiday shorts and T-shirt, emerged with two suitcases
 – and 35-year-old Miss Turner in tow.

Mr Haycock said: ‘The sisters shouted: “Hope you enjoyed your holiday with your bit on the side.”

‘They did not travel to the airport to
 cause a problem. Helen wanted to show Elaine that Mr Davis had been 
playing both of them and that they were still in a relationship.

‘She tried to show the text messages, but the situation deteriorated very quickly.’

The
 court heard Mr Davis had already been forgiven once before for cheating
 on McEvoy with Miss Turner, a colleague of his at West Bromwich police 
station. He had dismissed the incident as a one-night stand.

Mr
 Haycock added that his client McEvoy, a benefits adviser at Dudley 
Council, believed Miss Turner had tried to make trouble for her at work 
by sending a letter to her boss on police-headed paper accusing her of 
harassment.

‘I would 
have thought that if this was the case a complaint would have been made 
to police,’ he said, adding that he was ‘concerned’ at the serving 
officer’s use of official paper for the letter.

West Midlands Police’s professional standards department is investigating the matter.

‘I would have thought that anybody caught having an affair would have taken it  on the chin and would not pour salt on the wounds by pursuing a prosecution,’ Mr Haycock added.

He stressed that the McEvoy sisters both accepted their behaviour was ‘not entirely appropriate’, but described his client as ‘the victim in this case even though she appears as the defendant’.

McEvoy, from Dudley, admitted assaulting Miss Turner. Her older sister Donna, also of Dudley, admitted assaulting both Mr Davis and Miss Turner.

Sentencing, magistrate Michael Martin said: ‘It’s obvious a deplorable series of events led to this incident.

‘We believe both sisters attended to determine if [Mr Davis] had been telling the truth, and not for a violent confrontation. There is a considerable amount of mitigation in this case.’

Yesterday McEvoy was not answering the door of the semi-detached property she shared with Mr Davis. Her mother told the Daily Mail that she was no longer in a relationship with the policeman, but declined to comment further.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said Mr Davis and Miss Turner would not face sanctions over their relationship, but added: ‘We can confirm an investigation is ongoing involving a female police officer.’

A spokesman for West Midlands Police refused to give details about the nature of the investigation into PC Turner, but added: 'We can confirm that an investigation is currently ongoing involving a female police officer.'
