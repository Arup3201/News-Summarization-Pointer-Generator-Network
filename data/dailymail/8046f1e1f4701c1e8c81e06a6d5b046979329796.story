A child who was suspected to have been infected with Ebola has been cleared of the illness in a Melbourne hospital on Sunday.

The one-year-old Nigerian baby was rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital on Friday after presenting symptoms similar to those experienced by Ebola patients.

It was understood that the child had arrived in Australia after being in a West African nation where the disease is known to be prevalent.

Paramedics donning full protective suits transferred the baby to an isolation room according to the Herald Sun. 

The Ebola scare would have been the first real test of Victoria's Ebola Virus Disease Response Plan which was rolled out across metropolitan and regional health services following a scare in Brisbane earlier this month.

Victorian health minister David Davis issued a statement on Thursday outlined the details of the Response Plan.

'The plan outlines the exact actions that will be taken by the Department of Health, Commonwealth border agencies, Ambulance Victoria, any health service and in particular the two hospitals that will receive a suspected case,'the statement said.

'The Royal Melbourne Hospital is the designated facility for assessment and management of patients suspected to have a Viral Haemorrhagic Fever such as Ebola virus disease and is fully prepared.

'The plan requires the patient to be isolated in a single occupancy negative pressure room. Treatment and care would be provided by staff trained to use infection control precautions including specific personal protective equipment.'

Boarder control measures have also been put into place, according to Victoria's Chief Health Officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, including questionnaires for people arriving from affected countries.

'All people returning from affected countries are given a card telling them to look out for symptoms for 21 days and to attend an emergency department or GP if they do become unwell,' she said.

The Nigerian baby incident is the second scare involving Ebola on Australian shores this month.

It comes shortly after a Brisbane man was feared to have been infected with the disease following his return from a trip to the Congo in August.
