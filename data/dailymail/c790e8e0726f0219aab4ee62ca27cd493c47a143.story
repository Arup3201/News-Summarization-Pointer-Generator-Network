A cheese factory in eastern France may seem a world away from the bleak, oppressive regime of North Korea.

But Kim Jong-un thinks he may have sniffed an opportunity to bring a touch of Gallic culture to his homeland.

Tired of his country's bland attempts to produce a quality cheese, the despot ruler is sending a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production.

The three specialists are preparing to spend several months at the National Dairy Industry College (ENIL).

Ironically much of that will be dedicated to making one type of cheese - the dictator's favourite Emmental, which is originally Swiss.

This is reportedly Kim's snack of choice, which he is thought to have taken a liking to while studying in Switzerland, it was reported by the BBC which cited La Lettre A.fr website.

The other main aim of the so-called 
'cheese diplomacy' visit is to improve standards at the Pynongyang dairy
 in the North Korean capital which has failed to deliver a sufficient 
quality of cheese.

Meanwhile, arch-rival South Korea is a huge cheese importer, so much so that it is driving American milk prices record levels.

Yesterday, pictures emerged of Kim touring a renovated children's camp.

The plush 'international' children's centre boasts its own aquarium, a swimming pool and football pitch - with places at the camp offered as a reward to the country's highest achieving students.

He also hit the headlines last week when North Korean agents demanded the Foreign Office intervene in a row with a London hairdresser who used a picture of Kim Jong-un to advertise its 15 per cent 'bad hair' discount.

M&M Hair Academy in South Ealing sparked a diplomatic incident after it lampooned the dictator's unique hairstyle in a poster hung in its shop window.
