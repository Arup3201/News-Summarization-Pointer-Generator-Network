Richard Scudamore, beleaguered Premier league chief executive, will be called to account by the FA to deliver his promises of engaging on equality issues.

FA independent director Heather Rabbatts has been charged with the FA of ensuring that Scudamore, following the sexist email exchange scandal, keeps his 'undertaking to take further steps on inclusion and diversity.'

This followed a meeting between FA chairman Greg Dyke, Rabbatts, chairman of the FA inclusion board and Peter McCormick, interim PL chairman who explained the process behind the PL clubs voting unanimously not to take action against  CEO following his puerile exchanges with TV rights lawyer Nick West.

Watch: Richard Scudamore will be called to account by the FA to deliver his promises

Judgement: FA board member Heather Rabbatts has called for major action in light of the sexism row

'Entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology I have made is sincere, as is the contrition I feel. These exchanges do not reflect my views towards women in football, the workplace or in general. It is something that will never be repeated.

'The Premier League Shareholders have considered and deliberated this matter and I fully accept and respect their recommendations and conclusions.

'I appreciate that I have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the game who do not know me that my leadership and work in the areas of equality and discrimination to date reflect who I am and what I believe. So, I will now undertake meetings and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders in the game to hear their views and to reassure them that I will continue to do my utmost personally, and through all the Premier League’s means to help promote diversity and inclusion, develop the women’s game and support women who want be involved in football at any level.

'I am grateful for the support I have received throughout this from family, friends and colleagues, but especially the women who work with me at the Premier League.'

Dyke said McCormick had assured him  
the PL had followed: 'proper process under their own employment and 
disciplinary rules and had conducted a thorough investigation.'

Dyke
 added: 'We said last week that we considered the contents of the emails
 in question to be totally inappropriate and we are still of that view.
 I have asked Heather  to follow up with the Premier League to discuss 
the wider issues  around the inclusion agenda and see how the FA and 
Premier League can work together.'

The
 FA restated its position that it cannot take disciplinary action 
itself against Scudamore , despite claims from Edward Lord, the 
outspoken  member  of the FA inclusion board  that he has legal advice 
to the contrary. But the inclusion board meeting was a non-event last 
night with a brief statement from Rabbatts afterwards 'welcoming 
Scudamore's contrite apology.'

Dyke
 said: 'The FA does not as a matter of policy consider private 
communications sent with a legitimate  expectation of privacy  to 
amount to professional misconduct. The FA has applied this policy on an 
ongoing basis  and in relation to numerous other cases.'

West
 has also escaped reprimand after an investigation by his law firm DLA 
Piper was concluded last night. A statement  said: 'We have accepted Mr 
West’s assurances that these emails are not reflective of his believes 
and values and there will be no recurrence of this behaviour.'

Inappropriate: But FA Chairman insists they followed the 'proper process' in investigating Scudamore's actions

But 
 Women in Football  kept the heat on  Scudamore calling for an 
independent inquiry. Their statement read: Women in football  is 
disappointed that the Premier League has missed a significant 
opportunity  to demonstrate a strong commitment  to equality in the 
workplace.

'In not 
recommending  action  - in any form whatsoever – it will be extremely difficult for women working in the industry to feel reassured  this 
issue has been adequately addressed.

'We
 believe it is imperative that any conclusion reached by the Premier 
League are done so through an objective audit   in which employees are 
given the opportunity to express their views anonymously to an 
independent body.'

And Rani
 Abraham, Scudamore’s former temporary personal assistant who leaked his text exchanges with West to the Sunday Mirror, is considering 
taking legal action against the Premier League.

This
 follows her receiving legal letters from the PL’s Gloucester Place 
headquarters  threatening court action for breach of trust.

Abraham
 said: 'It was a very threatening letter. I have had a couple now and I
 believe the Premier league are  trying to scare me. I won’t go quiet 
because I am standing up for what I believe in. I am speaking to a 
solicitor at the moment .'
