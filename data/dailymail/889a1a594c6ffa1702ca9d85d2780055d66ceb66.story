Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman apologized for verbally attacking San Francisco 49ers running back Michael Crabtree in his first national television appearance since exploding at a sideline reporter after winning the Super Bowl qualifying game

Sherman was interviewed by Erin Andrews while leaving the field and launched into a rant on live tv accusing Crabtree of belittling his abilities.

He said: 'Well, I'm the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you're gonna get .... Don't you [Crabtree] ever talk about me! Don't you open your mouth about the best or I'm gonna shut it for you real quick.'

In an interview with CNN, a composed Sherman apologized for the tirade while also condemning those that blamed his behavior on race - especially so close to Martin Luther King Jr Day.

'It's a small part of who I am': Richard Sherman said adrenaline and a long-standing grudge made him launch his attack on Michael Crabtree

'It was really mind-boggling. And it was kind of - it was kind of sad that the way the world reacted - you know, I can't say the world. I don't want to generalize people like that, because there are a lot of great people who didn't react that way,' Sherman said. 'But for the people who did react that way and throw the racial slurs and things like that out there, it was really sad.'

He says his behavior has to be seen in the context of playing an intensely competitive sport.

'If you catch me in the moment on the field when I am still in that zone, when I'm still as competitive as I can be and I'm trying to be in the place where I have to be to do everything I can to be successful ... and help my team win, then it's not going to come out as articulate, as smart, as charismatic -- because on the field I'm not all those things,' he said.

But he says there's no excuse for the people who called him a 'thug' and a 'monkey' on Twitter.

'What they did was an actual reality. They showed their true character. Those were real comments, not in a moment, not in a - you know, they had time to think about it. They were sitting at a computer and they expressed themselves in a true way. And I thought society had moved past that.'

While he wouldn't apologize for the content of what he said, the Stanford communications graduate did regret the way in which it was said and how that impacted him team.

'Mostly I regret the - I guess the storm afterwards. The - you know, the way it was covered, the way it was perceived, and the attention that it took away from the fantastic performances from my teammates, you know,' Sherman told Nichols. 'I probably shouldn't have attacked another person. I don't mean to attack him. And that was immature. And I probably shouldn't have done that. I regret doing that. But I just felt like my teammates deserved better. And I - you know, I have to apologize to them and I have.'

Sherman's brother said the source of the conflict started when Crabtree was rude to Sherman at a charity event.

During Sunday's game, Sherman even received a penalty for making a two-handed chocking gesture at Crabtree.

Crabtree responded to Sherman's rant on Twitter by saying, 'Film don't lie... @nflnetwork @espn pull up the tape of that game and show me where this guy is the best? #fake #fake #fake'

Sherman remained unruffled and wrote,' There was a lot of talk before the game.... Now I'm the bad guy lol.... Well if u judge my character on the field ....So many glass houses.'

Sherman is known for being a tough guy and a bit of a fire-starter. The LA Times crowns him the king of post game rants and said that he introduced 'U mad, bro?' into the sports insult vocabulary.

USA Today writer Chris Chase defended Sherman in an article and wrote, ' Sherman is brash, loud and so self-centered he makes Kanye look like a wallflower. Heâ€™s also the best corner in the game and on his way to the Super Bowl. You donâ€™t have to like it, Michael, but you at least need to understand it. Next time you beat Richard Sherman, you can talk all you want. Until then, begrudgingly shake the manâ€™s hand and enjoy your offseason.'

Sherman wrote a final response that said, 'A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of a sheep.'
