President Obama has issued a harsh warning to Russia against intervening in the political turmoil in the Ukraine.

He confirmed that the United States is 'deeply concerned' about the presence of Russian military forces in Crimea, solidifying earlier reports that Russian troops had been spotted in the area.

'There will be costs for any military intervention in the Ukraine,' Mr Obama said in an unscheduled press statement Friday afternoon.

Issuing a warning: President Obama said that the U.S. was 'deeply concerned' about the reports of a Russian military takeover in the Ukrainian town of Crimea

Disapproving: The President said that any Russian military intervention would be 'deeply destabilizing' for the Ukraine and would incur worldwide condemnation

The Ukrainian government accused the Russians on Friday of attempting to over take Crimea amid the country's ongoing political turmoil following fatal protests and the disappearance of their president.

Russia has been carefully watched throughout as there are fears that they will try to take over the country amid the turbulence.

Mr Obama stressed that the United States has told Russia that they can play a role in the situation but should only have the same type of involvement as all other international players.

Under watch: Putin has not confirmed or denied any connection to the troops but they are widely understood to be Russian forces

'They can be part of an international community's effort...However we are now deeply concerned about reports of military movements taken by Russian forces,' Obama said.

'We have been very clear about one 
fundamental principle: the Ukrainian people deserve the right to 
determine their own destiny.'

'Any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing.

'It would invite the condemnation of world.'

Mr
 Obama said that he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin two days 
ago and Vice President Joe Biden had called Ukraine's acting President 
Oleksandr Turchynov today to express America's solidarity with them, 
saying that the United States 'supports his government's efforts'.

'Right now the situation remains very fluid... I commend the Ukrainian government's restraint,' Mr Obama said.

Throughout
 the day Friday, men described as Russian troops deployed at airports 
and a coast guard base, giving ominous signs of the Kremlin's iron hand 
in Ukraine's confrontation.

The
 sudden arrival of men in military uniform patrolling key strategic 
facilities prompted the Ukraine to accuse Russia of making 'a military 
invasion and occupation'.

Armed men took control of two airports in the Crimea region on Friday in what Ukraine's government described as an invasion and occupation by Russian forces, stoking tension between Moscow and the West

President Obama's unscheduled press 
conference came after American United Nations ambassador Samantha Power 
issued her own strong warning, saying the the United States 'calls upon 
Russia to pull back the military forces'.

'The United States stands with the Ukrainian people in determining their own government,' Ms Power said.

Secretary
 of State John Kerry delivered blunt warnings to Moscow against military
 moves in Crimea that could further inflame tensions.

Kerry and White House spokesman Jay Carney both said any Russian military intervention in Ukraine would be a 'grave mistake'.

They did not, however, spell out any consequences for such an intervention.

Kerry
 said he called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for the second 
time in two days to press the Kremlin to keep its promise to respect 
Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Questionable: The masked soldiers do not have any identifying insignia but are believed to be Russian in origin, and President Obama confirmed that during his Friday afternoon press conference

Kerry told reporters that Lavrov had once again repeated Russian President Putin's pledge to do just that while also pointing out that Russia has broad interests in Ukraine, including a major naval base in Crimea.

But Kerry, in comments that 
highlighted Washington's rising suspicion of Moscow, said the U.S. is 
watching to see if Russian activity in Crimea 'might be crossing a line 
in any way.'

He added 
that the administration would be 'very careful' in making judgments 
about that. Carney echoed Kerry's comments at the White House.

'While
 we were told that they are not engaging in any violation of the 
sovereignty and do not intend to, I nevertheless made it clear that that
 could be misinterpreted at this moment,' Kerry said.

'There are enough tensions that it is important for everybody to be extremely careful not to inflame the situation and not send the wrong messages.'

Oleksandr Turchynov, who stepped in as president after Viktor Yanukovych fled Kiev last weekend, said the Ukrainian military will fulfill its duty but will not be drawn into provocations.

The news comes as the UN Security Council announced it was holding private consultations to discuss the crisis in Ukraine.

However, any action by the Security Council is highly unlikely because Russia is a veto-wielding permanent member and can block any enforceable measures.

Ukraine's ex-President Yanukovych has made his first public appearance since being ousted, telling a news conference that he was going to fight for his country's future

Rhetoric: Secretary of State John Kerry made his own warning at an earlier Friday press conference

On his way into the meeting, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said 'I have no idea' what could come out of the session.

British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the private meeting would be about de-escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia, and guaranteeing Ukraine's territorial integrity.

Meanwhile, Ukraine International Airlines says it has canceled flights to and from the regional capital of Crimea due to the closure of the airspace over the peninsula.

The airline said it has canceled flights to and from Simferopol airport on Friday evening and Saturday.

British Prime Minster David Cameron said today he is concerned by the situation in Crimea, and it is important that Russia respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

'We are particularly concerned by the situation in Crimea - every country should respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.

'Russia has made that commitment and it's important that Russia keeps its word. The world will be watching,' he added.
