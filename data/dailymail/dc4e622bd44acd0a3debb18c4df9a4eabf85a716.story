A desperate father in China has resorted to smoking his sick daughter - because he cannot afford a bone marrow transplant for the youngster.

Wei Shufu, from the Yunnan province in China, is attempting to treat six-year-old Wei Jinqiu with smoke from burning medicinal herbs.

The farmer spent all of the family's savings on preliminary treatment for his sick child, who was diagnosed with Mediterranean Anemia in October last year.

Doctors there suggested she underwent a bone marrow transplant.

But this would have cost 300,000 yuan (£31,000) - a huge expense for a rural family whose annual income is less than 4,000 yuan.

Unable to afford the fees, the family were forced to take matters into their hands.

After a recommendation from a patient he met at the hospital, Wei's father then decided to try smoking therapy - by burning medicinal herbs.
