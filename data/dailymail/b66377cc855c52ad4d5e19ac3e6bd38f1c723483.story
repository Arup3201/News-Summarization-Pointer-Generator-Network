A finger injury means Kevin Pietersen will not play for Surrey on Friday but he will be available to face Essex in a weeks' time.

Pietersen is still to make his seasonal debut on the county scene and when he does, it will be his first game on home soil since his acrimonious parting of ways with the England team.

He was a casualty of the disastrous Ashes tour of last winter and has had to rail against suggestions he was a disruptive influence in the camp.

Since his central contract was terminated he has been on IPL duty with Delhi but is travelling back to England for the T20 Blast competition.

It was expected Surrey may ask him to play against Middlesex in that competition on Friday, but a statement on Surrey's website said Pietersen has a finger injury.

'Kevin Pietersen is unavailable for the game due to ongoing problems with the finger injury which hampered him throughout the IPL. After seeing a hand specialist today Kevin has been told he does not need surgery but will require five days of intensive physiotherapy,' the statement said.

'Pietersen will be available to play against Essex in the NatWest T20 Blast at the Kia Oval on Friday June 6 and for the remainder of the competition.'

Pietersen then took to Twitter to confirm his Surrey debut was likely to come next week.

He said: 'Frustrating having to miss tomorrow night for @surreycricket, but all being well, my debut for summer '14 will be next week!'
