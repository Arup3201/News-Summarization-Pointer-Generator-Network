A grieving widow has won the right to keep her dead husband’s frozen sperm while she decides whether or not to have his baby.

Beth Warren, 28, lost her husband Warren Brewer two years ago to a brain tumour and has fought to preserve his sperm ever since.

The couple had planned to have a family together, with Mr Brewer making it clear before he died that his wife should have the chance to have their child.

The law allows sperm and eggs to be 
stored for up to 55 years.

But when Mr Brewer died at 32 in February 
2012, he had not given consent for this and a storage time limit imposed
 by the UK fertility regulator meant his sperm could only be held for 
three further years.

Mrs Warren said this did not give her time to 
decide whether she wanted a family or not – and went against everything 
she and her husband had intended.

Yesterday Mrs Warren burst into 
tears as a High Court judge ruled the deadline should be extended to 
protect the couple’s human right to a family life.

Mrs Warren said: 'Warren was my life. I know we didn't get that life we wanted. So we made this plan. Now I feel I can just move on in my life. With what I want to do. With this chance Warren left me'

Judge Mrs Justice Hogg, who heard evidence at a hearing in the Family 
Division of the High Court in London in January, ruled in Mrs Warren's 
favour today. She added: 'May I also add my great sympathy for her. She 
fell in love with a man, cared for him and loved him'

Though the case 
is unique, it is thought to be the first time such a judgement has been 
made.

Judge Mrs Justice 
Hogg, who heard evidence at a hearing in the Family Division of the High
 Court in London in January, said Mr Warren 'wished to keep open his 
option to become a father of his own child.

'Notwithstanding
 his wishes and intentions, Mr Brewer did not provide written consent as
 required by the regulation, nor did he provide the requisite medical 
certificate.

'I am satisfied had he known what was required he would have done that which was necessary.

'As it was he was not given the information, not advised and thus did not fulfil the requirement of the regulations.

'I
 have held that Mrs Warren has a right under Article 8 in that she has 
the right to decide to become a parent by her deceased husband, for 
which he had made provision and which would accord with his wishes and 
intention. For these reasons, I have made the declaration.

'May I also add my great sympathy for her. She fell in love with a man, cared for him and loved him.

'I
 wish her and Mr Brewster's parent well, and ultimately whatever her 
decision may be I wish her and the family much happiness after such a 
difficult and sad time'.

Mrs Warren gasped when the judge announced her decision.

Speaking after the hearing, an emotional Mrs Warren said she was 'elated'.

'I
 hadn't let myself believe that I was going to get that. I need to have a
 think now move forward with my life, build it back up again and find 
happiness really.'

She added: 'I don't know where to start. Thank you to everyone who helped me. I am a little bit overwhelmed.'

She
 went on: 'Warren was my life. I know we didn't get that life we wanted.
 So we made this plan. Now I feel I can just move on in my life. With 
what I want to do. With this chance Warren left me.'

Mrs Warren said she would advise 
anyone in the situation she and her husband had been in to contact their
 clinic and make sure paperwork was properly completed.

She added: 'I really want to make sure it doesn't happen again.'

The physiotherapist from Birmingham previously told the High Court 
that her late husband would not have wanted to place a time limit on her
 conceiving his child.

She said: 'I'm sure there's no way he would have wished to limit the length of time I could conceive in this situation.

'We
 made plans to spend the rest of our lives together and plans for what 
we would do if he didn't get better so I know there's no limit on the 
amount of time for me.

'Every form we got from the clinic we read and signed'.

The court heard that the last consent form that Mr Warren ever signed was on January 2, 2012.

He had returned to the couple's home for New Year celebrations having been staying in a hospice.

'We
 woke up that morning and Warren couldn't stand up - we wanted him 
longer at home but he had to return to the hospice', Mrs Warren added.

'That's
 why it was on January 2 that everything was signed, we spent New Years'
 together, it was the next day we arranged to go back to the hospice'.

Mrs Warren was granted permission to store her late husband's sperm beyond April 2015.

A
 lawyer representing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority 
(HFEA) had earlier  told the judge that officials sympathised with Mrs 
Warren.

But Jane Collier 
said Mr Brewer, a ski instructor, had not given the proper written 
consent to his sperm being stored beyond April 2015.

Argument: The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said it had 'every sympathy' with Ms Warren but says that they have 'no discretion' over the timings

A
 lawyer representing Mrs Warren told the judge that the authority was 
taking an 'excessively linguistic and technical approach' and suggested 
that every option had not been made clear to Mr Brewer.

Jenni
 Richards QC said Mr Brewer wanted to ensure that his sperm could be 
used by his wife after his death and had made his intentions clear.

Mrs Warren said: 'I am elated. Every good word in the dictionary. I hadn't dared to let myself believe it would happen.'

Mrs 
Warren, who put her studies and career on hold to care for her dying 
husband, earlier said: ‘I am still trying to make myself happy again - you don't have a child because you are lonely and heartbroken.

'I need to make myself whole again. I want to be financially settled as
 well, so that my child can have everything I had.

'I am just a normal 
person who loved someone very, very much and lost them.'

She 
added: 'We just fell head over heels in love. It was a long time ago 
that we made plans that when we are engaged and married we would have 
children.

'Ideally we'd have a boy and a girl and we talked about names. I am just trying to do the right thing.

'I have the full support of Warren's family in my legal battle and in 
whatever decision I make, and they have told me how proud they are of 
how I am dealing with the situation.'
