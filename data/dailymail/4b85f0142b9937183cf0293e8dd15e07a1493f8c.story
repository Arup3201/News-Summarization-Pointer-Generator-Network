A man has lost an incredible 11st and transformed his life after his wife casually signed them up to Weight Watchers after a night out.

Chris Eichfeld's, 39, from Washington DC, story is made all the more remarkable by the fact he achieved his weight loss while in his job at a fast food company.

Rather than a eureka moment or dramatic event, Chris's weight loss began in an almost accidental way.

Chris has managed to drop from 23st (left) to a trim 10st 7lbs (right, with his wife Diane, who also lost weight alongside Chris ) through a calorie controlled diet

Chris was out for dinner with his wife Diana, 39, to celebrate her birthday when she casually mentioned that a voucher they had received for Weight Watchers membership was about to expire, and that she planned to sign them both up.

That spur of the moment decision began a year long journey which saw both Diana and Chris totally transform their diets and lives, with the result that Chris dropped over 11st (154lb) in weight.

Chris struggled with his weight throughout his childhood, often suffering from lung infections meaning sports were difficult for him.

‘I had asthma and my father smoked and I always had bronchitis. Consequently, running wasn’t easy and I was never overly good at sports. So there was just food. The way we ate as a family was always a meat, a potato and then a starchy vegetable covered in butter and massive portions.

‘My father, my mother and my sister were all overweight. We were just a fat family. We were your typical American fat family and I was just terrified of it.’

Chris and Diana, pictured here with their son Aidan, were previously eating a high fat diet, which included a lot of red meat, dairy products, bread and chips

Although Chris grew up and found love with Diana, welcoming a son, Aidan, now 9, and finding a fulfilling job working in the catering industry, his weight continued to be an issue for him.

‘I worked in hotels, restaurants and I was constantly around food. I never put myself in a position to be successful with weight loss. Part of my issue was not just what I ate, but how much of it I ate. I had no self-control, I wouldn’t have one sandwich, I’d have two.  There was no sense of portioning or restraint.

‘My wife and I always wanted to lose weight but we just never had the self-motivation. We always said it would be great and then never did anything about it.’

At 6ft Chris, who works at Five Guys Burgers and Fries, had reached 23st  (322lb) when his wife signed him up to Weight Watchers.

When Diane signed them both up to the slimming group after her birthday meal, Chris did not hold much hope for success, but found the gradual reduction of calories and online services offered meant the process was not as daunting as he had expected.

Despite his colossal weight loss, Chris says the main effect has been the way those around him have reacted to his drastically changed appearance (Chris before his weight loss, left, and now, right)

‘When the 
weight started coming off, I thought, I can do this. What helped for me 
was that fruits and unprocessed vegetables are zero points so you can 
snack on those all the time. I can eat those all day.

'I started out and I said ok – let me get below 300lbs. That was 20lb. Then I said - let me hit 270.

'Then I thought, I can lose 100lb.’

The
 family swapped their high fat diet, which included a lot of red meat, 
dairy products, bread and chips, for a largely home-made, unprocessed 
food with lots of fruit and vegetables.

As the weight began to fall off, Chris was able to become more active and began running

Despite
 not finding the diet too much of a struggle, Chris says having the 
support of his wife, who was following the plan alongside him, was a 
huge help.

I
 didn’t do the meetings but I had my wife. We had the same foods. We 
could talk to each other and share ideas. There wasn’t bad foods in the 
pantry.

‘Finally, when we got it, the weight loss came easily and it wasn’t as much of a challenge as I thought it would be. It also helped us get athletic. Being lighter enabled us to run, to get out and be more active.’

Chris, pictured with his son Aidan after completing the the Run or Dye race, says he now realises that he was not happy when he was overweight

But despite losing 11st (154lb) - half his body weight,-  Chris says much of the change has been a shift in the perception others had of him.

‘I’ve learned is that you never really see yourself as heavy as you are and you never really see yourself as thin as you are. You need someone outside to give you that perspective.

'People I worked with after I lost the weight said to me, “Man, I was worried about you, you would be out of breath walking down the corridor.” And I just had no idea. I chose not to see that about myself.’

Now maintaining his new low weight and enjoying a new active and healthy lifestyle, Chris says that, despite slightly falling into his diet by accident, he realises he wasn’t happy at his former size.

'I look back and see I was angry. I didn’t realise it, but I was angry. I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin and if you’re not OK with yourself then you’ll make everyone else around you miserable.'
