Two teenagers are dead and another three seriously injured after they were hit by a missile strike while playing football on a school sports field in Donetsk.

The football pitch, located in the rebel controlled territory of eastern Ukraine, had holes blown through its fence and the turf ripped apart by the wayward bombs.

Locals said the bombing occurred yesterday about 2 - 3km from Donetsk airport, where separatists have been fighting with government forces despite a ceasefire declared on September 5.

Kiev said on Wednesday it would halt payment of state funds in areas controlled by pro-Moscow rebels, as both sides hardened positions in what is rapidly becoming a 'frozen conflict': a long-term stalemate that the West believes is Russia's aim.

A day after the rebels held inauguration ceremonies for their leaders, the separatists and the central government each accused each other of violating the September peace deal and signalled they would withdraw support for some of its terms.

The past four days have seen the rebels stage elections for leadership which the government called illegal, and the government respond by saying it would revoke a law that would have granted eastern regions autonomy and sent them cash.

The rebels say their newly elected leaders must be allowed to negotiate with Kiev directly; Kiev says this is impossible.

And while sporadic conflict continues, both sides' positions mean they have reversed parts of the 12-point peace plan agreed in Belarus in September.

With Kiev lacking the military might to break the rebels by force, Western allies now fear that a large chunk of Ukrainian territory will become a Russian protectorate with a parlous economic future, beyond the writ of the central government.

Yury Yakimenko, a political analyst at Ukraine's Razumkov political research centre, said: 'We have now realistically entered the phase of a 'frozen conflict.'

The term 'frozen conflict' is usually applied to other ex-Soviet republics where separatist enclaves have been protected by Russian troops since the early 1990s.

The American general who serves as the highest ranking NATO officer also said this week that the conditions for a frozen conflict were being created in Ukraine.
