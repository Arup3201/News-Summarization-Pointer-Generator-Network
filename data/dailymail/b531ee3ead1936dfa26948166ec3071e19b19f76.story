Jasem Emwazi took his son Mohammed (pictured) to London when the boy was six years old 

The father of Jihadi John was a police officer in Kuwait before the family moved to Britain, according to a former friend.

Jasem Emwazi took his wife, children and eldest son Mohammed, then six, to start a new life in London in 1994.

'Jasem was in the police like many Bedoons,' said the friend.

Meanwhile, a senior Kuwaiti military source suggested that, in common with many of his Bedoon ethnic group who originally stemmed from Southern Iraq, Mr Emwazi would have found it difficult to regain his police job in Kuwait following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the 1991 Gulf War.

'Many Bedoon joined the Kuwaiti police and military in the 70s and 80s, even though they were not citizens of Kuwait,' said the friend who knew the family when they lived in the scruffy enclave of Taima, ten miles from Kuwait City.

Recently retired Kuwait army colonel Fahad Al-Shilaimi said many of the stateless Bedoon were sacked from the police in the early 1990s.

'In the days after Saddam's men left, anyone with a link to Iraq found their loyalty questioned, and many were sacked. Perhaps that was the reason the family left Kuwait.'

He added that the Kuwaiti authorities would now be investigating Mohammed Emwazi's activities in Kuwait when he returned there for a computer job in 2009-10.

The Kuwaiti Ministry of the Interior is conducting a 'major investigation' into Jihadi John's eight months in the emirate, a senior security expert said.

'They will be looking into every facet of his life: his friends, his colleagues, his girlfriend, his communications,' said Al-Shilaimi. 'They will want to know which mosque he went to and who he spent time with. Many will be interrogated as the ministry wants to make sure any IS sympathisers are identified.'

The colonel also said that MI5 may have 'failed' the Kuwaitis by not alerting them to Emwazi's trip there in 2009, only months after he was deported from Tanzania.

'It is concerning that Kuwait may have been failed by MI5. If we had known, we could have questioned him or put him under surveillance,' he said.
