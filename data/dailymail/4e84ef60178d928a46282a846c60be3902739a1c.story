A giggly drunk driver in Florida stopped laughing when her charges were upgraded to felonies after she slipped her cuffs and ate a bag of marijuana found in her car.

A camera inside the state trooper's squad car shows Tavish Smith, 45, munching away on the bud after grabbing the evidence from the front seat.

Smith was arrested last Thursday night after she crashed her car outside Cocoa, Florida. 

WKMG-TV reports that she crashed her truck, drove the wrong way up a highway and rolled it over in a ditch.

Eating the evidence: Tavis Smith, 46, is pictured here scarfing down marijuana that was seized from her car after she slipped her cuffs

Smith, who works for a judge, played coy when she was arrested and proceeded to giggle - until her charges were upgraded

Video shows her giggling and calling officers 'handsome' as she is cuffed for driving under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident.

Troopers add a possession of marijuana after they found a baggie full of the drug in her car.

Still, Smith was un-phased and continued giggling in the back of the squad car.

Once the trooper left her alone, she woofed down the marijuana in the baggie.

Smith allegedly crashed her car, drove the wrong way up a highway and then crashed again Thursday night

When she got back, she had crumbs on her face and on the seat. 

'Bags of weed just don't go missing inside a police car. And I've got it all on video,' the trooper tells Smith.

Police said between the residue left on Smith's face and the little bit of the drug left in the baggie, they have enough proof to charge her with destruction of evidence.

Smith has been suspended from her job working for a Brevard County, Florida, judge after the arrest.
