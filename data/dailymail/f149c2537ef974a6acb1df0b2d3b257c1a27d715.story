Former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne today lost his appeal against being asked to pay £77,750 towards his prosecution costs

Former cabinet minister Chris Huhne was today ordered to pay £77,750 towards the cost of prosecuting him for passing speeding points to his ex-wife.

Mr Huhne had launched an appeal against the bumper bill ordered in May – but three judges today threw out his case.

Prosecutors had originally demanded more than £100,000 from Mr Huhne, who pleaded guilty last February.

His former wife, the economist Vicky Pryce, who was convicted by a jury, was ordered to pay £49,200.

Mr Huhne and Ms Pryce served prison sentences for perverting the course of justice after she took speeding points for her then-husband in 2003.

The speeding points scandal brought about the end of Mr Huhne's political career, forcing him to stand down as a cabinet minister and later to resign as an MP.

At the conclusion of the hearing, Mr Huhne, 60, was ordered to pay an extra £1,279 prosecution costs relating to the appeal court proceedings.

Mr Huhne's had insisted the sum the judge ordered him to pay was 'unjust', but the court said the £77,000 costs were 'just and reasonable'.

Oliver Glasgow, defending the prosecution, said Mr Huhne 'sought to play the system and lost'.

He told the court it was a 'gamble he took', and 'he knew if he lost it would cost him dearly'.

Mr Huhne admitted last year asking Pryce to take his speeding points to avoid losing his licence, and Pryce was convicted of having agreed to do so.

The pair were charged over an incident in March 2003 when Huhne's BMW car was caught by a speed camera on the M11 motorway between Stansted Airport in Essex and London.

He was an MEP at the time and in danger of losing his licence, having already accrued nine penalty points.

The costs order was made in May by Mr Justice Sweeney at Southwark Crown Court, who rejected Huhne's legal team's original offer of £25,000.

Pryce, who was convicted by a jury last year, was ordered to pay £49,200.

During Pryce's trial, the prosecution alleged that she had chosen to take the points but later plotted to expose Huhne after he revealed he was having an affair with an aide and ended the couple's 26-year marriage.
