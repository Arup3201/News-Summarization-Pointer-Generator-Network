At least 14 people were killed and 23 injured in the Pakistani city of Quetta on Saturday, after a bomb exploded on a bus in a university campus and militants released a second bomb as they stormed the hospital where victims were being treated.

The first blast ripped through a bus standing on the campus of Sardar Bahadur Khan Women's University at Brewery Road while the students and faculty members were waiting to go home.

Many women sustained severe burn injuries as the explosion triggered a fire. TV footage showed flames and black smoke emerging from the bus, which was reduced to a blackened heap of metal.

Police officials said 14 female students were killed. About an hour later, another blast occurred inside the Bolan Medical Complex where the 23 injured, mostly students, were being taken in.

The historic building that was blown up by militants in Ziarat had been the residence of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan

Several militants began firing indiscriminately inside the hospital killing Quetta deputy commissioner Abdul Mansoor Kakar as reported by Geo News channel.

Many civil and police officials, including the police chief and chief secretary of Balochistan, were also inside the hospital.

No group claimed responsibility for both the attacks, which came hours after militants attacked and destroyed the historic 121-year-old building in Ziarat, about 120 km from Quetta, that was used by Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the last days of his life.

A policeman was killed in that attack, which was claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army militants.

District police chief Asghar Ali said a bomb disposal squad had found and defused six more bombs, each containing about three kilograms of explosives.

Another bomb attack was carried out at a security check-post in the North Nazimabad area of Karachi. Eight people, including two paramilitary personnel and a policeman, were injured in the attack.
