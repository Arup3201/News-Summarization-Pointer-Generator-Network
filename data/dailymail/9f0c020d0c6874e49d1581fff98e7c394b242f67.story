Jailed: English Defence League founder Stephen Lennon has been sentenced to ten months in prison for using a friend's passport to enter the U.S.

The leader of the English Defence League was today jailed for 10 months after admitting using someone else's passport to travel to the United States.

Stephen Lennon, 30, pleaded guilty to possession of a false identity document with improper intention, contrary to the Identity Documents Act 2010, at Southwark Crown Court.

Lennon used a passport in the name of Andrew McMaster to board a Virgin Atlantic flight from Heathrow to New York, but was caught out after his fingerprints were taken by customs officials.

He left the airport and entered the U.S. illegally but left the country the following day, using his own passport to return to the UK.

The court heard that Lennon, who had previously been refused entry to the U.S., used his friend's passport to travel to the country in September.

He used a self check-in kiosk to board the Virgin Atlantic flight at Heathrow, and was allowed through when the document was checked in the bag drop area.

But when he arrived at New York's JFK Airport, customs officials who took his fingerprints realised he was not Mr McMaster.

Lennon was asked to attend a second interview but left the airport, entering the U.S. illegally.

He stayed just one night and travelled back to the UK the following day using his own legitimate passport - which bears the name Paul Harris.

The court heard that is the name that appears on the EDL leader's passport, although he uses aliases.

Lennon, who was arrested in October, was jailed for 10 months today.

The court heard that he was previously jailed for assault in 2005 and also has previous convictions for drugs offences and public order offences.

Sentencing the 30-year-old, Judge Alistair McCreath, told him: 'I am going to sentence you under the name of Stephen Lennon although I suspect that is not actually your true name, in the sense that it is not the name that appears on your passport.

'What I have to deal with you for is clear enough.

'You knew perfectly well that you were not welcome in the United States.

'You knew that because you tried before and you had not got in, and you knew the reason for that - because, rightly or wrongly, the U.S. authorities do not welcome people in their country who have convictions of the kind that you have.

'With that full knowledge, you equipped yourself with a passport. I am told that it was given you by way of a loan from your friend Andrew McMaster, to which you bore, I am told, some resemblance.

'And by use of that passport you did what you could to get into the United States.

'But you did not get in because they took your fingerprints and they worked out that you were not who you claimed to be.

'I am told that, by whatever means, you slipped away from the U.S. authorities, got into the country and then very rapidly - and understandably so - got out of it.'

He said Lennon had used his own passport to get out of the U.S., adding: 'You did so, I am quite sure, in order to avoid the consequences that would have fallen upon you had you been caught by the authorities in America.'

The judge went on: 'What you did went absolutely to the heart of the immigration controls that the United States are entitled to have.

'Had it been known in this country that you were proposing to leave under a false passport, you would not have been accepted on to the plane and you would not have been permitted to leave this country on a false passport.

'It's not in any sense trivial.'

He sentenced Lennon to 10 months in prison, minus the days he has already served in custody.

Prosecutor Simon Sandford said it was the Crown's case that Lennon committed the offence while on bail for breaching an International Football Banning Order - of which the court heard he was acquitted.

Opening the case, Mr Sandford told the court: 'On Monday September 10 2012, the defendant travelled from Heathrow Airport to New York on a Virgin Atlantic flight, travelling using a passport in the name of Andrew McMaster, believed to be a colleague of the defendant.

'He checked in using a self check-in kiosk at Heathrow before proceeding to the baggage drop area.

'The defendant then proceeded through security and boarded the flight.'

He added: 'Upon arrival in New York, he was the subject of immigration checks as with everybody else.

'He identified himself to the United States Customs and Border Protection officials as Andy McMaster.'

Lennon passed through Heathrow on the passport without incident, but suspicions were raised at New York's JFK Airport

Photographs and fingerprints were taken, and U.S. customs officials realised that Lennon was not who he said he was.

'He had been previously refused entry to the U.S. on the grounds of his previous convictions and he was directed to attend a secondary investigation but he did not report for that,' the prosecutor said.

'He left the immigration and customs area, entered the United States unlawfully and then he returned to Heathrow, via Shannon Airport, and used his passport in the name of Paul Harris, which is a name he does go by.'

The court heard that although Lennon has only one passport, which is in that name, he uses aliases.

US officials produced fingerprints and photographs proving that Lennon was not Mr McMaster, the court heard, and there was also CCTV from JFK Airport showing him arriving.

Lennon was arrested in October and did not reply to questions in interview.

In mitigation, his defence barrister, Giles Cockings, told the court that Lennon had not stolen the passport, and had only used it for a day.

He told the court his client had pleaded guilty straightaway, demonstrating 'a certain amount of courage'.

'Firstly, this passport was not stolen, it was lent by a friend for whatever purpose,' he told the court.

'Secondly, he was only using the passport, it transpires, for a day and a half. In fact he only spent one evening in the United States of America.

"I think the intention was simply to avoid a necessity for a visa into the United States.

'Upon realising that in actual fact it was not going to assist matters, on realising he had committed an offence, he used his own passport to come back.

'It is not, I would suggest, the most aggravating of cases of this kind.'

The EDL has held many demonstrations across the country since it was formed in Luton in March 2009 after Muslim radicals disrupted a homecoming parade by the Royal Anglian Regiment.

It has become the most significant far-right street movement in Britain since the National Front in the Seventies.
