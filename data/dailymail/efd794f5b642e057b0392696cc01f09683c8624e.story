The police chief whose force is investigating the hospital insulin poisonings has likened the probe to the Agatha Christie mystery 'Murder on the Orient Express' – but on a massive scale.

In the much-loved whodunit, Hercule Poirot had to contend with 12 suspects, any of whom could have carried out a brutal killing on the iconic train.

But following the dramatic release of the sole suspect, nurse Rebecca Leighton, detectives are having to examine a bewildering 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluids at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport.

Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said the challenge facing officers was not only to prove that one of them was responsible for the poisoning, but also to conclusively eliminate all the others.

‘We have a situation where 700 people may have had access to the crime scene and yet we have to show that no one else could be involved,’ he told the BBC.

‘It is like Murder on the Orient Express but with a lot more people on the train.

‘The situation is almost unique. Normally in a murder in a house or a pub you can quickly establish who was at the scene. This will take many months.’

Rebecca Leighton, pictured, now plans to sue 
police for a six-figure sum, claiming wrongful arrest, or trying to gain
compensation worth up to £1million

Innocent: Miss Leighton and her fiancé Tim Papworth yesterday

Challenge: Peter Fahy says hundreds must be eliminated from probe

Mr Fahy admitted that the fact that 
the ward at the centre of the investigation had remained open throughout 
further complicated police inquiries.

‘We
did discuss shutting one ward with the hospital, but it was decided 
that moving people out of a ward could pose a risk to their welfare,’ he
said.

And he confirmed 
fears that the number of agency staff – some from abroad – passing 
through the hospital over the period at the centre of the inquiry 
represented a further hurdle.

‘It is a very complex investigation, 700 people had access to a crime scene that was never shut.

‘And
the transient nature of some hospital staff - who may have moved on - 
is another difficulty we have to face - tracking them down.

‘Our nightmare was that we could have another death. Nothing has happened since we got involved.'

Miss
Leighton, 27, spent more than six weeks in custody after the deaths of 
five elderly patients were linked to suspected saline drip poisoning.

She was released last Friday when all charges against her were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Her
lawyer said she had been made a scapegoat by police who felt under 
pressure to end the ‘chaos’ surrounding the case and that she now wanted
to overturn her suspension and return to nursing.

Mr
Fahy admitted his officers had been under pressure, but he insisted the
decision to charge her hadn’t been rushed by police or the Crown 
Prosecution Service (CPS).

‘It
is common sense that officers were under pressure to make sure there 
was not another occurrence of contamination at the hospital,’ he said.

‘That did not translate into a decision to charge.

‘The CPS set high standards. The evidence was assessed by the CPS who still decided to charge.’

Mr Fahy also controversially backed a call from leading barrister John Cooper QC for crime suspects to be given anonymity.

Wrongly accused: Chris Jefferies was arrested after the death of his tenant Joanna Yeates

He
used as an example the case of Christopher Jefferies, the landlord who 
was arrested for the murder of Joanna Yates in Bristol and later freed 
without being charged.

‘It is really difficult when you see senior detectives agonising over whether to make an arrest or not.

‘Realising
that this is what's going to happen, that there's going to be a media 
furore and this person's reputation is going to be completely ruined.

‘I
don't want to comment about this particular case, but in general there 
was the case in Bristol where the landlord got horribly portrayed in the
media and eventually was found completely innocent.

‘So I totally support what the QC has said I think there should be a ban on people certainly until they've been charged.’

Fans
of Agatha Christie’s well-loved crime novel will know that Poirot 
establishes the unlikely solution to the mystery facing him - that all 
12 suspects took part in the 'Murder on the Orient Express'.

Police
in Stockport are continuing to probe the deaths of Tracey Arden, 44, 
Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83, and the deaths of a further 
four unnamed victims.

Officers believe another 33 people may also have been potential victims of contamination but survived.
