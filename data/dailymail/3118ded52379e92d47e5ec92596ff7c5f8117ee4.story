Donald Sterling tried to bribe his mistress V.Stiviano into saying she doctored tapes of the Los Angeles Clippers owner making offensive racist statements.

Clippers President Andy Roeser also tried to cover-up the recordings before they were released by TMZ last month, according to a report by the NBA's chief investigator.

Chief investigator David B Anders has compiled a 30-page report on the scandal, along with hundreds of pages of supporting statements, ahead of a June 3 hearing in which the 29 other NBA owners will vote on whether to force Sterling to sell his team.

Bribe: A new report by the NBA's chief investigator reveals Donald Sterling tried to bribe his mistress V. Stiviano (pictured out in LA yesterday) into saying she doctored tapes in which he was recoded making racist statements

The Los Angeles Times reviewed the confidential report, which found that Sterling, 80, tried to pay off his mistress just before she sat down for a televised interview with Barbara Walters.

Sterling showed up at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons, where the interview was being taped on May 2, and asked 31-year-old Stiviano to make a payment to his wife.

Sterling's 79-year-old wife Shelly, had brought up a lawsuit against Stiviano before recordings were released in which Sterling can be heard telling his much-younger mistress not to bring black people to Clippers games or post with them in pictures.

Shelly accused Stiviano of swindling cash, real estate and cars from her family.

If Stiviano paid what Shelly wanted, 'Mr Sterling said that he would return the value of that payment to Ms Stiviano through back channels,' the investigator said. 

In exchange, Sterling asked Stiviano to say publicly that she doctored the recordings.

But Sterling ended up leaving the hotel in a huff when Stiviano called her lawyers into a conference room and asked Sterling to repeat his offer in front of them.

And that wasn't the first time Sterling tried to lie about the recordings.

Wasn't me: NBA's chief investigator David Anders says Sterling lied to him, saying his statements had been altered in the tape

The day after the recordings were released, Sterling put out a statement saying: 'We have heard the tape on TMZ We do not know if it is legitimate or if it has been altered.'

The NBA called this statement  intentionally misleading since Sterling knew it was his voice on the tapes.

The also say he lied to Anders when the NBA's investigator called him up, saying he didn't make some of the statements and that certain comments had been altered.

He said that he told Stiviano not to bring 'gangbangers' to games - not black people in general or ex-NBA star Magic Johnson specifically.

The investigation also revealed that the recordings first surfaced on April 9 - more than two weeks before TMZ aired the clips.

Stiviano first sent those tapes to Clippers management, and an employee testified that team President Andy Roeser ordered him to delete evidence of the clips along Stiviano's text messages.

He knew: The report found that Clippers President Andy Roeser found out about the tapes two weeks before they were released and tried to have them destroyed. Pictured above at a press conference in 2011. He has since been placed on indefinite leave by the league

'The employee at first questioned Mr. Roeser, asking him if he was sure that the employee should delete the files,' the summary said. 'Mr. Roeser said he was sure.'

Roeser is currently on indefinite leave from the league.

The report is also trying to make a case for pushing Shelly Sterling from Clippers ownership, since she independently owns 50 per cent of the team.

Shelly has been making a public case for keeping her stake, distancing herself from her husband by saying they are estranged and have been living apart.

But the NBA has refuted these claims in the report, which found found that Shelly spent the two days after the scandal with her husband.

She was even recorded leaving a downtown LA restaurant with her husband after the scandal, and when asked by a reporter if she thinks he's a racist, appears to say 'of course not'.

Her lawyer contends that she thought the reporter was asking her if she was racist.

They also say that the Sterlings attended nearly every Clippers home game together this season, along with traveling to the New Orleans All-Star game in February.

Sterling has until May 27 to respond to the accusations, and the league has already shot down a request for his attorney for a three month extension to work on their case.

When the recordings were first released, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver hit Sterling with a $2.5million fine and banned him from the league for life.

At a hearing on June 3, the NBA owners will convene to vote on whether to force Sterling from his team. The team could come up for sale if three-quarters of the 29 owners agree.

Next steps: The 29 other NBA owners will convene on June 3 for a vote to force Sterling to sell his team. Above, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver (center) speaks with Magic Johnson (right) at a Clippers game on May 11
