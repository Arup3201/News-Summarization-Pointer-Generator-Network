Overnight trips to Rome could become even more expensive as the Italian capital considers hiking its hotel tax just four months after it was doubled.

The proposal calls for the tourist tax to increase to €10 a night (approximately £7.60) at five-star hotels, according to local media, despite fears that it would deter tourists from planning a holiday in The Eternal City.

It comes after Rome’s government hiked the tax to between €3 and €7, depending on the type of hotel, last September.

Tourists would be forced to pay even more while staying in Rome if the city's hikes its luxury hotel tax

The Italian Hotel Association, which represents angry hotel owners, announced that it is ‘concerned’ by Rome’s decision to increase the tax at luxury hotels.

Giorgio Palmucci, the association’s president, told media that the local council ‘takes no account of the dynamics of the tourist market that could be an important key to development and jobs for the city.’

He questioned whether tourists would see any additional services following another tax increase and pointed out that cities such as London and Madrid do not apply a tourist tax, while Paris’ tax is ‘marginal’.

He added: ‘There is no doubt that such a chose will not have negative impact on businesses but also on the image of the city.’

Hotelier Steve Brenner told The Local that a tax increase for luxury hotels would affect the broader tourism industry, calling it a ‘very shirt-sighted plan’ from an ‘out of touch’ government.

The owner of The Beehive Hotel in central Rome said: ‘I had ten people come in the other day. It was €157 in tourist tax for their stay, I was embarrassed.’

He said he has seen little evidence that the tax is being used to improve services for tourists or residents.

Rome's hotel association fears another tax increase would deter tourists from planning a holiday in the city

Last September, when the tourist tax was doubled, the World Travel & Tourism Council said hotels risked losing business as it would drive tourists away and heavily punish Rome’s travel and tourism sector.

It said the ‘punitive’ tax sends the message that travellers are not welcome in Rome and its tourism industry ‘does not matter’.

The organisation is calling on the ‘counter-productive’ tax, which was introduced in 2010, to be scrapped.
