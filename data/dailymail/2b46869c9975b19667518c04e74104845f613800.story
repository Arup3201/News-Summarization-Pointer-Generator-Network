Like any proud Welshwomen, they wanted to celebrate St David’s Day.

But when these friends arrived at Harrods in national costume, the celebrations came to an abrupt end.

Their outfits of tall black hats, red skirts and white aprons apparently didn’t meet the dress code of the exclusive London store.

The Welsh women were celebrating St David's Day in London, but were refused entry to top department store Harrods because of their traditional dress

Out for a fun time: The group said they were smartly dressed and well behaved on their national day

A uniformed woman security officer told them: ‘You can’t come in here dressed like that.’

The group, including a doctor, an NHS manager, a lawyer and a fashion designer, had spent £200 on their traditional costumes to make sure March 1 – the day the Welsh honour their patron saint St David – was one to remember.

They were on a weekend theatre trip to London from their homes in Bridgend, South Wales, and a trip to the Harrods champagne bar was on their itinerary.

Yesterday Harrods apologised for the blunder, and pointed out that the women were allowed in after security checks.

The six travelled from Bridgend, South Wales, to London for a theatre break weekend - and said everyone enjoyed their festive costumes

It was only when the women protested that they were being racially discriminated against that the store backed down

Trip organiser Gaynor Newton, 56, said: ‘We were gobsmacked – we were smartly dressed and well behaved on our national day.

‘The first woman security officer who stopped us was quite rude and just said we could not enter the store because we were in our national costume. As we stood there an Asian woman in a sari and an African woman in lovely colourful robes both entered the store without a problem.

‘Everywhere we went people were happy to see us and wanted their photographs taken with us, until we got to Harrods where we were shocked by the way the staff treated us.’

The women were eventually let in but say they were shocked by the way they were treated

It was only when the women protested that they were being racially discriminated against that staff backed down. Knitwear designer Denise Evans, 50, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it – would they stop a Scotsman from entering Harrods in his kilt? I don’t think so.’

Harrods yesterday apologised, saying it was a misunderstanding.

‘The security guard asked for the group to wait while she double-checked it was in keeping with our dress code,’ a spokesman said.

‘The women didn’t want to wait and went to another entrance where they were admitted, as by that time the security team were aware they were wearing national dress.

‘We certainly did not deny them entry and always welcome all  visitors in national costume. We apologise for any confusion.’

Harrods today apologised saying it was a misunderstanding and the women from Wales were welcome
