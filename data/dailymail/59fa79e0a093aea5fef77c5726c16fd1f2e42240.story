DeMarcus Cousins forgives but he doesn't forget. 

On Friday, the Sacramento Kings center, nicknamed Boogie, went on Instagram to gloat over a failed prediction made by blogger Clay Travis.

'There is a 100% chance that DeMarcus Cousins is arrested for something in the next five years,' Travis wrote in 2010. '100%. Write it in stone.' 

Travis didn't give a reason for the claim, which he made when Cousins was a 19-year-old freshman playing at University of Kentucky.

Victory lap: On Friday,  Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus 'Boogie' Cousins went on Instagram to gloat over a failed prediction made by blogger Clay Travis

It clearly stuck with Cousins, who waited five long years spent without a legal scrape for the chance to prove Travis wrong on social media.

Posting on Instagram and Twitter, Cousins included a screenshot of the tweet and a caption: 'Today's the day!! Let's all show him some love!!'

A few hours later, Travis tweeted back to Cousins that he'd be donating to charity in his name for the tweet. 

'Funny and well played,' Travis wrote Friday. '$5k to your charity of choice. Let me know where to send it.' 

Travis, finally, did apologize - after some prodding.

Fellow sportswriter Matt Jones told Travis he'd said his prediction was wrong five years ago and Travis tweeted back: 'You were right. I was wrong. Sorry, Boogie.'

ESPN's Dave McMenamin spoke with Cousins before Sacramento's game on Friday about the tweet and the news Cousins would be playing in his first All-Star Game.

'I really didn't expect to get that type of reaction,' Cousins said about posting the tweet. 'But I mean, you guys know how I am.'

'I take a lot of things personal. Especially things like that. I hate how a guy judges from his job and then you try to make that his personality as a person. I just think it's completely unfair.'

Asked about his feelings on the donation that Travis said he'd make, Cousins said he didn't know about it. 

'Not bad,' he responded.
