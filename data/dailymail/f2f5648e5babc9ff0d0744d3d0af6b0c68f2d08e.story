The three Connecticut millenials charged with causing a disturbance at the singer's Rhode Island mansion are anything but your average vandals.

The trio - Michael Horrigan, 29, his roommate Tristan Kading, 28, and his sister Emily Kading, 26 - pleaded not guilty this week to hurling beer bottles and shouted expletives at security officers patrolling the star's seaside property.

However it has now been revealed they are all well-to-do twenty-somethings, who claim they were 'just drinking and it got out of hand'.

According to TMZ, Tristan Kading studied chemical oceanography, graduating from MIT.

Police in Westerly say 29-year-old Michael Horrigan and 28-year-old Tristan Kading of North Stonington and 26-year-old Emily Kading of Stonington allegedly hurled beer bottles and shouted expletives at security officers patrolling Taylor Swift's seaside property in Rhode Island

Vandalized: Taylor Swift, seen here in New York on July 14, was not at HER Rhode Island home when the incident occurred last month

He also received the Richard Montgomery Award for Achievement in Mathematics.

Emily Kading is a nuclear scientist specializing in agriculture and natural resources. 

She's also studying to be a nuclear physicist.

Both Tristan and Michael Horrigan have been given citations for heroism.

They were both working on a ferry crew on the Long Island Sound last May when a 12-year-old girl's canoe capsized.

Both men jumped in and saved her.

The three told TMZ they 'harbored no ill will toward Swift'.

They denied flipping off the security guards,

'They were simply throwing up the peace sign like Taylor does in her 22 music video,' Kading told the website.

Swift was not home at the time of the June 14 disturbance.

The Westerly Sun reports that the 
three appeared in 4th Division District Court on Friday, where they 
entered their not pleas before Judge Frank J. Cenerini.

This is not the first time Taylor has had trouble at the $17 million property, which she obtained in May 2013.

Police have made two trespassing arrests in the past year.

A 55-year-old man, Joseph Bernatche,  was said to have entered the premises to give the singer his phone number last year.

According
 to local police, Bernatche was charged with trespassing after handing a
 security guard a note to pass along to Swift, in late July.

Taylor Swift bought the ritzy Rhode Island weekender in May 2013 for $17 million

Outside Taylor Swift's Watch Hill mansion in Rhode Island, the entrance is guarded and tourists get a gentle reminder with her lyrics on a no trespassing sign that reads, 'I knew you were trouble when you walked in' from the singer's hit song

The sprawling home has five bedrooms and Swift stays there regularly, usually with friends

He is alleged to have trespassed in April 2013 on a similar mission.

The devoted fan's attorney, Michael J. Robinson, has been adamant that Bernatche never stepped onto Swift's property.

Robinson told RadarOnline: 'Mr Bernatche showed up and parked at the house next to Taylor Swift’s. He was carrying a note [with his phone number on it]'

After parking his vehicle, Bernatche is then said to have handed a note to a member of Swift’s security detail.

According
 to Robinson, his client told the guard: 'I’m not here to trespass. I’m 
just here to deliver this note. If you would kindly give this to Taylor 
Swift, that’s my sole purpose for being here.'

It was only minutes later that Bernatche was pulled off the road, near the star’s home, by police and booked for trespassing.

The
 middle-aged man’s son Brian Bernatche told RadarOnline that he was 
'flabbergasted' when he found out what his father had done.

Explaining: 'He talks about Taylor all the time, but I can't believe he did this.'
