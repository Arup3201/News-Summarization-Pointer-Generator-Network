Michelle Obama and her family ended their week-long trip to China with a visit to a reserve where they helped feed giant pandas before getting on the plane back home.

The U.S First Lady has been visiting the country on a good-will tour with her daughters Sasha, 12, and Malia, 15, as well as her mother Marian Robinson.

On the final day of the trip the family visited the Chengdu Panda Base, a reserve for about 80 giant pandas, where they were able to feed a number of the animals.

China has often sent pandas to other countries as a means to strengthen diplomatic relations.

The family also spent their final day with a Tibetan theme, having lunch in a Tibetan restaurant, meeting students who presented them with Tibetan silk scarves and tapping Tibetan prayer wheels.

Her staff said the restaurant choice in Chengdu city in southwest Sichuan province, which borders the Tibetan region, was in accordance with the American first lady's interest in the rights of minorities in China.

The rights of Tibetans is a touchy one between the Chinese and U.S. governments.

More than 100 people have self-immolated in ethnic Tibetan areas, including parts of Sichuan, since 2009 to protest Chinese restrictions on Buddhism and the denigration of the Tibetans' spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.

President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama last month over the objections of Beijing, which reviles him as a separatist.

As Mrs Obama entered the Zangxiang Teahouse in Chengdu she spun a row of 11 metal prayer wheels that lined an entry bridge to the restaurant.

Mrs Obama, her mother and two daughters were greeted by a group of students who presented the four with traditional Tibetan ceremonial long white scarves.

The Obamas were served traditional foods, including yak meat pie, boiled yak ribs, bread made with barley and yak butter tea.
