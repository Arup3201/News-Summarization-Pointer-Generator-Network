Nine in 10 rapes and other sexual assaults go unreported to police because women lack confidence in the criminal justice system, Britain's chief prosecutor will say today.

Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, is to reveal that convictions for rape have reached record levels but the true number of offences is far greater.

He will say that while more than 300,000 women are sexually assaulted each year, only one in 10 victims of a serious offence reports it to the police.

Campaigners have warned that the number of convictions is only the 'tip of an iceberg'.

Mr Starmer, who heads the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), will tell a gathering of criminal justice agencies and women's groups: 'We now deliver justice for 15,000 more women each year than we did just four years ago.

'And we do so within a different culture - one which challenges myths and stereotypes and should improve confidence in the criminal justice system.

'But while more than 300,000 women are sexually assaulted each year, while only one in 10 women who experience serious sexual assault report it to the police, and while conviction rates remain lower for these attacks than for other crimes, none of us can afford to stop working to improve further.'

The number of cases involving violence women and girls which have been prosecuted by the CPS has risen from 75,000 in 2007-08 to 91,000 in 2011-12.

Over the same period, the number of convictions rose from 52,000 to almost 67,000.

Mr Starmer is expected to say the rise can be partly explained by a 'cultural change' in the way such cases are dealt with.

He will say: 'The work of the service in recognising violence against women and girls as a unified, high-priority issue, championed at the most senior level nationally and in the areas, and addressed through new policies, training and the use of specialist staff, has delivered a cultural change.

'Cases are now judged entirely on the merits of the evidence: we have recognised that myths and stereotypes previously held have no place in our criminal justice system - and that we need to tackle them head on.'

Mr Starmer is chairing a case review panel to explore the handling of the prosecutions in Rochdale of nine Muslim men, mainly of Pakistani origin, who were found guilty of plying girls as young as 13 with drink and drugs and raping them.

He will say: 'Violence against women and girls is not a race issue, but what we do recognise is that the manifestation of abuse varies across communities and we have to discuss the issues and possible solutions together with those communities.'

Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Starmer added: 'I have asked for all our cases involving child exploitation to be looked at so we get a proper picture of all sorts of cases in their proper circumstances.'

Asked about recent child sex grooming case in Rochdale in which a gang of Asian men were jailed, he said: 'For my part I'm less concerned about ethnic backgrounds. If you focus on the victim it becomes clear that these are often very vulnerable groups of individuals.

'Why is it that these people presented as victims. Why was it that they were not taken as seriously as they should have been.'

Mr Starmer is also expected to talk about the issue of teenage relationship abuse, where there remains a low volume of prosecutions and explain how a National Scrutiny Panel he is hosting will look at six recent cases and work out recommendations.

He will mention female genital mutilation, for which there have been no prosecutions.

'I am determined that we will find a way to bring offenders to account,' he will say.

Sandra Horley, chief executive of domestic violence charity Refuge, said: 'Refuge welcomes the recent CPS report which shows that the number of perpetrators being prosecuted for domestic violence has increased to 91,466 per year.

'Refuge has been campaigning for four decades to ensure that women and children are given the protection and justice they deserve and we commend the CPS for their efforts.

'Whilst we recognise these efforts are a step in the right direction, there is no room for complacency.

'Refuge remains concerned that the numbers of perpetrators prosecuted and subsequently convicted represents the tip of an iceberg.

'In London alone, there were almost 52,000 domestic violence offences recorded in one year, so the 66,860 successfully prosecuted nationally, barely scratches the surface.'Â
