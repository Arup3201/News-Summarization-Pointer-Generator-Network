America's East Coast was frequently battered by hurricanes as damaging as Katrina at a time when Europe was going through the Middle Ages.

This is according to sediments found beneath Salt Pond in Massachusetts which suggests that between the years 250 and 1150 more than 20 huge storms hit the area.

Scientists believe a change in sea surface temperatures in the western North Atlantic caused the storms — and they say climate change could cause them to return.

'These records suggest that the pre-historical interval was unlike what we've seen in the last few hundred years,' said Jeff Donnelly, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, who led the research.

The prehistoric hurricanes were likely category three storms, such as Hurricane Katrina, or category 4 storms, like Hurricane Hugo, that would be catastrophic if they hit the region today.

The study is the first to find evidence of historically unprecedented hurricane activity along the northern East Coast of the United States.

The most powerful storm to hit Cape Cod in recent times was Hurricane Bob in 1991, a category 2 storm that was one of the costliest in New England history.

Storms of that intensity have only reached the region three times since the 1600s, according to Professor Donnelly.

The intense prehistoric hurricanes were fuelled in part by warmer sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean than have been the norm off the U.S. East Coast over the last few hundred years.

However, as ocean temperatures have slowly inched upward in recent decades, tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperatures have surpassed the warmth of prehistoric levels--and are expected to warm more over the next century as the climate heats up, Professor Donnelly said.

'We hope this study broadens our sense of what is possible and what we should expect in a warmer climate,' he added.

The research is based on  sediments found beneath Salt Pond in Falmouth which suggests that, between the years 250 and 1150, more than 20 huge storms hit the area.

'We may need to begin planning for a category three hurricane landfall every decade or so rather than every 100 or 200 years.

'The risk may be much greater than we anticipated.'

The team looked at sediment deposits from Salt Pond near Falmouth on Cape Cod. The pond is separated from the ocean by a 4.3 to 5.9 ft (1.3 to 1.8 metres) high sand barrier.

Over hundreds of years, strong hurricanes have deposited sediment over the barrier and into the pond where it has remained undisturbed.

The researchers extracted 30ft (9 metre) deep sediment cores, which they then analysed in a laboratory.

Similar to reading a tree ring to tell the age of a tree and the climate conditions that existed in a given year, scientists can read a sediment core to determine when intense hurricanes occurred.

They found evidence of 32 prehistoric hurricanes, along with the remains of three documented storms that occurred in 1991, 1675 and 1635.

The sediments showed that there were two periods of intense hurricane activity on Cape Cod -- from 150 to 1150, and 1400 to 1675.

Droughts in the US Southwest and Central Plains during the last half of this century could be drier and longer than drought conditions seen in those regions in the last 1,000 years.

This is according to a Nasa study which combined projections from climate models, to find human-produced greenhouse gas emissions drives up the risk of severe droughts in these regions.

Natural droughts, like the 1930s Dust Bowl, and the current drought in the Southwest have historically lasted maybe a decade or a little less, said Ben Cook, a Nasa climate scientist.

'What these results are saying is we're going to get a drought similar to those events, but it is probably going to last at least 30 to 35 years,' he said.

According to Cook, the current likelihood of a megadrought, a drought lasting more than three decades, is 12 percent.

If greenhouse gas emissions stop increasing in the mid-21st century,Nasa projects the likelihood of megadrought to reach more than 60 per cent.

However, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase along current trajectories throughout the 21st century, there is an 80 per cent likelihood of a decades-long megadrought in the Southwest and Central Plains between the years 2050 and 2099.

The earlier period of powerful hurricane activity matched previous studies that found evidence of hurricanes during the same period in more southerly areas of the western North Atlantic Ocean basin - from the Caribbean to the Gulf Coast.

Powerful storms also battered more southerly U.S. coasts

These early storms were more frequent, and in some cases were likely more intense, than the most severe hurricanes Cape Cod has seen in historical times, including Hurricane Bob in 1991 and a 1635 hurricane that generated a 20-foot storm surge, according to Donnelly.

The hurricane activity continued in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico until 1400, although there was a lull during this time in New England.

A shift in hurricane activity in the North Atlantic occurred around 1400, when activity picked up from the Bahamas to New England, until about 1675.

'These records suggest that the pre-historical interval was unlike what we've seen in the last few hundred years,' said Jeff Donnelly, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, who led the research.
