Fly out for the Euro 2012 quarter-finals or stay at home to celebrate your anniversary with your partner.

This was the difficult decision that one man known only as Chris had to make. And if this banner, slung over a busy duel carriageway in Birmingham, is anything to go by Chris didn't choose very wisely.

England play Italy in the quarter-finals in Kiev on Sunday - and the football fan is believed to have flown out to watch his team in action.

Getting the message: A disgruntled woman wrote this message for her partner Chris after he chose the footie over her

But the supporter better start working on his apology after his disgruntled partner wrote: 'Chris, I hope the quarter finals are 
worth missing our anniversary for' in bright red paint on a huge white sheet.

Is that wasn't bad enough, the woman ended the message on the A38 between Birmingham and Sutton Coldfield with: 'Don't rush back!'

As excitement across the country builds, Dizzee Rascal is recording an 'emergency' new anthem for the team. The new song will be a revised version of his 2010 song 'Shout (for England)' with new lyrics.

Yesterday he said he was dashing to the studios to get the anthem done.

Roy Hodgson asked England’s players to sing the national anthem in unison in one of his first initiatives as national team manager.

The issue had first been raised, Sportsmail understands, by the managing director of Club England, Adrian Bevington.

But it was Hodgson who called his players together last month, ahead of the pre-Euro 2012 friendlies against Norway and Belgium, and told them what he expected of them as English internationals at a major tournament.

Jamie Redknapp, the former England midfielder and Sportsmail columnist, yesterday revealed it is the first time he can remember the whole team singing the Anthem.

Hodgson made the point that the country was celebrating Her Majesty The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee but he also wanted to see that display of unity on the pitch before matches here in Eastern Europe. As millions of television viewers at home have seen, all the players have adhered to Hodgson’s wishes.

'We've got to get my car and get to 
south London to record the England song. We're remixing it to make it 
sound like we're gonna win this time. I was working on the lyrics on the
traffic on my way here,' he told the Independent.

In Stalybridge, Manchester, England fan Dave Tate, 40, and his sons Josh, 16, and Alex, 15, painted a giant cross of St George on the side of their property.

The house now proudly declares ‘We Still Believe’. Web designer Dave said: 'We’re patriotic and I sit and pray England will win a major tournament in my lifetime so we just wanted to show our support for Roy and the boys at Euro 2012.'

Today fans were jetting out to Kiev, Ukraine, as they made a last-minute decision to go to the quarter-final clash.

Chris, the England fan who has been dumped by his partner, is believed to be one of the fans who has flown to the game.

James Sporren, 30, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, who drove under the banner said he had sympathy with the man in question.

He said: 'He’s just enjoying a chance to support his country in a major tournament - and that doesn’t come along very often.

'You
shouldn’t make a man pick between his woman and his country. They will 
have an anniversary every year - this is our best chance for a long 
time.'

But
fellow England fan Bob Sparling, a lorry driver from Birmingham, 
disagreed and said: 'Football is not the be all and end all - you need 
to make sure the lady in your life is kept on the right side.

'I 
wonder if it’s directed at him while he was on his way to Birmingham 
Airport or whether she’s just trying to name and shame him.

'But one thing is for sure - he’ll have hell to pay when he gets home.'
