They are the Champions League holders, the European Super Cup holders and the Spanish Cup holders and Real Madrid can add another trophy to their growing haul if they lift the Club World Cup on December 20.

Carlo Ancelotti's team arrived in Morocco on Sunday and play their semi-final on Tuesday.

Here's our guide to the trophy only one English team has been able to win.

Where is the tournament being held?

In the Moroccan cities of Rabbat, and Marrakech. This is the second consecutive year Morocco has staged the tournament. Japan will host the next two versions of the competition.

Any chance of a host victory?

No. Atletico Tetuan were knocked out by Auckland City on day one. But the locals don't mind too much. They will all support Real Madrid now. James Rodriguez and, above all, Cristiano Ronaldo are the local favourites.

And on a run of 20 straight victories, are Madrid are the overwhelming favourites?

The pitches and their own injury problems may end up being their biggest obstacles. They sent their Galatico groundsman Paul Burgess to look over the pitch at Rabat but the game on Tuesday - against Cruz Azul, from Mexico - has already been moved to Marrakech after heavy rain left the surface in a 'farcical' condition.

Because they are already without Luka Modric (thigh) until March and Rodriguez with a less serious calf injury the last thing they need is another man down.

Apart from local support, will Madrid have Spanish backing?

There are around 8,000 Spaniards in Morocco and some will travel for the tournament from Spain. Packages cost around £950 for the whole tournament and £300 to fly in and see just the final and then fly out again.

Will Madrid definitely reach the final?

They will have to beat Cruz Azul, who won the CONCACAF Cup against Toluca FC but have failed to reach the play-offs contested by the top eight teams in Mexico this season.

And if Real do reach the final, who will they face?

The Pope's team – San Lorenzo. They beat Paraguay's Nacional in the Copa de Libertadores to win the tournament for the first time in their 106-year history and end a five-year run of Brazilian domination. 

If they beat  Auckland City in the semi-final they will stand between Madrid and their first Club World Cup.

Have Madrid ever won it before?

Well yes and no. They won the tournament's predecessor - the Intercontinental - three times in 1960, 1998 and 2002.

How have English teams fared?

Badly. Manchester United won the old Intercontinental in 1999 and the Club World Cup in 2008 but no other English team has won either tournament since it began in 1960. 

Liverpool (twice), Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest were all runners-up in the early Eighties. And Liverpool again in 2005 and Chelsea in 2012 were also beaten finalists.

Manchester United won the Club World Cup back in 2008, the only English club to do so

How badly do Madrid want this?

It's one thing calling yourself the best team in the world but if you win the Club World Cup then it's official. 

This is one of five trophies they can win this season. The European Super Cup is in the bag, La Liga, the Spanish Cup and the Champions League could all follow.

And as an added incentive Barcelona won this trophy in 2009 and 2011, so there is ground to be made up on the old enemy.
