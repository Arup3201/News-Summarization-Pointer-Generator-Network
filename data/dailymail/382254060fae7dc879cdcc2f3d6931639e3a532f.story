A central London council has demanded the Romanian government sends its own police to Britain to deal with rough-sleepers from their country who are setting up camp in the capital.

Westminster Council says the problem is costing the taxpayer £500,000 a year with around 60 immigrants currently bedding down in Hyde Park and next to Marble Arch on Park Lane. 

These gangs are being blamed for crime and anti-social behaviour including pickpocketing, cashpoint fraud and street scams.

Trouble: Westminster Council wants Romanian police to come to the UK to deal with camps like this one currently on Park Lane

Claims: The local authority says that two out of three beggars on its streets were found to be Romanian

Life: One member of the camp sits under a tree and washes his feet in a plastic tub earlier this week before the it was broken up today

People living near them say their streets are becoming 'open sewers' and claim they are having to bleach pavements outside their homes and shops because of the dirt.

During the London 2012 Olympics a team of Romanian police came to the UK to tackle the issue and Westminster Council wants them to come back.

Councillor Nickie Allen has written to the Romanian ambassador about the issue and said: 'We, and the local police, are diverting resources every day 
into dealing with this. My concern is the situation is going to get 
worse with the hot weather.

'Until we stop these 
people coming into the country this is not going to go away. It’s like 
mole holes, you can clear them from one place and they pop up in 
another.'

Occupy Park Lane: A group of women are seen smoking and chatting away among the plastic bags and suitcases, wearing thick jackets despite the summer temperature

Plush stay: As guests of the five-star hotels of Park Lane emerged, they were shocked to find the large group camping out on the doorstep

Playing games: Two men play with a dice and some cards as two other women sit and chat behind them

Scrappy: The camps have been described as 'shanty towns' and local residents say they are making their lives a misery

Costly: Westminster says the Romanian police must come to the UK and get to grips with the issue, as well as cover the costs

Belongings: These clothes were left to dry on a tree trunk while other suitcases and cardboard boxes were dumped against a fence

Councillor Allen has also said she would expect the Romanian government to cover the costs of sending ten officers to London, because 200 of 292 beggars caught in Westminster last year were from that country.

She also plans to push the Government to ensure Romanians committing anti-social behaviour are deported and not allowed to return to the UK.

A recent poll found that almost one in ten Romanians planned to head to the UK and from January Britain will open its labour market to its citizens under EU laws.

They can come to the UK for three months but must leave if they are not working, and are not 'self sufficient'.

Morning ritual: A young man rests on a large plastic bag which appears to contains duvets and blankets, packed up after the group's overnight stay

Home: Around 60 Romanian travellers have spent the past two nights sleeping around Park Lane, Marble Arch and Hyde Park

Across the Channel, France is currently considering whether to use laws to remove thousands of Romanian travellers, which could see them end up in the UK.

Last month police and immigration officials moved in to clear a ‘shanty town’ built by migrants in a leafy London suburb.

A
 total of 68 mainly Romanian squatters were found living in huts built 
from waste wood and plastic amid the filth of a tip at a former football
 ground in Hendon.

Just five of those 
at the camp 
were found to have the right to work in the UK.

Last month dozens of Romanian immigrants were evicted from their camp on the former site of Hendon Football Club in North London

Only five were found to have the right to work in the UK and the rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer

The rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer, but only 19 took up the offer.

They were told they would have to 
leave the country within 30 days, but were released on to the street to 
live rough or in shelters, meaning it could cost up to £15,000 for 
police to find each of them, monitor them and eventually remove them.

Migrants have been living at the 
vermin-infested former Hendon FC ground for more than two years despite 
it having no running water, electricity or sanitation.

They scavenged in
 the rubbish for clothes to wear or things they could sell.

Barnet Council sold the site to 
developers for housing last year but legal challenges over the freehold 
had held up the clearance of the site.
