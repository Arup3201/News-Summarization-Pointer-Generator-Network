Britain could see a repeat of the North Sea oil boom after  it was confirmed that vast deposits of gas lie beneath much of the country.

Ministers said ‘today is the day that Britain gets serious about shale’ gas after revealing resources are many times greater than estimated.

The British Geological Survey has estimated there may be more than 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone.

Industry experts claim even if only 10 per cent is recovered – more than all of the gas produced from the North Sea – it will be enough to power Britain for 50 years.

Heat: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said reserves of shale gas were double the size previously thought

The BGS said the best estimate for shale gas deposits in northern England is 1,329trillion cubic feet, although their research suggested the figure could be as high as 2,281.

With a similar study for shale being carried out in the Weald basin, which covers parts of Kent, Sussex and Surrey, it will fuel hopes the UK energy landscape can be transformed like the US, where drilling – or fracking – has driven down prices.

Energy minister Michael Fallon said it would be ‘irresponsible’ to ignore the potential of shale gas. He added: ‘Today is the day that Britain gets serious about shale.

‘It has the potential to contribute to our energy security, increase investment, to create tax revenues, and to generate significant income for local communities.’

Asked whether it would reduce consumers’ bills, Mr Fallon said: ‘It has the potential to be a game-changer for energy security, it’s another source of home-grown, indigenous energy supply, which we certainly need.

‘We don’t know yet whether it could be a game-changer on price to the scale it’s been in the US.

'That’s why it would be pretty irresponsible not to encourage people to . . . have a look.’

Tax breaks and a more streamlined planning process were also announced yesterday in a bid to boost shale exploration.

So far, only one investigative dig has taken place – near  Blackpool in Lancashire – although experts expect up to 50 investigative wells by the end of 2015.

To encourage exploration, the industry has offered ‘community benefits’ to residents willing to allow drilling.

As well as receiving £100,000 for each well, communities will be given 1 per cent of production revenues.

Campaigners say drilling could scar the 
countryside, pollute water supplies, and clog roads with hundreds of 
lorries transporting gas and dirty water.

Protest: Opponents say the process of fracking can trigger earthquakes and shale gas cannot solve Britain's energy problems

Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth said: ‘Shale gas is not the solution to the UK's energy challenges. Its potential has been hugely over-hyped and there's little evidence it will drive down fuel prices.

‘Extracting shale gas will have a significant effect on local communities and our environment - the more that's extracted, the bigger those impacts will be.

‘The North could be at the heart of Britain's green energy and economic transformation, but not by turning it into another 'gaslands'.’
