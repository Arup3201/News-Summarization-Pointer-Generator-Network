The family of a millionaire Polish priest have evicted his lover and three-year-old son from their house, saying she won't get any of his money - despite a DNA test proving the boy is his.

Wieslawa Dargiewicz, 40, had an eight-year-affair with Father Waldemar Irek, 55, who died suddenly of a heart attack without making a will.

Irek, former rector of the Papal Faculty of Theology in Wroclaw, had also amassed a vast fortune that included a Â£600,000 collection of rare religious works including paintings of icons and statues, which he kept at his home in Olawy, Poland.

When he died in August 2012, Wieslawa was told by the priest's niece that neither she nor their young son, Kuba, would get a penny.

Distraught Wieslawa said: 'Waldemar loved me and Kuba and always said that we would be looked after in the event of his death, and that what he had would go to us.

'But then he suddenly died of a heart attack and because he hadn't changed his will, we are being told we are entitled to nothing.'

Wieslawa was urged into having the DNA test after hiring a private detective to help her.

Private investigator Krzysztof Rutkowski found that Irek had also had affairs with a string of other women and even had two other children from another woman.

Wieslawa said: 'I would not have done this if I had known that Waldek, who so often told me that he loved me, had other women.

'It means I lived a cruel lie - and the one who suffered most was my son.'

She
 added that after Kuba was born, she had given Irek an ultimatum: 'I 
told him it was either me and Kuba or the Church. He chose the Church.'

A
 spokesman for the Archdioceses of Wroclaw said: 'The fact that he led a
 double life is painful for us to hear. But when it comes to child 
support for the boy, alimony after death doesnâ€™t exist in law.'

Irek first made his will in 1997, but changed it many times after.

In none of the subsequent wills were Wieslawa or Kuba mentioned.

Wieslawa added: 'This has been a most 
degrading and humiliating experience as, to prove that Kuba is his son, I
 had to have a DNA test and now the whole thing is in the public media.'

According to her family lawyer Andrzej Mekal, the three-year-old is entitled to at least two-thirds of the inheritance.

Mekal said: 'The father lived in luxury and there are paintings and furniture worth thousands.'

'The child of a deceased parent or parents is entitled to a minimum of two-thirds,' he added.
