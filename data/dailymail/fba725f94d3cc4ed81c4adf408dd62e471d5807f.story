China is moving to within two years of deploying submarine-launched nuclear weapons and adding a new leg to its arsenal meaning it could lead to arms-reduction talks, according to a report by a congressionally mandated US commission.

But in the meantime China, who will appoint a new leader on Thursday, remains the ‘most threatening’ power in cyberspace and presents the largest challenge to America’s supply chain integrity, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission said in a draft of its 2012 report to the US Congress.

Beijing is ‘on the cusp of attaining a credible nuclear triad of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and air-dropped nuclear bombs,’ the report said, adding that China was alone among the five original nuclear weapons states to be expanding its nuclear forces. The others are the United States, Russia, Britain and France.

China has had a largely symbolic ballistic missile submarine capability for decades but is only now set to establish a ‘near-continuous at-sea strategic deterrent,’ the draft said

The expansion of its nuclear forces will inevitably increase tensions in South-East Asia, which is already jittery over the strengthening of the Chinese military and its aggressive pursuit of territorial claims.

It also could add to tensions with Washington, which is determined to contain China’s reach into the Pacific.

The move ‘would necessarily affect Indian and Russian perceptions about the potency of their own deterrent capabilities vis-à-vis China,’ the report said.

Threat: China are increasing its nuclear arsenal

China is party to a number of international pacts and regimes regarding nuclear weapons and materials, including the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. But it remains outside key arms limitation and control conventions, such as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed in April 2010 and the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

The report said that Congress should require the US State Department to spell out efforts to integrate China into existing and future nuclear arms reduction, limitation, and control discussions and agreements.

Congress should also ‘treat with caution’ any proposal unilaterally to reduce operational US nuclear forces without clearer information being made available to the public about China’s nuclear stockpile and force posture, it said.

China is estimated to have a total of 240 nuclear warheads weapons, according to the Arms Control Association, a private nonpartisan group in Washington. In contrast, the US has 5,113, including tactical, strategic and nondeployed weapons.

Beijing has already deployed two of as many as five of a new class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine. The JIN-class boat is due to carry the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile with an estimated range of about 4,600 miles (7,400km).

In its annual report on military and security developments involving China this year, the US Defence Department said that the new submarines and the JL-2 missile would give Chinese forces its ‘first credible sea-based nuclear capability’.

Although the JL-2 programme has faced repeated delays, it could reach an initial operating capability within the next two years, said the Pentagon report, which was released in May.

The final version of the report is to be released next Wednesday by the US-China commission, a 12-member bipartisan group set up in 2000 to report to Congress on security implications of US-China trade.
