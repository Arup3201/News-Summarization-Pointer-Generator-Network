After 76 days at sea a Russian canoeist has become the first person to paddle across the Atlantic.

Gabor Rakonczay, of Hungary, set off from Lagos, Portugal on December 21 to begin his solo mission from Europe to the Caribbean.

On Sunday he reached the island of Antigua, having made one brief stop in the Canary Islands for rest and supplies.

A long way from home: Gabor Rakonczay set off in December from Portugal and arrived in Antigua on Sunday

Rakonczay was incommunicado for 50 days of his voyage after his 7.5 metre canoe capsized, damaging his communications equipment.

It had been his only way of keeping in contact with his family, having turned down a satellite tracking system because it was too expensive.

So since the line went dead on February his wife Viktoria could only wait and hope for the best. She had previously rowed the Atlantic with Rakonczay but on this occasion remained behind in Hungary.

‘The supplier raised the price at the last minute and I decided to leave without one because it was not possible to postpone the trip,’ the 30-year-old said from Nelson’s Dockyard in southern Antigua.

‘This trip was the first time I didn’t have a tracking system and the first time I really would have needed one.’

But Viktoria remained convinced sure her husband was alive and well throughout his seven weeks of silence, maintaining her certitude that it would be down to equipment failure and nothing more sombre.

She posted entries daily on their website, speculating about his position in the canoe nicknamed Valiant and what weather conditions he might be facing.

Rakonczay said that in his solitude he often thought about what his loved ones would be going through in his absence.

He added that he felt heartened by the faith and confidence his family had in his abilities during the long and unavoidable silence.

‘I was positively surprised in those at home ... because everyone was certain that if I run into any difficulties, I’ll be able to solve them,’ Rakonczay said. ‘It was a great relief to reach port because it meant completing the journey and because my family could finally know for sure that I was OK.’

In his small vessel Rakonczay was at the mercy of the elements and off the radar for many larger boats.

He lit smoke flares on three separate occasions to signal ships passing nearby, but failed to communicate with them.

‘Some slowed and even changed direction as they likely picked me up on their radars,’ Rakonczay said. ‘But I was often surrounded by waves 4 meters high and the canoe is less than one meter high, so it’s most likely that they simply weren’t able to see me.’

Despite Rakonczay’s technical difficulties he reached his destination 20 days earlier than planned. Since docking, his achievement has been confirmed by the London-based Ocean Rowing Society International, which adjudicates such feats for the Guinness World Records.

Atlantic crossings had previously been made in rowboats and kayaks, but not a canoe, in which a paddle with a single blade is used.

‘We were disappointed he had no satellite tracking on board,’ said Tatiana Rezva-Crutchlow, editor-in-chief of the society’s website. ‘We are very pleased to hear that he has arrived.’

 ‘I was very interested in discovering what it’s like to be all alone on a ship in the ocean,’ Rakonczay said. ‘It was my childhood dream.’
