Died: Thomas Ross died while on a golfing holiday in Spain

A British golfer drowned in a Spanish lake after he fell in trying to find a lost ball.

Thomas Ross, 73, who could not swim, slipped and tumbled into the water as he played the fifth hole at Dunas de Donana golf course in Almonte, Huelva, Andalucia, at midday on Sunday.

He was pulled out of the lake but died shortly afterwards.

Local media suggest the pensioner could have suffered a fatal heart attack as the water was 'not deep'.

His body was taken to the Forensic Anatomical Institute in Huelva and an autopsy was expected to take place today.

The 18-hole course - which boasts a 
driving range, putting green and tennis school - is located near 
Matalascanas beach, which is popular with British tourists.

Local news site HuelvaYa reports that
 Mr Ross had been staying with a group of friends at the nearby 
four-star Carabela Beach & Golf Hotel.

Police sources believe he was from Scotland and was in Spain on holiday.

Andalucia and are offering consular advice to their family.'

Representatives from both the 291-room hotel and the golf course have declined to comment on the death.
