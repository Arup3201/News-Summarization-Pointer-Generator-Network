Andy Murray has confirmed he will bid for a fourth Queen's Club title this summer at the AEGON Championships in London.

The British No 1 has won the event three times in the last six years and another victory on the grass courts of west London this summer would bring him level with John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick as four-time champions.

Murray said: 'I’d love to win the tournament again. I’ve had some great moments on those grass courts. It's where I won my first professional match and my first title in Britain.

'When you see the names on the trophy, it shows how difficult it is to win. The year I won Wimbledon, it came a few weeks after winning at Queen’s, and it’s perfect preparation.'

Murray is currently training in Melbourne ahead of the Australian Open, which begins next Monday, and took to the Rod Laver Arena court for the first time this year on Monday for a practice session with coach Amelie Mauresmo.

Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov will also return to defend his title at Queen's this summer after beating Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in a thrilling three-set final last year.

Dimitrov said: 'I have always had a special relationship with everyone at the AEGON Championships, right from when I was given two wild cards early on in my career, to last year when I lifted the trophy for the first time.

'It is one of my favourite tournaments and winning the title last year was one of the best moments of my career so far. I am really happy that I will be coming back to defend my title and I look forward to playing in front of the great British crowds again.'

The tournament takes place from June 15-21, which is a week later than its usual slot in the calendar due to the extended grass-court season.
