He seems an unlikely influence for the Royal Family. But judging by their hats, the Queen and the Countess of Wessex may have taken some fashion tips from Boy George.

Both women attended a church service at Sandringham yesterday in headwear that had more than an echo of the Culture Club singer’s extravagant look.

The Queen wore a hat which matched her 
pink dress coat, while Sophie opted for a less colourful but more 
dramatic and oversized creation.

Striking look: Sophie, left, and the Queen, centre, appeared to be sporting hats which could have been inspired by Culture Club lead singer Boy George, right

The pair were driven to church in a Bentley while Prince Philip, 91, walked from Sandringham House.

The Countess was wrapped up warm against the elements in the angled fawn hat and near-matching overcoat, as she accompanied a small contingent of the Royal Family to the service.

The Queen, wearing a pink dress coat, had recovered from a cold last week to be present.

The Royals were greeted before the service at 
St Mary Magdalene Church by around 200 well-wishers.

There
had been rumours that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would make an 
appearance after spending Christmas Day with Kate’s family in 
Bucklebury, Berkshire.

Cheerful: Sophie Countess of Wessex smiled as she was pictured sat alongside the Queen as the pair attended mass at St Mary Magdelene Church in the grounds of Sandringham this morning

Heading home: The Queen and Countess looked happy as they left St Mary Magdelene Church on the Sandringham Estate following Sunday service

But
it is understood the couple paid a brief visit to the Queen’s Norfolk 
residence this week, during which they attended a shoot on the estate, 
but left before today’s church service.

Earlier
this month, it was announced that William and Kate are expecting their 
first child, after the duchess was admitted to hospital with an acute 
bout of morning sickness.

Since then they have attended minimal public 
engagements.

Members of the crowd expressed disappointment at William and Kate’s absence.

The
Duke of Edinburgh, who was forced to miss the service last year 
because of a heart problem, made his way to church on foot.

Greeting: Around 200 well-wishers turned out at St Mary Magdelene Church, Sandringham, as the Queen, Countess of Wessex and Prince Philip attended church

Happy and glorious: The Queen, left, looked to be over last week's cold as she attended church dressed in a pink and black-trimmed coat and matching hat this morning, while Sophie Wessex looked delighted as she mingled with some of the well-wishers who had turned out to greet them at Sandringham

Prince
Harry has been absent from the Royals’ Christmas celebrations, as he is
serving as an Apache helicopter pilot with the Army Air Corps in 
Afghanistan.

More than 1,000 people watched Prince Philip walked the 300 metres from Sandringham House with Prince Edward.

Members of the crowd expressed disappointment at William and Kate’s absence and many went home before the end of the 40 minute service.

Royal salute: Prince Edward is saluted outside church at Sandringham as he arrives for Sunday mass this morning

Sunday stroll: Prince Philip, who was too ill to attend last year's service due to a heart problem, walked to church at Sandringham this morning

Sophie Wessex cheerfully points at a young girl who holds a policewoman's hand at Sandringham estate this morning. She took time to mingle with well-wishers after arriving at church with the Queen

The couple attended church
in Berkshire on Christmas Day, but newspapers were asked not to publish
pictures due to privacy concerns

After yesterday’s service a beaming Queen collected flowers from several children before being driven back to Sandringham House.

One
said: ‘It is such a shame that Kate and William are not here. It would 
have been great to see them supporting the Queen and Prince Philip.’
