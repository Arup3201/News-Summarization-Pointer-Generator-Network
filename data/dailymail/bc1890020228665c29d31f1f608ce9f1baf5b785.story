Michael Douglas fully supports Catherine Zeta-Jones' decision to seek treatment for her bipolar II disorder again.

The 68-year-old Behind the Candelabra star is fully devoted to his Welsh actress wife of twelve years, who is expected to complete a 30-day programme as a 'proactive' measure to help with her condition, which can cause high and low mood swings as well as depression.

A friend close to the couple told People.com: 'He couldn't be more supportive, just like she is of him.

They're solid. They're really, really devoted to each other.'

Catherine's spokesperson Cece Yorke earlier confirmed to People: 'Catherine has proactively checked into a health care facility.

'Previously Catherine has said that she is committed to periodic care in order to manage her health in an optimum manner.'

Happy and healthy: Catherine Zeta Jones was last seen at the 40th Chaplin Awards Gala Honoring Barbara Streisand in New York on April 22 with her husband Michael Douglas - she checked into a treatment centre for bipolar on Monday

A source tells the publication that 
Zeta-Jones was planning to return to treatment as a way for doctors to 
monitor her medication.

'There
was no big problem,' insisted the insider. 'This was just a good time 
to do it. She is in between projects. This has always been part of the 
plan. She would manage her health. She is vigilant about it.'

Another source also told TMZ she has not had a relapse, adding: 'It's maintenance.'

Jones first sought help in 2011, at 
the time her spokesperson said that Catherine had 'made the decision to 
check in to a mental health facility for a brief stay to treat her 
Bipolar II disorder.'

Catherine looked fine on April 22nd 
when she attended the 40th Anniversary Chaplin Award Gala at Lincoln 
Center with her husband Michael Douglas, who attended the White House 
Correspondents' Dinner in Washington without her - an unusual 
occurrence.

In 2011 she stayed for five days, 
joining 10 to 15 others in the £770-a-day detox centre at the hospital 
in New Canaan, Connecticut.

Her publicist confirmed that she had received mental health treatment to help her cope with her traumatic personal life.

‘After dealing with the stress of the past year, Catherine made the 
decision to check into a mental health facility for a brief stay to 
treat her bipolar II disorder,’ she said.

‘She’s feeling great and looking forward to starting work this week on two upcoming films.’

New York Mental Health Consultant Stefanie Weiss, who has not treated the actress, believes that the decision to return to a treatment centre would have been especially difficult, given her high-profile identity.

'Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness that is not easy for anyone to live with, especially when the Hollywood spotlight is constantly on you,' she told MailOnline.

'Catherine Zeta Jones going back into treatment for a disorder that she struggles with is an extremely difficult and private decision. It is unfortunate that she needs the added stress of reporting to the media and her many fans that she needs to take this time to improve her mental health.

'Hopefully, her courageous decision to seek help will inspire more people to do the same.'

Facility: The actress spent five days at the Silver Hill Hospital near New Canaan, Connecticut

Douglas, with whom she has two young children, battled stage four throat cancer in 2010, enduring both chemotherapy and 
radiation.

Catherine showed signs that she was struggling to cope with her emotions when she broke down in public that September at the Ryder Cup Welcome To Wales concert at Cardiff Millennium Stadium.

Catherine had been booked months before her husband fell ill to speak at the event and had to go to the event solo as he was treated back in New York.

A traumatic event can sometimes cause symptoms of the mood-altering illness.

Experts
say patients experience both elevated moods - which may lead to bouts 
of increased activity - as well as episodes of depression.

Unlike bipolar I, the 'up' moods do not  reach full-on levels of mania.

Rather
than descending into deep depressions, patients can be very outgoing, 
functional and often more productive than normal, one reason why it 
often goes undiagnosed.

People
in a hypomanic state also often have a decreased need for sleep. They 
are also said to be at a higher risk of committing suicide.

Celebrities who have reportedly battled various forms of bipolar 
disorder have included Britney Spears, Stephen Fry and Charlie Sheen.

It is treatable with medication.

Dr Michael Roizen, America’s first Chief Wellness Officer, claims genetics can also be a factor.

‘If one or more of your parents has the mood disorder, you are more likely to develop bipolar disorder.

‘Other
contributing factors include stress, illness, death, or a job loss. 
Also, researchers believe that bipolar disorder may be caused in part by
an imbalance in any or all of the brain chemicals norepinephrine, 
serotonin, and dopamine.’

‘Sometimes
a traumatic event that causes a lot of stress can cause bipolar II 
disorder to develop. Other possible causes include an abnormal amount of
hormones and drug use,’ added a spokeswoman for the US Honour Society 
of Nursing.

But the strain was too much for her and she broke down when talking about him in her native Wales in front of the 13,000 strong audience.

The 68-year-old 
announced in January 2011 that doctors had declared him free of cancer 
following six months of gruelling treatment.

The actor accompanied his ‘emotionally distraught’ wife as she 
checked into the hospital under the name Terrie Kirny, the National 
Enquirer magazine claimed.

A witness at the hospital told the magazine that the Welsh-born 
actress, who was made a CBE in February, appeared ‘happy’ during her 
stay.

She apparently joined fellow guests for meals, jogs around the grounds and even poker sessions before bed.

Miss Zeta-Jones often appeared to be on edge in public during Douglas’s treatment for throat cancer.

She was close to tears at New York’s John F Kennedy airport after 
she reportedly cut short a visit to the UK when her husband’s 
conditioned worsened.

In February, she flew into a rage at a photographer in London, 
claiming he hit her as she and Douglas returned to their hotel after 
dinner.

The Enquirer also quoted an observer who said she had ‘really put the
red wine away’ during two recent visits with Douglas to a Manhattan 
restaurant.

Miss Zeta-Jones claimed in 2004 that a stalker’s threats against her 
left her so shaken that she feared she would have a nervous breakdown.

The Enquirer quotes a family source as saying: ‘It’s been the most 
difficult year of her life. She’s been through hell! The pressure has 
been almost unbearable.’

Claiming that the actress had suffered ‘more sleepless nights than 
you could possibly know’ worrying about her husband, the source added: 
‘Catherine had a lot of trouble coping. She was chain-smoking and 
drinking.

‘It was tearing Catherine apart to see such a vital man as Michael in such a weakened state. I think she was crumbling.’

Zeta-Jones said as much in an interview last September in which 
she spoke of the pain of watching her husband dealing with cancer and 
her ‘fury’ that doctors did not spot it earlier.

The couple’s stress levels will not have been helped by moves this 
week by Douglas’s first wife, Diandra, to revive her court battle for a 
share of  his Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps earnings.

Her camp pressed a judge to reconsider his view that the 
case belongs in California. The couple divorced there in 2000 after 23 
years together.

His lawyer said her client's ex 'should be ashamed of herself' for 
seeking more when she had already received more than $51 million in 
their divorce settlement.

Douglas' adult son Cameron, from his marriage to Diandra, was sentenced to prison last year on drug charges.

Zeta-Jones and Douglas are parents to son Dylan, 10, and daughter Carys, who turns eight on April 20.

The
actress' upcoming film projects include Playing the Field, a comedy 
starring Gerard Butler, Dennis Quaid Jessica Biel, and Dali, a biopic 
with Antonio Banderas.
