Much-loved: Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry as the popular PG Wodehouse characters Wooster and Jeeves

Sebastian Faulks is to breathe new life into the much-loved characters Jeeves and Wooster after being approached by the estate of PG Wodehouse.

The writer, whose acclaimed works include Birdsong and A Week In December, has had a lengthy love of the duo after first reading a story at the age of 12.

Jeeves And The Wedding Bells is to be published in November by Hutchinson, which issued all of Wodehouse’s later novels.

Faulks, 59, gave his own take on another established character when he was asked to write a James Bond novel, Devil May Care.

Wodehouse, who died in 1975 aged 93, has been loved by generations and is seen as one of the great humorists of the 20th century.

He wrote more than 90 novels and 300 short stories during a literary career spanning more than 70 years.

He also worked on plays and musicals such as Anything Goes.

Publishers of the new book said it will be ‘faithful to the history and personality of Wodehouse’s characters but by shining a different light on them will also show how robust, durable and lovable these creations are’.

The characters of Jeeves and Wooster – a butler and his foppish, upper-crust employer – were brought to life in the early 1990s for a television series by Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie.

'New life': Acclaimed author Sebastian Faulks has been a fan of the characters since he was 12 years old

Faulks said: ‘I hope my story will ring bells with aficionados but also bring new readers to these wonderful books.’
