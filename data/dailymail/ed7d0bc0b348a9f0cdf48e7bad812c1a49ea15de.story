Worringly, in the recent past, Scottish football enforced an unofficial entry restriction based solely on height.

When assessing the impact made by the likes of Andres Iniesta and Xavi for both Barcelona and Spain some years ago, Billy Stark, the current manager of the Scotland under 21s, stated there was every chance that the pair would not have made in it in the Scottish game simply because – at 5ft 7in - neither provided a threat at set pieces.

If Stark’s words were a depressing commentary on how prehistoric the Scottish game had become, then we should be thankful that the vast majority of clubs had already long since heeded them and mended their ways.

By the time Spain and Barca were 
beginning their domination of international and club football, Dundee 
United were one of those who recognised that size was far from 
everything.

In Ryan Gauld, a former Brechin Boys Club player who came into the Tannadice youth set up in 2006, the Tayside club immediately saw they had a player small in stature but with enormous ability.

Brought under the wing of United’s progressive youth supremo Ian Cathro, Gauld’s natural talent was such that he was invariably asked to demonstrate training drills to the assembled hopefuls. There and then, the moniker Mini Messi was his to keep.

Long before Peter Houston handed him his debut as a 16-year-old against Motherwell in the final match of season 2011-12, the jungle drums were beating about the 5ft 6in sensation.

By the time the following campaign was underway, it was clear for all to see that all the hype was not unjustified. 

Costly: Gauld has an incredible £48million release clause in his Sporting Lisbon contract

Promise: Sporting Lisbon signed talented teenager Gauld from Dundee United on a six-year contract

It wasn’t so much Gauld’s ability to ghost away from players at will that caught the eye. Nor was it just his mesmerising ball control. What really stood out was his impeccable decision making in the final third.

Time and again, he executed exactly the right pass with exactly the right pace at exactly the right moment. Game intelligence far beyond his tender years. Defenders eliminated left, right and centre.

As befits any teenager, there have inevitably been humps in the road over the course of the past couple of seasons. Gauld was virtually unplayable last winter but a sudden loss in form prompted Jackie McNamara, his manager, to send him and team-mate John Souttar off to a sunshine break in Spain. It helped immeasurably.

Despite his tender years, Gauld is a player who has always known his own mind. Upon picking up a player of the month award last season, he was inevitably asked about his future intentions.

The answer was interesting: Not the predictable move to the Premiership or the Championship but perhaps Spain: Somewhere where he’d get time to play. Sporting Lisbon were clearly hanging on his every word.

Wise: Gauld makes excellent decisions on the pitch as much as anything else in his game

In many ways he’s a throwback to the halcyon days of Scottish football when the likes of Jimmy Johnstone tortured hulking defenders.

Earlier this year there was a heart-warming tale of a man walking through a Dundee park on afternoon and spotting a handful of kids having a kickabout. They were good. Darned good, in fact.

At closer inspection the group revealed themselves to be none other than Gauld and friends enjoying a game on their day off.

In the blink of an eye, the one dubbed Mini Messi is a £3m Sporting Lisbon player with a £48m release clause.

Thank heavens that height restriction was thrown in the bin.
