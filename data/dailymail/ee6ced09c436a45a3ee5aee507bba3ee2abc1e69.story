New York, eat your heart out. 

It may come as a surprise to some locals, but a new Deutsche Bank study has found that housing in Wollongong is more expensive than in the Big Apple.

The sprawling New South Wales beachside town with a population around 300,000 has joined the ranks of Sydney, Melbourne and London in having pricier homes than America's biggest city. 

The study of global house prices, spearheaded by Deutsche Bank chief economist Peter Hooper, found homes in those cities were more expensive than those Toronto, Washington D.C and Miami.

And in a fact Business Spectator said 'should really terrify (home)owners and policymakers alike', the survey reported that Australian homes are overvalued by a whopping 49 per cent.

The stark report comes amid mixed forecasts about the immediate future of the property market - and no doubt, eyes popping at Wollongong's place in the survey. 

While many associate Wollongong with affordable family homes and small brick units by the beach, the town does have its fair share of luxury properties, according to agents. 

A local agency, MMJ Real Estate, is selling a $3.9 million property in Mount Kembla, just half an hour out of town.

227 Cordeaux road offers six bedrooms, a six car garage, horse stables, a resort style pool, a studio and all just a short hop from the beach

What do you get for that much money? Six bedrooms, a six car garage, horse stables, a resort style pool, a studio and 'absolute privacy' just a short hop from the beach, said MMJ sales director David Geary.

'You name it, (the owner's) got it,' Mr Geary told Daily Mail Australia, who then reflected on the appeal of the southern city, home to a university and a hospital. 

'You've got a beautiful waterline district escarpment on one side, and beautiful ocean beaches on the other,' Mr Geary said. 

'Nothing's more than 10 minutes away from the beach. It's a real seaside place where people would love to retire as well.'

'It's a good quality life, just an hour from the airport up there in Sydney,' he said.

The median house price in the city's CBD is $619,500, according to RealEstate.com.au, while in West Wollongong the median price sits just short of $500,000.

The market in the region is still 'really strong', Belle Property real estate agent Nicole Kay told Daily Mail Australia - even in spite of lingering sluggishness from the Christmas period.  

'There's certainly a lot of investors coming out of the area, investors locally, (looking for) close-to-the-beach apartments.

'There's a lot of movement in the local community - (looking for) more established homes down towards the beaches and beachside apartments.'

Ms Kay said her agency had a 'gorgeous top floor penthouse apartment with outstanding views' in the Wollongong CBD going to auction next week. The expected price will be around $1.3 million. 

Another 'beautiful acreage property' down in Tongarra coming on the market in a few weeks even has its own waterfall, she said.  

But she did express some surprise that Wollongong prices had topped several of the world's most recognisable cities. 

'I think that would surprise anybody, wouldn't it really?' she said. 'But we've got a lot to offer - a good lifestyle, lots of natural beauty.' 

And now, it seems, a global property reputation.
