Under-strain A&E units have missed the target to see patients within four hours for the first time this winter.

In further sign of a growing crisis in emergency departments, the NHS in England failed to ensure that 95 per cent cases were dealt with within the time limit.

Health bosses said they had always known this winter ‘would be difficult’ but critics said that it could be a sign of worse to come.

Pressure: A&E departments missed the four-hour waiting time target for the first time since April

Official NHS figures show how the 95 per cent target has been missed for the first time in 2013-14

It is the first time that the four-hour waiting time target has not been met since April and comes amid warnings that expected winter pressures are only just starting to bite.

Last week, 94.8 per cent of NHS patients in England were treated within the target time of four hours set for emergency departments, including minor injuries units and urgent care centres.

Waiting times were worst in major A&E wards where just 92.2 per cent of patients were seen within four hours.

Across England, 3,678 patients were forced to wait between four and 12 hours for treatment.

And five patients were not seen for more than 12 hours, the figures show.

Last week, hospitals treated more than 415,000 patients in A&E - 3,500 patients more than the previous week.

NHS England boss Dame Barbara Hakin said the health service always knew this winter would be difficult

Dame Barbara Hakin, chief operating officer for NHS England, said: ‘It is of course disappointing that any patient has to wait longer than they should in A&E; however, we are now seeing many more patients than ever before.

‘Last week was the busiest so far this year, with 415,400 attendances and 105,800 emergency admissions - the highest number of emergency admissions since we started collecting data in November 2010.

‘We know the A&E standard is ambitious and that is only right. This is the first week since April the 95 per cent standard has not been met; however, we do know that sometimes this will happen. Every year we see a dip in the figures for December, with week-on-week variations, which is why we fully assess how local systems are coping with winter pressures over a longer period.

‘We knew this winter would be difficult but it is important to stress the NHS continues to deliver a good service, with 94.8 per cent of people going to hospital for urgent care this week treated, admitted or discharged within four hours. This is thanks to the hard work and dedication of our frontline staff.’

It comes after it emerged patients are having to wait longer than six hours in ambulances parked outside A&E departments.

Labour;s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'Patients are waiting hours on end to be seen in England's A&E. And yet David Cameron and his ministers deny that A&E is in crisis.

'This dangerous complacency can't go on. 2013 has been the worst year in a decade in A&E and David Cameron's fingerprints are all over it. It is yet more proof that you cannot trust the Tories with the NHS.'

Last
week alone nearly 4,500 patients were kept in the vehicles for at 
least half an hour because staff were too busy to look after them.

Figures
obtained by BBC News under the Freedom of Information Act covered the 
three months until the end of October, and revealed that a patient in 
Wales was forced to wait six hours and 22 minutes, while another in East
England was held for five hours and 51 minutes.

Senior doctors and nurses said waits in most recent weeks could have been even longer.

The
figures will add to concerns that casualty departments are struggling 
to cope with the rising numbers of patients expected this winter.
