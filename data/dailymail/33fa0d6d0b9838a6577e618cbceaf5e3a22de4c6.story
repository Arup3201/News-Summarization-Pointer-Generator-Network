Smokers in America will burn up as much as $2 million in a lifetime thanks to the habit, a study has found.

The study, from finance site WalletHub, found that lifelong smokers in the states where cigarettes cost the most are hit hardest.

Feeling the pinch the worst are smokers in Alaska, Connecticut and New York where the cost over 50 years hovers around $2 million.

Costly: A recent study puts the cost of smoking over a lifetime near $2 million for some Americans

Even in the states where cigarettes cost the least, bulk of the cost came from the cigarettes themselves.

In South Carolina, where a pack of smokes costs around $5, the typical smoker can expect their habit to cost them $786,346 in cigarettes and missed investment opportunities.

In Alaska, where a pack of cigarettes costs double what it does in much of the South, WalletHub puts the lifetime cost at just over $1.5 million.

To reach its upper end lifetime cost estimate, WalletHub added to the cigarette cost/lost investments: health care costs, income loss as well as other costs like higher insurance premiums or denied insurance claims.

Rounding the top five most expensive states to be a smoker are Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

The cheapest places to puff away after South Carolina were West Virginia followed by Kentucky, Mississippi and Georgia.
