A cardiologist has been found to have prescribed and administered morphine to a teenage colleague that he was dating.

Dr Paul Langton, who became a registered practitioner in 1990, had formed an intimate relationship with an 18-year-old woman who worked at his hospital after she came to him for treatment in late 2010.

The Medical Board of Australia condemned his treatment as inappropriate due to the woman's 'history of illicit drug use', fining him $30,000 and suspending him from practice for 18 months. 

Dr Paul Langton, a cardiologist at Hollywood Private Hospital in Perth, will be suspended from practice for 18 months and has been fined $30,000

Based in Perth at Hollywood Private Hospital, Dr Langton treated and advised the woman from late 2010 until mid 2011.

This included injecting her with morphine and writing prescriptions for injectable ampoules of morphine sulphate as a treatment for her chronic low back pain.

The Medical Board of Australia wrote that the doctor's first recommendations should have been 'mild analgesia, appropriate exercise and referral to a physiotherapist'.

It  found that the administration of morphine was entirely inappropriate due to the woman's 'history of illicit drug use, binge drinking and anxiety and depression increased the risk of addiction and inappropriate use of morphine'.

However, the board's overall ruling stated that the duo's intimate relationship, 'compromised [Mr Langton's] ability to provide proper medical advice and treatment' to the woman.

The board also heard Dr Langton was suffering from depression during his relationship with the teen and ruled that this played a 'significant part in him making the errors of judgment he did in advising and treating her'.

He was found to have been treating an 18-year-old colleague that he had formed an intimate relationship with. This included prescribing and administering her with morphine despite her history of illicit drug use 

It was also revealed that he had taken sedatives from his work place, including Propofol, Midazolam and Fentanyl, to help him sleep. 

Dr Langton told the ABC that he had reported himself to the board, which stated that he 'admits that he behaved in a way that constitutes professional misconduct'.

He was fined $30,000 and will be suspended from practice for 18 months as of November 21.

The board's ruling also requires him to undergo assessment by a psychiatrist every four months and a psychologist every three months.
