'Humiliated': Jane Hampson (pictured) had to leave the Pi bar in Liverpool out of embarrassment after a bartender refused to serve her a small glass of wine because she was pregnant

A mother-to-be has said she was left 'humiliated' after she was refused a small glass of wine because she is heavily pregnant.

Jane Hampson, 37, said she would usually enjoy one 125ml glass of red wine a week with a meal after reading research which suggested it was medically acceptable.

But the Deutsche Bank worker, who is overdue with her first baby, was left dumbfounded after a barman at Pi bar, in Liverpool, told her: 'Sorry, I can't serve you.'

When she asked him why, the bartender said: 'I refuse to have serving alcohol to pregnant women on my conscience.'

The exchange attracted the attention of other customers at the busy bar as Miss Hampson and her partner Alistair Townend, 37, asked for an explanation.

Miss Hampson said they eventually left the bar out of embarrassment and bought a glass of red wine elsewhere.

The NHS currently advises pregnant women should drink no more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week - the equivalent of a 125ml glass of wine.

As bar bosses today apologised for the snub, Miss Hampson, from Mossley Hill, Liverpool, said: 'I couldn’t believe it - it was so humiliating.

'There is no way I would endanger my unborn baby yet it was being insinuated that I was doing just that and being irresponsible.

'At the time the bar was packed and all the customers were looking over at us to see what all the commotion was about. We felt we had no choice but to leave because it was so embarrassing.

'The fact I am pregnant was none of his business. I appreciate a bar’s management reserve the right not to serve customers but obviously I wasn’t drunk or misbehaving or under 18 - so he had no reason not to serve me.

'I am not some Vicky Pollard-type binge drinker. I have done extensive research on the effects of drinking alcohol when pregnant and the fact is there’s nothing wrong with having a small glass of wine every week.

'I have enjoyed a small glass of red wine with a meal once a week throughout my pregnancy but it’s not been every week.

'I would describe myself as health-conscious. I have run two marathons in the past and I am not into filling my body with anything that shouldn’t be there.

'When you look at how much of an issue excess alcohol causes in this country, I really don’t feel that any establishment that chooses to profit from alcohol sales is in any position to judge anyone.'

The incident occurred after Miss Hampson decided to take a long walk with Mr Townend around Liverpool’s Sefton Park on Tuesday night. After their stroll the couple, who have been together for 10 months, headed to nearby Pi bar.

Miss Hampson, who works as an intermediary business manager for Deutsche Bank and also runs her own website selling eco-friendly soaps and cosmetics, said: 'I asked the barman for a small glass of red wine and as soon as I said it I could see him pursing his lips as if taking a sharp intake of breath.

'I went to the toilet leaving Alistair at the bar and when I came back the barman came up to me and said he wouldn’t serve me because he couldn’t have serving a pregnant woman alcohol on his conscience. It was outrageous and embarrassing.

'We asked why but he wouldn’t budge. We went to another bar nearby and I drank a glass of wine there instead.'

She added: 'Throughout my pregnancy I have taken good care of myself and made the best choices for my baby. I eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and make a fresh carrot, ginger and apple juice every morning.

'I don’t even use normal deodorant because I am concerned about using environmentally friendly and ethical products.

'I have read numerous articles about the effects of drinking alcohol when pregnant and I believe one small glass of wine once a week is not harmful to me or my baby.

'I had no alcohol during first 12 weeks of pregnancy apart from one glass of bubbly and one wine in that 12 week period and then, at most one glass a week, but not every week.

'It was usually with a nice meal out or on the odd occasion, like that Tuesday just after as long-a-walk as I could manage. The barman who refused to serve me was only in his 20s. It’s not up to him to decide what I should and shouldn’t be putting in my body.

According to NHS guidelines, too much exposure to alcohol can seriously affect an unborn baby's development.

Pregnant women are therefore advised to avoid drinking alcohol if pregnant or trying to get pregnant.

For those who do choose to drink, the NHS advises not to drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) advises pregnant women should avoid alcohol in the first three months in particular.

Women who drink heavily during pregnancy risk their baby developing foetal alcohol syndrome. Children with this syndrome have restricted growth, facial abnormalities and learning and behavioural disorders.

'I felt like asking whether he refuses to serve fat people pies, or whether the bar checks how much caffeine a woman has consumed that day before they serve her a cup of coffee.

'There is recent research that suggests baldness is linked to alcohol consumption, are they going to start measuring people’s hairlines before they serve them a pint?'

Ben Reynolds, area manager of Pi Bar, described the incident as an 'unfortunate misunderstanding'.

He said: 'I would first and foremost like to apologise to Ms Hampson for any upset or embarrassment caused.

'I can fully understand her grievances and can completely understand why she felt upset.

'I would like to state that we have no company policy on the serving or not serving of alcohol to pregnant people. Why would we? It’s none of our business.

'What occurred was simply the result of a junior member of staff making a mistake and getting his wires crossed.

'He is deeply sorry for upsetting Ms Hampson and assures me that he was not, as I fear she believes, making a judgment on her, but rather thought for some reason, despite his training, that licensing laws forbade the serving of alcohol to pregnant people.

'However I can understand, given the unfortunate way he appears to have said it, why Ms Hampson felt he was insinuating otherwise. I would very much like to get in contact with Ms Hampson to apologise directly.'
