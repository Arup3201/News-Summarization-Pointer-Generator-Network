The unassuming man who, over the years, drove hundreds of children in the school buses of south Nottinghamshire was a war hero - not that any of them knew that. Alec Gilbert was not the sort of man to boast. His generation didn’t.

They had seen and done much but they kept quiet about it, even with their own families. So it was only after he died that, among his personal effects, Mr Gilbert’s sons found proof of his outstanding bravery in northern France in June 1940.

The Dunkirk beaches had been evacuated in the spectacular small-boat rescue of the British Army much hailed by Winston Churchill, but many thousands of soldiers who had not made it to the beaches remained in France, trying to hold off the rapidly advancing Germans until they could find another way home.

Corporal Gilbert of the Signals Corp was one of those men. With bombs from German planes and shells from enemy artillery exploding all around him, he drove a lorry to pick up fuel for five stranded British tanks.

It was a mission impossible, on roads crowded with refugees and riddled with craters, but, grimly sticking to his task, he made it - an act of ‘outstanding courage, initiative and devotion to duty’, according to the citation for bravery which was unearthed on his death.

Alec Gilbert was one of millions of ordinary, unsung British soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought their war between 1939 and 1945 with all the courage they could muster and then came home and got on with their lives, somehow burying the horrors they had experienced and quietly moving on.

I know about him because his niece wrote to tell me after she had read an article about another soldier fighting in that same rearguard action in France: Major James Grant, the grandfather of actor Hugh Grant.

It was a letter like scores I have received from families in response to my writings about World War II.

‘Dad’ was in bombers, on an Arctic convoy, at Alamein, D-Day, Arnhem and so on, these missives would tell me, but he would never talk about it.

‘And now he’s dead I will never know’ is often the haunting refrain of those who realise one of the mainstays of their life kept a huge secret from them that it is now too late to unearth.

Derring-do: Mr Stoke, right, is pictured in 1941, when he was a Lance Corporal in the SAS

Peter Stokes does know what his father, Horace, was doing 70 years ago - but when he found out, it was a huge shock.

As this paper reported yesterday, he discovered only on his father’s deathbed that the genial greengrocer and later cheery pub landlord had been a pioneering member of the elite, daredevil SAS.

He parachuted into Nazi territory on secret sabotage missions and escaped from two POW camps.

His extraordinary exploits were detailed in a journal he handed to his son shortly before he died in 1986, which is now being published.

‘I was filled with pride when I read it,’ says Mr Stokes. A military man himself, with distinguished service in the RAF, he was nonetheless ‘awestruck’ by the deeds his father described.

Rising through the ranks: In this picture Mr Stoke, right, is a sergeant in the SAS. He would have killed many people as part of his service, and seen his own comrades die

‘He was involved in some of the most famous raids during the World War II, and yet he’d never mentioned a word of it.

'At the end of the war, he closed the door on what he had done. He had killed many, many people and had seen his best friends killed.

‘But I know there was not a night that passed when he did not sit and reflect on what he had done.’

Secrecy was (and still is) emblematic of the SAS, and that may have been why Stokes Senior waited so long to unburden himself.

For many others, however, their reluctance to talk about the war was because they felt they had wasted their youth in uniform and simply wanted to forget it.

As one veteran told me: ‘When I got home, I didn’t say much about what had happened to me. I didn’t want to burden anyone. All I wanted to do was go out and have fun again.’

He promptly met the girl who would become his wife. ‘We hit it off really well and were married three months later. I didn’t want to tell her about it. It was behind me. We had a new life of our own to lead.’

For many others, their years of silence were because they could not bear to let their minds go back to horrors they had experienced or because they simply thought no one would be interested.

In 1945, when the war ended, there was little appetite to hear someone else’s sob story or even their tale of courage and derring-do.

Those who had fought overseas came home to a country that was rationed, blitzed and on its knees economically.

Pretty soon the struggle to survive the peace outweighed the nostalgic re-living of the glories of the war.

Heroes were two a penny, and treated as even less. Take RAF Sergeant Jimmy ‘Dixie’ Deans, a man of exceptional courage and integrity.

As the leader of thousands of British inmates of a prisoner of war (POW) camp in remote eastern Germany, he had the commanding presence to shepherd his men on the notorious 500-mile Long March to the west, forced on them by their German captors who were fleeing advancing Russian troops.

Record: Horace Stokes left this detailed journal to his son when he was about to die

He somehow found enough food to sustain them in a barren land and, through guts and guile, negotiated them safely past trigger-happy SS troops.

When the column was accidentally strafed by our own side and 60 men were shot to pieces, he cycled and bluffed his way through the German front line, then over no man’s land to the advancing British lines to warn them to be more careful.

And then, because he had given his word to the Germans who still held his men, he went back the way he had come, back into captivity.

Fellow prisoners were in awe of Deans’s daring, but after the war the RAF scandalously had no use for him.

He ended up as an anonymous civilian pen-pusher, afflicted by multiple sclerosis, forgotten by everyone except the hundreds of ex-POWs who turned up for his funeral in 1989.

Men who had been POWs in the war often kept quiet about their experiences, ashamed - for no good reason - about having been captured.

In northern France, Private Jock Graham - unlike Alec Gilbert, who escaped via Cherbourg - surrendered to the Germans at gunpoint, but only after two weeks on the run.

As a POW, ‘Dad’s humour and optimism kept him going through forced marches and work in Polish mines’, according to his daughter, Janette.

Filled with pride: Peter Stokes, himself a military man, was 'awestruck' to read of his father's actions

For decades, he suppressed memories of the awful times he’d had - the crippling work, hunger, brutality - but they surfaced in the end in the saddest of ways, relived horrifically in the dementia of his old age.

As well as the POWs, airmen who had fought in Bomber Command also tended to keep quiet about what they had done, embarrassed by the unwarranted vitriol poured on them for the war they waged on German cities and civilians.

But to have sat cramped inside the narrow and freezing fuselage of a Lancaster for hours on end, bucketed by winds and then battered by flak, shell-shot and shrapnel, was a test of endurance and courage, whatever the merits and morality of the mission you were sent on.

The rear gunner was uniquely exposed, staring out into nothingness, just a thin layer of Perspex between him and 20,000ft of thin air, the original man in a glasshouse waiting for stones to be thrown at him.

There were so many ways to die - a bullet in the face, sucked out if the casing shattered, burnt alive if the plane caught fire, drowned if you crashed into the sea, crushed if you fell on land.

Secure: Many of those who served in the war kept their experiences hidden, either in a diary like this, which belonged to Mr Stokes, or in their own memories, to be lost forever

And the men who fought in aircraft knew that intimately. They watched planes alongside them in the formation - with mates on board - flame, droop and plunge to destruction.

They could only pray, as they all did, they wouldn’t be next. If you were hit, you knew the chances of survival were small.

The death rate for Bomber Command crew was a chilling 50 per cent. And yet they went out night after night, fearing the worst, suppressing the fear.

Such men kept their thoughts to themselves. They did not ‘tweet’ their feelings to all and sundry - despite their emotions and experiences being of a profundity that shames the trivia of so much of today’s instant communication.

They did not shout the odds about what they had done because tomorrow they might well be dead - as their best friend probably already was - or at best maimed and scarred for life.

And after it was all over, they kept quiet because they were just thankful to be alive.

‘When I look back,’ one veteran airman told me, ‘I remember saying that if I ever got through the war alive, I would enjoy every day of my life. I’ve done a pretty good job of that.

‘I never thought of myself as a hero. A survivor, yes, not a hero. And lucky, damn lucky.’

This was a generation that went to the edge and looked over.  Those who came back were humbled by the experience - and, in this vainglorious, look-at-me  21st-century society of ours, that demands respect.

Respect for their courage but also respect for their humility.
