The night shift was under way at our police station in South-West London when a 999 call came through.

I was an inspector in those days, and felt a frisson of excitement as I received the report of a burglary at a nearby detached home. 

This was what I really loved about my job: chasing and nicking criminals. It was why I’d joined the police.

'Proper copper': Dai Davies says punches and kicks were all part of the job

Immediately, I left the station with  several officers and we raced to the house whose owner had reported the break-in. The burglar was said to be lurking somewhere in the garden. 

Without hesitation and despite my short stature, I decided to climb over a high wall to catch the thief.

As I leapt up and put my hands on top of the wall  to pull myself over it, I felt a sharp, stabbing pain.

The surface had been covered in broken glass, precisely to deter any attempted intrusion.

I could feel the thick, warm blood streaming down my outstretched arms. But there was no turning back. Even with these serious cuts, I hauled myself over the wall and into the garden. 

Sadly, my efforts were in vain, for under the cover of darkness the burglar had managed to escape.

I had no alternative but to give up the chase and make my way to hospital, where my bleeding wounds were sewn up and bandaged. 

Throughout this experience and its aftermath, never once did I dream of suing the owner of the house over the injuries I received from his strategically placed broken glass.

I, and all my colleagues, knew that physical damage was an inevitable part of our job in the frontline of the war against crime.

I
was reminded of that incident this week when I read about the 
outrageous decision by PC Kelly Jones, a constable from Norfolk, to take
legal action against the owner of a petrol station in Thetford after 
she tripped up over a kerb while investigating a break-in there.

Unlike
me, the litigious PC Jones does not appear to have suffered any serious
injury at all, yet she is pursuing the garage owner for £50,000.

Shamefully,
she is supported in this frivolous claim not only by a firm of 
self-seeking lawyers but also by the Police Federation, the 
representative body of the force’s personnel. 

What is so disturbing is that this action, despite its absurdity, is hardly an isolated case.

As this paper revealed yesterday, the insidious spread of the compensation culture means police officers are grabbing more than £20 million a year in the settlement of personal-injury claims.

Slips, grazes, falls, and animal attacks are all fodder for this growing barrage of self-serving litigation.

A bruise is no longer just an occupational hazard for a copper, but rather a cue for financial reparation.

All this is a world away from the culture of policing when I was rising through the ranks.

During my career I sustained my fair share of knocks, yet, like all my colleagues, I would have regarded the idea of compensation as laughable, even offensive.

Punches in the face, kicks on the head, pokes in the eye and even a bayonet into my flesh were all part of the job.

‘Back again, Dai?’ the nurses used to say at my local accident-and-emergency department when I turned up with another injury.

On
one occasion, I fell off high school-gates while chasing a burglar, 
landing heavily on my back, but it never occurred to me to sue the 
school or local education authority.

Even more serious was an incident in 1981, when I was driving a Black Maria through Hammersmith in West London.

As I went through the streets, I caught sight of a notorious local 
criminal, wanted for grievous bodily harm, drinking outside a pub.

I
stopped the vehicle, leapt out and walked over to him with the immortal
words: ‘You’re nicked.’ Unfortunately, several of this thug’s family 
were in the pub.

At once, a fracas started, during which I was kicked so forcefully under the chin that my spine was fractured.

WPC Jones tripped while investigating the break in at the Nunns Bridges Service Station in Thetford, Norfolk. Owner Steve Jones said it is example of the 'fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident'

Luckily, I recovered after a spell in hospital. But again, I would never have considered any demand for compensation. All that has changed — and there are several reasons. 

I think it partly reflects a dramatic shift in the nature of modern policing.

When I was in the force, police officers were expected to be tough, both physically and mentally resilient.

Standards
of fitness had to be kept high, something that obviously does not apply
in the case of PC Kelly Jones, who looks like she regards the gym as an
entirely alien environment.

Moreover,
in a predominantly masculine culture, courage was an absolutely core 
quality. We were duty-bound to advance towards danger, rather than hide 
behind risk assessments and safety guidelines.

Because
our task was to protect the public, risk was just part of the job. 
Nowadays, police officers and fire-fighters won’t even go into a 3ft 
pond to rescue someone. 

And
when that kind of risk-averse culture is all you know — and is drummed 
into you by your bosses — then you will probably think it’s perfectly 
acceptable to sue someone if you trip over a kerb.

Despite the dangers, we were nothing like as well-equipped as officers today.

Going
into basements, lofts, factories and alleys, we carried little more 
than a truncheon and a torch, in contrast to the vast array of 
protective gear today’s police wear, which makes them look more like 
American battlefield troops than constables.

But
again it is telling that, despite all the technical advances in 
equipment, PC Jones appears to have overlooked something as basic as 
using her torch. 

In addition, the police over recent decades have increasingly retreated from the streets.

When
I was a serving officer, going out on the beat was regarded as the most
essential element of policing, to deter crime, provide a reassuring 
presence to the public and build a knowledge of a neighbourhood.

The insidious spread of the compensation culture means police officers are grabbing more than £20¿million a year in the settlement of personal-injury claims

Tragically, beat policing is now treated as an irrelevance and given a far lower priority than other tasks such as holding meetings, monitoring the internet, attending training courses or dealing with paperwork.

So officers have far less hard experience of life on the streets.

And when they do venture out, they tend to go in pairs, something that would have been unthinkable in my time because it is such a colossal waste of manpower. 

The justification for this rigid  policy of pairing is that it supposedly helps in the corroboration of evidence at any crime scene, but in reality it shows a crippling lack of self-confidence and authority. 

But perhaps the most important reason for the shift in policing culture is the fact that, like all major institutions, the police mirror the worst changes in our society.

The forces of safety bureaucracy and the compensation culture have been spreading their malign influence across the whole of Britain in recent years, fuelled by measures such as the introduction of ‘no-win, no-fee’ law-suits in 1998, and the notorious Human Rights Act, which has overthrown basic common sense in so many public services.

Only last week, it emerged that teachers are now annually awarded £25 million for injuries and discrimination in the classroom — another indicator of how rife cash-grabbing has become.

But the police should know better. Officers are employed to protect the public, not exploit them for financial gain.

In particular, the Police Federation and senior officers should not be colluding with this destructive trend. 

The Federation should be battling to uphold the true principles of policing that used to serve this country so well, ensuring the spirit of public service remains at the heart of all operations.

Turning itself into a shabby arm of the litigation industry, complete with endless adverts for law firms, is an utter betrayal of those basic values.

Similarly, the top ranks of the force should stop being so supine, obsessed with every nuance of political correctness and desperate to show how progressive they are.

They are not directors of social services or health-and-safety bureaucrats.

They are crime-fighting chiefs, and if they want to do their jobs properly, they need to concentrate on raising standards of fitness, improving recruitment, and putting officers back on the beat.

And with regard to PC Kelly Jones, the worst of it is, she’s far from being the only one milking the taxpayer for injuries that my generation would simply have shrugged off.
