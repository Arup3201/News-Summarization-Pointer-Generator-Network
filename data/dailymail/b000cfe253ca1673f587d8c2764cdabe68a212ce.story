A holiday company is targeting a very specific market after launching breaks ideally suited for swingers and nudists.

Perhaps taking inspiration from the cult following amassed for the Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon, Intimate Places are hoping to provide a 'judgement free holiday for open-minded and adventurous adults, couples and singles searching for a fun-filled, wildly expressive experience.'

And there's nothing 'seedy' about these holidays, they are aimed at offering luxury resorts around the world.

Desire resorts have two bases in Mexico, with both catering for swingers and adults who want to 'experiment'

Guests can relax and take advantage of a 'clothing optional' policy on 'Intimate Places' holidays

Going into a travel agency and booking a holiday that can enhance your fantasies, is probably not the most comfortable of conversations to drum up.

So Surrey-based company Intimate Places decided to provide a service to help people escape from 'the routine, the confines and the limitations' of 'normal' life.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Dave Batley, owner of Intimate Places, said: 'We are no different to any other all-inclusive holiday, except we offer different extra-curricular activities.

'We noticed that if people wanted to book these kind of trips, they would have to book the hotel, then the flights, and then any activities separate.

'By us offering our customers a package holiday, we ensure they are, pardon the pun, fully protected through ATOL.

'We have holidays all around the world, but we are going to have a real look into developing our European offerings.

'I don't think we are any different to a mainstream holiday.'

Batley admitted to believing the furore over the release of Fifty Shades of Grey may have contributed to an increased interest in his company's offerings.

'The website crashed last night, and we are just trying to get everything up and running again,' he added.

'We have already had more enquiries than we would expect; but I think we are simply facilitating something that is already there.' 

There are adults-only cruises to select from, many of which run a 'clothing optional' policy. The website describes these cruises as perfect for 'adventurous couples who want to explore different cultures and countries with freedoms unlike any other cruise.'

These are the perfect opportunity to either relax and be at one with your partner, or for those who wish to 'spice things up,' there will be plenty of opportunity to meet with like-minded adults who are keen to explore new 'sexual horizons.'

The resorts and locations used for Intimate Places' holiday are luxurious and expansive

Of the eight resorts available to guests, Hedonism II in Jamaica provides the greatest scope for engagement for customers.

This hotel is exclusively for adults over 18, reaching out in particular to swingers, nudists and people with erotic interests. 

The majority of guests come from America and it is one of few hotels that also takes singles. 

Singles also have the chance to share their room with someone of the same sex, not the most comfortingly labelled Single Share Risk, but in doing so they can save 50 per cent.

The Spice Resort in Lanzarote has an outdoor jacuzzi that can hold 50 people, making it the ideal spot for couple to meet others.

There is also the PLay Room -  the most erotic part of the hotel, and the ideal place for couples to meet other couples.

Batley added: 'I've worked in the travel industry for many years and have seen the demand for swingers' holidays continue to grow. 

'I wanted to create a new company that provides dedicated advice and specialism for those interested in the swingers and naturist lifestyle. We allow the freedom of openly talking about your lifestyle choices without any embarrassment.

'Here at Intimate Places we will listen to your specific wishes and offer tailor-made suggestions on the best resorts and holidays whilst also providing our customers with a top-notch discreet service based on our expertise and understanding.' 

Prices start from £1,441 per person based on two people sharing and return UK flights at the Desire Resorts in Mexico.

A five-night cruise calling at San Juan, Puerto Rico, St Croix and St Marteen, with return flights  start from £1,500 per person.
