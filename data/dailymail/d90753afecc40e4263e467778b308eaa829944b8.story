Wall Street bankers are enjoying an average salary more than five times higher than the rest of the private sector in New York City, a report says.

The average salary last year in the city’s securities industry - in which financial workers deal in debt, equities and derivatives - was $361,330.

Comparing this to the average of $66,120 in the rest of the private sector will only fuel the outrage of Occupy Wall Street protesters.

Disparities: The average salary last year in the city's securities industry was $361,330, compared to the average of $66,120 in the rest of the private sector

Average salaries in the securities industry 30 years ago were only double those in the rest of the private sector, reported the New York Times.

New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s report came as city protestors continued to push for the state to extend a tax on millionaires.

Total bonuses paid to workers in the city’s securities industry fell last year by eight per cent to $21billion following a 27 per cent rise in 2009.

But wages - including bonuses - went up by 14 per cent last year to $58billion, although they remained below the 2007 record of $74billion.

Last year almost a quarter (24 per cent) of all private sector wages were in the securities industry, even though it has just 5 per cent of the jobs.

The average securities salary grew last year by 16 per cent to $361,330. The salary gap peaked in 2007 before falling for the next two years.

The average compensation for S&P 500 CEOs was $11.4million last year - almost 350 times the median pay of U.S. workers ($33,190). 

The gap has risen around eightfold since 1980 and is still only 25:1 in Europe, reported LiveScience.

But the report added: ‘In 2010, the disparity between the securities industry and other employment sectors widened.

‘The average salary in the securities industry in New York City was also much higher than in such jobs in the rest of New York State ($209,500).

‘The higher salaries in New York City reflect a greater concentration of the most highly compensated positions in the industry.’

One in three of the city's jobs lost in the recession was in finance - and 10,000 more in securities could go within 14 months, reported the New York Times.
