Gobble a banana while riding the escalator, pause for a coffee in between outlets, have a quick power nap in a changing cubicle...

Everyone has their own way of staying in high spirits and bountiful energy while doing that most exhausting of activities: shopping.

But perhaps what you really need to be doing is long-term training on the specific muscles you use while lugging bags and boxes up and down the high-street and repeatedly lifting dresses up and over your head. And now you can.

The Shopper's Workout will strengthen the core muscles you use while on a shopping trip, making it easier for you to lug bags up escalators and run for the bus while laden with groceries

A London gym has created a retail-inspired work-out for the shopaholic in us all, a 30-minute routine packed with lunges, planks, squats and Russian twists, each promising to tighten and strengthen your 'shopping muscles'.

The shopping work-out begins with a 10-minute warm-up walk on the treadmill - the equivalent of waking to the bus stop. The speed then cranks up for 10 minutes on the stepper (imagine you're running up the escalators to beat the sales rush).

You then launch into three sets of 20 lunges while holding a set of dumbbells: just imagine picking dropped T-shirts off the floor while holding a screaming child over your shoulders.

After a few months of the shopper's workout you'll be able to strut confidently down Oxford Street half-naked like these chaps, the glamorous Dream Idols

Drop into the plank and hold yourself there for one minute, recreating the scene in which you're lying on the changing room floor struggling to squeeze yourself into a pair of skinny jeans.

Now it's time for squats. Hold a barbell over your shoulders to make more difficult and drop into 12 repetitions, for three sets. Envisage yourself reaching for shoes on the low shelf. Lots of times.

Then throw yourself into 30 seconds of Russian twists - the same movement you do while pulling on jeggings - followed by three sets of 12 kettlebell Sumo squats, to strengthen your bag-carrying arm muscles.

Exhaustion such as this will be a thing of the past once you've perfected the work-out and trained your muscles to carry heavy bags with ease and take escalator steps two at a time

At last it's time for a round of Swissball crunches to strengthen your running-for-the-bus core, and then a 10-minute cool down on the cross-trainer, the equivalent of the long, awkward trudge home with your shopping bags.

The retail-routine has been created by easyGym, the new premium-budget gym from easyJet founder Stelios, to celebrate the launch of its new Oxford Street flagship, where membership costs £19.99 per month.

Paul Lorimer-Wing, CEO of easyGym said:  'EasyGym Oxford Street is our most ambitious project ever, offering fantastic facilities at a fraction of the price of the big boys.  We hope our new shopper's work out will give shoppers a leg up too.'
