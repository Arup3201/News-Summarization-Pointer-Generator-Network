The full story behind the 'shoplifting' grandfather body slammed to the ground emerged today, as the nation searched its soul following the chaotic, sometimes violent, scenes of greed on Black Friday.

Jerald Allen Newman, 54, has come to symbolise the mayhem of the day after he was videoed with blood streaming down his face as he was arrested by police officers in Phoenix, Arizona.

The police say he was shoplifting and sustained the injuries because he resisted arrest and became aggressive after being found with a video game down his pants.

But Mr Newman's tearful eight-year-old grandson, Nick, 
has spoken out to defend his grandfather to ABC News, saying: 'I only got one game and 
people were trying to take it away from me and put it under his shirt so
 no one would take it'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Out cold: Jerald Allen Newman was knocked unconscious after a police officer kicked his leg out from under him while arresting him. Blood began pooling on the floor as officers handcuffed him

'Brutality': In the video, customers shout at the police and accuse them of using unnecessary force while arresting Mr Newman

Mr Newman's family insist that he was trying
 to protect young Nick from a mob of marauding bargain
 hunters who were trampling him during an uncontrollable stampede at a 
video game display in Wal-Mart.

The ordeal terrified Nick, who sobbed as he talked about it nearly two days later.

'Never go there on Black Friday, because if you go, you will get hurt,' the boy said about his local Wal-Mart.

It
 was just one of many chaotic scenes that saw near-riots break out, one 
shopper shot and a woman pepper spray 20 others at a Wal-Mart in 
California.

Women fought over yoga pants in Pennsylvania and police used pepper spray to disperse a crowd in North Carolina.

The 
graphic video of Mr Newman's arrest is the most poignant image to emerge
 from the violence that broke out across the country as hysterical mobs 
of shoppers flooded stores late Thursday and early Friday looking for 
deep discounts on Christmas gifts.

Terrified: Mr Newman's eight-year-old grandson Nick said his grandfather was only trying to protect him from the mob of shoppers

The woman who allegedly blasted rival
 shoppers with pepper spray at a Los Angles Wal-Mart has turned herself 
into police, authorities said.

She could face battery charges but is not currently in police custody. Her identity was not released.

In
 Arizona, police countered witnesses statements about Mr Newman's arrest and say he resisted officers and began to flail while being handcuffed.

'He's responsible,' said Larry Hall, the Assistant Police Chief in Buckeye, Arizona.

The video, posted on YouTube, shows Mr
 Newman unconscious and covered in blood after a police officer forced 
him to the ground Thursday night.

Officers
 in the video try to sop up blood as outraged customers yell expletives 
and say 'that's police brutality' and 'he wasn't doing anything.'

'Are you sure that was necessary for shoplifting?' said one shopper. 'Why would you throw him down so hard?'

Mr Newman suffered a bloody nose and gash on his head requiring four stitches.

Witnesses
 described pandemonium at the Walmart video game display. Out-of-control
 customers ripped apart the display box holding the games. One woman was punched
 during the melee, according to reports.

Mr Newman's grandson got caught up in the crowd and was knocked to the ground, cutting his lip.

Witnesses say Mr Newman stuck the game in his waistband under his shirt to help free his hands so he could protect the boy.

A Wal-Mart security guard saw Mr Newman and brought him over to local police officers.

'They grabbed the guy, body planted him 
into the ground -- face shatters on concrete. That's a hard concrete 
floor inside Wal-Mart,' Skylar Stone, who said he witnessed the entire 
exchange, told Fox 10 in Phoenix.

'All of a sudden, you see this little boy run up and wailing and yelling, "Grandpa, Grandpa," and crying his eyes out.'

More chaos: Arizona wasn't the only state with Black Friday frenzy. Here, a mob rushes an Urban Outfitters in California

The police report describes a chaotic scene in the Walmart, where customers were made to wait until 10pm Thanksgiving Day.

About 200 people surrounded the stand and inched closer and closer despite officers warning them to stay back.

'I observed the crowd rush in and attack the cardboard displays with 
video games flying through the air and the cardboard displays being 
thrown around and broken completely down flat on the ground,' one 
officer wrote in the report.

Another officer described seeing a man get trampled and helping him 
to safety, while another officer saw a woman walking away from the stand
 with a young girl who was crying and holding her mouth in pain.

One customer reported that people yanked three video games from him, leaving him empty-handed.

Combat: Up to 20 people in a California Walmart were hit with pepper spray after a woman unleashed the noxious chemical to ward off other shoppers vying for XBoxes

The Arizona Wal-Mart wasn't the only store where chaos reigned.

A Los Angeles shopper used pepper-spray on 20 fellow bargain hunters in a battle to reach a cart of heavily-discounted XBox consoles at a Wal-Mart.

A shopper was shot and critically wounded in a robbery at a Wal-Mart in San Leandro, California.

In Fayetteville, North Carolina, gunfire at 2 a.m. on Black Friday morning sent shoppers diving for cover at a shopping mall.

Police were also investigating a possible shooting in the car park of Valley West Mall in West Des Moines, Iowa.

Force: Gordon Jackson was arrested at a Walmart in Kingston, North Carolina, after he complained about police using pepper spray on a crowd

A Phoenix, Arizona, Wal-Mart had to be evacuated Thanksgiving day for a bomb scare after an employee found a suspicious package that police said appeared to be an explosive.

At an Urban Outfitters at Thousand Oaks Mall outside Los Angeles, a frenzied mob trampled theft protection systems as they flooded into the store.

An off-duty police officer working as a security guard at a Walmart in Kingston, North Carolina, used pepper spray on a crowd of 30 to 40 shoppers. He then arrested a man who protested the use of force.

Women and girls outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reportedly erupted into a very un-zen-like brawl over yoga pants that were on sale at Victoria's Secret.

Retailers estimate 152 million shoppers spilled into stores for Black Friday.

Assistant Chief Hall defended his officer's against against Mr Newman, who he said was resisting arrest and the officer acted within reason.

Assistant Chief Hall did not release the name of the officer, who was hired by Walmart to work at the store while he was off duty. He was one of five law enforcement officers hired by the store to deal with Thursday night crowds.

Assistant Chief Hall said a Walmart employee alerted the officer involved that Newman had put a video game in his waistband, and that the officer approached Newman and started to arrest him.

When he had handcuffs on one of Newman's wrists, Assistant Chief Hall said Mr Newman told the officer, 'I'm not going to jail,' and started pulling away and flailing.

Not so Zen: Shopper Liz Wentling told CBS girls and mothers in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, were punching each other at a Victoria's Secret store where a great deal on yoga clothing was causing a stir

The police spokesman said Mr Newman continued resisting and the officer decided to sweep Mr Newman's legs out from underneath him and drop him to the ground.

'Unfortunately, the suspect landed on his head,' Assistant Chief Hall said.

The officer involved wrote in the police report that he yelled at Newman to 'stop resisting!' before deciding to force him to the ground.

'The store was incredibly crowded, and I was concerned about other customers' safety and possibly getting involved,' he wrote.

'I then utilized a leg sweep with my right leg as I pulled down with my arms to take Jerald to the ground to better affect the arrest and protect the other shoppers.'

Big deals: Retailers estimate 152 million people went out Friday to buy Christmas gifts

The report said that Newman's grandson was treated and released for his injuries by firefighters at the scene.

Hall said an administrative review will be conducted to assess the officer's use of force, but it appeared to be justified.

'The officer didn't lift the guy over his head and slam him to the ground,' he said.

'He used a minimum amount of force, the suspect resisted arrest, and the officer actually could have escalated his use of force. But he didn't. He used his hands to take the suspect into custody.'

An ambulance took Newman to the hospital, where he got four stitches for a cut on the left side of his forehead. His nose was also bloodied but not broken, Assistant Chief Hall said.

Mr Newman was then booked into the Maricopa County jail on suspicion of shoplifting and resisting arrest.

Police found Newman's 8- or 9-year-old grandson crying after the incident and turned him over to his grandmother, who police described as hysterical.

'The wife was so upset and told me Jerald was just trying to protect his grandson that got trampled in the crowd and just placed a video game under his shirt while grabbing his grandson to get out of the crowd,' wrote one officer.
