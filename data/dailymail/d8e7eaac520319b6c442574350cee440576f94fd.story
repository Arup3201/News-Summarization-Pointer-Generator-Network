QPR owner Tony Fernandes hopes sought-after striker Loic Remy remains with the Premier League new-boys this season so he can play FIFA 15 against him. 

The French international has been linked with a move away from Loftus Road all summer, famously failing a medical ahead of signing for Liverpool.

And while Fernandes told talkSPORT it is their loss and QPR's gain, he also said he is ready to strengthen his 'special bond' with Remy playing the video game.

Big season: Fernandes was talking to talkSPORT ahead of QPR's Premier League reunion

'It is Liverpool's loss and our gain,' he said on the Alan Brazil Breakfast Show.

'I have a special relationship with Remy from playing FIFA with him and I hope to continue playing FIFA 15 with him throughout the season!

'Nothing is ever cast in stone in football, but I am moderately optimistic Remy will be wearing the Hoops' shirt throughout this season.'

No getaway: Remy failed a medical ahead of a move to Liverpool earlier this summer

QPR gained promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs last season, and Fernandes has praised the job Harry Redknapp has done at the club.

The Malaysian owner is also happy with his dealings in the transfer market this summer, having attracted the likes of Jordon Mutch, Steven Caulker and Rio Ferdinand to west London.
