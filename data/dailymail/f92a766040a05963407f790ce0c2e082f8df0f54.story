A coroner has asked the police to investigate the following what he called a doctor's 'extraordinary' delay in treating a seriously ill baby.

Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries halted an inquest this afternoon and said he would be sending the notes to the Crown Prosecution Service to investigate a possible case of gross negligent manslaughter.

The inquest heard that seven-week-old 
Summer Hawcroft died from a severe brain injury after her artificial 
breathing tube became dislodged in the neo-natal unit at Barnsley 
District Hospital.

There was a 'window' of about 30 minutes before Dr Vishwanath Kamoji, who was in charge of Summer, reacted and had the endotracheal tube changed.

Experts said that it was probably during a 30-minute window that Summer Hawcroft was starved of oxygen leading to the brain injury

Heartbroken mother Michaela Hawcroft 
accused locum paediatric consultant Dr Kamoji of 'killing her baby' 
after an expert said they hoped the doctor had learned from his 
mistakes.

Tearful Mrs Hawcroft, 26, interrupted the Sheffield hearing and said: 'It's all right sticking up for him. He killed my baby.'

Experts have told the inquest the tube had been incorrectly fitted by Dr Kamoji and it was probable that the baby was starved of oxygen during this time, leading to the brain injury.

Professor Simon Mitchell, a consultant neo-natologist called to give evidence for Summer's family, said there were several clinical failings by Dr Kamoji which amounted to a 'fundamental error' having been made.

He failed to discover the tube had 
been dislodged and properly assess the baby, did not secure her airways,
ignored the clinical picture and dismissed concerns voiced by fellow 
nurses and a junior doctor.

In the end he brought in an on-call consultant before making the decision to change the tube.

Prof
Mitchell said: 'I think Dr Kamoji made an error in his clinical 
judgment and this was a fundamental error during a resuscitation 
situation which was compounded by failure to take account of information
which was being made available to him.'

The inquest has already heard from 
another paediatric expert Dr Martin Ward Platt that the consultant's 
inaction during the 30-minute period amounted to 'gross failure' and he 
should have changed the tube earlier.

Summer was the seventh child of builder Stephen and Michaela Hawcroft

Summer, who weighed only two pounds and two ounces when born on April 23, 2011 by caesarean section after 27 weeks gestation, had a promising start but began to suffer breathing problems.

She required several intubations and ventilation to aid her breathing but during the early hours of May 4 began to deteriorate.

Dr Kamoji inserted a larger endotracheal tube at 2.40am but her condition worsened and she collapsed at 5.03am. Staff were particularly alarmed as the baby had a large amount of gas in her stomach.

They summoned Dr Kamoji who arrived minutes before 5.35am and did checks but failed to spot the tube had become dislodged. It was eventually replaced at 6.03am.

By this time the damage was done and Summer was transferred to a specialist unit in Sheffield where she died on June 11 when she was just 49 days old.

Prof Mitchell told the hearing the tube fitted by Dr Kamoji was 'much higher than you would wish it to be' and the infant's abdomen was visibly distended indicating the tube was incorrectly placed.

An X-ray was taken at 5.40am but not 
viewed until 6am by the doctor. 'You would want to see it as soon as 
possible,' said Prof Mitchell. 'If the tube is in the wrong place and 
the baby is not being ventilated properly that is an urgent situation.'

He
said the consultant's primary aim in resuscitating Summer should have 
been to establish that Summer had a secure and open airway.

The
lack of an airway was 'likely to have caused significant brain 
damage.

He added: 'There was a fundamental failure and it was unusually 
persistent.'

He did not believe there was any criminal culpability but calling in a second consultant to remove the tube was 'most unusual.'

Summer's artificial breathing tube became dislodged in the neo-natal unit at Barnsley District Hospital

Dr Janet Rennie, a consultant neo-natologist called by Dr Kamoji's legal team, told the inquest the tube must have moved some time after 5am but nobody had been able to pinpoint why.

Sher agreed there was an 'error of judgment' by Dr Kamoji in failing to replace the tube during the 30-minute window but in her opinion it was not serious enough to be reported to the medical authorities.

He should have revisited standard resuscitation procedures when the baby collapsed and had adopted a 'blinkered' approach which was a breach of duty.

'As events did unfold it becomes less understandable and less rational but judgment becomes clouded by the stress of these situations,' she said.

Summer was the seventh child of builder Stephen Hawcroft and Michaela, of Kendray, Barnsley.

Pathologist Dr Mudher Al-Adnani said she died from a hypoxic brain injury which was 'quite extensive and widespread' but it could have been a combination of several factors rather than a single event.

Dr Kamoji qualified as a doctor in India in March, 1993 and has practised in the UK since 2000. He has worked as a senior house officer on neo-natal units in Lincolnshire, Gwent, Leicester and Nottingham and has been on the specialist paediatrics register since August, 2009.

After the inquest was adjourned Mtthew Brown, the family's solicitor said: 'Although they continue to grieve for Summer my clients are pleased that Mr Dorries has recognised the magnitude of the failures in her care at Barnsley Hospital by referring the case to the Crown Prosecution Service.

'We now await a decision on whether a criminal prosecution for gross negligent manslaughter will be pursued.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
