You’ve got to be pretty driven to win this competition.

Contestants in China competed in a gruelling contest to win a brand new BMW X1 in which the keys were given to the person who could stand on one leg for the longest – while touching the car.

The stunt started in Jiangxi Province on March 1 with more than 140 participants hopping to it and entering three elimination phases.

Amazing feet: People take part in a car touching contest to win a new BMW X1 in Jiangxi Province, China

Exhausted: The physical strain of the BMW competition was clear to see

Stages: There were various legs in the competition with 20 people battling it out in the final

On March 16 20 competitors took part in the final phase.

The game started at 9:30am. All competitors were asked to touch the BMW with one hand and stand on one foot.

At 13:30pm, to add to the difficulty, participants were required to stand on tiptoe on one foot.

Organisers even spread flour under each person’s foot to ensure that they didn’t rest their heel on the ground.

Strict: The judges even put flour under contestants' heels so they could check if they'd cheated

Painful: The record for standing on one leg is 76 hours and 40 minutes - which no one at the BMW competition came close to matching

Agony: The contestants had to remain on one spot on the car

Wheel-y pleased: Winner Wu Deqi, who stood on one leg for over seven hours

The agony the contestants endured is clear to see, with some lying down in a state of total exhaustion after their efforts.

At 3:56pm - 7 hours and 26 minutes after the stunt began - Wu Qide became the last man standing and won a new BMW.

Seven hours pales, however, next to the Guinness World Record for standing on one leg. It's held by Suresh Joachim, who balanced on one foot for an incredible 76 hours and 40 minutes.
