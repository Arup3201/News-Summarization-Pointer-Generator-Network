Natascha Kampusch has revealed she was raped by her kidnapper Wolfgang Priklopil during the eight-and-a-half years she was held captive at his house.

She made the revelation during a television interview in Germany yesterday - her 25th birthday - ahead of the release of the film 3,096 Days.

The film is based on her memoir, which takes its name from the number of days spent in captivity.

Miss Kampusch has previously refused to comment on the sexual side of the complex relationship she developed with Priklopil.

The upcoming film is based on Miss Kampusch's memoir of her ordeal

The film, starring Northern Irish actor Antonia Campbell-Hughes as Miss Kampusch, will be released across Europe this month and shows Priklopil taking his young captor out of the cellar he constructed beneath his house near Vienna and raping her.

Speaking to talk show host Günter Jauch, Miss Kampusch said police evidence had reached 'the public domain'.

She said this made her agree to changes in the film's script which showed the assaults.

Jauch asked her: 'So you are saying now to the public: this is what happened, now please leave me in peace?'

She replied; 'Yes'.

Priklopil was an Austrian communications 
technician who kidnapped
Kampusch on the morning of March 2 1998 on her way to 
school.

He kept her in a custom built basement under his house in Strasshof near
Gänserndorf, in Lower Austria.

Miss Kampusch escaped on August 23 2006 while Priklopil took a phone call.

He killed himself by lying down in front of a train shortly after her escape.

Miss Kampusch, who has made an estimated five million pounds in TV and magazine interviews and book sales, still has mixed feelings about the man she calls 'the criminal'.

She reportedly carries a photo of him around with her at all times, lives in his house, maintains his car and travels under a false name to foreign countries because of the attention she gets.

Miss Kampusch said last night that she wished Priklopil had lived to tell his side of the story.

She said the cellar in his house, which she now owns, has been filled in.

She said: 'That feels good.'

Speaking about life after her escape, she said: 'I'm trying to commit to each day positively, to process what is happening to me.

'That I was a child when it happened really helped me. As a child you are still naive and believe in justice.'

She says she was the intellectual superior of Priklopil, who had never had a girlfriend and whose plan was to groom Natascha until she fell in love with him.

'The more information I learned about him, the more I could see through his intentions,' she said.

'I can never do the carefree youth thing. What helps me is talking with other other people who share their experiences of youth with me.'

Wolfgang Priklopi killed himself after Natascha Kampusch escaped from his home, eight years after her kidnap

Miss Kampusch has frequently been accused of not taking opportunities to escape from Priklopil.

The bungled police investigation to find her after her disappearance is still being probed by German and Austrian investigators.

Miss Kampusch said that although she went shopping with Priklopil, and once on a ski holiday, there was no opportunity for escape.

She said: 'There were years of pressure on me. It was like an internal prison which made it impossible to flee. That was pure fear.

'He said he would stab anyone who tried to help me.'

John Egan, a child kidnap victim, and a German journalist who was tortured in Iran joined the discussion after 45 minutes.

All three concurred that it was important to maintain contact with their tormentor and to remain, after freedom, in the role of the victim.

But she said that her 'martyrdom' is often challenged in Austria because people don't believe her side of the story.

Some politicians and lawmen believe Priklopil had an accomplice and that Miss Kampusch has not told the whole truth about what went on during the years she spent with him.

'For me, this is very hard to bear, because I am almost pushed to the point of living abroad - or to kill myself,' she said.
