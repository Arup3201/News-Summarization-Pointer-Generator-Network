Nick Clegg today hit out at the Guardian for publishing secret files which served ‘no purpose’ other than to aid terrorists who want to harm Britain.

The Lib Dem leader joined the barrage of criticism that the newspaper released UK’s intelligence secrets of no interest to readers but highly-valued by fanatics and foreign spies.

It follows MI5 director-general Andrew Parker’s warning this week that the leaks are a ‘gift’ to terrorists.

Criticism: In a highly-unusual move, Nick Clegg criticised the Guardian's decision to publish secret files which would only have been of interest to terrorists

The publication of secret files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden are said to have caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services.

Security officials fear the data will be used by terrorists to avoid detection when plotting an atrocity.

The Guardian has argued its revelations have ‘prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue’.

But Mr Clegg rubbished the idea that highly-sensitive intelligence needed to be released in order to prompt discussions about the scale of the surveillance state.

In an unusual attack on the left-wing newspaper, Mr Clegg said: ‘I think it’s a totally legitimate debate about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how do you make sure these technologies are used in a proportionate and accountable way. 

‘But, I don’t think just giving technical secrets, if I can put it that way, to people who want to do us harm serves any purpose.’

Speaking on his weekly phone-in on LBC 97.3, he added: ‘I’ve got no doubt that there were some parts of what was published which will have passed most readers of the Guardian completely by, because they were very technical, but would have been of immense interest to people who want to do us harm.

'I certainly agree that if what you end up doing is just basically publishing very technical information, that actually most Guardian readers, or most of us wouldn’t frankly understand, but the only people who will understand are the sort of technicians if you like amongst the terrorists, then what’s the public interest in that?'

Fury: The spy chief: MI5 director-general Andrew Parker has blasted the Guardian's publication of Britain's espionage capabilities

His comments came after Mr Parker warned that the disclosure of the ‘reach and limits’ of the GCHQ's capabilities was a gift  to terrorists.

In a speech this week Mr Parker said: ‘It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists.

'It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.’

Guardian newspaper editor Alan Rusbridger was described as 'naive'

Mr Parker dismissed suggestions that 
the agencies were trawling through people's private lives for anything 
that looked interesting as ‘utter nonsense’.

Yesterday
David Cameron backed Mr Parker. A No 10 spokesman – when asked whether 
Mr Cameron agreed with Mr Parker’s comments – said: ‘The Prime Minister 
thinks it was an excellent speech and we are, as you would expect, 
always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute 
to keeping our country safe. I would happily point you to all parts of 
the director general’s speech.’

Mr Clegg argued that secrecy was vital in order to keep the country safe.

‘We have legislation, and regulations, which were designed for an age which is quite different now, and both terrorists and States and security agencies, now conduct this battle, if you like, online in a way that was unimaginable just even a few years ago. 

‘And, what that means for privacy and proportionality, I think that’s a totally legitimate area for debate. 

‘How you hold the secret parts of any State to account is an incredibly important issue, because secrecy is necessary, of course it is, you absolutely must defend the principle of secrecy from the intelligence agencies without which they can’t keep us safe. 

‘But, you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is proper form of accountability.’

Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger denied putting lives at risk and – defying security officials – said he would continue publishing top secret information, which the paper has been splashing across its front pages since June.

In an interview yesterday he said: ‘We are working slowly and responsibly but as we discover further stories that we think merit the debate, the debate that everyone says is necessary, then we will go on publishing.’

The first Guardian revelations came in early June, when it detailed how the NSA – which supplies intelligence to GCHQ, the organisation which gathers intelligence for MI5 and MI6 – had ‘direct access’ to the computer systems of AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Paltalk, Skype, Yahoo and YouTube.

The newspaper also revealed how GCHQ has access to a network of cables carrying international phone calls and internet traffic and is processing vast amounts of ‘personal information’.

By the time his identity as the source of the leaks emerged, Snowden had fled his home in Hawaii for Hong Kong. After a week in hiding, he travelled to Moscow, where he remains out of the reach of US authorities.
