Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed the marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes

A London Marathon runner - who apparently completed the second half of the race quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah - has denied claims he cheated.

Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, was accused of duping race officials yesterday after it emerged he completed the second leg of the marathon in just one hour, one minute - three minutes shy of the world record.

But the personal trainer has defended the result, saying: 'I have done nothing wrong. This was my sixth London marathon.

'I'm a personal trainer. I train every day, seven days a week for the past seven years. Nobody thinks maybe I just trained hard.

Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, he added: 'Nobody thinks "maybe he paced himself through the first half and when the second half came he just let himself go."'

Mr Scotland-Williams, 34, completed this year’s marathon in a total of three hours eight minutes - knocking more than four hours off his last time of seven hours 24 minutes.

The aspiring model, from Hammersmith, London, ran the first half of the marathon in two hours and seven minutes – an average time for an amateur athlete.

However, he apparently ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic hero Mo Farah who completed the same stretch in one hour and five minutes.

It means Scotland-Williams finished the race in an impressive three hours and eight minutes – putting him in the top six per cent of competitors.

However, online forums are awash with claims the runner cheated his way to the super-fast time, with some speculating he jumped over a waist-high barrier at the halfway point at Tower Bridge.

It is alleged he jumped the barrier separating the 13-mile marker from the 22-mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round Canary Wharf and doubled back.

It is claimed he then jumped back into the race, joining a leading group of runners, and sprinted his way to the finish.

London Marathon organisers are investigating Jason Scotland-Williams' time after he ran the second half of the race in just over an hour. Internet forums are awash with claims he jumped over a barrier in the Tower Bridge area

Jason Scotland-Williams' result suggests he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah, above,  who completed the same stretch in one hour five minutes

The 
official London Marathon website logs his progress around the first half
 of the course, giving updates for every 5kms he completed.

However,
 it only gives estimated times at the 25km, 30km and 35km markers – 
which has prompted critics to believe he either cheated his way to the 
finish by dodging those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate 
at those points.

However, his chip was working as he passed the 40km point and the finish line – which reveals he completed the last 13 miles in just one hour and one minute.

The allegations come as BBC new presenter Sophie Raworth revealed she was stopped by 'jobsworth' officials 400 yards from the finish line and  wrongly accused of cheating.

Writing on Twitter, Raworth said she had to push past a female official close to Buckingham Palace after she was stopped and accused of having a fake number.

BBC news presenter Sophie Raworth, who completed the marathon in three hours 48 minutes, complained of being wrongly stopped by an official along with fellow runner Eliot Fineberg

Responding to her tweet, Eliot Fineberg, who was running the marathon to raise money for charity, claimed to have been stopped by the same official for seven minutes.

Eliot says the woman also accused him of having a fake number, adding that she could tell 'by the look in your eye' that he was lying.

When he also tried to give her the brush-off, the official threatened to call the police.

Eliot says he had to wait seven minutes while two other officials were called over to check the number, which turned out to be legitimate.

He said he was 'gutted' at being held up after training for six months for his first marathon.

Scotland-Williams had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, the page was closed down this morning

Elsewhere, forum users have questioned Mr Scotland-Williams
 speedy time, suggesting it would have been a ‘miracle’ if he managed to
 complete the second half of the race in such a short space of time.

One
 user, Chris Pearson, posted on a forum on Runners World: ‘First half 
seems fair enough.  Second half is nothing short of a miracle.

‘It is possible that he ran easy for the first half, then went all out in the second half. 

‘However, it would need a chip malfunction at 25, 30, and 35k for this to have happened.

‘It
 would also mean that he is capable of running a half at just over 60 
minute pace, which again is possible if he was a World class elite 
runner, but certainly not after doing a 13.1 mile warm up.’ 

Another user, Millsy1977 - a fellow marathon runner - said: ‘If it was legit he would have sped past me on Birdcage walk. I know I was tired but I think I'd have noticed someone 4.30 miling.’

Another marathon runner, Darryl Morris, said: ‘I saw Jason just after Tower Bridge and he was absolutely smashing it’, before adding: ‘Just noted the barrier skip … that would make complete sense as to why I saw him there, looking so fresh!’

And Ryan T said: ‘If he did cheat then I think a ban is in order, I worked very hard for my time this year, did a sub 3:30 for my first marathon and went through a lot of pain in the last three miles, if people are skipping out miles then shame on them!’

Virgin Money London Marathon confirmed Scotland-Williams’ results were being investigated.

A spokesman told The Sun: ‘We have anti-cheating measures during the event, and then post-event when we analyse split times from points around the course.

‘Runners found to have cheated are removed from results and banned from future events.’

Scotland-Williams, who wore a V for Vendetta mask during last weekend’s race, has taken part in the London Marathon for the last six years.

He had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, his profile was removed from the social-networking site this morning.

This year he was running to raise money for deaf-blind charity Sense.

A spokesman for the charity said: ‘An allegation that a runner cheated at the London Marathon has been brought to our attention.

‘We are urgently investigating and would be very disappointed if this was true.’

The Sun reported it tried to contact Scotland-Williams but was told to ‘f*** off’. 

MailOnline has contacted Virgin Money London Marathon for a comment but organisers have not yet responded.

Anthony Gaskell was stripped of his 'fastest pensioner' title after admitting that he took a short cut during the 2010 London Marathon

Jason Stockland-Williams is not the first competitor to be accused of cheating in the London Marathon.

In 2010, Anthony Gaskell, 69, crossed the finishing line in a mere three hours and five minutes – throwing himself into the record books as the fastest time ever recorded by anyone over 65.

He was due to receive a plaque marking his achievement until analysis of the race revealed he must have completed the second half in under an hour - a pace that even the world record holder could not match.

Six weeks after the event, Mr Gaskell was stripped of his 'fastest pensioner' title after admitting that he took a short cut.

He used a part of the course just after Tower Bridge - where the marathon doubles back on itself - to cut from the outward leg to the home leg, taking around ten miles off the course.

At the time, the grandfather from Wirral, Merseyside, said: 'I have been called a cheat and disqualified from a race I never claimed to have won.'

He claimed he was injured after falling over a runner ahead of him who had tripped on a safety barrier and said: 'I couldn't possibly continue.'

He insists he never claimed to have run the last part of the course and that he did not try to pass off the winning time as his own.

In 2011, a runner was disqualified from the 20-mile Kielder Marathon in Northumberland after catching a bus for the most of the last six miles.

Rob Sloan flagged down a bus and was driven the six miles to the race’s closing stages.

He then jumped off, hid behind a tree until other competitors came into view and re-joined the race, crossing the finishing line in two hours, 51 minutes and one second to secure third place.

He went on to tell a TV crew that he had given the race everything he could.

However, inevitably, the truth came out and Mr Sloan was stripped of his medal and disqualified from the race.

Race officials said Mr Sloan had admitted cheating.
