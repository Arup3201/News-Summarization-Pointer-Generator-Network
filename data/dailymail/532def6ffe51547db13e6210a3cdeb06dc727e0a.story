Tracy Anderson has helped countless celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow get their enviable physiques.

Now the trainer, 39, has revealed her secrets on how to combat ageing and banish bingo wings on the actress's lifestyle website Goop.

But her tips may leave the reader more confused than inspired as she writes about having 'conversations with our bodies' and ensuring our muscles don't have 'atrophy-induced holes'.

Fit friends: Tracy Anderson, right, has helped Gwyneth Paltrow maintain her perfect figure 

Exercise expert: Tracy shows off her flat stomach at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2014 but finding out how she did it from her recent Goop post isn't crystal clear

Using some unusual rhetoric, Tracy states: 'If you spend your life nurturing your innate ability to move your body in a way that continuously sparks a new conversation - within the same philosophy - you will keep your muscles vital and engaged. 

'By doing that, you will have a live working wire that doesn't have atrophy-induced holes that create cellulite and sagging skin tone as you age.'   

It must all make sense to Gwyneth, 42, who has long extolled Tracy's virtues as a personal trainer.

She's no stranger to nonsensical jargon, famously referring to her split from Chris Martin, the father of her two children, as 'conscious uncoupling'.  

The actress, pictured making a TV appearance with Tracy in 2013, is no stranger to confusing jargon

Put simply, mother-of-two Tracy is saying the secret to having firmer, younger looking skin is to exercise more, doing strength and conditioning moves that give you an all body workout - and that don't just focus on one group of muscles.

She said: 'If you have a tight, strong, and healthy muscle design, and you are good at cardio, sweating, and detoxifying, then your skin will age much better.'

She adds that there's 'no pill, cleanse, or quick fix' that is going to 'outperform exercise' when it comes to rolling back the years.

So if you want a healthy body and want to stay looking young, you're going to have to work for it.

By using her method of workouts targeting specific muscle groups, she claims you won't have to worry about 'chicken wings' (aka bingo wings, the dreaded under arm flab).

She blames poor 'muscular design' for the phenomenon and suggests developing a 'tight and strong' upper arm through plenty of exercise. 

She said this will help the skin age better and reduce the loss of collagen and proteins that cause it to sag.

These are the principles she shares in her famous '30 Day Method' which has helped stars like Gwyneth, Madonna and Kim Kardashian stay in shape.

Tracy urges women not to wait until their forties or fifties to take action on having a healthy body as the muscles will begin to age in the thirties.

Or as she puts it: 'We all need to wear gym t-shirts that say "later-life knowledge seeker" for our muscles, because for them to stay "young," just like the rest of our system, they need to be fed and challenged regularly.'
