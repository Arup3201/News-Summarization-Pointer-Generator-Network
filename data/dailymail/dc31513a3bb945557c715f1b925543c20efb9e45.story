Underworld figure Carl Williams would not have been lying when he implicated a former Victorian detective and a hit man in the murder of a police informer, his ex-wife Roberta says.

Terence Hodson and his wife Christine were found shot dead at their Kew home, east of Melbourne, in May 2004, shortly before Mr Hodson was due to give evidence in a criminal trial against drug squad detective Paul Dale.

Mr Dale and contract killer Rodney Charles Collins were charged with the Hodsons' murders in 2009, but the charges were dropped in 2010 when Williams was killed in prison.

Carl Williams' ex-wife Roberta fronted Victorian Coroners Court on Wednesday for the inquest into police informant Terence Hodson and his wife Christine's deaths in 2004

Ms Williams told an inquest on Wednesday into the couple's deaths that before he died, Carl had told her he was going to implicate Mr Dale in 'murder matters'.

Ms Williams denied making quotes attributed to her in The Australian newspaper that suggested her husband had lied about Mr Dale's involvement to reduce his prison sentence.

She said she never thought he would make things up.

'I don't believe that Carl would sit there and tell lies,' she told the Victorian Coroners Court.

During a heated exchange with Mr Dale's barrister Geoff Steward, Ms Williams said her former husband's crimes did not make him a bad person.

'Carl was a loving, caring, family man that adored my three children,' she said.

A witness, who cannot be named, told the inquest that Williams told him that he had organised for Mr Hodson to be killed.

'He (Williams) said "I ordered the hit for Paul Dale",' the witness told the inquest.

Both Mr Dale and Collins deny any involvement in the Hodsons' deaths.

The witness said Williams had paid Mr Dale, who was then a drug squad detective, for information on police investigations.

He said Williams was too 'shy' to find a second police source.

'Carl wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. He only had one source,' the witness said.

The inquest was told that Williams once tried to source a rocket launcher so he could kill Jason Moran and blow up his house.

Moran was gunned down in front of children at a football clinic in 2003 during Melbourne's gangland war.

The inquest, before State Coroner Judge Ian Gray, continues.
