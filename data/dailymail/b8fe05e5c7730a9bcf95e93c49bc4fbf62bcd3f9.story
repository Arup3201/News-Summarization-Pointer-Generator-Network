The Labour party is advertising for a £33,000 a year endorsement officer to forge new relationships with celebrities for Ed Miliband.

The Labour leader is hiring the aide to show he is in touch with the people of Britain in the run up to the general election.

A job advert on the Labour party's website says the  candidate will need to 'deliver an effective General Election endorsements programme with specific focus on real people and celebrity endorsements.'

Ed Miliband is advertising for a £33,000 a year endorsement officer to forge new relationships with celebrities. He is pictured here with Towie star Joey Essex at a party last December, which the reality star tweeted

The Sun reports that party chiefs hope the new employee will rekindle Tony Blair's 'Cool Britannia' and show Mr Miliband is 'in touch' with the public following a number of embarrassing photo opportunities.

But Conservative vice-chairman Bob Neill told the paper: 'Poor Ed is so desperate for support he's now paying someone to find him friends.' 

In October Mr Miliband was pictured chatting with EastEnders' star Danny Dyer, rattling off detailed facts about the cast of the show.

But he soon admitted he had not watched the show but had been reading about it online, leaving the actor bewildered.

Then in November former Hear’Say singer Mylene Klass took the Labour leader to task in a heated TV debate, with viewers praising her for ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with him.

Mr Miliband said the photo opportunity is ‘not where my talents lie' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich

In April Essex took a second picture of himself with Mr Miliband and posted it on Twitter with the group shot, labelled ‘My selfie buddies’ - but the Labour leader appears awkward and only just made the photo

The pair clashed on ITV’s The Agenda, when Ms Klass criticised Mr Miliband’s controversial proposal for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million. 

The Labour leader has said previously that the photo opportunity is ‘not where my talents lie' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich.

He has also been mocked for posing wearing a feminist t-shirt and awkwardly giving money to a beggar in Manchester.  

In a boost for Mr Miliband in December last year Joey Essex took a selfie with the Labour leader at the British Military Awards and referred to the would-be prime minister as his ‘bezzie’, slang for best friend.

Tory MP Bob Neill said: 'Poor Ed is so desperate for support he's now paying someone to find him friends'

The 24-year-old, who tweets about vitally important matters such as having a bad hair day, has 2.98 million followers on Twitter. Mr Miliband has 365,000.

In April Essex took a second picture of himself with Mr Miliband and posted it on Twitter with the group shot, labelled ‘My selfie buddies’. 

A Labour party source told The Sun: 'Labour, like all political parties, works with well-known figures who support our aims.'
