A girl who once suffered panic attacks whenever she left her home has conquered her fears to become a beauty queen.

Chantelle Parker, 23, from Chesterfield, developed agoraphobia when she was 19 years old and suffered severe panic attacks and anxiety when she went outside.

The former Peaks College student became so terrified of the outside world she was unable to even walk to her local newsagent or shopping centre.

When she couldn't find work after college she stayed at home 'because I didn't really have much to get up for'

But after four years of isolation Chantelle finally faced up to her fears after spotting an advertisement for Miss Great Britain.

Chantelle said: 'After I finished college I was at home a lot more often because I didn't really have much to get up for.

'I was looking for a job and had decided against going to university but when I couldn't find work I started staying in the house most days and would rarely go out.

'I remember one day I went out to take my dog for a walk and this wave of panic came over me, I actually thought I was dying because I couldn't breathe.

'After that I would associate places I went as the causes of the panic attacks so would avoid them.

'But the places I could go became so narrowed that in the end I would just stay in my house where I knew I was safe.'

Chantelle was fine until she developed a fear of leaving the house at 19, but faced up to it after four years

Chantelle became a recluse, excusing herself from family events and refusing friend's plans as she was too afraid to leave her home.

It wasn't until she broke down crying to her mother that she sought help for the phobia that was ruling her life.

She said: 
'I felt so isolated and I was even losing friends because every time 
they asked me to do something I would just make up an excuse.

Agoraphobia is an intense fear of being in public places where you feel escape might be difficult.

Sufferers tend to avoid public places, and may not even venture out from home.

The phobia tends to arise as a result of associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them.

'It had got to the point where when my family went out for a meal I'd make excuses and have beans on toast at home.

'One day I just broke down in tears to my mum and told her how I was feeling.

'She told me I couldn't go on like this and that I was like a prisoner in my own home, which I was.

'I went to the doctors but they just told me it was something that would pass and sent me away.'

But as the months passed Chantelle's mental health worsened and she was referred to an anxiety group for help.

It
 was there, with the help of her mother Donna and Anxiety UK, that she learnt
 how to control her panic attacks with breathing techniques.

While
 recovering, Chantelle spotted a Facebook advertisement for 
Miss Great Britain and, although she was still struggling with her phobia,
 she decided to enter.

Chantelle
 said: 'My mum was really worried because she didn't want it to knock my
 confidence while I was still getting better but I knew I wanted to do 
it.

After getting used to being in the house, when she took the dog for a walk she had a panic attack

'I sent off my picture and got through to the telephone audition round, where I spoke about my personality and life.

'Surprisingly they told me I had got through to the final stages and invited me down to Leicester.

Chantelle was competing for the title of Miss Nottingham and was up against 10 other hopefuls.

Despite still being afraid Chantelle knew that to compete she would need to face her fears and tackle her phobia head-on.

She said: 'I knew that I needed to go out shopping and get a dress, have my nails done and get ready for the pageant.

'It was terrifying though as the last time I had stepped foot in a shopping centre I had had a panic attack.

'But I knew I wouldn't be able to compete if I didn't get over my fear.

Although Chantelle did suffer a panic attack, she was able to calm herself down using the breathing techniques she'd been taught and continue her trip - something that she had never before been able to do.

Pageant was last week and Chantelle narrowly missed out on becoming Miss Nottingham

The beauty queen hopeful said: 'I was so proud of myself when it passed because I then knew that I would be okay.

'I just kept telling myself while it was happening that â€˜you can't compete if you can't do this, get over it' and I did.

The Miss Great Britain pageant was held last week on August 7 at the Athena in Leicester and Chantelle narrowly missed out on being named Miss Nottingham in the semi-finals of the competition, the so-called regional heats.

But for the former recluse the competition was about much more than winning as she has been able to get her life back on track.

'The competition gave me my confidence back and an aim to get up every day and head for.

'It wasn't about winning for me it was to show people that you don't have to look a certain way to suffer with a mental health issue and that people need to get rid of the stigma that surrounds mental health.'
