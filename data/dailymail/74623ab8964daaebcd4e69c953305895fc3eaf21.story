A talented gymnast died after suffering 'incredibly rare' blood clots brought on by a combination of Crohn's disease and a contraceptive pill she was taking.

Katie Davies died on Boxing Day 2012, four days after being admitted to Wigan Infirmary.

The 21-year-old Business student thought she was suffering from norovirus shortly before she was rushed to hospital.

Boton Coroner's court heard that Ms Davies, from Appley Bridge, Lancs had been suffering from Crohn's disease and had earlier refused surgical treatment for the painful inflammatory bowel condition.

Instead, Ms Davies opted for a series of injections.

The inquest heard that business student was admitted to Wigan Infirmary on December 22, 2012 after complaining of severe headaches and vomiting.

Scans performed at the hospital discovered that she was suffering from thrombosis and was prescribed anti-coagulation medication. Medics decided that she should also be kept under observation.

However, her condition continued to deteriorate and she died in the early hours of Boxing Day.

The inquest heard that Ms Davies suffered from Crohn's disease and took the oral contraceptive pill which increased the chance of her suffering a blood clot

Area Coroner for Manchester West, Alan 
Walsh, found Katie's death by a cerebral thrombosis arose from a 
combination of her condition and an oral contraceptive she was taking, 
which combined can increase the risk of blood clotting.

Professor David Sanders, from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, told the inquest there was an increased risk of clotting from the combination of Crohn’s disease and the medication she was taking, but for the clots to develop in the brain from such circumstances was incredibly rare.

Deborah Davies told the five-day inquest that her daughter had been looking forward to Christmas before falling ill and refused to let her illness inhibit her love of life.

Ms Davies said: 'She was very glamorous and loved make-up and concerts, there was no keeping her down. She was also a British standard gymnast.

'When she was diagnosed with Crohn’s she was horrified at the thought of the surgery, and she was so keen to try the alternative treatment as it would give her a better quality of life.

'Just before Christmas she said she was too tired to take her brother to the cinema, and that worried us as it just wasn’t Katie. She went to the Trafford Centre and I was told she had been taken to hospital, but she thought it was norovirus and said not to worry.'

The inquest heard that the hospital was extremely busy in Christmas Day with up to 30 patients on each of the unit's five wards. Just three doctors were responsible for the patients.

Dr Zinnarah Zainodin told the inquest she visited Ms Davies twice during the day to carry out a full neurological examination, being unable to do so the first time due to the amount of pain she was in.

However, Dr Zainodin also admitted not fully checking which drugs she was being given.

The court heard how subsequent reviews led to the identification of failings in care, although these did not contribute directly to Ms Davies' death.

The problems identified in treating Ms Davies included the quality of both medical and nursing care and staff knowledge of the seriousness of her condition.

Mr Walsh said he would write to Health Minister Jeremy Hunt about guidelines for treating thrombosis patients and the bleeper system used to call doctors, as this repeatedly failed to bring aid to Katie.

The inquest heard patients suffering from conditions such as Ms Davies' were no longer treated at Wigan but were directly transferred to the regional centre at Salford Royal Hospital for specialist care.

Bolton Coroner's court heard that in the 24 hours before she died there were at least 30 patients on each of Wigan Infirmary's five wards (pictured), covered by just three doctors

Mr Walsh said: 'Katie’s death was such a shock to the hospitals that actions have been taken and Wigan’s changes are ongoing.

'I’m grateful to Salford Royal, as doctors there have devised new guidance for the treatment of patients with this kind of thrombosis.

'I am extremely concerned these are not being followed in some areas, and I will request a review of the policy nationwide.'

Mr Walsh added: 'Katie was an attractive, vibrant young lady who was on the verge of an academic qualification and who had everything to live for.

'She was very close to her boyfriend and had a supportive family. She was clearly bright and intelligent, and everything in her life was there to look forward to in the future. I am greatly saddened Katie is no longer with us and with her family.'

Speaking after her daughter's inquest Mrs Davies said: 'The hospital have really gone out of their way to admit what went wrong and lots of things have now been changed.

'The only thing I can never forget is that Katie died alone and I wasn't able to hold her hand, because I would never have left her side.'
