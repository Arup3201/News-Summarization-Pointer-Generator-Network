A boy racer who killed his 19-year-old girlfriend while driving at 'ludicrous' speeds was jailed for six years today.

Reckless Paul Reddan, 21, was racing another car when he lost control of his silver Vauxhall Corsa SRi at 70mph in a 50mph zone, hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall.

The car burst into flames and Leanne Davies, a trainee hairdresser who was in the front passenger seat, died at the scene from severe head injuries.

Leanne Davies, a trainee hairdresser, had sneaked away from her parents on the night of the fatal tragedy because they disapproved of her on-and-off relationship with her boyfriend Paul Reddan, an engineer

A number of witnesses said Paul Reddan had been driving on the wrong side of the road while he had been allegedly racing with Matthew Creed on a stretch of road for at least two miles before the fatal crash

Reddan, an engineer, was found guilty of death by dangerous driving and jailed for six years and banned from driving for five years at Gloucester Crown Court today.

Sentencing, Judge Jamie Tabor said: 'Leanne was by all accounts a lovely young girl.

'She had the world before her – then her life was taken away by this absolutely ludicrous driving.'

He told Reddan, who turned 21 today: 'I have no doubt at all that you were racing that night. From the moment you got in the car you were driving too fast.

'You were racing in such a way that one witness thought someone would get killed.

'You had been racing for a very long part of your journey in a very dangerous manner. You lost control of your vehicle and you killed Leanne – that is the long and short of it.'

The court heard how Leanne, of Lydbrook, Glos., secretly met up with Reddan on the night of May 31 last year because her parents did not approve of their on-off relationship.

She told them she was going to meet her grandmother, but actually went for food at McDonald's with Reddan before getting into his car at around 9pm.

But while travelling along the A4136 near Longhope, Glos., he lost control on a bend, hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall.

Matthew Creed, 19, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving in the six-day trial which ended today

It was alleged he was racing Matthew Creed, 19, who was also charged with causing death by dangerous driving but was cleared after a six-day trial.

A number of witnesses described how Reddan's Corsa had been very close to Mr Creed's Renault Clio and at one point it was even being driven on the wrong side of the road.

The prosecution alleged that the two men had been racing each other for at least two miles before the fatal crash which left Reddan hospitalised for three weeks.

One witness, Andrew Barnes, who saw the two cars flash past less than a car length apart, only a few hundred metres before the collision, said 'someone is going to die', the court heard.

Leanne's parents, Paul and Heather, said their whole family had been affected by the loss of the hairdresser

An examination of Reddan's car following the incident showed the speedometer stuck at 60mph, the back tyres under-inflated and a defect in the brake pipe.

It was concluded that the car's faults, in combination with the 'manner of driving', could have caused the vehicle to become unstable.

In a victim impact statement read in court, Leanne's father Paul Davies said: 'The hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family.

'We recently attended a family wedding and I could not stop thinking about the fact I will never get to walk my only daughter down the aisle.

Father Paul Davies said in a victim impact statement read in court today that the 'the hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family' and that he was 'angry' over the loss

'Whatever the outcome of this case and whatever the sentence, Paul will always have his life and future, but Leanne will never have that.'

Mr Davies said the loss of his daughter had affected 'every single aspect of my life' and he was angry he would never be able to walk her down the aisle for her wedding one day.

His two sons Luke and Mitch had been badly affected, too and the whole family had received counselling and support, he said.

'The biggest surprise after this incident is that there has been absolutely no remorse shown by Paul Reddan whatsoever.

'We received one letter from him but he didn't even say he was sorry. He did say 'I am sorry you lost Leanne' but there was no hint of sorrow or regret about what had happened.

'It appears to have had no effect on him whatsoever.'

Heather Davies, Leanne's mother, said: 'At just 19 she had her whole life ahead of her. Her dreams and ambitions will now be unfulfilled because of the events of that night.'

She said Leanne had an argument with her dad that night about a forthcoming family holiday and whether Reddan would be joining them because of the on-off nature of their relationship at that time

Mr Davies had regretted the row ever since because it had been the last time he saw his daughter.

The couple were asleep on the sofa in front of the TV at midnight when police arrived to tell them Leanne had been killed, said Mrs Davies.

'I will never be able to forgive Paul Reddan for what happened that night,' she said.

'My only hope is that one day life will become easier and I can remember Leanne for who she was: my beautiful loving daughter.'

Jason Coulter, acting for Reddan, said he had led an honest and industrious life and had no previous convictions - and was never likely to offend again.

He accepted, however, that not long before the tragedy Reddan had been driving at 120mph, when a passenger took a picture of his speedometer.

Mr Coulter said that although Reddan had not appeared remorseful in public his mother had seen him in tears at home and he 'very much mourns the passing of Leanne.'

The solicitor also handed the judge a letter written by Reddan expressing his sorrow.

Reddan had worked for his employers for two and a half years, had completed an engineering apprenticeship, and was earning £25,000 as a buyer of equipment for industrial pipework, he added.

The court heard that the back tyres of Reddan's Corsa were under-inflated and there was a defect in the brake pipe and, in combination with the 'manner of driving', could have caused the vehicle to become unstable

Reddan, of Broadwell, Glos., had passed his test in January 2012 and had got the 1.8 litre car less than three months before the smash, the court heard.

Passing sentence Judge Tabor told Reddan he had not seen any remorse from him and he had 'cut an arrogant figure in the witness box' showing a lack of sensitivity to Leanne's parents.

The judge said he was satisfied Reddan had been 'racing for a very prolonged period in a very dangerous manner.'

Reddan was told he will have to take an extended test before driving again and he will have to pay a £120 surcharge in addition to the jail term and ban.

Leanne's family released a statement after today's sentencing in which they said 'We, the family of Leanne Davies, welcome the verdict handed down by the court today.

'We wish to thank the court, Mr Tully and his team at the CPS, and the police for their meticulous investigation into the truth of what happened that tragic evening.

'Our lives have been on hold since that night, whilst Mr Reddan has been able to carry on with his, showing no remorse whatsoever for his actions.

'We hope that with this trial now over we can start to move on with our lives and focus on our many fond memories of Leanne.

'And finally we would like to thank all of our friends and family for their continued support.'

The officer in charge of the case, PC Tim Griffiths, said: 'It is nearly 18 months since the collision and during that time the family of Leanne Davies have been supported by one of the Constabulary's Family Liaison Officers.

'Leanne's family have remained dignified throughout the investigation and court process.

'It has been a long, painstaking investigation which has been reliant on the local community from Longhope and across the Forest of Dean who have supported our investigation.

'During this period my thoughts have remained with the family whilst focused on establishing one thing, what happened to Leanne.

'I remember one thing, a promise that I made to them: on behalf of the investigation team, that we would do our utmost to find out what happened to their daughter.

'This investigation and trial I hope has done just that, and though they will never ever get over the loss of their much loved and well-liked daughter, I hope that in some small way it helps them to move forward in their lives and to put this terrible tragedy behind them.

'My thoughts and condolences are with all of Leanne's family and friends at this very difficult time.

'The investigation team and I take no pleasure in this guilty conviction, as clearly we would prefer never to have had to conduct this investigation into what is clearly a very sad matter.

'It serves as a reminder to us all that cars, particularly when they are driven in such a manner, are killers in the wrong hands.

'Therefore, we must all strive to not only continue to improve the way in which we drive every day, but also accept the responsibility that we all have when we take to the road.

He added: 'During the course of this trial this young man has not taken responsibility for his actions or the part he played in Leanne's death.'
