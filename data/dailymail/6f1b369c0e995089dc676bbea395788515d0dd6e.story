An American Idol reject whose lullaby made her a viral sensation has revealed online she almost aborted her baby - and in the process started a new viral moment of parents sharing photos of their children that almost never existed.

Kimberly Henderson, 26, from Sunter, South Carolina, filmed herself singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her one-year-old daughter, Vaida, last December.

The clip - which has since been viewed more than four million times - landed the full-time nurse an opportunity to record her own track and since then her phone has apparently been ringing off the hook.

The single mother-of-four who was rejected by American Idol three times has revealed the baby she sang to in the video clip almost never existed after she considered an abortion

But now the single mother-of-four who was rejected by American Idol three times, has revealed the baby she sang to in the video clip almost never existed after she considered an abortion.

In a Facebook post, Henderson, who works as a full time nurse, explains that two years ago this week she had booked an appointment at an abortion clinic, but sat there for seven hours crying as she tried to make her decision.

She then re-posted her post from that day, writing: 'I had my mind made up. My boyfriend was cheating on me. I have small kids, what will people think?? I kept telling myself I'm all alone I need to do this. Sitting there.. I could hardly make out anyone or anything through the tears. 

'People were eating fast food around me, laughing, texting. I on the other hand was a wreck. I kept my face down, my face was drenched in tears.

'I kept telling and giving myself every reason to go through with this even though I did not believe in it. 

'I kept saying I'm on birth control this could not happen.I kept trying to justify it. But my heart was heavy. I felt like I was about to make a horrible horrible decision.

'My once tiny 6lb baby is now 18lbs. Full of life. Full of energy. Loves to laugh. Loves to smile,' she writes

She says she had a difficult morning getting to the clinic as she had to find a babysitter because her daughter was ill, her car broke down on the drive and she arrived for her appointment late - and then she began to wonder if 'God was giving me signs to not do it.' 

Henderson explains that when she was called for her appointment she was looking in her wallet for her ID when a card fell out out - it had been left on a table by a couple she had served that week and had their church name on it.

She says a verse from the bible which was written on the card gave her strength and then two of her best friends called and said they would support her. 

She writes: 'I told the lady I changed my mind. As I was about to walk out. A young girl no older than probably 19 says to me.."Are you going to do it?" I told her I couldn't.. She said.."I wish I could be brave like you.." I told her she was brave and she could do the same thing. 

'She said she had to do it because of some serious circumstances.. As I turned around she said.."When you see your baby's face for the first time you're gonna be so glad you walked out of here today."

She says that when she left the clinic she felt an 'enormous amount of relief and strength.'

Henderson said she had a scary pregnancy and admits to suffering weak moments but gave birth in September 2013.

'I welcomed my beautiful Vaida Everly into this world with both my best friends by my side. I remember seeing her for the first time and bursting into tears,' she writes.

'6lbs 4oz of pure perfection and no matter what pain I felt physically and emotionally... She gave me a feeling of joy that I can't even explain. A kind of joy that if a war was going on outside I wouldn't even know it. I am so in love. My once tiny 6lb baby is now 18lbs. Full of life. Full of energy. Loves to laugh. Loves to smile.'

Henderson explained that the reason she is telling the story to her fans is that Vaida is the baby she was singing to in her video which went viral. 

'The video that has touched millions of people all over the world,' she writes.

'Singing to her in our kitchen for a memory keep sake is the reason our entire life is about to change. For the good. For the better. She was meant to be here. I'm so lucky.'

Her post has inspired hundreds of woman across the world to post photos of their children who they almost aborted.

Their reasons vary - one mother posted a photo of a smiling little girl and wrote alongside it: 'I almost had an abortion also because I got pregnant from a rape and was single with three small boys. So glad I didn't because she is my only baby girl.'

Another posted a photo of herself standing next to her son in a prom outfit and wrote: 'This is my best decision ever as well!!! I was so scared and already had a little one. I went too...and couldn't follow through. He is now almost 17 and my very best friend!'

A mother of six posted a photo of her and her children and wrote: 'I walked out of planned parenthood at 18. I was scared and alone and it seemed like the right thing at the time.

'We got married and had a handsome baby boy and a bunch more like him! He will be 16 this year and we will be married 16 years! He's the young man standing next to me! Such a joy!!! Beautiful story!'

Another mother posted a photo of a girl in a wedding gown marrying a military officer and wrote: 'My beautiful choice on her wedding day. Thank you for being brave enough to share your story!' 

She says she barely gets time to stop but recently she took time out to go and record her own high-gloss music track in Los Angeles called Tiny Hearts

Henderson's song Tiny Hearts is currently at number five in the iTunes chart.

She told Fox News that she is being courted by four different record companies and she is working with a manager to negotiate a deal.

She says she has been singing since the age of two and doing it full-time would be a dream come true.

Currently Henderson  works two jobs as a healthcare worker and receives help from relatives with child care.

She says she barely gets time to stop but recently she took time out to go and record her own high-gloss music track in Los Angeles.

The beautiful ballad, which she penned in just 24 hours, focuses on her her experiences as a single parent.

The first verse describes her earliest months as a young mother to her baby girl.

'My friends are doing normal things like going to the movies and on dates and out on the weekends. And I’m at home,' she explains. 

'I felt like I was missing out on something, but coming home to her and being with her gave my life more meaning.' 

The music-making trip of a lifetime was paid for by Cosco Kids, a company which makes baby products. 

Tiny Hearts was released in January and it is jumping up the charts

Apparently the firm found out Henderson was in a bad car crash and a Cosco car seat saved her child’s life. Managers from the business then came up with a way to support her musical endeavors.

Tiny Hearts was released in January and it has jumped up the charts.

An accompanying music video captured Henderson in action with her children and singing at a recording studio.

Candid footage also showed her getting a makeover with a stylist and make-up artist injecting some added star appeal.

Henderson says getting rejected from American Idol will not stop her from doing what she loves.

She concluded: 'They have good things to say. They just said, "You have a really unique voice, we think you’re good, but it’s just not your time yet."

'So I’m guessing maybe now it’s my time.'

On a more personal level, Henderson hopes that fame might help her to reconnect her with her own mother, who disappeared from her life when she was 11 years old.

'I don't know where she is,' the singer told The Huffington Post, adding, 'But I keep thinking that maybe if she somehow sees my video or my new song, she'll come forward and try to reach out.' 

Henderson says her family are excited about her recent breakthrough. 

Along with Whitney Houston and Sam Smith, Christina Aguilera is another of the blonde's musical idols.
