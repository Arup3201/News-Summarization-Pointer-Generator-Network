Labour MP Keith Vaz appears not to have a care in the world as he joins belly dancers on the dancefloor.

Hours after being forced to answer questions about a police inquiry into £500,000 which appeared in his bank account a decade ago, the Leicester East MP was throwing shapes at the Diversity Night he hosts every year at the Labour party conference.

Despite being referred to the parliamentary standards commissioner, Mr Vaz was also joined by Labour’s power couple: Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper.

Mr Vaz seemed to enjoy being the centre of attention

Mr Vaz is a renowned networker and the Diversity Night has become a staple on the party conference calendar.

The threat of a fresh inquiry into his financial affairs did not seem to dampen his enthusiasm for a night on the tiles.

It came after it emerged a Scotland Yard document suggested Mr Vaz received 'significant amounts of cash' of a 'suspicious nature' between 1997 and 2001.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen yesterday wrote to John Lyons, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner to demand an inquiry and called for Mr Vaz to stand down as chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee.

The inquiry was linked to Mr Vaz’s alleged involvement in trying to obtain British passports for the Billionaire tycoon Hinduja brothers in 2001.

The scandal lead to his resignation as a government minister on health grounds.

At the time the police investigated whether Mr Vaz had received any unexplained payments.

The Daily Telegraph reported that a police report stated at the time: ‘We believe that the level of funds received during 1998 are of a suspicious nature.

‘There are numerous unexplained payments into the accounts and large transfers between accounts that require further investigation.’

But in a statement yesterday, Mr Vaz said the payments 'were not suspicious in any way'.

He added: 'They relate to the sale of a family home in London, the purchase of a new family home and a drawdown of equity from my bank.

'When you sell a house and you buy a new house it is normal practice for the money to be paid into your account and the money then paid out.’

Scotland Yard refused to comment on the leaked documents.
