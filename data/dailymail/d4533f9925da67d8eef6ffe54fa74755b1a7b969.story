The wife of Michael Schumacher is reportedly spending £10million on building a fully equipped medical suite in their family home so her husband can leave the hospital.

Even though Corinna Schumacher, 45, has been told by doctors it is highly unlikely the racing ace will ever wake up from his medically induced coma, she has decided to use the family's £500million fortune to build the facility in their lavish £25million estate on the banks of Lake Geneva, Switzerland.

Today is the three month anniversary of the Alps skiing accident where the seven-time F1 champion, 45, hit his head and was put into an induced coma to reduce brain swelling.

Since then, there have been few encouraging signs of recovery and the racing ace has been wasting away in his hospital bed, losing 25 per cent of his body mass to now only weigh 8st 7lbs.

A friend of the Schumacher's, who has known the family for 25 years The Sun said: 'Miracles happen, of course, and as a wealthy man he has the best care money can buy.

'But all the money in the world cannot fix what has happened to him. The family are making arrangements for a future of permanent immobility.

'Is there a sense of denial at play among them? I would say yes'

The family's life has been taken over by the accident, every day they make the 150-mile round trip from their home in Switzerland to the Grenoble University Hospital, France, where Schumacher is receiving the best possible care.

They spend up to ten hours by his bedside, offering up prayers for his recovery, before returning home in the evening.

Mrs Schumacher has always been a devoted wife, extremely supportive of her husband's career.

Mr Schumacher once said: 'It is not so easy to find a partner who unconditionally adapts to the pace of my life.'

Both growing up in the same region of West Germany, Michael and Corinna Schumacher met at a party in 1991 and fell in love. The pact that has seen their loving relationship endure is that she allows him pursue his high-octane career and, in return, he would give her everything she could want.

With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years.  This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.

He used the staggering fortunes from his 22-year career to snap up a ranch in Texas, where Corinna raises horses, as well as apartments and ski chalets around the world - including the one in Meribel from which he set out on the tragic day late last year.

He even built the estate on Lake Geneva where the new medical facility will be installed.

As a result, Mrs Schumacher refuses to give up on the man she once described as the 'perfect partner'.

The family friend told The Sun she 'would view breaking faith with the hope of a miracle a betrayal, little better than treachery.

'She feels that the family communes around his bedside pulsate their hope and love to him, and that of the millions of fans worldwide who share that faith.

'She can’t express defeat because that would be the end of her.'
