An investigation by animal rights activists has uncovered abuses in the production of 'cat poo coffee', as the demand for the delicacy rises in Australia.

Animal coffee, or kopi luvac, is the world's most expensive coffee, created by feeding cat-like creatures - civits - coffee berries that are extracted after passing through the creature's digestive system and excreted.

The production of civit coffee has grown to commercial proportions in the Philippines and Indonesia, sparking concerns by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) that civits are being force fed to meet demands.

An investigation by animal rights activists have uncovered abuses in the production of 'cat poo coffee', as the demand for the delicacy rises in Australia.

Animal coffee, or kopi luvac, is the world's most expensive coffee, and can be sold for up to $50 per cup

The beans are created by feeding cat-like creatures civits coffee berries that are extracted after passing through the creature's digestive system and excreted.

The growing popularity of the tea in Australia and other countries has been linked to the increase in 'asian palm civet farms', reported Perth Now.

The small creatures are allegedly being held in dirty cages and made to eat the coffee berries in proportions much higher than naturally observed, resulting in abuse of the civits.

PETA has released undercover video footage which shows the condition of civits in confinement, in which the creatures show behaviour consistent with distress such as bar-biting, head-bobbing and spinning in their cages.

A spokeswoman from PETA, Claire Fryer, said that drinkers of the coffee should be concerned about the production methods used to extract the beans.

'It would be nearly impossible to sustain a viable (kopi luwak) enterprise by collecting the beans from civet faeces in the wild,' Ms Fryer said.

'We know some of the beans are still being marketed as “wild sourced” but that is unlikely to be the case.'

PETA investigators allege that they discovered whole villages in Indonesia and the Philippines involved in unregulated production of Asian palm civets.

'One farmer explained that generally the civets are kept for a maximum of three years then released back into the wild but many would not survive,' Ms Fryer said.

'They’re suffering a lot for a cup of coffee.'

Cafe's in Australia are continuing to serve the coffee, despite the concerns raised by PETA.

The Heritage Tea Rooms in Townsville count the delicacy as one of the most popular items on the menu, and are reportedly looking to keep it there.  

Tea Rooms owner Michelle Sharpe said that the business had made sure the beans were being produced ethically.

'It's wild beans,' she said.

'We've verified that. (PETA) can go and check out the plantation.'

'We have nothing to be concerned about.'

However Ms Fryer said PETA found that coffee farmers were seeking to produce the most amount of coffee in the cheapest way possible.  

'That involves keeping civets in cages and feeding them a steady diet of coffee berries when they would normally eat a variety of things in the wild. It can actually make them very sick.'

Jason Baker, PETA Australia director of campaigns, urged consumers to boycott civet coffee.
