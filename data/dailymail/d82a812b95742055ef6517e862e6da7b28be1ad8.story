Brain surgery has helped women with severe anorexia put on weight for the first time since their illness began, say researchers.

They used a ‘pacemaker’ to stimulate areas of the brain responsible for symptoms of depression, anxiety and obsessive thoughts involved in the eating disorder.

Within nine months half the patients had gained weight and their symptoms had improved, while others had stabilised their weight.

Researchers in Canada used a technique
known as deep brain stimulation (DBS) which has successfully helped 
people suffering from Parkinson’s and chronic pain.

Patients
having DBS are fitted with a neurostimulator, a device similar to a 
heart pacemaker, which is connected to electrodes placed in certain 
parts of the brain.

The 
electrical implant is connected to a small battery under the skin in the
person’s chest or abdomen to generate small electrical signals to 
stimulate the brain.

When switched on, the patient benefits from the blocking of abnormal nerve signals which trigger the disabling symptoms.

The
small study of six patients reported in The Lancet medical journal was 
designed to test safety, but researchers said DBS appeared to be capable
of treating severe anorexia.

In
a commentary, UK experts Professor Janet Treasure and Professor Ulrike 
Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry, said the 
findings were ‘promising’ for patients who had failed on conventional 
treatments.

They said ‘New effective treatments for these patients are sorely needed.

‘The
fact that the procedure was associated in some patients with 
improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,
since such improvements will go some way towards reassuring patients 
that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up 
without making them feel better.’

There are around 90,000 Britons with eating disorders including anorexia, which often start in the early teens.

A record number of 1,600 people - mostly girls and women - were given hospital treatment for anorexia in 2011.

The
parents of Laura Willmott, 18, last month spoke out against the care 
system for failing their daughter who collapsed and died after starving 
herself to barely five stone in weight.

She
had been battling anorexia for five years, but was discharged from 
hospital after 11 days when doctors ruled she was ‘physically fit’ 
without telling her family because she was over 18. She died from a 
heart attack two weeks later.

The new study recruited six women aged between 24 and 57, who had been suffering from anorexia for between four and 37 years.

Researchers based at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify a specific area of the brain previously targeted for DBS in patients with depression.

The target area was given stimulation and three months later, five of the six patients stabilised or gained weight.

After nine months, three patients were maintaining a higher weight than before the treatment started - the longest period of sustained weight gain any had achieved since their illness began.

Around half of the patients also experienced improvements in their mood or reduced obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

Researcher Dr Andres Lozano, a leading neurosurgeon in the field of DBS, said it appeared to have a genuine effect on the illness.

‘The finding of improvements in mood and anxiety in patients who were still underweight is especially striking, in view of the well known poor response of underweight patients to conventional pharmacotherapies or psychotherapies’ he added.
