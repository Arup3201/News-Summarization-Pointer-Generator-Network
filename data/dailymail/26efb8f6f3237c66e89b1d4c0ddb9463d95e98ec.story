A mother-of-four who suffered a horrific reaction to a false widow spider bite says the pain still prevents her from hugging her children. 

Carol Veitch, 45, was bitten more than a year ago. But the agony she is in means giving her five-year-old son Paul a goodbye cuddle before school is impossible. 

While she had no fear of spiders before, she is now too scared to leave the house, and says her newly developed arachnophobia is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Carol Veitch, 45, from Harrogate, suffered a horrific reaction after being bitten by a false widow spider a year ago. She has been left in too much pain to hug her children

Mrs Veitch suffered a horrific reaction to the bite, which caused hundreds of sores to appear all over her body

Two days after the bite her calf and ankle had visibly swollen and she had flu-like symptoms, and then over the following eight weeks sores and swelling developed over her body

Mrs Veitch was cleaning her home in Harrogate, which she shares with husband Richard, 51, when she felt a bite on her ankle.

Unable to find the culprit, or a visible mark, she thought her skin must be becoming irritated by the hot summer weather.

But two days later her calf and ankle had visibly swollen and she was exhibiting flu-like symptoms.

Mrs Veitch said: 'I was coughing and couldn't breathe. I went to the doctor and he told me that I had a chest infection and bronchitis.

'While there I got him to check my leg. I was in a terrible state so they put me on steroids.'

Just days after she first visited her GP in Harrogate, Mrs Veitch found the false widow spider trapped in her bath tub.

She said: 'I took the spider to the doctor and we got it identified by the local environmental health department. The doctor said my symptoms were typical of a false widow bite.'

'The doctor was shocked because none had been sighted in Harrogate at the time - the nearest case had been in Manchester.'

The false widow spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom

False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. 

The chances of being bitten by a false widow are incredibly low, with no more than 10 spider bites being reported each year in the UK, according to animal experts.

Over the following eight weeks Mrs Veitch's condition became worse, with sores and swelling developing across her arms and face.

Despite treatment with medication, the sores are still so painful that direct physical contact leaves her in agony.

Mrs Veitch said: 'I would love to give Paul a cuddle before he heads off to school, but I can't, because my skin is too sore.

'I can't face going swimming with my kids because it looks like I have leprosy. 

'If I was stood next to someone who looked like me I would be terrified.

'I can't go out or show my arms because it's  embarrassing.

'My face has changed because it swelled up so much. I'm completely covered in sores.'

Mrs Veitch had no fear of spiders before she was bitten but is now so scared of them that she is afraid to leave the house.

She said her newly-developed arachnophobia is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder.

She said: 'I can't sleep because I'm terrified one will come into the bedroom. 

'We found a common house spider in the living room last week and I didn't sleep for two nights.

'If I see one on television I'll have a huge panic attack and leave the room crying.'

Mrs Veitch's husband, Richard, 51, has taken time off from his job as a construction foreman to care for his wife.

She said: 'It's had a massive effect on my marriage because I used to be so independent and now I rely on him for so much - but he's been brilliant.'

Mrs Veitch, who has three sons - Pail, five, Nathan, 23, and Jamie, 26, and a daughter named Amber, 15, now attends regular therapy sessions to help her overcome her new-found fear.

She said Paul has also developed arachnophobia due to being traumatised by his mother's illness.

Mrs Veitch said: 'I've terrified him. If he's in the car with his dad and he sees even a tiny spider he will go hysterical.

'I can't even cuddle him to make it better.

'If he see's anything move he'll jump to attention and try to protect me. He's so brave.

'If he sees a creepy-crawly he will yell to me 'don't look' until Richard has moved it away.'

Mrs Veitch said the bites have affected her family. She is now very reliant on her husband and can't hug her children before they go to school

British homes may be set for an invasion of larger than normal spiders who have feasted on an abundance of prey in the last few months, according to experts.

That’s because this year the warm summer has allowed certain spiders to eat more than usual and grow to their upper limits.

And it could mean we’ll see more and more large spiders in our homes in the coming months.

The mild summer has meant the eight-legged creatures have had plenty to eat and very few have perished.

With temperatures set to fall, experts from Sydney University have said the larger-than-usual house spiders will be heading indoors in the coming weeks to find a mate.

Professor Adam Hart, of the University of Gloucestershire, agreed with their predication and said: ‘This year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on, and it’s quite mild out there.’

Both sexes stay in their webs until the autumn when the males become nomadic and search for females.

Mr Lawrence Bee of the British Arachnological Society told MailOnline that people often notice larger spiders this year as the cold weather drives them inside, with males hunting for females.

But he agrees that the particularly mild summer we’ve had, not too hot and not too cold, will have given spiders access to more prey.
