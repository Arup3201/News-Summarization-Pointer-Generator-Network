Petrol and diesel could be replaced by a fuel developed from a bacteria found in the human gut, scientists claim.

Researchers have found a way to use the gut bacteria E.coli - often behind attacks of diarrhoea - to help generate propane gas - a part of petroleum gas. 

The results could one day lead to a new type of fuel that uses solar energy to convert it into a useable form.

Researchers added three enzymes to the bacteria, thioesterase, CAR and aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase.

This allowed them to extract butyric acid, a foul smelling compound essential for propane production.

Dr Patrick Jones, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London, said: 'Although this research is at a very early stage, our proof of concept study provides a method for renewable production of a fuel that previously was only accessible from fossil reserves.

'Although we have only produced tiny amounts so far, the fuel we have produced is ready to be used in an engine straight away.

The results, published in the journal Nature Communications, could one day lead to a new type of fuel for cars that uses solar energy to convert it into a useable form

'This opens up possibilities for future sustainable production of renewable fuels that at first could complement, and thereafter replace fossil fuels like diesel, petrol, natural gas and jet fuel.'

The notion that homes could be fuelled by human waste, might not be an appealing, but it could transform people's lives in developing countries.

British scientists have already proved they can charge a phone by using urine to feed microbial fuel cells.

And they aim to scale up their innovation to provide much needed electricity and sanitation in the form of a clever bathroom system designed to be used in remote and poor areas of the world.

The research is backed by the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation, as the Microsoft billionaire is keen to help to create a fully-functional system that could be installed in bathrooms to collect urine, which would be used to light and heat a house as well as power gadgets.

'Fossil fuels are a finite resource and as our population continues to grow we are going to have to come up with new ways to meet increasing energy demands.

'It is a substantial challenge, however, to develop a renewable process that is low-cost and economically sustainable.

'At the moment algae can be used to make biodiesel, but it is not commercially viable as harvesting and processing requires a lot of energy and money. '

At present scientists believe that they need to find a way to make their process 1000 per cent more efficient.

Dr Jones added: 'We chose propane because it can be separated from the natural process with minimal energy and it will be compatible with the existing infrastructure for easy use.

'At the moment, we don't have a full grasp of exactly how the fuel molecules are made, so we are now trying to find out exactly how this process unfolds.

'I hope that over the next five to 10 years we will be able to achieve commercially viable processes that will sustainably fuel our energy demands.'

The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.

However, the process still needs to be made 1000 per cent more efficient
