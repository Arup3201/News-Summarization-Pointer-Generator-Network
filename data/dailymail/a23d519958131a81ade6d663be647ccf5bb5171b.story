A young woman has been filmed by her friends skolling a full bottle of Jagermeister in just 15 seconds.

Friends of Mary Brown, 19, encouraged her to drink the bottle of German liquor, which is the equivalent of 19 standard drinks, as part of a joke.

The footage, which was uploaded to Facebook and subsequently shared thousands of times earlier this year, has now started doing the rounds again online.

Ms Brown, who lives in Brisbane, was offered a packet of cigarettes by a friend if she successfully drank the bottle of Jagermeister.

She drank the alcohol as part of the Neknominate craze, which encouraged people to post videos of themselves skolling drinks on Facebook and then nominating someone else to do the same.

Her friends started filming as they 'cracked' open the bottle before yelling at her to come outside.

'Oi Mez, come down here. You've been neknominated Mezza. Down it Mez. I'll buy you a back of smokes if you do it,' her friend can be heard yelling. 

The teenager hesitates for a couple of seconds and comments that it's a Sunday before she starts skolling the alcohol. 

Mary later apologised for the video when a few people died from the Neknominate craze.
