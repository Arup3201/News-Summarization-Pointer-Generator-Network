Any moment now there will surely be a press release issued by the Tiger Woods camp in which the man himself reveals an online account was hacked and words purporting to come from him were actually a spoof.

That can be the only rational response to an extraordinary over-reaction from Woods to a low-grade piece of parody in the latest issue of Golf Digest.

In his take on an ‘interview’ in the magazine that makes clear in the headline it is fake and therefore satirical, Woods actually manages to come across as more deranged than the one parodied.

Tiger Woods (right) took exception to a parody of the golf star in the latest issue of Golf Digest magazine 

The article in question was penned by revered American golf writer Dan Jenkins 

Talk about truth being stranger than fiction.

In a blog on a website called The Players’ Tribune, Woods labels the piece a ‘grudge-fuelled piece of character assassination’ and follows it with an amazing statement: ‘Journalistically and ethically, can you sink any lower?’

Talk about losing the plot completely.

Let us emphasise the piece is wholly unfunny, drawing upon tired cliches about Woods — that he has no mates, does not like tipping — and mocks his scandal-ridden past ad nauseam.

But not being very good is the worst charge you can make, given the lengths which the headline goes to stress the interview is not genuine. Ethically, it steps into no grey area whatsoever.

Trouble is, it was written by Dan Jenkins, the most celebrated golf writer in America. Jenkins is 84 and has been to more than 220 major championships. He once failed to name Woods in his all-time top five, which might be why, in Tiger’s world, he suspects a ‘grudge’. But most people would consider it an opinion to which Jenkins is more than entitled.

Golf Digest reacted the only way a proper magazine could to cries from the Woods camp for an apology. They promoted it to become the lead article on their website. 

This could now become the most read piece Jenkins has written for several decades — a shame, given the many brilliant ones he has penned. The vast majority of people, I predict, will get about halfway through and wonder what possessed Woods to react in the way he did.

Or maybe that press release saying his account was hacked is still winging its way through the ether.

Meanwhile, it is back down to Earth — the name of the course that will host the European Tour’s season finale, the DP World Tour Championship, starting on Thursday. The Race to Dubai might be run, but with the tour’s finest all in attendance, there’s no reason why the greatest season in the history of European golf should not get an appropriate send-off.

For a start there are so many among the cast of 60 for whom a win in this event would change the entire complexion of their season.

Ian Poulter plays a shot in the practice round ahead of the forthcoming DP World Tour Championship 

Take Ian Poulter. Right now, he is looking at 2014 the way somebody does a bit of dog poo on the sole of their shoe. But a victory here and he would finish second behind the Race to Dubai winner Rory McIlroy with a seven-figure cheque in his pocket. 

It could happen, too. All those months of pent-up frustration have suddenly been eased by a couple of good tournaments in a row. Who knows what might happen following his conversation with the Australian legend Greg Norman on Tuesday night, about putting technique.

Poulter should have won the Turkish Airlines Open last week, given he led by six shots at one stage. He even missed from 6ft on the final green to force a play-off.

Watching at home, Norman believed he knew why and tweeted as much. Naturally, Poulter followed that up with a phone call and spent much of yesterday on the practice putting green trying to work out if Norman was right.

‘It was really nice of Greg to reach out but I’ve been working hard on my putting and I feel like I’ve made good inroads,’ said Poulter. ‘Obviously a couple of key putts have slipped past but I’d like to review them myself as well as having a great opinion from Greg. So I will let you know what conclusion I reached on Sunday night. How about that?’

Poulter has a good record here, having lost a play-off in 2010 to Robert Karlsson, while he was pipped by another Swede, Henrik Stenson, last year.

The man they will all have to beat, of course, is the one Stenson will accompany on the first tee just after High Noon here today. As Tiger descends beyond parody, we should be ever more thankful for the contrasting example set by his successor as the world’s best player, McIlroy.
