Fulham were handed a harsh reminder of the realities of life in the second tier as goals from Daryl Murphy and David McGoldrick gave Ipswich a comfortable opening day win.

Felix Magath fielded a side unrecognisable from the one that suffered relegation from the Barclays Premier League last season, with captain Scott Parker joined by five academy graduates and five new signings, including £11m man Ross McCormack.

But they will need some time to gel and defensive frailties were exposed here by an Ipswich side who might be an outside bet for the play-off places.

Parker is usually Mr Reliable in the heart of midfield, but he was stripped of possession by Luke Hyam just after the half-hour mark. Hyam slipped Daryl Murphy through the right-hand channel and he breezed past the lightweight Shaun Hutchinson before finishing low past Jesse Joronen.

And Hutchinson was exposed again when he only half-cleared a cross by Murphy on the hour, the ball falling perfectly for Portman Road favourite David McGoldrick, making his first appearance since February, to crash home from outside the box.

Ipswich were excellent value for their lead though they were forced to cling on after Fulham’s Tim Hoogland pulled one back with a deflected effort four minutes from time that beat Dean Gerken at his near post.

A Fulham equaliser would have been undeserved, though Magath know it will take time to readjust to life in the Championship after 13 years at a higher level, especially with such an altered team.

Slow start: Ross McCormack failed to have any real impact as Fulham fell to a defeat in their opening game

His was a bold selection, with great faith shown in the stars of Fulham’s run to the FA Youth Cup final last season. Joronen, Moussa Dembele, Emerson Hyndman and Patrick Roberts were among those named in the squad. Thomas Eisfeld, the 21-year-old German talent signed from Arsenal, was named on the bench.

Joronen, was called into action early on when he pushed Christophe Berra’s goalbound header over the bar after Tyrone Mings had delivered well from the left.

Fulham had a golden chance to take the lead when Dean Gerken spilt a Chris David shot at the feet of Dembele, his rebound blocked by the relieved keeper.

And they would rue that miss when Murphy opened the scoring just after the half-hour, to the delight of the 17,000-plus crowd enjoying the return of regular football on a gloriously sunny August afternoon.

Work to do: There is plenty to think about for Felix Magath and his Fulham team, who need to adapt to this level

McCormack endured a frustrating start to his Fulham career and was replaced before the hour by Cauley Woodrow. He had barely had a sniff, marked out of the game by the Ipswich defenders.

Magath afterwards admitted his expensive acquisition was some was short of the required match fitness.

Almost immediately, Ipswich doubled their lead and the stuffing looked to have been knocked out of Fulham.

To their credit, they rallied, improving massively after the introduction of tyro Roberts, who cut inside from the right to good effect.

But it was Hoogland, the right-back brought in from Schalke over the summer, who actually made that tactic work to set up a grandstand finale.
