They went public with their romance last year and have seen their relationship go from strength-to-strength after moving in with each other a few months ago.

And Dustin Lance Black was every inch the supportive partner as he spurred boyfriend Tom Daley on to win a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Saturday night.

After cheering on the diving champion from his seat at the Royal Commonwealth Pool, the Oscar-winning screenwriter looked proud as punch as the 20-year-old sportsman bagged an impressive score of 516.55 to clinch the top spot.

Proving just how close he is to Tom's family, Dustin sat alongside the gold medal winner's mother Debbie as the pair waved a flag of St George emblazoned with his surname.

Tom spoke about his sexuality for the first time in December 2013 by making a brave decision to post a video on YouTube, where he discussed his preferences.

He said: 'It was a terrifying decision to make, I didn’t know what the reaction was going to be like, I didn’t know how it was going to go but I felt I needed to say something.

Plenty to smile about: Dustin couldn't keep the smile off his face as he saw his partner receive his medal

Round of applause: Dustin and Tom revealed they were a couple late last year and have seen their romance go from strength to strength since then

'I wanted to say something in my own words and from the heart, I didn’t know what else to do.'

Offering advice for his young fans, he added: 'Tell one person. Tell your story, how you feel.

'I’ve had people send some lovely Twitter messages with people telling me they’ve since come out to their parents, that they’ve had some hope, it shouldn’t matter who I’m dating in this day and age. Be who you want to be.'

Support: The diver was also supported by his mother Debbie, pictured above holding up a flag reading 'Daley'

The talented sportsman later opened up on his relationship with Dustin, 39, admitting it was 'love at first sight'.

Speaking on The Jonathan Ross Show in December, he said: 'I’d never felt like anything like it before. We were at a party and I hadn’t even spoken to him all night. I didn’t knOw what to do or if he was gay at first.

'I’d never felt the feeling of love, it happened so quickly, I was completely overwhelmed by it to the point I can’t get him out of my head all the time. I’ve never had it before where I love someone and they love me just as much.'

Another gold: British diving star Tom Daley has won the Commonwealth Games men's 10-metre platform final

Daley's
 margin of victory was a whopping 82.85 as Malaysia's Ooi Tze Liang

Determined: Tom Daley's win took England's overall tally from 10 events to 10 medals, four of them gold

Australia's Matthew 
Mitcham, the 2008 Olympic champion and silver medallist 
behind Daley four years ago, finished fourth with 420.00.

Daley's win took England's tally from 10 events to 10 medals, four of them gold.

The diver said he was 
thrilled with his performance, saying: 'It's 
always tough to go into a competition when you're ahead because when 
you're ahead you've got to make sure you keep your standard up. If you 
slip, someone's going to catch you.

'I
 just had to keep imagining that someone was right on my heels to make 
me step it up. I don't want to go out there and just do average diving. I
 want to do perfect diving.'

Nervous? Daley, pictured waiting his turn to dive, rose to the occasion to clinch another gold on the world stage

He also 
emphatically dismissed rumours that he might retire following his win, 
saying he planned to pursue gold at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016.

Daley a London 2012 bronze medallist, said of his Olympic aim: 'Of course. I don't quite know where that rumour came from.

'I
 came back from (the World Cup event in) Shanghai and all of a sudden I 
saw that I was retiring after the Commonwealths. I was like - "news to 
me".'

Now, Daley has set his sights on taking on the world's best.

Worried: Black, 40, looked nervous as he watched his partner perform at the Royal Commonwealth Pool

'There's
 every possibility that I can mix it with the Chinese now,' he said. 'I 
wouldn't mind if I never beat the Chinese until 2016. You've only got to
 do it once and you've got to do it when it counts.

'Hopefully they'll be able to see that I'm coming to get them.'

Hannah Starling earlier claimed bronze in the women's three-metres springboard.
