Ministers have been accused of risking child safety after leaked documents showed they are ‘scaling back’ efforts to fight pornography and poor parenting.

Michael Gove’s Education Department spends £2.5 billion a year supporting young people and troubled families.

But The Mail on Sunday has seen a top-level internal memo saying work on the internet safety initiative ‘can be scaled back’  just when it is developing plans championed by David Cameron.

'Scaling back': Ministers have been accused of risking child safety after leaked documents showed they were reducing efforts to fight pornography and poor parenting

Sources fear Ministers would halve the number of civil servants supporting the United Kingdom Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), the body set up to protect children from online pornography, bullying, grooming and violent video games.

In December, Mr Cameron backed plans to protect children from harmful online content. Now UKCCIS insiders say cuts would send a ‘poor message’.

One said: ‘There is no doubt this could impact child safety.The plans are costly, so internet providers will resist. Without staff we will no longer have the muscle to follow them through.’

The leaked memo also suggests ‘radical’ reductions in parenting support programmes to help counter poor discipline, an issue linked to 2011’s riots.

Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg said: ‘Mr Cameron promised robust child protection online and support for families but this document exposes the truth – Ministers are planning to scale back this work, despite all the Prime Minister’s promises.’

Department for Education sources said UKCCIS was still working on internet safety, but parts of the project had come to a natural conclusion.

The Department refused to comment on the leak.
