An Islamic cleric has visited the family home of slain terrorist Numan Haider where he said relatives of the 18-year-old are coming to terms with their grief. 

Sheikh Abu Ayman, the director of the Muslim-based Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah Association of Australia - said members of Haider's family wept on his shoulder as he spent time consoling mourning relatives at their Endeavour Hills home, south east of Melbourne, on Thursday.

Mr Abu Ayman said the 18-year-old's parents were being supported by 'Allah' to help them cope with his death two days after he was fatally shot by police officers outside a Victorian police station.

'When you lose your youngest son, it's not a simple thing - especially when you only have three sons,' he said.

Shiekh Abu Ayman visits the house of Numan Haider in Melbourne where he said the family is relying on 'Allah' to cope with its loss

Mourners have been coming and going from the home since the 18-year-old's death on Tuesday

Like the death of any close relative he said the Haider family are feeling a deep sorrow for the loss of Numan.

'I would say Allah give them so much patience to cope with tragedy.

'They cry on my shoulder.'

Sheikh Abu Ayman's words come as distraught relatives have been seen coming and going from the family's home in Melbourne's outer suburbs ever since Haider's death on Tuesday.  

Police fatally shot Numan Haider outside the Endeavour Hills police station where it was arranged they would meet the 18-year-old  after conducting raids on his home Tuesday morning. 

It was agreed that Haider would greet a Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on Tuesday night, however police allege he had other ideas.

Seconds after meeting the 18-year-old he took out a weapon and repeatedly stabbed both officers. 

He was then killed by a single shot.

Sheikh Ayman said on Thursday that he never met Naider but was present at the home to support the family and pay his respects.

He said he felt 'sadness' for both the family of Haider and the officers injured in Tuesday's violent attack.

'With all the sadness in my heart about what happened from either side and I am in the middle,' he said.

'I look at my right I see the sorrow of the two police families being hit in that way.

'I look to me left and see this family losing a young man of theirs, of ours, of Australia.'

Sheikh Ayman said Haider's loss was being felt across the entire Muslim community

Sheikh Ayman said Haider's death was reverberating through the  entire Muslim community.

'As my feeling exactly, sad and sorrow, full of questions without answers.'

Sheikh Ayman also asked the Australian community to band together at this time.

'I hope the media...[is] just in their reports something that unites us and brings us together as Australians,' he said.

'There enough troubles around us [in the world]...we don't have to bring the trouble home.'

Two other women, also strangers of the 18-year-old, said the family were left asking why this had happened Haider.

They said they were there because they were of the same nationality and religion as the slain teenager.

'We came here as a human. If it happens for anyone, we feel sorry for them,' one of the female mourners said.

Two women, who identified as being of the same religious background and nationality of Numan Haider, said they 'felt sorry' for the family

'They're [the family] crying, they're crying and saying "How is it possible my son do it like this?"'

The pair of women also had questions for the authorities.

'He's 18, he's a teenager,' the other woman said.

'I was 18 years old and I did not know a thing. If someone make a mistake you don't shoot him.

'I feel let down because either they're [the police] lying to me for what they're making up or they've really been attacked by an 18-year-old.

'How long have you been trained, you've been trained to protect yourself. If you can't do that - how can I feel safe, how can you feel safe?' 

It is understood Haider had been under investigation by authorities for at least three months, However police acted when they had become concerned about some of his recent activities and rhetoric.
