A Canadian gold-medalist made history this weekend when she played her first game for a professional men's hockey team.

Shannon Szabados, 27, is the first woman to play in the Southern Professional Hockey League after signing on as a goalie for the Columbus, Georgia Cottonmouths.

While the Cottonmouths lost Saturday's game against the Knoxville Ice Bears 4-3, Szabados put on an impressive show saving a total of 27 shots.

First game: Shannon Szabados, 27, is the first female to play in the Southern Professional Hockey League. She played her first game with the Columbus Cottonmouths on Saturday

Gold medalist: Szabados recently helped lead the Canadian women's team to victory at the Olympics

In a post game interview, the Edmonton-native admitted she may have been a little rusty since she hasn't skated in a while.

Saturday's game was one of the few times Szabados' has been on the ice since she helpd defeat the United States women's team in the Olympic finals on February 20, securing her second gold medal with Team Canada.

When asked how her men's professional debut compared to the Olympic-winning game, Szabados said it was 'definitely up there'.

'I’ve been asked a lot whether this or the gold medal game was bigger. I’d have to say the gold medal game but here there was a little more excitement,' Szabados told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer.

Warm up: The Olympian admitted she felt a little rusty after not having practiced in a while. Saturday's game was one of the few times she's been on the ice since her Olympic victory on February 20

Tough enough: Szabados has spent much of her career playing with the boys, from junior league to her time at Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. Above, another shot at Saturday's game

There for her: The 27-year-old says she enjoyed Saturday's game and even saw a few fans in the crows wearing her jersey

Szabados says she had fun at the game, and even saw a few spectators wearing shirts with her name.

Cottonmouths coach Jerome Bechard gave his new goalie's first performance a positive review.

'I thought she played well,' Bechard said. 'She made the stops she was supposed to make.'

Before Saturday's game, Bechard spoke with the New York Times about the new addition to his team and remarked on how it showed the hockey world was changing.

'I guess equal opportunity's the word. In my opinion, if you can play, it doesn't matter what color, what nationality, what gender you are,' Bechard told the Times.

Watching her back: Szabados admits being a girl makes her a target on the ice

Szabados isn't the first female to play men's professional hockey, but she is the first to do so in the 10-year-old SPHL.

Female hockey players have a hard time continuing their sport after college, since currently no women's professional league plays a living wage. 

No woman has ever played a regular-season game in the NHL, though Manon Rheaume played an exhibition game with Tampa Bay in 1992.

Before starting with the Cottonmouths, Szabados practiced with NHL team the Edmonton Oilers when they were short a goalie after a trade.

In fact, Szabados has spent most of her career playing with the boys, from junior league teams to days on the men's team at Northern Alberta Institute of Technology.

And at the age of 16, she became the first women to play in the Western Hockey League.

Despite her  Olympic credentials, Szabados admits her gender is going to make her more of a target.

'I’m sure I’ll get run into quite a bit because that’s part of the men’s game,' Szabados told the Times.

Still, Szabados has earned the respect of her fellow teammates who are excited to playing with a woman at the top of her game.

Forward Matt Gingera, from Winnepeg, says he watched Szabados during the Olympic tournament and often wondered whether he would be able to get the puck past her.

'It’s very cool we get to play with her,' Gingera said. 'Watching her on TV during the Olympics, she’s like a celebrity.'
