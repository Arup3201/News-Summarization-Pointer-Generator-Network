Manchester City and Arsenal are continuing to monitor Cagliari midfielder Godfred Donsah.

The confident 18-year-old has already attracted enquiries from Tottenham last month and can play at centre midfield as a holding player or right-back.

Arsenal and City scouts watched him on Monday against Inter Milan in their 2-1 defeat.

The Ghanaian joined in 2012 from DC United Agogo for £2million.

The president of Cagliari, Thomas Guilini, confirmed: 'It's not just City, even Arsenal were here to see him but I want to keep him here another year. 

'It is better for his development too to stay here one more season.'

Cagliari president Thoma Guilini wanted Donsah to remain with the club for another season before moving
