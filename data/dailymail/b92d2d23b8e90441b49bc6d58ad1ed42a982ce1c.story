Shocking leaked pictures appear to show how Japanese soldiers are trained to resist torture - by having their private parts tied to a tree.

The photographs, which made their way on to the internet this week, apparently show officers from the country's Self-Defense Forces undergoing a series painful training exercises.

A number of the images show the military recruits standing naked in a forest - their private parts tied together by a piece of rough rope that is attached to tree trunks on either side.

Another image appears to show an officer smiling as he leans towards a naked recruit with a lit match. The exercises are thought to be part of training for how to withstand brutal torture and interrogation techniques

The men look battered and bruised after being tied together with rough rope looped around their necks and torsos. Japanese military have offered no comment on the pictures

In another, an officer, who appears to be more senior, smiles as he stands next to one of the naked recruits with a lit match in his hand.

Some of the officers appear to be laughing as they subject the naked recruits to the brutal tests.

It is understood that the men are being put through the 'Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape' programme, known as SERE, which provides military personnel with training in evading capture and survival skills.

Part of the programme is thought to simulate the harsh interrogation and torture techniques that they could face if captured by enemy forces.

The images have prompted a heated debate in Japan, where the military has provided no official comment on the pictures.Their authenticity has yet to be confirmed.

Social media commentators widely criticised the images, saying it appeared to be an amateur operation - and an example of a waste of public money.

This picture appears to show the senior officers laughing as they subject the recruits to the degrading and painful exercises. The pictures have been met with heavy criticism in Japan

The Japanese Self Defence Force was formed from the unified military forces of Japan that were established after the end of the post-Second World War Allied occupation of the country.

And though its activities were confined to the Japanese islands until recently, officers have engaged in international peacekeeping operations.

It is believed to have stepped up activities in the face of tension with China, especially regarding the dispute over control of the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.
