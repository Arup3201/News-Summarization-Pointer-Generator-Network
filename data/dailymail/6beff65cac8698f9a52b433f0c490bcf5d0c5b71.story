A family that joked their house was haunted after they started hearing noises were shocked to find a deadly 10ft python that had been slithering around their home for a week.

Rachel Leck and her son Xavier, 10, joked that creepy occurrences, such as a lamp being knocked over and glasses falling to the floor, were caused by a mischievous poltergeist.

But as they sat down to watch a baseball game on the TV in their house in Midland, Ontario, Canada, on Sunday, Xavier spotted the huge snake draped over the sofa less than a meter from his mother.

The 10ft reticulated python had been living in the family's home for up to two weeks when it was found

'The snake was dangling down and I was about to sit down on the couch,' Xavier said.

Ms Leck added: 'I looked over about the same time he really yelled "there's a snake in the house".'

'I jumped up, grabbed my kid and ran out of the house screaming.'

Ms Leck and Xavier alerted their neighbors, and six of them joined in the search for the missing snake, Simcoe.com reported.

Midland Police and animal control were called to remove the huge reptile, who eventually coaxed him out from under the family's sofa.

Animal control confirmed the snake as a reticulated python - a south-east Asian species which can grow to up to 23ft long.

Rachel Leck said that as soon as she saw the snake, she grabbed her son and 'ran out the house screaming'

Although attacks on humans are rare, reticulated pythons have killed people by strangulation in the past.

Where they live: South-east Asia

Habitat: Forests, woodlands, grasslands, often near waterways

Maximum recorded length: 33ft

Weight: Up to 353lbs

Conservation status: Widespread and locally common

Threats: Habitat loss due to agricultural and urban development. Hunting for meat and skins, and collection for the exotic pet trade 

Ms Leck said the snake could have been there for up to two weeks, and that it explained some strange happenings in the house such as furniture falling over and crockery smashing.

'We were joking that we had a ghost,' she said.

'I'm a bit creeped out by it,'

'I just see a big snake in my living room and I think I could be in danger…. It could be a cobra for all I know about snakes.'

Inspector Ron Wheeldon said it was illegal to keep exotic pets in Midland and that 22-year-old man had been charged.

Insp Wheeldon refused to identify the man, but said he lived about one-and-a-half blocks away from Ms Leck's home.

The man could be fined up to $100.

The python will be re-homed in a local zoo, an animal control officer said.
