A woman has spoken of the moment she fulfilled her mother’s dying wish – by having breast implants.

Carol Stapleton, 55, from Deal, Kent had dreamt of having breast surgery for more than 40 years.

But her wish only came true after her terminally ill mother told her she must have the operation when she died and pledged to leave her enough cash to cover the £4,000 operation in her will.

Carol Stapleton dreamt of having breast surgery for more than 40 years, the 55-year-old from Deal, Kent was left the money for an operation after her mother passed. She went from a B cup (left) to an E cup (right) 

True to her word, when brush maker Joan died aged 82, she left Carol more than enough to cover surgery to boost her from a B cup to an E cup.

So in August last year - 17 months after her mother’s death, Carol went under the knife.

Carol is convinced her mother has since visited her in spirit to give her new bust her seal of approval.

She believes her new chest is a wonderful way to remember her mother and that the parting gift didn’t just buy her new breasts, but happiness and confidence too.

Carol said: ‘Mum knew how much I wanted surgery but there was always something more important to spend the money on.

‘One day I was moaning about it as usual when she sat me down and told me when she was gone there would be enough money for me to get them done and that she wanted me to have the surgery.'

Carol continued: 'Mum's words to me were: "You’ll not have to worry about no bust when me and your dad pop our clogs."

'It was her way of telling that was how she wanted me to spend my inheritance.

‘Mum was always a very forceful person who liked to be listened to.'

Carol recalls feeling self conscious about her bust from a young age. 

She says: ‘From the age of 15 I wished for bigger boobs, I didn’t feel very feminine and was envious of women with bigger chests. 

'I kept hoping they would grow but they never did.‘

'Mum knew how I felt. In fact, I suspect she probably felt the same but in those days you just got on with it.’

As she grew older Carol always hoped to be able to one day afford surgery but divorced with a young son, she was diagnosed with MS and unable to work.

So instead, she resorted to stuffing her bras and buying padded underwear, but always vowing to one day fund a way to have surgery.

She was turned down for surgery on the NHS despite suffering depression triggered by her body insecurities.

She says: ‘ I felt like a fraud. I looked OK in clothes but under the padding I felt there was nothing, it affected my self esteem terribly.’

Carol’s yearning for implants was no secret to second husband Dennis who she married seven years ago or her son, now aged 25.

Carol said: ‘My whole family knew how much I wanted surgery - I’d been talking about it for years.’

But it was after lifelong smoker Joan was diagnosed with life-limiting emphysema that she sat Carol down and firmly told her what she wanted her to do when she died.

Carol said: ‘Mum was far too practical to offer to pay for it while she was still alive. 

But she didn’t mince her words when she told me I must go ahead when she and dad died.

‘It meant the world to me that not only was she giving me her blessing, but she was actually making it possible.

‘Of course I hoped that wouldn’t be for a long time because I hated the thought of losing my mother, we were very close. 

'But Mum was in poor health, relying on oxygen to get through the day and nobody knew how long she had left, so she wanted me to know her wishes. About that she was clear.’

So with her mother’s blessing, Carol began researching clinics offering breast augmentations and found the Transform cosmetic sugery group.

She said: 'It felt odd researching the operation knowing I wouldn’t be going ahead until Mum and dad both died but Mum had told me what she wanted me to do and I couldn’t deny the inevitable.’

Since going from a B cup to an E cup, Carol is more relaxed about her appearance and feels clothes fit her better 

It was another two years before Joan succumbed to the disease in March 2012, passing away from a chest infection just 24 hours after her former miner husband Sydney died of pneumonia.

Carol said: ‘Mum had fought her condition for so long that I know she died of a broken heart. 

'I was devastated to lose them both and the only comfort I had was that they were together.’

She says she took solace in being able to execute and later carry out her mother’s wishes by forging ahead with plans for surgery.

She said: ‘I did a lot for mum and I missed her terribly. It was a small comfort to know I was doing something she wanted me to do.

‘I imagined her looking down on me and smiling because she had made it possible.’

Carol even claims that when she was taken into theatre at the Transform Hospital in Brentwood, Essex, she felt her mother’s presence.

Carol believes her mother Joan (pictured) would approve of the way her confidence has grown since the operation 

She said: ‘I hadn’t experienced anything like it before.

‘I felt a warmth and a comfort despite the fact I was going for surgery - I knew it was Mum looking after me. 

'The sensation was in my throat, I had never experienced anything like it before, I felt she had come back to watch over me as I fulfilled her wish. 

'Knowing what she was like I should think she also wanted to have a good look too.’

She recovered well from the surgery and was delighted with her new bust.

Carol says she knows her mother would approve of the way her confidence has grown since the operation.

She explains: ‘I’m more relaxed about my appearance, clothes fit me better and I feel much happier about myself - what mother wouldn’t want that for her daughter?

‘Now every time I look in the mirror I think about mum, what a great way to remember her by.’
