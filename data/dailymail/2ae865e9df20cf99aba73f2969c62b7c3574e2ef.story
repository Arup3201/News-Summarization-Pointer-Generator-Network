A five-year-old girl and a 25-year-old man have been killed - and two others have been left injured - after a New York City cab driver mounted a curb and crashed through a bus stop, police have said.

The unidentified male driver, 44, was reportedly traveling along the snowy Grand Concourse service road near 170th Street in the Bronx on Friday evening when he swerved on to the sidewalk.

His green  taxi struck and killed Kadeem Brown and little Tierre Clark, who were part of a group of people waiting at a bus stop. A 55-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman were also hit by the cab.

The man is being treated for critical injuries at an area hospital, while the woman is said to be in a stable condition. The driver was also taken to hospital with a minor injury following the crash.

Seconds before the incident, the driver had struck a Subaru, which was parked around 100 feet south of 170th Street, causing minor injuries to the woman driving it, police told CBS New York.

Despite the impact, he reportedly continued driving another 100 feet or so, before jumping a curb and crashing into the group waiting at the bus stop. He finally smashed into the wall of a building.

Witnesses reported hearing loud screams as the tragedy unfolded at around 6.30pm. Passerby Ronald Luis said: 'I heard a lot of people screaming, so that’s what really caught my attention.

'And when I looked back, that’s when I saw the car drive onto the sidewalk.'

Speaking to ABC 7, the 18-year-old added: 'It was frantic, very scary, never seen anything like it.'

Shocked: Witnesses reported hearing loud screams as the vehicle crashed through the bus stop in the Bronx. Ronald Luis (pictured), who saw the tragedy occur at around 6.30pm, said: 'I heard a lot of people screaming'

Emergency crews arrived at the bustling Grand Concourse, where they discovered Mr Brown and Miss Clark lying unresponsive on the ground. Mr Brown, who lived nearby, was pronounced dead.

Witnesses watched in shock as medics desperately tried to revive the youngster by carrying out CPR on her small body and rushing her to hospital. But despite their best efforts, she shortly died.

'On this side they were pressing on her chest - the little girl. I’m guessing also she couldn’t breathe. I wasn’t sure,' witness Raymond Fermin told CBS, describing Mr Brown as 'already gone'.

Stuck: It remains unclear how the crash happened. Above, the cab is pictured on the sidewalk in Mount Eden

'[Mr Brown] was lying on the sidewalk in front of the green taxi,' 18-year-old Mr Fermin continued. 'He was face-down, dead. They weren’t even treating him. They just put a white sheet over him.'

It is thought the woman who was injured by the taxi in Mount Eden may be Miss Clark's mother.

It remains unclear  how the crash happened. The cab's front was left completely smashed in. Police and the Taxi and Limousine Commission are investigating, the New York Daily News reported.
