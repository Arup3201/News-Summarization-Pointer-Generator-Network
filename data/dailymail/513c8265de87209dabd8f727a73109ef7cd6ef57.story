A heroic Royal Navy airman helped save seven sailors from the stricken cargo ship which ran aground off the North Wales coast on his very first day on the job.

Just hours before the vessel 'Carrier' hit rocks in the Colwyn Bay area at around 8.15pm, Petty Officer Mike Henson was taking his final assessment to become a qualified search and rescue aircrewman.

Little did he know that later that day he would be putting his training to the ultimate test after being left on board the stranded ship for two hours with powerful waves lashing its side.

PO Henson was part of the crew on the
Royal Navy Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet in Prestwick, Ayrshire, 
which was first on the scene after the vessel ran aground in rough seas 
near Colwyn Bay in North Wales.

The search and rescue crew battled 
Gale Force Nine winds and five metre swells to get to the seven polish 
seamen on board the ship.

PO Henson was lowered onto the deck to help attach the men to the helicopter’s winch.

Four of the crew were airlifted off 
the boat but while the fifth man was being rescued the aircraft 
developed a problem with its winch wire.

PO Henson said a huge wave crashed 
over the side of the boat, pushing one of the crew members against the 
wall of the ship and causing the wire to slack, making it unsafe to haul
any further crew members from the stricken 82-metre long vessel.

Rescue co-ordinators were forced to 
scramble a second helicopter from RAF Leconfield to collect PO Henson, 
the captain of the 'Carrier' boat and the final crew member.

The ship, seen at low tide today, is now resting against the sea defences on the side of the bay

'It is a fantastic job and I am very fortunate to do it,' said PO Henson.

'It was a very hard and testing first day but I have been lucky to be taught by some very good instructors.'

Rescue workers are now urgently trying to pump fuel from a stricken ship that crashed into the shore of North Wales last night.

Fuel has started to leak from the cargo ship 'Carrier', which was carrying 40,000 litres of 'gas oil' when it hit rocks, with seven crew-members aboard, in the Colwyn Bay area at around 8.15pm.

Environmental officers are today working to safely remove 40,000 
litres of fuel from a stricken cargo ship which ran aground in rough 
seas, sparking the rescue of seven crew members.

The ship has leaked a 'small quantity' of oil into surrounding waters, the Environment Agency said.

But the main fuel supply for the boat, which hit rocks near Colwyn 
Bay in North Wales on Tuesday night, is still thought to be intact, the 
Marine and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said.

Oil which was in use at the time has seeped out of the 82-metre long 
vessel but the impact of the oil leak is expected to be 'minimal', 
Environment Agency Wales said.

A spokeswoman said: 'A small quantity of gas oil has already leaked 
from the vessel, and officers are advising the MCA on how best to remove
the remainder of the fuel without damaging the environment.

'If more fuel were to leak from the vessel, current predictions are 
that it would be confined to a small area between Colwyn Bay and Rhyl.

'As much of the escaping gas oil is likely to evaporate and be 
dispersed by the sea, its environmental impact is expected to be minimal
at this stage.

'Officers have also been patrolling the beaches on either side of the
incident checking for signs of pollution. So far, no traces of 
pollution on the beaches have been found.'

The ship is believed to have lost power as it left the jetty, prompting the crash and rescue operation
