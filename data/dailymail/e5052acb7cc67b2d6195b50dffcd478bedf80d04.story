A heart-warming video of a blind cat who loves to hike has gone viral on YouTube.

Honey Bee was rescued in Fiji by an animal shelter, where she was discovered and adopted by her new owners who brought her back to Seattle with them.

Despite her handicap, the sweet feline adores the outdoors, and regularly spends time on the trails in the mountains surrounding the city.

Into the wild: Honey Bee was rescued in Fiji and adopted by her new owners, who live in Seattle

Honey Bee's 'humans' uploaded a video showing her exploring in Mason Lake, outside Seattle, to YouTube last month to raise awareness for her rescue charity AnimalsFiji.org. 

The video has been viewed over 515,000 times since September 8, and Honey Bee even has her own Facebook page.

'Honey Bee is a blind cat we met while in Fiji, and despite being "disabled", she's an extraordinary girl,' her owners write. 'Thank you to Animalsfiji.org for saving her life!

'Hiking goes a bit slower with Honey Bee because there are some many smells and sounds everywhere. Sometimes she's on the trail, sometimes she explores.

... or on her human's shoulders, and squirms when she wants to get down again

'When Honey Bee gets tired, she rides her humans. She squirms when she wants to go down again. She has regular water and snack breaks, just like us. 

'People are always amazed to see a cat on the trail.

'Please consider adopting a special needs animal. Every animal has their own skills and quirks.

'Honey Bee has a cozy pet sling so she can curl up and sleep adorably on our way down the mountain.'

Honey Bee's owners regularly update her Facebook page with photos of her daily activities, and she appears to have settled in well to her new life in the US with four other cats. 

The page has almost 10,000 'likes', and other animal lovers - particularly ones with special needs pets - use Honey Bee's page to connect and share advice and stories.
