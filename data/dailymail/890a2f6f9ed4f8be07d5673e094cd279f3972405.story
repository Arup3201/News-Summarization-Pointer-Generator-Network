Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez is wanted by six European clubs but will not leave Old Trafford before the window closes. 

The Mexico star has been unable to force his way into David Moyes' starting line-up but has attracted attention from Germany, France, Spain and Italy, according to his agent. 

Hernandez - nicknamed Chicharito - is down in the pecking order behind Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck despite his fine goalscoring record for the champions, but United will rebuff any bid for him.

Staying put: But Hernandez's representative refused to rule out a possible move after the World Cup

Building a reputation as a super sub, thanks to his fine performances coming off the bench, Hernandez may be willing to move on, but his representative believes United are unwilling to sell. 

'I was in Manchester [earlier this week], I met with the chairman. Javier is considered among the most important players at the club,' Hernandez's representative told ESPN Deportes.

'Chicharito will not leave United within the next six months, but we do not know what will happen after [the World Cup].

'There’s been a club in Germany, one 
in France, two clubs in Spain and two more in Italy that are hoping to 
count on his services.

'We 
hope that he gets minutes [before the end of the season]. Then, after 
the World Cup, God will tell us what will be the next step.'

The Mexican has scored seven times for David Moyes' side this season, two of those from the bench.
