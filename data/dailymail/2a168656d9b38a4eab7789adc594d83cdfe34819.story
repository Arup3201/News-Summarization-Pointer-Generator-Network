A perfume has been created  especially for Queen Elizabeth II by the Royal Society of Chemistry as a Diamond jubilee Christmas present.

The perfume, which was presented to the Queen on Monday at Buckingham 
Palace was created with her reign and interests in mind representing 
the many facets of our Queen’s personality

Described as a beautiful green floral fragrance created in a classical style with subtle modern twists, the scent, named 'Adamas' after the Greek word for diamond, is a Christmas gift for the Queen in her Diamond Jubilee year which has seen a host of celebrations across the globe.

Long to reign over us: Queen Elizabeth, seen here on her Coronation tour, has been on the throne for 60 years

Fragrance fit for a queen: The Royal Society of Chemistry has created a bespoke perfume inspired by diamonds and the 1950s as a gift for her Majesty

It is contained in a bespoke crystal bottle specially designed by Yorkshire glassmakers David Saunders and Andrew Wallace, and in keeping with the royal family's support of recycling the red, gold and pink bottle was fashioned from recycled Darlington crystal.

The Queen, who celebrated her 65th or Sapphire wedding anniversary this week, has sat on the thrones of seven countries for 60 years since her ascension following her father, King George VI's death in 1952.

In partnership with the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), CPL Aromas, the British-based international fragrance house that created the scent to an RSC brief, took inspiration from the scents and natural products in commonwealth countries, such as Jamaica, Canada and India.

Perfumers Stephene Bengana and Ange Stavrevka, who collaborated to make the scent also wanted to reflect the impressive length of time her Majesty has been on the throne by using fragrances that were characteristically worn  at the time of her coronation.

Ms Stavrevka  said: ‘Sensual floral’s were popular during this era as were fresh and lively green accords both of which feature.’

The Royal inspired perfume has a 
light sweet scent formed from the peach and pear notes combined with 
Lilly of the valley, rose, Indian Jasmine and Tuberose oils, with 
Canadian Cedar Leaf oil adding a deeper, slightly warmer edge to the 
fragrance.

Jamaican 
Pimento Leaf, Sri Lankan Cinnamon leaf and Australian Sandalwood oils 
also help form the warm subtle base behind the perfume.

Incorporating the Commonwealth: The scent contains ingredients from the commonwealth countries which are so important to her Majesty

There is bad news though for anyone 
wanting to smell like the queen, this scent will never be available to 
the common folk: the RSC has confirmed that the fragrance will never be 
offered to anyone other than the Queen.

President of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Professor Lesley Yellowlees said:’ The RSC, of which the Queen  is Patron, wishes to mark her Majesty’s jubilee in a special fashion and with her agreement, we set about creating something that would echo her own interests while having a unique aroma.,’
