A pet parrot has been lauded as a hero after he died saving his teenage owner from a house fire.

Cookie the cockatiel flew to the bathroom to alert Ben Rees, 17, that a fire had broken out in his bedroom by squawking and 'dive-bombing' him.

Thanks to the bird, Ben managed to escape the blaze and call for help.

But sadly, Cookie didn't get out in time and perished in the fire in Llanelli, South Wales.

Ben's mother Vicky Rees, 48, said:Â  'He was Ben's guardian angel - he's a hero and he died a hero.

'Cookie sensed danger and seemed to know that Ben hadn't realised his bedroom was on fire.

'If he hadn't squawked and flapped like that I'm sure Ben would have died in there too.'

Ben was home alone when he lit an incense stick in his bedroom and went to have a shower.

But burning embers from the incense set fire to the teenager's bed and the flames began to engulf his bedroom.

Thankfully, Cookie, whose perch was in Ben's bedroom, was alarmed by the smoke and began squawking loudly.

He then flew into the bathroom and repeatedly 'dive-bombed' his owner who realised that something was wrong.

Although bricklaying and plastering student Ben tried to put some previous fire safety training into action, he was unable to put out the flames and fled the house.

He was given oxygen by firefighters at the scene and treated for shock.

Fire crews managed to stop the flames from spreading throughout the family home.

Ben's mother Vicky added: 'Thank goodness Cookie went to look for Ben - a few moments longer and he would have been trapped in the bathroom.

'It is so sad that Cookie didn't make it out alive - we will never forget what he did.'

The bird was buried by the grateful family today in the garden of their home.

Ben said: 'I'm heartbroken at losing my pet - he saved my life.'
