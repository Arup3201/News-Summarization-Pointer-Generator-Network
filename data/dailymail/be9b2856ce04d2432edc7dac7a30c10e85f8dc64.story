Mo Farah was involved in a lengthy Twitter spat with fellow 5,000m and 10,000m runner Andy Vernon on Tuesday night in which he called his Great Britain team-mate 'an embarrassment'.

Farah responded after Vernon, who earned his best career result to date when he was second to him in the European 10,000m last summer, criticised the lack of high-level competition to face Farah at Birmingham on Saturday.

Double Olympic champion Farah is due to make his season debut at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix at the NIA on Saturday.

The conversation quickly escalated as the two middle-distance runners aired their views on Twitter

'Another stellar field against Mo Farah on home turf this weekend at Birmingham. #joke,' wrote Vernon.

The 31-year-old replied to Vernon, saying: 'Shame you didn't make the line up....again #ComeBackWhenYouWinSomethingDecent'.

Vernon, 29, responded: 'Lol Mo Farah I think even you can work out that I can make the cut to the Indoor Grand Prix. Lets hope no one loses their shoe...'

The argument continued as Farah responded: 'I wish you did make the cut mate so I can leave you in my dust like ALWAYS!! hahahaha #hatersgonnahate'

The exchange continued for an hour, with Vernon replying: '1) stop quoting Taylor Swift. 2) I don't hate you Mo. I would just rather watch a race than the the Mo Show. #playersgonnaplay.'

At that point, Farah made his most stinging remark as he tweeted: 'that's why they didn't put you in the race mate.. Cos you're an embarrassment!! Taylor swift can probably run faster than you!'

Vernon later tweeted: Don't know why this got so blown up. Its no secret that Mo gets weaker fields put together for home races. Ian Stewart would tell you himself.' 

Farah will be the star attraction at Saturday's meeting, which also features European 100m champion James Dasaolu and European and Commonwealth 200m silver medallist Jodie Williams.
