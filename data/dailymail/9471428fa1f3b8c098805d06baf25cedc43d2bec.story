For many, self-destructing Snapchat messages and wiping their phone when it’s stolen is the closest they’ll come to needing to destroy data on a device.

But, for people who work with highly sensitive documents and official secrets - or are extremely paranoid about protecting their personal data - there is now a range of self-destructing hard drives.

Reminiscent of the gadgets in Mission Impossible, the drives can be wiped instantly simply by sending a text message - but they come with a spy price tag of £1,000 ($1,600).

The Autothysis128s and Autothysis128t (pictured centre and right) are 2.5-inch solid state drives, that are controlled using a free smartphone app. When a user loses the drive, they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically. An authentication token (left) adds an extra level of security

There are three self-destructing drives available from London-based Secure Drives, as well as a Master Kill Switch.

Prices start at £938 ($1,500), for the Autothysis DSP, while the Autothysis128s costs £967 ($1,560) and the top-of-the-range Autothysis128t costs £1,027 ($1,663).

The Autothysis128s and Autothysis128t are 2.5-inch solid state drives (SSD), that can be controlled using a free smartphone app available on Android and iOS. 

The drives each have 128GB of encrypted storage and can be fitted to computers, or connected externally using a USB port.

They also have built-in GSM, or cellular technology, which means they can receive text messages.

When a user loses the drive, or wants to permanently delete the data on it, they  send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed. 

In addition to a text message, the data can be destroyed by turning off the GSM signal, entering a PIN too many times incorrectly, removing the drive from a PC, when the battery falls below a certain level, or using an optional authentication token. 

The Authothysis DSP has the same amount of storage and encryption tools as the other two drives, but doesn’t come with GSM functions.

Prices start at £938 ($1,500), for the Autothysis DSP, while the Autothysis128s costs £967 ($1,560) and the top-of-the-range Autothysis128t costs £1,027 ($1,663). 

The Autothysis128s a 2.5-inch solid state drive (SSD), that can be controlled using a free smartphone app available on Android and iOS.

More than one smartphone can be linked to a drive, and if the phone is lost or stolen, the connection can be broken using a PIN code.

The drive has 128GB of encrypted storage and can be fitted to computers, or connected externally using a USB port.

It also has built-in GSM, or cellular technology, which means it can receive text messages.

When a user loses the drive, or wants to permanently delete the data on it, they  send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically.

The technology is designed to fragment, or scramble, the data, making it impossible to extract or read, plus a built-in security measure stops any attempts made to recover the data.

In addition to a text message, the data can be destroyed by turning off the GSM signal, entering a PIN too many times incorrectly, removing the drive from a PC, when the battery falls below a certain level, or using an optional authentication token.

This £111 ($180) token adds an extra level of security and means only the owner can destroy the data.

After the first year, customers  also have to pay an extra £29 ($47) for a yearly GSM subscription.

The Autothysis128t has almost all of the same features as the Autothysis128s, but has added internal security measures  to make the drive even more impenetrable.

The technology is reminiscent of the gadgets used by Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible (pictured in the 2011 Ghost Protocol film). As a result, the Secure Drives also come with a spy price tag. The Autothysis DSP costs £938 ($1,500), the Autothysis128s costs £967 ($1,560) and the Autothysis128t costs £1,027 ($1,663)

And the Authothysis DSP has the same amount of storage and encryption tools as the other two drives, but doesn’t come with GSM functions.

This means the token, PIN entry, removal and battery status destruction methods still work, but the data can’t be destroyed using a text message.

Secure Drives claims its Autothysis drives are legal in more than 100 countries, and are covered by these country’s data protection laws.

The firm also sells a Master Kill Switch (pictured), which can be wirelessly connected to up to 50 computers in a network. Turning the key on the switch automatically wipes the data from all connected computers. Prices for the kill switch are not listed on the site

Although the website claims the devices should have been ready by the ‘second quarter of 2014’, the firm is advising people to sign up for more information about when they will be available.

MailOnline has contacted the firm for more information.
