March Madness is all about fresh new talent coming to the fore on a national level and sometimes it doesn’t even have to be for playing basketball.

The latest breakout star to emerge from this year’s tournament – or certainly an internet sensation who blew up for a couple of hours on Sunday – was Alex Chang, the Stanford Cardinal's wildly-enthusiastic cowbell player.

A showman par excellence, Alex beat his bell as if he life depended upon it and no doubt in some small way contributed to his team’s impressive 60-57 win over Kansas in the third round of the 2014 NCAA Tournament.

Man of the moment: The latest breakout star to emerge from this year's tournament was the Stanford Cardinal's wildly-enthusiastic cowbell player

March Madness is all about fresh new talent coming to the fore on a national level and sometimes it doesn't even have to be for playing basketball

The over-enthusiastic cowbell player who stole the limelight during Sunday's March Madness game between the Cardinal and Kansas has been revealed to be Alex Chang, a Stanford student

His demented cowbell hammering certainly caught the eye of the TV cameras on more than one occasion, and the trance-like state and intensity in his eyes that he achieved left many on social media sites to wonder if perhaps he might have been under the influence of something.

Sports writer Rick Bozich of the Louisville News at one point tweeted that security at the Scottrade Center had told him they had had an issue with band members sneaking in booze, but he later tweeted that security had done a u-turn on those claims and confirmed that no alcohol had been confiscated.

Cowbell guy's impressive moves quickly inspired a host of online chattered and at least two Twitter handles - @StanfordCowbell and @cowbellstanford.

No. 10 seeds Stanford have advanced into the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2008 and with Cowbell guy on their side maybe this could be the year that they go all the way? 

Chang, from Los Altos, California, is studying engineering and is a former member of a cappella group the Standford Mendicants.
