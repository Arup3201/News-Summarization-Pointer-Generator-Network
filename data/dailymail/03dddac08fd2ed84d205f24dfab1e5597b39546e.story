You will know them for being among the country’s greatest celebrities, be it film stars, singers or models.

But here are some faces you may not be so familiar with, for these images are of famous Britons when they were children.

And yesterday the four female stars joined a string of celebrities to have shared photographs from their youth for charity.

Prime suspect for a royal role? This nine-year-old is young Helen Mirren, now 68, who went on to win an Oscar

What a model child this girl is: The six-year-old tucking into an ice-cream cone was years away from finding fame as a model in the 1960s. Now 64, the enigmatic Twiggy has vowed to help orphaned children find a home

Isn't she Absolutely Fabulous! Who knew this girl would one day star in On Her Majesty's Secret Service?

The 67-year-old actress is still dressing up to perform, most recently in Wolf Of Wall Street with Leonardo DiCaprio

In one, a successful actress and presenter balances on a gymnastics beam, under the watchful eye of her coach.

The dark brown pixie-cut hairstyle is now a thing of the past but she can still deliver a performance, albeit in a somewhat different way.

Another, who has become a household name for starring in scores of major films and theatre productions, is recognisable from her wide-lipped smile as she poses on a beach wearing a floral swimsuit, while a young model-in-the-making can be spotted due to her skinny legs as she perches on a concrete step slurping on an ice cream.

This little Brit has talent: Years later she drops the brown bob and grimace (left) for a dazzling smile (see below)

Presenter-to-be: In this gap-toothed school photo she is a little more recognisable as TV's Amanda Holden

Linda Robson: This innocent, chubby-cheeked child would later star in intense drama Birds Of A Feather

Little Nina Wadia, with a twinkling little grin, perfected anger by the time she landed a lead role in EastEnders

Honoured: This young Brenda Blethyn, now 67, grew up to win an OBE and numerous awards for acting

And in a fourth image, a star known for her love of performance proves she had the acting bug at a young age, as she holds her skirt out wide to do a curtsey.

The female stars are backing a campaign by Barnardo’s, which is calling for more people to become foster parents to youngsters in need of homes.

Brenda Farrell, head of fostering and adoption at the charity, said: ‘Without the right foster family to care for them, many vulnerable children may never experience the love and stability they so desperately need and happy memories will remain a distant dream.

What a character: The Scottish crime writer looks dapper and adorable in his kilt, bow tie, and sleek hair

Stylish sweep: This little boy started life in the care of Barnardo's. He became top designer Bruce Oldfield

First a sweet little Stratford girl (left and below), Joy Joyner later found fame as Tanya Branning on EastEnders

Confident: Little Joy was confident and outgoing from a young age before hitting the stage and screen

Dreamy: Despite the whistful gaze, this young Fay Ripley surely knew nothing of the trials and tribulations of romance, which would come when she starred in Cold Feet, her breakthrough role in 1997

'We are truly grateful that so many household names are helping us to broadcast our plea for people to consider becoming foster parents.

‘Currently a third of all children in foster care are moved between different families more than twice every year due to the lack of suitable foster carers.

'The number of children in the care system in the UK has risen for the 7th year in a row to more than 90,000 and at least 8,600 new foster carers are needed in the UK.’
