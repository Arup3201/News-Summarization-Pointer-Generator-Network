Construction workers who were working on Madonna Badger's Connecticut mansion before it burned down in a tragic Christmas Day fire are being repeatedly questioned by police in the criminal investigation of the fire’s five deaths.

Michael Borcina is a contractor who had been renovating the five-bedroom $1.7million house that was owned by his girlfriend Miss Badger. Ms Badger’s three daughters and her parents all died in the early morning blaze.

Stamford police have questioned all involved- including Mr Borcina and Ms Badger- in order to learn details about the fire.

Police told the New York Post: 'We’re trying to accelerate this and hopefully have something [to release to the public] within the next week and a half, two weeks.'

They have concluded that it was sparked by some still-hot embers from the fireplace that Mr Borcina placed in a garbage in the mudroom after Ms Badger’s daughters asked for the fireplace to be cleared on Christmas Eve to make way for Santa.

At the time of the fire, the mansion was still under construction, and though it did have a fire alarm system in place, it was not installed and working at the time.

Mr Borcina’s company, Tiberias Construction, has been heavily scrutinized during the investigation as well, and it was discovered that several required forms were missing.

The house did not have a new certificate of occupancy since the Badgers moved in, and Mr Borcina’s contracting licenses had expired at the time of the fire. His contractor registration for work in the state of Connecticut expired in 2000, and his home improvement license for the state of New York expired in June 2010.

Mr Borcina has hired Eugene Riccio, a high-profile criminal defence attorney, to represent him in this case, but this is not his first run in with the law over his construction sites.

Greenwich Time reports that he owes almost $100,000 in from previous legal judgements, and is also in the midst of two other lawsuits from clients- one in Manhattan and one in Long Island.

Police have officially ruled out any foul play in the investigation into the Badger home fire, but are now looking to see if there are any accidental criminal charges that will be filed. Specifically, charges of criminally negligent homicide or reckless manslaughter are both possible charges in a case like this.

Because the house was torn down immediately after the fire, at the request of the local fire department which deemed it a continued safety risk, investigators are not hoping to find any evidence at the scene.

Instead it is more a matter of what steps were taken to ensure the safety of the home before anyone started staying there.

Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was Stamford's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people.

The fire killed 7-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger, 9-year-old Lily Badger and grandparents Lomer and Pauline Johnson.

Mr Johnson was a department store Santa Claus who had worked as safety director for a Louisville, Kentucky, company.

Mr Borcina appeared at Ms Badger’s side- along with her ex-husband and his current girlfriend- at the January 5 funeral for the three girls.
