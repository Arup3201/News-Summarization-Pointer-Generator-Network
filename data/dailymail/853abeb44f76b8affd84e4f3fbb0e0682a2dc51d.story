When it was released in 1995, ‘Toy Story’ was revolutionary for being the first feature-length computer animated film.

Nearly two decades later, two amateur film makers have taken it upon themselves to reconstruct the movie in a more traditional medium, making a full-length live action tribute to the Pixar classic.

Jonason Pauley, 19, and Jesse Perrotta, 21, spent the better part of two years meticulously recreating the iconic movie, and recently posted their finished film on YouTube.

First: Pixar's version of Buzz using his laser on Woody (though he would later find out it's not as powerful as would be hoped)

Speaking with MailOnline, Mr Pauley said that the two years he and Mr Perrotta spent on their project was a labor of love. 

‘It was just something fun to do,’ he said, adding that the two worked on the movie in their free time. ‘We started by filming on the weekends, all day on Saturdays. Eventually it ended up being, we have to finish because we’re using this person’s time or space.’

‘Toy Story,’ he added, was his favorite film as a child (and still is). Prior to the project, he had already watched the film ‘hundreds of times.’

The actors, Mr Pauley said, were mostly friends or acquaintances from church. ‘Andy and Sit are brothers to each other, friends of mine from my old church,’ he said. ‘They fit the part closely enough, and they were always anxious to be in one of my films.’

The full-length film was shot on a consumer camcorder, using an amalgamation of green screens, stop-motion animation, and good old-fashioned puppetry.

Mr Pauley was usually behind the camera while Mr Perrotta operated the puppet’s strings, though the two would sometimes switch roles.

Filming a live-action ‘Toy Story’ proved to be difficult in spots. The actors were all young volunteers (TJ Bright, Victor Bright, Carla Pauley, Abigale Peters, and Delani Kent) and some scenes required tricky camerawork and post-production.

The most difficult scene, Mr Pauley said, was the finale, where some of the toys are chasing their owner Andy in the RV. 

He said it was difficult getting the exact shots with actual dogs, and from a moving vehicle. 

After countless hours of shooting and editing, the film was done.

Mr Pauley, who is currently studying film at Northern Arizona University, said he and his filming partner had always imagined traveling to the studios outside of San Francisco to celebrate. 

Upon their arrival to the Emeryville studios, the young men were allowed to stand out front and hand out DVDs of the finished movie. ‘A number of (the Pixar employees) were excited to watch it and hear about it,’ he said.

The live-action ‘Toy Story’ uses the audio from the film, which stars the vocal talents of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as the unflappable Buzz Lightyear.

Risky business: Mr Pauley said that the final rescue scene with Woody and Buzz was tricky to film, because it was a moving shot involving real animals and difficult angles

Reach: The original 'Toy Story' cost $30million to produce and was the first feature-length film to be computer animated

While the duo never got explicit permission to be able to use Pixar’s material, Mr Pauley said that he and Mr Perrotta had tweeted at top-Pixar executives several times before publishing their work to YouTube, and had never gotten an explicit ‘no.’

‘They said just do it,’ he said. ‘If they’re okay with it, that’s cool.’

Mr Pauley said he loves the end product. ‘I’m glad we did it,’ but adds that it was a learning experience. 

As of Sunday evening, their film has garnered some 253,000 views to very positive acclaim. One viewer wrote: ‘This is so cool on so many levels! Fantastic!’

Pixar’s ‘Toy Story’ had an estimated $30million budget, and grossed more than $360million worldwide.
