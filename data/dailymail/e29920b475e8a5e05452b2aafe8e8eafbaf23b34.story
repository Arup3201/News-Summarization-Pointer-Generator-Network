As a veteran of an Antarctic trek, Prince Harry is no stranger to the cold but while going bare-headed today, the royal seemed to feel the chill.

The 30-year-old grabbed a young man's bobble hat and either seemed to be readjusting the item or preparing to take it for himself.

It was all part of a visit to Huntingdon Academy in Nottingham to discuss the Full Effect Youth Project in St. Ann's.

Harry seemed happy to pose for a snap by one of the children who have been working on a film based on the real-life experiences of young people

But Demani Cowin-Jenkins, who was wearing the blue and white-striped headgear wasn't distracted from showing the prince and Mick Dawber, a worker with EPIC, a partnership of headteachers and youth workers, a bicycle tyre he was working on in the school's bike repair shop.

Prince Harry laughed and joked his way through the visit to discuss the programme which works with young people and and children from primary schools in St Ann's to deter them from becoming involved in youth violence and gang-related crime.

He  met the stars and creators of a new film, Guillemot, based on the real-life experiences of young people and filmed in Nottingham's  St Ann's area.

The film, which is Full Effect's first completed project, began filming in April 2014 and will premiere in early 2015. 

Dressed casually in a grey fleece over a pale blue shirt with jeans and brown suede desert boots, the royal chatted to the young actors, producers and scriptwriters at the school before heading off for the premiere at the city's Cornerhouse Cinema.

Prince Harry visited the school's eco-garden which includes a greenhouse made out of plastic bottles, a bicycle repair workshop and football coaching.

Harry talked to Nottingham youngsters involved in a range of after-school activities

Many of the teenagers who spoke to Harry said they had met him before on one of his two previous visits and one joked he was becoming a 'regular visitor' to the area.

The Prince also watched a game of football, but decided not to take part in the kickabout. 

The Full Effect project is a community initiative in St Ann's aimed at tackling problems including youth violence and gangs, as well as improving opportunities for the young people involved. 

It aims to train young people to be fully qualified youth leaders and provides extra-curricular activities to primary school children.  

It's supported by the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Harry seemed in great spirits as he chatted with the children involved in the Full Effect Youth Project, which is supported by the Royal Foundation, as they showed him round their eco-garden

Headteacher Teres Shrestha told the Nottingham Post: 'I'm absolutely thrilled he's come to meet our children.

'It's really important that he supports and believes in our community here – it's something really positive.'

'We talked about how important it is to develop positive role models for future generations and he was really interested.

'The kids didn't know he was coming here and only found out when they met him so it was a nice surprise.

'It's great for them to share their work with a member of the Royal Family.'

It was Prince Harry's second official engagement of the year after he kicked off his royal calendar with a trip to Twickenham Rugby Stadium to meet marathon runners raising money for his charities.
