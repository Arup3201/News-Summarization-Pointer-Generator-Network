President Barack Obama has insisted he wasn't offended by Clint Eastwood's Republican National Convention jibe in which the movie star interrogated an empty chair that he said represented the nation's leader.

'One thing about being president or running for president - if you're easily offended, you should probably choose another profession,' Obama told USA Today.

The legendary Hollywood actor stole the show at the RNC and sparked an internet craze now known as 'Eastwooding' after he had a heated, and hilarious, discussion with an invisible Obama, grilling a chair about the President's legacy.

Still a fan: President Barack Obama, pictured in Colorado today, insists he wasn't offended by Clint Eastwood's Republican National Convention jibe in which the movie star interrogated an empty chair that he said represented

Obama, who was campaigning in Bolder, Colarado, today, went on to call Eastwood 'a great actor, and an even better director' in the interview.

'I think the last few movies that he's made have been terrific,' he added.

He also praised Mitt Romney's business career, describing his Republican rival as 'incredibly successful' as well as 'disciplined and hard-working'.

However, Mr Obama had harsher words for his GOP rival's healthcare plans, saying they could be summarised as 'Romney doesn't care'.

The President said: 'You know, he calls it Obamacare. I like the name. I do care.

'I don't know exactly what the other side is proposing - I guess you could call it "Romney doesn't care". But this law is here to stay.'

In a fierce defence of his controversial reforms, Mr Obama said: 'Governor Romney promised that on his first day in office he's gonna sit right down, grab a pen and repeal Obamacare.

'What that means is that right away he'd kick 7 million young people off their parents' plan. He'd take hope away from tens of millions of American with pre-exiting conditions by repealing reform.'

Prime-time jibe: Clint Eastwood, pictured during his speech on Thursday, stole the show at the RNC and sparked an internet craze now known as 'Eastwooding' after his heated discussion with an invisible Obama

Obama's
response to Clint Eastwood's speech was the most 
re-tweeted tweet of the Republican convention, a Twitter spokesman told TPM.

It
was the President's second most re-tweeted tweet of all time, after his
note a few months ago showing his support for gay marriage.

As
of today, more than 51,000 people had re-tweeted the picture of the 
back of Obama's head in the grandiose leather chair embossed with his title, with a 
message saying 'This seat's taken.'

While the President was expressing 
his approval of Eastwood's performance, other leading Democrats were far
less complimentary towards last week's GOP convention.

Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles who is chair of the 
Democrats' convention, said the Republican plan for office 'looks like 
the platform of 1812'.

In an appearance on Fox News, he added that 'Reagan would be turning in his grave' over the GOP's current agenda.

Campaign aide Stephanie Cutter went even further, suggesting that the convention shows Republicans 'think lying is a virtue'.

Rahm Emanuel, the President's combative former chief of staff, was also 
on the attack, saying that Mr Romney's speech had 'nothing memorable' 
about it.

But other Obama allies were forced to be more defensive, with Maryland 
governor Martin O'Malley admitting that Americans were not 'better off 
today than they were four years ago' in an interview on CBS's Face the 
Nation.

And Bill Richardson, former governor of New Mexico, resorted to arguing 
that Mr Obama would win the support of 'the international community' in 
his re-election attempt.

These remarks all came as 
hundreds of protesters marched on 'Wall Street South' in Charlotte, 
North Carolina, and the town ramped up security ahead of the Democratic 
National Convention.

About 600 marchers carried signs and banners, including one accusing Obama of murdering children with drones, yesterday afternoon but the lively demonstration was a fraction of the size organisers had hoped.

The march's general purpose was to decry corporate greed, but it drew people demonstrating for a variety of causes.

Meanwhile, hundreds of law enforcement officers from 
across the country descended on the Charlotte Police Training 
Academy, getting ready for the convention, which officially starts on Tuesday.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg
police haven't said exactly how many officers are being brought in for 
the event, but they said they are ready for any challenge that may present itself.

'We
have (officers) in all areas and all facets of the venues, the traffic 
assignments, the different visits, the routes people can expect to see 
different colored patches and uniforms from all over the place,' Maj. 
Jeff Estes told NY 1.

There will be countless security 
hotspots in Charlotte during the convention but the most secretive is a 
17,000-square-foot office building near the airport, where more than 50 
agencies will house their representatives, according to Officer.com.

The building, filled with tables, chairs and big-screen TVs, is called the Multi-Agency Communication Center and is the guts of the U.S. government, the website claims.

It will house staff from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the Secret Service from today.

The protest on the streets of Charlotte was planned as the week's biggest demonstration but the turn out was poor compared to the thousands organisers had touted.

At
one point, about two-dozen of the protesters attempted to be disruptive
by sitting down and locking arms in front of the headquarters for Bank 
of America.

They had the phone numbers of lawyers written on their arms.

But police officers standing nearby took no action. The group sat for about 10 minutes before getting up and moving on.

At least 100 officers in plain uniforms walked along with the parade, carrying gas masks, wooden batons and plastic hand ties.

A police helicopter hovered so low that people on the ground could feel the wind off its rotors. Organizers have pledged that the march will be peaceful.

Aided by the pleasant weather, the 
protesters showed more spirit than their rain-soaked counterparts at 
last week's Republican National Convention in Tampa. There, effects of 
Hurricane Isaac's outer bands thinned the ranks of protesters.

The Charlotte demonstrators had 
anti-war signs as well as those promoting unionized labor and the plight
of undocumented immigrants.

One
read: 'Bankrupting America' with a font and logo that mimicked Bank of 
America. Another said: 'OBAMA MURDERS CHILDREN WITH DRONES.'

Participants ranged from young girls in cheerleading outfits and parents pushing strollers to Occupy Wall Street demonstrators in black shirts and red bandannas.

The route of the march was also taking 
demonstrators by a major office hub for Wells Fargo.

The banks are two 
of the nation's largest financial institutions and beneficiaries of 
massive taxpayer-backed loans during the 2008 bailout of the financial 
sector. Both banks have also been criticized for roles in the home 
foreclosure crisis.

Before the march, the demonstrators gathered at a park on the outskirts of Charlotte's Uptown business district. Speakers addressed the crowd from a stage in front of a banner that read 'PEOPLE POWER NOW.'

Official convention events begin on Tuesday, but thousands of delegates, officials, protesters and journalists began gathering over the weekend.Â
