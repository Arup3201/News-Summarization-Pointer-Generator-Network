During his summing-up, the judge asked the jury trying Dhanuson Dharmasena, the first British doctor to stand trial for allegedly carrying out female genital mutilation, to consider whether he was simply a scapegoat.

By their decision to acquit him, we are entitled to believe that the answer to that question was an emphatic ‘yes’.

Indeed, few people – outside the Crown Prosecution Service – who have followed this disturbing case could have been left in much doubt that Dr Dharmasena was the real victim.

The brief facts which put him in the dock are as follows.

Back in 2012, Dr Dharmasena was a junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Whittington Hospital in north London. One of his patients was a young pregnant woman identified only as AB. AB had indeed been subjected to female circumcision in her native Somalia.

To make it possible for the baby to be delivered, Dr Dharmasena had to cut through the stitches made during the barbaric procedure. Afterward, he replaced them to stop the woman, who now lives in Britain, bleeding. However the prosecution claimed she was stitched in such a way that her urethra was obstructed and the ‘vagina entrance’ narrowed.

This, they claimed, amounted to FGM.

The defence disputed this account. Tellingly, you might think, the notes relating to an examination by an FGM specialist mysteriously went missing.

Would it be too cynical to suggest that if those notes had been as potentially incriminating as the prosecution maintained, they would not have disappeared?

Either way, many might think that equating what Dr Dharmasena did with the almost medieval savagery involved in female genital mutilation beggars belief.

Nevertheless, those few stitches cost Dr Dharmasena his career and his reputation. He was suspended by the General Medical Council in March following an internal investigation lasting nearly two years. He is still facing the ordeal of a GMC hearing and possible disciplinary action.

Dr Dharmasena and his wife, also a doctor, from Ilford, Essex, who were married in 2010, delayed moving home and starting a family of their own because of the cloud of suspicion hanging over him. He has also received death threats.

Only when the trial got under way did the shortcomings of the evidence against him become scandalously apparent.

The woman herself, now 27, did not make an official complaint against Dr Dharmasena. It was a midwife who was present during surgery who reported him. Nor did the patient give a statement to the police.

‘AB has no complaints against the doctor,’ his barrister Zoe Johnson, reminded the court in her final address to the jury. ‘Do you remember, when giving evidence, she said “he delivered my first baby” with a smile on her face.’

Moreover, Dr Dharmasena was not a Muslim. He is a Sri Lankan Hindu who came to this country when he was a boy. FGM is not practised in Hindu culture. ‘I regard it as an abhorrent practice,’ he told the court.

He completed his medical training in 2005. He underwent two years further training before training at the Royal Free in London, arriving at the Whittington in 2012. So why did this case ever come before a jury? Might the real reason have more to do with politics, both inside and outside medicine, than justice, as the judge alluded to in his summing-up. The CPS has been under increasing pressure from campaigners to secure an FGM conviction.

The number of women and teenage girls in England and Wales who are victims has increased three-fold to 170,000 over the past decade due to the influx of migrants from countries where the practice is widespread.

In the majority of these cases FGM is thought to have taken place abroad, not in Britain, which makes the decision to charge Dr Dharmasena all the more controversial. Indeed, the announcement to charge him, in a blaze of publicity, came just days before Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, appeared before the Commons home affairs committee to explain why there had been no FGM prosecutions in the UK.

When committee chairman Keith Vaz expressed his surprise that this prosecution had suddenly occurred almost 30 years after FGM was outlawed, Miss Saunders replied: ‘The fact is we’ve had the evidence that’s been supplied to us that’s enabled us to bring a prosecution, it’s as simple as that.’

Not everyone agreed, then or now. Leading gynaecologist Dr Katrina Erskine accused the CPS of putting politics before the welfare of women. She said she and other obstetricians were ‘up in arms over the decision to prosecute this case, which involved a woman who had already suffered FGM and warned it would distract from the real problem’.

Indeed, the court heard that the woman at the centre of this story should have been identified as a victim of FGM by medics before she gave birth.

This would have meant she was put on a special care ‘pathway’ with midwives who are experienced in dealing with such cases. But this opportunity was missed when she arrived at hospital in labour in November 2012.

‘If AB had followed the FGM pathway he [Dr Dharmasena] would never have been in the situation he found himself,’ his barrister told the court. Dr Dharmasena had ‘absolutely no training’ in this field during his undergraduate studies. Even so, AB had suffered no problems since Dr Dharmasena had treated her and had gone on to have a second child and is now expecting a third.

There were other systemic failures at the hospital. No official interpreter was present during AB’s birth – a position Dr Dharmasena should not have been placed in. And, as we have already said, crucial notes reinforcing the prosecution case went missing.

‘These are serious systemic failings, none of which are Dr Dharmasena’s fault,’ his barrister claimed. He had, she said, been ‘hung out to dry.’

Did ‘systemic failings’ within the hospital and mounting pressure to secure an FGM conviction conspire against Dr Dharmasena? It’s is hard to avoid that conclusion.

In January last year, a report by a left-wing campaigning journalist Julie Bindel, called An Unpublished Crime, said of 3,032 FGM cases treated by hospitals in the past three years, only 3 per cent were referred to the police and 11 per cent to local authorities.

‘Professionals working in this field,’ the report concluded, ‘believed that a few high-profile criminal actions could act as a deterrent and demonstrate that the state is taking this form of violence against women as seriously as other forms. Nothing would boost the campaign against FGM more powerfully than some convictions. That would send out a message loud and clear that the state is taking the problem seriously.’

The Dharmasena case has had precisely the opposite effect – and almost ruined a good man and widely respected doctor in the process.
