A man who spent 18 years in prison on Death Row because a Chicago cop withheld or fabricated evidence against him had been seeking $18 million in damages - but was awarded just $80,000.

A federal jury handed down their ruling on the lawsuit on Thursday morning over the gaffe, which will be paid for by Chicago taxpayers.

Former El Rukn gang member Nathson Fields, who was convicted of a double murder in 1986 but freed at a retrial in 2009, said the decision was a travesty.

Now 60, Fields has called on U.S. Attorney Zach Fardon to investigate, The Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Fields spent 18 years in prison, 12 of them on Death Row.

It wasn't until after he was cleared that a missing file connected to his case was finally 'discovered', buried within an old filing cabinet in the basement of a South Side police station.

Both police and prosecutors denied the file existed for years, but Field's lawyer claimed it was deliberately hidden because it contained evidence that may have cleared him.

The attorney claimed Chicago police had a policy of hiding the 'street files' of detectives, which contained notes from defendents, for decades.

Fields' street file was contained a cabinet with unsolved cases that dated back as far as 1944.

Former CPD sergeant David O'Callaghan said the jury's decision showed he always conducted clean investigations.

The jury did find however that O’Callaghan violated Fields’ right to due process by withholding or fabricating evidence.

Trial testimony suggested that police backdated statements and may have doctored lineups in an attempt to convict Fields.

Fields’ lawyers did not ask jurors for a specific amount in damaged, but hinted that $1 million for every year Fields spent behind bars seemed appropriate.

Lawyers for the city argued Fields deserved nothing, maintaining that he was guilty of the double murder, despite his overturned conviction.

Speaking outside court Thursday, Fields said he was happy that jurors found O’Callaghan liable, but said he was saddened by the award of damages that amount to less than $5,000 for every year he spent behind bars.

He noted that there were no fellow African-Americans on his jury, and urged federal prosecutors to seize 20 filing cabinets of 'street files' from the basement where his long lost file was found.

If uncovered, street files from other cases will exonerate other wrongfully convicted prisoners, he said.

Ruth Sandifer, Fields' sister, said O’Callaghan should have been charged with attempted murder, because 'he framed my brother to send him to Death Row'.
