Singer Glen Campbell's wife said that he’s probably ‘not aware’ that he was nominated for an Oscar for best song, because of his advancing Alzheimer’s.

Mr Campbell was nominated for the song I’m Not Gonna Miss You, a goodbye to his loved ones, which features in the documentary Glen Campbell, I’ll Be Me.

Country singer Tim McGraw performed a moving rendition of it during the Academy Awards show last night, as Mr Campbell is now too poorly to play in public.

Kim Campbell said on the red carpet before the ceremony that her husband wouldn’t really understand what was happening.

She said: ‘I'm not sure if he's really aware but he will be at his own little Oscar party tonight. It would be lovely to go back and let him hold one. It's just hard for him to understand.’

Best Song gong went to rap artist Common and R&B star John Legend for Glory, the anthem from Selma.

Glen Campbell, I’ll Be Me documents how the singer and his family came to terms with his condition and his farewell tour across America in 2011, which saw him perform in 151 sold-out shows.

The documentary features appearances from Bruce Springsteen, The Edge and Paul McCartney.

The best actor award went to Brit Eddie Redmayne, who was almost too choked to speak as he picked up the gong for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.

'Thank you – I don’t I’m capable of articulating quite how I feel right now but please know this – I am fully aware of that I am lucky, lucky man,’ he began, clutching his trophy.

'This Oscar – wow! –this Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world, battling ALS,’ he added staring at the statuette in disbelief.

Meanwhile, it might not have swept the board completely, but Birdman still flew home with the Oscar for Best Picture on the night.

The comedy drama swooped off with a total of four awards on Sunday night - a number that tied with The Grand Budapest Hotel - including Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.

However, Birdman's lead actor Michael Keaton was beaten to his Best Actor by Eddie.

Backstage, 33-year-old Eddie revealed that winning was like a 'weird and wild dream'. 

There were no surprises when it came to the actresses, with favourites Julianne Moore winning for Best Actress for Still Alice, and Patricia Arquette winning for Boyhood. 

The other big winner of the night was Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, taking home four awards in total. 

The energetic evening saw Oscar host Neil Patrick Harris put on a theatrical performance at the Kodak theatre. 

Neil, 41, only managed a few jokes before bringing out his jazz hands, performing a hilarious original song - Moving Pictures - about the great and good of Hollywood. 

Neil’s spirited routine - where he was joined by Anna Kendrick and Jack Black - paid tribute to some of Hollywood’s best known performances and scenes, and had the star-studded audience. 

Taking home the first of award of the night was J.K. Simmons for Whiplash - a perhaps unsurprising win considering he has swept the board in the same category this awards season. 

The actor - who won for his portrait of a demented music teacher in the film Whiplash - paid tribute to his wife Michelle Schumacher.
