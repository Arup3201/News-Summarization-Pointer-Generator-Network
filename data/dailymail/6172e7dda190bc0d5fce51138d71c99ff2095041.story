The man who jumped over the White House fence this month got further into the building than security officials let on, it has emerged.

Senior sources reveal Omar Gonzalez, 42, made it all the way to the East Room of the first floor as he tore past five rings of security on September 19 wielding a knife.

He allegedly ran freely across the 70-yard front lawn, through the North Portico hall past a guard, and into the East Room, which is next to the staircase leading to the family's living quarters - 168 feet into the executive mansion.

Eventually, he was subdued in the Green Room by a plainclothes guard.

Revealed: Omar Gonzalez is said to have made it all the way to the East Room of the White House

Route: Gonzalez allegedly made it 168 feet into the building, through the North Portico hall to the East Room

The East Room of the White House is an 80-foot-long hall used for formal events including bill signings, press conferences, receptions and ceremonies.

A Secret Service official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Washington Post an alarm box near the front entrance of the White House had been muted. 

'The Secret Service has no comment on that at this time due to the ongoing investigation,' Brian Leary, a spokesman for the agency, said of the Post story. 

A White House spokesman declined comment.

The revelations come a day after a report revealed the Secret Service was unaware for four days that a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the White House in 2011 in a 'fumbled' response that left the Obamas furious.

Officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez shot at least seven bullets at the executive mansion in Washington from his car.

At the time, President Barack Obama, his wife Michelle and their older daughter Malia were not at home, but their younger daughter Sasha and Mrs Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, were inside.

Security breach: Senior sources said he made it past five rings of security before he was subdued by a sixth

Tomorrow, Secret Service director Julia Pierson will be forced to respond to both incidents at a hearing with the Government Reform Committee. 

Gonzalez, a homeless Iraq veteran, was charged with unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon. 

Security officials say he did not express any wish to harm the president instead claiming he just wanted to tell him that the 'atmosphere was collapsing'. 

Still, his successful attempt on the White House raises serious security questions. He is the first person believed to have jumped the fence and made it into the building.

A prosecutor said in court last week that officers found more than 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets and a machete in Gonzalez's car.

Serving his country: Gonzalez, pictured with then-sister-in-law Nancy Hoover and her husband, served three tours in Iraq before suffering injuries in an IED blast. He has been homeless for the last three months

Gonzalez, who completed three tours of Iraq, had been arrested in July with a sniper rifle and a map on which the executive mansion was marked, the prosecutor said. 

The alarm box near the entrance, designed to alert guards to an intruder, had been muted at what officers believe was the request of the usher's office, the Post said, citing the Secret Service official.

The officer posted inside the door appeared to be delayed in learning the intruder was about to come through, the Post said. 

Officers are trained to lock the front door immediately if they learn of an intruder on the grounds.
