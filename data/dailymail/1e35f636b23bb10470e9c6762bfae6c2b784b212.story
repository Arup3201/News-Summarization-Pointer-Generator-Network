A Tory MP criticised the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary yesterday after he announced new green energy projects that will lead to higher bills.

Ed Davey said the five new offshore wind farms and three wood-burning plants would supply 2million homes, create 8,500 jobs and attract £12billion of private investment.

But he was accused of exploiting the crisis in Ukraine, which he said highlighted the need to develop home-grown power, as a ‘cover’ for expensive projects.

The government announced eight new renewable energy projects,m including four offshore wind sites (file picture)

Investors get a guaranteed price for 
the electricity they produce – around double the wholesale cost – some 
of which is added on to consumer electricity bills.

Mr
 Davey said the average bill increase would be £11 a year by 2020 – a 2 
per cent rise – but insisted green energy would make power more 
affordable in the long term.

However,
 the Renewable Energy Foundation think-tank and a source at one of the 
major electricity suppliers calculated the rise in bills from these 
projects would be around £20.

Britain
 sources less than 1 per cent of its gas directly from Russia but, at 
peak times, gas of Russian origin is imported from countries such as 
Germany.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted prices would be higher without investment in green projects

It comes to Europe via a pipeline through Ukraine.

The eight projects, which will power more than three million homes by producing 4.5GW of electricity, are:

Mr Davey has accused Russia of ‘holding the West to ransom’ by threatening to increase its gas prices, and warned that Britain has to produce its own supply.

Peter Lilley, a 
Tory member of the Energy and Climate Change Committee, suggested the 
comments provided ‘a bit of collateral cover’ for putting up prices.

The former trade minister said the rise was unacceptable for a single round of new contracts.

He
 said: ‘If you just add 2 per cent to bills, and the next batch adds 2 
per cent, and so on, it soon adds up to what Labour might call a 
cost-of-living crisis.

‘Clearly
 Europe as whole needs to become less dependent on Russian gas, but we 
need more of our own capacity, which will bring down costs. The way to 
do this is perhaps to go ahead with fracking.’

In
 an embarrassment for the Energy Secretary, the Drax power station in 
North Yorkshire, where one of the new projects is based, has announced 
plans to sue his department.

Only
 one of the two plants that it anticipated would be converted from coal 
to wood-chip was announced, and the firm’s shares fell by 13 per cent.

A
 spokesman said it would make a legal challenge.

Energy
tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Even in the face of price hikes, shrewd consumers can take advantage of 
this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to 
ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will 
save you significant amounts.

Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

If you are one of the millions of
people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original 
supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly 
as much as £300 a year.

Prices
are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff
that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.
