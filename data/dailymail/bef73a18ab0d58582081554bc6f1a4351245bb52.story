Martin Atkinson has been backed for his handling of Chelsea’s incident packed game with Burnley for ALL of his key decisions by the referees’ assessor.

Jose Mourinho claimed Atkinson missed a number of key moments in the game and called for called for more technology to help officials.

Mourinho felt aggrieved as Chelsea drew the game with Burnley 1-1 and saw their lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League pegged back to five points by Manchester City.

Referee Martin Atkinson has been backed by the referees’ assessor for his handling of Chelsea's game 

Speaking on Goals on Sunday, Mourinho said: 'They [the referees] are trying but they are not doing well. They are trying. Of course, they are trying. What I would improve? If the referee cannot see a penalty three metres in front of him, some official in front of a screen cannot miss it.

'If we want to protect the integrity and honesty of the referees, if we want to believe that the mistake is a consequence of a misinterpretation, of a bad position, of unpredictability of the situation and the game, I think technology can help.

'If I was a referee I would welcome it. Same thing with goal line technology. It makes a difference. You go one, two, three, four, five weeks without any incidents where you think goal line technology is not important, but in a certain moment goal line technology will be important.

The Chelsea boss feels his side should have been given two penalties in the first half and Ashley Barnes sent off for kicking out at Branislav Ivanovic.

Mourinho was left frustrated again in the 70th minute by Barnes again, this time for his challenge on Nemanja Matic – which resulted in the Chelsea midfielder seeing red for pushing the Burnley man over in retaliation.

But Atkinson has been backed by referees’ assessor Steve Greaves who was in the stands at Stamford Bridge and monitoring the official's performance.

Jose Mourinho went on Sky's Goals on Sunday to vent his frustration over the decisions 

On the first penalty claim in the 32nd minute for a handball by Michael Kightly, Greaves wrote in his report, which has been published in The Sun, ‘correct decision as ball hit with pace from close range and didn’t see it as deliberate.’

Before the break Chelsea appealed for another penalty when Diego Costa went down after a challenge by Jason Shackell.

But again, Greaves backed Atkinson. He wrote: ‘Both in real time and on DVD my opinion is that Costa is looking to go down as soon as contact is made. However, Shackell does put his hands on him so appreciate your thoughts!! Also to note, ref can’t actually see Shackell’s hands on Costa.’

On the moment that saw Matic sent off and Barnes avoid punishment, assessor Greaves again agreed with Atkinson’s decision, he said: ‘In super slow mo it obviously looks awful, but in real time live and dvd Barnes catches him as follow through from the challenge. (Does Barnes mean to harm him?-only he knows) Also, looks worse because Matic has his foot planted…’

Greaves also supported Atkinson for sending Matic off for his retaliation. Chelsea have appealed the decision and hope that if successful that the Serbia international will be available for Sunday’s Capital One Cup final with London rivals Tottenham.

Greaves has been in football for most of his life and started as a player at Fulham, Preston, Ipswich and Scunthorpe but saw his career cut short by injury and retired at 23.

He moved into coaching and has worked for Ipswich and Stevenage before moving to work with the Southampton academy and coached the likes of Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and James Ward-Prowse.

He then became a referees’ assessor with the FA this season.
