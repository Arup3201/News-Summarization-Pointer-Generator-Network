A couple have been caught on camera stroking a pet cat before calmly stealing it.

The crime was captured last week and ten-year-old Busby has not been seen since.

CCTV footage shows a man and a woman spot Busby and then look around the York car park to check that nobody is looking.

They then lean in to stroke the friendly ginger and white cat before snatching him.

Owner Chris Howson, 39, described the footage as 'chilling' and has reported the abduction to police.

He said: 'It’s chilling to watch. Busby is a really friendly, loving cat and you can tell he happily goes over to the couple and lets them stroke him.

'You can see them looking around - they 
know they are doing something wrong. I hope they are looking after him, 
and that it’s nothing more sinister.

Busby the cat, who was stroked by a couple of strangers outside owner Chris Howson's York home before they picked him up, checked for witnesses and calmly abducted him

'I’m devastated about him being taken. He’s lived with me for ten years and is very much part of my family.

'He is a loveable cat and friendly with everyone, but he has a special bond with me as I am his owner and he knows where he lives and his surroundings.'

The CCTV footage was only available because another resident had set up cameras after his car was vandalised.

North Yorkshire Police are now hunting for the cat-snatchers, and Mr Howson is offering a reward for his pet's safe return.

He said: 'He’s really well-known in 
this area and the neighbours love him. He sits with the postman when 
he’s having his sandwiches.

'I’m so grateful that so many people have been helping out with the search, and hopefully Busby will be returned home soon.

'It’s been nearly a week and my other cat, seven-year-old Junior, is really missing him. He is a friendly cat but he knows where his home is, and he’ll be missing it.

'If the couple who took him do the decent thing and come forward, I’ll let it go. But if not, I’ll press charges.

'I reported the matter to the police on Saturday and they’ve been really helpful.

'I didn’t think they’d take it that seriously but the police officer who watched the CCTV images with me agreed that the couple look around to see if there are any witnesses.'
