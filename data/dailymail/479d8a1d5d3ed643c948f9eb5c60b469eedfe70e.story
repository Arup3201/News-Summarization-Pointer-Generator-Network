Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plans to return to work next week after being treated for a blood clot in her head. The 65-year-old spent three days at  New
 York-Presbyterian Hospital receiving treatment for the condition and was discharged late on Wednesday.

State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said on Thursday that Clinton is resting at home but is speaking with senior staff and is 'sounding terrific, upbeat and raring to go.'

Secretary Clinton is looking forward to returning to her Washington office next week, though no date of arrival was specified. For the time being, doctors have advised Clinton to avoid international travel.

Support: Holding tightly to her daughter's hand, the secretary of state exited the hospital on Wednesday afternoon. Her spokesman confirmed she was discharged this evening

The Secretary of State is already resuming some of her duties and is in 
contact with her staff in the Beltway as she recuperates at the Clinton home in Chappaqua, New York.

'She's looking forward to getting back to the office,' Nuland said at a press briefing on Thursday. 'She is very much planning to do so next week.'

During the press call, the spokesman also said that Clinton plans 'at some point' to appear before Congress to testify on the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.

'She is committed to testifying, and we are working with the committees on an appropriate set of dates,' Nuland said.

The Secretary of State's illness has prevented her from appearing before the committee in Washington, which was become a point of contention among detractors.

As Clinton recuperates, her family has been on hand to offer support. 

Her daughter Chelsea assured 
supporters late on Wednesday that her mother was on the road to recovery
 and would soon bounce back to her normal schedule.

On Wednesday, a
 beaming Bill Clinton and a smiling Chelsea emerged with the family 
matriarch outside the Manhattan hospital, which marked Hillary Clinton's
 first public appearance since December 7.

Finally leaving: Hillary Clinton was alone in the car with her security team when she finally left New York-Presbyterian Hospital after being formally discharged on Wednesday

Rest: The Secretary of State is expected to make a full recovery and will rest at home while doing so

Secretary Clinton, dressed in a dark 
fur-lined coat and sunglasses, held tightly to her daughter's hand as 
she walked down the steps outside the hospital on West 168th Street in 
Manhattan yesterday.

Wearing a black puffy coat to brave 
the chilly New York temperatures, Chelsea appeared self-assured as her 
mother leaned on her for support.

There was initially confusion on Wednesday afternoon about whether 
Secretary Clinton's appearance outside the hospital meant that she had been discharged but later in the evening, the Clinton's daughter confirmed that her mother had indeed been released. 

'Grateful my Mom discharged from the 
hospital & is heading home. Even more grateful her medical team 
confident she'll make a full recovery,' she tweeted.

'Thank
 you to the doctors, nurses & staff at New York Presbyterian 
Hospital Columbia University Medical Center for taking great care of my 
Mom.'

After the family's 
appearance Wednesday afternoon, Secretary Clinton was driven to a medical facility across 
the street where she is believed to have undergone various medical 
tests. She returned to the hospital a half hour later and then 
later on Wednesday was driven alone from the hospital

It is thought that Clinton is recovering at the 
family's house in the upscale New York suburb of Chappaqua.

Recovering: Hillary Clinton was driven 
to a medical facility across the street from the hospital on Wednesday for tests and then officially discharged

Back to work: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton grins widely as she is driven away from New York-Presbyterian Hospital. She is already actively engaging with her staff, a spokesperson said

The Clintons
 bought the home, located only a 40-minute drive outside of Manhattan, 
in 1999 and have used it as their primary residence for much of the last
 decade.

Local media in the quiet community reported that police were attempting to keep the press away from the sprawling home.

A New Castle Police Officer said that
 members of the media are not allowed to park on the road that leads to 
the Clinton home, according to the Chappaqua-Mount Kisco Patch.

'Please let her recover as quickly as possible but without paparazzi,' one local resident Nora Mackenzie commented on the local news website.

A State Department spokesman had said on Wednesday that Clinton was already getting back to work on paperwork and was engaging with her staff in Washington, who have been charged with handling U.S. foreign policy in her absence. 

'She's been quite active on the phone with all of us,' State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said, adding that she has been in regular phone contact with her foreign counterparts.

A-okay: Former President Bill Clinton grins as he leaves New York-Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday just hours before his wife Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was formally discharged

Home to rest: The Clintons purchased this home in the New York suburb of Chappaqua in 1999 for $1.7million

Her short public appearance on 
Wednesday seemed to signal that she was ready to get back to work 
following an unspecified recovery period, though some detractors 
suggested her health condition could keep her out of the running for a 
rumored presidential bid in 2016.

Others
 scoffed that perhaps the outgoing Secretary of State was using her 
health scare to avoid facing a Congressional inquiry on State Department 
security failures in the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in 
Benghazi.

She was admitted to the hospital on Sunday after an MRI revealed the
 clot. According to BuzzFeed, a hospital source said that she received treatment in a VIP wing on the hospital's ninth floor.

Her doctors announced that she was 
being treated for the condition on Monday, causing alarm over the 
secretary's health following a concussion she suffered from a fall on 
December 9. 

In the 
Monday statement, Dr. Lisa Bardack, of the Mt. Kisco Medical Group, and 
Dr. Gigi El-Bayoumi, from George Washington University, said the clot 
'did not result in a stroke, or neurological damage.'

Despite
 the assurances, people became alarmed when a photo emerged of Chelsea Clinton looking distraught and anxious as she visited her mother at 
the hospital on Monday.

Early on: Chelsea Clinton looked distressed on Monday while visiting her mother (pictured) but by Wednesday the 32-year-old appeared more upbeat as she supported her mother

Chelsea, who is married to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky and lives in the Madison Square Park neighborhood of Manhattan, is extremely close to her family.

In a Vogue profile of Chelsea, who entered the limelight in 1993 when her father became president, a friend of the Clinton's only child said the loss of her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Rodham, last year came as a devastating blow.

Her childhood friend, Nicole Fox, said in August 2012 that death of her mother's mother 'was the hardest thing I’ve ever seen Chelsea 
go through. She was really destroyed by it.'

But after the pained expression on Monday, Chelsea Clinton displayed more optimism in a New Year's Day message.

'Wishing
 all a healthy & happy 2013,' Chelsea Clinton tweeted on Tuesday. 
'Grateful to be starting the new year with my family.'

Relief: Chelsea tweeted that her mother was formally discharged on Wednesday evening

Health scare: Hillary Clinton's doctors discovered the clot during a follow-up exam on Sunday and confirmed it was in her head on Monday

Clinton also thanked the public via Twitter for their support for her mother.

'Thank you to all for sending good thoughts my Mom's way,' she wrote. 
'Grateful to all her doctors & that she'll make a full recovery!'

Chelsea Clinton has always enjoyed a close relationship with her parents and is increasingly becoming a political force in her own right.

She was a fixture during her mother's bid for the Democratic  presidential nomination in 2008 and has not been shying away from the spotlight with speaking engagements, her gig as a correspondent for NBC and her political advocacy for LGBT issues.

But for now, the poised and glamorous scholar is committed to being by her mother's side.

Grateful: Chelsea tweeted from her mother's bedside on New Year's Day

Optimism: Chelsea also thanked the public via Twitter for their support while her mother is hospitalized

Former President Bill Clinton had also been spotted driving to and from his 
wife's side at New York-Presbyterian Hospital during his wife's stay at the hospital.

In
 the Monday statement announcing Clinton's condition, doctors assured 
the public that it was not a life-threatening condition and said she had
 suffered no brain damage or stroke.

'In all other aspects of her recovery, the Secretary is making 
excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery. 
She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her 
staff,' Doctors Lisa Bardack and Gigi El-Bayoumi said in a statement.

A clot occurs when a blockage builds 
up, either from partial thrombus (coagulated blood) or an outside 
compression. When the vein becomes blocked, the coagulated blood may 
extend to veins draining the area, which could lead to a lack of oxygen 
and tissue death.

The condition was discovered during an MRI but leading up to the discovery.
