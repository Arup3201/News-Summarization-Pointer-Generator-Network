A student suffered horrific burns after he was forced to peel his arm off a searing-hot radiator which he had fallen asleep against when he was drunk. 

The 21-year-old, who did not want to be named, said he had come home after a night out in Plymouth in Devon and decided to take a nap against the radiator, which he said was cold at the time.

But the third year engineering student at Plymouth University soon found himself in hospital and on an IV drip after he suffered severe burns when he woke up with his arm stuck to the hot radiator.

A 21-year-old student was left with horrific burns (left) and scars (right) after he drunkenly fell asleep against a radiator after a night out, and woke up at his home in Plymouth to find he had been stuck to the hot radiator 

He still has scars from the incident and was also given antibiotics to treat his arm. 

'It all started when I was out at the Christmas party for a gay pub I used to work at,' he said. 

'The vodka and beers were flying everywhere and I took it a bit far.

'When I came back I was hammered and I fell asleep against the radiator which was cold at the time.

'I woke up a few hours later when the radiator was steaming hot.

'I thought "Jesus, my arm's stuck on a radiator, what am I going to do?" I had to peel myself off. It really hurt.'

The third year engineering student burnt himself using a UV lamp he mistook for a heater just days later 

The student immediately took himself to hospital where doctors put him on a drip because they were concerned about his circulation in the burned arm. 

He received specialist burn treatment.

He added: 'They gave me a special burn cream, painkillers and even antibiotics. I didn't take those in the end.

'It looked really nasty. My friends have been asking me if I'm okay and if I need any aloe vera.' 

And it appeared the student had failed to learn his lesson as just days later he managed to burn himself again, this time on a UV lamp that he had mistook for a heater at his student house.
