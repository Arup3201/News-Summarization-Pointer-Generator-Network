Guilty: Danilo Restivo has been given life in prison for killing Heather Barnett - and could also be extradited back to Italy

The hair fetishist who murdered and mutilated a mother of two in her home was given a ‘whole life’ jail sentence yesterday.

Passing sentence at Winchester Crown Court, Mr Justice Burnett warned 39-year-old Danilo  Restivo: ‘You will never be released from prison.’

The Italian was found guilty on Wednesday of the murder of neighbour Heather Barnett, 48, in Bournemouth in 2002.

He had bludgeoned her with a hammer before cutting her throat and mutilating her body.

He left a clump of someone else’s hair in her right hand and left the body for Mrs Barnett’s children, Caitlin, then 11, and Terry, then 14, to find in the bathroom.

Restivo was also linked during his trial to the murder of 16-year-old Elisa Claps in Italy in 1993, who was killed in a similar way. He is expected to be extradited to Italy to stand trial for Elisa’s murder.

Restivo showed no emotion as he heard the sentence.

A victim impact statement was read on behalf of Mrs Barnett’s daughter, Caitlin, 19, who described the ‘horror’ of finding her mother’s body and being told by police that she was dead.

She said: ‘It was at that moment that I felt as if my heart had been ripped out.

‘I was in a state of complete and utter shock and it took months before I accepted the truth.

All
12 members of the jury chose to return to Winchester Crown Court this 
morning to hear Restivo's sentence. Some of them had wept when hearing 
evidence read on behalf of Mrs Barnett's daughter and sister.

Mr Justice Burnett told 'butcher' Restivo the murder was so serious that no minimum term would be appropriate.

'The seriousness of this offence is exceptionally high - namely the depravity of the killing, the careful planning and preparation, its sexual content and the previous killing of Elisa Claps - drive me to the conclusion that the alternative starting point (for a minimum prison term) of 30 years would not be appropriate.

'I can find no mitigation in this case, none have been advanced on your behalf.

'There is, in my judgement, no minimum period which could be properly set - you will never be released from prison.'

Mr Burnett described the crime as of 'inhuman depravity', made worse by the fact that Restivo would have known his victim's children would find Mrs Barnett's body.

He said: "You knew an 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy would find their mother butchered on the bathroom floor.

'This feature of the case will haunt those who sat through it.

'Why you picked Heather Barnett as your victim I do not know, but it's clear that you did so to satisfy a sadistic, sexual appetite.

'The evidence in this case shows you are a cold, depraved, calculated killer.'

Yesterday the victim’s daughter, Caitlin, who was 11 at the time, sobbed as Restivo was convicted.

Now the Daily Mail can reveal that the Italian is also suspected of killing a student exactly four months earlier.

Restivo killed Mrs Barnett in Bournemouth on November 12, 2002, and police believe he chose to kill on the 12th of each month.

Elisa Claps, who was 16, vanished on September
12, 1993, after arranging to meet Restivo at a church in Potenza, south
Italy. Her body was found in the loft only in March last year.

Restivo 
fled to Bournemouth in 2002 after being convicted of lying to police 
about an injury to his hand on the day she vanished.

He is now feared to have carried out a
third murder, that of a foreign student who died just three streets away from
his home, which he shared with his wife, Fiamma Marsango, 54, whom he 
met online.

Fetish: The court heard how Restivo enjoyed cutting women's hair

The trial of Danilo Restivo heard that the murderer had a fetish for cutting women's hair.

Michael
Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the jury Restivo was responsible for 
cutting hair from 15 women or girls while travelling by bus in the 
Bournemouth area.

This fetish, known as trichophilia, is when someone gets sexually aroused by human hair.

The
court heard that a number of women had contacted police after their 
hair had been cut while travelling on buses in the Dorset area.

They
included a woman called Tessa Cox, who saw a male passenger lean towards a 
female passenger and cut her hair with scissors and got off the bus when
he realised he was being observed, the court heard.

The
girl whose hair was cut did not want to report it to police but on 
February 7, 2008, Ms Cox was working at Bournemouth Hospital when she 
recognised Restivo in a ward bed and contacted police.

In
another incident, in late 2002, a schoolgirl called Katie McGoldrick 
was on a bus when she felt her hair pulled and a man she described as 
Italian or Arabic was sat behind her with his face very close to her 
head.

She later noticed her hair had been cut and in June 2004 she identified Restivo in a police identification procedure.

Restivo
is also accused of cutting another woman's hair while he sat behind her
in a cinema in Potenza, Italy, the city where he used to live and where
teenager Elisa Claps was killed.

Angela Campochiaro, 23, was at a cinema in Potenza with her then fiance Nicola Marino in 1992, the court was told.

During the film, Ms Campochiaro realised that a man behind her was touching her hair and had cut about 10cm off.

She
told Mr Marino who turned around and saw that the perpetrator, who he 
recognised as Restivo, had his genitals exposed and had been 
masturbating, the court heard.

Jong-Ok Shin, 26, was killed on July 
12 and a clump of hair was found near her body.

The South Korean was 
stabbed three times in the back as she walked home in Charminster, Bournemouth, after a night out.

Omar Benguit, 31, was convicted of her murder in February 2005. Now his 
lawyers are appealing.

Last night Dorset Police were facing
questions about why the force took nine years to bring Restivo to 
justice.

Italian officers had made contact in 2002 to alert the force to 
suspicions that Restivo was involved in Miss Claps’s disappearance.

Restivo lived just 50 yards away from
Mrs Barnett and had visited her six days before the murder to ask 
about having curtains made. She had told her sister, Denise Le 
Voir, she felt ‘concerned, hassled and distressed’ after Restivo stole 
her house keys.

Restivo falsified alibis on the day 
of the murder – first buying a bus ticket during the morning and later 
altering log-in records at his place of study.

In another bizarre link 
between the cases, jurors heard that 15 women had reported their hair 
being cut on buses and in a cinema in Bournemouth and also in Potenza 
around the time of the murders in 2002 and 1993.

Restivo was charged with the murder 
in May last year.

Yesterday Mrs Le Voir said: ‘We see ourselves as 
survivors, not victims ... and look forward to continuing our lives safe
in the knowledge this man will be in jail for many years.’

Detective Superintendent Mark Cooper, of Dorset Police, described Restivo as a ‘dangerous predator’.

‘Despite his guilt, Restivo never 
moved away from his house that looked out on to Heather’s property and, 
perhaps most chilling of all, he even consoled her two children the 
afternoon following his cold and calculated actions.’

He has also been linked in Italy to four other killings.
