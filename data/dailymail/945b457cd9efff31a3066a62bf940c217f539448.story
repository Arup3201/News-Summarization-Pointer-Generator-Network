Thierry Henry believes Barcelona new boy Luis Suarez is the best out and out striker in world football.

La Liga giants Barcelona have forked out £75million to land the Uruguayan international despite the fact he has to serve a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini.

However Henry believes Suarez is worth the money as he is - in the Frenchman's opinion - the best goalscorer in world football when you take Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo out of the equation.

Honest: Henry doesn't sit on the fence when he is asked some tough questions by Ferdinand

Henry, speaking in an exclusive interview with Rio Ferdinand's #5 magazine, said on Suarez: 'If we are talking about strikers - not guys who score a lot of goals from anywhere - then I would say the best in the world is Luis Suarez.

'He has everything. He's in your face, he's arrogant in a good way, he can volley it, he can score headers.

'He has that vicious side to his game. I will not call it cheating. He knows how to score goals. We have seen it against England. They gave him two chances and he scored two goals.'

Henry has also had his say on the everlasting debate regarding Ronaldo and Messi.

Current New York Red Bulls captain Henry has revealed he thinks his former Barcelona teammate is the better player because he is 'naturally gifted'.

'Lionel Messi is the best player in the world but I respect the amount of work Cristiano Ronaldo has put into the game,' added Henry.

'But Messi is just a freak. It is nice for kids to watch as they can see one guy who was given a gift and the other guy who does it through hard work.

'Louis Saha used to tell me he was the hardest worker at Manchester United. I am not saying Messi does not work hard - but it is more natural.

'Ronaldo had to work really hard to reach the top. They have the same mentality but that's the difference.'
