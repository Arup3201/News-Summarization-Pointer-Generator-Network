There was a time when no childhood was complete without experiencing the fizzy-pop explosion of a Mento dropped into a bottle of Diet Coke.

The liquid would erupt into a fountain of brown froth, spewing soft drink in all directions as it reacted violently with the chewy sweet.

But what happens when you dress a grown man from head to toe in Mentos and drop him into a giant vat of Diet Coke?

They're not Mento for that! The stunt, created by makers of YouTube channel Epic Meal Time to promote their upcoming TV show, shows an apparently willing participant in the 'Mento suit' smile nervously for the camera before donning a scuba mask and snorkel

This group of Canadian pranksters couldn't wait to find out after spending hours painstakingly creating a 'Mento suit' and stocking up on bottles of coke.

The stunt, created by makers of YouTube channel Epic Meal Time to promote their upcoming TV show, begins with an apparently willing participant in the 'Mento suit' smiling nervously for the camera before donning a scuba mask and snorkel.

He is next seen perching precariously on a chair balanced above the tank of dark liquid.

Suddenly a tennis ball flies into shot and hits a switch, sending him into the drink with explosive effect. A powerful reaction ensues as foam shoots in all directions.

The fate of the testee remains unclear, as he is seen thrashing about in the sugary liquid before the video abruptly ends.

High pressure: The reaction is caused by a process called nucleation, whereby the carbon dioxide in the soda is attracted to dozens of tiny pores on the surface of the Mentos, causing so much pressure that the soda erupts

Any carbonated beverage will produce a similar effect, but Diet Coke became the most popular after it was found to produce the best results.

In 2006, TV show MythBusters concluded that the potassium benzoate, aspartame, and CO2 gas contained in the Diet Coke, in combination with the gelatin and gum arabic ingredients of the Mentos, all contribute to the formation of the foam.

Although some scientists claim it is not a chemical reaction, rather a purely physical one.

However, the makers' decision to use fruit Mentos instead of mint ones caused some controversy online.

Gawker journalist Jay Hathaway wrote: 'Fruit Mentos are more eye-catching, but they have an outer coating that seals in the CO2 and makes the reaction less explosive.

'The more porous mint Mentos, while less tasty, will give you more bang for your buck.'

The reaction is believed to be a result of nucleation, whereby pores on Mentos catalyze the release of carbon dioxide in the Diet Coke
