Haunting and beautiful, the work of poets such as Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen continues to fascinate almost 100 years after the war began.

But while Owen's vivid images of suffering in the trenches still strike a chord today, not every war poet is remembered quite so well.

Now those poets, among them dashing Julian Grenfell and the gentle, nature-loving Edward Thomas, are to star in a new book that brings their work back to life.

Dashing: Julian Grenfell (inset) wrote Into Battle, a poem that finally made it into print after his death in 1915

In his new book, Some Desperate Glory, historian Max Egremont tells the stories of these half-forgotten poets - many of whom offered a take on war that couldn't have been more different from the miserablist approach taken by Owen.

One who certainly didn't was Julian Grenfell, a glamorous Oxford-educated sportsman who served in the Royal Dragoons, a cavalry regiment.

Arriving in France with the first cohort of British soldiers to go into battle, Grenfell was pleased to be there.

'French and Belgian civilians cheered Grenfell and his men, making him think that the locals were "wonderful",' writes Egremont.

'At first he felt lost in the fog of marching and counter-marching where "only the virtue of the Christian faith emerges triumphant". But "it is all the most wonderful fun; better fun than anyone can imagine. I hope it goes on for a long time".'

Early days: British troops, Grenfell among them, were cheered by civilians when they first arrived

Hard: Despite the setbacks of Mons (pictured) and the Marne, Grenfell never lost his taste for fighting

He later wrote that he 'adored war', describing it as a 'big picnic but without the objectiveness of a picnic'.

But letters weren't all that he was writing. While serving in the British Army during the battles of the Marne, Mons and Ypres, Grenfell was also writing poetry.

Unsurprisingly, Grenfell's work glories in the dirty business of fighting, describing the exhilaration of streaming over the top of the trenches and running at the German lines.

His most famous work, Into Battle, was even published in the Times the year it was written. Sadly for Grenfell, however, he wasn't alive to see it.

Fighting in the second battle of Ypres, he was hit in the head by a splinter from a shell and died of his wounds 13 days later. He was just 27 years old.

Gentle: Edward Thomas was 39 when he was killed at Arras while serving with the Royal Garrison Artillery

Brave: Thomas signed up after being sent a mocking poem by his friend, American poet Robert Frost

Unlike the more famous names who would follow him into the annals of poetry as the war continued, Grenfell never became disillusioned with war.

Fellow poet Edward Thomas, however, never really wanted to be there at all, only signing up after being sent a mocking poem by his friend, the American poet Robert Frost.

Thomas, a grammar-school educated writer, couldn't have been more different from the aristocratic Grenfell.

A gentle man with a passion for nature, he spent most of his life in the Kent, then Gloucestershire countryside, where he lived with his wife Helen and three children.

When war broke out, Thomas, then aged 36, could have avoided the draft but eventually joined the Royal Garrison Artillery in November 1916.

By early 1917, Thomas was in France and serving with his unit near Arras. While he was there, he composed his heartbreaking piece, In Memoriam, a four-line poem that movingly decried the loss of millions of young men.

Sadly, Thomas would become one of them. On the 9th April 1917, he was killed by the concussive blast of one of the last shells fired during the Battle of Arras. He was just 39 years old.
