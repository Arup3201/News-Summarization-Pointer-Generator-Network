It is the end product of the most expensive weapons programme in U.S. history, set back by glitches and overspending, but today marked the first time an F-35C fighter landed on a carrier ship.

This video shows the F-35C Lightning II stealth fighter, which has cost the government nearly $400billion so far, touching down on the deck of the USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego.

The operation is being hailed by the Pentagon as a major step forward in the race to get the aircraft operational, after the entire American fleet was grounded earlier this year following an engine fire.

This is the moment the F-35C fighter landed on the deck of the USS Nimitz for the first time, hailed by the pentagon as a 'landmark moment' in developing the aircraft

The fighter has cost $400billion to develop - the largest weapons programme in U.S. military history - and has been hampered by engine problems and overspending

The plane landed using the tailhook system - a large metal hook which grapples on to a cable laid across the carrier's deck - which has had to be redesigned several times due to problems in development

The F-35 will form the backbone of the US airforce once it is operational, and will also be bought by NATO allies including the UK, Italy, Australia, Canada and Turkey.

There are three variants - the standard F-35A, designed for conventional takeoff, the F-35B for short take off and vertical landing, and the F-35C which is designed for use on carriers.

Aircrew: One

Max speed: 1.6Mach (1,217.3mph)

Length: 51ft

Wingspan: 35ft

Max. altitude: 50,000ft 

Today marks the first time an F-35C has been landed on a carrier using the tail-hook system, where a large metal hook hanging from the back of the aircraft snags on a cable laid across the deck of the carrier, slowing it down very quickly.

Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 joint program office, said the landing was part of a two-week sea-based test that runs until November 17.  

The sea testing of the plane will give officials key data about the ship's performance on a carrier, and allow any adjustments needed to keep the program on track for initial use by the fleet in 2018.

The latest exercises are part of an extensive array of sea tests as the aircraft enters the final phase of its development ahead of an expected 2018 deployment

In video footage the plane can be seen using a tail-hook to land - grappling on to a wire laid across the deck

The F-35 has three variants - the F-35A, designed for conventional runway takeoff, the F-35B, designed for short landing and vertical takeoff, and the F-35C, designed for use on aircraft carriers

Navy test pilot Commander Tony Wilson, who landed the CF-03 aircraft on the Nimitz flight deck just after noon, called it a 'landmark event.'

Vice Admiral David Buss, commander of Naval Air Forces, said the landing was 'historic,' noting that it begins 'the integration of the next generation of warfighting capability into our carrier-based wings.'

The jet, and a second due to arrive later Monday or Tuesday, will carry out two weeks of testing at sea, the first of three testing phases planned for the carrier variant of the F-35.

The jets will perform operational manoeuvres, including various catapult takeoffs and arrested landings using a tailhook that had be redesigned after early test problems on land.

The F-35 and its two variants will form the backbone of the U.S. airforce, while NATO partners such as the UK, Canada, Turkey and Italy also expected to buy the aircraft

The fighter is designed to be invisible to radar and can travel at up to 1.6Mach, more than one and a half times the speed of sound 

The entire fleet of American planes had to be grounded earlier this year following the discovery of a cracked rotor blade in one of the engines, and an engine fire

Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the program for the Pentagon, said the Navy, Pentagon and contractors had been preparing for the testing for months.

The high-tech fighter allows the pilot to fly at up to 1.6 times the speed of sound while being completely invisible to radar.

The fighter's helmet contains a display which maps the battlefield below and will even map underneath the plane - allowing the pilot to effectively see through the floor.

Graphics projected directly onto the visor inside the helmet give a 360-degree view, with icons representing threats and friendly forces for miles around the aircraft.

Two touchscreens display all of the pilot's information, and allow him to immediately share data with commanders at sea, in the air or on the ground.

The jet, and a second due to arrive later Monday or Tuesday, will carry out two weeks of testing at sea, the first of three testing phases
