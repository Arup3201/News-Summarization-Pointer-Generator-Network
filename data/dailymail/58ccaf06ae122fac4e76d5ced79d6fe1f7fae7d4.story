Alec Baldwin's stalker Genevieve Sabourin claimed today that she was forced to sleep on excrement-smeared floors during the first days of her sentence for harassing the actor.

The French-Canadian alleged that she had suffered a 'heart attack' at Rikers Island in New York and was billed for medication because as a non-U.S. citizen, she doesn't qualify for Medicare.

Last week, Sabourin, 41, was found guilty of aggravated harassment, stalking and attempted criminal contempt among 23 other counts. She was sentenced to 210 days in total behind bars.

In a short interview from jail on Thursday, wearing her green prison jumpsuit, the bit-part actress told the New York Post: 'I have slept on the floor for three days.
 It was covered in excrement. I had a heart attack.'

Since being taken off from court in handcuffs last week, Sabourin has been held at Central Booking, the Tombs and now Rikers. She did not make clear where the 'excrement' was on the floor.

The City of New York Department of Correction was not immediately available for comment when called by MailOnline.Â 

Sabourin, who is due to appear in court on Friday, is scheduled to be released from prison March 30, 2014.

She is serving six months for stalking and harassing Baldwin and his wife Hilaria.

She was given an additional month for contempt of court after shouting out 'You're lying' while Baldwin took the stand during her trial to testify that he had not slept with her.
