Mark your calendars! It's a September wedding for George Clooney and his bride-to-be Amal Alamuddin.

The couple, who were introduced at a charity event last September, are planning on making the one-year anniversary of their first meeting their wedding day.

‘If all goes as they are planning, Amal and George will be husband and wife within less than five months,’ reveals a family friend.

Clooney turned 53 on May 6, and he’s given himself quite the gift — an entirely different life. The actor shocked the world when he reversed gears on his long-standing ban on marriage and got engaged to Beirut-born lawyer, Amal.

Not long to wait: It's a September wedding for George Clooney (L) and his bride-to-be Amal Alamuddin (R), who were introduced at a charity event last September

New life: The actor shocked the world when he reversed gears on his long-standing ban on marriage and got engaged to the Beirut-born lawyer

Now. the longtime family friend of the traditional family reveals exclusively to MailOnline the details behind the happy couple’s journey from the single life to falling in love and, in five months, to wedded bliss.

George had to go through a vigorous vetting before Amal would even consent to go out with him last fall. ‘He asked her out three times before she finally agreed,’ says the friend.

‘Tradition is extremely important to her Lebanese family, so Amal contacted her parents to discuss it before she would agree to go out with him.'

According to the pal, letting her family know that she was going to date George was Amal’s way of showing them respect. And George had to do the same once he decided he was finally ready to take their relationship to the next level.

Family affair: Amal's mother Baria Alamuddin (in white, standing at the back), father Ramzi K.Alamuddin (sitting in front of her on the sofa) and other family members are thrilled for Amal and George. Amal is believed to be the baby being held by her grandmother

Seal of approval: A longtime friend tells MailOnline that George had to go through a vigorous vetting process before Amal's dad Ramzi and mom Baria before the 36-year-old lawyer would even consent to go out with him. Tradition is very important to the Lebanese family

Before asking for Amal’s hand in marriage with a 7-carat emerald-cut diamond, George and the international law and human rights attorney flew to Dubai for a few days in March to meet up with her half-brothers brothers, Samer and Ziad, sister, Tala, and father, Ramzi.

The friend reveals that George met 36-year-old Amal’s London-based editor mother, Baria, more times than her dad, the retired owner of a travel agency called Cosmo.

MailOnline had reported exclusively that the dashing Hollywood star was been notably absent during the pre-Oscar bashes around Los Angeles and skipped the after-parties on March 2. He was on his way to London to meet up with Amal and then fly on to Dubai.

‘That trip was kind of Clooney’s indirect way of showing her father he was serious about her before asking for her hand in marriage.’

According to the friend, during their March trip George proved that he was more than just a good-looking movie star.

‘Amal’s dad is definitely more impressed with Clooney’s political and humanitarian involvement than he is with his fame and wealth,’ the friend notes to MailOnline.

‘Ramzi prefers his daughter is associated with a guy with brains and no money over a guy with no brains and lots of money.’

Three's a charm: George had to ask the Lebanese beauty out on a date three times before she said yes. Now she's sporting a 7-carat emerald cut diamond that George helped design on her left hand

Amal and George played their relationship right with the family, but they did make one major faux pas. 'He wanted his proposal to be a surprise so he told very few people,’ reveals the friend.

George got down on one knee to pop the question to Amal at a romantic restaurant on April 22.The brunette stunner showed the gem off alongside the actor at his friend Rande Gerber's 52nd birthday dinner in Santa Barbara on April 27.

Unfortunately, ‘the family learned Amal was engaged from the press, and her brothers and sister also didn't learn about it until later,' the friend added. 

The family is willing to overlook the slight, says the friend.

But there is one major unresolved issue about the Big Day.

Scene of the wedding: Will George and Amal say 'I do' in Amal's tranquil village of Baaqlin? Or will the couple choose New York or London for their nuptials? George wants a low-key affair but Amal's family has something else in mind

‘George doesn’t want a huge to-do, but what he doesn’t really understand yet is that a “small” wedding for a Lebanese family is around 200 people,’ laughs the friend.

‘I think they will end up having a smaller wedding than Amal’s family expects and that will make a lot of the Lebanese relatives unhappy.’

If the couple decides to hold the wedding in the U.S. or in England, ‘George better have a fleet of private jets ready to fly all the relatives who are expecting to be invited,’ says the friend.

Amal’s parents and siblings ‘just want her to be happy and right now is the happiest they’ve ever seen her.’

Actor pal and Monuments Men co-star Matt Damon adds: 'I'm just thrilled that he met Amal and that they're as happy as they are, He deserves it.'
