Heading the flotilla would be a return to the position of nautical leadership Prince Charles first held in command of the Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Bronington in 1976

Prince Charles is planning to sail ahead of the Queen in a separate boat at the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant – heading a mini-Royal armada.

He wants to lead the 1,000-vessel parade on the newly built Royal Rowboat Gloriana, a cross between a giant gondola and a Viking longboat.

There is even speculation that Prince William and Kate, as well as Prince Harry, could be on a third vessel of their own.

It had originally been hoped that the Queen would sail on the £500,000 gilded Gloriana – which was commissioned as a gift for her from P&O president Lord Sterling of Plaistow.

But the vessel is not big enough to accommodate her security staff and other members of the Royal Family.

Instead, the Queen and Prince Philip will be on board the Royal Barge, Spirit of Chartwell, a luxurious cruiser that is being customised in 17th century style for the occasion.

The Duchess of Cornwall, who  is not comfortable on the water, is likely to join Her Majesty for the pageant along the Thames in London on Sunday, June 3.

Prince Charles discussed the plans at a meeting last Wednesday with the Thames Diamond Jubilee Foundation’s chairman Lord Salisbury and its chief executive, Michael Lockett.

The 63-year-old heir to the throne came up with the idea for a river  pageant four years ago.

He is said to be keen to push ahead with his plan to use the hand-built Gloriana if organisers and Royal security officers agree.

Heading the flotilla would be a 
return to the position of nautical  leadership he first held in command 
of the Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Bronington in 1976.

Gloriana has been granted the Queen’s 
official Royal status. Powered by 18 oarsmen, it also has two engines 
which can be used as an alternative, and comes equipped with flushing  
toilets and hot and cold running water. 

It has a capacity of 50 passengers and will be helmed by the Queen’s Bargemaster.

Royal Watermen will row the boat the 
seven miles along the Thames from Putney to Tower Bridge in a spectacle 
expected to  surpass the floating pageant in 1662 that celebrated the 
restoration of Charles II to the Throne.

Earlier this month, Lord Sterling told how Prince Charles had come up with the idea of giving Gloriana to the Queen four years ago.

The Tory peer said: ‘He asked me to come up with a few thoughts on an appropriate boat. That’s when I had this idea.’

A senior Royal aide told The Mail  on Sunday: ‘The plans for the pageant are still being worked on, but Prince Charles may well end up on his own boat. It is one idea being discussed.’

Organisers are said to be in favour of splitting up the Royals on to two vessels in order to add to the spectacle of the occasion.

‘Everything has to be passed by the Queen for her approval,’ an aide said last night.

‘It’s likely that most family members will be on Spirit of Chartwell.’

However, the likelihood of William, Kate and Harry sailing on their own barge has been downplayed, as it is said to be unlikely courtiers would want attention further diverted from the Queen.

A spokesman for the pageant said: ‘We can confirm that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be on the Royal Barge.

'We will be able to release details of other members of the Royal Family closer to the time.’

Soundtrack: The flotilla will be divided into 10 sections with music herald barges separating each group, playing music composed especially for the event, including church bells, herald fanfare trumpeters and an orchestra from the Academy of Ancient Music

The 1,000-boat tribute will feature vessels from down the centuries on the River Thames, a seven-mile long procession of Dunkirk little ships, historic vessels, steam boats and tugs, rowed shallops and Dutch barges and passenger ships
