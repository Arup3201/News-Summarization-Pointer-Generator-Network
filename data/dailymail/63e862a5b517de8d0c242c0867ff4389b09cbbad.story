Twin brothers will both serve as sheriffs for two adjacent counties in western Washington state later this year.

Incumbent John Snaza held on to his position as Thurston County Sheriff in last week's election - and Rob Snaza was voted Lewis County Sheriff for the first time, Q13Fox reported.

'It's pretty awesome,' Rob Snaza said in a joint interview with his brother to the affiliate station. 'It's kind of a humbling experience for us.'

'It's pretty surreal still, it hasn't really settled in,' he also said.

John Snaza was convinced to enter law enforcement after he participated in a ridealong with his identical younger brother, Q13Fox reported.

'I had the time of my life and so it was like I got hooked,' he told the affiliate station.

Speaking about jointly responding to DUIs, he also said 'It would probably throw some people off because they would look at me, look at him, look at me, you know, and probably judge their own sobriety at that time. So, we had some fun with that.'

John Snaza became Thurston County Sheriff in 2010 and is fourteen minutes older than Rob Snaza, the news outlet reported.

'We grew up in Thurston and our parents grew up in Lewis,' the elder Snaza told Q13Fox. 'And we get to be part of all that community? And just - and just be - embrace it and show everybody that - what we can do, what we're capable of doing and how much we really care.'

Rob Snaza will officially work as Lewis County Sheriff in December, and told the affiliate station 'The one thing we have together is the ability that we get to share our ideas, we get to share our stories, we get to share our concerns.'

John Snaza then said 'What a ride. You know, you get your brother to get to be a sheriff. He's the one that got me into it.

'And you know, how cool it is to have an opportunity to work side by side with your own brother and to serve both communities that we grew up in.'
