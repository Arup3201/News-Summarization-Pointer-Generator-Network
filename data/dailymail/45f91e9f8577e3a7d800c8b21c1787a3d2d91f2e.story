For three weeks, Samsung has been fending off claims from Apple that it has ripped off various patents - but it’s now hitting back.

During the ongoing, high-profile court battle between the two tech giants, the Korean firm claimed Apple's FaceTime feature infringes one of its own patents.

The Galaxy smartphone maker is demanding $6 million (£3.6 million) as a result of the alleged infringement and is mounting its own case for damages to counter Apple’s numerous accusations.

Samsung claims Apple's FaceTime, pictured, which lets users make video calls over an web connection, infringes a Samsung patent regarding the compression of video before transmission over a mobile network, awarded in 1994. Apple's lawyers claim the technology described in the patent is now obsolete

The $2 billion court case began on 
March 31. Apple is accusing rival Samsung of infringing a number of 
software patents on the iPhone.

It is the latest battle between the two firms dating back to 2010.

Apple began by suing Samsung, but the Korean firm counter-sued just 
days later.

Apple then secured an injunction to restrict sales of 
Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Europe.

In
 July 2012, another court battle led to Apple publicly stating Samsung 
didn’t copy its designs, but in August 2012 Apple was awarded $1 billion 
in damages.

However, the damages paid by Samsung were dropped from $1 billion (£593
 million) to around $800 million (£475 million).

In June 2013, 
the International Trade Commission ruled iPads infringed on Samsung 
patents and the products should be banned in the U.S.

This ruling was vetoed two months later when ITC blocked older Samsung phones.

A retrial began in November last year and Apple won, but Samsung appealed.

The trial between the two technology giants is now into its fourth week, and began with Apple seeking $2 billion (£1.1 billion) from Samsung over claims it infringed a number of Apple-filed patents in its range of products.

After three weeks of defence, Samsung claimed Apple's FaceTime app - which lets users make video calls via a web connection - infringes a Samsung patent regarding the compression of video before transmission over a mobile network.

The court heard the patent was awarded to Samsung in 1994 and the idea was considered ‘revolutionary’ at the time.

Apple's lawyers, however, claim the technology described in the patent is now obsolete. 

The court case began on 
March 31.

This latest patent war between the two technology giants surrounds a lawsuit brought by Apple over five separate patent infringements, including the ‘slide to unlock’ feature that is prominent on both Apple and Samsung devices.

Both companies have listed 10 or more products from the other that infringes a patent, and it is the latest in a series of lawsuits between the two firms involving the alleged copying of technology in modern smartphones.

Last month, Samsung used slides taken from an Apple planning meeting to defend some of Apple's claims. 

They were taken from an Apple meeting in April 2013 that plotted the rise in popularity of larger 
screens - such as those in Samsung's Galaxy range - compared to a drop in iPhone growth.
