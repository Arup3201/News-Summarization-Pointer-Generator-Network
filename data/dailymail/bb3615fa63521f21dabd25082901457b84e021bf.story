A 'paranoid schizophrenic' man accused of stabbing two innocent children last week has been taken to Bellevue hospital for psychiatric treatment. He was released from jail just nine days before the alleged stabbing without being given medicine or a psychiatric referral.

Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was taken to Bellevue hospital at 3 a.m this morning after he allegedly stabbed 6-year-old Prince Joshua (P.J.) Avitto to death on Thursday. He also allegedly stabbed P.J.s 12-year-old playmate Mikaya Capers with a steak knife.

Mikayala is still in the hospital but is now out of intensive care and is walking on her own.

The New York Daily News reports that St. Hubert suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and was diagnosed after serving jail time for trying to strangle his mother with an electrical cord.

He was released on May 23 without medicine or a referral for psychiatric treatment.

Nine days later he was accused of stabbing both children in the elevator at Boulevard Houses in East New York, Brooklyn.

St. Hubert's sister Judith Perry said that her brother is eager to clear his name and truly believes that he didn't commit the crime.

'I didn’t do it,' he told his sister.

Perry believes that the police are treating her brother as though he were guilty before his trial  that he told her he was 'abused' by the guards who were transporting him to the hospital.

Daniel St. Hubert, 27, believes he is innocent and 'doesn't understand' why he is being held by law enforcement

Prince Joshua Avitto, 6, was memorialized on Friday at a funeral with over 1,000 attendees

St.Hubert said that the guards who took him to the hospital banged his head against the wall and tightened his handcuffs until they were painful.'His hand is swollen,' Perry said. 'He doesn’t like the situation he’s in. He feels it’s unfair that they are ... judging him guilty without even giving him a fair trial.'

Sharod Jean-Pierre, P.J.'s 21-year-old sister says that taking the suspect to Bellevue doen't bring her brother back her brother nor doers it do anything to quell her pain.'He’s still gonna be able to eat, sleep, talk to people. My little brother isn’t going to be able to do that anymore,' Jean-Pierre, 21, said of the suspected Brooklyn stabber.

'I want him to stay at Rikers. I want him to suffer.'

P.J., nicknamed Superman, had a funeral on Friday and more than 1,000 mourners including Mayor de Blasio, Al Sharption, and P.J.s cousin TaJ Gibson who plays for The Chicago Bulls were in attendance.

Cops believe that St. Hubert may be connected to a few other stabbings in New York in the past few weeks.

Cops think St.Hubert may have killed Tanaya Copeland, 18, who was stabbed just a few blocks away from where the children were stabbed.

Police think St.Hubert might also be responsible for stabbing a 53-year-old homeless man named Kyle Moore who was critically wounded on Wednesday in Chelsea on the Subway at W. 18th street.

The New York Daily News reports that St.Hubert was also sent to mental health facilities in 2010 and 2011.
