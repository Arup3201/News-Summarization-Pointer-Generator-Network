Michael van Gerwen was far from his best as he survived a huge scare from Joe Cullen in the first round of his World Darts Championship defence on Thursday night.

The reigning world champion was the star attraction on the opening day of the tournament at Alexandra Palace, and he averaged 96.96 and hit eight 180s on his way to victory against the world No 44.

But the Dutchman was made to sweat by his 25-year-old opponent before eventually putting him away in the fourth set to claim a 3-1 victory.

After his win, Van Gerwen said: ‘He (Cullen) played well and put me under pressure, but a win is a win and I’m into the next round.

‘I didn’t play very well and I wasn’t consistent enough but that’s something to work around. I hit eight 180s but I made too many mistakes.

‘When he put me under pressure, my form was there straight away and that was a good sign for me.

‘The pressure wasn’t too bad, but I think I did quite well for the first game because the most important thing in the first round of the World Championship is winning.’

Van Gerwen looked to be in his groove straight away, hitting his first 180 in the opening leg of the match to leave himself a shot at double 16 for a 10-dart leg and a break of throw.

But Cullen made an emphatic statement by checking out 161 with a bulls-eye finish to take the opening leg. The opening set went all the way to a deciding fifth leg, and Van Gerwen clinched it against the throw by hitting double top.

Cullen had never been beyond the first round in his three previous visits to Alexandra Palace, but he made things very awkward for the world No 1.

After three successive breaks of throw to start the second set, Cullen found himself 2-1 ahead and spurned a golden opportunity to level the scores by missing two darts for the set.

Van Gerwen knew he had dodged a bullet, and stole the set in the deciding leg on his own throw.

Cullen wasn’t to be disheartened, though, as he came straight back to take the third set and rattle the cage of the world champion.

The Dutchman was finally woken up in the fourth set as he his five 180s and raced into a 2-0 lead, one leg away from winning the match.

But back came Cullen again, this time with a 128 checkout to break back. He then had Van Gerwen even more concerned after hitting 104 in the next leg to send the set to a deciding leg.

But that was as far as Cullen’s stubborn resistance stretched as Van Gerwen checked out 84 to seal his place in the second round after Christmas.

Cullen but admitted that he was disappointed by the result.

‘I don’t think Michael played well at all to be honest,’ the world No 44 said. ‘We are the same age but he has got far more experience and knows what it take to win sets and matches on the big stage.’
