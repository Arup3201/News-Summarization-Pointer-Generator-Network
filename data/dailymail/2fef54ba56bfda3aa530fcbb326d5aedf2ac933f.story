Arsenal have shown an interest in Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic but a deal is highly unlikely.

The Serbian has hit an impasse with Chelsea in talks over a new contract but the Stamford Bridge club still rate him highly and while Arsenal had hoped to find a solution at around £8m, the 30-year-old is valued closer to £15m and would command wages of around £150,000 a week.

Arsenal are looking for centre-backs to replace Thomas Vermaelen who is expected to join Manchester United although their valuations are understood to be some distance apart.

Target: Arsenal are interested in Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic

Norwich are in discussions with Palermo over a deal for Kyle Lafferty.

The 26-year-old is due in England for a medical with the clubs talking over a £3million fee. Palermo were considering selling the Northern Ireland international so they could fund a deal for Jasmin Kurtic a midfielder at Sassuolo.

Norwich have stepped in despite reputed interest also from Cardiff City, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers.

Lafferty only joined Palermo last summer from FC Sion and scored 12 times in 35 appearances last season. He started his career at Burnley before joining Rangers in the summer of 2008 for £3.25m.

Norwich's main target has been Jordan Rhodes of Blackburn but they will struggle to match his valuation.

Hull remain keen on signing Robert Snodgrass which could raise up to £6m while Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Gary Hooper are attracting interest also.

Blackburn, meanwhile, have signed Chris Brown from Doncaster and want Lee Peltier who has today left Leeds United.

West Ham after Algeria star Slimani

West Ham have revived their interest in Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani.

The striker has impressed for Algeria at the World Cup and scored against South Korea on Sunday. He was a target for West Ham earlier in the year and they discussed a potential loan in January but now Sporting want to cash-in.

Sporting want £6.5m for the 26-year-old and they may still be too rich for West Ham's liking.

They are looking to bring in a left-back, a defender, another midfielder and a striker. Nice left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak, River Plate's Eder Balanta, Monarcas Morelia's Jefferson Montero and Marcos Asensio of Real Mallorca have all been discussed.

However, free agent Gareth Barry is looking increasingly likely to take up Everton's contract offer.

Leicester join Blades in race for Maguire

Leicester City have joined the battle for Sheffield United defender Harry Maguire.

The 21-year-old has been the subject of bids from Wolves and Hull but now Premier League newboys Leicester are also looking at a £2million deal.

Hull still want an experienced centre-back with Tottenham's Michael Dawson still top of their list after missing out on Joleon Lescott but see Maguire as one that can be developed and who can play a supporting role initially.

Lille hoping to keep Origi and offload Kalou

Lille want to keep Tottenham target Divock Origi for another season but are willing to offload Salomon Kalou.

Belgium international striker Origi has been watched by Arsenal and Liverpool also in recent months but Lille want the 19-year-old to continue his development with them.

Kalou, however, will be allowed to return to the Premier League if clubs offer around £4m for the 28-year-old. Last year he attracted interest from West Brom, West Ham and Arsenal in January.

Meanwhile, another Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi of Standard Liege, who has had offers from Swansea and interest from Everton and Arsenal, is poised to join Marseille.

Milan are looking at forward options as they await bids for Mario Balotelli. They are also keen to find bargains with money still extremely tight at the San Siro and free agent Eto'o is a possibility but not their main target.

They will look to offload other members of their squad to raise funds and that is why they are listening to offers for Balotelli and midfielder Nigel de Jong who will be offered to Manchester United.
