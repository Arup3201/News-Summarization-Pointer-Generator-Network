David Cameron has taken a fresh swipe at the French government – ridiculing its 'nonsense' rule stopping people working more than 35 hours a week.

The Prime Minister said the French 'obsession' with the policy was to blame for the country's unemployment crisis – with more than 10 per cent of the population out of work, while the UK's jobless rate has plummeted to just 6.2 per cent.

Mr Cameron's jibe, which will spark fury in Paris, comes after the International Monetary Fund predicted Britain would overtake France to become the second-biggest economy in Europe next year.

David Cameron, talking to pensioners and older working people at Age UK's headquarters in London today, said French regulation was strangling its economy

David Cameron gave a fresh hint he would like to increase the inheritance tax threshold so that it only hits the 'very wealthy'.

The Prime Minister said people who did not feel 'in any way mega-rich' were being hit by the tax.

He told a gathering of pensioners and older workers that people should be able to pass their family home to their children 'rather than leave it to the taxman'.

Inheritance tax is levied at a rate of 40 per cent on the value of an estate above the £325,000 threshold - with married couples able effectively to combine their allowances to £650,000.

The Tories had promised to raise the threshold to £1million, but the policy failed to make the coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats when the Government took office in 2010 - with the priority given to raising the personal income tax allowance instead.

But the Prime Minister said today he would like to see 'more progress' on the issue, adding that Chancellor George Osborne was 'keen' to address it.

He said: 'To me inheritance tax is a tax that should be paid by the very wealthy. I think you should be able to pass a family home on to your children rather than leave it to the taxman.'

He said he had ambitions to go beyond the current £650,000 threshold for couples. 

The UK economy is expected to grow by 3.2 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent in 2015, compared with just 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent in France.

Mr Cameron has made a habit of criticising France following Francois Hollande's election as President in 2012.

Just weeks after Mr Hollande's election victory the Prime Minister said he would 'roll out the red carpet' for French companies fleeing his proposed 75 per cent tax on millionaires.

And earlier this year Mr Cameron Mr Cameron made a thinly-veiled dig at Mr Hollande's economic record – criticising governments pursuing policies which would lead to 'more borrowing, more spending and more debt'.

He said countries following this approach were seeing 'increasing unemployment, industrial stagnation and enterprise in free fall'.

Mr Cameron's latest swipe comes after the chief John Lewis told a group of young entrepreneurs last Thursday that 'France is finished' and was 'sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat'.

In the Prime Minister's latest assault on France today, he said the 35 hour week had resulted in lower investment and an unemployment rate far in excess of the UK's.

Mr Cameron said France was in danger of falling for the 'nonsense' idea that there were a fixed number of jobs in the economy and that a 35-hour week would help share the work around.

He acknowledged it was 'very dangerous' to point a finger at a fellow European country, but launched an attack on the policy which has remained in place under socialist president Francois Hollande - despite calls for reform from within his own administration.

Mr Cameron launched his attack on the French employment model while responding to questions from pensioners and older workers at Age UK's London head office.

He was asked about prejudice against over-50s in the workplace and how some older workers felt pressured to retire to make way for a new generation.

But Mr Cameron said: 'People feeling guilty that they are somehow hogging a job that could otherwise be available to a young person? I just think we should have no truck with that argument at all.

'The idea - economists would call it the lump of labour fallacy - the idea that there is just a fixed number of jobs and all you have got to do is try and divide them up between young people, old people, males, females - I think it's nonsense.

'What we have demonstrated in the last four years, and of course it's been a difficult time economically for many, we have demonstrated that you can create millions more jobs. There are 1.8 million more people in work today than when I became Prime Minister.

'If we had sat there in 2010 and said 'it's going to be tough, we are not going to get any more jobs, let's just carve them up and tell some people to retire early' I think that would have been a terrible mistake.'

Unemployment in the UK has fallen steadily since 2011, while France has seen its jobless rate spike

The British economy recorded better growth than France last year - and is predicted to pull away from its continental rival this year and next

He then set his sights on the economy across the channel, telling the audience: 'Very dangerous to ever point a finger at another European country but I sometimes think the French, with their obsession with the 35-hour working week, they are falling into the danger of a lump of labour fallacy, where 'if only everyone just worked 35 hours there would be more work to go round'.

'I think what you have seen is that results in higher unemployment, less competitive industry, fewer people wanting to invest in your economy.

'That's why the rates of unemployment in France and in Britain are so different. Ours is way, way below theirs.'

Mr Cameron said there should not be a stigma about employing older people, saying some companies such as DIY chain B&Q were 'doing amazing work' .

He added: 'The truth is fewer and fewer of us are going to start a job aged 21 and work through that job for the rest of our lives. Training and on the job training and continuous training is going to be part of people's lives, and that should be the case for people in their 50s and 60s as well.'
