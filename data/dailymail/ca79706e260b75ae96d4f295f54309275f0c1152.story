Malaysia has its Prosperity Burger, the Indians tuck into McCurry Pan and in Israel there’s the ever-popular McKebab.

And now McDonald’s has a new, rather decadent addition to its South Korean restaurant menu – Honey Butter French Fries.

It’s the latest international addition to the Golden Arches’ ever-evolving foreign offerings.

A fishy affair: This burger from Japan contains a patty made from battered prawns and is topped with thousand island dressing

Don’t be fooled into thinking that McDonald's abroad is going to be exactly the same as it is back home; in fact different countries have their own additions to the menu, designed to appeal to local tastes.

China, Taiwan and Hong Kong take the the Ying-Yang vibe to food with one burger that comes in a black bun and another that comes in a white bun.

The black burger contains a beef patty topped with onion and black pepper sauce, while the white burger has a chicken burger topped with spicy sauce and lettuce.

While there's nothing wrong with the concept of a crab burger, the McDonald's crab croquette has us feeling a little but unsettled.

Available only Japan, the snowcrab and mushroom croquette was swaddled between a ciabatta bun and covered in ketchup.
