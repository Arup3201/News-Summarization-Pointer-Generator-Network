The U.S. rugby team’s fastest player is taking his talents to the gridiron.

Carlin Isles, 24, has signed a contract with the National Football League's Detroit Lions to play wide receiver, the team announced.

Mr Isles will play at first for the team’s practice squad, according to the announcement. The season ends Sunday, it is not clear how long the contract will last.

World-class speed: Carlin Isles runs a fast enough 100 meter dash to potentially qualify for the Olympics

The fastest player on the rugby pitch, he ran the benchmark 40-yard dash in less than 4.3 seconds, according to the team. That places him in the upper echelon of speed in the league.

Mr Carlin plays winger for Team USA. His fastest 100 meter time of 10.13 seconds would have qualified for at least the semifinals at the 2012 London Summer Olympics, according to CNN.

He was signed after another player was promoted from the practice squad to the main team for Sunday’s game, the last of the season.

Wide receiver is a position where players with varying background from track and field to basketball have found success in the past. Mr Carlin isn’t even the only rugby player in the league.

‘Indianapolis has a rugby guy as a pass rusher (Daniel Adongo) and I know San Fran brought a guy in (Lawrence Okoye) that was a shot-putter or a discus guy,’ said Lions coach Jim Schwartz.

The coach also mused about athletes from other sports making the jump to the gridiron.

‘It hasn't been unusual to see basketball players transition to the NFL,’ Mr Schwartz said. ‘That's not just recently, that goes way back. Even track guys like Bob Hayes and Renaldo Nehemiah, things like that.

‘An athlete's an athlete. There are skills that you can develop, and if you see something you like then you can work with him.’

Mr Adongo has played two games for the Colts this year while Mr Okoye was placed on season-ending injured reserve.

With the allure of playing in the NFL being dangled in front of him, Mr Isles still plans to play Rugby.

‘Thank you everyone!!!!! No worries I'll still be playing rugby and will be in Vegas. God has been good and just enjoying gods blessings,’ he tweeted Thursday evening after the announcement was made public.

He explained the move to CNN.

‘Rugby is quite similar to American football,’ Mr Isles said. ‘Besides the blocking and no pads, the tackling is similar. But American football you've got breaks -- rugby, you don't have no breaks, you've got to keep running and running.’

He played football in both high school and college before joining US rugby, he added.

His new coach is excited at his potential, and even compared him to one of the league’s best return men.

‘He's a legit track guy,’ Schwartz said in the statement. ‘I mean, his background happened to be rugby, but it's probably more track and that speed, that's not unusual at all to see track athletes get chances.

‘The guy for Denver [return man Trindon Holliday] that went to LSU had a similar background and maybe even similar size,’ he continued.

The team may be looking outside the box for answers after missing the playoffs and going into the season’s final game with seven wins and eight losses.
