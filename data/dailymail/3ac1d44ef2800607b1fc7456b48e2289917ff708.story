Rioters seized control of Rio's main railway station as protests against a rise in travel costs erupted in violence across Brazil's capital.

Police fired tear gas and stun grenades on demonstrators who had taken to the streets after the city's mayor announced a 10-cent hike in bus fare.

During the violence a cameraman for Band TV was hit in the 
head by either a stun grenade launched by police or a homemade explosive
 tossed by protesters; it was not immediately clear which.

Band said in a statement that cameraman 
Santiago Andrade was taken to a hospital by police and underwent 
surgery. He's in serious condition.

For
 several hours last night members of the passe livre, or free pass, 
movement occupied Central do Brasil, smashed ticket barriers and let 
commuters travel without paying.

This is the latest protest to hit Brazil since last June, when nationwide demonstrations broke out after a sharp police crackdown on a group in Sao Paulo that was marching against an increase in public transportation fares.

That increase was reversed in the face of protesters' pressure.

Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes recently approved a 10-cent increase for bus fares starting this Saturday.

About
 800 protesters had peacefully gathered on Thursday in central Rio before 
they started marching to the city's main train station, some holding 
aloft signs condemning the billions of dollars spent to host the World 
Cup, money they want used for better hospitals, schools and 
infrastructure.

Clashes broke out inside the train station after demonstrations began jumping over turnstiles and police used batons and tear gas to disperse members of the Black Block anarchist tactic.

Police pushed the demonstrators outside and used more tear gas to disperse those gathered, while demonstrators hurled rocks at the officers.

Authorities were forced to close the station, leaving thousands of commuters stranded. Some bystanders were made ill by the tear gas, while others fainted.

Standoff: Demonstrators set up makeshift barricades in the street to hold back the police

Thais Jorao, a 22-year-old protester, said that demonstration wasn't simply because of the 10-cent bus fare hike.

'If it was a public transportation fare hike when we had good health services and education, you wouldn't have this many people on the street,' he said.

'On top of this you see spending with the World Cup, things that we really don't need. We want health, education, decent public transportation.'
