A Florida woman said she was humiliated by local police as she accused them of hogtying her, parading her around topless and bashing some of her teeth out during her arrest last year. 

Ashleigh Davis, of Ocala, Florida, said she found herself on the wrong side of the law in April of last year at the Leesburg Bikefest after she and another woman were having an argument.

When police asked her to leave, she reportedly refused, and was bound by her hands and feet by officers from the Leesburg Police Department and Lake County Sheriff’s Office.

Damage: Davis said her teeth were cracked after one of the officers slammed her head into the floor

Speaking out: Davis says she deserved to be arrested, but not the brutality she claims to have suffered

The 32-year-old said that while she was being detained, her bikini top fell off, and officers whisked her away topless in front of onlookers.

Davis told the Palm Beach Post: '[Officers] handcuffed my hands to my feet and then took a tie and tied it around, then carried me like a suitcase and threw me on the back of a golf cart.'

She told the paper that she suffered further shame at the Leesburg Police Department, as she laid nearly naked on the floor of the police station holding cell while a group of officers laughed at her.

Davis said that the abuse didn’t stop there, as one of them allegedly smacked her face against the floor and chipped some of her teeth after she had bitten him.

She told the Post: 'I just remember him grabbing me from behind, my hair and [covered my mouth] and then I try to bite, and then they grabbed me by the back of my head and slammed my face down.'

She admits that she probably deserved to be arrested, but that the officers she dealt with were way over the line.

Davis was charged with two counts of aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence and disorderly intoxication, and is serving probation in the case.

She claimed that she had filed a complaint against the officer, days after her arrest.

Her attorney, Stan Plappert, told WESH.com: 'I think they should have sensitivity training. You would think that they would know that, "hey, I have a topless woman or a nearly naked person. I need to do something to cover them up, to give them some dignity."'

Davis added: 'I don't want this to happen again. I want people to be treated the way we’re supposed to be treated, and yes, I'm paying for what I did, and I want them to pay for what has happened to me.'
