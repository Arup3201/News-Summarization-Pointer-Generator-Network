A pensioner who died after his Halifax bank account was drained of £50,000 by his own grandson has had to fight a legal battle from ‘beyond the grave’ to get it back.

John Bowden, 73, from Failsworth, Greater Manchester, was in hospital when he discovered Michael Howes, 25, had set up an online banking facility to secretly steal his savings over a two-year period.

On his deathbed, the retired engineer urged his family to get the money back from the bank before he passed away from organ failure.

But when relatives urged the Halifax - which has the slogan ‘giving you extra’ - to refund the money into Mr Bowden’s estate due it to be withdrawn illegally, staff intially refused, saying no money was due because the account holder was now 'deceased'.

The family had to fight for up to four months before the bank agreed to pay up.

Jobless Howes, 25, who was taking up to £2,000 a time from his grandfather’s account to fund a lavish lifestyle, is now serving 21 months after pleading guilty to theft.

But he is now set to inherit a share of his grandfather’s will because Mr Bowden was too ill to change it before his death.

Today, as the Halifax apologised, Mr Bowden’s son, John Jnr, 40, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: ‘I can’t believe nobody at the bank picked up on the fact that a 73-year-old man had suddenly set up online banking and was spending so much money in such a short space of time.

‘No one told him something appeared to be wrong with his account until it was too late. The bank should have realised something was amiss and investigated sooner. When I first realised how much money Michael had stolen I was absolutely blown away.

‘When I went into my local Halifax with my dad’s death certificate I thought everything would be okay and that the money would be put back into my dad’s account.

‘But the bank told me that because my dad wasn’t here to make a statement they wouldn’t be able to give the money back.

‘I was shocked. It was bad enough being betrayed by a member for the family, but it seemed we were being betrayed all over again by certain people in the bank. I would have thought the bank would have investigated sooner.

‘Everyone was telling me to give up. They all said the same: "You can’t beat the banks, you can’t beat the banks." But I had promised my dad I would get the money back for him and there was no way that I was going to give up.’

John Bowden Jnr said: 'I can't believe nobody at the bank picked up on the fact that a 73-year-old man had suddenly set up online banking and was spending so much money in such a short space of time'

The thefts emerged in July last year while Mr Bowden Snr was in an induced coma after suffering two heart attacks. His son opened two letters addressed to his father confirming overdraft amounts on his bank account.

It was later discovered that Howes, who was living with Mr Bowden Snr at his home, had stolen £50,533 from the account by setting up online banking and making transfers into his own personal account.

He spent the money on nights out, tattoos, gambling, designer clothes and a holiday to Turkey.

Mr Bowden Snr was readmitted to hospital after complications over his heart surgery and died from organ failure the following October - a month before his grandson pleaded guilty to theft. He was jailed in December.

Mr Bowden Jnr, a roofer who is Howes’s uncle, said: ‘Once I had looked through the bank statements I contacted Halifax straightaway and they told me that if Michael was prosecuted and convicted we would get the money back.

‘My dad passed away on October 15, but I had to wait until Michael was jailed on the December 15 before I could do anything. But even then I visited the Oldham branch countless times and they didn’t seem to be able to help me and told me they wouldn’t pay out as my father and died.

‘I couldn’t believe it. I had done everything they had asked and now they were telling me it wasn’t going to be. I called the bank ombudsman and they told me I had to lodge an official complaint and give Halifax eight weeks to investigate.

‘For a whole week I called Halifax and wrote complaints to them on Facebook and Twitter. I was absolutely determined. The money was meant to be an inheritance for the family and we wanted to make sure that it went to the right people.

‘I wasn’t bothered about the money because it’s not for me anyway. I was just set on getting the money back because I had promised my dad that I would...‘

‘Eventually I received a phone call asking me to go in and they showed me the money had been put back in. I broke down into tears in the middle of the bank.

‘It had gone all the way up to the chief executive and the money was back in my dad’s account. It was such a relief but I would give it all back now to have my dad back. I don’t feel like I will ever be happy again because I have lost my dad.’

‘I am now trying to get Michael cut out of my dad’s will. One of the last things my dad said to me was to make sure Michael got nothing. It broke his heart. Michael was the apple of my dad’s eye. My dad would have given him anything he wanted.

‘At the very end my dad was too ill to change his will and we didn’t have the money to pay for the solicitor’s fees to get it changed, but I am now doing everything in my power to make sure that Michael gets nothing.’

The Halifax said: ‘We are extremely sorry that Mr Bowden did not receive the level of service that we aim to provide. We could and should have provided him with more support while resolving this issue.

‘In situations such as Mr Bowden’s, where an account holder has passed away, we are still able to investigate potentially fraudulent activity at the request of a recognised authority of the account, such as an executor.

‘Since Mr Bowden has been able to provide the necessary documentation of his role as the executor of his father’s estate we have been able to take the necessary steps to undertake a thorough investigation.

‘The outcome of this is that we have been able to refund the transactions that were identified as being fraudulent, which amounted to £51,583 including the associated interest and charges.’
