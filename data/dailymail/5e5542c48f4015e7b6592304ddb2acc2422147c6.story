A lucky sheepdog was saved from burning to death after a refuse worker spotted him among rubbish about to be thrown into a scorching hot 1,000C incinerator.

Wensley, a Shetland sheepdog, became trapped in a bunker full of rubbish at a waste plant on Monday afternoon after going missing three days earlier.

The dog was just seconds away from being thrown into the blistering heat with the rubbish when a crane worker spotted movement among the bin-liners and raised the alarm.

Missing: Wensley had disappeared from a park in West Bridgford, Nottingham, three days before he was discovered at the Eastcroft waste plant

Firefighters were called and lowered down the 40ft drop to rescue the one-year-old and reunite him with his grateful owners Dorothy and Roger Bladon.

Wensley had been missing for three days after he ran off from Mrs Bladon when she was walking him in a park in West Bridgford, Nottingham.

Mrs Bladon, 71, said yesterday: 'The more days that passed the more we thought we would never find him.

'I was absolutely delighted when I heard he had been found and I cannot quite believe what he has been through, he is so lucky.'

Two fire crews and a specialist rescue team were called in for the rescue operation at the plant in Eastcroft, Nottingham.

Firefighters reached a terrified Wensley at the bottom of the bunker, caught him in a net and hoisted him to safety.

Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service Station Manager Andy Lindley said: 'He was obviously very scared.

'We are all really pleased that he appears to be unharmed by the experience and that the RSPCA has managed to reunite him with his owner. He had a very lucky escape.'

Mrs Bladon, who is from Liverpool, was visiting her son James Cousins when she decided to take Wensley for a walk in the park last Friday.

She added: 'I just let him off the lead for an extra run and a spaniel that was in the field ran at him. He got nervous and darted off.

'The next morning I went around asking people if they had seen him but I couldn’t find him. I decided I’d probably never see him again.

'When the RSPCA called to say he’d been found and told me what had happened I was just saying "thank you, thank you".'

Firefighters handed Wensley over to RSPCA animal collection officer Marcus Coulby, who found the dog had a microchip which provided him with Mrs Bladon's contact details.

Mr Coulby said: 'I couldn’t quite believe it when I heard what had happened to him.'
