Even footballers need good English and maths, David Cameron has told his son Arthur to emphasise the importance of working hard at school.

The Prime Minister revealed how the eight-year-old had challenged his claim that every job requires good literacy and numeracy.

Mr Cameron insisted that even star players need to have basic English and maths so they can ‘read the contract and count the money’.

David Cameron, appearing at an event with Chancellor George Osborne, said even footballers need to have good qualifications in maths and English

England striker Wayne Rooney hired a private tutor in 2007 to help him study for GCSEs in maths and English at the age of 22, having failed to sit them as a teenager.

Mr Cameron expressed his exasperation that tens of thousands of people applying for jobs do not have the basic skills employers need.

He insisted that English and maths are ‘vocational subjects’ and not just an academic pursuit.

He revealed how car giant Mercedes had received 30,000 applications for just 5,000 apprenticeships, but too few people had maths and English to a decent standard.

Half of young people start adult life without getting GCSE A*-C in 2 English and maths.

The government warns that adults who lack literacy and numeracy skills tend to be less productive at work, earn lower wages, are more likely to suffer from ill health and experience social exclusion.

Speaking at an event in Hertfordshire yesterday, Mr Cameron told construction workers: ‘We have got to remind young people that English and maths are vocational subjects.

‘I tell my children there is not a job in the world that does not require English and maths.

‘My son says what about football players? I say well you have got to be able to read the contract and count the money. Everything requires English and maths.’

The Prime Minister stressed the need to create a skilled UK workforce in order to make sure jobs in the country go to British people.

During an event at leading construction company Skanska's offices in Hertfordshire, Mr Cameron was asked how the Government could make sure British jobs went to British workers.

He said: ‘I did one of these things at Mercedes the other day and they said they were trying to take on 5,000 apprentices. I said: “How many people did you have apply?”

‘They said 30,000. I said “my God how did you decide how to get the apprentices?” and they said the trouble is, of the 30,000 that apply, not enough have the basic English and maths.’

The UK Independence Party yesterday launched a poster campaign warning that EU migrants want to take the jobs of Brits.

Ukip has paid for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such as: ‘26million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?’

Another has a picture of a construction worker begging on the street, with the slogan: ‘EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.’

But Mr Cameron insisted that improvements were being made to ensure that Britons can compete in the jobs market.

The PM said: ‘I think if you look back five or 10 years ago we had a real problem there in that when we did generate jobs, a lot of those jobs were going to people from overseas coming here quite understandably to do those jobs because we were not creating a skilled workforce here at home. I think we have made some big, big improvements.

‘During this Parliament so far we have made 1.6 million apprentices. I want to get to two million apprenticeships by the end of this Parliament.’
