Hasina Ganchi was given the all-clear after a CT scan last July, but in August she suffered a brain haemorrhage

A mother-of-four suffered a brain haemorrhage after doctors gave her the all-clear when part of her brain scan results went missing.

Royal Blackburn Hospital has apologised to Hasina Ganchi, admitting it is 'likely' a correct diagnosis would have prevented the 42-year-old's haemorrhage.

The hospital wrote to Mrs Ganchi blaming a 'computer failure' for mistake, telling her a section of her CT scan had been unavailable to doctors considering her case.

Otherwise, it said, radiologists would have been able to see she had a brain aneurysm.

Mrs Ganchi, from Blackburn, had suffered headaches for more than a decade, prompting doctors to send her for a scan at the hospital in July last year.

She was told the results were 'okay', but in August Mrs Ganchi collapsed while working at the family-owned takeaway.

Mrs Ganchi, who is married to Noor, said: 'I have had headaches for 10 to 12 years but I was never referred to the hospital for an X-ray or anything.

'The medication kept going up and up and they said it was all sorts of things, such as depression.'

Following her scan on July 5, she said she was given the all-clear.

'Then in August, I was at the shop and I had a dizzy spell,' she said.

'The people around said I was falling and they grabbed me.'

Mrs Ganchi was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where scans showed she had had an aneurysm - a swelling of blood within an artery or vein.

An official complaint was lodged against Royal Blackburn and Mrs Ganchi and her family met with hospital bosses earlier this month.

She said: 'We wanted to keep a record of everything said in the meeting so we asked for them to record it and send us a copy.

'But when they sent the CD, it was blank. It just added insult to injury.'

The Royal Blackburn Hospital has apologised to Mrs Ganchi, admitting it is 'likely' a correct diagnosis would have been made if a 'computer error' had not resulted in part of her brain scan going missing and being unavailable to doctors assessing her case

Mrs Ganchi said she was still suffering severe headaches, but the cause has never been diagnosed.

She said: 'I can’t do things that I used to do and I am not myself. I sometimes wish I had just died when I had the haemorrhage.'

In a letter sent after that meeting, radiology manager David O’Brien said after Mrs Ganchi’s first scan, it was decided a second scan with an injection of dye was needed and undertaken.

'While it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether or not identifying the aneurysm earlier would have prevented you (Mrs Ganchi) suffering the haemorrhage, this is a likely possibility'

- Radiology manager David O'Brien of the Royal Blackburn Hospital

However because of the computer problems, the findings of the second scan were not placed on her report.

He said: 'When you had a further scan in August the radiologist referred back to your previous examination and noted that images demonstrated a 4mm aneurysm in the middle cerebral artery.

'While it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether or not identifying the aneurysm earlier would have prevented you suffering the haemorrhage, this is a likely possibility.

'Please accept my sincere apologies on behalf of the directorate and indeed the trust for this system failure and for any additional suffering and anguish it may have caused.'

He added that new procedures had been put in place to prevent similar incidents happening again.

Chris Pearson, chief nurse at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'Patient confidentiality is of the utmost importance to us so we are unable to comment on individual cases.'
