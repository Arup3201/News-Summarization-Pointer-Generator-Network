This is the incredible moment a daredevil wingsuit flyer performed a high-five mid air while free-falling from the side of a mountain.  

Thrill-seeker Nathan Jones pulled of the death-defying stunt as he plummeted from a mountain top in the Alps with friend Sam Hardy.

The amazing footage, which was shot by Mr Hardy, shows the extreme sports fans flying down the side of the mountain, just dodging large rocks and boulders.

This is the amazing moment when a pair of daredevils completed the world's first wingsuit high five

At the bottom of the mountain, Mr Jones can be seen hitting a large cardboard hand at the bottom of the mountain. 

The stunt is believed to be the world's first ever wingsuit high five. 

The video, which lasts 3 minutes and 16 seconds was shot by an organisation called Project:BASE in Chamonix, France. The video was shot to raise funds to build a water well in Ethiopia.

It has already been viewed more than 76,000 times on YouTube and shared thousands of times on Facebook.  

Web user orangy574 wrote: 'The scary part is how close he is to the ground

without going down and smashing into the rocks and dirt.'

Tomas Andersonian put on Facebook: 'Awesome guys, holding my breath the

whole flight. So close to the ground its scary.'

While Youtube user Conjurthis simply stated: 'This is unreal.'

The 3 minute 16 second video shows the two daredevils 'flying' down the mountain side at high speed

Both men flew just a few feet above the ground as they hurtled down the side of the mountain before landing

The daredevils were mobbed upon their safe return to the foot of the mountain near Chamonix, France
