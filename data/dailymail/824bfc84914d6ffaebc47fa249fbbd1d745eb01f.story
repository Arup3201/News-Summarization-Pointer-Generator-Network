Dashing at frenetic speeds through woodland and instinctively reacting to its remarkable sense of smell a beagle dog demonstrates his innate sniffing ability in this fascinating new GoPro video. 

During the two minute footage, Ember, a lemon beagle, reacts decisively to follow a hunt trail and track down a synthetic scent left by a hunt-master.

A wearable GoPro was attached to Ember's back in order to capture  the unique  point-of-view footage in the South African countryside.

At the beginning of the video the dog is unleashed in a grassland area and he immediately dashes off vigorously towards a country road where he follows the trail of the scent towards a wooded area.

The beagle is then seen running for one and a half minutes and he stops momentarily on just a few occasions for an additional sniff before quickly running on again.

After one minute and 33 seconds the dog runs into a group of people and he is warmly congratulated on successfully following the scent trail and completing the challenge. 

Challenge: Ember the beagle prepares to embark on his scent hunt with a number of other competing dogs
