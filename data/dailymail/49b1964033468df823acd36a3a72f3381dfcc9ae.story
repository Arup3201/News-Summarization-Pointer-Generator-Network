A British man has been arrested on a suspected murder charge over the stabbing death of a love rival in the Austrian town that was the home of Josef Fritzl, the engineer who kept his daughter locked in a cellar for 24 years.

Roman Topf, 39, was discovered with two stab wounds, in a courtyard of a house in Böhlerwerk, a suburb of Amstetten, where Fritzl lived. He is thought to have bled to death after his carotid artery was severed.

Austrian police said that they had arrested 36-year-old Raphael Andrew Diemoz from Bradford, West Yorkshire. They also revealed that they had recovered two blood stained knives from the scene.

Alleged murderer: Raphael Diemoz from West Yorkshire is in custody in Austria following the stabbing death of his love rival Roman Topf

Scene of death: This is the bloodied bench where Roman Topf was found dead in the early hours if Wednesday having bled to death after being stabbed in the neck

Diemoz alleged that Mr Topf had threatened him with the knives but he had managed to disarm him before stabbing him twice in the neck.

According to police, the stabbing occurred after a heavy drinking session. The two men who had been celebrating the birthday of a third man were seeking the favours of a 30-year-old waitress. She invited Diemoz, Mr Topf and the other man back to her flat at 2am to continue drinking.

She quickly tired of their attentions and told all three to leave. It was not long after that Mr Topf was killed.

His bloodied remains were discovered by another tenant around 4am on a bench in the courtyard below the waitress’s home.

Diemoz remains in custody in St Poelten prison.
