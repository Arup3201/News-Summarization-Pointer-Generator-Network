Every four years the warning sounds: Do not buy players on the back of a good World Cup.

Every four years, however, such caution is duly ignored.

And why not? After all, these are players who have seized the chance to showcase their merits on the biggest stage of all.

This weekend - at the business end of the competition - will be no different.

Skill school: Colombia's midfielder James Rodriguez has been one of the stars of the World Cup

It is the proverbial 'shop window' and there are no shortage of cash-laden customers peering through its glass.

We have already seen players such as Colombia's James Rodriguez catapult their star into another galaxy.

But there are countless others jostling for position in the shop front.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through those for whom this weekend's quarter-finals mean more than simply winning a place in the last four.

Belgium (v Argentina, 5pm, Saturday)

Divock Origi (Lille) - £10m

No teenager has made a bigger impression on these finals and, having come from the bench in each of the group games - scoring the winner against Russia - the 19-year-old deservedly won a start for the last-16 tie with USA. Again he used his pace, power and raw enthusiasm to unsettle his minders and was unlucky not to add to his tournament tally. He has outshone Romelu Lukaku and, given his team-mate's reputation on these shores, it is little surprise to see Premier League clubs declaring an interest. Liverpool are chief among them, although a loan deal back to Lille is thought to be one of the conditions of a move.

Colombia (v Brazil, 9pm, Friday)

David Ospina (Nice) - FREE

The agile Ospina has conceded just twice in Brazil and will again have to be at his best to deny the hosts on Friday. After six years in Ligue 1 with Nice - he signed for them when he was 19 - he will move on this summer and Arsenal are said to be interested. After this tournament, though, Ospina deserves to be more than just a back-up to Wojciech Szczesny.

Jackson Martinez (Porto) - £35m

The 27-year-old has already said he would jump at the chance of a move to Arsenal and, with Arsene Wenger reportedly willing to pay his £35m buyout clause, the striker could well end up in the Premier League. He scored twice in the 4-0 demolition of Japan in the group stage and his athleticism and eye for goal - he has 60 goals in 91 games for Porto - make him one of Europe's most sought-after stars.

Juan Cuadrado (Fiorentina) - £30m

Fiorentina aren't daft; after the winger's impressive entrance to Brazil 2014 they moved swiftly to acquire full ownership from Udinese. Since then his worth has amplified every time he has taken to the field. The 26-year-old couples flair with fight and a willingness to put a shift in for his side. Indeed, no wideman ran further in Serie A last season. But Cuadrado is more than just a marathon man, as his four assists and one goal at the finals testify. Manchester United and Barcelona have taken note.

Costa Rica (v Holland, 9pm, Saturday)

Keylor Navas (Levante) - £8m

The goalkeeper has undoubtedly been one of the surprise stars of the tournament, just as he was in La Liga last season. The 27-year-old has conceded just twice and was decisive in the penalty-shootout victory over Greece. Levante are demanding that Atletico Madrid pay the £8m buyout clause in his contract but others are said to be circling.

Celso Borges (AIK Solna) - £2m

The midfielder has been key to Costa Rica's journey to the last eight, a player who marries his craft to graft and is said to be the 'lungs' of this enterprising side. His residence in the Swedish league remains something of a surprise but that is likely to change after the finals, especially given that he is still just 26 years old.

France (v Germany, 5pm, Friday)

Antoine Griezmann (Real Sociedad) - £25m

We've been aware of the talented left-winger for a while given his reputation when rising through the youth ranks - he also broke into the Sociedad side at 18 - but only now is his star coming to the fore on the international stage. He has thrilled at these finals with his pace and trickery, and that comes on the back of a 16-goal campaign in La Liga. At 23 years old Sociedad are aware of his market value and it will take an offer north of £20m before they even entertain discussions.

Germany (v France, 5pm, Friday)

Toni Kroos (Bayern Munich) - £25m

The 24-year-old playmaker is reluctant to commit his future to Bayern - his contract expires next summer - and Manchester United are ready to pounce. Another commanding display against France, however, may well alert some of the other European big boys and a battle for his signature could ensue. Real Madrid are already among his admirers.

Holland (v Costa Rica, 9pm, Saturday)

Daley Blind (Ajax) - £10m

The son of Ajax legend, Danny, immediately caught the eye with two assists in the 5-1 win against Spain. Since then he has looked solid in defence and bright in attack, sparking talk of Louis van Gaal taking him to Manchester United. At 24, time is on his side and a more illustrious setting then the Eredivise surely awaits, although the Dutch champions will demand a fee of at least £10m.

Bruno Martins Indi (Feyenoord) - £7m

The 21-year-old defender has enjoyed a rapid rise through the ranks at both club and international level. He is equally adept at centre-back or covering at left-back and, given his tender years, a big-money move could well be in the offing. Like team-mate Blind he has been linked with United but FC Porto are also weighing up a £7m bid.
