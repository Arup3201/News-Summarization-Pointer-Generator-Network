A man who shot dead his friend's pregnant wife while playing with a revolver 'gunslinger-style' will not face any criminal charges, Florida prosecutors have announced. 

William DeHayes was showing off his gun collection to his friend Carson Hoover and his friend's wife Katherine Lynn Hoover, 25, when the tragedy occurred. 

DeHayes invited the Carsons over to his $50,000 home in Brooksville, Hernando County in Florida on July 26, 2014 when he began playing with his .22 calibre revolver.

Witnesses said DeHayes spun the weapon around on his forefinger, 'gunslinger-style' when it went off, hitting Mrs Hoover in the head. 

Mrs Hoover, who was five months pregnant, was rushed to hospital where she underwent an emergency caesarean section. Unfortunately, the baby Rehlin Lee Hoover, died 30 minutes after he was born.

Prosecutors in Hernando County, which is about 40 miles north of Tampa, decided that the shooting was accidental. 

However, the decision has been strongly criticised by Mrs Hoover's mother Donna Bryan, who has written to the Governor Rick Scott, State Attorney General Pam Bondi as well as the state attorney in Hernando County, Brad King. 

Speaking to the Tampa Tribune, Mrs Bryan said: 'I don’t understand. People go to jail for DUI. This man killed my daughter and grandson. I feel that my daughter deserves justice. She did nothing to deserve being killed and neither did my grandson.'

Mrs Bryan said she had spoken to her daughter on the day she was shot.

'She called, and she’s like, "We just bought the baby’s outfit he’s coming home in, but you’re not going to be happy." She goes, "It’s camouflage!" I don’t like camouflage, but she really did, and she was all excited. They had baby books in camouflage. The baby’s room was going to be in camouflage.'

Mrs Bryan said her grandson Nicholas, 7, has been living with the herself and her husband since the shooting. 

She said: 'My grandson (Nicholas) is alive, and I have him in therapy. He’s obviously upset and doesn’t understand why his mommy isn’t here. He asks where his brother is, and I tell him they went to heaven. He says, "Mommy didn’t even say goodbye to me." '

State attorney Mr King wrote back to Mrs Bryan and claimed that he could not prosecute DeHayes because, even though he was grossly negligent, his behaviour did not constitute a crime.

At the time of the shooting, DeHayes was not under the influence of any illegal drugs or alcohol, although he was on prescription medication at the time. 

Mrs Bryan has begun a petition to convince prosecutors to reverse their decision not to charge DeHayes after the incident.
