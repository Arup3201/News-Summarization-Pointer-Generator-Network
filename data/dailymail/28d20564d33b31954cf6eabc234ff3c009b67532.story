These tired seals were spotted snuggling up for a nap in their thousands.

The animals had come ashore in California in their hundreds during what is called a 'catastrophic molt', where they shed an entire layer of skin and hair.

Robert Jensen stumbled across the bizarre spectacle at the Piedres Blancas rookery.

These seals appeared more like sardines when they packed themselves onto a crowded beach for a snooze

The bizarre spectacle took place at the Piedres Blancas rookery, California

Initially mistaking the animals for 
driftwood until, the photographer, on closer inspection, realised he'd 
stumbled across the huge group of seals.

He said: ‘I had been on a family vacation and was looking for driftwood on the beaches with my daughter.

‘As we were returning to our hotel we spotted from a distance what looked like large pieces of driftwood.

‘But when we got a better look we realised the 'driftwood' was moving and it was actually a large group of elephant seals.’

Piedres Blancas is separated in to two beaches and can home as many as 15,000 elephant seals.

During Mr Jensen's visit, there were as many as 3,000 lying on the two beaches.

Mr Jensen, from California, said: ‘At this time of year the seals are growing new skin and shedding their old skin.

‘The juveniles and females come first, followed by the young males and then the adult males.

‘The elephant seal molt is considered a ‘catastrophic molt’ because, unlike most mammals, it occurs in a short period of time.’

He
added: ‘I had not seen anything like this before, but now that I know 
about this place, I will visit it each time I travel up there.

‘It is truly an amazing sight to see so many animals clustered together but it can be quite noisy when they are not resting.'
