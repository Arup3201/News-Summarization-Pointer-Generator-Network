A couple who used the proceeds of a £2.3million fraud to fund a luxury house, expensive holidays and even sci-fi memorabilia have been ordered to pay back just £330,000.

Julie Nickerson, 55, and her husband Anthony, 48, are currently serving prison sentences for siphoning the huge sum from her laundry equipment firm employers.

The pair were reunited in the dock at Bradford Crown Court for a confiscation hearing.

The couple spent £17,000 on film memorabilia from Christie's auction house including this bronze and gold, remote controlled Dalek

The Nickersons used some of the money to pay for a £500,000 house in Wainstall, Halifax (pictured) set in five acres of land with a hot spring and pool

Judge Robert Bartfield ordered Julie Nickerson, who is now bankrupt, to pay back a total of £209,753.58, and Anthony Nickerson to hand over £120,794.71.

The couple, formerly from Shelf, West Yorkshire, stole £2.3million so they could lavish the money on a £500,000 house set in five acres of land with a hot spring and pool, new cars and £200,000 worth of holidays.

They also spent £17,000 on film memorabilia from Christie's auction house and £10,000 on motorsport events at Silverstone.

After being employed by the Halifax-based firm since 1990, Julie Nickerson stole most of the money while working in the accounts and finance department, while her husband laundered the rest at the newsagents' he owned in nearby Shelf.

She was jailed for five years in May after admitting money laundering and fraud in relation to a false representation made to HM Customs and Excise, while Anthony Nickerson received a two-and-a-half year sentence for money laundering.

An auction of memorabilia from films and television shows such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who and Thunderbirds was reported to have raised about £25,000. Pictured is a Star Wars Darth Vader helmet included in the sale

In a hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act on Wednesday, it was heard that the available assets include money raised from the auction sale, the sale of Nickerson's newsagents business, the couple's pension funds and money seized by police at the time of the investigation.

In June, an auction of memorabilia from films and television shows such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who and Thunderbirds was reported to have raised about £25,000 and cash from the sell-off was included in confiscation orders made against the pair.

Rebecca Young, prosecuting, asked for the confiscated cash, which has to be handed over in the next three months, to be paid back to JLA Ltd as compensation.

Miss Young also told the judge that Julie Nickerson's benefit figure from criminal conduct had been assessed at just over £1.4million while her husband's benefit amount was put at £925,000.

A huge haul of sci-fi memorabilia was seized from Julie Nickerson and was later auctioned off

Judge Bartfield agreed to make the compensation order and he told Julie Nickerson that she would have to serve a further two years behind bars if the money was not paid back.

The judge said Anthony Nickerson would face an extra 15 months in prison if he did not comply with the order in his case.

The couple were led from the dock at the end of the hearing to continue serving their prison sentences.

Speaking previously, Det Con Ash Nuttall, of West Yorkshire Police's Calderdale Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) team, said: 'The Nickersons thought they were living the high life but they were living on money that had been stolen from others.

'They were constantly having to look over their shoulders waiting for the day justice caught up with them.

'That day has now come and they will have a long time in prison to consider the consequences of their actions.'
