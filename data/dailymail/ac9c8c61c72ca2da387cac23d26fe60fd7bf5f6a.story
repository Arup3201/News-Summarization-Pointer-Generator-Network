An arson attack on a Texas state senator's legislative offices has baffled police officers.

Officials say two Molotov cocktails were thrown into Texas State Senator Wendy Davis’ Forth Worth office Tuesday afternoon.

But they have no idea who it was who entered the West 7th office and threw the firebombs.

Firebomb: The offices of Senator Wendy Davis were attacked by two Molotov cocktails

Senator Davis was not in her office at the time, but two of her staff members were. No one was injured.

Davis, a Democrat who joined the Senate in 2009, spoke out about the attack in a Tuesday night press conference.

‘It's unfortunate when things like this happen in the public arena,’ she said.

‘It reminds us of how important it is for us to remain very civil in our discourse and to work not to foment this kind of anger in our community as we discuss things that are challenges that we all face and care about.’

Action: Molotov cocktails, like those fired at the Senator's office, can be incredibly dangerous

Her office says they don't know if the attacks were politically motivated.

‘Politics is always very heated and so we don't know that this has anything to do with politics.

'We'll know more when police and fire identify a suspect,’ said Anthony Spangler, Davis' communications director.

Officials say witnesses saw someone ignite a fire then flee the scene, but they did not release any other details on the investigation.
