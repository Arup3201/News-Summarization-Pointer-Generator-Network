NBA superstar LeBron James is no stranger to blocking shots, but he’s the one who got rejected when a top U.S. swimmer shut him down.

First time Olympian Lauren Perdue, 21, said she was approached by the basketball star on July 26 when the team came to the Olympic Village to meet the U.S. swimmers, who are tearing it up in London.

Perdue and James must have hit it off, because she said that the Miami Heat forward then asked her to have dinner with him.

She took to Twitter to express her excitement, saying: 'Lebron James just invited me to dinner... Um wuuuutttt?!?'

She also posted a photo of herself with James on Instagram.

However, it was later revealed that the swimming stunner turned down King James, saying she had to abide by the Olympic Village curfew.

Perhaps it was for the best, as the curfew-abiding swim champ won a gold medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay final just days later.

She later deleted the tweet, but not before it was re-tweeted by the University of Virginia, where Perdue is a senior.

In an interview with Charlotte Observer columnist Scott Fower, Perdue spilled the details of the encounter.

She said: 'He was kind of joking but he was basically like, 'Would you like to come eat with me at the dining hall?'

'And I said, 'Um, I'm sorry, I have a curfew. So I turned that one down, yeah.'

The invitation was likely just a friendly one, as the Miami Heat star is engaged to longtime girlfriend Savannah Brinson.

While the American swimmers are the talk of the town with their Olympic heroics, the men’s basketball team is also having a successful summer games – and making it look easy.

Last night, James and co. set an incredible Olympic record after they topped Nigeria 156-73, the largest margin ever recorded in Olympic basketball.

In fact, the team could have stopped 
playing after the third quarter and would have still shattered the 
single-game scoring mark.

'Our guys just couldn't miss,' said coach Mike Krzyzewski.

In June, James led the Heat past the Oklahoma City Thunder to capture the NBA championship title.
