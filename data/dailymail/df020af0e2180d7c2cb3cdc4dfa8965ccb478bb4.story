Break-up blues: 16-year-old Ankita Lavender faked her own kidnapping Tuesday in an attempt to gain sympathy from her ex-boyfriend after their breakup

Some women treat a break-up with a pint of ice cream and a good cry, but one Florida teen decided to fake a kidnapping in order to 'play the sympathy card' with her ex.

An Amber Alert was issued for 16-year-old Ankita Lavender Tuesday  night after she called her dad saying she had been taken by two men in a white truck. 

Lavender was found just three hours later following a massive search effort that cost the county thousands of dollars.

While she initially continued with her abduction story, she eventually copped that it was all a ruse to get attention from the boyfriend who broke up with her two days prior.

The hunt to find Lavender started at 7:20pm when she called her father telling him she had been taken by two men in a white truck near Ridaught and County Road 220 in Middlebrug, Florida.

Lavender's mother then called 911 and relayed everything the girl was saying to dispatchers.

The mother said she was at a park before the abduction.

Her dad then gets on the phone, saying the truck stopped, he heard his daughter telling them to 'stop' and that she then hung up the phone.

An Amber Alert was issued since she previously told her ex-boyfriend that she was being followed.

Clay County Sheriff's Office Colonel Craig Aldrich says 40 investigators responded within the first two hours, leading a search on the ground and in the air.

It was a driver who located Lavender three hours later, around 10:25pm, less than a mile from where she said she was grabbed.

The driver says Lavender was laying on her back on the side of the road near the intersection of Henley and Carlotta roads.

The driver then called 911 and Lavender was taken to Orange Park Medical Center to be examined.

She initially complained about injuries, saying she had been thrown from the truck.

But authorities say there were no visible signs of injuries and she later admitted it was all a hoax.

She told authorities that she was sad and 'decided to play the sympathy card' by faking the kidnapping.

Tweets from Lavender's account also show she hinted at the kidnapping days before she even broke up with her boyfriend.

On April 23, four days before the break-up she wrote that she was going 'MIA for a while' and she followed that tweet the next day with one saying she 'finally [has] a plan'.

The break-up allegedly happened on Sunday, April 27, the same day she tweeted: 'If I disappeared, it wouldn't even be a problem.'

Now the sheriff's office is seeking to charge the minor for costing the county an estimated $5,000 - $6,000 for the search.

'My personal opinion is that she should be charged, but that's a matter for the state attorney's office,' Aldrich said.

The district attorney could charge her with filing a false police report, which is a misdemeanor.

If she is charged, it won't be released since she is a minor.
