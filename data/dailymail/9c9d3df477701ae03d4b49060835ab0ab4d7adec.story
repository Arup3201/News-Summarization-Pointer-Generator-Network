The 101st Tour de France starts this weekend and for the first time in its history it begins in Yorkshire.

The race may be famed for its picturesque stages around the French Alps and famous finish on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, this year the tour will add the Yorkshire Dales and places like York, Harrogate and Ripon to the list a beautiful backdrops.

And while the King of the Mountains won’t be decided until the riders reach the Alps, the likes of defending champion Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish may be surprised to learn that the steepest part of the course will come a lot earlier than that - in Sheffield.

Steep climb: Jenkin Road in Sheffield as a gradient of 33 per cent and is the steepest climb on the Tour

Towards the end of Stage Two from York to Sheffield the riders will encounter Jenkin Road, and while it may not have the glamour of some of the great climbs on the course – it certainly makes up for that with its difficulty.

At its steepest Jenkin Road has a 33 per cent maximum gradient and comes towards the end of a gruelling day of cycling.

Pride of Britain: The riders will go through the picturesque Yorkshire Dales

It is only 800m long but the ramp is so severe and arrives so late in the day that it will provide the perfect platform for late attack to try and win the stage.

It will be a good place for spectators to watch as the severity of the climb will mean the cyclists will be moving very slowly as they make their way to the top of the hill.

At the end of the Tour the winner of the Yellow Jersey and King of the Mountains will be remembered, but maybe there should also be a prize for the conqueror of Jenkin Road.
