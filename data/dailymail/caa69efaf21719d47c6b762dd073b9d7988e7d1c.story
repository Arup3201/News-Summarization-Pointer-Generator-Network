British scientists are asking members of the public to take part in an online hearing test to explore whether modern life is damaging our ears.

Approximately one in six adults in the UK have some degree of hearing loss and it is not clear whether listening to loud music plays a significant role.

Scientists are especially interested in whether people’s listening past affects the way they hear the present.

Approximately one in six adults in the UK have some hearing loss and it is not clear whether listening to loud music plays a part. To find out whether people of all ages are subjecting their ears to too much loud noise, the MRC has launched a mass participation study

The number of UK adults who struggle to hear in social situations with background sounds has increased by 12 per cent over the last two decades and is likely to rise further, according to figures published in the International Journal of Audiology.

According to the World Health Organisation, the single largest cause of preventable hearing loss is loud noise, such as from heavy industry in work places and loud music.

Researchers from the Medical Research Council and the National Institute of Health Research are questioning whether almost a century of amplified music has something to do with the prevalence of hearing difficulties.

To find out, a mass participation study has been designed for all age groups and asks people to share information about their listening habits as well as test their hearing of speech against background noise.

The study asks how often you go to concerts and discos, as well as how often you used to listen to personal music players, such as Walkmans, Diskmans and MP3 players, over different periods of time.

It also asks more specific questions, such as, 'How often nowadays does any hearing difficulty restrict what you do socially or personally?'

The experiment is available here.

If a lifetime of noisy concerts and stereos turned up to the highest volume does lead to hearing loss, the scientists expect to see a correlation between the participants’ reported previous listening habits and current hearing abilities.

Dr Michael Akeroyd, from the MRC Institute of Hearing Research, who is leading the project, said: ‘Many studies of music-related hearing loss have focused on musicians who may be exposed to loud music almost every day.

‘But far less is known about the cumulative effects of loud-music listening on the hearing of the general public. The primary purpose of this project is to determine if there is such a link. 

According to the World Health Organisation said the single largest cause of preventable hearing loss is loud noise, such as from heavy industry in work places as well as loud music at concerts and from personal music devices

Over the past 100 years, advances in electronic amplification have transformed the way people listen to music from horn gramophones in 1923 to hugely powerful speakers at concerts and discos to personal stereos and now MP3 players.

Action on Hearing Loss has long campaigned on the dangers of loud music and the importance of protecting and preserving hearing.

Paul Breckell, the charity’s chief executive, said: ‘Damage to your hearing is irreversible and contrary to popular opinion, hearing loss is not a condition that only older people need to concern themselves with. 

‘With many nightclubs and concerts 
measuring 20 or 30 decibels above the safe noise level, more and more 
young people are likely to start feeling the effects of their 
music-loving, gig-going habits.

‘Hearing
 loss not only rules out our enjoyment of music, but has the potential 
to lead to unemployment, isolation and has even been linked to 
dementia.’
