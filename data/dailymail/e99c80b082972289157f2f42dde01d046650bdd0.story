Since moving to England it’s fair to say Luis Suarez has experienced both the highs and the lows.

While he’s adored by Liverpool fans for his impressive strike-rate, he’s become a villain to others after being suspended for racially abusing a player and biting an opponent.

Yet there’s one person who has stood by him through thick and thin – his wife Sofia Balbi.

And last night, while still dressed in
 his national kit after breaking the hearts of England fans all around 
the world with his two goals, the Liverpool striker gave an emotional 
thank you to his partner and mother of his two children.

While still dressed in his national kit after breaking the hearts of England fans with his two goals in Brazil, Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, 25, gave an emotional thank you to his partner and mother of his two children

While his career has been littered with controversy, Suarez's wife Sofia Balbi has stood by him throughout thick and thin. The pair, who are childhood sweethearts, have two children together - Delfina and Benjamin

Amidst the celebrations of Uruguay’s 2-1 win, Suarez took a moment in the changing rooms to record the personal video message.

He told the camera: ‘Hello everyone. I’m very happy because it’s incredible that we have won this match.

‘I want to thank my wife, my two kids – who are the most beautiful things I have in this world - and Walter Ferreira as without him I wouldn’t be here.

‘Sorry about the emotion but I dreamed of this unique moment and giving happiness to all Uruguay.

‘Go Uruguay, and let's prepare for the next match which is Italy.’

As well as thanking his family, he also gave a nod to physio Walter Ferreira who helped him recover for the World Cup following knee surgery last month.

The video message came after an emotional Suarez celebrated scoring both goals for his country as Uruguay took on Roy Hodgson's men in Sao Paulo, Brazil last night

The video message came after an emotional Suarez celebrated scoring both goals for his country as Uruguay took on Roy Hodgson’s men in Sao Paulo, Brazil last night.

His goals drove a dagger further into the hearts of England supporters – some of whom are still reeling from the controversial incidents Suarez has been embroiled in since moving to England.

He was banned for eight games and fined £40,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in a game in October 2011.

And, he was banned for a further ten games after biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanović during a Premier League match in April 2013.

Luis Suarez met Sofia Balbi when he was just 15 and the pair married in 2009. They have since had two children together (above) and she has fiercely supported him throughout his career despite the controversy

He was charged with violent conduct by the FA and fined an undisclosed sum by his club before being handed the ban.

However, it’s his wife Sofia who has stood by him throughout the controversy – his childhood sweetheart who he met when he was just 15.

The pair married in 2009 and she gave birth to their first child Delfina - an anagram of Anfield – a year later.

Last September, she gave birth to their second child, a baby boy called Benjamin.
