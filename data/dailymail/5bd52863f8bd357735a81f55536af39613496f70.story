Residents of Morayfield in Queensland are baffled that their neighbourhood has been ranked as the second most liveable suburb in Australia.

In a new study, mortgage broker Aussie Home Loans has researched the median house price, block size, capital gain and distance to amenities for 3800 localities.

According to the results, the Queensland town of Morayfield, 50km north of Brisbane, is the second  most liveable destination in Australia.

Morayfield in north-east Australia was ranked second most liveable city in Australia, however locals were sceptical of the study on social media

On the Caboolture Herald's Facebook page, the responses to the ranking were largely sceptical.

R Cameron Fowler said: 'Whoever voted obviously didn't visit Morayfield.'

Mary Spencer said the ranking was the:  'Best joke I have heard so far this year'

Lisa Louise said that while people were being overly harsh, the ranking was inaccurate.

 'It's not as bad as people think, but 2nd in the country?!? Definately not!!!'

Others posts on the page were more supportive.

Mrs Curran said considering the facilities it had, Morayfield was perfect.

'I don't need anything else. We're close to shops, the kids' schools, they're close to sporting facilities. We know the neighbours and they're all friendly' she said.

'I think if you are searching for the stuff you need it's probably in the area.'

Dallas McCoist, (left) said she was 'proud that Morayfield has absolutely anything you could want,' while Lisa Louise (right) said it's 'definitely not' the second most liveable city in Australia

Roger Meredith has lived in the area for 28 years and said he liked the 'country atmosphere while still being close to the city'.

'We're five minutes from train stations, schools and the shopping centre. It's close to both coasts, Brisbane and Bribie.'

'We've got a quiet sort of street but and there's a school bus that goes through the area too. I think it's what you make of it,' he said. 

Dallas McCoist, an 11 year resident, said: 'I'm proud of Morayfield and the fact that it has absolutely anything you could want. Maybe if more people took pride in the suburb they lived in maybe it would be a better environment for all.'

The study comes after after an Economist study that revealed Australia is now the most overpriced housing market in the world, when measured against incomes and rents of 23 major economies.

The inflation is due to a demand for Australian properties that now exceeded the supply.
