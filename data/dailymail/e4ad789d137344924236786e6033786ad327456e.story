These are the incredible images of adrenaline-seeking mountaineers braving the elements on some of Scotland's most picturesque mountain ranges.

But it's snapping these photographs that poses the ultimate challenge.

Mountain and adventure sports photographer, Colin Henderson, scaled the heights of the frozen peaks in order to do so - armed with little more than his usual winter clothing, a tent, cooking equipment and his camera.

The 43-year-old from Edinburgh even managed the 3,200ft feat of Beinn Alligin, located in the North-West Highlands region.

His adventures also took him up the 4,300ft-high Cairngorms mountain range in the eastern Highlands where he battled through sub-zero temperatures.

He likewise tackled the snow-capped Ben Vorlich peak in the south Highlands and the 3,600ft-tall Creise mountain in the east end of Glen Coe.

Colin said: 'I took all of my standard winter walking gear - including a waterproof top, bottoms, boots, gaiters, fleece, insulating jacket, hat and gloves.

'But for the overnight trips I'd always make sure I had a head-torch along with sleeping equipment including a tent, a sleeping bag and a sleeping mat.

'I capture images of people as they interact with the outdoor landscape such as backpacking, mountaineering, trail running or cycling,' he explained.

'My experience of many of these sports, plus my project management skills and self-reliance outdoors, gives me the ability to plan complex photo shoots, even in remote locations, and deliver high-quality, creative adventure sports images.'
