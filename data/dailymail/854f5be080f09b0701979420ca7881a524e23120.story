A new study says that global industrial civilization may collapse in mere decades due to unequal wealth distribution and increased strain on the planet's resources.

The report, funded by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, investigates factors which may be most closely linked to civilizations' downfalls, including Population, Climate, Water, Agriculture, and Energy, The Guardian reports.

Together, these factors can create resource strain and a wide gap between rich and poor.

Increased strain on resources and widening gap between rich and poor may lead to industrial civilization's collapse, the study warns

In one scenario, a famine among 'Commoners' eventually causes the collapse of society, due to a loss of workers

The study, led by mathematician Safa Motesharrei, goes on to say the the rich, or 'Elites,' may be responsible for both problems, the Guardian notes.

'...accumulated surplus is not evenly distributed throughout society, but rather has been controlled by an elite,' it says.  'The mass of the population, while producing the wealth, is only allocated a small portion of it by elites, usually at or just above subsistence levels.'

Furthermore, technology also 'tends to raise both per capita resource consumption and the scale of resource extraction.'

It also cites the downfall of other major, highly advanced civilizations, including the Roman, Han, Gupta and various Mesopotamian empires as evidence that they can be 'fragile and impermanent.'

In both scenarios the study says that Commoners would collapse first, later followed by the wealthy Elites

Would societal collapse mean a doomsday scenarios like the one portrayed in 'The Day After Tomorrow?' (pictured)

The study then lists a series of doomsday scenarios.

In the first, the Elites 'grow and consume too much, resulting in a famine among Commoners that eventually causes the collapse of society. [This] is due to a loss of workers, rather than a collapse of Nature.'

In the second, 'the decline of the Commoners occurs faster, while the Elites are still thriving. [Eventually] the Commoners collapse completely, followed by the Elites.' Because of a buffer zone due to their wealth, Elites may continue '"business as usual" despite the impending catastrophe.'

The study then goes on to say that in order to avoid societal collapse, the wealth gap must be greatly reduced and population must be controlled.
