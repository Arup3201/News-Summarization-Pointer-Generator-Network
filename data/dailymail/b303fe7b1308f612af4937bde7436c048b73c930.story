A hilarious video shows the moment an entire wedding party ended up in a lake after a jetty collapsed.

Dan and Jackie Anderson had lined up 20 of their wedding party for a photoshoot, in Crosslake, Minnesota when the decking collapsed.

The entire group- save for one bridesmaid who ran up the jetty - ended up being soaked.

Videographer Megan Fritze caught it all on tape at the weekend.

The clip shows the structure starts to move - and one of the bridesmaids sprinting up the decking.

But the jetty quickly collapses into the water - soaking the entire wedding party just an hour before the ceremony.

One of the guests told Fox 9 that when guests starting showing up, groomsmen and bridesmaids were in towels, waiting for their dresses and tuxes to dry.

In June 2012 a video went viral of a jetty collapsing under the weight of a wedding party.

 Walber swam for shore, rather than rescuing his dunked bride.

The entire bridal party got a soaking when a dock at the Bay Pointe Inn on Gun Lake in Shelbyville, Michigan, collapsed.

However, the new Mrs Walber gracefully took it in her stride and laughed.

Her only concern was her dress which was falling down under the weight of the water.
