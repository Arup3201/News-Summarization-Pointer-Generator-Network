A gangster jailed life for murder has been accused of a razor blade attack on two prison wardens just months after referring to himself as a 'laid back guy' on a pen pal website for inmates.

Clifton Jeter, 36, is currently housed at HMP Manchester after he was jailed in 2008 for the murder of a father-of-seven during a bungled a 'honey trap' robbery.

Jeter was born in Britain and taken to 
the U.S. as a child but had been deported back to the UK after he became
 involved with some of New York’s toughest street gangs and was 
convicted of attempted robbery and intimidation.

In prison, he has set up a profile page on an American website, which helps inmates find pen friends online and he complained of the need to find companionship.

In his entry Jeter said: 'It’s also hard to make friends in here - I’m a laid back guy. I love to have stimulating conversations.'

He is considered the prime suspect in the attack on two prison wardens, according to the Manchester Evening News.

The two wardens were slashed with a makeshift weapon made out of a razor blade melted into the head of a toothbrush while they escorted inmates to a segregation unit.

One of the warders needed stitches after 
being left with a five-inch gash across the back of his neck.

The other 
officer suffered cuts to his face, arm and leg.

Both work at HMP Manchester, formally known as Strangeways.

It is believed the weapon was hidden in a shower room. Both casualties have since been sent home from hospital.

The attacks came two years after Jeter was accused of punching one guard and grappling with another at Frankland jail in Durham while being escorted to his cell.

Today, officials from the Prison Service were investigating the latest double attack but declined to give details.

In 2002, he was jailed in the UK for seven years for aggravated burglary after raiding a hotel room and holding a man at gunpoint until he handed over his cash credit cards.

Then in 2007 he was arrested for murder after chauffeur Ghiass Tarabin, who was stabbed to death during a bungled 'honey trap' robbery at his home in West Hendon.

The court had been told Mr Tarabin had previously had sex with Jeter's girlfriend Candy.

When she turned up at his house, Mr Tarabin let her in but Jeter was with her and demanded cash and valuables.

There was a struggle and Mr Tarabin was stabbed once in the chest and collapsed in his garden where he died from massive blood loss.

Jeter was convicted of murder in May 2008 at the Old Bailey and shouted: ‘F*** you' and other sexual expletives at the jury was he was led to the cells.

During his stay at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, Jeter attempted to reach out to 'new friends' after setting up an online profile on specialist site Inmate Connection.

His profile acknowledges that he is a murderer with no release date but says he wants to make new friends.

Alongside a profile photo of Jeter, it reads: 'I’m Clifton. I’m interested in meeting some friends. Prison can be a lonely place. It’s also hard to make friends in here.

'I miss being able to socialize and mingle so hopefully I’ll be able to meet some people that I can keep in contact with.

'I’m a laid back guy. I love to have stimulating conversations. I’m very athletic; it’s what gets me through my sentence, that and reading books. Anyway, I hope to hear from some of you guys. Take care, Clifton.'

The online ad was placed in December last year and runs out next week.

It is believed the two Manchester prison officers were attacked from behind and the incident is believed to have been caught on CCTV.

A picture of a wound has been posted on social media networks. It is understood Jeter has been transferred out of Manchester to another high-security prison.

No one has been arrested in connection with the attack.

Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association said: 'This was a vicious cowardly attack on two prison officers in the execution of their duties.

The Prison Officers' Association says attacks on wardens is rising and demanded it is taken seriously by the CPS

'We would expect the Crown Prosecution Service to be applying the full weight of the law in charging the perpetrators of this extreme assault.

'The POA is acutely aware that serious assaults on staff are on the increase and that the relevant authorities, the National Offender Management Service, and the CPS, need to be making sure that prison officers are adequately protected. We don’t believe they are adequately protected a the moment.'

He said the number of attacks on prison officers is on the rise.

Greater Manchester Police said: 'Both men received lacerations to the body and were taken to hospital for treatment before they were discharged.

'Detectives are working with the Prison Service and a police investigation is ongoing.'

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'We do not tolerate violence against our staff. Police have been informed and an investigation is taking place. We always press for the most serious charges to be laid against perpetrators of violence in prisons.'
