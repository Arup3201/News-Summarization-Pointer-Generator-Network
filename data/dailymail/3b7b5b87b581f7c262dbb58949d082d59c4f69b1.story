Southampton have renewed their interest in Porto's Dutch defender Bruno Martins Indi

Now Koeman is back in for Indi, a target for Everton and Liverpool in the past, who can play at centre-back and full-back.

Indi was also linked with Manchester United during the summer after revealing he continues to have contact with manger Louis van Gaal. 

Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is expected to be busy in the January transfer window

The Dutch centre-back joined Porto from Feyenoord in the summer for a £6m fee but United remain in his sights after the 22-year-old admitted he continues to think about working with Van Gaal - the former Holland boss.

'Spiritually I still have contact with Van Gaal,' he said. 'I think about him and I think he also thinks about me.'
