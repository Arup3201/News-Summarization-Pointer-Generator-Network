Authorities in South Dakota revealed this afternoon that human remains discovered in a partially submerged car last year were two young women who disappeared in 1971.  

During a news conference today, Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley stated that the evidence gathered from the site where a 1960 Studebaker Lark was found in a creek was consistent with a car accident.

Record flooding followed by a drought brought the corroded 1960 Studebaker Lark into view.

Cheryl Miller and Pamella Jackson, of Vermillion, were last seen in the car on their way to a party in May 1971.

Nearly 43 years later, the missing persons case has been officially closed and foul play has been ruled out.

According to officials, the victims' vehicle was stuck in a third gear, the lights were on, and their skeletal remains were in the cabin and not in the trunk. One of the tires on the car was damaged.

The car keys were found in the ignition. Investigators also recovered Miller's purse, which contained her driver's license, photos and notes from her classmates.

The remains were discovered September 24, 2013, when crews
 lifted the mangled hulk from an embankment in Brule Creek near Elk 
Point.

Evidence: In this undated photo provided by the South Dakota Attorney Generals Office, Cheryl Miller's driver's license is seen

Clothing: Clothing, pictured, that was found from the 1960 Studebaker was unearthed in September 2013

License: The license plate from the 1960 Studebaker was also unearthed in September 2013. The car remained hidden until last fall when a drought brought their it into view, authorities said

Belongings: Cheryl Miller's driver's license, purse and other belongings are pictured. State and local officials held a news conference Tuesday afternoon confirming that the 1960 Studebaker unearthed in September included the remains of Cheryl Miller and Pamella Jackson, both 17-year-olds who attended Vermillion High School

Jackley said Tuesday that the bridge under which the Studebaker was spotted was new at the time of the accident, and there was still construction going on at the site. It does not appear that alcohol played a role in the wreckage.

'I think it's fair to say that law enforcement and the families never quit searching,' the attorney general added.

The families of the two girls were on hand for the announcement but declined to publicity speak, only issuing a brief statement that said: 'Out journey is done.'

Investigators
 have been working over the past months trying to establish whether the car wreck could be linked to the 
disappearance of Jackson and Miller in 1971.

Elk Point isn't far from the South Dakota town of Vermillion where the two lived. 

The girls were last seen on May 29, 1971, driving a beige 1960 Studebaker Lark. A fisherman who remembered the 
42-year-old case called authorities after noticing one of the car's 
wheels sticking out of the creek.

Crews work to excavate a vehicle from an embankment near Beresford, South Dakota on Monday, September 23, 2013

Authorities work to recover the car  from an embankment in Brule Creek, South Dakota

The vehicle will be processed for forensic evidence. Authorities said they could not comment on whether any remains were found inside the car

High spring water levels followed by a
 drought this summer helped reveal the old car, and authorities 
recovered a Studebaker hubcap and a license plate matching the car once 
owned by Miller's grandfather.

A
 man already serving a prison sentence on unrelated charges was indicted
 for murder in the deaths of Miller and Jackson in 2007, but the charges
 were dropped after prosecutors found out that a supposed confession 
given to a fellow inmate was faked.

The
 disappearance of the Vermillion High School juniors was one of the 
initial investigations of South Dakota's cold case unit, which was 
formed in June 2004 to focus on unsolved suspicious deaths and 
disappearances because there's no time limit on filing criminal charges 
in homicide cases.

A 
September 2004 search of a Union County farm turned up bones, clothing, a
 purse, photographs, newspaper articles and other items, but not the 
car. Authorities have not  said if the bones were  human remains.

In
 a warrant authorizing the search, authorities said that David Lykken, 
who lived at the farm in 1971, might have been involved in the 
disappearance of Miller and Jackson, as well as three other unnamed 
people.

David Lykken is pictured in July 2007. He had been charged with Jackson and Miller in 1971 but charges the were later dropped

Lykken, 59, is in prison serving an unrelated 227-year sentence for
 rape and kidnapping.

In 
July 2007, a Union County grand jury indicted Lykken on two counts of 
premeditated murder, two counts of felony murder and two counts of 
murder in the disappearance of Miller and Jackson.

He was arrested at 
the prison and scheduled for a March 2008 trial, but state prosecutors 
dropped all six murder charges after discovering a prison snitch made up
 a supposed admission.

Aloysius
 Black Crow pleaded guilty in March 2008 to two counts of perjury for 
lying to a Union County grand jury and at a court hearing. He had 
conspired with another inmate to tape a fake confession implicating 
Lykken.
