Grinning with glee as their uncle twirls them through the air - these fantastic pictures would make a joyous addition to any family album.

Security guard Nathan Brasher took the playful pictures during a family visit to his father's house for dinner this week using a camera strapped to his chest.

The 28-year-old, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, said he was pleased when he saw how the action shots of his nieces and nephew came out - but wasn't expecting the attention they received when he posted them online.

Gleeful: Mr Brasher's nephew Clement Wiggins, seven, certainly appears to be enjoying himself as he flies through the air

Mr Brasher told MailOnline: 'Basically I strapped a GoPro camera to my chest after I made my own chest harness and I thought it would be good to take photographs of my nephew and nieces while I swung them around.

'So I set the camera so it took a photograph every half a second so at the end I had loads of pictures to go through and choose the best ones.'

The pictures feature 10-year-old Charley Brasher, the daughter of Mr Brasher's sister Andrea, as well as his step-sister Michelle Wiggins's children Clement, seven, and Ellimay, three.

Mr Brasher said: 'We all go up to my dad's for dinner pretty much every Monday, so I see them once a week and we often mess about, play football or that sort of thing.

'I think the pictures are brilliant - I've obviously re-touched them to make them look a bit nicer but I'm pleased with how they've come out.'

Mr Brasher bought the camera so he could take pictures and videos while kayaking.

But he said he was surprised when the pictures attracted attention from across the globe after he put them online.

He said: 'I put them on reddit under the pictures category and overnight it just went massive - the pictures had got more than 1,000 comments on them.

'A lot of the comments were saying just how it will be a good memory for the kids growing up and looking at the pictures later on.

'I'm not really too much into photography - I go kayaking and that is why I bought the camera because I put it on the kayak and take videos and pictures off that.'
