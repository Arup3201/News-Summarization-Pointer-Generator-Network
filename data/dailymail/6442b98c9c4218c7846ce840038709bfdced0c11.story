It was meant to give the public a taste of life in wartime Britain.

But onlookers were left horrified after a  Second World War festival saw volunteers  take to the streets in Nazi uniforms with  swastikas flying from their cars.

One open-top vehicle fitted with an SS  registration plate was driven by a grinning man wearing a senior SS uniform flanked by a woman with a machine gun.

Jewish leaders and anti-fascism campaigners yesterday attacked the ‘disturbing’ event.

The ‘Yanks’ festival, which attracts 
up to 5,000 visitors each year, sees hundreds of  volunteers dress up in
traditional military  uniforms to re-enact life in Uppermill, 
Saddleworth, near Oldham, during the 1940s.

The weekend, which also included swing
dance lessons and a vintage fun fair, was inspired by the Richard Gere 
movie Yanks, which was filmed in the town in the late 1970s.

Mark Gardner, from the Community 
Security Trust, which campaigns against anti-Semitic attacks, said: 
‘Most decent people - not only Jews – will be disturbed by the sight of 
people walking the streets in Nazi uniform and displaying swastikas. 
It’s sick.’

Angry: Protesters compared it to a Nazi rally, shown here as German soldiers occupied the Sudetenland in October 1938

John Brooks, who lives in the mill 
town, added: ‘The film Yanks was about the relationship between the 
local community and the US forces stationed here.

‘As such you might expect to see  
festival goers dressed as US soldiers, locals in 1940s civvies and a few
British service personnel on leave.

‘There is no place for German 
uniforms. I cannot understand why  anyone would want to wear a German 
uniform. I do not want to see it in my town. The organisers must try 
harder to stop this affront to the millions who died at the hands of the
Nazis.’

Mike Killian, from campaign group 
Unite Against Fascism, called for the public to boycott the event. ‘It’s
really horrific – I’m disgusted,’ he added. ‘It’s intolerable that 
genuine attempts to recreate history through re-enactment are undermined
by this. People should be prepared to protest.’

But Bury Councillor Michelle  Wiseman 
said that although it was  illegal in Germany and France to  display 
Nazi insignia, no such law exists in Britain.

‘It’s difficult because when you start
banning things where do you draw the line?’ she added. ‘I never 
understand why people would want to dress up like this.

‘Unfortunately until it’s banned nothing can be done.’

The Northern Military Vehicle and 
Vintage Club, which organised the event, said that anyone wearing SS 
uniforms or insignia would be asked to leave or remove the offending 
items.
