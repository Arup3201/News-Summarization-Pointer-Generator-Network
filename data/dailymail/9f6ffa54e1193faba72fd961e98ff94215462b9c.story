Jos Buttler begins his Test career as England’s wicket-keeper batsman on Sunday but just a few years ago the former child prodigy was a reluctant gloveman.

The 23-year-old former Somerset star — whose remarkable ball-striking ability has drawn comparisons with Viv Richards and Ian Botham — caught the attention of England’s hierarchy at a early age, once scoring 227 not out for his school first XI in a record 340-run partnership in 2008.

The player who had the best view in the house that day, former school friend and current Somerset batsman Alex Barrow, says the man making his Test debut in place of 79-cap veteran Matt Prior today was not always a willing wicket-keeper.

‘Jos was actually very reluctant to keep at school,’ Barrow said. ‘On several occasions he’d hand the gloves over to someone else so he could have a bowl. He was a very good keeper but didn’t really enjoy it.

'He didn’t really want to do it but he’s come on a long way and done a huge amount of work which is testament to him for becoming a Test keeper. But there were many times at school he didn’t fancy it.’

With his opportunities at Taunton limited by former England keeper Craig Kieswetter, Buttler moved to Lancashire from Somerset this winter to gain regular wicket-keeping opportunities at first-class level.

He has worked tirelessly with wicketkeeping coach Bruce French and is entrusted with the gloves at the Ageas Bowl following Prior’s decision to take a break. He is the least experienced wicketkeeper England have selected in the past 50 years in terms of first-class appearances, apart from Essex skipper James Foster who made his Test debut against India in 2001.

Buttler’s one-day credentials are already established and his astonishing innings of 121 from 74 balls in a losing cause against Sri Lanka at Lord’s in May led to calls from many — including Kevin Pietersen — for him to be elevated even sooner.

‘Jos’s ball-striking was always pretty exceptional,’ said Barrow. ‘He was able to clear the boarding house at one end and the science block from the first XI square at school, which was around a 100m carry.

'No-one else could get close but Jos could hit it over pretty regularly and pretty comfortably. He could always hit the ball a long way. He could also always hit the ball in strange areas, too.

‘We batted together in a Twenty20 tournament at Millfield and he walked down the wicket to me in one game and said “I’m going to try to hit this guy over point for six”. In my naivety I wondered how the hell he was going to cut the ball for six, but the next ball he came down and he said: “I’m going to reverse sweep him for six”. And that’s exactly what he did. It was pretty amazing.

‘He spent a lot more time practising those sorts of skills at a younger age than most other people.’

Buttler’s parents, John and  Patricia, will be at the Ageas Bowl today to witness his Test debut. ‘Jos was a bowler at a young age but when one of his team’s wicket keepers was ill and the other was injured on that day, Jos took over, and that was it,’ John told the Mail on Sunday.

‘One thing that he has had ever since he was born is incredible hand-eye co-ordination. It means if there’s something to be hit or something to be caught, he has the natural ability to do it.’

Jos honed his skills as a youngster by playing against his older brother James, seven years his senior, in the garden of their family home in the Somerset village of Wedmore.

Patricia said: ‘We had a mown strip up the top of the garden and they would charge in at each other, smashing around the place. Windows were broken, the greenhouse was in pieces but they played and played.

‘Because there were so many years between them, if Jos wanted to play he had to play as hard as his older brother. They were so competitive and still are. They still play whenever they’re both here.

‘People have told us that Jos is the same as Kevin Pietersen. They go because he’s playing, he’s got something special to inspire a crowd.’

Buttler turned down the chance to be a school prefect in order to concentrate on his cricket and A-Levels in his final year at King’s, Taunton, a West Country boarding school he attended through a cricket scholarship won aged 13.

‘He was an unbelievable cricketer and clearly a class above everybody else,’ said headmaster Richard Biggs.

‘There was no doubt he would go on to succeed in the game. But he wasn’t just a cricketer, he was also an exceptionally talented rugby player who I have no doubt could have gone on to make a living out of that. He played hockey very well and was also a bright boy who did very well in his A-Levels.

‘He was modest, softly spoken and a great ambassador for the school. The only place he pushed himself on to the centre stage was on the cricket field. He was never arrogant and everybody liked him.’

Buttler was soon on Somerset’s radar where former England batsman Brian Rose — county captain in the late Seventies of a side containing Botham and Richards — immediately spotted his promise.

‘I was fortunate enough at Somerset to see Ian Botham emerging and one or two others,’ said Rose.

‘I’ve seen Jos play cricket since he was 13 and it was immediately apparent to me he was going to play at the highest level.

‘There are not many people you can say that about. People as talented as Jos will always get through.

'His hand-eye co-ordination and ability to hit the ball anywhere in the ground takes me back a long time to when I was watching people like Ian Botham and Viv Richards, one of the greatest cricketers ever to play.

‘I think Jos has that special ability. His big challenge is to bat for longer periods in first-class cricket.’ At just under six feet, Buttler is relatively tall for a wicket-keeper.

‘Initially I doubted he’d be a wicketkeeper because of his height,’ Rose added. ‘But he’s naturally flexible and is good on his feet. His glovework has come on a lot and he’s been helped a lot by Frenchy over the last couple of years.

‘He’s a natural athlete so the more he keeps practising with soft hands he’ll be fine.’
