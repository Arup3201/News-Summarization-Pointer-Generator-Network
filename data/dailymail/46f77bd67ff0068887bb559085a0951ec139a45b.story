Lunch appointment with Max Mosley. Table for 12.30pm. Usual sort of spot: Sloane Square area of Chelsea.

The old FIA president's conversation topics were as catholic as usual: judges, whose ranks he half-wished he had joined rather than been lured by motor racing from an early career at the bar; newspaper editors and proprietors, whose journals he has waged war upon; Bernie Ecclestone, his old mucker who finds himself in a spot of bother with the German constabulary.

But it was on the subject of Formula One's engine development that he made his most pertinent contribution.

Opinions: Max Mosley met with Jonathan McEvoy

He clearly felt that the sport's current governors might have articulated the need for energy recovery era more forcefully.

'If anybody should be "blamed" it's me,' he said wryly of the move to V6 turbos this seasons.

'We were the ones who looked at bringing in the new technology. It was 10 years in the making, and I actually like the noise.

'I wear these things in both my ears (hearing aids) because the noise of the engines went right through me for 40 years or more. It's too late to save my hearing but not for the next generation. The quieter engines are better for families. You can take children to races without fear of their being deafened.

'It is important for Formula One to evolve. Safety was the big challenge of the 20th Century and the environment is the big challenge of the 21st. If that that fact is not understood and embraced, the sport runs the risk of becoming irrelevant.

'Corporate social responsibility is important for car manufacturers, so there is a need to move in this direction so the sport does not lose sponsors and manufacturers. They see how important this technology is in the development of road cars.

'If there is one thing I feel could have been done better it is how the new regulations, and the reasons behind them, have been explained to the public. An opportunity has been missed.'

A few points to consider.

First, he turned upside down Ecclestone's argument that louder engines are obviously desirable, saying that quieter power trains are not only a necessary by-product of less energy being expelled through the exhaust but that the tranquillity is desirable in itself.

He cited watching the sheer violence of a car going round the swimming pool at Monaco, rather than the high-decibel screech, as the truly jaw-dropping spectacle. I agree that watching from the pit wall at Monaco is one of the greatest sights in all sport, and I stop there every year to take it in.

Secondly, he argued that Formula One is not shying away from being the most innovative and startling brand in motor racing by moving to a greener world but actually defining the new frontiers by doing so.

Thirdly, he underlined the fact there would only be one or possibly two engine manufacturers left had the move to energy-saving technology not been brought in. Mercedes, for one, said this week they probably would have quit had the move not come about. Renault would have wobbled, too.

Despite these and other worthy points to be made for the new regulations, the agenda through the opening months of the season was set by the antis, notably Ferrari's Luca di Montezemolo, Red Bull's world champion Sebastian Vettel and, of couse, Ecclestone.

Where was the case for the defence from the sport's governors, as opposed to Mercedes' Niki Lauda and, to an extent, McLaren's Ron Dennis? Their argument was barely presented, certainly not with the force or coherence it could have been.  Instead, the telling rebuttal was delivered, by proxy, through the splendid racing at Bahrain last weekend.

But even that evidence, by its nature, failed to make the intellectual case for the revolutionary changes.

Another chance to articulate this vision was, I fear, missed this week when the FIA launched its carbon reduction programme. The project was a long time in the planning but was launched with little more than a murmur. The opportunity to join the dots with what is happening in Formula One was wastefully scorned.

As for Mosley's views on Ecclestone's longevity, he believes his old friend will survive the bribery charges in Germany. Or was that just loyalty talking?

The Piranha Club – the name given to Formula One's school of sharp-toothed bosses – should be warned that Mosley has finished his memoirs.

I am told that about 10 per cent of the book, which has yet to be given a title, will address his upbringing as the son of Sir Oswald Mosley and Diana Mitford; 25 per cent his campaign to curtail the Press following the News of the World expose into his private life; 65 per cent his experience in and around Formula One.

A particularly intrigued piranha will be Ron Dennis, whose designs on a knighthood are unlikely to be helped by another rehearsal of the Spygate scandal, concerning how McLaren came into illicit possession of Ferrari technical data in 2007.

Other big fish who could also be wounded by Mosley's scabrous pen are Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo and triple world champion Sir Jackie Stewart.

The author, during his period as FIA president, derided them respectively as a 'bella figura' and a 'certificated halfwit, dressed up as a 1930s' Music Hall man.' Watch out.

If I were a modern-day Lord Hesketh – that is to say richer than I am – I would put some money towards the motor racing career of James Hunt's son, Freddie.

With his collar-length blond hair, Freddie looks every inch his world champion father's boy. He also possesses something of the late James's debonair style.

So it was one of the pleasures of the week to meet up with Freddie in a London hotel after his return from a spell in Argentina, close to the animals he loves.

He told me how he spent New Year crossing the Andes, 15,000 feet up, sometimes holding on to rock faces for dear life, at other times pausing to breathe in the thin air every 10 steps.

He managed just over 50 miles in fractionally fewer hours but had to turn back when there were no horses to take him across the water. The cowboys were on a day off. It was New Year, after all.

But, his head cleared and straight, he is back in Britain in an attempt to restart his racing career seven years after he began out in Formula Ford.

Aged 26, he admits his original aim of Formula One is beyond him, so is now hell-bent on a crack at Le Mans. The road to Le Mans, through lower categories, will likely take five years at best, and plenty of money. So if anyone fancies helping Freddie on his journey, he can be contacted on Twitter, @FreddieHunt76.

PS I am willing to publicise other drivers seeking sponsorship, on only two conditions: first, that they are the son of a Formula One world champion and, secondly, they represent some of the panache missing in modern British sport.
