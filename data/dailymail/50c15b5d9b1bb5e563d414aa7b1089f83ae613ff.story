With Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge banging in goals left, right and centre, Liverpool were widely acknowledged as this season's great entertainers and the television companies seem to agree.

Brendan Rodgers' side were shown by either Sky or BT Sport 29 times this season - meaning just nine of their Barclays Premier League matches were not on TV.

Champions Manchester City were just three matches behind on 26, while Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham both notched up 25 games.

Stoke found themselves bottom of the 
table with just seven appearances, with their only match on BT Sport 
coming on the opening day of the season against Liverpool. Sky also 
showed their home fixture with the Anfield giants, a 5-3 thriller.

Newcomers
 BT Sport obviously thought the way to go was to show the big clubs and 
that was certainly reflected in their coverage, with 81.6 per cent of 
their matches featuring one of Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, 
Chelsea or Manchester United.

Meanwhile,
 91 of Sky Sports' 116 live matches featured one of those five, coming in at a slightly lower 78.4 per cent.

Capitulation: Monday Night Football on Sky showed Liverpool's dramatic 3-3 draw against Crystal Palace

Mistaken identity: BT Sport showed the controversial match between Chelsea and Arsenal which saw Kieran Gibbs receive a red card for a handball by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain

Game changer: BT had the rights to seven of the Premier League champions, Manchester City's, matches

Perhaps surprisingly, Aston Villa were shown on television 17 times - one more than Everton - although 11 of those matches came against Arsenal, Chelsea, City, Liverpool, Tottenham or United.

The table will lend ammunition to those who think the big clubs monopolise TV coverage, with the likes of Crystal Palace and Southampton playing more exciting and flowing football than United this season.

Indeed, the Saints will possibly be most disappointed with their lack of exposure, especially as they have three players in England's World Cup squad.

Unpopular: Stoke found themselves live on the television just seven times and only once on BT Sport

Surprising: Aston Villa were remarkably high up on the list coming in seventh having played in 17 live matches

Blessing or a curse? United fans had the pleasure (or not) of watching their side 25 times on TV this season
