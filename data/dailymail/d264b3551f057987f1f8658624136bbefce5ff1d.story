Franck Ribery has likened his World Cup absence to "a death in the soul".

A back problem saw the Bayern Munich star withdrawn from the squad on the same day as Lyon midfielder Clement Grenier, who has a thigh injury. Montpellier's Remy Cabella and Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin will replace the pair.

Ribery said on the French Football Federation's official website: "It is like a death in the soul that I am forced to leave the France team and give up on the World Cup.

"I always hoped to be able to play 
against Jamaica (in this Sunday's final warm-up friendly) but when I 
pushed it physically on Friday morning it aggravated my back pain.

"The MRI scan confirmed those feelings and therefore my inability to train and play normally.

"In these conditions and despite the efforts of the medical staff, who I thank sincerely, my absence was inevitable."

Coach
 Didier Deschamps said in a press conference screened on the French 
Football Federation's official website: "It's a sad day.

"You have on one side two players who are happy to be joining us, and two others who are very sad."

Ribery
 had been following an individual training programme to overcome a back 
problem which has sidelined him since Bayern's DFB-Pokal final on May 
17.

He had hoped to rejoin 
the full squad on Friday but Deschamps said: "We increased the intensity
 of his work but this morning, before he could join the collective 
training, he stopped dead on a movement with a sharp pain.

"As of today, everything leads us to believe that he will be unable to train for several weeks, and still less able to play."

Regarding
 Grenier, he added: "He had a groin problem in the second half of the 
season but had an operation and returned for the last match.

"He
 played in the (warm-up) matches against Norway and Paraguay and on 
Wednesday he trained as normal, Thursday morning as well, but on 
Thursday afternoon in the game he felt a violent pain in his right 
adductor and had to leave the session.

"He had an MRI scan, which unfortunately showed a tear in the adductor meaning an absence of several weeks."

With Franck Ribery out of the World Cup, only Karim Benzema has reached double figures for international goals in the France squad.

Top scorers in France squad:

19 - Karim Benzema

7 - Olivier Giroud

5 - Loic Remy, Mathieu Valbuena

On
 replacements Schneiderlin and Cabella, he said: "These two players were
 on the reserve list and they are similar to the two players who left 
us.

"It is not a cut-and-paste, but Morgan can link up play like Grenier and Cabella is closest to the profile of Franck Ribery."

Deschamps
 had previously been forced to call up St Etienne's Stephane Ruffier to 
replace injured Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda.

The
 former OM coach admitted Ribery's absence, in particular, is a major 
setback but vowed not to lose heart ahead of the tournament.

He said: "We know what Franck is capable of. But I have other players.

"Part
 of my job is to anticipate things and try out different options. There 
are lots of possibilities. (Antoine) Griezmann has done some good 
things.

"With Franck Ribery at 100 per cent, we are better. But we have to be ambitious and we will continue to be."

Ribery
 added: "I depart from my team-mates with a heavy heart but I know they 
will do all they can for the blue jersey and go as far as possible in 
the competition. I will be their number one supporter."

Real Sociedad star Griezmann, Cabella and OM's Mathieu Valbuena will provide the wide options for Deschamps.

For Ribery, it marks the end of his World Cup career if a recent interview he gave to radio station RTL is to be believed.

"It will be my last World Cup," he said on May 21. "We have to go there to try to win the World Cup."

Crocked: Lyon midfielder and reported Newcastle target Clement Grenier also pulled out of the squad

The
 31-year-old made his international breakthrough by helping Les Bleus to
 the 2006 final in Germany, where they lost on penalties to Italy, but 
was also part of the wretched 2010 campaign in South Africa which ended 
in mutiny against then coach Raymond Domenech.

This
 summer's would have been a first World Cup for Grenier, who has won 
five caps for Les Bleus since making his debut against Uruguay last 
year.

The 23-year-old made 
36 appearances for Lyon last season, recording six goals and five 
assists. He turned down a move to Newcastle in January as the Magpies 
sought a replacement for departed France star Yohan Cabaye.

Both
 he and Ribery appeared on the official squad photo published earlier on
 Friday by the FFF but Cabella will now take Ribery's number seven 
shirt, with Schneiderlin taking over from Grenier at number 22.

Cabella
 made his senior France debut as a 79th-minute substitute in last 
Tuesday's 4-0 friendly win over Norway, after 17 caps and four goals at 
under-21 level.

The uncapped Schneiderlin has spent six years at Southampton and has played in the top three divisions of the English league.

He began his career with Strasbourg and has won three under-21 caps and five for the under-20 side, scoring once at each level.
