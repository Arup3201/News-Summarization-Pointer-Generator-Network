Travelling long journeys all by your lonesome can be a chore paved with uncomfortable motels and bad service station food.

Single camping often means sleeping in the back of the car, or going to through the effort of putting up a tent by the side of the road.

One designer’s dream of ending the pain for lone campers has resulted in the Buffalino, a three-wheel mini-van similar to tuk-tuk rickshaws which are seen across Asia and Africa.

Versatile van: Once the miles are managed, the camper van becomes a snug place to sleep for the night until the journey continues

Home for one: What was once a three-wheeled scooter has been transformed into a camper van for one

The fully furnished camper contains a 
fold-up bed, a sink, a kitchen with refrigerator and running water 
and, of course, a place to hook up your laptop.

German industrial designer Cornelius 
Cormanns modified a three wheeled Piaggio scooter to create the 
Buffalino, which is set to meet the requirements of a single individual.

Mr Cormanns wanted to design a vehicle
that would offer greater flexibility during travel, while also creating an economic and fuel efficient ride.

The Buffalino serves as a greener alternative for long solitary journeys as well as offering a way out of fast foods and motels.

Happy camper: The camper is designed to meet the single travellers requirements and comes with a complete kitchen and bedroom

Cowboy ready: Dubbed as 'economic and fuel efficient' the van, named 'Buffalino',  is perfect for the lonely rider

Multitasking: The Buffalino motto is to be cheap and efficient and leave as little of a carbon emissions imprint as possible

Smart-an: It may not come with a jacuzzi but it has all you need, even if you technically sleep in the kitchen

Take a seat: When it comes to dinner time, the driver's seat - which also makes up half the bed - simply swings into the kitchen

Room for one: Designer Cornelius Cormanns wanted to provide greater flexibility for the single traveller when he designed the three-wheeled camper van
