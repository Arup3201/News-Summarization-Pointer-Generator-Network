A former spokesman for L'Wren Scott has come to her defense and said that in spite of her debts on the British side of her business, her fashion line was not in trouble at the time of her suicide.

'Her business overall was only seven years old and although some areas of the business had not yet reached their potential other parts of her business were proving successful,' the unidentified spokesman told WWD.

Scott was found dead in her Manhattan apartment on Monday and further investigation into her luxury fashion line's finances showed that the British side of her business was thousands of pounds in debt, according to statements provided to UK business regulator Companies House.

By the numbers: A spokesman for L'Wren Scott's company said that while she may have been in debt on the UK side of her business, that was not grave enough to force her to close her company

Scott never had to file financial disclosure forms for the American side of her business nor her own personal wealth, so the true extent of her financial health is not fully clear.

On top of that, her close friend Cathy Horyn wrote in a moving tribute to the 49-year-old designer that she learned after Scott's suicide that she would be announcing the closure of her business this week.

The unidentified spokesman said that the numbers were not reflective of the greater picture and she had been planning to rebrand in the coming months in keeping with larger goals.

'In terms of figures shown at Companies House in the UK. The parent company of LS Fashion Limited based in America had made a standard loan investment to the UK subsidiary. LS Fashion Limited is fully able to meet the company’s liabilities and pay all suppliers and customers,' he told WWD on Friday.

'The fact that L’Wren Scott would have been hounded by creditors or riddled with debt is preposterous.

'Ms. Scott was considering a re-structure of her global business.'

That said, he did not deny the accuracy of the Companies House figures which showed the business was not profitable in the UK, where she maintained a house and planned to show her collection at London Fashion Week before pulling out at the last minute- citing delayed fabric deliveries.

The latest accounts for her business, filed in the UK in October 2013, show that the company, LS Fashion LTD, had a deficit of $5,899,548 (4,237,164 Euros), with the designer owing creditors $7.641 million (euros 5,488,125).

However, in recent years, her company’s debts increased on a yearly basis. In 2009, the debt stood at $2,120,015.67, and by 2010 it had grown to $3,063,160.87.

She did not file any profit figure, but, because of Companies House guidelines, she would have only been required to do so if the company made more than $10.8million (£6.5million pounds).

Designers are regularly paid between $20,000 and $1million for a collaboration with major fashion chains, and an industry source told MailOnline that Scott likely earned around $250,000 for her work with Banana Republic.

Ms Horyn, The New York Times fashion critic and a friend of Scott's since the 1990s, wrote about how she worried about the toll that the stress from the company was taking on Scott, and because she had shut herself away in recent weeks, Ms Horyn was not fully aware of the extent of the trouble.

'I sent her a text on March 12, checking in. She didn’t reply, but that wasn’t unusual. I learned since her death that she was planning to close her business, with an announcement this week. Still, as painful as the decision must have been for her, I wouldn’t draw any conclusions from it about her state of mind,' Ms Horyn wrote in The Times.

'Like many small designers, she had problems managing her business: cash flow, finding the right managers, getting her goods out of Italian factories on schedule.'

Though her close friends were concerned that she had been pushing them away in recent months, many outsiders were surprised that money troubles would be one of the factors in her suicide particularly since she was the longterm partner of millionaire Rolling Stone frontman Mick Jagger.

She and the rocker had been dating since 2001 when she was working as a stylist and they met on the set of a photo shoot.

He was in Australia as the band was due to play seven shows on their '14 On Fire' tour when he learned the news of her death.

'I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way,' he said in a statement released on his website Tuesday.
