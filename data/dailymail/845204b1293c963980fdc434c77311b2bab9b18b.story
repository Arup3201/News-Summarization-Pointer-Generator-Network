Germany and France - who have been behind an action plan to save the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis - are at risk of not signing it off this week.

French officials have said the leaders of both countries will not leave Friday's European Union summit until a 'powerful' deal is reached.

But a senior German official has given a downbeat assessment of its prospects and said the first step in the deal may not be agreed until at least Christmas.

The official said: 'I have to say today that I am more pessimistic than last week about reaching an overall deal. A lot of protagonists still have not understood how serious the situation is.

'My pessimism stems from the overall picture that I see at this point, in which institutions and member states will have to move on many points to make possible the new treaty rules that we are aiming for.'

The German comment is being seen as apparent effort to jolt partners into accepting Berlin's terms and restrictions.

The news has sent European share prices tumbling. The FTSE 100 closed 0.77 per cent down at 5,526; Germany's DAX ended 0.73 per cent down at 5,985; and France's CAC 40 finished 0.38 per cent down at 3,167.

And it comes hours after a leaked report from European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said a quick-fix solution to the eurozone debt crisis could be achieved without changing the treaties that bind the European Union.

In his interim dossier, prepared for the crucial EU summit that starts tomorrow, he said only minor tweaks were needed to save the euro. His 'fiscal compact' plan would not need to undergo the lengthy process of ratification by parliaments or national referendums.

blitz of eurozone officials

The draft report states that tougher 
fiscal reforms can be adopted simply by amending a protocol, which would
only need national consensus.

Van Rompuy, who will chair the two-day
summit, said this would speed up the implementation of reforms, and 
remove any potential political complications. He
proposed that each eurozone member's budget should be below 3 per cent 
of GDP, national debt under 60 per cent, and a 'golden rule' should be 
enshrined to guarantee balanced budgets in the medium term.

It
also suggested that the eurozone bailout fund should be given a banking
licence to borrow directly from the European Central Banks, and that 
the EC should have the power to impose austerity measures automatically 
on countries which require bailouts.

French
President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European 
Central Bank Chief Mario Draghi and even U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner are all starring in the financial drama leading up to this 
Friday's summit of 27 EU leaders.

If
the summit is a failure, Sarkozy warned last week, 'the world will not 
wait for Europe' and it could spell the end of the 17 country eurozone.

Today, Geithner is in France for talks with Sarkozy
and the prime minister-elect of Spain, Mariano Rajoy Brey. He will also
meet Italian PM Mario Monti in Milan just before the new Italian leader
heads for the EU summit in Brussels.

Later
on, many of Europe's most important leaders will be in Marseille, 
France, for a meeting of the conservative-leaning European People's 
Party.

Merkel, Sarkozy and Spain's new conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, will all be there.

And tomorrow, the European Central Bank holds its monthly policy meeting. Many analysts expect one or more actions by the bank aimed at boosting growth and steadying the financial system.

But Germany has opposed the ECB funding move by saying it would breach a ban on the bank's financing governments.

And the same official said that such a plan to merely amend existing regulations would 'fall short of what we want, which is a clear legal framework to institute a new stability culture'.

Some of Van Rompuy's plans are the 
same as those proposed on Monday by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy. But
Merkozy, as the pair have been dubbed, want to push through more 
radical measures in a bid to introduce a new EU treaty by March.

They want to automatically penalise countries that run up a deficit of more than 3 per cent of its GDP and are urging eurozone leaders to meet every month until the crisis is over.

And they have said that if all 27 EU members cannot agree on a way forward, then they are prepared to work towards a new treaty involving the eurozone bloc and any other country that wants to join.

This could leave Britain, which is not part of the eurozone, feeling more isolated. Van Rompuy also acknowledged that more far-reaching reforms would eventually require a change in EU treaties.

Plans are also being drawn up for a financial 'bazooka' that would see the creation of two separate rescue funds. It would also involve winning increased support for the International Monetary Fund.

This three-pronged rescue system would form part of a carefully crafted package EU leaders hope will win over financial markets and would be introduced alongside plans to re-write EU treaties.

Sources have said negotiators are debating letting the eurozone's existing 440 billion euro bail-out fund to continue working when a new 500 billion euro facility comes into force in mid-2012.

This would almost double the firepower of the financial rescue system. Merkozy's plans have been backed by the U.S. in their plans, with its Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner currently on a three-day blitz of eurozone officials.

Up and down: European markets have fluctuated today with the announcement by the EC President, and then the warning an agreement may not be reached by Friday

He said yesterday that the U.S. Federal Reserve had no plans to give money to the International Monetary Fund to boost the eurozone's bailout fund.

Geithner stressed more action was needed to boost economic growth in Europe, alongside the longer-term reforms. He will meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris today.

His support for the Franco-German blueprint came after credit rating agency Standard & Poor fired two warning shots at the bloc.

Confident: French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said neither Nicolas Sarkozy nor Angela Merkel would leave the negotiating table of the summit until there is a powerful deal

Just hours after the two leaders announced their plan on Monday, S&P put the credit ratings of 15 countries, including Germany and France, on review for a downgrade.

It cited 'continuing disagreements among European policy makers on how to tackle the immediate market confidence crisis'.

And today Geithner told reporters after talking with French Finance Minister Francois Baroin: 'I have a lot of confidence in what the president of France and the minister are doing, working with Germany to build a stronger Europe.'

Baroin added: 'Neither Nicolas Sarkozy nor Angela Merkel will leave the negotiating table of this summit until there is a powerful deal.'

Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of euro zone finance ministers, said he was astonished by S&P's announcement, which he called 'a wild exaggeration and also unfair' because it failed to take account of Italy's new austerity plan.     

It then went a step further yesterday , placing the top-notch rating of the eurozone's 440 billion euro rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), on negative watch since it depends on the creditworthiness of the bloc's six AAA-rated countries.

Spanish Prime Minister-elect Mariano Rajoy - who is due to meet Geithner later on Wednesday at a congress of European conservative leaders in the southern French port of Marseille - said he would support a new treaty.     

But some other EU governments, notably Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, are reluctant to amend the EU charter, either due to eurosceptics at home or because they fear losing possible referendums on ratification.

Figures released on Wednesday showed just how urgently some European banks need help. Italian banks had to borrow 153.2 billion euros in emergency liquidity from the European Central Bank in November, up from 111.3 billion euros at the end of October.

It was another big leap in reliance on the central bank which has almost quadrupled since June, when Italian lenders took 41.3 billion euros. Eurozone banks took more than $50 billion in the ECB's first dollar funding operation since the world's leading central banks agreed last week to cut their cost, five times the $10 billion forecast in a poll of money market traders.

And Germany is set to reactivate a bank rescue fund created at the height of the 2008 financial crisis at next week's cabinet meeting, a government official said.
