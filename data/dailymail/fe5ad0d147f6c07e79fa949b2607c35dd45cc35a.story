The World Cup may historically be one of the biggest sports shows on earth – but this year’s tournament in Brazil is even more far reaching than that.

The six-member crew on the International Space Station may be busy conducting scientific experiments out there on the final frontier. But they will take time out to watch the action in Brazil.

In a video message from orbit, German crew member Alexander Gerst wished all teams and fans in Brazil ‘peaceful games.’

His American colleague Reid Wiseman added: ‘Have fun, play hard, and we'll be watching on the International Space Station.’

Gerst, Wiseman and station commander Steve Swanson of NASA also showed off their football skills in low gravity, displaying some impressive feats in the video that players down on Earth might be envious of.

Along with the German and two Americans, there are three Russians on the space station right now: All their countries are represented at the World Cup.
