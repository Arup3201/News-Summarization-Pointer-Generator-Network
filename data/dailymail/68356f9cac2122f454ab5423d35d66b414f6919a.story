A British poker ace who disappeared from Spain after allegedly stealing more than £2.5 million from investors is living in fear that hitmen are coming to kill him at his bolthole in Berkshire.

Playboy Nigel Goldman, who is being investigated by authorities in Spain and the UK, fled his Costa del Sol mansion in November.

His whereabouts were then exposed when a newspaper tracked him down to a modest house in the picturesque village of Kintbury, where he lives under the alias Howard del Monte.

But the 56-year-old, who counts James Hewitt and Sir Mark Thatcher among his social circle, is now convinced gang bosses want him dead.

Fearing for his life: Nigel Goldman, from Birmingham, who is wanted by Spanish police after vanishing from his luxury Costa del Sol mansion amid a major cash probe

Goldman, who drove a red Ferrari, has been found living in a modest home in the picturesque village of Kintbury, Berkshire under the alias of Howard del Monte

He told The Sunday People: 'There is a bullet out there with my name on it. A guy came to the door a few days ago but I refused to open it.

'He shouted that I was "a dead man" and from an upstairs window I saw him pull a gun out of his pocket.

'It was terrifying. I know he was sent to murder me. I called the police but he drove off ad high speed before they arrived.'

Goldman said he now fears someone will come back to 'finish me off'.

Goldman is being investigated by the Guardia Civil and Action Fraud, the UK's fraud and internet crime reporting centre.

Earlier
 this year the only trace of Goldman since he vanished in Marbella was a
 text message to a former employer three weeks ago which read: 'I did not set out to be a thief.'

Spanish police were probing claims that the broker from Edgbaston in Birmingham, left people empty handed and unable to access their bank funds.

Goldman's lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira

Police were unable to trace him after they received complaints about his
 Tangier-based company, International Financial Investment.

Ex-pat newspaper The Olive Press, based in Spain, tracked Goldman  down using details on his eBay account Bensons Emporium.

He uses the site to buy and sell coins, stamps and antiques.

It was reported his lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his red Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira.

But a neighbour said: 'Everyone in the village knows he's Goldman, whatever name he goes under.'

Geoff Whitton, originally from Cornwall, is trying to locate €20,000 he says he handed to Goldman.The 49-year-old writer said: ‘If he's a legitimate businessman, why hasn't he contacted me?

'I gave €10,000 in May, 2012, and €10,000 two months later. Goldman made me a profit for two months, then a loss for the same amount.

Goldman is said to have moved in the same social circles as cad James Hewitt (left) and Sir Mark Thatcher

'For the next one-and-a-half years, I was in limbo. He'd say, "Just trust me and you will receive a profit in October 2013".'

Goldman, who enjoys swigging champagne and smoking expensive cigars, has a history of dishonesty, in his own book, 'High Stakes: How I Blew £14 million' published in 2006, he confesses being sent to prison twice for fraud.

A review on his book reads: 'Goldman seems to show little remorse - and more than a little contempt - for the victims whose money he lived off so handsomely.'

Despite his past, Goldman is claiming that he, and others, have been duped this time and believes his brokers were running a Ponzi scheme with everyone's money.

From the Costa del Sol to this sleepy Berkshire village Kintbury

A Ponzi 
scheme is an investment operation that pays returns to its investors 
from existing capital or new capital paid by new investors, rather than 
from profit earned by the individual or organisation running the 
operation.

Goldman
 has admitted in writing to owing as much as £658,000 (€800,000). 
However a lawyer acting for investors who claim to have lost cash is 
stating that he is chasing €3 million, a figure rising daily.

Flashy Goldman made his name at some of the world's biggest poker tournaments around the world, winning thousands.

Lawyer
 Antonia Flores, said: 'So far we have spoken to victims in Almeria, 
Malaga and Jaen. In our most recent estimate it looks like reaching €3 
million.

'The first thing he did right was openly admit to all his wrongdoings and say he paid for it and was a new man.

'That
 was a success. People could not talk about his past, people actually 
felt sorry for him. It is large scale, police have not yet issued an 
arrest warrant, but they are not far from doing that.'

Goldman
 offered investments in a host of commodities including bullion, stocks 
and shares although he is not a regulated financial advisor due to his 
criminal convictions.

Roger Parks, a neighbour and friend of Goldman said that he even tried to get him to invest, although he chose not to, he said: 'I have known him for 35 years.

'When he showed me the prospectus for International Financial Investments at his palatial rented home in Elviria a few months ago, I couldn't stopped laughing.

'By the way, has anyone else noted the initials of his company spell IFI, as if "iffy"?'

A spokesman for Action Fraud confirmed complains had been lodged with the organisation about Goldman.

If those complaints are upheld, information gathered will be passed to either the Metropolitan Police or Fraud Investigation Bureau.
