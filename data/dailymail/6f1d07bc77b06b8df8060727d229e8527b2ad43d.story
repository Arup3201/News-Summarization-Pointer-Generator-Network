The 33-year-old striker opted to join the Ligue 1 side rather than rejoin Tottenham, as revealed by Sportsmail on Friday morning.

French fancy: Dimitar Berbatov has swapped relegation-threatened Fulham for Ligue 1 title challengers Monaco

Big-spending Monaco moved
 for Berbatov as they are lacking cover for injured star Radamel 
Falcao, who underwent successful surgery on a knee injury last week.

'I'm happy, excited and a little bit nervous to be honest,' Berbatov told Monaco's official website, www.asm-fc.com.

'I look forward to starting training with my new team-mates and open a new chapter in my career.'

Big changes ahead: Rene Meulensteen is looking to overhaul his squad in a bid to stave off relegation

Berbatov will wear the number 15 at Stade Louis II, where he will stay until the end of the season, when his contract with the Cottagers expires.

Speaking about the addition of Berbatov, Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said: 'Dimitar will bring us all his experience and talent.

'His coming is of course connected to Radamel Falcao's injury. He played in big clubs such as Manchester United and he's a big striker.

'We still have two competitions to play and he will be an asset with Emmanuel Riviere, Valere Germain and Anthony Martial. He has a different profile than our other forwards.'

New boy: Denmark midfielder William Kvist has joined the Cottagers on loan from Bundesliga side Stuttgart

Manager Rene Meulensteen was busy on deadline day in a bid to overhaul his squad and beat the drop.

He moved to replace Berbatov by completing the signing of Greece striker Kostas Mitroglou.

The Cottagers have replaced him with the highly-rated Mitroglou, who has moved to Fulham from Olympiacos for an undisclosed fee.

West Ham were interested in signing Mitroglou, but the 25-year-old has opted to move to Craven Cottage instead.

Mitroglou has signed a four-year contract with the west London club.

The striker began his career in Germany, but moved to Olympiacos in 2007.

He has enjoyed a superb season so far, scoring 14 league goals in the Greek Super League.In total the forward scored 62 goals in 148 appearances for Olympiacos.

All smiles: Morrocan midfielder Adel Taarabt has signed for Italian giants AC Milan

Berbatov joined Fulham in August 2012 and enjoyed a successful first season with the club, scoring 15 goals.

This season has been a different story for the Bulgarian, however.

He
 has found the net just four times in the Barclays Premier League and 
his agent indicated that his client was unhappy at Craven Cottage 
shortly after the sacking of Martin Jol.

Fulham also signed midfielder Lewis Holtby on loan from Tottenham for the rest of the season.

Meanwhile,
 Adel Taarabt signed for AC Milan on loan on Thursday. The Moroccan 
midfielder, 24, will join until the end of the season with a view to 
making his move permanent in the summer.

Taarabt
 said: 'I am honoured to be able to play at the best club in the world. I
 have spoken with Clarence Seedorf and we are both happy. I am an 
attacker and I like to play behind the strikers.

'I do not know Mario Balotelli personally, but I know who he is and I am pleased to be able to play with him.'
