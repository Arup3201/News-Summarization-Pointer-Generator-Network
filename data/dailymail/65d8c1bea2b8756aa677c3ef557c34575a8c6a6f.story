Falling birth rate levels in the U.S. have finally leveled off after plummeting for the past four years, a government report reveals.

The number of babies born last year, just less than 4 million, is only a few hundred less than the number in 2011, the report released on Friday shows.

This suggests fewer couples are scared away from having children because of the economy or other factors, some experts say.

Rates: Following four years of decline, the number of birth rates in the U.S. have begun to level out

One, Brady Hamilton, a statistician with the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, said: 'We may be on level course or 
potentially even see a rise in birth trends in the near future.'

But some remain pessimistic.

Carol Hogue, an Emory University expert on birth trends said: 'The decline has slowed down, but it's still a decline.'

The report also showed that the birth rate for women in their early 30s has also increased for the first time since 2007.

Births were on the rise since the late 1990s and hit an all-time high of more than 4.3 million in 2007.

The drop that followed was widely attributed to the nation's flagging economy.

Experts believed that many women or couples who were out of work or had other money problems felt they couldn't afford to start or add to their family.

The economy was officially in a 
recession from December 2007 until June 2009, but polls showed most 
Americans remained gloomy, citing anemic hiring, a depressed housing 
market and other factors well into 2011.

The new Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention report provides a first look at the 2012 birth certificate 
data from state health departments.

Highlights of the report include:

Experts attribute the decline in teen births to a range of factors, including less sex and more use of contraception.

Bill
Albert of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned 
Pregnancy, said the fact that teen birth rates had been cut in half 
since 1991 was a 'stunning turnaround.'

The report also revealed that about 
33 per cent of births last year were delivered through Cesarean section -
a rate unchanged from the previous two years.

Although
C-sections are sometimes medically necessary, some health officials 
believe many are done out of convenience or unwarranted caution.

In the 1980s, a goal of keeping the national rate at 15 per cent was set.

However, the C-section rate had been rising steadily since 1996, until it dropped slightly in 2010.

Experts say that even if the C-section rate has peaked, it's still too high - particularly in certain states.

For example, last year 40 per cent of births were C-sections in Louisiana, and more than 38 percent in New Jersey, Mississippi and Florida, the report found.

The birth rate for all women of childbearing age, 63 births per 1,000 women, was essentially flat from the year before.

Rates dropped for Hispanic women, down two per cent, and blacks, one per cent, but less than the previous year. The rate continued to stay the same for whites, which rose four per cent, and for Asian-American and Pacific Islanders. Rates fell slightly for American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Rates fell again for women in their early 20s, down three per cent from 2011. This is the lowest for women in that age group since 1940, when comprehensive national birth records were first compiled.

For women in their late 20s, the age
group that accounts for more than a quarter of all of the nation's 
births, birth rates fell one per cent.Â  The rate rose one per cent for women in their early 30s, who have nearly as many babies as women in their late 20s.

Rates
also rose two per cent for mothers aged 35 and older, and one per cent 
for women in their early 40s. Rates in older mothers have been rising 
slightly in recent years, despite the overall downward trend. Experts 
say the trend is because older women generally have better jobs or 
financial security and are more aware of their biological clocks.

Birth
rates for teenage mothers have been falling since 1991 and hit yet 
another historic low. The number of babies born to teens last year, 
about 305,000, is less than half the peak of nearly 645,000 in 1970.
