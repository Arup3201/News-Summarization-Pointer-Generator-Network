Callous Paul Lattimore, 39, was jailed for more than three years for fleecing his dementia-stricken great aunt out of £60,000

A callous thief raided £60,000 from the bank account of his dementia-stricken great aunt after posing as her carer, a court heard. 

Paul Lattimore, 39, splashed out on a new car and a wide screen television after fleecing his frail relative.

His 78-year-old victim was forced to sell her house and move into a care home after her savings were plundered.

The thief was jailed for 40 months after he admitted theft and fraud at the Old Bailey.  

Lattimore became a carer for the vulnerable pensioner, who lived by herself in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, after being released from jail.

He used the frail OAP's bank card to withdraw money from the cashpoint and transferred cash into his own account. 

The thief even paid a deposit for a Volkswagen Golf with her money, and set up a hire purchase agreement for the vehicle against her current account for the £199 monthly repayments.

The car was registered in his great aunt's name and he then ran up 40 fines for speeding and driving in bus lanes.  

Lattimore also signed up to a finance agreement in his great aunt's name for a widescreen TV.

He carried out the thefts between April last year and January.

Lattimore, also of Wisbech, was snared when his victim told police she thought her money was being taken by her great nephew.

He was arrested and refused to answer questions. Lattimore later admitted the theft and fraud at the Old Bailey in London.

He was jailed for 40 months and the goods he had fraudulently acquired were forfeited.

Detective Constable Ralph King, of Cambridgeshire Police, was also commended by the judge for his work on the case.

Det Con King said: "Lattimore callously took advantage of his vulnerable relative, who does not live near other members of her family.

"The victim was forced to sell her home to help towards her losses and is now settled in a care home.

"These were appalling offences and I hope the jail sentence reassures the victim and her family that justice has been done."
