More than £16,000 has been spent by British diplomats this year on cigars, it has been reported.

Claims that £16,137 spent on cigars in 2014 is said to be part of £407,797 spent by the Foreign Office on entertaining.

The figures are thought to have come to light as part of a review by the Labour party, which is closely monitoring Government spending.

According to the Sun, diplomats have also spent nearly £3,000 on flowers this year, and £257,000 on restaurant bills from embassies worldwide.

In addition they also report that more than £45,000 has been spent on alcohol and more than £18,000 on fast food.

It also emerged that over £1,000 was spent at O'Reilly's bar in Fiji and £1,400 went on a dinner at the East India Club in central London.

Other cash is said to have gone to music stores, bakeries, confectionery stores and art galleries.

Last year, it was reported that British embassies and consulates around the world blew £8.8million on hospitality, allowing ambassadors to enjoy fine wines, good food and lavish parties at taxpayers' expense.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said they were looking into where the money was spent.

He added: 'This was spending in an all-purpose diplomatic department store. We are looking into specific spending lines, but we are confident that none or very little of this spending was on cigars.

'The store description does not refer to the goods actually bought – it’s simply how the store describes itself to the card billing company.

'All our spending is rigorously scrutinised to ensure it is appropriate and provides value for money for the taxpayer, with GPC cards offering better value-for-money than other forms of payment. Overall spend on goods and services is going down.'
