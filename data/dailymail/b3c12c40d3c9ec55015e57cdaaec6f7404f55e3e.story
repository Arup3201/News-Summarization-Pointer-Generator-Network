A mind-bending maths formula that left baffled residents scratching their heads after it mysteriously appeared on building site hoardings has been exposed as gibberish.

Speculation was rife after a 20ft wall in Boscombe, Dorset, was scrawled with the mathematical chalk graffiti.

The appearance of the enormous equation sparked a debate over whether it was the work of a maths genius or an artistic imposter.

Puzzling: This young boy was left scratching his head when he had a go at this maths equation scrawled on a wall in Dorset which has been deemed 'meaningless'

But maths experts have blown the theory out of the water, describing the formula as 'meaningless'.

Boscombe resident Jonathan Crozier, who first spotted the giant equation, claimed it to be the work of a maths graduate.

Local councillor Chris Wakefield even issued a call to his residents to come forward and solve the puzzle.

Mr Wakefield said: 'It’s an interesting equation, but I’m not a chemist or a mathematician.

'If someone would like to come forward and tell us what it means then I would be intrigued.'

The formula even had Bournemouth maths graduate Holly Crosby in a spin.

She said: 'This is clearly a very advanced equation and I would like to have a go at cracking it.'

But any hopes of unlocking the formula have been rubbished by experts, who described the scribbles as 'interesting but meaningless'.

Sebastian Rees, from Manchester University’s maths department, said: 'The formula looks interesting but appears meaningless.

'There are small sections that may well have been taken from A-Level text books and would make sense in isolation, but otherwise there is no greater meaning.'
