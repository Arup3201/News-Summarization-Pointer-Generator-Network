Parents at a Massachusetts elementary school were left fuming after teachers removed the word 'God' from the Lee Greenwood song 'God Bless the U.S.A.' - then pulled it from a school concert when they complained.

Children at Stall Brook Elementary School in Bellingham were reportedly told to sing 'We love the U.S.A.' instead of 'God Bless the U.S.A.' - the original title of the popular country song.

When parents expressed surprise and anger at the decision, school officials decided to remove the song from a school assembly concert. 

Under fire: Stall Brook Elementary School has angered parents by removing the word 'God' from the Lee Greenwood song 'God Bless the U.S.A.'

The school's principal told news channel Fox 25 they hoped to 'maintain the focus on the original objective of sharing students’ knowledge of the U.S. States, and because of logistics, will not include any songs'.

Singer Lee Greenwood, who first released 'God Bless the U.S.A.' in 1984, issued a statement to Fox News condemning the school's behaviour.

He said: 'The most important word in the whole piece of music is the word God, which is also in the title "God Bless The USA".

'Maybe the school should have asked the parents their thoughts before changing the lyrics to the song. They could have even asked the writer of the song, which I of course, would have said you can’t change the lyrics at all or any part of the song.'

Angry: Country singer Lee Greenwood, who wrote the song, says he would not have given permission for the word change

The country star added that the phrase 'God Bless the USA' has a 'very important meaning for those in the military and their families, as well as new citizens coming into our country.'

He pointed out that the song is played at naturalisation ceremonies for new American citizens, after the National Anthem. 

'If the song is good enough to be played and performed in its original setting under those circumstances, it surely should be good enough for our children,' Mr Greenwood said.

An online poll taken by right-wing TV station Fox suggested that over 80 per cent of its viewers were outraged by the decision to remove God from the song.

Facebook users also rallied in defence of the patriotic song's traditional lyrics, with one writing: 'Here we go again, more war on Christianity. You can remove God all you want, but the good news — there is still a loving God and He lives.'

Another agreed, saying, 'I’d like to say unbelievable — but it is so totally believable.'

However, some parents saw the change as a non-issue.

Matthew Cote, who has a child at Brook Elementary School, said: 'I don’t think there’s anything wrong with changing the song.

'It’s a public school. If you want to have the word God in the song, go to a private school.'
