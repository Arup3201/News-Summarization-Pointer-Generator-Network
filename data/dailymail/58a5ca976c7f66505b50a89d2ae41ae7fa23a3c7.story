Former Scottish Premier League footballer Sean Murdoch surprised his girlfriend Charissa Ferguson by enlisting the help of New York's Broadway Dance Centre to help him with his marriage proposal.

Murdoch, who is currently training with New York City FC, popped the big question in New York's Times Square after joining in with the dancing group's flash mob routine.

The six dancers jigged around to Bruno Mars' Marry You song before Murdoch joined in to the surprise of Ferguson.

His new fiancee looked incredibly emotional before Murdoch got down on one knee and pulled out a ring.

Ferguson accepted his proposal before shedding a tear. Murdoch told The Daily Record: 'I’m delighted. 

'I was just trying to think outside the box and had some ideas, so I reached out to Broadway Dance Centre and they came up with the dance.

'I had a good idea she’d say yes but I was nervous. Once I started dancing I totally loved it.'
