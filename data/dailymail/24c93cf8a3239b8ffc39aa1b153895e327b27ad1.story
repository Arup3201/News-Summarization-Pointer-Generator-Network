The disgruntled wife of a motorbike fanatic has posted a sarcastic advert on eBay selling the 'selfish git's' pride and joy Triumph Rocket III Roadster.

Alison Raynor, 48, whose rant has attracted bids of up to £10,000 and even marriage proposals, says she hopes to get her lounge in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire 'pimped with the proceeds'.

Despite the angry tone of the advert, there is some doubt over the authenticity of the argument after the couple - who plan on staying together - admitted the listing was 'only a bit of fun'.

Despite the angry tone of the advert, there is some doubt over the authenticity of the argument after Mr and Mrs Raynor - who plan on staying together - admitted the listing was 'only a bit of fun'

Mother of two Alison Raynor, who has been married to Tony for 16 years, says she has been bombarded with marriage proposals from around the world after posting the advertisement

The advert for the Triumph motorcycle, which 'selfish spendaholic' Tony Raynor reportedly considers his 'other woman', reads: 'My husband’s 300 brake horsepower monster cruiser is up for sale.'

'The selfish git has spent several kitchens turning this into an overpowered drag sofa, but I’m finally getting the lounge pimped with the proceeds... The paint job alone cost the price of a holiday on the Riviera,' Mrs Raynor adds.

'Hopefully it will sell to some area far from here so that we can eventually get the tarmac on our local roads repaired,' she went on.

'This supercharged and intercooled Rocket III Roadster comes with a free set of ear plugs in case you want to retain your hearing...I would advise married men not to bother with these so as to quell the screams of their soon-to-be ex-wives,' Mrs Raynor said.

Her parting shot to would-be buyers was: 'Message me and I will reply with the imbecile’s phone number so that you can speak your endless drivel together.'

Mother of two sons Mrs Raynor, who has been married to Tony for 16 years, says she has been bombarded with marriage proposals from around the world after posting the advertisement.

'Some people have told me I'm their perfect woman and asked to marry me and I've had others which say he should 'ditch the b***h',' she said.

'I think some men think I'm this tyrant,
 which I'm not. Others seem to think it's hilarious and have said if it 
doesn't work out with Tony, I can marry them,' she added.

'I see it as a bit of fun and the bike has always been a running joke between me and Tony. I hate the thing and I refer to it as the 'other woman',' Mrs Raynor went on.

Mr Raynor said this was not the first bike he had invested heavily in before being forced to sell.

He says he bought the Triumph Rocket III Roadster, which he 'eats, sleeps and breaths', for £12,000 four years ago, and has since spent another £12,000 customising the machine - including £4,500 on new handlebars.

'She has always given me stick about my bikes. She would rather have another pair of shoes,' Mr Raynor said.

'The way it works is I get a new bike and she gets a new kitchen,' he added.

One comment said: 'Quite an amusing ad... Let’s be honest now, wives don’t usually know the first thing about the bloke’s bike, let alone where he got the paint done.'

Mrs Raynor replied: 'I know where the pathetic imbecile got everything done because he schlepped me around the country buying the useless nonsense.'

Another comment read: 'Best written advert I have seen on eBay. Made me laugh so much I woke my wife up! Hope you get what you want for it.'

A third reader posted: 'I just wanted to say thank you for creating and posting such an awesome listing. It made my day. Good luck selling the bike and pimping your kitchen.'

Despite the pending sale of the bike, Mrs Raynor says she doubts her husband's riding days are behind him.

'I'm not going to kid myself that this will be the last bike he owns, but
at least for now it looks like we're rid of it,' she said.
