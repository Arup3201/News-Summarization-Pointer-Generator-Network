Bag carrier: David Mellor leaves a radio station with an unknown woman on Saturday

If David Mellor was hoping to blend in with the crowd, this bag was not the way to do it.

Covered in gaudy pink swirls, it stuck out like a sore thumb as he walked through Leicester Square in central London on his way home from presenting his LBC radio show.

But as he strolled out with a woman who left the offices with him, he looked perfectly at ease – and between them, they even managed to get a taxi, despite Mr Mellor’s recent rant at a driver.

The former Tory minister, 65, was caught on tape last month calling a cabbie a ‘sweaty, stupid little git’ when he became furious at the route taken by the driver after a visit to Buckingham Palace, where Mr Mellor’s partner Lady Cobham had received a CBE.

Mr Mellor yelled: ‘I’ve been in the Cabinet, I’m an award-winning broadcaster, I’m a Queen’s Counsel’, before demanding: ‘Who are you to question me?’

Cabbies vowed to refuse to pick up Mr Mellor as a result. 

But on Saturday, when these pictures were taken, his unusual bag – and not his language – was the most colourful thing on display.

An onlooker said: ‘He came out of the radio station with the woman and they walked through the square. She raised her arm to hail the taxi.

‘As soon as it stopped, they both stepped out on the street and Mr Mellor opened the door for her, said something to the driver then got in himself. There didn’t seem to be any problem.’

It was unclear if Mr Mellor was, in an act of chivalry, carrying the eye-catching bag for the unknown woman, who herself was carrying a large black and white bag, or if it was his own.
