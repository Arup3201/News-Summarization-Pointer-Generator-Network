Killer: Frank Garcia shot his wife and a police officer

A man who shot dead his wife and killed a police officer who investigated their row was executed last night by lethal injection

Frank Garcia, 39, gunned down Jessica Garcia in 2001 on the day she tried to leave him, shooting her six times.

He killed 49-year-old Texas police officer Hector Garza, with three bullets when he arrived at their home to check out the disturbance.

Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed, who prosecuted the case, attended the execution in Huntsville, Texas.

She said: 'If there was ever a poster child for the
death penalty, this is the case.'

She described the murderrs as a 'huge tragedy.'

The
execution had been scheduled for 6 p.m., but Garcia was not strapped to
the gurney until 6:42 p.m. because his last-minute appeal failed atÂ  
the U.S. Supreme Court.

Singing to God and even asking Jesus to torment Reed so 'she, too, finds the Lord,' Garcia was unrepentant.

Victims: Garcia's wife Jessica was shot six times and San Antonio police officer Hector Garza, a father-of-five, was gunned down when he called at their home

In his last rambling statement he did not 
apologise or even mention the fatal shootings of his wife or father-of-five Garza.

'Thank you, Yahweh, thank you, Jesus Christ, hallelujah, amen, and thank you, warden,' were his final words.

After his arrest, Garcia told police he aimed for 
Garza's head because he knew officers wear bullet-proof vests.

The Garcias' five-year-old daughter witnessed both murders, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. He also shot and wounded his wife's uncle during the incident.

Several dozen of Garza's San Antonio police colleagues were present outside the prison unit during the execution.

The San Antonio Police Department said in a statement: 'Though the execution does not bring complete closure to Hector's family, as we all miss him dearly, it comforts us to know that Frank Garcia will never destroy another family.'

Garcia's execution was the 12th this year in Texas, which has executed more than four times as many people as any other state since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

As of Wednesday there had been 38 executions this year in the United States, according to the Center.

Texas last month abolished the long-held tradition of allowing condemned inmates to order what they want for their last meal. Instead, they receive what other prisoners are served.
