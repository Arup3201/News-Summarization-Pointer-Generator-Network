Moving hospital beds further apart and having fewer patients on wards will prevent the spread of a new breed of superbugs, say experts.

There should also be large windows for better air circulation as part of a ‘Victorian-style makeover’ to help cut the risk of infection.

Scientists said such measures would buy medics crucial time as they attempt to develop new cures for antibiotic-resistant superbugs.

Last month the World Health Organisation warned that the threat was so high patients may soon die from scratches or grazes that become infected.

Professor Kevin Kerr, from Hull York Medical School, told the Royal Society: 'We are talking about returning hospital wards to the type we had 100 years ago.

‘In the near future it is possible that a scratch from a rose thorn could become septic.

‘Without effective antibiotics, septicaemia could easily set in and result in death.’

Addressing a meeting of the Royal Society in London last week, which was attended by Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, he added: ‘It is a terrible prospect, but a very real one.

‘We are facing a return to the state of affairs that existed before antibiotics were discovered.’

The problem has been caused by the widespread use of antibiotics by doctors – and farmers on livestock -  which has led to bacteria evolving so they are immune.

At the same time, drug companies have 
developed fewer, new antiobiotics as they are not as profitable as more 
expensive treatments for diabetes and high blood pressure, for example.

Professor Mark Kerr, from Kingston University, London, called on hospitals to employ ‘old school’ measures, adding: ‘We need to hold back the spread of resistant bacteria while finding ways to persuade pharmaceuticals to improve their output of new generations of antibiotics.’

Although rates of MRSA and C.difficile in hospitals are at record lows, scientists are deeply concerned about a new breed of antibiotic-resistant superbugs that includes strains of E. Coli.

Last month Dr Keiji Fekuda, assistant director for health security at the World Health Organisation said: ‘The world is headed for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill.

‘We should anticipate to see many more deaths.’

‘We are going to see people who have untreatable infections, we cant do anything about them. Or there will be people who will be treatable but it will take much longer to treat them.’
