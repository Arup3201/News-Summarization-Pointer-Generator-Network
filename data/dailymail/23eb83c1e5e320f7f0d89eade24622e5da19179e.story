A leading propagandist in Argentina’s long-running campaign to claim the Falklands has been denounced as a traitor – not just to the Falkland Islands, where he was born, but to his daughters and heavily pregnant former wife.

Alejandro Betts, who advises the Argentine government, has written books denouncing British rule of the ‘Malvinas’, including a recently published work presented to Pope Francis, an Argentinian by birth, a few weeks ago.

But the family he abandoned when he left the Falklands has spoken out, claiming the real reason he left was not to follow political principle but to pursue an Argentinian mistress Santina Toranzo, in June 1982.

His British daughter, Magaly Betts, said: ‘We were brought up with the knowledge that my father had cheated on my mother and left her when she was heavily pregnant for an Argentine woman just before the Falklands War.

‘The reason my father left the Falklands was never political. He actually made a choice to abandon my pregnant mother for this woman and everyone on the islands knows about this.

‘Since he has left the islands for Argentina he has not acknowledged our existence and has chosen not to participate in our lives. I would not want anything to do with him.’

Now a senior Argentine civil servant, Betts remarried in Argentina and in 2007 unsuccessfully stood for mayor of Cordoba, which is the country’s second largest city. 

He is also a government adviser on the Falklands.

He has been dubbed ‘the Falklands Lord Haw-Haw’ – after the notorious William Joyce, who broadcast Nazi propaganda to the UK during the Second World War and was hanged for treason in 1946.

Late last year, the Argentine embassy in London issued a book called Malvinas Matters in which Betts wrote a chapter about how he discovered the ‘truth’. 

He outlines Argentina’s historical claims, which centre on Spain’s control of the islands during the 18th Century, and his conviction that islanders were blocked from the truth by the British.

Betts, a fourth generation Falklander, who changed his name from Alexander to Alejandro, has previously said: ‘I stood up for what I thought was best for the Malvinas, for the Falklands, and that is where my heart still lies.’

Yet for the family he abandoned, the book is another callous insult. 

Betts was born in 1947 and in 1978 he married his second wife Rosa, who was working in Government House in Port Stanley.

In January 1981, Rosa, a Chilean, gave birth to Magaly and soon after became pregnant again. 

Now living in North Wales, Rosa, 62, remembers the day that Alex abruptly ended their relationship with a phone call when she was visiting her family in the Chilean port of Punta Arenas.

She said: ‘Just a few days before Christmas Alex phoned me and said: “I have got someone else. We have fallen in love. I want you to stay with your mother in Chile.”

‘I said: “Thank you, so you are washing your hands of us? No, thank you. We will sort this out when we are back in the Falklands.’

‘Alex had come out to collect me and the children. But on the plane back he told me that when we arrived in the Falklands he would leave me. 

'That’s exactly what he did. When we landed in Port Stanley he went off.’ 

In 1987 Rosa, Magaly and Zoe would move to the UK. 

Rosa said: ‘I was ill, I wanted a better future for my children and when Magaly was only three she was being taught how to recognise a bomb. I did not want them growing up with this.

‘But the main reason was that after the war Dawn used to go to school in the Falklands, and if her father spoke out publicly in Argentina, they would say, “Poor Dawn, your father is a traitor”.

‘What he did was not my fault, was not my children’s fault. I did not want Dawn to continue to suffer this and I did not want Magaly or Zoe growing up with this.

‘He does not mention in his book that we were married and had two children together. He never mentions to the Argentine people that he left a heavily pregnant woman.

He was never pro-Argentine when we were married. On the contrary he was pro-British. He followed whatever the Argentine government told him to do. That’s it.’

Betts meanwhile is resigned to the fact that he can never go back to the Falklands. Of the family he left behind he will say only: ‘Anything Rosa might have to say doesn’t interest me. 

'I am sure she tells a very neat version that fits into her life and way of thinking. I don’t think it is anything worth troubling about.’
