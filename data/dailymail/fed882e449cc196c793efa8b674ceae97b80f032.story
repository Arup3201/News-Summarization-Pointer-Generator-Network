Esther Rantzen, who is set to be made a Dame in the New Year's Honours List for her charity and campaigning work 

She’s the legendary star of That’s Life! who went on to found ChildLine for abused children and The Silver Line charity for lonely pensioners.

And now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Esther Rantzen is to achieve the ultimate recognition for her tireless campaigning – by being made a Dame in the New Year Honours.

Among the other honours is a knighthood for veteran actor John Hurt, 74, marking a glittering stage and film career that has spanned more than 50 years.

ChildLine was established after Ms Rantzen, 74, highlighted the problems of child abuse in 1986 on her BBC show That’s Life! The programme was swamped with calls from the public who said they had been treated cruelly as children.

It led to the creation of the charity which was deluged with 50,000 calls on its first day. The charity, of which Ms Rantzen is president, is now merged with the NSPCC and has 11 bases in the UK. The idea has been copied in 150 countries.

Her work led to her being raised to Commander of the British Empire (CBE) for services to children in 2006. She had already been awarded the OBE in 1991.

In 2012, Ms Rantzen spoke of her regret at not paying more attention to rumours about the paedophile crimes of DJ Jimmy Savile.

She admitted: ‘We all blocked our ears to the gossip. I felt to blame. I felt Jim had persuaded us all, audiences, fans, television professionals, even the Pope, to create a myth around Saintly Jim so that he became untouchable. He deceived all of us.’

Two years ago, Ms Rantzen set up The Silver Line, a ‘ChildLine for older people’, after describing her own loneliness following the death of her husband, film-maker Desmond Wilcox. 

For the first time she found herself living on her own and was not prepared for how hard it would be. 

Two Pints of Lager actress: Sheridan Smith, star of ITV series Cilla, will reportedly receive an OBE

Actor John Hurt, who has had a career spanning more than 50 years, is also set to receive a knighthood 

She wrote of her dread of coming back to an empty flat, of spending evenings alone on the sofa and waking at midnight, still on the sofa, with the TV blaring and ‘my head heavy and aching, and having to force myself to my empty bed’. 

Also said to be among those set for an honour is Sheridan Smith, star of ITV series Cilla - and Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps. The Sun On Sunday reports she will receive an OBE. 

The knighthood for John Hurt is in recognition of his work in more than 150 films. 

Hurt – also known for his hellraising antics in the 1970s as a drinking pal of fellow actors Peter O’Toole, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris – has played a wide range of roles from Harry Potter’s wandmaker Mr Ollivander to gay civil servant Quentin Crisp in The Naked Civil Servant, and John Merrick in The Elephant Man, which involved spending up to 12 hours a day in the make-up department.

Joan Collins, left, is also set to be made a Dame, while James Corden, right, is set to receive an OBE 

He has won two Oscars, a Golden Globe and four Baftas, but often downplays his talent, saying he is ‘just a character actor really’.

Comic actor James Corden, 36, who played Smithy in Gavin & Stacey, is to receive an OBE. The honour is in recognition of his services to entertainment and charity.

And Joan Collins, 81, who played Alexis Carrington in 1980s soap Dynasty, is expected to become a Dame. She made her stage debut aged nine and went to Hollywood in her 20s, later starring in raunchy movies based on her sister Jackie’s novels The Stud and The Bitch.

Five-times-married Collins, 81, is now settled with theatre producer Percy Gibson, 49. Asked about their age gap, she once joked: ‘If he dies, he dies!’
