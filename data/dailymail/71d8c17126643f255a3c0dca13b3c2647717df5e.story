The ex-stripper wife of jailed money manager to Hollywood stars is making her own bid for stardom.

Dianne Passage has been picked to appear in a new reality show called 'Wall Street Wives'.

Her husband Kenneth Starr was jailed for seven years in 2010 for siphoning off more than $30million from his celebrity clients, including actress Uma Thurman and director Marin Scorsese, in an elaborate Ponzi scheme.

Passage, who met her husband while 
working as a stripper at New York's Scores club, has been forced to give
up her luxury lifestyle since her husband's downfall.

The 35 year is divorcing her husband of three years and said the reality show would be 'fun.'

She said Starr, 66, did not have a say
in her appearing on the show which is being touted as a rival to the 
Real Housewives series.

Devon Fleming, the show's creator, 
said Passage still qualified as a Wall Street wife as she was not yet 
divorced from her fraudster husband.

'She’s got a lot of stuff,' said Fleming.

'She still visits her husband in jail a lot, and she couldn’t be nicer.'

Passage, who went by the stage name 
of Chase, was named as a co-defendant in court papers filed against her 
husband but was never prosecuted.

The money manager dumped his third wife after meeting Passage during a night out at the strip club in 2007.

She was paid $150,000 a year by Starr
after he made her vice-president of a record company and was accused of
spending thousands of pounds stolen from accounts managed by her 
husband.

Wall Street Wives is being shopped to TV networks but Fleming has not revealed the names of any other women taking part.
