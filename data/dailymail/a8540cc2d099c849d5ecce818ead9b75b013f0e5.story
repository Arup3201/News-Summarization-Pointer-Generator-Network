Memories can be a dark reminder of a life spent fighting for freedom, but they can also tell a story of survival, perseverance and resilience.

Sylvia McNeall was only a child when she lived through some of the 20th century's most historic and horrific times.

The Russian revolution in Moscow, World War II, the angst of her family being forced to move from place to place to escape concentration camps, living as a refugee and migrating to Australia.

The Sydney author has told her story of three generations of the Zinoffsky and Parret family, her book 'Foresight and Perseverance' a compelling memoir of historical importance.

But while a past of battle and struggle haunts so many, Sylvia has concentrated her extraordinary life of survival on the good times, praising her beloved father who kept her family going.

'My father kept his humanity through all difficulties, he was in Berlin with all the bombing and sent us to an area, a lovely town, to escape the bombing, a Red Cross town,' said Sylvia.

'I understood (about the hard times etc.) we had family stories from grandparents, other members of the family, I was very aware of what was happening.' 

Her book, primarily told through the eyes of a young girl, provides an insight into Sylvia's Estonian family and their struggle to fight for a better life.

'We lived in Berlin World war 2, father had a job as an architect.'

'The bombing became horrific, he had to stay for his job, accommodation bombed out twice, lost a lot of things, family photographs but he survived.

'It was scary but I only had memories of good times, times were exciting when both Russians and Americans used to try and stop the huge exodus from the east to west.'

'Occasionally we were caught but we would escape and go again, it was a traumatic time but my father drew attention to the beautiful things.'

Sylvia told of how she was mostly affected as a child by becoming a refugee. 

'625 kilometres mostly walking for several months during summer from Karlsvad to Heidleberg, we lived there for four years, it was a deprived time in Germany.' 

She also tells the fascinating tale of immigrating to Australia in 1949 in search of a safer place to raise a family and a better life. 

'It was very well known about, Australia, father was always interested in topical events and he really researched.'

The family had an option of migrating to America, Canada or Australia but the plentiful land down under seemed the more attractive option.

'America had no support, he wasn't interested in Canada, father liked Australia,' she said.

'He realised you had to sign a two year contract to work, you had accommodation in a migrant hostel which was free until you were working.'

But the trip to begin their new life in Australia was a long and arduous affair, it took three weeks by ship in conditions that were not so favourable.

'We moved such a lot it was a normal thing for me.'

'The ship voyage was pretty awful, men slept downstairs next to the engines, it was very hot and I got pretty sea sick but the food wasn't too bad.'

Sylvia described her families start in Australia, although exciting, as pretty mundune.

'The food was ordinary, the hostel was primitive but my sister and I had learnt English in Germany so I went to school, I fit in ok, there was also another Latvian girl there.'

'My grandmother came with us, she was 68, but she got a job in the clothing industry because she didn't like the hostels.'

Her love and her families love for Australia soon grew, Sylvia thankful her father made that decision to migrant to a land so far away.

'It brang a lot of opportunities, a new life for us, Germany held no future, well in 49' things were so deprived,' she said.

'Australia offered a future and I was very happy to come.'

Out of the hostels Sylvia's family then moved to Kings Cross where they got a flat, which started the beginning of their integration into Australian society.

'Started going to Double Bay primary school, Randwick high.'

'Father learnt english and got a better job but our upbringing continued to be Estonian, celebrating in our heritage.'

'When I finished high school I got a scholarship to Sydney college, the national arts school, did five years. My friends were mostly people from Australia.'

Sylvia said she had two motivators to writing the book, she was interested in finding out all she could on her family history, while she also wanted to expose what communism did in Estonia.

'You don't hear much about Estonia, Lithuania, Poland as a result of communism.'

'The most intriguing simularity to what happened in Estonia is what is happening in Ukraine now,' said Sylvia.

The family tree

'The negotiations in Ukraine are so similar, Putin is not interested in world peace.' 

Sylvia says her parents are very grateful for Australia's help in a place they now all call home.

'There was always a future.'
