Robbie Lawler upset champion Johny Hendricks in Las Vegas on Saturday night to win the welterweight title at UFC 181.

Almost nine months after their first meeting, Lawler was given the nod via a split decision after another absorbing clash.

For Lawler it was the culmination of a 12-year journey with the organisation.

Hendricks slowed down in the last two rounds, allowing Lawler to take control of the contest

‘This has been an amazing journey,’ he said. ‘There have been a lot of guys behind me. This wasn't easy.

‘I thought I needed to get in his face and force him to fight. That's what my corner told me to do. That's how we fight in UFC. It's how you fight championship fights.’

Lawler had the better of the opening round, using his knees to good effect but was taken down in the second session.

The challenger struggled to maintain the pace he had set from the first claxon with Hendricks looking stronger in round three.

But he seemed to tire, forcing referee Herb Dean to restart the action several times.

Lawler continued to press, landing a succession of blows to the body in the penultimate stanza.

And it was he who finished the fight in the ascendancy, doing enough to earn the decision.

Hendricks simply left the Octagon without comment.

In the co-main event, Anthony Pettis defended his lightweight title after submitting No 1 contender Gilbert Melendez in the second round.

It is the first time Melendez, a former Strikeforce champion, has been stopped.

'I just showed the message right there,' Pettis said. 'The No 1 guy in the world [and I finished him in] two rounds.

'I give big ups to Gilbert. I've been watching him a long time. When I was a kid, I was watching him. But now I'm here.'

Melendez enjoyed his successes in the first round, landing several blows and taking Pettis down.

'He was fast, striking tight in the pocket,' Melendez said. 'I was trying to load up on that punch and he popped in that jab.

'I wanted to stay in his face and bang it out, and try to test his chin as much as possible. 'He's good and quick.'
