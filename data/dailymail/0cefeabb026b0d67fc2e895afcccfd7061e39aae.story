Ryan Giggs called for Adnan Januzaj to be given more protection on Tuesday night after the Manchester United youngster was injured in an incident with Hull midfielder David Meyler.

Meyler will be waiting anxiously to see if the FA take any action after he appeared to deliberately stand on Januzaj's outstretched leg towards the end of the game.

If referee Craig Pawson confirms on Wednesday that he did not spot it, then the FA will be free to act and Meyler's place in the FA Cup final against Arsenal a week on Saturday could be in jeopardy.

Stamp it out: Meyler got away with the stamp on Januzaj late in the second half

It is the second time this season that Januzaj has been the alleged victim of a stamp after Fulham's Sascha Riether was banned for three matches in November after accepting a FA charge of violent conduct.

Hull boss Steve Bruce insisted that he did not see last night's incident, but Giggs described it as 'a joke'. He added: 'I didn't see it but I've seen his leg. It's the second time it has happened to him this season. It's not great to see, and it's terrible his leg.

'He needs protecting. He's a brilliant, exciting player and the authorities need to sort it out. It's just the length of his leg, not cutting into his skin. It goes form his knee to his ankle.'

Giggs came on as a substitute for his 963rd - and possibly final - appearance at Old Trafford in his last home game as interim boss, and admitted that he is still in two minds whether to play on next season.

Thin line: Meyler was already on a yellow card for an earlier foul on Tom Lawrence

He used the occasion to give supporters 
'a glimpse into the future', giving senior debuts to James Wilson and 
Tom Lawrence alongside Januzaj.

Wilson, 18, scored two of United's goals and admitted that he only knew he would be in the team on the morning of the match.

'It
 came as a shock but he had faith in me,' he said. 'I got out there and 
tried to show what I could do. My family were out in full force tonight 
and it was a great feeling.

'When the first went in it was total 
euphoria. The second one was a great experience. It was about getting 
used to the physicality and the pace of the game. I played here for the 
Under-21s but it is different with 75,000 people.'
