The son of one of America's most notorious mobsters has penned a tell-all book detailing his father's sordid dealings what it was like to grow up Gotti.

In his autobiography Shadow of My Father, John Gotti's namesake son, John A 'Junior' Gotti, writes of his visits to his father in prison, reveals how the Dapper Don used so-called dental furloughs to relax outside of prison and describes how mobsters 'get made.'

Gotti said he decided to write the memoir in spite of his mother's protests because he heard notorious mob rat John Alite was penning his own tall-all about the Gambino crime family.

Telling his story: Dapper Don John Gotti's namesake son has written a tell all memoir about his life in the infamous Gambino crime family

Shadow of My Father details the sordid life of an infamous crime boss and what it was like to live in his famous shadow

'Our privacy has been invaded more than most families’ due to the selfishness of my father and I,' Gotti told the New York Daily News. 

'But I can’t keep sitting back and letting this happen.'

In sensational 2009 court testimony, Gambino member John Alite linked his former best friend Gotti Jr. to a series of gangland slayings, boasted that he slept with reality television graduate Victoria Gotti and claimed two police officers were in on the mob hit.

Gotti Jr. was charged with racketeering, but never convicted.

New York's Gambino family has been the subject of a steady stream of government indictments and prosecutions since the Dapper Don was sentenced to life in prison in 1992. He died behind bars in 2002.

Gotti Jr.'s own recent prison stint ended in Demember 2009. He claims to have left the crime world behind in 1999, but recalls with great detail what the life afforded his father--like breaks from prison to visit his family and relax in freedom.

On a so-called 'dental furlough,' Gotti says his father was escorted by armed guards from Green Haven correctional facility to a Manhattan dental office.

'My father would go up to the dentist’s office, open his mouth, and then go out the back of the building where one of the fellows would drive him away,' Gotti writes.

The guards, paid off with hundreds of dollars, would wait patiently as Gotti went home, changed out of his prison jumpsuit and spent quality time with Gotti Jr. and the rest of the family.

'When it was time to return to the prison, my father’s man would drive him back to the dentist’s building, and he would emerge from the front entrance back into the custody of the marshals,' Gotti writes.

Gotti recalls a time when, at just four years old, he visited his father in jail where he told him he wanted to be a police officer for Halloween.

Gotti recalls his father saying:

'If I ever hear you let my son or any of my kids, or you for that matter, talk to that cop, or any other cop, I’ll kill you.'

Despite growing up with a father in and out of prison and seeing other dark sides of crime life, Gotti Jr. would go on to follow in his dad's footsteps and join the notorious Gambinos.

In his book, he describes how he first entered into the organization, a process called getting 'made.'

John Gotti was one of the most notorious modern day mob bosses. His son, who followed in his father's footsteps until leaving the crime life in 1999, wrote a tell-all out Monday in order to protect the family name as Gambino turncoat John Alite pens his own memoirs

Gotti Jr recalls in his book going to visit his father in prison in the 1970s. He also describes his father's so-called 'dental furloughs' in which the infamous mobster paid off armed guards in order to spend a day with his family outside prison

'There were roughly a dozen men sitting around a table…open seats for the new inductees,' he writes. 'A pin pricked my “trigger” finger. A drop of blood was put on a picture of a saint, which was then burned in my hand. I moved the flaming picture from hand to hand, until it was totally consumed by the fire.'

Gotti Jr. has been tried four times since 2005 for racketeering. Each trial ended in a hung jury. He said he left organized crime in 1999.

The self-published ebook, out Monday, was not Gotti's first attempt at a memoir. He told the Daily News that he had over 300 pages of a previous iteration of the tome but destroyed it all to satisfy his worried mother.

Like father like son? Like his father (left), Gotti Jr. was a member of the infamous Gambino crime family and has had repeated run-ins with the law. Now, however, the 50-year-old says he's retired from the lawless life

Gotti Sr. gained a reputation as the 'Teflon Don' after his repeated acquittals and his namesake son had similar good fortune until he was put away following a plea deal. He was released in 2009. His father died in prison in 2002 

Gotti Jr and his attorney leave after jurors declared a mistrial during the 3rd day of jury deliberations on Gotti's 2nd retrial on racketeering and kidnapping charges. Gotti Jr. was the Gambino family's acting boss from 1992 to 1999

Gotti Jr. has been tried four times since 2005 for racketeering. Each trial ended in a hung jury. He said he left organized crime in 1999. His father died in prison in 2002

'In 2010, I shredded it. I had completed 375 pages and I shredded 375 pages. I only had 70 pages more to go. So I apologized to everyone involved, but my family harmony is more important to me.'

When he learned of Alite's tell-all, Gotti changed his mind and went to his mother to ask permission to write the book.

'If you never talk to me again, then I’m gonna have to live with it,' he said to his mother. 'That’s your choice, that’s your prerogative, but you’re asking me to sit here and let them emasculate me and my father. No, Ma. I have the right to write our own history.'
