Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire has been put on the market - with a price tag that hopes to fetch more than £200million (about US$301million).

The famous luxury hotel, which is known for its three golf courses and also hosted the prestigious Ryder Cup in 2014, boasts 232 bedrooms and 14 function rooms.

It also includes Scotland's only two Michelin-starred restaurant, run by chef Andrew Fairlie.

Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland, has recently been put on the market for a staggering £200million by owners, Diageo

The Hotel is home to three famous golf courses, including the PGA course, and, last year, hosted the prestigious Ryder Cup tournament

The view from the PGA course's 8th hole is absolutely breathtaking, overlooking the rolling Perthshire hills 

Gleneagles has been put on the market by owners Diageo, who have been operating the property since 1984.

Back in 1998, the drinks company attempted to sell the sprawling hotel, which sits on its own 850-acre estate, but did not receive the amount they were hoping for, which was believed to be about £100m.

It is understood that this time, there have already been several expressions of interest.

But this time around, industry experts believe that the hotel could raise even more than its current £200m price tag.

Especially following the notoriety that the hotel has gained from hosting last year's Ryder Cup, which attracted 250,000 fans from 96 countries.

It's believed that property firm Jones Lang LaSalle are overseeing the sale. 

Gleneagles is also home to Scotland's only two Michelin star restaurant and houses 262 palatial guestrooms on its estate 

For those who aren't at home on the green, the hotel also offers extensive spa facilities and well-appointed suites for relaxing in

Conveniently, the property is nearby to the train station, which exclusively services the hotel, on the Sterling to Perth line

Many of the suites' sitting areas offer unobstructed views of the rolling mountains and the picturesque countryside

The hotel sits on 850 acres in the middle of rolling Scottish hills, which offers plenty of space for activities from falconry to gundog school

A spokesman for Diageo told STV: 'Gleneagles is one of the UK's finest luxury hotels and one of the world's most fantastic golf resorts.

'We are sure there are many people who would love to own Gleneagles and have received numerous expressions of interest over the years, and particularly since the Ryder Cup.

'As you would expect, we have a duty to consider such interest carefully.'

Although Diageo has attempted to sell the stunning property before - in 1998 - the drinks giant was unable to attract the £100m requested

The hotel, which boasts impressive gardens, originally opened in 1924, after being conceived of by Donald Matheson in 1910

The hotel originally opened in 1924.

It was conceived by Donald Matheson, who was the then-general manager of the Caledonian Railway.

Matheson was said to be so impressed by the breathtaking Perthshire countryside that he developed the idea of a palace-like hotel surrounded by golf courses.

A good night's sleep is all but guaranteed in the hotel's stylish guestrooms, like this one, accented with subtle metallics and red pillows

For those who aren't at home on the green, the hotel also offers extensive spa facilities and alternative health and fitness programmes

Although there are many acclaimed restaurants to enjoy, guests can also dine in the comfort of their room - or terrace

For those who aren't avid golfers, the hotel has since added on extensive spa facilities and offer a wide range of alternative health and fitness specialists for guests to consult, as well as a range of activities, from falconry to wildlife photography.

Adding to the property's worth is the nearby train station, which exclusively services the hotel on the Sterling to Perth line.

Located two miles away, it was recently upgraded for the Ryder Cup.
