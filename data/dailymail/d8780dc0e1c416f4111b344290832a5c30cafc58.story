A girl of nine died in her father's arms on Christmas Day just hours after a junior doctor wrongly sent her home, an inquest was told.

Rhianna Rawding, who was born with kidney problems, was rushed to hospital after falling ill with a severe water infection.

She was examined by a junior doctor but, despite being unable to walk or breathe properly and suffering purple blotches on freezing cold feet – a possible symptom of septicaemia or blood poisoning – Rhianna was discharged and told to simply take antibiotics instead.

However, less than six hours later the youngster was dead. She suffered a massive heart attack and died of septicaemia at around 6.30am Christmas morning.

Yesterday her parents, Gemma and Justin Rawding, accused the NHS of 'gambling' with their daughter's life after a coroner said she should never have been sent home from hospital.

Mr Rawding, 39, a forklift truck driver, said: 'We certainly feel the doctors let her down, they could have done more.

'We felt something was very wrong and kept expressing our concerns, but they didn't want to know.

'I know that the NHS is pressed, I know that they can be understaffed but it's not acceptable to say we can't have senior doctors examine patients.

'I feel like they were taking a gamble sending us home and they shouldn't be able to take shortcuts or put lives at risk.

'No-one wants to be in hospital on Christmas but I would rather have waited another two hours and made sure Rhianna was seen by the right people.

'We feel that something could have been done if they had been monitoring her.

Gemma and Justin Rawdings said they were 'extremely reluctant' to return home with their daughter on Christmas Eve last year

'The tragedy for us is that we will never know what would have happened if she had stayed in hospital and not been sent home.'

Mrs Rawding, a support worker for adults with learning difficulties, added: 'The whole family has been absolutely devastated by Rhianna's death.

'We believe she would be alive today if she had had better care.'

Rhianna, described as a 'bright, loving and funny little girl,' was diagnosed with a duplex kidney aged 18 months. The relatively common condition meant she had two kidneys on her left side, but only one was working correctly, leaving her susceptible to regular urinary tract or water infections.

The inquest, at Southwark Coroner's Court, was told that, despite her problems, Rhianna, of Medway, Kent, lived a 'pretty normal' life.

But on Saturday December 22 last year the schoolgirl began complaining of stomach ache, nausea and a headache.

When she hadn't improved by Christmas Eve, her parents took her to the family GP, who confirmed she had a water infection and prescribed antibiotics.

She was examined by a junior doctor at Lewisham Hospital but, despite being unable to walk or breathe properly and suffering purple blotches on freezing cold feet ¿ a possible symptom of septicaemia or blood poisoning ¿ Rhianna was discharged

Later that night, however, Rhianna's condition worsened and she began struggling to breathe.

Her parents noticed purple blotches or bruising to her feet and decided to take her to Lewisham Hospital, where she was seen by junior doctor James Connors at around 12.30am.

The medic, who qualified four years earlier, but had been working in paediatric A&E for just a month, said he 'didn't think' to take the youngster's blood pressure.

The test, the court heard, may have shown Rihanna to have low blood pressure - a symptom often associated with blood poisoning.

Mr Rawding added: 'I told him we'd never seen her as poorly as this before, we were concerned that it wasn't just a water infection.

'The doctor went to speak to a senior paediatrician but when he came back said the best thing was to discharge her and see if there was improvement within 48 hours.'

Fighting back tears, he told the hearing: 'We knew something wasn't right. I had never seen her like that. We left it to the professionals as we thought they knew best.'

Dr Tina Sajjanhar, a more senior doctor at the hospital with 15 years' experience, said she would most likely have admitted the youngster.

'It is very difficult to disagree with the father's view that Rhianna should have been kept in for observation,' she said. ' We tell doctors to take parents' concerns into consideration as they can be very astute.'

The couple returned home 'extremely reluctantly' at around 2.30am but at 6.30am Rhianna was still complaining of feeling cold, so Mrs Rawding went to run her a hot bath.

As Mr Rawding picked up his daughter to take her to bathroom she suffered a massive heart attack and stopped breathing.

The couple, who are taking legal action against the hospital, tried to resuscitate her while waiting for an ambulance, but nothing could be done and she was pronounced dead two hours later.

Coroner Dr Phillip Barlow refused an application by the hospital that Rhianna died of natural causes.

Instead he delivered a narrative verdict, saying: 'It seems to me that if she had been seen by a more experienced doctor she would probably have been kept in for observation and …further deterioration would have become more apparent during the early hours of Christmas morning and would have been acted on more quickly.'

However, the coroner stressed it was impossible for him to say 'on the balance of probabilities' whether she would have survived.

The couple's solicitor, Beth Reay, of Manchester-based JMW Solicitors, said the Rawdings had 'lost everything they lived for.'

'We are very concerned about the care provided to Rhianna as some quite basic checks were not done,' Mrs Reay said. 'It is also very worrying that her parents reported symptoms to hospital staff that indicated she was suffering from septicaemia yet she was not kept in for observation.'
