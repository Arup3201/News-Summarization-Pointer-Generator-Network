Ryan Seacrest has been a fixture on the red carpet and on the small screen for years but now he's landed hosting deals on all four major networks and is successfully expanding his ever-growing lifestyle brand.

The American Idol host turned 'every show' host signed a deal with CBS on Tuesday to host a show called Fashion Rocks.

Seacrest already has deals to host New Year’s Rockin' Eve with ABC, American Idol with FOX, and has a long running deal with NBC.

CNN reports that CBS was one of the only English speaking networks left Seacrest didn't have a deal with yet.

The Hollywood Reporter states that NBC also extended Seacrest's deal with them for one more year.

'This new deal will include hosting and producing 2015 Live from the Red Carpet events for E! contributing to E! News, as well as hosting and producing specials for E! and NBC,' said a network spokeswoman.

The Hollywood Reporter said that rumours circulated claiming Ryan would stop hosting shows on the red carpet but such is not the case.

Ryan reportedly felt as though he'd outgrown hosting the red carpet shows and that he wanted to move on to other ventures.

'I felt like I had been there for a long time, and I wanted to think about whether or not it fit into the full scope of what my focus was going to be in the years to come,' he told The Hollywood Reporter.

What are missing from Ryan's new deal are offers to host NBC News' Today show or to host a show on NBC Sports.

Seacrest has expressed interest in both the news and sports divisions and said that he's been conversing with NBC sports about possibly covering the Olympics in Rio in 2016.

The Today Show is a less likely position for Ryan as he has a morning radio schedule that keeps him in LA while the NBC show broadcasts out of New York.

One of the reasons Seacrest decided to continue his red carpet reporting is because of his long standing friendship with NBCU executives Steve Burke and Bonnie Hammer.

'They've been very good to me,' Seacrest told The Hollywood Reporter.

The deal to host Fashion Rocks on CBS was born out of a similar friendship with CBS' music and specials chief Jack Sussman, Richard Beckman of Three Lions Entertainment, and producer Don Mischer.

Not only will Seacrest get hosting credits from his new wardrobe driven show, Macy's Department Store will sell a collection in Seacrest's name which will add more to his lifestyle brand.

'I'm certainly not a designer, but I do enjoy the process of picking out a great suit and putting a tie with it, and then adding cufflinks and the tie clip,' he told the Hollywood Reporter.

'This is a chance to curate some cool, classic styles that start with suits and accessories but could eventually grow into other lifestyle opportunities, he added.

Seacrest is reportedly planning a live radio broadcast from Herald Square in Manhattan just before Fashion Week to promote his Macy's lifestyle line as well.

Not only is Seacrest hosting on all the big networks, he's investing in companies like the YouTube event  group  called DigiTour, the marketing company Civic Entertainment Group, along with start-ups like Pinterest, Flightcar, and TYPO.

Despite moving forward on all fronts Seacrest still loves hosting the music competition American Idol and says that those types of competitions are 'part of his DNA.'

He's commended the strong relationship and chemistry he has with his fellow Idol hosts Billy ray Cyrus, Jennifer Lopez, and Harry Connick Jr.

Seacrest is also still committed to his $25 million radio deal with Clear Channel.

Seacrest has called his routine morning radio deal, 'the engine that drives everything else.'
