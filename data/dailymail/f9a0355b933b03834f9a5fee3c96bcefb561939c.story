Home Secretary Theresa May has warned that people travelling from Scotland to England will be forced to show their passports if the country becomes independent

Scots will be forced to show their passports when visiting relatives and friends in England if the  country becomes independent, Home Secretary Theresa May has warned.

In a major intervention in the referendum debate, the Tory MP yesterday insisted that Westminster would erect border posts near Gretna, Carlisle and Berwick-upon-Tweed.

First Minister Alex Salmond has said a separate Scottish Government would not ‘kick out’ migrants and would welcome more foreigners.

UK ministers are convinced that, without border controls, a separate Scotland would become a ‘back door’ to England for migrants.

Mrs May  told delegates at the Scottish Tory conference that criminals would seek to ‘exploit’ the Border.

Passport checks would force drivers to pull over on key roads to the south such as the A1, A68 and M74, while train passengers would have to endure Eurostar-style checks.

Mr Salmond has claimed that an independent Scotland could join the Common Travel Area alongside Ireland and the remainder of the UK, where there are no border posts.

However, the Irish government’s immigration policies deliberately do not diverge greatly from Westminster’s.

In contrast, Mr Salmond wants to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration by relaxing the rules on minimum salary levels for entry.

Mrs May said: ‘If the people of Scotland vote to leave the UK, there would be profound changes for migration policy. An international border would be created where one does not currently exist.

‘This would have implications for people travelling to visit family, go on holiday or do business – and for our economies more generally.

‘Buried deep in Alex Salmond’s White Paper is the admission that, just like the last Labour Government, a separate Scotland would pursue a looser immigration policy. T

'hat would undermine the work we have done since 2010, and the continuing UK could not allow Scotland to become a convenient landing point for migration into the United Kingdom.

‘So that would mean border controls. Passport checks to visit friends and relatives. A literal and figurative barrier between our nations.’

There are an estimated 23million vehicle crossings per year in both directions and seven million rail passenger journeys.

The 800,000 Scots who live south of the Border, and the 400,000 English people who live in Scotland would  be particularly inconvenienced when trying to visit friends and relatives.

In her wide-ranging speech, Mrs May also claimed the battle against crime could be harmed by Scottish independence. ‘Criminals do not respect borders but rather work to exploit them,’ she said.

‘Never before has crime been so international. Organised criminal networks, and the internet, mean that people on the other side of the world can orchestrate crimes without even setting foot in this country.

‘So we shouldn’t make life any easier for them by erecting another international border in the middle of our United Kingdom.

‘Borders bring with them bureaucracy, delays and legal impediments. For instance, police officers from the UK and a separate Scottish state would no longer have powers to arrest or detain criminals in each others’ jurisdictions.’
