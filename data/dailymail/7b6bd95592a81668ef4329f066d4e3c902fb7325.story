For the child who has everything, now there's chocolate flavoured toothpaste - which costs £60 per tube.

Luxury oral care firm Theodent use an extract from the cacao plant instead of flouride, something they say is a family-friendly alternative substance, not least because it tastes like pudding.

'Harnessing the power of the cocoa 
bean', the patented ingredient dubbed Rennou is a safe-to-swallow replacement to toxic fluoride present in most toothpastes.

Theodent 300 represents the extra-strength version of the proprietary formulation - at 10x the cost

If users choose to swallow the chocolate-tasting toothpaste, they'll also be swallowing their own plaque

But if users choose to swallow the chocolate-tasting toothpaste, they'll also be swallowing their own plaque.

The toothpaste range is available through Theodent's website, through which they ship worldwide, and at select Whole Foods Markets.

Other credentials include that the range is fluoride free, using theobromine, calcium, and phosphate to create a natural alternative, say Food Beast.

Theodent also claims that these compounds not only clean teeth, but actually build up your enamel, making your pearly whites even stronger.

As for why it costs such a steep price remains to be seen. The classic toothpaste claims to only cost £6 ($10), but is currently unavailable for purchase on the website.

But the Theodent 300 - the extra strength paste with extra high doses of rennou - is available for purchase, costing £61 ($99.99) per tube. Multipacks raise the price even higher and shipping costs also apply.

One case containing 30 tubes of Theodent Kids toothpaste costs £161

Theodent Classic is not harmful if swallowed, making it an ideal family product - unfortunately it's sold out

It promises a rich, creamy cocoa flavour to satisfy even the  most indulgent sweet tooth.

No, it is not a naughty, gooey dessert - but rather a toothpaste that tastes like chocolate.

They
 sound like the most unlikely of bedfellows, but a US company has 
launched the new flavour for customers with an ‘adventurous spirit or a 
sweet tooth’.

Mint Chocolate Trek is part of the brand's new 
line called Be, which features two other nontraditional flavors, Vanilla
 Mint Spark and Lime Spearmint Zest

Priced £3, the Mint Chocolate Trek flavour, pictured, is part of Procter
 & Gamble’s new Crest ‘Be’ line, which also includes Vanilla Mint 
Spark and Lime Spearmint Zest. And the toothpastes will still be good 
for teeth as they also contain sodium flouride.

The firm said it was 
responding to feedback from customers who said they found toothpaste 
boring. Depending on its success, the line could soon come to Britain.

John
 Scarchilli, head of scientific communications for Procter & Gamble,
 said that getting the flavour exactly right was difficult.

‘We 
actually use a proprietary flavouring-and-cooling technology that delays
 the onset of the mint, to let the chocolate make the first impression,’
 he said.

‘Holding back the mint long enough – 30 to 40 seconds – lets the chocolate be satisfying.’

But whatever flavour you choose, dental experts recommend brushing twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste.
