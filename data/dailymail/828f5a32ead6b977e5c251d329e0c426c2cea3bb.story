Mauricio Pochettino describes his time at Southampton as the best in his life but is not sure of the reception he will receive from his former club’s fans.

The Tottenham manager on Sunday will  face the Saints for the first time since leaving the club at the end of last season when the pair meet at White Hart Lane. 

Spurs have struggled to fully exert themselves on the Premier League under his regime and this represents a tough proposition against visitors who have won four of their five competitive games away from home under new manager Ronald Koeman.

Pochettino enjoyed a successful 18 month spell as Saints manager before he joined Tottenham 

Pochettino said: ‘Southampton was the best period in my life. A lot of people love me from Southampton and I have good memories. I’m happy for their start to the League.

‘In your life you need to make decisions. When I take a decision I always believe. Maybe you have luck or not but when you take a decision you need to look forward.’

Even after wholesale changes during the summer — in which Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers were sold — Koeman has continued the progress of the past four years.

That does not come as a surprise to Pochettino, who said: ‘He’s a very good manager. He showed at Feyenoord, Benfica and Valencia that he is a great manager.’

And Koeman believes a change in philosophy has helped turn Southampton into surprise Champions League contenders.

Pochettino used to put on gruelling double training sessions, prompting midfielder Jack Cork to say he needed ‘two hearts’ to get through matches.

But Koeman said: ‘I am not a coach who thinks the physical side is not important, but it isn’t more important than the session with the ball. I still believe in dominating the game to have good possession. I am Dutch, we like to train like that.’
