A chronically ill teenager, forced to drop out of school because of her reactive arthritis, has had a complete stranger come to her aid, allowing the young woman to fulfil her ‘high school formal’ dream.

Mikaela Peters, a 17-year-old living on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, says she was blown away because she ‘didn’t think there were people like that existed any more.’

When she posted a photo on a public Facebook page, explaining her story and trying to sell the dress, photographer Katie Barnett offered a complimentary photo shoot to give her to opportunity to ‘feel beautiful in the dress’.

Ms Peters, who suffers from reactive arthritis says the shoot was ‘amazing, the best experience I’ve ever had.’

'Words can't explain it. I feel so much better about life. It still helps me,' Ms Peters told Daily Mail Australia.

Mikaela Peters, a 17-year-old who suffers from the chronic disease 'reactive arthritis' was forced to drop out of school due to illness, so felt it would have been too upsetting to go to the school formal

The original post on Facebook, when Mikaela Peters tries to sell her 'dream dress'

The 17-year-old suffers from reactive arthritis and, despite doing everything she could, in February it became clear that she could not continue at school.

Mikaela was invited to the formal, but couldn’t bring herself to go. She listed her dress for sale on the Sunny Coast Community Board on Facebook.

‘I’m allowed to go to the formal but it wouldn’t be the same. School means a lot to me and would be too upsetting to attend (the formal),’ she wrote.

The school girl was forced to sell her dream formal dress explaining, ‘I’m desperate (to sell the dress) as having it around is hard for me! This is my dream formal dress so it’s a very hard sale!

‘Unfortunately we bought it at the start of the year hoping I would stay well enough to stay in school and go to the formal.

‘Since, I have become extremely chronically ill and had to leave school,’ she wrote.

Katie Barnett's kind response, offering a free photo shoot in the dress

The young woman was offered a free glamour shoot from a photographer who saw Miss Peters Facebook post, trying to sell her 'dream dress' because it was too difficult to own the dress, knowing she could not wear it at the school formal

Her reactive arthritis causes the young woman so much pain that she is unable to stay standing or sitting for the duration of a lesson.

Her medication also weakens her immune system, making her incredibly ill if she comes in contact with even the mildest contagious diseases.

Ms Barnett, a teacher and part-time photographer, was moved by Ms Peters’ story and commented on the post, offered the teen a glamour shoot with the dress before she had to give it away.

‘I was just happy to do something nice for someone so deserving.

‘I wanted to give her an opportunity to wear the dress and do something special, because she’s been going through such a tough time,’ Ms Barnett told Daily Mail Australia.

‘When she described it as her “dream dress”, I realised just how much it meant to her.

Understanding that going to the formal wasn't an option, Ms Barnett wanted to give the teen her own happy memory. 

‘When she said going to the formal would have been too difficult, I wanted to give her a positive memory with the dress without having to go through the difficult emotions.’

The shoot took an entire day and captured more than 90 photos. The photographer, Katie Barnett, also paid for Mikaela Peters to have her make up done to enjoy a 'glamorous, special' day

The shoot took an entire day and they captured more than 90 photos.

Ms Barnett not only took the photographs, but paid for a professional makeup artist to help with Ms Peters’ special day.

‘It was a great experience to meet her. She’s such a lovely girl and it was fun to spend the day making her feel pampered. She really deserves it,’ said Ms Barnett.

Ms Peters also took some photos in her big sister Krystie’s 21st dress as a way of saying thank you.

‘My sister has been amazing and has helped me a lot. She’s a paramedic and is so supportive.

‘I wore her dress because it’s special and as my way of saying thank you to her,' said Ms Peters.

Ms Peters is looking to the future, and hope to become a paramedic one day, just like her beloved big sister.

Ms Peters says her condition is still the same, but is working through the pain. She is currently working fulltime and looking forward to finishing her studies through a bridging course at university.

As a teacher, Ms Barnett says she was also drawn to the story due to Ms Peters’ desire to learn.

‘I was disappointed that Mikaela had to drop out of school, because I’m passionate about encouraging my students and helping them feel motivated,' said Ms Barnett.

‘We spoke during the shoot about what she’s been going through, so I had the opportunity to speak to her and tell her to keep going to fulfil her dream of being a paramedic,’ Ms Barnett told Daily Mail Australia.'

The Sunshine Coast teen received the photos a week ago when she was discharged from hospital, which helped to lift her spirits.

‘After having met her, I can see that my photos have captured not only her external beauty, but also her internal beauty,’ said the photographer, Ms Barnett.

‘After having met her, I can see that my photos have captured not only her external beauty, but also her internal beauty,’ said Ms Barnett.

‘It was so nice to give her the photos. She was blown away and sent me a beautiful email saying the photos made her fall in love with the beautiful photo shoot all over again.’

Ms Peters is now being inundated with offers from people who have heard her story. 

This includes people who want to help her manage her pain, through complimentary physical therapy and holistic healing, in the hope the resilient young woman does not have to miss out on any more opportunities due to her poor health.

‘Going through her sickness must be hard, but she now has the support of the whole community,’ Ms Barnett told Daily Mail Australia.

‘There’s so much negativity in the world but we can do so much to make the world a better place by pulling together and supporting each other.

‘I thought it was just a small little gesture to help brighten her day!'

The 17-year-old did not sell the dress. 

She still has it hanging up in her closet, because it is now a reminder of a wonderful experience.
