Slaven Bilic has hailed Arsenal as one of Europe's best ahead of their Champions League play-off showdown this month, but he also believes that Besiktas are more than capable of victory over Arsene Wenger's side.

The Gunners are set to travel to Istanbul for the first leg of the tie on August 19, before the return leg at the Emirates Stadium eight days later.

For the winner, a vital place in the Champions League group stage, whilst the loser will be relegated to a spot in the Europa League.

Bilic played for four years in the Premier League with West Ham and Everton, but is probably more famous for leading Croatia to victory at Wembley in 2007 and preventing England from qualifying for Euro 2008, is relishing his potiential return to notoriety in England. 

'Arsenal are one of the best teams in Europe. We took one of the most difficult draws,' said Bilic. 

'This is without a doubt a match when Arsenal are the favourite. We have great respect for Arsenal. We have hope and plan. We will try to implement this plan.

Bilic believes his side can also take inspiration from the 1-0 45-minute friendly victory over Chelsea in Turkey on Friday.

'We will be brave and we will do our best to eliminate them, he added. 'The football we played against Chelsea, gave the signal to us about this match. If we can deal with Chelsea we can cope with Arsenal.'
