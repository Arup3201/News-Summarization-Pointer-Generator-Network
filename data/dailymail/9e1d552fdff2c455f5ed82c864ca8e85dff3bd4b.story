Two lawmakers involved in yesterday's grilling of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson at a House committee hearing and the House Minority Leader now say the security chief should be relieved of her duties.

The Members of Congress' change of heart came after two news organizations revealed on Tuesday night that just three days before a knife-wielding veteran broke into the White House, the Secret Service inadvertently let an armed man who was not part of Obama's security detail ride in an elevator with him.

Reps. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, and Elijah Cummings, a Democrat who represents Maryland, both offered a vote of no confidence in Pierson's ability to lead the beleaguered government agency in light of the new information.

'It's time that she be fired by the president of the United States or she resign,' Chaffetz said on Tuesday evening.  

Cummings shared a similar sentiment with MSNBC on Wednesday. 'I have come to the conclusion that my confidence and my trust in this director, Ms. Pierson, has eroded,' he said, 'and I do not feel comfortable with her in that position.'

A third member, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, also chimed in on Wednesday, saying she agreed with Cummings.

Two senior members of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings, now say that Secret Service Director Julia Pierson, pictured here at yesterday's hearing before the committee, should be canned

The lawmakers' change of heart came after it was revealed on Tuesday evewning that President Barack Obama rode in the same elevator as a man carrying a handgun when he visited the CDC on September 16

'If Mr. Cummings thinks that she should go, I subscribe to his recommendation,' Pelosi said in a statement reported on by Time. 'I am subscribing to his superior judgment and knowledge on the subject.  

The startling revelation that the Commander-in-Chief's security was compromised a second time last month came hours after members of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee interrupted their fall break to come back to Washington and question Pierson about the recent lapses in security.

The newest security slip up happened on Obama's September 16 trip to Atlanta, Georgia, for a briefing on the Ebola crisis at a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facility.

At the CDC, Obama and his security detail where in an elevator when a contract security officer operating the lift began taking photos and video of the president.

Sources told the Washington Examiner and Washington Post that the unnamed CDC officer ignored Secret Service orders to out the phone away, but he continued to act 'oddly' and 'unprofessionally.'

When the president exited the elevator, Secret Service staff stayed behind to question the CDC employee with his supervisor, at which point they discovered he had was carrying a gun. 

The Washington Post reported that the man also had three prior convictions for assault and battery, but the Associated Press disputes that claim. 

AP said Wednesday it had not been able to confirm that the man had in fact been convicted of the crimes and pointed out that felons are not allowed own or operate guns.

Either way, the Secret Service is supposed to conduct background checks on employees who work at venues the president will visit, and only law enforcement are allowed to carry guns in the the president's presence.

Chaffetz was outraged on Tuesday to find about another Secret Service indiscretion.

'You have a convicted felon within arm’s reach of the president, and they never did a background check. Words aren’t strong enough for the outrage I feel for the safety of the president and his family,' Chaffetz told the Washington Post.

'His life was in danger. This country would be a different world today if he had pulled out his gun,' he added.

Pierson is reportedly having a top agency manager look into the matter. 

Pierson apologized for a Sept. 19 White House perimeter breach by a man carrying a knife at yesterday's hearing only to find agency under scrutiny for another security lapse hours later

The besieged government official already had her plate full on Tuesday after having spent three hours under interrogation before the Oversight committee.

In Tuesday's hearing Pierson disclosed that at least two uniformed officers noticed Army veteran Omar J Gonzales acting strange outside the White House just before he jumped the fence and made it all the way to the East Room on September 19.

Gonzalez had been stopped outside the White House before while carrying a small hatchet on August 25 and the officers remembered him from that run-in. Yet they did not take action before the recent incident, Pierson said, after observing him 'for some time.'

'It is clear that our security plan was not executed properly,' she told lawmakers. 'I take full responsibility; what happened is unacceptable and it will never happen again.'

Members of Congress from both political parties have been unimpressed with her apology, however.

'I am deeply concerned with the lack of transparency from the Secret Service regarding the recent security breach at the White House,' House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul said on Tuesday, referring to the Sept. 19 incident.

'This latest episode adds to the growing list of failures from an agency plagued by operational challenges, cultural problems and reporting difficulties,' the Texas Republican said.

McCaul is pushing for an independent review of the Secret Service. 

AP noted that since the White House break in no Secret Service agents have been fired or even demoted. 

House Speaker John Boehner seconded McCaul's request on Wednesday, saying that given duties of the Secret Service, 'we are right to expect nothing but candor and clarity from its leaders.' 

'The more we discover, the clearer it becomes that the Secret Service is beset by a culture of complacency and incompetence,' Boehner said in a statement.

'As such, the president must make a swift determination on whether the agency is being well-served by its current leadership.

'Moreover, I fully support Chairman McCaul’s plan for a top-to-bottom, independent review of the agency. The courageous men and women of the Secret Service who put their lives in harm’s way every day deserve the best possible leadership and a culture worthy of their sacrifices,' Boehner said.

Pelosi said on Wednesday that she also supports an independent investigation in the agency, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security.

After calling for Pierson to be canned, the top Democrat noted that the Secret Service director is not the only person at fault for the barrage of security breaches.

'[T]his is more than one person because there were problems before she went there,' Pelosi said, according to Time. 

'Her leaving doesn’t end the need for us to know a lot more about what is happening,' the California Congresswoman said.
