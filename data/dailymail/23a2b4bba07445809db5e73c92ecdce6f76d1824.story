Tories in the Treasury were accused yesterday of blocking moves to charge for plastic carrier bags in English supermarkets.

Liberal Democrats said there was conclusive proof charging would cut the use of plastic bags, but the Treasury did not want to force a levy on supermarkets before the election because it would be unpopular with voters.

England is the only part of the UK holding out against the policy. Charges are already in effect in Wales and Northern Ireland, and Scotland is planning to introduce one next year.

A senior Lib Dem said: ‘It is the Tories in the Treasury who are blocking this.

‘They believe households would hate it, and that that is more important than the environmental consequences.’ 

While the issue has divided Coalition ministers, some Conservative MPs, including Zac Goldsmith, David Cameron¿s former green adviser, support a levy

Plastic carrier bags from supermarkets are used for an average of just 
20 minutes, but survive for hundreds of years, littering the landscape 
and killing marine animals that eat or get tangled in them.

In Wales, where a 5p levy has been in place for over a year, there has been an 81 per cent drop in usage as shoppers take their own bags to stores.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is officially still examining the evidence from Wales.Figures this month revealed the number of bags handed out by supermarkets in England has soared by more than 12 per cent in two years, to seven billion.

While the issue has divided Coalition ministers, some Conservative MPs, including Zac Goldsmith, David Cameron’s former green adviser, support a levy. 

Yesterday a Lib Dem source said: ‘It is still something the party supports, as do many Tories, but there is no movement from the Treasury on it.’ 

A Treasury source said: ‘There are arguments for and against it. All options are being discussed.’  

Earlier this year, the Lib Dems’ environment spokesman in the Lords, Baroness Parminter of Godalming, said charges would deliver financial as well as environmental benefits, as householders pay the ‘hidden costs’ of disposing of millions of plastic bags in their council tax bills.
