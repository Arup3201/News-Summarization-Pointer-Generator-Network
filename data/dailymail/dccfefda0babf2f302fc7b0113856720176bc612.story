Australian steeplechase runner Genevieve LaCaze stage bombed Kylie Minogue's Commonwealth Games closing ceremony performances on Sunday evening.

The game for a laugh track runner waited for an opportune break in the popstar's stellar show - Mingoue's costume change - before making her stage debut at Hampden Park.

Weaving between Kylie's army of topless 
back up dancers, the 24-year-old looked to be in her element as the 
crowd cheered her on.

Games.

There was plenty of reasons to celebrate with Australia coming in second to England with 137 medals.

The closing ceremony saw the official handover to the Gold Coast, the host city of the 2018 games.
