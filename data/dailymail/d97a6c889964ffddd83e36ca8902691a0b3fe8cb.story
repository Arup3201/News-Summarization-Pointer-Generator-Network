A Romanian Big Issue seller, who falsely claimed to be homeless, was jailed today for stealing £50 from the purse of a blind pensioner.

Razvan Dumitru, 22, who lives in a £250,000 four-bedroom terraced house, has 15 aliases and six bogus dates of birth and has been offending since he arrived in the UK without a visa as an 11-year-old with his father and five siblings.

The father-of-two, of Lower Edmonton, north London, was selling the Big Issue outside a Morrisons supermarket in Sutton on November 30, when the theft occurred. He was jailed today for four months.

Under the old EU rules the job gave him self-employed status, a national insurance number and the right to claim benefits.

When 66-year-old Jane Phillips, who recognised his voice, stopped to give him some money he reached into her purse and snatched five £10 notes.

A mother with her two children saw what was going on and a male witness noticed the pensioner was distressed.

Dumitru denied taking the cash and started packing up, but was detained after a struggle with the man, who was assisted by a member of the store's security staff.

Police were called and a sergeant was assisted by two passing off-duty police officers.

Dumitru had £23 in cash in his pocket and the five £10 notes hidden between copies of the Big Issue in his bag.

He pleaded guilty to theft when he appeared at Croydon Magistrates' Court.

Police have said the pensioner was 'over the moon' with the help she received from members of the public and the police and thanked them for their support although the incident has shattered her faith in human nature.

She told police she would regularly give the vendor £1 while shopping, but never took a copy of the magazine because she cannot read.

Dumitru was remanded in custody to Croydon Crown Court for sentencing, where Judge Barbara Cameron told him: 'You have pleaded guilty to a deeply nasty opportunistic theft in the street from a blind woman.

'The offence was committed out of greed when she kindly tendered to you a £1 coin and then felt you touching her purse, exploiting her vulnerability to take £50.

'This was an appalling and reprehensible crime, committed two days after a suspended prison sentence hanging over you ran out.'

Dumitru's lawyer Graham Lloyd told the court: 'Looking at his record it is quite appalling.

'Between the ages of 15 and 17 there are a large number of dishonesty offences and he went into custody for the first time aged 17.'

The court heard the defendant had never learned English during his 11 years in the UK or held down a steady job, except earning £280-£500 per month selling the Big Issue.

Judge Cameron told Dumitru, who has convictions for burglary, theft and attempted theft: 'You exploited your position of trust as a Big Issue seller, wrecking the reputation of those vendors.

'Your income relies on these nasty opportunistic incidents of theft and you have demonstrated little remorse.

'You have failed to understand a blind woman is highly vulnerable in the street and these offences cause enormous distress and effect the confidence of vulnerable people.'

Detective Constable Lee Blunden said:  'At this time of festive cheer and goodwill, it's hard to imagine a less charitable act than stealing from a blind person.

'We would like to thank those members of the public who came forward to help this victim.'
