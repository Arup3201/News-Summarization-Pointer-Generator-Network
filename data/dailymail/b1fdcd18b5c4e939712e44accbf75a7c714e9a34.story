A man has admitted murdering a church organist who was attacked on Christmas Eve.

Jonathan Bowling, 22, pleaded guilty to murdering Alan Greaves when he appeared at Sheffield Crown Court today, court officials said.

Co-defendant Ashley Foster, 21, denies murder and will go on trial later this month.

Killed: Organist Alan Greaves, 68, died after he was attacked on his way to midnight mass last Christmas Eve

Mr Greaves, 68, was beaten in the street as he made his way from his home in High Green, Sheffield, to midnight mass at nearby St Saviour’s Church, last year.

The former social worker suffered severe head injuries in the attack and died three days later.

At his funeral, which took place a 
few hundred metres from where he was assaulted, his widow, Maureen, told
a packed St Saviour’s her husband was a “truly beautiful man”.

Hundreds of people listened to her 
eulogy to her late husband not only in St Saviour’s but also via video 
link in the equally-full St Mary’s Roman Catholic Church, down the road.

Scores of wellwishers could not get 
into either church and stood in freezing temperatures outside, listening
to the many tributes to Mr Greaves, through loud speakers.

Talented: Mr Greaves is pictured at the piano. His widow said she had been left 'devastated' by his death

Bowling, of High Green, appeared in the dock to enter his plea. Judge Roger Keen QC told him he will sentenced following Foster’s trial.

Foster, of Pitsmoor, appeared by videolink from prison. He will go on trial at Sheffield Crown Court on June 24.

Both defendants were remanded in custody today.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
