The wife of a Russian fisherman who went missing during a trip to Siberia has revealed she has proof that he was murdered and eaten by his friends.

Andrei Kurochkin's bones were found in the Siberian forest, allegedly gnawed through, and according to Kurochkin's widow, Olga Kurochkin, the post mortem reveals what she has believed to be true all along

Two fisherman have been accused of carrying her husband's corpse for a fortnight through 
remote snow-bound forests feeding themselves from his flesh until there 
was nothing left after their mode of transport was destroyed.

Accused: Alexei Gorulenko, pictured with his wife Irina, is accused in a criminal trial in Russia of eating his fellow fisherman Andrei Kurochkin

Both the alleged cannibals, Alexei Gorulenko, 35, andÂ  Alexander Abdullaev, 37,  remain free, though one admitted eating his fisherman friend and then retracted the statement, and a fourth man in the group remains missing, feared dead.

Speaking to the Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid, Kurochkin said: 'I've got a copy of the final post-mortem report. It says Andrei was murdered and then dismembered before being eaten.

'The cause of death was definitely not hypothermia or exhaustion.'

According to Kurochkin, the post mortem reveals her husband received three blows to the head and a knife wound, which would suggest Gorulenko and Abdullaev's claims that their friend died of natural causes is false.

The surviving pair were discovered on November 29, 2012 in an emaciated condition after four men set out on the expedition to the East of Russia in August that year.

Gorulenko and Abdullaev now say they became separated from the other two members of their group, and while they cannot be sure what happened to the fourth man, they claim Kurochkin died of 'exposure'.
