A fifth of us will try to cut down on alcohol in 2013 but sadly few will succeed

Just one in 11 people manage to keep their New Year's resolutions for at least six months, according to new research.

Just under half break their resolutions within a fortnight, blaming a lack of will power.

And of those planning to make a New Year's resolution, almost a fifth plan to cut back on alcohol.

The poll of 4,000 adults by Cancer Research UK found 55 per cent have made New Year's resolutions in the past, and 23 per cent have made a resolution for 2013.

When asked how long previous New Year's resolutions had lasted, nine per cent said they stuck to them for at least six months. However, 39 per cent had given up within two weeks.

Of those that plan to or are thinking about giving something up for 2013, 19 per cent said they would cut down on alcohol.

Other popular New Year's resolutions were to spend less money (34 per cent), cut down on chocolate (21 per cent), and go to the gym (22 per cent).

Cancer Research UK is looking for volunteers to sign up for its new fundraising campaign, Dryathlon(TM), which is encouraging people nationwide to test their willpower and take the challenge of staying off alcohol for January, raising money for a good cause at the same time.

Ed Aspel, Head of Dryathlon at Cancer 
Research UK, said: 'We wanted to find out how good the great British 
public are at sticking to those fabled New Year's Resolutions, which it 
turns out we find harder to stick to than we might think.

'We'd encourage the fifth of us 
who already plan to cut down on alcohol to go one step further and give 
Dryathlon a go - by raising some much needed cash to help beat cancer, 
you'll have an even better reason to make it past the two week mark and 
stick to the Resolution for the whole of January.'

1. CHOOSE ONE THING - to start, pick 
one habit that will have the biggest impact on your life if changed and 
focus on it. Planning to hit the gym, give up Facebook and eat better 
all at once is taking on too much, according to research carried out by 
BJ Fogg, a psychologist and author of Persuasive Technology. Do the 
first thing for a month, then you can add more changes.

2. MAKE IT EASY - don't start by 
planning to train for an hour every day or eat nothing but meat and veg 
if that's a huge change in your habits. It won't happen. 'If you're 
working out, aim for five to ten minutes a day,' says Leo Babauta, 
author of The Power Of Less. 'If you're planning to de-clutter your 
home, start with one drawer rather than your whole house.' The positive 
feedback from these tiny goals will help you tackle bigger tasks later.

3. IGNORE THE NEGATIVES - focusing
 on what you're not going to do can lead to a 'behavioural ironic 
rebound' - or, more simply, if you resolve to stop eating cake, you'll 
eat more cake. According to research from Utrecht University in the 
Netherlands, you should focus on positives rather than negatives, such 
as resolving to eat more veg and protein.

4. USE IF/THEN PATTERNS - 
programme your brain as you would a computer and you won't need to 
wrestle with temptation all the time, says Professor Mark Conner of the 
University of Leeds. 'Set up cues that prompt your planned behaviour,' 
he suggests. For instance, 'if I feel hungry before lunch then I will 
eat an apple, not a chocolate bar'. Conserving willpower in this way 
also means you'll have more left over for other things.

5. GET HELP - joining forces with a
 partner boosts your chances of sticking to your resolutions, according 
to Conner's research. When groups were told to make if/then plans with 
and without the help of friends, those who used a support group saw 
vastly increased chances of success. And besides, you'll need someone to
 spot you on the bench.
