It follows last season, when the club ran trains to meetings with both Manchester sides and discounted tickets for fixtures at the likes of Atletico Madrid, Cardiff and Sunderland.

Chelsea's chief executive Ron Gourlay revealed the club's reasons for running a similar scheme this year.

'Our support was among the very best in the country last season, and helped the team achieve some memorable results away from Stamford Bridge,' he said.

'I am delighted that after consultation with the Fans' Forum we are able to reward that loyalty and commitment once more by removing some of the financial burden on our supporters and allowing them to create a special atmosphere for the players all around the country.'

Success: Chelsea fans will be hoping they can cheer on Jose Mourinho's side to glory this season after failing to win any silverware last campaign.
