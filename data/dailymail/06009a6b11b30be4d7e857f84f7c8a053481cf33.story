The CEO of global coffee chain Starbucks is donating $30million to benefit the rehabilitation of U.S. war veterans.

Howard Schultz’s contribution has been earmarked for research into brain trauma and PTSD suffered by thousands of returning soldiers.

This follows Shultz promise last year to hire at least 10,000 veterans and military spouses over the next five years.

Mr Schultz also criticised the U.S. government saying they do a better job of sending people to war than bringing them back from the front line.

‘These young men and women who are coming home from multiple deployments are not coming home to a parade,’ he told CBS News.

‘They're not coming home to a celebration. They're coming home to an American public that really doesn't understand, and never embraced, what these people have done.’

He promised that the donated $30million would be used to fund research and treatment for post-traumatic stress syndrome and traumatic brain injuries suffered by veterans of overseas conflict such as Afghanistan and Iraq.

Mr Schultz added that rehabilitation is the key to utilising traumatised veterans as they are ‘incredibly valuable to American business.’

An estimated 20 per cent of U.S. soldiers suffer from some form of PTSD or depression

‘These life skills can't be taught,’ he said.

‘And what I'm saying is that they're extraordinarily valuable to any business, any institution, any enterprise.’

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events, such as violent assaults, natural disasters, sexual abuse or combat.

It can develop immediately after an event, but sometimes it takes months or years before symptoms emerge.

It is estimated to affect one in three who experience a traumatic event, with symptoms including reviling the experience, insomnia and aggression.

In November last year, Starbucks announced plans to hire 10,000 U.S. army veterans and military spouses.

‘This is not only about hiring baristas,’ Mr Schultz said.

'Starbucks is seeking individuals with experience in everything from leading teams to building and managing complex, global supply chains.'

As the Starbucks expands globally and gets coffee and tea from around the globe, veterans offer international experience and foreign language skills, the company added.

According to recent figures, at least 20 per cent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer from PTSD and/or some form of depression as a result of their armed service, but an estimated 50 per cent of those with PTSD do not seek treatment.

The Congressional Research Service reported 152,985 cases or PTSD within the U.S. Army between 2000 and 2014.

As of January 10 this year, 6,775 U.S. Service members have died in action since 2001 and 51,809 have been injured.
