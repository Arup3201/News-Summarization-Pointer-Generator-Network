Carlos Tevez has been left out of Argentina's provisional World Cup squad despite scoring 19 Serie A goals for Juventus this season.

The former Manchester City striker, who moved to Italy last summer, had been expected to miss out on a place in Alejandro Sabella's 30-man list.

Tevez's fate was confirmed on Tuesday evening, just hours after he was pictured shopping in Milan.

The 30-year-old is currently the third highest goalscorer in Serie A, but has not featured for his country since 2011.

Sabella has opted to pick former Chelsea striker Franco Di Santo, who now plys his trade for Werder Bremen in Germany.

The 25-year-old, who netted just four Bundesliga goals last season, joins Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuain, Sergio Aguero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Rodrigo Palacio among Sabella's forward options.

Martin 
Demichelis, a Premier League winner with Manchester City in his first 
season in England, earned a surprise call-up alongside his team-mate 
Pablo Zabaleta.

Demichelis,
 a veteran of the 2010 finals, had not been called up by Sabella since 
being dropped after a 1-1 draw at home to Bolivia in a South American 
qualifier in November 2011.

Star man: Barcelona forward Lionel Messi is certain of a place on Argentina's plane to Brazil

The 33-year-old, who has 37 caps, put behind him a poor Champions League last-16 performance against Barcelona in February, when he conceded a penalty and was sent off, to secure his place in the centre of the City defence in the title run-in.

Sabella, whose team have often looked unbalanced with a brilliant attack and ordinary rearguard, has noted Demichelis's recent form as he looks to improve his defence for Argentina's tilt at a third World Cup triumph in Brazil.

Another surprise call-up is Catania 
midfielder Fabian Rinaudo, who won one of his four caps under Sabella in
 2011, and is regarded as cover in case regular midfielders Fernando 
Gago or Augusto Fernandez fail to recover from injury in time to be 
included in the definitive squad on June 2.

Right back Gabriel Mercado has earned a chance thanks to his performances for River Plate, who can lift the Argentine league title this weekend.

Sabella named Gago of Boca Juniors, Fernandez of Celta Vigo and Real Madrid's Angel Di Maria who all hope to be fit in time for the tournament in Brazil starting on June 12 in which Argentina face Iran, Bosnia and Nigeria in Group F.

Di Maria is fighting to be fit for Real's Champions League final against Atletico Madrid on May 24.

Notable absentees include Tottenham's record signing Erik Lamela and Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Javier Pastore.

Midfielders: Javier Mascherano (Barcelona), Fernando Gago (Boca Juniors), Lucas Biglia (Lazio), Ever Banega (Newell's Old Boys), Ricardo Alvarez (Inter Milan), Augusto Fernandez (Celta Vigo), Jose Sosa (Atletico Madrid), Angel Di Maria (Real Madrid), Maxi Rodriguez (Newell's Old Boys), Fabian Rinaudo (Catania), Enzo Perez (Benfica)
