An independent Scotland will not be able to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, a senior Games official has warned.

Olympic Committee vice president Sir Craig Reedie said Scottish athletes were highly unlikely to be able to represent their new country at the next games if the country votes for independence next week.

Sir Craig, who is also president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said there would not be enough time between Scottish independence in March 2016 and the start of the Games that summer to allow Scotland into the event.

The revelation comes amid mounting concern in Westminster over a surge in support for independence.

A poll for Sunday Times put the ‘Yes’ camp ahead on 51 per cent to the No camp's 49 per cent.

Panicking Westminster politicians have drawn up a last-minute plan to save the union – promising Scotland sweeping new powers on tax and welfare.

The prospect of missing out on the world’s biggest sporting event will offer the ‘No’ to independence camp further ammunition against separation.

For Scotland to be allowed to compete, the country’s new sporting body will have to show that it is ‘an independent nation recognised by the international community’.

But because of the short time frame between independence and the opening of the Games, Sir Craig told the Observer he thought it would be ‘very, very difficult’ for a newly independent Scottish team to take part.

He said: ‘I have no idea how long that process of recognition will take. In practical terms the IOC has tended to use recognition by the United Nations.

‘Many of the sports will have qualifying competitions that have all but finished. I don't know if it could be done in time. I suspect it would be very, very difficult.’

A working group on Scottish sport, set up by the Scottish Parliament and chaired by former first minister Henry McLeish, concluded in May that a Scottish team at the Rio Games was feasible.

But Sir Craig said: ‘It would be difficult to deliver in time because I simply don't know when an independent Scotland would be recognised by the IOC.’

He said he believed some athletes may choose to continue representing Team GB regardless of the outcome of the vote.

The British Olympic Association, chaired by Lord Coe, said it had not formed a view on what it would do if Scotland voted for independence.
