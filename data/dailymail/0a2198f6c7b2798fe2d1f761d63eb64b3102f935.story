It's the latest off-the-wall craze in celebrity decor – bed linen designed to look like fast food.

Miley Cyrus and socialite Lady Mary Charteris are among those who have posted pictures of their wacky bedspreads online.

The aristocrat, 27, posted a picture of herself swathed in hamburger-print bedding on Instagram, saying: 'Morningggg. #BreakfastInBed'.

Bed linen such as pepperoni pizza duvets are among the bizarre bedspreads sweeping celebrity homes

Another example of the food-themed bed linen available to buy are these hamburger duvet sets

And Cyrus has shown her love of pizza by posting an image of her 'cheesy' duvet cover that looks like a giant pepperoni-topped treat.

Suppliers include Poland's Emotional Rainbow, with pizza prints; B Fiber & Craft which makes broccoli, mushroom and kiwi cushions as well as a baked potato beanbag; and Cafe Press, which features prints of crisps, doughnuts, Smarties, hundreds and thousands – and even Brussels sprouts.
