Sunny Islam, 23, has been jailed indefinitely because of the dangers he poses to women

A Muslim man who raped women to 'teach
them a lesson' for being on the streets at night was jailed indefinitely today
because of the danger he poses to women.

Sunny Islam, 23, who comes from a strict
Muslim family, dragged his terrified victims - including a 15-year-old - from
the street at knifepoint, bound and assaulted them during a two-month reign of
terror.

Police fear that Islam may have attacked many more.

Three of the assaults took place close to his home in Barking, east London, while a fourth occurred in nearby Forest Gate.

Judge Patricia Lees, sentencing him to a
minimum of 11 years, said: 'The
harm you have done to your victims is incalculable.

'The nature and extent of these offences
drives me to the conclusion that you represent an extreme and continuing danger
to women, particularly those out at night.'

He was traced through the number plate of
his girlfriend's car after he kidnapped and raped the 15-year-old in September
2010.

He grabbed her from behind as she walked
home with a friend and bundled her into the car at knifepoint before driving to a
secluded spot where he raped her twice despite her claiming she was only 11
years old.

Judge Lees said: 'You told her you were
going to "teach her a lesson", and similar things were said to the other women.Â 

'Those words are a chilling indictment of your very troubling attitude towards
all of these victims.

'You seem to observe women out at night as
not deserving respect or protection.

After his arrest, Islam's DNA was linked with three other attacks near his home in Barking, east London

'I have no doubt that you were out that
night looking for a victim, as you were on each of these occasions.'

The teen, who feared she would be
murdered, was in court and smiled as her attacker was jailed.

In a victim
impact statement read to the court, she said: 'No one will ever understand the
flashbacks - they are so real. At night, I lay in my bed and it is like I am
there.

'It is like a screen in my mind forcing me
to relive that night again and again.

'People will say time will heal, but I
think time has helped me accept the truth - that I will never escape what has
happened to me.'

After his arrest, Islam's DNA was linked
with three other attacks near his home in Barking, prosecutor Sara Lawson told
Woolwich Crown Court.

The judge said on July 8, 2010 he subjected
a 20-year-old prostitute to 'his trademark double rape' and then tied her up,
repeatedly punched her in the face and stole her wallet.

She said: 'He
treated me like an animal and made me feel worthless - I thought I was going to
die.'

Six days later, in Forest Gate, he struck again on a
28-year-old when he dragged her into his car and forced her to commit a sex
act.

She managed to kick out the back window of his car and escape despite
being throttled.

His fourth victim, also attacked in
September, did not come forward until police found the 31-year-old's blood in
the back of the car along with a knife he used to threaten his victims and
plastic ties he bound them with.

She was repeatedly repeatedly punched in
the face until she was bleeding and then tied up and raped twice.

Islam, who told the jury he was a practising Muslim, was convicted of seven charges of rape, one of sexual assault and one of kidnap at Woolwich Crown Court

Islam, who told the jury he was a
practising Muslim, was convicted of seven charges of rape, one of sexual assault
and one of kidnap.

Tana Adkin, defending, said: 'The only
piece of mitigation is his age. He was 21 at the time of these offences and
comes from something of a strict background.'

His mother, in religious dress, sat with
her covered head bowed throughout and wept as her son was jailed.

Judge Lees said: 'The fact that you have
attacked these women not withstanding your background must represent your own
wholly warped personality.'

After the trial, Det Chief Insp John
Sandlin, of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command who investigated the
offences, said they believed there may be other victims who had not come
forward, but Islam has not been charged with any further offences.
