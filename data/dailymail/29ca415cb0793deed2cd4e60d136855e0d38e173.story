An Only Fools And Horses fan spent 40 hours and £700 getting a huge tattoo of the show inked across his body, only for Hooky Street to be misspelt.

Police officer Sam Hall, 29, from Eltham, south east London, had the black and white design featuring the cast of the BBC comedy show etched onto his right ribcage over the course of two years.

The tattoo also depicts the show's famed logo, and signs for Nelson Mandela House, where the characters live, and Hooky Street  - which takes its name from the slang for stolen or knock-off goods.

On the tattoo, the street, which features heavily in the closing credits, is misspelled 'Hookie Street' - although Mr Hall is adamant its spelling is open to interpretation.

'I did lots of research and other people have tattoos of "Hookie Street", as well as "Hooky Street" or "Hookey Street", so I don’t think it’s wrong,' he said.

The official lyrics of the chorus of the closing theme to the long-running sitcom cite the dodgy market lane as ‘Hooky Street.’ 

As well as the spelling error, Mr Hall has to contend with the fact his girlfriend Laura Simmons, who is mother of his two children,  hates the show because she does not think it is very funny.

'I started getting it done two years ago - it’s my favourite show - every episode is a classic,' said Mr Hall.

'Laura hates it though, and she thinks it’s rubbish.

'But I’m covered in tattoos so she’s got to get used to it, I suppose'

Mr Hall's Sam’s huge inking is meant to portray the show's central characters, but some unsympathetic observers have suggested that many of the images are so distorted they look like different people.

According to one person who saw a picture of the tattoo online, Del Boy looks like greasy car salesman Swiss Toni from the Fast Show sketch comedy, whereas Boycie looks like the actor who plays Rodney, Nicholas Lyndhurst.

Mr Hall, who is leaving the Metropolitan Police after ten years to become a taxi driver, added: 'I don’t care what people think of it, I love it and that’s the main thing.

'The last bit I had done was the writing.

'It was painful but worth the effort.'

Mr Hall loves the tattoo, which features characters from his favourite programme
