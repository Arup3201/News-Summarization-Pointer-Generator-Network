A $22,000 reward is being offered for information on an emaciated pit bull who was discovered zipped inside a suitcase on the streets of New York.

A passer-by found the three-year-old male dog abandoned among trash behind a housing development in the south Bronx on January 22.

It was not clear how long the dog had been in confinement but photographs released by animal rescue workers show him to be in on the brink of death, with his ribs clearly visible and unable to stand.

Skin and bones: A passer-by found the three-year-old male dog abandoned among trash behind a housing development in the south Bronx on January 22

Matt Bershadker, the president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told NBC News it appeared the animal had been 'deprived of food and water, then discarded on a city curb as if it were garbage.'

He continued: 'Such callous disregard for a living creature is unconscionable, and should not go unpunished.'  

Thanks to a generous benefactor, the ASPCA is offering a $22,000 reward for information linked to the animal cruelty case.

Sad story: It was not clear how long the dog had been in confinement - this is the case he was found in

Bright future ahead: It's hoped when he's got the all-clear, the canine can be put up for adoption and find a happier home

It's hoped this will help identify a suspect leading to an arrest and conviction.

The light brown-colored dog is currently  receiving life-saving medical treatment.

It will take months to get him back to a healthy weight. 

It's hoped when he's got the all-clear, the canine can be put up for adoption and find a happier home.
