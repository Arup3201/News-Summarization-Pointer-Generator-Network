A woman who adopted a dog found wandering the streets following a tornado last month has agreed to return the pet to its original family.

Kyla Robinson of Mellott, Indiana said her three-year-old boxer, Rosco, was due to be returned to the Clinton County Humane Society on Tuesday and reunited with the family on Wednesday.

The new owner, who has not been identified, had initially refused to return the animal but was reportedly so moved by stories of the family's heartbreak that she agreed to return the dog.

The family had tied Rosco outside their house in Mellott, Indiana on November 17 and left for a 
baby shower before the tornado ripped through the small town, damaging 
the home.

They returned to 
find Rosco missing and a day later, he was found wandering in Clinton 
County, around 45 minutes away, without any identification or tag.

He
 was taken to the Clinton County Humane Society and, in keeping with the
 shelter's policies, he was put up for adoption and a woman adopted him 
five days later.

The Robinsons, including 10-year-old daughter Madison, posted information about Rosco on a lost pets Facebook page and found out what had happened to their pet in early December.

They pleaded for the pet's return but the new owner initially refused.

But now Robinson said that Rosco's adoptive owner agreed to give him up after she was moved 
by media accounts of how much the family missed their beloved pet.

Damage: They returned home to find their house badly damaged, pictured, and their dog gone

Debris: The dog had been tied up outside at the time and was found 45 minutes away the next day

'This
 lady does have a heart, and she was just thinking of her children too,'
 Robinson told the Journal & Courier. 'It's not her fault that Rosco
 went missing, and I am so thankful that she is giving Rosco back.'

She had previously said that her 10-year-old daughter was devastated by the loss of her animal.

'She still cries,' her mother had said. 'She gets 
upset, but she tries to let go because she thinks that hopefully these 
people will have a heart and give him back.'

But following their plea, the shelter's staff said they were unable to help.

Jim Tate, the director of the human society, said that once an adoption takes place, the new family legally owns the dog and the shelter is unable to return the animal.

Adoption center: Another family adopted him from Clinton County Humane Society, pictured, and the center said that the situation is out of their hands as the dog legally belongs to the new family

'Unfortunately it is out of our hands,' Tate had said.

The
 family thought they might have some success when, with shelter 
officials as mediators, they spoke with the new owners about the dog's 
return. But a deal didn't last long.

Tate said sympathized with both parties.

'For the original owner, I totally understand that they want their dog back. ... I would want him back if he was mine,' he said. 'On the other side, the lady who adopted him said he is bonding with the family and is perfect for what she was looking for. It really is heart-wrenching for both sides.'
