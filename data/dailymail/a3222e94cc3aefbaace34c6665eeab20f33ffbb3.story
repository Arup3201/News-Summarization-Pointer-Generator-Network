The push to reintroduce a royalist title is set to see the ousting top barristers from their roles in Sydney's strongest legal councils.

A vote for the Queen's Counsel title was won at a recent election although the reinstatement had been resisted and criticised by leaders of the NSW Bar Council for some time, The Australian reports.

Those opposing to the reform are now at risk of losing their positions and may be replaced by pro-QC legal practitioners such as NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC, who is the subject of an Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry.

The return of Queen's Counsel title in NSW had previously been rejected back in April as a bipartisan committee found the move was not in the public interest, according to The Australian. 

But last Thursday, pro-QC supporters won 12 of the available 21 positions to govern next year's council.

An election for the Bar Council executive roles will be held on Thursday.

But it is believed the incumbents against the monarchists are under review among them being the Bar Association chief executive Philip Selth and president Jane Needham SC - who had been elected into her role in May.

Other states in Australia - Queensland and Victoria - have already reestablished the royalist title.

A Supreme Court judge denied Ms Cunneen's bid to halt the ICAC inquiry which also involve her son Stephen Wyllie (left) and his girlfriend Sophia Tilley (right)

The election last Thursday saw Ms Cunneen gain one of the highest votes despite ICAC announcing last month of its investigation into the Crown prosecutor over a corruption allegation.

Just yesterday, a Supreme Court judge denied Ms Cunneen's bid to halt the ICAC inquiry which also involve her son Stephen Wyllie and his girlfriend Sophia Tilley.

Justice Clifton Hoeben handed down his decision on Monday afternoon, ruling against Ms Cunneen's contention that the ICAC had no right to investigate a 'malicious' complaint which related to her private life.

The ICAC has alleged Ms Cunneen and her son counselled Ms Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a car crash in May.
