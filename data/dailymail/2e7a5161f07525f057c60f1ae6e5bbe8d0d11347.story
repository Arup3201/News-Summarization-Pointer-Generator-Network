Everton defender Phil Jagielka scored an outstanding equaliser in the closing stages of his side's match to cancel out what appeared to be a winning goal by Steven Gerrard.

Gerrard's former England team-mate Gareth Barry had a nightmare start to the Merseyside derby by receiving a yellow card inside the first two minutes before handling inside the penalty area and hacking down Mario Balotelli. 

However Barry managed to compose himself to stay on the pitch for the remainder of the game. 

Here, Sportsmail's Dominic King gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players.

LIVERPOOL (4-2-3-1)

Simon Mignolet – For some reason, Everton didn’t look to take advantage of his shaking confidence. Never looks like he is totally comfortable –5.5

Javi Manquillo – Nothing headline grabbing from the Spanish right-back but is becoming a dependable figure in Liverpool’s defence – 7

Martin Skrtel – If he was vulnerable at West Ham, he looked commanding here with another week’s training under his belt – 7.5

Martin Skrtel showed why he is one of the first names on Brendan Rodgers' teamsheet with a fine display

Dejan Lovren – Been an erratic start to life at Anfield for the Croatia international but this, a few glitches apart, was his best performance to date – 7

Alberto Moreno – He has made a bright impression since arriving from Sevilla and continued that here, providing energy and stell down the left – 7.5

Steven Gerrard – Big game, big goal, sound display. Relished the opportunity to silence his critics with a dipping free-kick, never wasted a pass – 8  

Steven Gerrard silenced the doubters by scoring what appeared to be the winning goal in the 65th minute

Jordan Henderson – The top midfielder on the pitch. Seemed to covered every yard, passed the wall and relished driving his team forward – 8.5

Raheem Sterling – A thorn in the side of Everton’s defenders, buzzed forward whenever the chance allowed, providing a succession of dangerous balls – 8

Adam Lallana – Growing into the role of a Liverpool player, unlucky not to score against the team he supported as a boy with a thumping header – 7.5

Lazar Markovic – Looks anything but a £20million forward at the minute. Struggled to make any kind of impression and froze whenever he did get the ball – 5

Mario Balotelli – Moments of the sublime, moments of the ridiculous. Should really have finished his first Merseyside derby with two goals – 6

Mario Balotelli came close to scoring his first Premier League goal since joining the red side of Merseyside

Coutinho (for Lallana), Lambert (for Balotelli 88mins)

Jones (GK), Enrique, Toure, Lambert, Coutinho, Lucas, Suso

MANAGER

Brendan Rodgers – Managers get paid to make the crucial decision and in the 64th minute, Rodgers hollered at Balotelli that he wanted Gerrard to take a free-kick rather than the Italian. The result was Liverpool’s goal – 7.5

Brendan Rodgers instructed his captain to take three free-kick which led to Liverpool's opening goal

EVERTON (4-3-3)  

Tim Howard – Undid all the good work of keeping Liverpool at bay in the first 45 minutes when he failed to deal with Gerrard’s free-kick – 5.5 

Tony Hibbert – Rare start for the veteran right-back and found it hard work trying to contain Sterling at times during the second half – 5.5

Phil Jagielka – Everton’s saviour with a goal that will almost certainly rank as the best of his career. Had impressed with his defending too – 8

John Stones – Easy to see why he is being touted as a future England central defender. Composed throughout, worked well with Jagielka – 7

Leighton Baines – Mixed bag from the left-back, some good moments in the first half but not so much in the second period. Energy never dropped – 6.5

James McCarthy – Top midfielder for Everton, tackled everything that came near him and tried to drive his team forward. Passing not always the best – 7

Gareth Barry – Had an erratic first 10 minutes when he was booked and may have been sent-off. Seemed to rattle him for the rest of the game – 5.5

Gareth Barry was lucky to escape a second yellow card inside the opening half of Saturday's match at Anfield

Muhamed Besic – Lots of energy and hard work. Isn’t in the team to do the skilful jobs but a competent first start for Everton nonetheless – 7

Romelu Lukaku – Played on the right of an attacking three but never made any impact after failing to get a penalty in the first couple of minutes – 5

Steven Naismith – Been a key performer for Everton this season but he was played in a different position here and didn’t see enough of the ball – 6

Kevin Mirallas – Was just starting to get into top gear when he damaged his hamstring midway through the first half. Looks set for a lengthy lay-off – 6

Everton's Kevin Mirallas was forced off in the 31st minute after picking up a hamstring injury

SUBS

McGeady 6 (Mirallas 31), Browning (for Hibbert 73), Eto’o (for Besic 80)

UNUSED

Robles (GK), Gibson, Eto’o, Osman, Browning, Alcaraz

MANAGER

Roberto Martinez – Celebrated the equalising goal as if the result was never in doubt. Went with a different formation and seemedmore intent on not losing the contest rather than going to win it – 6.5

Goals – Gerrard (64), Jagielka (90+1)

Booked – Barry, Gerrard

Attendance – 44,511

Referee – Martin Atkinson – 6
