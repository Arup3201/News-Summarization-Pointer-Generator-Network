Manager Mark Hughes is excited by the prospect of Stoke having Victor Moses and Bojan Krkic both fit and firing on the field at the same time.

Following his summer arrival from Chelsea on a season-long loan deal, winger Moses established himself as the Potters' star performer in the early weeks of the campaign before he was sidelined by a thigh injury sustained towards the end of November.

It was at that point that forward Bojan - a summer signing on a permanent deal from Barcelona - was just beginning to really show what he can do in a Stoke shirt, and he has subsequently emerged as their key attacking player in Moses' absence.

Moses made his return to the matchday squad as an unused substitute when the Staffordshire outfit suffered a 3-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at Arsenal last weekend, and he looks set for his playing comeback in Saturday's top-flight trip to Leicester.

And Hughes said of the Nigeria international: 'He is very much in my thoughts for the weekend and hopefully, if he does play, he will be able to hit the performance levels that he was reaching prior to the injury, because he was arguably our best player.

'Thankfully Bojan had come into the team around the same time and took over that mantle, leading from the front with his level of performances.

'If we can get them both firing at the same time, then we should be in good shape.'

Stoke full-back Erik Pieters is a doubt but midfielder Steven Nzonzi should be available for Saturday's contest after both came off at half-time with groin complaints during the Arsenal match.

Frontman Mame Biram Diouf remains on African Nations Cup duty with Senegal.

Hughes' 11th-placed side take on a Leicester outfit who are bottom of the table.

The Foxes were in that position on Christmas Day, and there have only been two seasons in Premier League history where the side in that predicament have gone on to avoid relegation.

Hughes sees it as a 'tough call' as to whether or not Nigel Pearson's men - currently three points adrift of safety - will be able to beat the drop.

But he has no doubt they will face Stoke in buoyant mood after defeating Hull and Aston Villa either side of drawing at Liverpool in their last three league games.

'It is a tough call - historically it is difficult to stay up when you have been bottom at Christmas,' said Hughes, whose team were beaten at home by Leicester in September.

'But it has been done in the past, and they will be encouraged by virtue of their last few games, when they have gone up against good teams and given a good account of themselves and, more importantly, picked up points.'

Meanwhile, Hughes has played down the suggestion that talks over a new Stoke contract for midfielder Glenn Whelan - currently on a deal that runs out this summer - have broken down.

'There needs to be further discussions, but we are hopeful something will be resolved very quickly,' Hughes said.
