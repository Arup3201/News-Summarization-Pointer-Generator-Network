A commuter train that derailed as it entered a small town train station smashed into a lorry carrying a load of cars - but remarkably there were no serious injuries.

The devastation in the wake of the massive collision between the train and the loaded truck has left people questioning how nobody was badly injured.

Local residents in the town of Bartlett, Illinois, north east of Chicago, said they heard a loud 'boom'.

Two passengers travelling on the train reportedly suffered minor injuries from the collision. There were 20 people on the train.

According to CBS Chicago, the crash happened at around 4pm between a Metra V and a car hauler.

Metra spokeswoman Meg Reile said the train was travelling from Elgin towards Chicago and hit the semitrailer as it was arriving at the Bartlett depot.

The crash shut down service on the Milwaukee District West Line. It also damaged and derailed the front car of the train, she said.

The vehicles that were on the car hauler crashed into some of the parked cars at the train station.

Metra is now investigating what caused the collision. A spokesman for the rail firm would not be drawn by the CBS reporter on whether the truck or the train driver was to blame.

Train incidents in America are not uncommon, with several reported this month alone.

In San Francisco, two transit workers were killed on Saturday after being struck by an out-of-service train on a routine maintenance run. The men were assessing a reported dip in the tracks.

One person was killed and 24 injured when a logging truck collided with a sight-seeing train in the West Virginia Mountains earlier in the month.

And in Canada, residents in a small hamlet were evacuated after an cargo train carrying oil derailed and exploded into flames on Saturday.

Residents in Gainford, about 50 miles from Edmonton, were taken to safety when the 13-carriage train, four carrying petroleum crude oil and nine loaded with liquified petroleum gas, exploded at around 1am.

Given the amount of devastation that was caused, local residents and investigators were relieved that the collateral damage was not worse

The crash was reminiscent of the horrific tragic oil tanker train crash in July, which incinerated the small Quebec town of Lac-MÃ©gantic near the Maine border, killing 47 people.

Questions about the increasing use of trains to transport highly flammable fuels are increasing.
