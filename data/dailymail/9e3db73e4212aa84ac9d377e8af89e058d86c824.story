With its grotesque appearance, this gargoyle is hardly the type of ornament most people would like to take pride of place on the mantelpiece.

Yet, despite its hideous looks, people fought over the squat devil-like piece, which was described as an exceptional work of art, when it went under the hammer at the auction house.

And, it ended up being sold for an incredible £66,000 - a world record for such a piece.

You beauty! This gargoyle ornament has sold at auction for a record-breaking £66,000

The gargoyle ornament  was made by 
the celebrated British pottery manufacturers the Martin Brothers at the 
turn of the 20th century.

It sold for 50,000 pounds but with all the fees added on the total price paid for the ornament was 66,000 pounds.

The price is a world record for an item of pottery made by the Martin brothers.

Michael
Jeffery, head of 20th century design at auctioneers Woolley and Wallis 
of Salisbury, Wilts, said: ‘The market is strong for this type of art at
the moment which is reflected in the world record sum.’
