Her blonde hair, petite frame and painted nails could be deceiving, but soaring at 112 miles per hour Ellen Brennan certainly lives up to her title as the fastest flying woman in the world.

After starting wingsuit flying just seven years ago, the 26-year-old American, has quickly established a name for herself in the flying world.

Growing up in New York, she quickly moved to the mountain town of Sallanches, France, to be closer to the hills that she now practices from every day.

Gliding above the ground at over 3,500 metres, she effortlessly sails through the sky, giving the birds a run for their money.

She said: 'I started skydiving with my dad when I was 18, and then when I got bored of that I started BASE jumping from hot air balloons, bridges and small cliffs.

'However I quickly realised that I had the most fun when I was wingsuit jumping from big mountains.

'It was never a huge goal of mine, but as I became bored with the other sports I fell into the world of wingsuiting. I have been flying for seven years now and I can't imagine ever becoming tired in this sport.'

Ellen was originally given the title as the fastest flying women at the World BASE Race in Romsdalen, Norway, after she had won both the Kjerag U-Turn race and the WBR race in Romsdalen.

After then winning the next race in Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland and by being the only girl invited to the WWL, she was able to live up to her name, and keep the title.

She said: 'I was elated when, standing up on the podium at the World Base Race, they announced: Ellen Brennan, the fastest flying woman in the world.

'I thought- 'wow, it's true, with all this hard work I've been putting into wingsuit racing I've made it to the top,' It's a bit surreal. Growing up I've never been particularly great at anything- I tried volleyball, baseball, soccer, but never really excelled.

'Then I found air sports and it changed my life, not only is it ridiculously fun, but I'm good at it.'

Ellen is now a full time jumper and jumps every day weather permitting.

With her highest take off over le Pleureur, Valais, Switzerland, measuring at an astonishing 3.715 metres, she is able to reach the max speed of 112 miles per hour.

She has flown over beauty spots all over the world, including mountainous regions in Norway, Switzerland, China and France.

Miss Brennan, who hopes to be the first to jump from peaks in Nepal as her next challenge, said: 'The reaction I get is usually shock, followed by 'really? you fly wingsuits?

'I think my appearance throws a lot of people off- a petite blonde, with her hair and nails done doesn't look like your 'typical wingsuit flyer. But as my parents taught me- do what makes you happy - and I have never been happier.'
