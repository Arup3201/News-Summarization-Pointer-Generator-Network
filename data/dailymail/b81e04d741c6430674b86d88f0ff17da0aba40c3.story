CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher's verdict as to why Louis van Gaal is fortunate not have the heat on him.

As half-time approached at Loftus Road with their team looking out of sorts once again in an ill-fitting 3-5-2 system, United fans showed their first signs of discontent with the reign of King Louis, demanding a switch to '4-4-2'.

The Dutchman has resolutely stuck to his guns since his arrival and his reluctance to change has had many of the club's faithful scratching their heads.

Here, Sportsmail looks at whether some of the curious goings-on at Old Trafford this season are as bizarre as they seem - and examine whether there is method in the manager's apparent madness.

FORMATIONS

They stuck with their team through the dark days of the David Moyes era and have been relentless with their backing for Louis van Gaal.

But as half-time approached at Loftus Road with their expensively-assembled unit still tip-toeing around each other like strangers at a wedding, United's faithful had had enough.

It came from the back of the School End upper and was stunning in its simplicity. 'Four-four-two,' they chanted. The message could not have been clearer.

Only 24 hours previously Van Gaal had repeated his reasoning for using a 3-5-2 and appeared insulted by the repeated questioning. He still felt it gave his team the best balance, he said.

But while the Dutchman may be stubborn he is not stupid and at the break, with the match at 0-0, he gave supporters what they had noisily demanded.

United went on to win 2-0 with the players seemingly more at ease in a familiar environment. But after the game Van Gaal reiterated his support for his tainted tactic and claimed that while the switch to 4-4-2 saw his team create more chances it also opened them up to the home side.

This may not be the end of the dreaded 3-5-2.

HOW DO YOU SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE (DI) MARIA?

When he broke the British transfer record by paying Real Madrid £59.7m for Angel di Maria, Van Gaal hailed the capture of a 'a world-class midfielder'.

United fans purred at the prospect of the Argentine bringing his talents to Manchester. He was even given the iconic No 7 shirt, reserved for playmakers such as Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo.

So why then, has he started the last two matches as a striker?

Van Gaal would no doubt point to lack of pace up front. He might also state that it is difficult to drop Juan Mata, who appears to be in the best form of his short United career behind the front two.

The experiment, however, has not been a success. Di Maria was in Zurich last week where he was named in Fifpro's 2014 World XI. In midfield.

There is another message for Van Gaal there - and this time it came from 20,000 players across the globe rather than his own fans.

PHIL JONES - CORNER TAKER EXTRAORDINAIRE 

When United won a corner at Loftus Road you may have expected Wayne Rooney, for years the designated taker, to ping it over. Or perhaps one of the many creative talents Van Gaal has at his disposal. Di Maria, maybe, or even Mata.

Step forward Philip Anthony Jones.

The sight of the burly defender trotting over to the corner flag triggered a Twitter meltdown. If football matches took on the format of US TV show Friends, this would be forever remembered as The One Where Jones Took a Corner.

So what does it tell us? Van Gaal is always searching for that surprise element, for that extra 0.5 per cent. Think back to the World Cup and his penalty shootout benching of Jasper Cillessen in favour of Tim Krul.

Some of the responses may have been an over-reaction. At the 2010 World Cup a study found goals from corners came at a rate of one in 70.

That said, this may have been a short-lived experiment.

THE FALCAO CONUNDRUM

The writing appeared to be on the wall ahead of United's trip to London for £6m loan man Radamel Falcao. After an outburst at a lack of opportunities from the player's agent, Van Gaal had reiterated that Falcao still had to prove himself.

However, injury to Robin van Persie gave the Colombian targetman another chance to do just that.

Another scoreless afternoon took his record to three goals in 14 appearances and had some writing the former £50m man off.

They should not. Falcao was twice denied by superb stops from Rob Green, the kind of saves that would make headlines had the brilliant David de Gea pulled them off. In the second half he appeared to miss a sitter from five yards out but on closer inspection a last-ditch touch from Steven Caulker took the chance away from him.

Van Gaal may well have been pleased by the reaction. Falcao's movement was superb and an on another day he may well have walked away with two goals.

It has not gone as well as expected, but there is still time for the big man to give his manager reasons to activate that £43m buyout clause.

THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

The injuries that have left medical staff at Carrington wondering what they did wrong in a previous life have hurt United the most in defence.

Who would have thought that Michael Carrick would be a standout performer at the back? Or that youngsters Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair would be thrust into the spotlight?

Then there is the loss of form to the likes of Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans. 

This was supposed to be the year they stepped forward to fill the void left by the departures of old heads such as Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand. 

They have not and some would say that Van Gaal should have seen that coming. Despite the £156m spent in the summer, reinforcements at the back are desperately needed.

SAY WHAT!? 

David Moyes did himself no favours during his short stint down Sir Matt Busby Way when he came out with some bizarre comments at press conferences. After a numbing 3-0 home defeat at the hands of bitter rivals Liverpool he explained: 'I could see why we were champions today'. Ten days later, after City had repeated the Merseysiders' trick, he was at it again, claiming United should aspire to be at their cross-town rivals level. Oh dear.

At times Van Gaal also seems to have been struck by a case of foot in mouth. You can put his 'Queens Park Raisins' comment down to his accent - but that comical slip of the tongue has not been the only thing lost in translation.

He was at it as early as August when he said that a 4-0 Capital One Cup thumping at League One MK Dons had 'not shocked' him. 

David Moyes was sacked as United boss in April - despite a similar start at Old Trafford as Van Gaal

And as recently as last weekend, after his side failed to register a shot on target in a 1-0 home defeat by Southampton, Van Gaal moaned that United had 'dominated' the game and branded the worthy visitors 'lucky'.

Insiders at United say the manager casts a keen eye over press coverage and insists that he sees all player appearance requests.

A veteran of dealing with the media, he knows what damage a slip of the tongue can do - and that makes comments like those above even more baffling.
