The blue light emitted by phones, tablets and energy efficient lightbulbs are known to disrupt sleep, but U.S. engineers claim to have developed a solution.

Named Drift Light, the LED reduces the amount of blue light that is traditionally emitted from a modern bulb, and also fades to darkness gradually to mimic sunset and even moonlight.

By changing light levels slowly, the company claims the $29 (£17) bulb promotes relaxation and increases levels of the sleep hormone melatonin. 

The Drift Light costs $29 (£17) and reduces the amount of blue light emitted compared to phone screens and other energy efficient bulbs. In Midnight and Moonlight mode, the light gradually fades over the course of 37 minutes, pictured, to mimic a sunset and help people get to sleep naturally

Research shows that almost six in ten people are not getting enough sleep - a 50 per cent increase on just a year ago.

Experts blame the rise on growing numbers of us using smartphones, tablet computers and other gadgets in bed and in the hour or two before turning in.

The blue light emitted by the screens reduces drowsiness and so makes it harder to fall asleep.

Psychologist Professor Wiseman said: ‘The blue light from these devices suppresses the production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and so it’s important to avoid them before bedtime.’

According to the firm’s website: ‘Falling asleep is highly dependent on behaviour.

‘Our bodies don’t adjust well to abrupt changes. Having an easy transition from waking to sleeping helps prepare you for sleep.’

The Drift Light was designed to fade over 37 minutes, which is the average duration of a sunset.

It comes with three modes, all controlled via a light switch on the wall.

In Daylight mode, the switch is used in the same way as a standard light.

To activate Midnight mode, users flick the switch twice. The bulb then blinks to confirm the setting has been activated before fading to dark gradually.

To activate Midnight mode, users flick the switch twice and the bulb fades to dark gradually. By flicking the switch three times, the bulb activates Moonlight mode and fades to low light in 37 minutes

By flicking the switch three times, the bulb will blink twice to activate Moonlight mode and fade to low light in 37 minutes - ideally used as a night light for children.

Makers Saffron claim the Drift Light has an average lifespan of 30,000 hour - 30 times longer than incandescent bulbs.

It also replaces 40W incandescent bulbs with 7W versions, meaning it saves energy too.

This will vary depending on where the person lives and how often they use the bulb, but figures state using the bulb eight hours a day in the U.S. will save an average of $11.28 (£6.65) per year, per bulb.

The initial stock of lights has sold out. It is available in the U.S direct from Saffron’s website, or outside the U.S via SewellDirect.com.

Daylight mode works like a regular bulb but with low levels of blue light

To create a night light, the moonlight mode fades the bulb to low light

By fading slowly, the bulb naturally increases melatonin needed for sleep
