The White House repeatedly declined on Tuesday to offer legal justification for President Barack Obama's forthcoming executive order calling off deportations for certain classes of illegal immigrants. 

Repeating a statement from the president over the weekend, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today that the executive branch would offer an explanation for its actions after Obama had made his announcement

Obama himself had suggested multiple times that he could not go around Congress to freeze deportations because the president is not a 'king'' or an 'emperor' - remarks his spokesman was reminded of today by ABC News' Jon Karl.

The Obama administration official wouldn't say if Obama stood by that statement yet indicated in his response that since the president said that, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security had reviewed the law and come to the conclusion that there are unilateral actions the president can take.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today that the executive branch would offer an explanation for its unilateral immigration actions after President Barack Obama had made a formal announcement

He would not reveal the results of that review to reporters, fearing that it would tip them off to the contents of the president's upcoming declaration.

According to reports, Obama's executive order, which could come as early as Friday, will cover roughly 5 million illegal immigrants who were either brought to the U.S. as children or have young children living in the U.S.

The anticipated measures are seemingly outside the legal boundaries that President Obama, who is a constitutional lawyer by trade, set for himself in remarks on multiple occasions in the past. 

During a February 2013 Google Hangout an immigration activist asked him what authority he had to keep families from being 'broken apart' until Congress passed immigration reforms.

Obama told him: 'This is something that I have struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is, is that I’m the president of the United States, I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.'

In 2010 he explained at a Univision town hall, 'I am president, I am not king,' and therefore he could not personally issue a stay of deportation for 8 million immigrants who would be eligible to stay in the U.S. if comprehensive immigration reforms were enacted by Congress.

'I can’t do these things just by myself,' he said to the chagrin of immigration activists.

In September of last year, Obama told then-Univision host Jose Diaz-Balart that he couldn't expand his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to the parents of illegal immigrants because that would fall into a gray area legally. 

'If we start broadening that, then essentially I’ll be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally,' Obama said. 'So that’s not an option.'

But that's exactly what the president is gearing up to do now, sources familiar with a 10-point plan Obama is considering told Fox News last week.

He may also enlarge DACA to include illegal immigrants of any age who were under 16 when they were brought to the U.S. Currently the executive order requires them to have lived in the U.S. since June 2007 and be under be under the age of 31. The aggrandized rule would allegedly bump the cut-off date up to January 2010.

The White House said today that a review conducted by Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder found that Obama has the authority to make some changes to the immigration system

Earnest today refused to comment on the rumors and suggested that the president may not have even received DHS' recommendations for action yet. The president was so busy during his trip to Asia last week, Earnest said, that he didn't really have time to think about immigration reform.

Grilled by Karl about what had changed since Obama asserted that the didn't have the authority to shield additional groups of illegal immigrants from mandatory removal proceedings, Earnest said that not only had the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security assured the president of his authority, the political climate had shifted.

At the time Obama made those claims, comprehensive immigration reform was still being debated by Congress, Earnest explained. 

The Senate passed that legislation in 2013 but the House did not, he noted, and now there's little to no chance that Republicans in the lower chamber will take up immigration legislation in the near future, creating an opening for Obama to issue his own measures.

Confronted with the argument that Republican leadership in the House was refusing to allow a vote on the president's preferred immigration reform legislation long before Obama's comments last fall, Earnest again pointed to the recent of the law by administration officials whose departments handle immigration.

The dodge came after the president himself refused over the weekend to share the legal rationale for his actions.

Obama was asked about the perceived flip-flop during a press conference in Brisbane, Australia on Sunday.

The president claimed at that time that his 'position hasn’t changed' since his 2010 remarks.

'When I was talking to the advocates, their interest was in me, through executive action, duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress,' he stated, referencing the Univision town hall. 

'And getting a comprehensive deal of the sort that is in the Senate legislation, for example, does extend beyond my legal authorities. There are certain things I cannot do. There are certain limits to what falls within the realm of prosecutorial discretion in terms of how we apply existing immigration laws.'

Obama said the White House had been working with the Office of Legal Counsel to determine what he could in fact do and has been advised that it is within his administration's authority to take such actions such as 'reallocating resources and reprioritizing since we can’t do everything.'

'And it’s on that basis that I’ll be making a decision about any executive actions that I might take,' Obama stated, before claiming as he has many times before that this entire debate would cease if Congress would 'pass a bill I can sign on this issue.'

That law would should include a solution that 'solves our border problems, improves our legal immigration system, and provides a pathway for the 11 million people who are here working in our kitchens, working in farms, making beds in hotels.

'Everybody knows they’re there, we’re not going to deport all of them,' he pointed out. 'We’d like to see them being able, out in the open, to pay their taxes, pay a penalty, get right with the law. 

'Give me a bill that addresses those issues -- I’ll be the first one to sign it and, metaphorically, I’ll crumple up whatever executive actions that we take and we’ll toss them in the wastebasket, because we will now have a law that addresses these issues.'

In reviewing Obama's previous remarks, the Washington Post 's fact-checking division ruled that the president had in fact changed his position on executive authority to act on immigration over the years, despite claiming that he hadn't.

The misleading statement earned him a mild slap on the wrist and one of the publication's upside down Pinocchios.

Obama's spokesman  told reporters today the executive branch would offer an explanation after Obama's formal announcement

He noted that since Obama's previous statements his legal advisers had indicated that there are some actions he can take unilaterally

The president also changed his calculus because House Republicans refused to pass comprehensive reforms, he said

At a press conference on Sunday Obama said he is able to reallocate resources and reprioritize deportation 'since we can’t do everything'
