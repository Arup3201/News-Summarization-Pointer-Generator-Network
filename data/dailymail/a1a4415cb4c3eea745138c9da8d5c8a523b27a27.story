Pensioners are being left in hospital beds for weeks on end because of a critical shortage of home helps and nursing home places

Thousands of older people are being left in hospital beds for weeks on end because of a critical shortage of home helps and nursing home places.

An international report found 'bed blocking' patients are stuck on wards unnecessarily for an average of 30 days – the highest level since the last election – putting their recovery at risk.

Campaigners said the 'bleak' study raises a fresh NHS scandal, on the heels of a meltdown in accident and emergency and out of hours care.

The problem in England's elderly care 
is highlighted in a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, which represents industrialised countries.

It
found that in January – the latest month for which figures were 
available – some 4,200 patients were kept unnecessarily in hospitals for
a total of 126,000 days.

That
works out at an average of 30 days per patient spent waiting to leave 
even though there was no clinical reason for them to be there.

Just
after the Coalition came to power, in August 2010, the average was 22 
days, according to the OECD. Hospitals are forced to keep such patients 
because they are too frail to be sent home on their own.

Campaigners say elderly people deteriorate if they are left in hospital, and also risk superbug infections.

They
say councils should provide home helps or free adaptations such as 
handrails to enable elderly people to leave hospital.

Alternatively, 
they should be put in a care home for a limited period until they are 
ready to go to their own house. Many town halls say they cannot afford 
to provide these services after recent cuts – forcing the NHS to step 
in.

The Daily Mail's Dignity For The 
Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted the plight of older people 
as local authorities increasingly restrict social care to those with 
'critical' or 'substantial' needs, and home care has been slashed – with
20,000 fewer people receiving support.

Delayed discharges have cost the cash-strapped health service around £260million since the election.

Michelle
Mitchell, from charity Age UK, said: 'This is not just a real waste of 
resources. Unnecessary and lengthy hospital stays can seriously 
undermine an older person's recovery.

'These figures are an insight into the increasingly bleak reality of the social care crisis where funding has failed to keep pace with demand.

'The steep rise in the length of time people are waiting ... suggests something has gone seriously wrong in the transition to home or residential care at a time when we know social care spending has fallen so dramatically.

'The care system urgently needs an injection of funds and a long-term commitment to sufficient resources.'

The OECD report, entitled A Good Life In Old Age, said delayed  discharges result from 'inadequate capacity in nursing homes or home-care services and support'.

It said: 'Waiting times are regarded as an indicator of poor access and a major challenge for delivering high-quality care services.

'Waiting may occur when older  people needing long-term care are discharged from acute care to a  more appropriate care setting such as community care and residential care for which there is a waiting list.

'This may lead to patients occupying acute care beds when no longer in need of acute care services.'
