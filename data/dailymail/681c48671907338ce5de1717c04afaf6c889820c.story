Mario Balotelli had every reason to celebrate after ending his goal drought for Liverpool against Swansea on Wednesday night, and went to popular city restaurant San Carlo to toast his success.

Balotelli, who has been heavily criticised for his performances since signing from AC Milan for £16million, was spotted leaving the swanky eatery with a friend on Wednesday night.

His goal against Swansea was laid on a plate for him and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will hope he still has some hunger for more despite this trip to the Italian.

Balotelli is never one to shy away from the cameras and stood out again on Wednesday evening as he was snapped wearing a black shiny waistcoat, snap back cap and high top trainers.

The 24-year-old forward has made a bit of a meal of it so far at Liverpool  but remains a big hit with the club's younger supporters and made one fan's day during the school half-term break.

Jack Gandy, 11, was picked out by Balotelli during a Liverpool training session, handing over a signed ball to the delighted youngster.

Balotelli wasn't finished there though as he called over Gandy for a photo beside his Ferrari as he left Melwood.

Gandy told the Liverpool Echo: 'He was dead friendly to talk to, I was dead proud and excited.'

Balotelli will be hoping he can now show that same kind of class on the field as he looks to add to the two goals he has scored to date in his Liverpool career and lift them up the table.
