The mangled remains of a bus block a Pakistan street after it was torn apart by a bomb today leaving 17 government workers dead and more than 40 injured.

Blood and body parts flew into the road when the device exploded at the back of the coach as it ferried government employees home in Peshawar city, to the north of the country.

The carnage was made worse by the fact that many of the victims were reportedly sitting on the roof of the bus as it travelled - a common practice in Pakistan.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the finger appears to point towards militants battling the government in the northwest of the country who often target troops, officials and symbols of the state.

Wrecked: Pakistani television showed images of the bus with its tail end completely mangled

The bomb went off as the bus was traveling through the outskirts of the city of Peshawar, the provincial capital. It was carrying employees at the end of the work week back to their home city of Charsadda.

The explosion also wounded 42 people, said police officer Arif Khan. Pakistani television showed images of the bus with its tail end completely mangled.

Terror: Militants in northern Pakistan who are trying to overthrow the government and establish a hard-line Islamic state have been waging war in the northwest against the military

Negotiations: Pakistan's newly elected government came into office in June with a promise to open negotiations with the militants to end years of conflict

Little comfort: The talks seem to have gone nowhere so far, and the militants have continued with attacks such as the one on Friday

One witness who was not identified told Pakistan's Geo Television channel that he was driving his car behind the bus when the blast ripped open the back end. He said dozens of people sitting on the roof of the bus - a common sight in this country's overcrowded traffic - were thrown to the side.

Pakistan's newly elected government came into office in June with a promise to open negotiations with the militants to end years of conflict.

But the talks seem to have gone nowhere so far, and the militants have continued with attacks such as the one on Friday.

Last Sunday, two suicide bombers attacked a church in Peshawar, killing dozens of Christians who were just finishing their service. Militants in northwestern Pakistan also killed a major general in the Pakistan Army earlier in September.
