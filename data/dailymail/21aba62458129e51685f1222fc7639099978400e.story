Gamers have slammed hackers who knocked out Playstation and Xbox networks on the  day millions received consoles for Christmas.

The online networks which allow game players to get the most out of their new machines went down yesterday, leaving many youngsters frustrated and parents furious.

Notorious hacking group Lizard Squad, who had previously brought down both networks earlier this month, claimed responsibility for the sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

As the disruption dragged on into a second day today, many desperate gamers sent messages to the group on Twitter, urging them to return service to normal.

And while Microsoft XBL is back up, PlayStation remains down for many. 

This as the hackers revealed in an interview with WinBeta 'that the task simply began for the laughs,' also adding that they felt 'it would anger and reach the largest amount of people – more people angry calls for a greater response from the companies.'

Theyv also claim to have stopped the attacks on the PlayStation Network, though it remains down.

Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service

Reasoning: Kim Dotcom (above) said he would provide them with with free, lifetime vouchers for his new MegaPrivacy website designed to provide encrypted cloud-storage if they stopped the attack

All over: The group said on Friday they had stopped the attack

Many had thought the systems would be restored when the hackers made a deal with the very eccentric millionaire entrepreneur and gamer Kim Dotcom, who told them he would provide them with with free, lifetime vouchers for his new MegaPrivacy website designed to provide encrypted cloud-storage.

And while Microsoft XBox was soon restored, PlayStation is not.

Dotcom also made it clear he would cancel the vouchers if they shut down the network again, which it is unclear if they did or if it is still having difficulty getting back up following the attack. 

Lizard Squad claimed they could take down the NASDAQ if they wanted and that they ‘jokingly refer to themselves as terrorists’.

They said that Microsoft was the easier of the two companies to take down as Sony had recently upgraded their systems.

Asked about what protections the Xbox network had, Lizard Squad said: ‘Almost nothing.' 

In one of hundreds of similar messages, Andrew Quintero wrote: 'Could you guys please let PSN back on?'

Others, such as London's Luca Rizzo, turned their anger on the companies, calling on them to improve security.

He wrote: '@XboxSupport when is online going to be back on? This is a joke were missing out on xmas gaming because of a hack! We want answers!'

Microsoft and Sony both used Twitter to acknowledge the issues and to assure users that they were doing everything they could to restore their services.

At 2:30pm this afternoon, the Playstation's network was offline and, while many Xbox Live services were up and running, the service's status was described as 'limited'.

On Boxing Day morning, Xbox support tweeted: 'Some Xbox One users may currently be experiencing issues signing into Xbox Live.'

Around the same time, Playstation's support team posted: 'Our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today. Thanks for your continued patience!'

Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch'

Rival hacker group, The Finest Squad, claimed via Twitter on Christmas Day that they had restored Xbox Live

The hack left gamers unable to play online and also impacted online components of hugely popular games such as Call of Duty, Madden, FIFA and The Sims 4.

Occasional downtime is par for the course for both services, but Christmas Day is a particularly bad time to be hacked, just as hundreds of thousands of PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones were being unwrapped and set up for the first time.

Lizard Squad had first announced earlier this month plans to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day. It described itself as the 'next generation Grinch.'

Another hacker group, The Finest Squad, then emerged, saying that it would stop the group and bring its members to justice. The Finest Squad tweeted at about 5pm ET that they had Xbox 'pretty much restored.'

The problems may have been exacerbated by Sony's decision to let consumers download the controversial movie The Interview through Xbox Video as well as other online sources.

Microsoft used Twitter on Christmas Day to keep gamers updated about the issues impacting on Xbox Live

There was anger on Twitter today as parents and youngsters expressed fury at not being able to use their expensive Christmas presents properly.

Wigan's Christine tweeted: 'Why hack Xbox & Playstation on Xmas day to stop kids playing with there presents....modern day Scrooge'

Another website user added: 'Can't believe people have nothing better to do on Xmas than to hack into Xbox Live and play station network and shut them down'

And IT tecnicial Jon Massey wrote: 'Cant figure out why they would hack Xbox + PSN. Way to spoil the Christmas for the kids who were lucky enough to get consoles...' 

Three Xbox platforms were affected by the service problem: Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Xbox on other devices, Microsoft's status website said.

'I have the nation on strings,' Lizard Squad wrote on its Twitter site. It also said it would put the sites back online if enough people retweeted its messages. 

Sony also used Twitter to keep PlayStation Network users abreast of the issues it was facing

Lizard Squad told WinBeta website it had taken down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live 'for the laughs' but eventually found a cause to rally behind - forcing those companies to upgrade the security on their networks.

Lizard Squad chose Christmas Eve and Christmas Day because it believed 'it would anger and reach the largest amount of people.' 

When asked if the group would consider addressing other targets, Lizard Squad said it 'could take down NASDAQ if they wanted to damage the economy,' but said that was not its goal. 

Lizard Squad said they would continue until the companies 'learned from their security issues.' 

In the past, Lizard Squad have overloaded both Microsoft and Sony's gameplay services, as well as Blizzard's online gaming network. 

Distributed denial-of-service attacks or DDoSing - occurs when massive numbers of people or automated machines flood servers with external data requests, crippling the computers to the point where they grind to a halt and are effectively frozen.

This is what happened when Lizard Squad attacked the Blizzard and PlayStation Network servers in August. 

It is unclear exactly who or what Lizard Squad are or what they are demanding.

The group communicates through Twitter - usually posting messages warning of upcoming attacks or flagging up current ones.

Various reports suggest that the group is based in Russia - although this has not been proved.

A link on the Lizard Squad Twitter page, leading to a chat room login - was originally Russian-based domain.
