The customized Captain America chopper Peter Fonda allegedly rode in Easy Rider has sold for $1.3 million despite claims that it is a fake.

Bidders rushed to snap up the Harley Davidson when went under the hammer in Calabasas, California, this week after auctioneers claimed it is the only remaining motorcycle built specifically for the film.

But the lucrative sale was sullied after Texan collector Gordon Granger claimed he owns the chopper used in the film, insisting he bought it from Dan Haggerty, an actor with a bit part in the 1960s counterculture classic.

Sold! This is the chopper that has sold for $1.3 million at auction in Calabasas despite claims it is a fake

'There's a big rat stinking someplace in this': Even the 74-year-old Oscar nominee, who wrote and starred in the 1960s classic, called on Profiles in History auction house to cancel the 'embarrassing' sale

The actor spoke out to quell the rumors, telling the Los Angeles Times that he has authenticated and sold two Captain America bikes - and the real one sold at the auction. 

The chopper features a forward-angled front wheel and handlebars, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank where the movie's protagonists stashed their cash. 

It was designed with input from the movie's writer and star Peter Fonda who insisted on it being decorated with the American flag.

Easy Rider is a 1969 road film about two drug-using, long-haired bikers, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), who go on a cross-country odyssey to New Orleans in search of personal freedom and easy money.

Four motorcycles were created for the movie, but only one is known to have survived. It was used in the climactic crash scene in which Fonda is thrown off the bike.

Fonda sketched the original design but doesn't want to take a side.

'I'm no expert, and I can't tell you which one is real,' he said. 'I know there are two bikes out there that are both authenticated by Haggerty. That's not right.' 

However he did authenticate the bike up for auction after a brief examination and even signed its gas tank.

The real deal? Actor Dan Haggerty, who had a bit-part in the movie, sits on the chopper he claims he rebuilt after its crash in the final scenes of 'Easy Rider'. He spoke out to quell rumors that it is a fake, insisting it is real

He says that until a few years ago when he learned to the other possible Captain America motorcycle he had no reason to doubt Haggerty's word. 

Now he regrets endorsing the bike.

'It's embarrassing, and infuriating,' he said.  

Earlier this week, he called on Profiles In History auction house to cancel the sale.

'There's a big rat stinking someplace in this,' said the 74-year-old actor, who co-wrote Easy Rider.  

The chopper's owner Michael Eisenberg, a Los Angeles real estate agent and collector of Hollywood memorabilia, bought the bike earlier this year from John Parham, a Midwestern motorcycle parts magnate who had purchased the bike from Haggerty 12 years earlier.

Fonda signed one Harley's gas tank before he knew that there was as controversy over authenticity

Conflict: Haggerty did not deny that he signed  authenticating documents for another chopper but now says he signed something inaccurate. Granger has refused to accept Haggerty's revelation and is sure his is real

Eisenberg insists his bike is the real one, because Haggerty says it is.

'Dan Haggerty is the only guy who knows,' Eisenberg said. 

Haggerty did not deny that he signed Granger's authenticating documents. He now says he signed something that simply was not true.

'That was my mistake,' Haggerty said. 'It's not the real bike.'

Granger, furious at the prospect of this weekend's auction, insists he owns the genuine article.

'They know damn well they don't have the real bike,' Granger said. 'I own the original remaining Captain America bike. The one to be auctioned is a replica.'
