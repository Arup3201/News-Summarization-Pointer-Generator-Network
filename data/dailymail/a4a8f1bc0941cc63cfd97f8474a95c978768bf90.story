President Barack Obama declared a mission-accomplished moment on Thursday while promising that the U.S. would continue to deliver airstrikes against the ISIS terror group whenever it threatens American interests.

He announced during a brief pre-golf speech that a U.S. military operation had 'almost flawlessly' helped tens of thousands of stranded Iraqi refugees reach safety following a harrowing week trapped on a remote mountainside.

But 'we will continue airstrikes,' he vowed, threatening ISIS as it continues its rape-and-pillage approach to regime change.

'We broke the [ISIS] seige of Mt. Sinjar,' he said, referring to the self-declared Islamic State group's reign of terror against the Yadizi religious minority group in Iraqi Kurdistan.

'We helped vulnerable people reach safety, and we helped save thousands of lives,' Obama told reporters.

There will be no more missions to help the Yazidis, he said, and 'the majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days.'

He terms the mission an 'assessment' because the role of military Special Forces was limited to little more than an aerial head-count.

Within hours of the deployment on Wednesday, a flyover mission confirmed that only around 5,000 Iraqi refugees remained, out of an estimated 45,000 who had sought safety on Mt. Sinjar.

The Department
 of Defense confirmed Wednesday evening that most of the Yazidi refugees had already taken
 themselves out of harm's way, in part because Kurdish Peshmerga 
fighters had cleared a path for them to leave safely.

The Pentagon also credited its own military attacks on ISIS targets, and humanitarian aid that helped sustain the people who were in harms' way.

Obama has been on vacation for the last six days, but the commander-in-chief looked more gray and haggard than ever as he delivered his update on Iraq and a statement about violence in Ferguson, Missouri.

He partied late into the evening yesterday at a birthday celebration for a longtime family friend, and danced to nearly every song, according to a White House pool report.

Tired as he may be, the president was back out on links immediately after his public address to play his fourth round of golf since he arrived in Martha's Vineyard on Saturday.

He said in his remarks Thursday that the U.S. had 'conducted humanitarian airdrops every night' since Friday, 'delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water.'

The military assessment on Wednesday, he confirmed, 'found that food and water had been reaching those in need, and that thousands ... had evacuated each and every night.

Rear
 Admiral John Kirby, a DOD spokesman, said Wednesday that 'there are far
 fewer Yazidis on Mt. Sinjar than previously feared, in part because of 
humanitarian air drops [and] air strikes on [ISIS] targets.'

The situation on the ground elsewhere in Iraq, however, 'remains dire,' said Obama.

He
 predicted that the U.S. would continue to provide humanitarian aid in 
other regions of the beseiged country, 'without committing troops on the
 ground.'

That pledge has raised eyebrows since Special Forces did in fact land on Mt. Sinjar. The White House has repeatedly framed 'boots on the ground' scenarios as only those that include armed battles with the Islamic State's militants.

Obama announced six days ago that he would authorize military airstrikes in northern Iraq  against the terror group's forces who were threatening as many as 45,000 Yazidis, a religious minority group whose people fled to the remote Mt. Sinjar â€“ and were left without food or water.

Following targeted airstrikes that launched just hours later, and after several days of humanitarian aid airlifts, Obama deployed 130 special forces personnel to the region on Wednesday with an eye toward organizing an evacuation.

SAS forces from the UK also participated in the deployment, which began less than a day after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told a group of more than 200 Marines at Camp Pendleton that 'there will be no boots on the ground in Iraq.'
