A time capsule hidden inside the walls of a California home in 1978 was finally reunited with its owner, who placed it there when he was only 12 years old. 

Robert Wright, 49, flew from Texas with his father to their former home in Fontana to pick up the 37-year-old time capsule that Wright once hid while his family was remodeling the house.

Inside he placed a signed note, a few coins, a newspaper cutting and a McDonald's scratch card. 

Robert Wright (pictured left as a 12-year-old and right today) was reunited with a time capsule he hid inside the walls of his home in 1978 

The 12-year-old Wright explained in the note that his dad was redoing the wall's paneling, which gave him the chance to hide the note away. He also provided 'proof' of the date with a newspaper clipping

In the note, Wright wrote: 'Hello to whoever finds this. My name is Robert Wright. Today my dad is putting up paneling. Today is November 18th, 1978, 15 till 12:00 noon'. 

'I'm 12 years old and a student at Fontana JR. High, 7th grade. I am 5'3, blond hair, hazel eyes.' 

'Here is proof of the date. Robert Wright.' 

Wright told ABC News it was 'surreal' to be reunited with the capsule he never thought he'd seen again.  

The capsule was a 'spur-of-the-moment idea', according to Wright, who quickly gathered some trinkets from his room before his dad sealed the interior wall he was redoing.

He tore off a newspaper and threw in the McDonald's ticket to prove the date.

The capsule wasn't unearthed until six years ago when Greg Sandoval, the home's current owner, was doing a renovation of his own.

Sandoval struggled to find Wright's contact information or profile on Facebook but didn't have the heart to throw it away.

The capsule wasn't unearthed until six years ago, when the home's current owner Greg Sandoval and his wife were doing a renovation of their own 

After six years he decided 'to do something about it' and reached out to his local ABC station in Los Angeles in December. 

The segment aired on a local ABC affiliate in Houston and Wright was soon inundated with phone calls.

He told ABC News: 'I watched the video link and was like, "Oh my gosh. This is me. I am that Robert Wright."'

Wright, who works in orthopedics in Austin, got in touch with Sandoval and decided he would personally pick up the capsule when he had to fly down to California in a few months for a conference.

The father-of-two now plans to continue the tradition with his boys, aged eight and nine, when they remodel their home this summer. 

'Maybe 50 years from now, someone will find their things,' Wright said. 'And they'll have a cool story to tell.'  

 Sandoval struggled to find Wright's contact information or profile on Facebook but he didn't have the heart to throw it away, so he contacted contacted his local ABC station - and Wright saw the segment
