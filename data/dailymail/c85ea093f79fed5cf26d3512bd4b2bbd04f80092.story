Georgiana Hibberd started out in the property industry almost 40 years ago, when everyday sexism was the norm. 

In the last four decades she has risen through the ranks to become Associate Director at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and says the workplace is almost unrecognisable.

She wrote about her experiences in a blog for the RICS, detailed here: 

'When I first started in the property business almost 40 years ago, things were very different for women. 

'The whole workplace was very different; behaviours that are today a sackable offence were treated as the norm.

'When I first decided I would like a job in an estate agency, a ‘secretary’ post seemed to be the only place I could start. These days I would be called a sales administrator, though the job is very much the same.

'Everyday sexism was the norm: I remember one day a male property surveyor (as they all were back then) whom I had never met before, came into the office, sat down in front of me, put his feet on my desk and, without so much as a hello, said ‘mine is a coffee, black no sugar’! 

'It was not a bad firm but in those days you just accepted that as a woman you were there to support the men. 

'You put up with having your bottom pinched or being groped at the office party and there was no point in taking umbrage if you wanted to keep your job.

'It soon became apparent to the boss that my typing was appalling, so I was made a junior estate agent but that was as far as my promotion prospects went. 

'I stayed with that particular firm, a good old fashioned partnership, for a couple of years, during which time a number of the male junior negotiators were promoted. 

'I was told women didn’t need proper jobs as they could rely on their husbands – and I had children so it would be too risky to promote me.

'I therefore decided I had to be better-qualified than the men if I was to be taken seriously in the business, and obtained a place on a property course.

'Three years later I graduated. 

'At that time, the most family friendly place to gain professional experience was in the public sector, so I applied. 

A meeting of female property surveyors in London in the late seventies 

'Getting an interview was difficult - there was one organisation where I was turned down because they thought I would have trouble ‘combining work with my family commitments’.

'My final interview was with the Civil Service, where I was offered a graduate post. 

'Even then there was some wage discrimination: a fellow male graduate, with the same degree, age and estate agency experience was offered a similar graduate position, but with a higher starting salary. 

'The office I started in had never had a female property valuer before and when I first arrived there was a big debate as to whether I should be excused from the ladies’ tea rota. 

'Fortunately the boss put his foot down and said I had better things to do than make tea.

'Inappropriate behaviour was common - in one office there was a colleague who was an out and out lech who thought nothing of ‘rubbing past’ as you stood at the photocopier; sometimes groping you at the same time. 

'Digging him in the ribs or getting annoyed only seemed to increase the pleasure it gave him, so you just avoided being cornered by him.

'Another colleague was also rather ‘hands on’ but not at all in the same way- he would always put his arm around females when explaining things to them. 

'He was mortified when I told him that being ‘hands on’ made women uncomfortable, I genuinely believe he didn’t realise how he made us feel or even that he was doing it.

In the sixties and seventies, women were often touched inappropriately by men in the workplace (picture posed by models) 

'When I went to value property, some members of the public would say to my face that they ‘were expecting a man’ and look concerned as I got on with the job.

'It was not all bad. Dealing a lot of the time with inheritance tax, I used to particularly like negotiating with the gentlemanly land agents who treated me like a lady. 

'I had some easy negotiations and think with hindsight they may have been slightly charmed dealing with a woman. Sexism can be double-edged.

'The women’s world of work has changed exponentially for the better over the last 40 years. 

'However, I don’t think you can judge history against the standards of today; I just look back on it as if I was involved in a period drama, or maybe a comedy.'
