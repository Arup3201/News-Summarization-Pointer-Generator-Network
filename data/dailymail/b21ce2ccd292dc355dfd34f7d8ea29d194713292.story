Justin Bieber had his pet monkey confiscated as he flew into Germany without the necessary documentation

Justin Bieber’s abandoned monkey Mally is now officially the property of the German state and has been moved to a secret location to protect it from paparazzi photographers and fans wanting to adopt him.

The Canadian teen idol let the deadline pass on Friday to collect the capuchin monkey impounded back in March when he jetted into Europe for his tour without the correct paperwork.

Karl-Heinz Joachim, at the Munich animal
 clinic where Mally was being cared for until the Friday deadline, said;
 'We have heard nothing more from Bieber’s management so we are moving 
forward on the presumption that the animal will stay in Germany long 
term.

'Friday was the deadline day and we have not heard a thing.

'Mally will undergo another medical examination next week and then decisions will have to be made about where he goes.

'I think we can safely say now that he is not returning to the states.'

Germany’s famous Serengeti Park in the state of Lower Saxony is among the wild animal places offering Mally a permanent home.

Managing
 director Fabrizio Sepe has a good reputation in Germany and a group of 
capuchin monkeys that Mally might be able to live with.

He said; 'We have an intact family of capuchin monkeys. It would be great if the monkey baby Mally could grow up with them.'

Dr Florian Brandes, an animal beahvioural expert, said it is imperative that Mally gets into a group of his own kind as soon as possible.

He said; 'The monkey should be accommodated swiftly among his own kind. He is at grave risk of psychological problems in the future if this is not achieved.'

A government conservation office in Bonn will have to ultimately decide who gets to rear Mally and how.

The Canadian pop star performed in Berlin on March 31. He now owes thousands of euros for the care of his abandoned pet

Capuchin monkeys are a sociable breed. It is paramount that Mally is introduced to other monkeys after being in isolation for the last two months

The Federal Office for Nature Conservation will not divulge where Mally has been removed to. 

Office spokesman Franz Emde said; 'There are several zoos that want Mally. The main prerequisite is that there other capuchin monkeys that will accept him.'

It is not yet clear whether Bieber will have to pay a fine of several thousands of euros plus care costs for Mally because there is no agreement with the relevant wild animal authorities in the United States, said department head Dietrich Jelden.
