She's the heir to iconic brand Quality Street but with wedding preparations well under way, Millie Mackintosh won't be dipping her fingers into a box of the chocolates any time soon.

She's embarking on a strict sugar-free diet to ensure that she is in top shape ahead of her big day.

The glamorous Made In Chelsea star has begun a six-week sugar detox course with expert nutritionist, Madeleine Shaw.

Sugar ban: Millie Mackintosh, who recently announced her engagement to Professor Green, is embarking on a sugar-free detox

Millie, 23, who announced her 
engagement to pop star Professor Green last month, has signed up for one-on-one 
coaching with guru Madeleine.

Madeleine believes natural, fresh wholefoods are what you should eat to truly nourish your body and she promises to help serial sugar obsessives give up the sweet stuff for good.

Chelsea girl Millie tweeted her excitement at starting the course.

She wrote: 'Starting my 6 week detox with @madeleine_shaw_ she's helping me to quit sugar! super excited.'

Madeleine even paid a visit to Millie's house and gave her fridge a healthy revamp.

'On a scale of one to ten, how bad is my fridge?' asked Millie.

'Not that bad, I was expecting worse,' replied Madeleine, who scolded Millie for the beer and bagels in her fridge.

The duo headed out shopping and returned stocked up with plenty of colourful fruits and vegetables, coconut water, seeds and low-fat yoghurt.

Madeleine then cooked a super healthy vegetable soup for Millie using all fresh ingredients, which Millie loved.

Madeleine's website states: 'I run a six week programme that will easily draw you off sugar allowing you to live a free existence.

Tasty? Millie sampled the healthy soup, and seemed to approve. Will she whip it up for Pro Green too?

'You will be taken on a journey that will detox, revitalise and energise your body from inside out.

'You will be fully supported, loaded with delicious recipes and insider tips, and with all consultations done over Skype we can schedule them in at a time that best suits you!'

For those following her regime like Millie, Madeleine suggests healthy yet wholesome recipes such as creamy scrambled eggs with asparagus for breakfast, quinoa, asparagus and pea salad for lunch and slow roast pork with red cabbage and apple for dinner.

Madeleine adds: 'My intentions are to make brilliant, healthful food that tastes as amazing as it’s glorious nutritional value. I design scrumptious, original recipes that are easy to prepare without a professional chef on standby!

'It will inspire you to fall back in love with life and yourself.'
