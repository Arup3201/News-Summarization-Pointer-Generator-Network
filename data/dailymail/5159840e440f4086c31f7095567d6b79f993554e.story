Police dogs have been fitted with state-of-the-art cameras so they can record themselves apprehending criminals.

The technology also allows officers to check out a building from the dogs' perspective to make sure it is safe before they enter it themselves.

Police met at the Durham and Cleveland firearms training centre near Darlington to test the new body K9cams on their animals.

Training: An officer puts the camera through its paces at the Durham and Cleveland firearms training centre

Missions: The technology allows police to film inside buildings without putting themselves at risk by entering

The cameras are strapped to the dogs' torsos, and record every moment they are on duty.

As well as providing video which can be played back later and used as a record of missions, the devices can beam back live video to officers.

Durham Police have been working with manufacturer Tactical Electronics UK since January last year to develop the more practical cameras to help in police searchers and other serious incidents.

The result was the ARK, an armed response kit comprising the back-mounted K9cam, a long-pole camera with a 20ft reach, and monitors so handlers and tactical advisors can see the images.

Development: The camera and associated devices were invented by Tactical Electronics UK

Handler: An officer poses with his dog wearing the K9cam at the training centre this week

Comfortable: The dogs are accustomed to the back-mounted camera than a head-mounted one

The gear has already been used at a number of firearms and other high-risk incidents in the North-East.

Dave Robinson, one of the force's dog handlers, said that the equipment
was a great improvement on the head-mounted cameras they used to put on
the dogs.

'This camera
- as opposed to the last camera - is mounted on the dog's back,' he 
said. 'And because dogs when they're tracking or searching normally wear
a harness anyway, they're very, very comfortable with something being 
on their back.

'Whereas
a head-mounted unit, although it was very good, it was a big ask of a 
dog to wear it for a long period of time without interfering with it.'

Dry run: This video footage is broadcast live to the dog's handler and other officers on standby

Suspect: The police dog apprehending a dummy made to look like a potential criminal

Inspector Russ Robson added: 'This is something that is readily available so it is part of our armed response vehicle, so if there's a firearms job or a high-risk person missing from home, we do not need to have it brought to us.

'It fits on the body of the dog, rather than the headcams we had before, where we had to use quite a mature dog.

'It also means we don't have to put up cordons, empty houses and close of roads.

'We have the public, officers and other emergency services who we must safeguard first and we can send them in and clear the area.

'The dog that we have got have all taken to it and there's been no adverse reactions to it - it's light and on a harness that they wear, so the dogs have seen some benefit.'

Useful: The device could obviate the need to cordon off roads and police animals are sent in first

Experiment: The tests pictured here took place at the training centre near Darlington in County Durham
