A New Jersey amusement park that was as famous for the many lawsuits brought against it as it was for its rides, with no fewer than six people losing their lives there and 110 people reported injuries in a single year.

Since it closed in 1996, Action Park became the stuff of urban legend and nostalgia, even inspiring a documentary called 'The Most Insane Amusement Park Ever.'

And as of June 14, Action Park is back, complete with a new attraction, the Zero G, which drops riders through a trapdoor and down a 100-foot-high slide, which Action Park's owners says is the tallest of its kind.

Notorious: The 'most insane amusement park ever,' Action Park is back in, well, action

Nostalgia: Children of the 1980s and '90s remember Action Park with equal parts fondness and fear

'At Action Park, it felt like you were in some crazy guy’s backyard,' Dave Schlussman, a 30-year-old from Greenpoint, told the New York Post.

'The rides defied any kind of procedure.'

The rural resort drew thousands of revelers everyday from 1978 until 1996 in spite of - or maybe because of - its freewheeling reputation for danger.

'We'd race some unsuspecting guy on the Alpine Slide,' said Dana Bornstein, 44, who worked at the park as a teenager in the 1980s.

'We'd be at the bottom and see the cart come down by itself. Next thing you know, they'd be bringing the guy to first aid.'

Bornstein was one of roughly 100 former employees who gathered for a reunion at the legendary water park on Saturday to celebrate its rechristening.

Action Park closed in 1996 and reopened two years later as Mountain Creek. Owners decided to switch back to the original name in an attempt to capitalize on the nostalgia - some might say notoriety - of its earlier heyday.

One of the first waterparks in the country, Action Park opened in 1978, sometimes introducing new attractions almost as soon they were invented.

'Pretty much any backyard inventor with a crazy idea knew this was the place to try it out,' said Bill Benneyan, president of Mountain Creek Resort, which owns Action Park.

One such ride was only in action for a month before it was shut down. The Cannonball Loop was a water slide with a 360-degree loop at the end.

A man who claims his father built the slide told Buzzfeed that stories about dismembered crash-test dummies are completely true.

'The story about the dummies is completely true! They used the dummies to test several of the rides at the park and every time a dummy came off the ride dismembered they would try it again until it stayed in one piece, then they would pay someone to test it!' he said.

Matt Weismantel, who worked at the park from 1979 to 1984 recounted watching operators turn on the wave pool (also known as the 'grave pool', at the time one of the first in the country, for the first time. He heard a scream and saw a woman clinging to the side of the wall, her feet above the water.

'She didn't realize that when the wave went through, there'd be nothing underneath her,' Weismantel said.

The park earned a reputation for danger and six people died there from 1980 to 1987.

News accounts from the New Jersey Herald in the 1980s reported hundreds of lawsuits in little more than a few years. The Alpine Slide was the site of 26 head injuries and 14 fractures in a two-year period.

Executives at the newly renamed Action Park hope they can resurrect that reputation for risk without the actual danger. The Alpine Slide and a seldom-used waterslide known as the Cannonball Loop have been removed.

In a tour of the park on Saturday, Benneyan stressed that the state inspects rides at the beginning and end of the season, plus conducts periodic checks during the season.

Some of the former employees expressed a sense of nostalgia for a time when kids and teenagers roamed free and a little bit of danger was associated with growing up.

'When you are the first to do something, you do it without regulation,' said Amy Rude, 39, who worked at the park from 1990 to 1995. 'Action Park is from a moment in time that can never happen again.'

Former park employee Mike Donahan, 40, remembers seeing wipeouts on the Alpine Slide that left kids with scrapes severe enough to require a trip to the first-aid office but not immobilizing enough to keep them from soon returning to the same ride.

'They'd be bleeding and jump right into the pools,' he said. 'I don't even know how much chlorine they put in the pool.'
