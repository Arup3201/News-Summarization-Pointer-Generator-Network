It’s the race that stops the nation but this year it's even stopped many people from over spending to avoid that spring racing financial hangover ahead of the Melbourne Cup.

A survey commissioned by ME Bank has found 70.6 percent of Australians won’t spend money on a new outfit this year, while 55 percent are expected to spend the same amount as last year.

The spring carnival season usually come at a price and some race goers may be heading for trouble with 55 percent saying they will spend their disposable income, according to the report.

But Emily Rose Bovill, from South Yarra, Victoria told Daily Mail Australia that she won’t be splurging for her favourite time of the year, despite spending around $1500 on outfits alone in previous years.

Before moving out of her parents' home, the 27-year-old said she has been an avid race goer since the age of 16.

But with the spring racing carnival already in full swing, the business analyst said she will only make one appearance this year. 

The Melbourne resident said she usually spends between $1000 to $1500 on outfits alone each year, and an extra $150 to $250 for a race ticket, which includes entry, food and beverage. 

‘What I love most about the races is frocking up and the social aspect of the carnival where I get to spend the day with my friends,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Now that I’m living independently, I’ve become more conscious of spending extravagantly because I’m also trying to save for an overseas trip to Vietnam next year.

‘I don’t feel bad about making a cut back but it’s just a different priority now and it’s been a great experience.

'And I'll even be able to spend my money on things I like doing instead of things I like wearing so I don't feel bad about scaling back at all - I've been able to prioritise what's more important to me.' 

While seven percent of Australians are ‘counting on luck’ and planning to use their winnings to fund the day, Ms Bovill said gambling is not a ‘highlight’ of her day.

‘Gambling isn’t my thing and I focus more on spending time with my friends and having a really lovely day,’ she said.

The survey found 22 percent are expecting to spend more this year, while 13 percent said they don't yet know how they'll pay for it.

The most common expenses for Australian race goers are betting, champagne and catering but looking stylish by the tracks is more important to Ms Bovill.

‘Usually, I would over splurge and spend around $1500, which covers three different and complete outfits, including dresses, shoes and accessories for a three-day event,' she said.

‘But this year, I’ve looked at other options to save and I will only attend Stakes Day this year.

‘I managed to purchase an entire outfit, including a dress and accessories for $500 from a large Melbourne department store during the mid-season sale.'
