A pioneering takeaway boss has created the ultimate nightcap for punters who want to continue the night long after last orders – battered booze.

Northerner John Clarkson, who runs Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Ribbleton, near Preston, Lancashire, is selling deep fried ‘shots’ alongside the more traditional meal of fish and chips.

He decided to combine alcohol with food so customers could ‘get full and merry at the same time’.

Hot shots: John Clarkson of Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire, has created the ultimate post pub snack - battered booze. Each 'hot shot' contains one measure of alcohol

The sponge inside the 'shots' is soaked in alcohol and comes in a range of flavours including Baileys, Apple Sourz, Tequila, Disaronno, vodka and cola, Malibu and Jagermeister

And he says the £3 'hot shots', which consist of a sponge mixture combined with either Baileys, Apple Sourz, Tequila, Disaronno, Vodka, Malibu or Jagermeister, are a hit.

He said: ‘Once you’ve had one, you just want another. I suppose it’s the same as when people say they’re just going for one pint.’

Mr Clarkson, 54, who has hit headlines in the past for creating the deep-friend mince pie and Ferrero Rochers, said the ‘shots’ were particularly tricky to make because the alcohol disperses during the cooking process.

So he teamed up with wife Corrine, 39, who took inspiration from a popular British dessert – the sherry trifle.

Kebab: Mr Clarkson has created a variation of the traditional kebab at his takeaway in Preston, Lancashire - an alcohol 'shot' which combines deep fried sponge with booze

Using the sponge mixture from the trifle combined with lashings of booze, Mr Clarkson was able to deep-fry the mixture so the alcohol keeps its original kick.

Each portion is a standard shot glass measure and Mr Clarkson asks customers to bring their own alcohol as the chippy does not have a licence to sell booze.

He said: ‘Whatever they want, we make it. No-one has done deep-fried alcohol before, but I’ve well and truly given it my best shot.’
