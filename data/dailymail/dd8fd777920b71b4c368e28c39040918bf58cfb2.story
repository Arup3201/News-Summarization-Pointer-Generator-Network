Set amid its own apple and cherry orchards, and with an impressive six bedrooms complete with period features, by anyone's standard this Grade II farmhouse is a bargain at just  £395,000.

There is just one small drawback - the view.

Hunts Copse Farm, in South Marston, Wiltshire, was once the centre of a 370-acre farmstead. Now  it is surrounded by a sprawling industrial estate.

This stunning six-bedroom farmhouse complete with an orchard and impressive period features is on the market for just £395,000 - because it is in an industrial estate

But the property, which also boasts landscaped gardens and a lake.was requisitioned, by the Government at the start of the Second World War and an aircraft factory was built in the grounds.

Next came a Honda factory, an industrial estate and then a B&Q national distribution centre the size of 20 football pitches - one of the biggest buildings in the UK.

Experts say if the stunning stone-built farmhouse was set in a village it would easily fetch in excess of £1.5million when it goes to auction next month.

But despite the unusual neighbours, surveyor Andrew Stibbard reckons new owners could ignore the industrial surroundings and live the life of a cut-price farmer.

'It's surprisingly quiet here on a weekday, and at the weekend you'd have the place to yourself,' said Mr Stibbard, who is marketing the property for high-end estate agents Moore, Allen and Innocent.

In a village setting, this farmhouse would set you back £1.5 million-plus. Where else are you going to pick up a six-bedroom period house for £395,000?'

The enormous L-shaped home has wood panelled entrance halls and flagstone floors leading to three impressive reception rooms, boasting huge authentic fireplaces and huge sash windows.

The farmhouse was converted into plush offices but has planning permission to become a boutique hotel, and consent pending to turn it back into a family home.

It still has two-acres of private land behind a five-bar gated entrance, and a further acre of land enclosing a lake which will be auctioned as a separate lot.

Mr Stibbard added: 'On the first floor are six bedrooms, including a well-proportioned master bedroom with large sash windows and period fireplace. On the second floor is an attic.

'I can see this property appealing to a small business looking for office accommodation in a historic building with interesting features, or a hotelier, but equally I can see the appeal to a large family that requires lots of rooms and space, both indoors and out.'

`Viewing events have been scheduled for July 30 and August 6 and 13 between 4pm and 5.30pm.

In 2009 estate agents ran into trouble after failing to mention in their sales pitch for an idyllic cottage, that it sat next to a nuclear power station.

West Beach Cottage on the Dungeness Nature Reserve in Kent, which is yards from two nuclear power stations

The cottage on the Dungeness National Nature Reserve comes complete with period features, double glazing and gas-fired central heating, and boasts half an acre of land.

Described by estate agents as a 'property not to be missed', they rather absent-mindedly omitted to inform prospective buyers the three-bedroom home was a stone's throw from the looming presence of the Dungeness A and B power plants.
