It is the mobile phone you can use in the bath or shower without fear - and can even survive being dropped down the toilet.

Sony has unveiled its latest mobile phone - and hopes the waterproof design will help it take on the iPhone.

The Xperia Z was unveiled at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas.

Sony says the handset, which has a 5in (12.7cm) screen, is capable of being submerged in water of up to one metre (3.3 ft) in depth for 30 minutes.

The firm says it can survive being dropped in a toilet, and if it gets dirty, can simply be washed under a tap.

Sony claims that about one in 10 people had dropped their phone down a toilet at some point, something this would protect against.The trade-off is that handset's various ports, including the one for its headphones, all feature protective plastic covers that must be unclipped before they can be accessed.

The handset also has an NFC chip allowing owners to play back video on their TV simply by tapping the phone against it.

This chip could also be used as a credit card in the future, it is believed.

MailOnline tried the new waterproof handset

The Sony Xperia Z, out in the next few weeks, is a mobile phone with a 5in screen.

Apart from the Samsung Galaxy Note devices which are part-phone, part tablet, this is the biggest-screen phone yet.

Even so, because it’s slim and has the narrowest of bezels round the display, it didn’t feel big. Though it sure didn’t feel small.

The phone’s display has the highest resolution yet seen on a mobile – knocking the iPhone’s Retina display for six.

The 5in screen had as many pixels as a 55in Full HD flatscreen TV, and it showed.

The display was eye-poppingly sharp, with rich colours.

Since the phone has a quad-core processor, it’s fast and responsive with no lags or stutters.

This looks like it could be a real challenger to the current market leaders, the Samsung Galaxy S III and the Apple iPhone 5.

It felt great, thanks to a shatterproof glass back and exceptional build quality.

Other features included a high-resolution 13-megapixel camera and – handy if you tend to drop your phone in the bath – water resistance. It can be immersed in two feet of water for 30 minutes without harm.

Stuart Miles, Editor-in-chief of tech website Pocket-lint.com told MailOnline: 'The Sony Xperia Z has so many features and so much going for it, 
it really could be the phone to restore Sony Mobile’s fortunes.

'It’s 
probably the company’s best phone yet.'

'With Xperia Z, we are bringing over 
half a century of innovation in TV, imaging, music, film and gaming to 
create a superphone experience that truly stands out,' said Kuni Suzuki,
 President and CEO, at Sony Mobile Communications.

'With great specifications, Sony’s 
media applications, One-touch functions and outstanding battery life, 
Xperia Z is well positioned for leadership in the smartphone market.

'By
 putting smartphones at the heart of our strategy, Sony is enabling 
people to create, enjoy and share content and experiences like never 
before.

However, analysts has the firm has a tough battle, with both Apple and Samsung set to reveal new handset in the coming months.

'In
 isolation this looks like a very strong product and it's the most 
attractive Xperia phone that I have seen for a very long time," said Ben
 Wood of CCS Insights.
