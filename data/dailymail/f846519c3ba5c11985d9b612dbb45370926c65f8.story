The BBC has been accused of 'extraordinary' censorship by a leading playwright after dialogue was cut from her hard-hitting drama in case it offended Muslims.

Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, whose 2004 play Behzti was pulled from a Birmingham theatre after it sparked Sikh protests, says the Corporation tampered with her work because it involved an honour killing.

Ms Bhatti was commissioned by Radio 4 to write an episode of its police drama Stone.

Her episode, The Heart of Darkness, will be broadcast this Friday, but she says the BBC has caused an 'awful situation' which has led to a 'betrayal' of her work.

Controversial: Her episode of DCI Stone, starring Hugo Speer, is on Radio 4 on Friday but is missing key lines, she says, because of 'fear'

At the centre of her story is the honour killing of a 16-year-old 
Asian girl, and DCI Stone is told by his bosses to treat the case 'sensitively' because she is Muslim.

Although they have admitted removing dialogue from the afternoon drama, the BBC claims they did it to avoid 'potentially misrepresenting majority British Muslim attitudes to honour killing'.

Describing the play's final line, Ms Bhatti told a conference called Taking the Offensive, organised by Index on Censorship: 'At the end, a 
  character says: "There is so much pressure in our community to look right 
  and to behave right." The compliance department came back and said, "We 
  don’t want to suggest the entire Muslim community condones honour killings".

'It's a crucial part of that story. I was very disappointed given my previous experience of censorship. If you take out the line, the whole thing changes, it's a betrayal of the character and the truth of the unfolding story.

'It’s an extraordinary and awful situation. They said the 
  lines were offensive but they absolutely were not. We live in a fear-ridden 
  culture.'

Bhatti, who also writes The Archers, was forced into hiding in 2004 after her play Behzti caused a storm.

It included a scene in a Gurdwara, a Sikh temple, which involved rape, physical abuse and murder. But the play did win her awards.

That year she received death threats, including a Christmas card that read: 'Seasons Greetings. This will be your last Christmas. You are a disgrace to the race. Sending you lots of hate.'

The BBC said today the radio drama to be played on Friday was treated no differently than any other.

'This is a hard-hitting drama about 
the realities of honour killing in Britain. A single line in the script 
could be taken to infer that the pressure and motivation to commit such a
 crime in a family comes from the wider Muslim community, potentially 
misrepresenting majority British Muslim attitudes to honour killing,' a Radio 4 spokesman said.

'Gupreet Kaur Bhatti was asked to amend this line in the normal editorial
 process of script development.'
