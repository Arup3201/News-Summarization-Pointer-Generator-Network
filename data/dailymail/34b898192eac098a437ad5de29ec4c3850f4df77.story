Selfridges was under fire today for giving an English Defence League leader and his friend a free lunch worth £83 after a sales assistant refused to serve them.

Tommy Robinson was at the high-end store on London's Oxford Street on Monday accompanying a friend who wanted to buy a pair of jeans when a member of staff allegedly told his friend 'F*** off, I'm not serving you.'

The sales assistant is said to have sworn at Robinson's friend after querying whether he was with the leader of the far-right group.Scroll down for video

When Robinson, 30, and his friend 
complained to management, they were given a free £83 lunch at the 
store's in-house Hix Restaurant, Champagne and Caviar Bar.

Robinson videoed the confrontation at the sales desk and posted the footage on YouTube.

EDL leader Tommy Robinson was given a free lunch at Selfridges after a member of staff swore at his friend while they were shopping there

In it, he is heard remonstrating with one particular member of staff, whom he identified as a Muslim.

With his hands in the air, the sales assistant is seen to shrug, saying: 'I'm not serving you, I'm not serving you.'

Robinson,
 who is due to stand trial next month for 'obstructing police' during a 
march near where drummer Lee Rigby was slain in May this year, is heard 
to ask him: 'So you won't serve my friend because he's friends with me 
and I'm in the EDL?'

He adds: 'He's nothing to do with me, and I've just gone and bought stuff over there.'

A female member of staff then tells 
Robinson that someone from the store's management team was coming to 
sort the dispute out, before a large security guards intervenes and 
makes Robinson stop filming.

The assistant was later sent home, while managers at the shop gave Robinson and his friend a free lunch to say sorry.

Later
 Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, tweeted 'Today a 
Muslim in Selfridges told my mate to f*** off and refused to serve him 
simply cos he was with me', with a link to the YouTube camera footage.

He
 then tweeted pictures of them both enjoying a three-course lunch at Hix
 with the caption: 'Complimentary lunch, manager's a top lad, couldn't 
be more apologetic.'

He posted pictures of his tattooed friend sitting at a table laden with prawn cocktail (£11.25), steak and chip with bearnaise sauce (£25), and chocolate cake with ice cream (£5.25), commenting 'I can't lie, staff at Selfridges have been brilliant #fatlads'

Steak and chips with bearnaise sauce (£25)

Chocolate cake with ice cream (£5.25)

TOTAL BILL FOR TWO: £83

Today, however, the historic department store was criticised for giving Robinson, who has assault, drug and public order convictions, a slap-up lunch.

Shoppers took to Twitter to condemn the store, with many tweeting 'Shame on you'.

Nabil Hanafi tweeted: 'Selfridges are a disgrace. Harvey Nicks for my Xmas shopping this year', while Kaz Price said: 'Thank you for keeping the employee!  I can now continue to shop at your store!'

This afternoon a spokesman for Selfridges, which initially suspended the sales assistant but then reinstated him, told MailOnline: 'Since 1909 we have welcomed everyone to our store and have endeavoured to provide a world-class service.

'We have now completed our  internal investigation with our long term sales associate, who was involved in the EDL issue, and he will be back at work in due course.'
