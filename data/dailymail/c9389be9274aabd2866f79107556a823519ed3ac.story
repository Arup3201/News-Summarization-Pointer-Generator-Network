As the fashion world descends onto the French capital again it seems designers' creativity has gone sky high.

American designer Thom Browne’s collection had distinctive aviation and military themes, with male models strutting down the runway in pilot caps and aviator sunglasses.

Strong military trench coats swept the floor as high-shine army regulation style boots stomped down the catwalk.

Aviators, caps and a lot of red lipstick were the order of the day at Pret a Porter Men's spring/summer 14 shows in Paris

There were white pilot gloves paired with army parade plumes on Tom Browne's catwalk

The collection took inspiration from across the armed forces, with white pilot gloves paired with army parade plumes emerging from captain's hats, and navy anchors embroidered on many pieces.

A heavily monochrome colour palette was brightened with a slew of fire engine-red coats and mirrored aviators were a key accessory throughout.

Thom's specialty is distinctively structured suits with exposed ankles in a range of charcoal-grey colors

Thom Browne is the founder and head of design for his eponymous New York City-based menswear and womenswear brand.

His first womenswear collection was debuted in the early 2000s and he was named the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Menswear Designer of the Year in March 2006 as well as being named the GQ Designer of the Year in November 2008.

His menswear line was established, he claims, as a response to the general acceptance of business casual designs in lieu of formal attire.

His specialty is distinctively structured suits with exposed ankles in a range of charcoal-grey colors.

Since its début in 2001, the collection 
has expanded into a more complete menswear line with dress shirts, 
sweaters, ties, underwear, and accessories.

There were also designs from Miharayasushiro, Raf Simons and Walter Van Beirendonck in Paris

Walter Van Beirendonck sent models in casual and colourful suits down the runway, whilst Kris Van Assche put a modern spin on the anorak

Yohji Yamamoto opted for all things bright and beautiful and Walter Van Beirendonck even dyed his model's hair a shimmering gold hue

Monochrome shorts, high collars and vibrant oranges and yellows were key themes on the catwalk in Paris

The suited influence was strong throughout the shows yesterday with the likes of Miharayasushiro, Raf Simons and Walter Van Beirendonck sending their models down the catwalk in a variety of smart jackets and trousers.

Key colour palettes were vibrant orange and yellow as well as the more muted and classic monochrome.

One key trend that emerged was tailored suit trousers with cropped ankles, as well as high peter pan style collars.

Other top designers presenting their collections at this year's Paris Prêt-à-Porter Fashion Week include Balenciaga, Chanel, Barbara Bui, Christian Dior, Maison Martin Margiela, Chloe, Valentino, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu and Elie Saab.

Cropped ankles are most certainly in for this season if Wooyoungmi and Kris Van Assche's offerings are anything to go by

Intricate prints were present on shirts, jackets and suits at Paris Pret a Porter s/s 14 shows
