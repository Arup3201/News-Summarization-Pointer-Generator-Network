A local council has been left red-faced after photographs surfaced of a woeful attempt at drawing line markings on a Brisbane road.

In the photo posted on social media by a resident of the Moreton Bay Regional Council (MBRC) area shows a white line marking painted over the top of a pile of leaves and bark.

The picture was snapped on Mount Nebo Road, which is located north-west of Brisbane, Westside News reported.

The botched line job was sighted along Mt Nebo Road, which is north-west of Brisbane in Queensland 

Along with it, the resident wrote a caption that said: 'Nice one MBRC'.

The post immediately garnered a response from local councillor Bob Millar.

The Division 11 representative, whose ward covers the Mount Nebo region, said he was sitting with the director of engineering construction and maintenance whose response Cr Millar would not repeat.

He explained the council hired a contractor to do the line markings and director Tony Martini was speaking with the contractor who completed the job as he wrote.

Cr Millar said the first reaction he had when he saw the photo was 'Well that's interesting'.

'The section of road, over which approximately five metres of roadside vegetation litter was "painted" ,was part of a 15-kilometre line marking project being undertaken during the off-peak night time,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

He also told Quest Newspapers 'it’s not beyond the bounds of possibility that in the darkness the operator for the company contracted to council has missed it'. 

The company would now redo the botched job after the matter was raised with the contractor by the council's project manager. 

'I was disappointed, the director was disappointed, the project manager was disappointed and so was the owner of the contractor,' Cr Millar said.
