What are you to do with when all the limos are booked up on your prom night?

For best friends Chloe Webb and Lauren Huggett, the answer was to take a £500 helicopter ride instead.

Looking more like celebrities than schoolgirls, the 16-year-olds upped the glamour stakes by flying to their end-of-year party just eight miles from where they live.

In a scene more akin to the US high school prom-craze, the two girls touched down outside the venue and stepped out in their ballgowns wowing their shocked school friends.

The pair had hoped to get a limo for their trip to the prom at the Whitminster Inn, Gloucestershire and were disappointed to discover they were all fully booked.

But they certainly weren’t disappointed for long.

Lauren’s dad Jason Huggett stepped in to help, and arranged for the girls to be glamorously dropped off to the prom by helicopter instead - and also went along for the ride.

The girls were picked up in the Robinson R44 twin-engine chopper at Cashes Green playing field in Stroud and treated to a half-hour ride before surprising their friends when the chopper made its landing at the venue.

Chloe said: 'It was a fantastic trip - really good fun. We got in the helicopter and flew around for half-an-hour before being dropped off at our prom.

'All our friends were really shocked - they could not believe it.

It was a very glamorous entrance for the girls, more akin to the US-style prom craze

Dressed in their ballgowns, the girls shocked their friends when they made their arrival at the venue in a helicopter

'We landed on a patch of grass right next to the tent where our prom was taking place in.

'We had wanted to get a limousine to the venue but they had all gone by the time we went to book it - but this was even better.

'The prom was brilliant too.'

For Chloe the prom marked the end of her time at Archway School in Stroud.

She now plans to study beauty therapy at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, while Lauren, from Cashes Green will stay on to study in Archway’s sixth-form department.

The girls may have been inspired from the blinging ways of across the pond, where extravagant high school proms are treated as a rite of passage.

The girls, who were also joined by Lauren's dad, Jason Huggett, enjoyed a 30 minute ride before being dropped off

Thanks to shows such as My Super Sweet 16 and films like High School Musical, the US-style proms have been increasingly on the rise in Britain.

Parents are being persuaded to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds on dresses, hair, spray tans, tiaras and limos as US-style proms take hold in Britain.

Last week Amy Powell, aged 16, from Billericay, Essex, confessed that her parents Dee, 51, and Phil, 52, spent a staggering £799 on styling their daughter head-to-toe and waving her off in a limo.

She said: ‘Of course on the day, people will be judging everyone else’s look. With that many girls, and that many spray tans and big hair, there will be bitchiness.

‘Even now, everyone is keeping their dress secret as they’re so paranoid that someone will copy them — and they want to keep it as a surprise for their big entrance.’
