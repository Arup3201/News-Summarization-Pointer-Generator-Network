Carol Vorderman has insisted there should be more female pilots.

The TV presenter is backing a campaign by British Airways called the Future Pilot Programme which is a training scheme aimed at recruiting new pilots.

However, the 53-year-old former Countdown host, who qualified to become a pilot in 2013, said that there are currently too few women training to enter the industry.

She is also hoping that her own experience can inspire more women to begin training.

Ms Vorderman, who is planning to fly solo around-the-world next year following in the flight path of British pioneer aviator Mildred Bruce, said: ‘I always wanted to be a pilot. 

'It was the reason I read Engineering at Cambridge, and ideally would have joined British Airways after graduating, but sadly their training school wasn’t open at that time.’

She added: ‘I’ve always wanted to be a pilot, ever since I was very young.

‘I grew up in the 60s and 70s and in those days girls weren’t allowed to join the RAF as pilots. It was something I’d always wanted to do, but the opportunities back then, as they were in many other industries, they just weren’t there for girls.

The 53-year-old former Countdown host, who qualified to become a pilot in 2013, said that there are currently too few women training to enter the industry

‘I think it’s wonderful that the future pilots programme is trying to attract women as well as men. My girl is 22 and she may well be applying. The opportunities open to her are very different to those open to me and I just think we should celebrate that.

‘Last December, I got my PPL, which is baby pilot’s licence.

‘I’m involved in a very glamorous industry and have been for decades, but it’s never quite satisfied every part of my head to be honest, whereas flying does.

‘Certainly to be fast with numbers and to understand numbers is an important part of flying.’

British Airways runs its own cadet training scheme called the British Airways Future Pilot Programme – open to anyone from 18 to 55. The next application process will begin in February.

The airline’s cadet programme has around 4,500 application each year, with the airline saying there has been a gradual increase in the number of female applicants over the past three years.

Carol Vorderman was announced as the new Ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets in November this year

The company currently have around 200 female pilots – more than any other airline.

British Airways’ First Officer Emily Lester, said: ‘The British Airways Future Pilot Programme has allowed me to realise my dream of becoming an airline pilot.

‘After an intensive training programme I am now flying to destinations throughout Europe and would encourage anyone thinking of a career as a pilot to apply.

‘It’s an ideal route into an incredibly rewarding career for both men and women.’

It was in November this year that Ms Vorderman, became the first woman to be named an honorary ambassador for the Air Cadets.

She has long been associated with RAF-linked charities including the Royal Air Forces Association, the RAF Benevolent Fund and the Bomber Command Memorial committee.

She even led the Salute Area in Green Park in London when the Queen unveiled the RAF Bomber Command memorial in June 2012.

Her two children were both members of the Combined Cadet Force at school, and Carol’s daughter Katie holds an Officer Cadet rank within the Cambridge University Air Squadron.
