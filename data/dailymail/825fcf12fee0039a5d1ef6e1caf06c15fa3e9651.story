A senior Korean Air executive who exploded in a rage at a flight attendant after her peanuts were served in a bag instead of on a dish has today been charged over the incident.

Furious Cho Hyun-ah, a senior vice-president at the airline, angrily demanded the removal of a crew member from a flight for failing to serve her macadamia nuts in the correct way. 

She has now been charged with 'threatening the plane's safety' and could spend up to 15 years in prison if found guilty of the four charges she faces.

Ashamed Cho Hyun-ah arriving at the Seoul Western District Prosecutors Office in Seoul, South Korea, last week. Today she has been charged following her 'nut rage' incident

In December, Cho forced the Incheon-bound flight to taxi back to the terminal at New York's JFK Airport to kick the flight attendant off the plane. 

Flight 86 was already on the runway for its departure when Cho lost her temper after the unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class. 

Furious that he had not followed protocol and presented them in a dish, she screamed at the attendant and told him to bring out the company's in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines.

When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him off the flight. The Airbus A380  eventually arrived in South Korea 11 minutes late. 

Embarrassed Cho, senior vice-president at Korean Air, apologised for delaying a plane leaving New York's JFK Airport over the way she was served nuts. She said sorry for her outrageous behaviour when she appeared in front of South Korean media

Prosecutors said Cho was facing charges of violating aviation security law and obstructing a government investigation. 

Deputy chief prosecutor Kim Chang-hee said Cho had disrupted the flight and 'threatened the plane's safety'.

Prosecutors accused her of forcing a flight to change its normal route, which is the most serious charge and carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.

The three other charges she faces are the use of violence against flight crew, hindering a government probe and forcing the flight's purser off the plane. 

Ashamed Cho could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty of all four charges she faces, according to Attorney Park Jin Nyoung, spokesman for the Korean Bar Association. 

Wearing a black coat, Cho was forced into a grovelling public apology where she sincerely apologised for her behaviour

Following the December 5 incident,  Cho made a grovelling apology where she bowed her head in shame and admitted in a trembling voice that she was 'sorry'.

'I sincerely apologize.' she said, gloomy-faced, adding that she will 'apologize sincerely' at a meeting with the victimized crew member.

Adding to her humiliation, her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho called her behaviour 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he didn't raise her better.

He added that his eldest would resign from her executive roles at all affiliates of Hanjin, the group that controls Korean Air. 

Cho Yang-ho, Cho's father and chairman of Korean Air, said he regretted he had not raised his daughter better and described her behaviour as 'foolish'

South Korean media branded the 40-year-old a princess and while others branded her an embarrassment to her country.

Cho's behavior caused uproar in the country and the airline's defense of her and its attempt to blame the crew member prompted even more criticism.

The incident touched a nerve in a country where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as 'chaebol' that often act above the law.
