Self-styled godman Asaram Bapu is accused of raping the girl when she went to him for healing

Controversial spiritual leader Asaram Bapu is under formal investigation by police for the alleged sexual assault of a teenage girl.

The self-proclaimed 'godman' was booked by Jodhpur police on Wednesday, a day after the 16-year-old girl lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against him at the Kamla Market police station in New Delhi.

The teenager underwent a medical examination that confirmed the sexual assault, a police official said.

According to police, the girl had been studying in a gurukul (school) run by the 72-year-old guru in the Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh's for five years.

Jodhpur deputy commissioner of police Ajaypal Lamba told reporters that staff had sent the girl to see the 'guru' after she said she felt unwell.

'According to the complaint, the girl had fallen ill at the school and the authorities had advised her parents to take her to Asaram who would do a special puja for her cure,' Lamba said.

Accusers say that after a satsang (religious assembly), Asaram moved to his private ashram in Manai, 20km from Johdpur, and called the girl there on August 14.

A day later, he asked the girlâ€™s family members to sit separately at different places for a puja.

The girl says Asaram then took her to a separate 
room on the premise of treating her and forced her to perform 'unnatural sex', according to Lamba.

She then went to 
Jodhpur with her family, where she broke down and told her family of the incident a few days later.

They attempted to confront Asaram at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan,
where he was giving a public sermon on Tuesday.

Having been refused entry by guards, the family took the case to Kamla Nagar police station.

After registering a zero FIR, the Delhi Police transferred the case to Jodhpur.

Asaram's spokesman Sunil Wankhede denied the allegations and said they would be taking legal action against the girl.

'The girl says the incident took place on Aug 15 at Jodhpur. But Asaram Bapu left Jodhpur on Aug 11, so how could this be true?' he said.

In January, Asaram triggered a massive public uproar by the victim of a Delhi gang rape in December last year could have saved herself by addressing her violators as brothers and asking for mercy

The Jodhpur police has booked Asaram under various sections of the IPC including Section 376 (rape) and Section 377 (unnatural sex).
