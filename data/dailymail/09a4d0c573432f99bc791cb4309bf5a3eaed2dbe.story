The demand for 'phablets', large half phone and half tablet devices is growing in Australia

Ever since the first brick-sized portable telephone was released in Australia in 1987, mobile phones have been shrinking in size.

But new research shows that Australian smartphone users now want their phone screens to be bigger, because they spend more time looking at their phones rather than holding them to their ears.

The 'phablet' market – which refers to half-phone half-tablets measuring 5.5 to 6.9 inches - is set to grow as a result.

The study by technology research firm Telsyte found that by 2016 roughly 20 per cent of smartphones users will be using phablets, up from the current number of less than 5 per cent.

This growth in the phablet market largely hinges Telsyte's prediction that Apple will launch a 5.5 inch iPhone 6 later this year.

'We think that arrival of an Apple phablet could spur the market to grow faster than it otherwise would,' Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi told Daily Mail Australia.

'Apple has a strong following and a strong repeat purchase intention among its users.'

Mr Fadaghi said the survey also shows consumers want larger screen than the current iPhone model.

Some 40 per cent of respondents with an intent to buy an iPhone 6 said they had a preference for or would only purchase one if it had a larger screen size.

The research also found that one in five existing Android users who are not planning to purchase an iPhone would 'change their smartphone purchasing decision' if a larger screen iPhone 6 became available.

Mr Fadaghi said people prefer bigger screens because smartphone usage patterns have changed since 2007.

'When the iPhone first came out smartphones were still predominantly used as a phone handset because there were not as many apps and websites,' he said.

'But now we use our smartphones like mini computers, in many aspects of our lives.

'The number of calls people take compared to the number of times people look at website or open up an app or look at a video has gone down as a proportion.'

But while phablets have improved usability the bigger size can be a turn off for some consumers.

'The practicality of larger screen devices for things like going for a run or fitting in a tight pair of jeans is going to be an issue,' Mr Fadaghi said.

Mr Fadaghi added that phones are still getting lighter, despite growing screen sizes.

'Miniaturisation continues to happen with regard to thinness – the components inside the phone have gotten smaller and devices gotten thinner and lighter,' he said.
