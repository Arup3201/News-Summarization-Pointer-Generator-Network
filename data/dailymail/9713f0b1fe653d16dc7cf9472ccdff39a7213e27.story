An Oregon family who became 
desperately ill after unknowingly buying a former meth lab last summer has finally settled with Freddie Mac, which sold them the property.

Beth and Jonathan Hankins, who moved into the property with their infant son last year, are also working with lawmakers to require sellers to disclose if a home has been tested for contamination.

The couple bought the home through HomeSteps, a listing service for Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing organization. Freddie Mac has now said it will review its selling policies.

'After speaking to the Hankins and hearing their concerns first hand we were able to work closely together and come to a mutually agreeable resolution,' the company said, ABC reported.

Relief: Beth and Jonathan Hankins have finally settled with Freddie Mac, which last year sold them a foreclosed home which had previously been a meth lab, making them desperately ill

'We will continue to review and update our policies to protect our buyers and their confidence in HomeSteps homes.'

The settlement amount has not been disclosed.

The couple has now moved 25 miles from the original property in Klamath Falls. The bought the first home for just $36,500 - but had no idea about its history.

Within days of moving into the property with their infant son, Ezra, they began experiencing breathing problems and, after weeks, they were struck with agonizing mouth sores, nose bleeds and migraines.

More than they bargained for: The Klamath Falls, Oregon house on Radcliffe was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property's history

'We mostly experienced extreme dry mouth and had mouth sores, making it extremely painful to even drink water,' Mr Hankins told ABC News at the time.

They were about to call the doctor when a neighbour revealed
the truth about the home's previous tenants and just as 
quickly as they had taken ill, their dream purchase became their 
nightmare.

They bought a $50 testing kit and found that the house on 2427 Radcliffe was
not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 
times higher than the Oregon Health Authority limit.

The
couple promptly moved in with relatives before renting another property
nearby, and now lament that they are facing financial ruin.

Mr and Mrs Hankins, the owner of a coffee house and an ER
nurse,  had bought the home from Freddie Mac for what
they considered a steal, even though they knew it needed work.

Superficial: Before disaster struck, Jonathan Hankins and his two-year-old son Ezra painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it

Good as new? The Hankins spent about $5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home

Decline: Beth Hankins, an ER nurse, started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and Ezra developed mouth sores

'We said, "It needs a little bit of love, but it's got good bones,"' Jonathan Hankins told Yahoo News. 'We just had no idea that those bones were poisonous - the walls were poisoning us.'

After learning of its former use as a meth lab, they contacted Freddie Mac to find out why they had not been told.

They learned the local
authorities had not contacted the Oregon Health Authority, as is 
customary, as there had not been any recent drug-related enforcement 
actions at the home, ABC reported.

Freddie
Mac said it encourages buyers to check federal agency listings kept 
about meth labs, but the Hankins said the organisation only encouraged 
them to test how structurally secure the home was.

The couple delivered a petition
to Freddie Mac's New York offices at the end of the year to ask the 
organisation to require testing of homes for meth residue before they 
are sold.

Unaware: Within days of moving in, Beth started developing breathing problems and just weeks later, the couple's son Ezra, started getting mouth sores and was unable to drink water

Kicked out: A neighbour told them the home had been a meth lab and the couple moved out

Though in 23 states, including Oregon,
laws require sellers to disclose if a property was ever used as a 
clandestine drug laboratory, Freddie Mac claims it had no idea of the 
Klamath Falls house's history.

Freddie
Mac spokesman Brad German told ABC: 'We certainly empathize with the 
situation, but we had no prior information about the way the home had 
been used. If we had, of course, we would have disclosed it.'

Joe
Mazzuca of Meth Lab Cleanup admitted that even with disclosure laws, 
only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible 'you 
don't always see the meth residue.'

'It's extremely dangerous stuff,' he said of methamphetamine.

He also explained that information 
regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks 
by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of 
foreclosure. 

Trouble: The local authority did not alert the Oregon Health Authority about the meth lab, like that pictured, before the house was sold as there had been no recent law enforcement action at the house

The Hankins delivered a petition to Freddie Mac headquarters demanding they take more responsibility

According
to Mr Mazzuca he receives calls from people in exactly the same 
position as the Hankins every three to five minutes and recently heard 
from a man in Michigan who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that 
killed his 14-year-old daughter after two years. 

But
there is hope: Republican state representative Gail Whitsett has 
introduced house bill 3499, which asks for foreclosed or auctioned homes
to be tested for methamphetamine  - or to let would-be owners know the 
property has not yet been tested.

'A lot of people don't think about 
it,' Whitsett told ABC. 'If you buy a home, it's not something that 
comes to the forefront. You don't necessarily think about 
methamphetamine.'

She added that she hopes the meth 
test will become as standard as the lead and mold tests in the state. 
She said around 800 homes scheduled for auction currently have no 
information about their history.
