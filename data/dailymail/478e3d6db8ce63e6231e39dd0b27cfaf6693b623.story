Lauren Silverman was forced to quit her high school after having an ‘improper relationship’ with a married teacher, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. 

Simon Cowell’s pregnant lover was just 16 when she became involved with an English tutor, Steven Lewis, then 26, at her £19,000-a-year private school in Florida. 

Jerry Raphaelson, a classmate of Lauren’s at Miami Country Day School, said: ‘It was a relationship that went on for a month and a half. Virtually all the students knew about it. She was one of the good-looking, popular kids – part of the 'in' crowd.

‘Steve was our English teacher. He was a very good-looking guy, high-energy, personable and very charismatic. Everyone loved him.

'He was as charming as can be. He was very outgoing, very social. He’d pat you on the back, give you a hug.’

According to another friend, who did not wish to be named, the liaison ended when it was discovered by Lauren’s mother, Carole.

The friend said: ‘I think  it all blew up when Lauren’s mother picked up a phone at home – this was back in the days of landlines – and she heard an inappropriate conversation between her daughter and Steve. That’s when the s*** hit the fan.’

Lewis was dismissed while Lauren transferred to University School, Davie, 20 miles north of Miami.

His father, Peter Lewis, said last night that his son quit teaching and had to move away from the area as a result. 

He
 said: ‘He had to leave town because of this bimbo. After he left the 
school, Steve worked for Fedex and worked for a rental car agency and 
then his wife  got a job in Idaho over ten years ago. They have since 
moved  to Montana.’ 

Mr 
Raphaelson, 35, who now lives in Las Vegas, said: ‘It was hushed up. It 
flew like wildfire through the student body but the teachers and 
administration said nothing of it. Mr Lewis left immediately, and I 
recall Lauren leaving shortly after.’ 

Lauren
 was brought up in comfortable, middle-class surroundings. Home was a 
£650,000 house in the suburb  of Hallandale Beach, Florida.

Her father, Steven, now 61, ran  a property business while her mother Carole, 60, was an  estate agent.

However, according to Mr Raphaelson, Lauren liked to run with the racy set even then.

He said: ‘It was an affluent party crowd, and they tried to push boundaries.

'We had a lot of big names at the 
school [Miami Country]. Celebrity students included Bee Gee Maurice 
Gibb’s son Adam, Charlie Sheen’s future wife Brooke Mueller – with whom 
Lauren was good friends – and American Pie actress Natasha Lyonne.

Last night, Steve Lewis declined to comment at his home in Helena, Montana.

But
 his father, who lives in Miami, added: ‘The only people who know the 
full details are Steven and the girl. Steven told me they’d asked him  
to resign. 

‘I don’t know 
how serious  it was. I mean, he’s still married to Michelle, the same 
woman he was married to then. He didn’t leave his wife for this girl. No
 charges were ever pressed.’

According to Lauren’s schoolfriend this was because the school didn’t want a scandal.

The unnamed friend said: ‘It was hushed up. He was let go very quietly. The school kind of shied away from it, because his mother worked there as a music teacher.’

Lauren was not chastened by the experience, according to her boyfriend at her next school, Charlie Ans, now  36.

Speaking at his home in Miami, Mr Ans, a photographer, said: ‘One day after school we were having sex in my bedroom when I suddenly saw my door open and my mum walk in .  .  . then all hell broke loose.

‘Mum started freaking out and was screaming at us to get out of her house. [Lauren] got dressed and left pretty quickly.’

Not that the incident deterred the two 17-year-olds. Ans added: ‘We were typical high-school students,’ he continued.

‘A few weeks later we were back at my house, making out in the shower, when my aunt suddenly turned up.

'I spotted her car pulling up in the driveway and told Lauren she needed to disappear immediately.

'She
 was very slim, so managed to squeeze through my bathroom window. But 
she was totally naked and had to crouch down and hide in the yard until I
 could get a towel out to her. Then I slipped out with her clothes and 
she managed to sneak away.’

Mr Ans, who dated Lauren for five months, admits to being shocked at seeing the news that his first serious girlfriend had become pregnant with Simon Cowell’s child.

He said: ‘It’s all a little crazy and hard to believe she’s the girl I once dated. Lauren is heavier than when I remember her and has obviously had a boob job.

'But she has the same shapely legs and I remember the floral tattoo chain above her left ankle.’

Although Mr Ans had heard rumours that Lauren had had an affair with a teacher at her previous school, he never asked about it. 

He said: ‘I didn’t really know if it was true or not. I never asked her.

'Her parents were probably pleased she was dating someone her own age. In the end, I decided to call it off as I didn’t want to be tied down and she was becoming a bit needy. She was pretty upset.’
