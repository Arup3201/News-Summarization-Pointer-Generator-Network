A paediatrician has been suspended and a hospital matron 'removed' from a Cumbrian hospital where police are investigating the deaths of six patients within eight months, it has emerged.

Police began their investigation after a coroner raised concerns following the deaths of at least four babies and two mothers at Furness General Hospital, in Barrow-in-Furness, in 2008.

The revelation comes as it emerged that mothers and babies are still being put at risk by the hospital.

Final warning: The maternity unit at Furness General Hospital was put on red alert by Monitor yesterday, which oversees standards, and warned it must improve or face closure

On Monday, Monitor, the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts, announced that it has used its formal powers of intervention for a second time at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust.

It said the trust, which runs hospitals in Barrow, Lancaster and Kendal, 'continues to be in significant breach' of measures put in place in October.

The issues relate to maternity services, as well as overall governance at the hospital.

The watchdog's board 'has therefore decided to intervene to strengthen the leadership of the Trust so that it can quickly fix the problems identified', it said.

It has appointed Sir David Henshaw, from Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, as interim chair to ‘drive the recovery of the trust’.

Monitor said the trust would continue to be 'red rated' until further notice.

Last September the Care Quality Commission gave the hospital two months to improve or face closure, and in October Monitor implemented an expert review of maternity services.

The trust was also given a red-flag warning by Monitor, which oversees standards at foundation trusts.

And last September members of the trust’s 
board were ordered to attend a high-level meeting in London.

'We intervened at that stage to appoint clinical experts to review underlying problems in maternity services and to require the trust to commission an independent review into overall governance,' said Monitor.

A letter from Monitor obtained by the Guardian states: 'In its meeting with Monitor on 3 November 2011, the trust stated that changes in staff had been made in the maternity unit at Furness general hospital, including the removal of a matron.'

It went on: 'In its meeting with Monitor on 9 December 2011, the trust stated that staffing issues in paediatricians were known matters and that a paediatrician has been suspended.'

But Monitor's board said it has found the Morecambe Bay Trust in significant breach of the terms of its Authorisation in October 2011.

Original concerns about governance and leadership at the trust have been reinforced by the findings of reviews into maternity services and overall governance, it said.

The report found maternity services suffered from a lack of equipment, such as electronic devices used to monitor a baby's heart rate.

There was also a shortage of training or induction in maternity, which meant some junior and middle grade medical staff did not even know where the adult resuscitation equipment was kept.

It found medical and midwifery teams were not working together and staffing issues meant some people were working more than 12 hours without a break.

A third key point related to the appointment system, with thousands more follow-up appointments missed because of computer problems than previously acknowledged.

The problems stemmed from the introduction of a new computer system called Lorenzo and while the report said the changes were made for good reason, they were made without understanding the risk and the impact to patients.

Monitor said in recent weeks the director of operations, chairman and one of the trust's non-executive directors had resigned.

It deemed the trust's governance processes and systems to be inadequate. Executive directors spent too much time on operational issues and operated 'in a largely reactive manner'.

'They should focus on making key decisions more quickly and in setting a clear direction for continuous improvement of quality,' the regulator said.

Clinical leadership roles were poorly defined and clinical leadership was weak, according to Monitor. Policies that do exist were not consistently applied or evenunderstood by staff, it said.

Monitor's report said: 'Many of the non-executive directors we spoke to were surprised and concerned with the letter that a group of six [later seven] senior clinicians wrote to the previous chairman, in which they raised their concerns about patient safety at the trust and their view that management were not acknowledging their concerns despite 'repeated representations over several years'.'

Tony Halsall, the trust's chief executive, who has resisted calls to resign, said the trust had been working hard to address the issues and 'considerable progress' had been made.

He apologised 'once again' to anyone who had suffered as a result of the trust's failings, and thanked staff for their hard work and commitment.He described Monitor's report as disappointing and 'less than complimentary'.

'The additional resources and expertise at the top of the organisation will help us resolve the shortcomings and weaknesses as quickly and effectively as possible, whilst also making longer term improvements to our services,' he said.

In a statement released through the trust's website, Mr Halsall said: 'The three key reports undoubtedly make uncomfortable reading for the Trust but we accept their findings.

'Everyone has been working hard to make the changes that are needed to resolve the current issues at the Trust and considerable progress has already made.'

Monitor's report said there was 'an ongoing significant risk for mothers and babies', and it was seeking a shake-up of the trust's board.

Stephen Hay, Monitor's chief operating officer, said: 'The action we are taking now is designed to strengthen the trust's board so that it can move quickly and effectively to deal with the concerns identified.

'Sir David Henshaw is an experienced chair and it will be his job to take whatever action is necessary to fix the problems so that patient care is delivered to the standards they should be able to expect – now and in the future.'
