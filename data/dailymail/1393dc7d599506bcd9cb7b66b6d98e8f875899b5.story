At first glance, it looks like millions of pounds of ocean liner has run aground on rocks.

Thankfully, the ship's setting is deliberate, as someone decided to take the full cruise experience and drop anchor on dry land for the first hotel of its kind.

The Sun Cruise resort in Jeongdongjin, South Korea, is perfect for those who find the motion of the ocean leaves them feeling sea sick.

The Sun Cruise resort looks like it is teetering off the edge of a cliff but it's really in ship shape

Guests at the South Korean resort enjoy all the fun of a cruise ship without the motion in the ocean to make them feel seasick

Guests can 'come ashore' and light up the barbecue in the ship's gardens

Despite appearances, the ship isn't a wreck and is open to visitors

The town is said to be one of the most popular spots in South Korea to watch the sun rise across the Sea of Japan, especially on New Year's Day.

The revolving bar at the top of the ship lets visitors gaze at a panoramic view of the horizon.

Canny tourists can enjoy the whole experience for about 80,000 South Korean won - only Â£45.12 a night, though flights to get there may cost a little more.

The ship has 211 cabins, ranging from hotel-style bedrooms to private apartments.

The 'at sea' experience is completed by a seawater swimming pool

Even though there's no risk of losing a golf ball to the ocean, the driving range is still netted for the safety of other guests

Golfers still get to tee off while overlooking the ocean - and they can't blame the waves if a shot goes wrong

Gym bunnies can keep up their workout if they don't fancing leaving the boat for a run

They have portholes for windows for the 
authentic feeling of sailing away to sea and even play sounds of waves 
lapping against the ship, reports the Sun.

The 30,000-ton boat has six restaurants, a gym, swimming pools filled with sea water and a covered golf range so guests can tee off into an ocean view.

Karaoke and clubbing is on offer - and you can even hold your wedding on board if that floats your boat.

All the entertainment included in a cruise can be found on the boat, including big screen karaoke

The cabin windows have portholes overlooking the sea for an authentic ocean liner feel

There are 211 guest rooms on board, ranging from bedrooms to apartments

You won't be able to pretend you're swimming along in the bath as the ship sails, but the view is pretty spectacular all the same
