Sunderland 

Striker Steven Fletcher will be fit for Monday night's  Premier League trip to Crystal Palace.

The Scotland international limped off shortly after half-time in last Saturday's 2-0 home defeat by Arsenal with a foot problem, but has recovered and is expected to resume at Selhurst Park, while there could be a debut for full-back Anthony Reveillere.

However, there is no other good news for head coach Gus Poyet with defenders Sebastian Coates (thigh) and Billy Jones (hamstring) and midfielders Ricky Alvarez (knee) and Emanuele Giaccherini (ankle) still on the sidelines.

Provisional squad: Mannone, Pantilimon, Reveillere, Van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Roberge, Cattermole, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Mavrias, Wickham, Altidore, Fletcher, Graham.
