During this Sunday's Super Bowl, for the first time ever, the National Football League will air a commercial that deals with the horrors of domestic violence head-on.

The 60-second spot is part of the NFL's ongoing affiliation with No More - a coalition of groups dedicated to fighting domestic abuse - and is a dramatization based on a real 911 phone call in which a female victim appeals for help by pretending to order a pizza.

No characters or scenes of violence are shown on the video. Instead, audio of the chilling call is played as the camera pans around the victim’s home, which shows signs of a recent altercation: like a fist-shaped hole in the wall and a smashed photo frame.

The NFL donated the airtime for the spot and paid Grey, a New York ad agency, to produce it.

It will air during the first quarter of Sunday's game, as part of the football league's ongoing effort to take a stand against domestic violence - a contentious subject given a string of recent scandals regarding some of its players.

In the spot, a woman calls 911 and tells the operator her address, immediately before saying she'd like to order a large pizza.

Eerie: No characters or scenes of violence appear, simply a dramatized voiceover based on a real 911 phone call in which a female victim appeals for help by pretending to order a pizza

'Ma'am you've reached 911 - this is an emergency line,' the operator responds, but the woman pushes on, insisting she'd like to order a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and asking nervously, 'do you know how long it will be?

The operator, catching on, asks if the woman is actually having an emergency, to which she curtly responds, 'yes.'

'Is there someone in the room with you?' asks the operator.

'Yes', the woman responds. The operator then informs the caller that help is on its way, before she hastily hangs up and the commercial ends with the line: 'When it's hard to talk, it's up to us to listen.'

Amid the flurry of high-octave Super Bowl ads starring beer, cute puppies and scantily-clad women, No More's tense spot is likely to stand out by a mile.

According to Ad Week, the commercial will also run on digital channels and get promotion from celebrity supporters.

The pre-release of No More's spot comes just weeks after the Baltimore Ravens reached a settlement in the disturbing domestic violence case that led to football star Ray Rice's suspension from the game.

While the terms of the settlement have not been released, Mr Rice had been seeking more than $3.5 million for wrongful termination.

The three-time Pro Bowl running back was released from the team after footage of him knocking out wife Janay Rice - then his fiancee - in an elevator was released publicly by gossip site TMZ in September.

Brutal: Elevator surveillance cameras caught the moment that Mr Rice punched his then-fiancee in the face in an Atlantic City casino elevator leaving her sprawled out on the floor

The brutal assault saw Mr Rice dragging his fiancee out of the elevator, sparked national outrage and highlighted the often overlooked issue of domestic violence in the NFL.

However,  months after the assault, Baltimore Ravens President Dick Cass said it is now time 'to turn the page' on the incident.

The NFL is still keen to show it is against domestic abuse, saying it will  continue its work within the community on the issue of intimate partner abuse.

Mr Rice became a free agent earlier this month after former federal judge Barbara S. Jones overturned NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's indefinite suspension and reinstated him. 

But he hasn't yet drawn interest from any teams.

In December, Mr Rice chose a Christmas fundraiser collecting toys for needy children for his first public appearance since the video of him knocking out his wife in an elevator was released. 

On the field: During his appeal, Mr Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying the player's (pictured) two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice

The 27-year-old attended the Toys for Tots fundraiser, held at the Jimmy's Famous Seafood restaurant in Dundalk.

During an interview, Mr Rice said, 'it feels good to be out and among the Baltimore community and just to give back'.

He also addressed the aggravated assault charges laid against him last year.

'I made a horrible mistake in my life, but, you know, if you truly believe in second chances, you know, they will forgive me,' Mr Rice told CBS Baltimore. 

'We wish Janay and Ray Rice the best,' Mr Cass said.

More: There have been a spate of additional abuse cases among players including Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson (left) and Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary (right)

Since the Mr Rice incident brought the issue of abuse to the fore, there have been a spate of similarly shocking incidents with other NFL players.

Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, created a storm of controversy after he admitted to hitting his son with a switch. 

And earlier this month, Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair met during an evening of heavy drinking in early December.

Mr McNary was taken into police custody earlier this month after charges of rape, criminal confinement with bodily injury and battery resulting in bodily injury were filed against him.
