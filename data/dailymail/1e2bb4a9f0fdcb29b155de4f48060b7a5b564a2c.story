Google and Microsoft are among the businesses attempting to stop Marriott hotels from blocking guest’s personal internet devices in attempt to avoid expensive charges.

Hotel guests wishing to avoid expensive Wi-Fi costs have been powering their internet with their smartphones to the chagrin of some establishments.

Marriott (MAR) and the hotel lobby American Hospitality & Lodging Association petitioned the FCC this summer to allow hotels to prevent people from turning their phones into Wi-Fi hotspots.

Marriot and the hotel lobby said that guests could also use their phones to attack the hotel's Wi-Fi network and to threaten the privacy of other guests.

The large chain hotel complained that guest's devices slowed down the internet speed for other customers and interfered with the hotel Wi-Fi system.

CNN says Marriot received roughly 21 responses to their requests most of which said that the hotel simply wants to overcharge guests for internet.

'If a customer arrives at a hotel with her own Mi-Fi device and the hotel interferes with the customer's connection to that personal hotspot, the hotel can effectively force the customer to purchase the hotel's Wi-Fi services to gain access, even though the customer has already paid her mobile operator for personal hotspot capability, ‘said Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) in a filing to the FCC opposing Marriott's request.

Google agreed with Microsoft that blocking internet hotspots 'would undermine the public interest.'

Business Insider reports that Hotels have been caught using Wi-Fi blockers in the past and had to pay the fine.

In October after the FCC found out that The Marriot Hotel group blocked Wi-Fi networks during an event at a hotel in Nashville, they were fined $600,000.

The FCC said that consumers who have bought data plans from their own service providers should be able to use them instead of paying the hotel up to $1,000 per device to use its own Wi-Fi facilities.
