A top children's doctor has been killed while kayaking on a turbulent stretch of river on his day off.

Consultant paediatrician Dr Damian Pryor, 52, was paddling down a stretch of rapids yesterday when he began to struggle in fast waters.

Emergency services went to River Tawe at Ynyswen, Swansea Valley, after witnesses saw him going underwater.

Emergency services saved him from the water after he was seen going under but he later died in hospital

Keen canoeist Dr Pryor was plucked from the river and taken to hospital where doctors tried to save his life, but he later died.

Dr Pryor, who worked as a consultant in paediatric intensive care at the University Hospital of Wales, was an active member of the Cardiff Canoe Club.

A spokesman for the club said: 'Our well respected Dr Damian Pryor died pursuing what he loved on the River Tawe, despite every effort by his colleagues and the emergency services.

'A full inquiry is underway and our heartfelt thoughts are with his family and friends. He will be dearly missed.'

Friends said the 'well-respected' doctor was 'doing what he loved' when the accident occured

The River Tawe was swollen yesterday following heavy rainfall across the UK in recent days and weeks

Rescuers pulled Dr Pryor from the river and he was taken to hospital. Another kayaker survived uninjured

A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman said: 'A report was received that a male kayaker had got into difficulty on the river. Fire service and Mountain Rescue were called to the scene as part of the rescue operation.

'The man was rescued from the water and was conveyed to Morriston hospital (near Swansea) by ambulance. He was taken to hospital and subsequently died.'

Dr Pryor was with a friend who also got into difficulty in the rough waters around midday on Monday, but the other man escaped from the river uninjured.

The coroner has been informed of the death.
