A Southern Illinois University student who was found dead in woods earlier this year died of a blunt force head trauma and not hypothermia, a second autopsy has revealed.

The family of Pravin Varughese, from Morton Grove ordered a second investigation into the death of the 19-year-old, which discovered 'significant injuries' to his face.

Independent forensic pathologist Ben Margolis discovered the sophomore criminal justice major suffered four different blows to the face and head.

The family of Pravin Varughese, from Morton Grove ordered a second investigation into the death of the 19-year-old, which discovered 'significant injuries' to his face

He said the injuries could not have been caused by a single impact, such as accidentally falling and striking himself on a tree or rock.

An earlier autopsy by the Jackson County coroner’s office said that he died of hypothermia with no evidence of foul play.

Pravin had been missing for nearly a week before his body was discovered in February.

His body was originally discovered on the morning of February 18 in a wooded area near the Carbondale school.

He
 had been reported missing after he was last seen leaving a party at 
11pm on February 12 - three miles away from where his body was 
discovered.

Independent forensic pathologist Ben Margolis also discovered the sophomore criminal justice major suffered four different blows to the face and head

An earlier autopsy by the Jackson County coroner's office said that the teenager (pictured her with two unknown females) died of hypothermia with no evidence of foul play

Carbondale police said he had been dressed in just jeans and a shirt on the night and temperatures had dropped into single digits

They
 had said he had fled into the woods after a dispute with a 'recent 
acquaintance' who had been giving him a lift - but they added that he 
had left the car on his own accord.

His mother Lovely Varughese told the Chicago Tribune that she 'knew something was wrong', and added: 'But I didn’t expect it to be this big.'

His mother Lovely Varughese is now asking questions into how the authorities handled the investigation into her son's death

She added that the new results had given her the feeling that she was not crazy, and said: 'The instinct as a 
mother, and the knowledge as a nurse, I think it paid off.'

The
 second study of the student's body also revealed injuries to his 
forearm, left thigh and bruises and scratches below his knee the 
pathologist said.

But Margolis did not say how Varughese sustained the head injuries. He will now study initial police and coroner records.

He told the paper: 'The cause of death is blunt force injury, but the cause of those injuries is pending further investigation.'

Ms Varughese is now asking questions into how the authorities handled the investigation into her son's death.

Jackson County coroner’s office had earlier said hypothermia was ruled as the preliminary cause of death, and that he had probably got into difficulty trying to find his way out of the woods.

Ms Varughese said she will fight until her last breath to find out what happened to her son.
