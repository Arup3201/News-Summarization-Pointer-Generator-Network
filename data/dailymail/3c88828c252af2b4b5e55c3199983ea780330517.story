Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, who hid a £1bn trove of suspected stolen Nazi art has died in his Munich flat

The ownership of a £1billion hoard of masterpieces plundered by the Nazis during the Second World War has been thrown into doubt by the death of its keeper.

Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, whose father Hildebrand built the  collection while working for  Hitler, died in the Munich flat where he kept the paintings.

They included works by Renoir, Matisse and Picasso that were either looted or bought from Jews at knock-down prices.

Mr Gurlitt, an eccentric recluse, had been selling them over the years to support himself.

The collection of more than 1,400 works was discovered in a raid by customs officials in 2012, but news of its existence only surfaced last November amid tax and ownership disputes.

Mr Gurlitt never married or had children, but a number of his cousins could qualify as heirs to the collection.

However, experts said his death could leave the paintings in legal limbo for years to come.

‘What will become of his treasure?’ one newspaper asked. Süddeutsche Zeitung added: ‘How much was his and how much was Nazi art? He leaves behind as many puzzles as pictures.’

Mr Gurlitt, who had been ill with a heart condition, learnt just two months ago that he would be allowed to keep several hundred paintings after prosecutors said they could find no evidence that they had been looted.

He claimed all the paintings were legally acquired by his father, but at least 500 were found to have been either stolen by the Nazis or were strong-armed from Jewish collectors at rock-bottom prices.

Mr Gurlitt’s father was Nazi Germany’s leading expert on modern art, personally tasked by Hitler to sell paintings he despised abroad to help fund the Third Reich’s war effort.

However, Mr Gurlitt Snr secretly kept many of the  pictures for himself.

After the war, he was questioned by the American Army’s ‘Monuments Men’ unit but never charged with any crimes. He lied that the bulk of his collection had been destroyed in the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945.

In fact, the artworks survived intact and he passed them on to his son, a lifelong bachelor, who said before his death: ‘I never loved anything or anybody in life but my paintings.’

The collection, which includes works by Picasso, Matisse and Dix was discovered inside his Munich apartment

Under a new deal with prosecutors, art historians will have a year to examine the 1,401 works to establish where they came from and if they were stolen (pictured, a work by Otto Dix)

In 2011, he was investigated as a 
possible tax fraudster when he was found with money he could not 
explain, but investigators later found paintings hidden behind tins of 
beans and out-of-date food in his flat.

In February this year, more paintings, worth at least £100million, were found in a house he owned in Salzburg, Austria.

But a court decided he could get between 300 and 350 paintings back.

Under the terms of deal, the 
art will be held at a secret location for a year while historians carry 
out background checks on each of the paintings.

At the end of this year any 
painting which investigators had not finished studying would have been handed back to the 81-year-old.

Augsburg
 state prosecutor Matthias Nickolai said at the time: 'We have come across new 
evidence in the course of the investigation ... that leads us to 
re-evaluate the legal situation.'

Gurlitt's lawyer Tido Park applauded the decision to release the art, saying: 'It's a good day for Cornelius Gurlitt.'

The
 German government came under fire - especially by families whose 
relatives were robbed by the Nazis - for keeping silent for almost two 
years about the trove of art works.

Gurlitt was arrested in 2012 but it wasn't until last year that knowledge of the collection became public.

Separately, representatives for Gurlitt 
later secured a further 238 artworks at a dilapidated house he owned in 
Salzburg, Austria.

Gurlitt was never under investigation in Austria and 
those works weren't seized by authorities.

Gurlitt was set to have the paintings returned at the end of the year if investigators could not unearth whether they were stolen (painting by Henri Matisse)

One of the pieces of work discovered in his flat was this masterpiece by Franz Marc

Last year it transpired that Mr Gurlitt had given four of his paintings to his brother-in-law. They may also have been looted by the Nazis, according to the authorities.

What happens to the artwork now remains to be seen. It could go to Mr Gurlitt's younger sister, Benita, but she would have to be named in a will - and such a document has yet to surface.

Christopher Marinello, Director and Founder of Art Recovery International, told MailOnline: 'It's a pretty murky situation. We don't know if he left a will. If his lawyers were smart they would have cleared up the issue in advance. It'll get cleared up over the next couple of days.'

One of the works of art in the trove - a Matisse valued at up to £60million - has been claimed by the ex-wife of Dominique Strauss Kahn.

Sitting Woman is thought to have belonged to Anne Sinclair’s maternal grandfather, the late French art dealer Paul Rosenberg.

Mr Marinello is representing the Rosenberg family and added that he's confident it will be returned to them.

He said that a second claim for the painting had 'been dispensed with'.

Gurlitt stayed out of sight after news of his collection broke, barely talking to media, and was apparently overwhelmed by the publicity. In January, his representatives said they were considering claims for some of the works and that he was seeking ‘fair and just solutions’ to the case.

‘So much has happened in the past weeks and months, and is still happening,’ he wrote on a newly created website shortly afterward. ‘I only wanted to live with my pictures, in peace and calm.’

Gurlitt was born in Hamburg in 1932 and came from a prominent German family of artists, composers and collectors, but little is known about his life beyond his position as the heir of his father Hildebrand's art collection.

When U.S. investigators questioned Hildebrand Gurlitt after the end of World War II about the origins of his collection, they were doubtful whether all the pieces really belonged to him but eventually decided that he was the rightful owner of most of them.

After his father's 1956 death in a car accident, Cornelius Gurlitt lived together with his mother in Munich until she died in 1968. He reportedly lived a reclusive life, making a living by selling paintings from time to time.

Experts who examined the pieces seized in Munich said they included both ‘degenerate art’ and looted art.

The Nazis took so-called degenerate art - mostly avant-garde modern art, such as expressionism - from museums and public institutions because it was deemed a corrupting influence on the German people. Looted art was stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell under duress during the Third Reich.

For the heirs of those collectors, the discovery raised hopes of recovering art, but the slow release of information by the German government stirred frustration.

After much back and forth, Gurlitt eventually agreed last month to a deal with the German government, under which hundreds of works owned by the collector would be checked for a Nazi-era past while staying in government hands.

Nine hundred and seventy of the works were believed to have been confiscated, stolen or looted by the Nazis. Pictured is Otto Griebel's Die Verschleierte ('The Veiled', 1926)

The works were first discovered in 2012. Pictured is Otto Griebel's Child at the Table

The remarkable find was first revealed in Germany's Focus magazine. Pictured is Carl Spitzweg's Das Klavierspiel ('Piano Serenade', about 1840)

Prosecutors who initially confiscated 
all the works of art they found at his apartment then announced that 
they were releasing the rest of the collection. Gurlitt's lawyers had 
argued that the prosecutors acted disproportionately in seizing the 
entire collection, and that the art wasn't relevant as evidence for 
prosecutors' suspicion of import tax evasion.

Monika
 Gruetters, Germany's culture minister, said on Tuesday that Gurlitt's 
decision to work with authorities deserved ‘recognition and respect.’

‘It
 will remain to Cornelius Gurlitt's credit that he ... sent an exemplary
 signal for the search for fair and just solutions with this avowal of 
moral responsibility,’ she said.
