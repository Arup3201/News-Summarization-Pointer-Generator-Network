Graham Bradley, one of the most controversial figures in British racing, has issued a plea to be allowed to pursue his aim of becoming a trainer after he and Brendan Powell were both cleared of a serious breach of the rules by a BHA disciplinary panel.

The panel dismissed charges that Bradley, a registered employee of Lambourn trainer Powell, had been training horses and running them under Powell’s name.

The pair, also accused of acting in a manner prejudicial to the integrity, proper conduct or good reputation of the sport, faced bans of up to three years.

Bradley’s application to become a trainer, lodged in May 2013, has been on hold pending the outcome of the case.

The prospect of him returning to the sport in a frontline role will fill the BHA with alarm but they will now have to grasp the issue.

Bradley, 54, remains a figure who sharply divides opinion.

A jockey who could turn race-riding into an art form, his biggest wins included the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup on Bregawn and the 1996 Champion Hurdle on Collier Bay.

But the stain on the reputation of a man, who also has operated as a successful bloodstock agent, is the five-year ban slapped on him by the Jockey Club in 2002 for receiving money for tips from Brian Wright, a man subsequently sent to jail for 30 years after being exposed as one of Britain’s biggest drug dealers.

Bradley said: ‘Things happened a long, long time ago. I am a lot older and wiser now. I regret things I have done in the past but I have committed the crime and paid the penalty.

‘It is time to move on and let me re-build my life for my family.

‘I applied for a licence on May 28, 2013. I submitted a business plan and had a little yard. That yard has definitely gone but now this is out of the way I want to move on and look for another one.

‘I have been in racing a long time, it is my life. I was a very successful jockey and bloodstock agent. Now hopefully they will let me get on with trying to be a successful trainer.’

The case against Bradley and Powell was the first of its type ever pursued. Asked if he thought the BHA’s desire to keep him out of the sport had motivated the case, Bradley added: ‘They have a job to do and were acting on intelligence.

‘But myself and Brendan told them what we were doing which was just working very hard to secure both our futures. Thankfully, the panel has come to the right decision.’

The BHA said it was ‘disappointed’ by the Disciplinary Panel’s verdict, adding a decision on Bradley’s trainer’s licence application would not be made until it had had a chance to study the reasons for the decision.

Spokesman Robin Mounsey said: ‘It is too early to comment on how this process will now pan out but we will be in contact with Graham Bradley to discuss the status of his application in due course. The Disciplinary Panel’s reasons will be integral to the way in which this matter is taken forward.’

In August, the BHA lifted a 10-year ban on jockey Fergal Lynch riding in Britain which had been imposed after he admitted stopping Bond City from winning a race in August 2004.
