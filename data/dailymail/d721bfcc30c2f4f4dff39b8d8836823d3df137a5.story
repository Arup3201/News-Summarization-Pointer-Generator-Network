Stoke City are challenging West Ham for Sampdoria midfielder Pedro Obiang.

Chief executive Tony Scholes was understood to be in the stands as Sampdoria played out a 1-1 draw with Verona on Wednesday night. 

The 23-year-old Spaniard, who started out at Atletico Madrid, is available for around £6million.

Obiang was capped for Spain at youth levels, representing their Under 17, 19 and 21 teams, but is yet to feature at senior level.

The towering midfielder has become an integral part of Sampdoria's side, with 84 appearances since arriving from Atletico Madrid's youth set-up in 2010. 

Sampdoria are chasing Europe in Serie A this season, currently fifth placed in the league table, but could be tempted by a move to the Premier League.
