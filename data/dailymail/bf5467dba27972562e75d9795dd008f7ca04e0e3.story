A mother who ballooned to 20st eating takeaways when her daughter was seriously ill has gone on to shed 7st.

Jodie Edkins, 34, from Belper, Derbyshire, was a self-confessed McDonald's addict, who would devour McDonald's food every day - and often for every meal.

She ballooned to a size 26 after gorging on the greasy takeaways when her daughter, Isla, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011.

She spent so much time looking after her daughter, she grabbed meals from a drive thru’ on trips back and forth from the hospital.

But after Isla was given the all-clear, Mrs Edkins realised she had become someone she didn't recognise - and after quitting her Big Mac habit, has lost 7st.

During the past three years, Mrs Edkins has devoured over 1,000 Big Macs.

She said: ‘I was a McDonald's addict. It was a dirty cycle of eating as the food was so cheap, quick and easy.

‘It was a quick fix - a case of grab and go. I had to be there for my daughter so I didn't have time to prepare anything healthy, or sit down to a home cooked meal.’

The stress of looking after Isla and ferrying her to and from hospital meant Mrs Edkins was constantly indulging her McDonald's habit.

She said: ‘With Isla being in hospital, I didn't have time to think of me, so I would just grab McDonald's wherever I could.

‘We would always make a pit stop at the drive thru’ on the way to or from the hospital.

‘And when we got home, I was too exhausted to cook so we would get a McDonald's meal.

‘I was an addict and to make it worse, the McDonald's was literally across the road from my house. It was so convenient, quick and cheap.’

At her heaviest Mrs Edkins weighed 20st and wore a dress size 26 meaning she was severely obese.

Mrs Edkins, who works at Morrisons, said: ‘My priority was Isla and making sure she was alright, so I didn't really think about myself or how big I was getting.’

In 2013 the family received the news that Isla was able to have an operation to remove most of the benign tumour and the little girl is now fully recovered.

And this positive news meant Mrs Edkins could spend more time to spend on herself, for the first time in three years.

She said: ‘I was going out one evening and I looked at myself in the mirror. I hadn't realised how big I had got.

‘I was horrified and didn't recognise the person I saw.’

Mrs Edkins realised all the days eating McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and dinner had had a massive effect on her weight, and health.

She said: ‘I was out of breath all the time and it was a struggle to pick up my children- which was awful.

‘I finally realised how much I had neglected my health, eating all the Maccys all time. I was an addict and I needed to stop.’

Mrs Edkins, who is also mother to ten-year-old Izaak and Frankie, four, went to McDonald's for her last supper in June 2013, and had a Big Mac for one final time.

She said: ‘After that I knew I had to turn my back on the McDonald's for the sake of me and for my family.’

Since then she has lost a staggering 7st thanks to the support of her Slimming World group and is now a size 14.

She makes home cooked meals such as chili and salad, or pasta, and eats yoghurt and fruit for lunch.

She said: ‘My children and my husband Doug can't believe the change in me- a year ago I was addicted to McDonald's but now I am loving my figure and leading a healthier life.’

Mrs Edkins has now trained to be a Slimming World advisor in her home town of Belper.

She said: ‘I am so pleased I turned my back on the McDonald's. I look forward to going shopping now because of all the clothes I can wear and I want other busy mums to know that they can lose the weight too.

‘I don't even miss the McDonald's now- I am so much happier without it in my life.’
