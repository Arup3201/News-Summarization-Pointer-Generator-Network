A mother-of-four was so ashamed by a picture taken of her during a day at the Ascot races that she embarked on a health kick and shed more than 5st in weight.

Melody Feldsted, 33, from Slough, saw her weight creep up after the birth of her first child when she was 18. At her heaviest she weighed 16st 3lb and wore size 20 clothes.

Today, after slashing her calorie intake by 25 per cent, hitting the gym and quitting cigarettes, her weight is a healthy 10st 11lb and she can fit into size 10 outfits.

She said a photo of her in her Sunday best taken at Ascot in the summer of 2012 shocked her into taking decisive action.

Mrs Felstead, a former shop assistant, said: 'I looked at the photo and thought, "oh my God, that can't be me".

'I looked overweight and unhealthy. I wondered how I'd allowed myself to get like that, and why anyone had allowed me to go out looking so large.

'I hated the way my legs looked fat, and my face appeared very wide. It was a nice dress and I didn't do it justice at all. I couldn't stand the thought that it had been shared with other people - I asked my friend to take it down.'

Mrs Felstead, who is 5ft 6in tall, saw her body shape change after the birth of her sons Jordan, now 15, Bradley, 11, Brendan eight, and Mikey, three.

Her weight topped 13st following the birth of her youngest son, and Mrs Felstead saw the pounds pile on rapidly following her decision to quit her 20-a-day smoking habit in January 2011.

She said: 'I wasn't consciously aware of
 eating more, but I was gaining weight. I expect my metabolism slowed 
down and I was subconsciously substituting cigarettes for snacks.

'I enjoyed biscuits - custard creams, shortbread and Jammie Dodgers. I took me a long time to realise that eating biscuits adds a lot to your daily intake.'

As her weight crept up, Melody became more and more self-conscious.

'I
 was really embarrassed about the way I looked in a swimsuit - I looked 
far too large and unhealthy. I only wore it because I was overseas and 
knew no-one I knew would see me in it. If I'm around people I know, I 
never wear swimsuits.

'I tried not to care what people thought, but inside I was very unhappy.'

But it was the Ascot photograph was the final straw.

She
 said: 'One of my friends put the picture on Facebook, which was 
mortifying. They told me they didn't think I was particularly large, but
 I thought I looked huge.'

Mrs
 Felstead decided to join a local gym where she and her husband Jamie, 
34, an electrician, both took advantage of a special offer which granted
 them annual membership at a discounted rate.

She
 said: 'We had an induction where I was weighed for the first time in as
 long as I could remember. When the scales reached 16st 3lb I was 
shocked.'

She began going to the gym three times a week, tackling a wide variety of cardiovascular exercises including running and cross training.

She also began counting calories, slashing her intake. Within a year she'd lost five stone.

She said 'I didn't change the food I was eating - I just made sure I ate sensible portions. I didn't want to make too many drastic changes because I wanted the changes to be sustainable.'

Today she typically eats porridge with blueberries or raspberries for breakfast, followed by soup with sliced bread for lunch, and a portion-controlled square meal with her children, such as spaghettibolognese or lasagne.

Her combination calorie-counting and 
regular exercise has paid off, as today she tips the scales at 10st 11lb and can fit 
into size 10 clothes.

She
 said her husband Jamie, her partner of 16 years, has had to learn to deal with the attention she now gets on a night out.

She said: 'Not long ago a big group of us went out as wives and husbands. At one point the wives were in one part of the bar, and the guys were in another. Another group of lads approached and started looking me and my friends up and down.

'One of the other husbands was a bit put out that they seemed interested in us, but Jamie's response that he was proud I was so good-looking.

When she looks at the Ascot photo now, she says it doesn't look 
anything like her.

'I look and feel like a completely different person. I
 hate looking at it, although it does make me appreciate how far I've 
come and what I've achieved in losing the weight.'

This weekend Mrs Felstead is taking part in her first ever half marathon at Silverstone. She hopes to complete the 13-mile course in under two hours.

She said: 'I'd signed up for the run ages ago in the hope I'd be fit and healthy enough to do it. The fact that I feel confident enough to take part and achieve a good time is a huge milestone for me.

'I'm proud of what I've achieved. It's so much easier to keep up with the children and I'm even more confident.

'I'm so happy I can fit into the clothes I love, instead of the frumpy old clothes that I used to have to wear.'
