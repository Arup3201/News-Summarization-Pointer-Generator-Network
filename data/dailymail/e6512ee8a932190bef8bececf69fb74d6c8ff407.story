A fireman who gave a puppy mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after rescuing it from a house fire has been dubbed 'an angel' by locals.

Carlos Arana, 42, was called to a blaze in Sagunto, a town in the eastern Spanish province of Valencia.

After putting out the fire, he and his fellow crew members found an unconscious two-month-old Yorkshire Terrier puppy collapsed under a stairwell and a terrified 10-year-old Poodle whimpering beside it.

Carlos Arana found the puppy, which appeared to be dead, at a house where he was tackling a blaze

Fire-fighter Cristobel Jover Badia, who's part of the same crew, said: 'Carlos grabbed the puppy and ran outside where he started pumping its chest.

'The poor little thing was completely limp but Carlos was determined to save him.

'He put an oxygen mask over its muzzle but when neither that nor the pumping worked he carefully prised its mouth open and started giving it mouth-to-mouth.'

Neighbour Nacho Rueda said: 'It all happened very fast.

Mr Arana carefully prised the puppy's mouth open to give it mouth to mouth after an oxygen mask and heart pumps failed to bring the animal round

'The fire crew arrived and had put out the huge flames within minutes.

'And then I saw one of them run out holding the puppy that appeared to be dead.

'But the fireman wouldn't stop and after about five minutes the puppy started to move its legs.'

The firemen then rushed the pup and his Poodle pal to a nearby vets for proper treatment.

Mr Badia filmed the rescue and uploaded the footage to social media, where it has been viewed thousands of times.

He described Mr Arana as 'Valencia's true hero'.

And Facebook users have gone wild for Carlos the Man, as he has been dubbed.

One commentator wrote: 'He is not a fireman, he's an angel dressed up as fireman.'

At the local vets the poodle was eventually given a clean bill of health, but the puppy later died as a result of complications from the fire.

A vet spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, despite the incredible efforts of the fireman, there was just too much smoke damage in the poor thing's lungs.'
