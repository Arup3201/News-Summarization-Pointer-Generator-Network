Roy Hodgson picks his England squad on Thursday for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and a friendly against Italy. Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Rickie Lambert and Saido Berahino were named to face Scotland in November. Daniel Sturridge is fit again now too, but there are three new boys on the block. So what do the likes of Danny Ings, Charlie Austin and Harry Kane have to offer? 

Danny Ings

He’s a very astute and clever player, aware of what’s going on around him in midfield and around the penalty box. His movement and technical ability are good. Ings  looks to go in behind the defender and to face up and receive the ball. He has a bit of pace as well. Here is a player who will really flourish if he ends up at Liverpool, Arsenal or Manchester United because of the amount of chances he’ll the get there. He has a big future.

Charlie Austin 

What people don’t appreciate about Charlie is that he’s scored 15 goals this season yet because QPR are fighting relegation, he’s not had that many chances. He is a born finisher, instinctive in the way that Gary Lineker or Ian Rush was and perhaps the best of the three in that regard. I was with him at QPR and Charlie knows he has to work on his game outside the box, in his positioning and movement. But he will do that, because he is committed learner and though he’s 25, you can see him improving over the next few years.

Harry Kane

Harry’s probably not quite as good a finisher as Charlie, but his all-round game is better. He can play off the front, he can play the one right up the top. His movement is excellent and technically he looks a really good player. His finishing is much more clinical now and he has range, from the header he scored against Arsenal, to shots outside and inside the box. In general, if a player is good enough for the senior squad, I don’t see the sense in sending them back to the Under 21s. It’s unlikely Kane  will get much game time against Lithuania and Italy so he will probably go back to the U21s for the summer tournament. But once he has three or four senior games under his belt, there should be no going back.

Verdict

I don’t think England have had this amount of players to choose from up front since I was manager. Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Ian Wright and Michael Owen meant the likes of as Robbie Fowler, Les Ferdinand and Andrew Cole weren’t first choice. Hodgson might have a similar scenario developing now.
