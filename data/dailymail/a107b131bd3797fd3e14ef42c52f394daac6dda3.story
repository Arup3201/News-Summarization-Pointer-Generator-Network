Lloyds Banking Group said eight members of staff have been dismissed after a financial scandal

Lloyds Banking Group has fired eight members of staff and withheld bonuses worth £3million as part of disciplinary action taken in the wake of July's revelations about rate-fixing. 

The financial giant was hit with fines totalling £218million after an investigation found it had rigged the Libor benchmark interest rate.

However, the group has been unable to take any action against a number of individuals who had already left the bank prior to the bank's £218 million settlement with UK and U.S. regulators. 

Lloyds said it has shared all relevant information with City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority and other relevant authorities.

In July, Bank governor Mark Carney described the actions of Lloyds between 2006 and 2009 as 'highly reprehensible, clearly unlawful and may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals involved'.

Lloyds said unvested bonuses and long term incentives totalling around £3 million in aggregate for the fired individuals will be forfeited.

Chairman Lord Blackwell said the significant reputational damage and financial cost to the group will also be reflected in the options considered in relation to other staff bonus payments.

He said: 'The board has been clear that it views the actions of those responsible for the misconduct referred to in the settlements as being completely unacceptable.

'It is entirely right that the group undertook a prompt, independent and thorough disciplinary process immediately after the settlements were announced and has taken appropriate action as a result. A number if individuals have been dismissed.'

Three of the 'Big Five' British banks were penalised for the Libor scandal, two years after Barclays became the first to be hit with a £290million fine.

The state-backed lender said at the time that the manipulation took place between May 2006 and 2009, and confirmed that those involved had either left the group, were suspended or subject to disciplinary proceedings.

Its investigation was believed to have focussed on 15 members of staff.

'Shocking conduct': Lloyds manipulated rates to reduce the fees it had to pay to the Bank of England

Chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said the bank had taken steps to prevent the same kind of behaviour happening again.

He added: 'The changes we have implemented over the last three years as part of our successful customer-focused and UK-centric strategy have created a culture and values that focus totally on our retail and commercial customers.'

The settlements followed allegations that banks formed cartels to fix two key interest rates used to set the price at which banks lend money to each other for trillions of dollars-worth of financial products, from mortgages to complex financial products.

Some £70million of Lloyds' fine is for attempting to manipulate fees that it owed for taking part in a taxpayer-backed government scheme designed to support the UK's banks during the financial crisis.

While Lloyds' misconduct related to Libor rigging was similar to that of other financial institutions, the rigging of this scheme – the Special Liquidity Scheme – had not been seen before by regulators.

Lloyds will pay the Bank £7.8 million in compensation for the reduction in the amount of fees received by the central bank as a result of the manipulation.

The £105million total fine from the FCA is the joint third highest ever imposed by the regulator or its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, and the seventh penalty for Libor-related failures.

Libor stands for the London Interbank Offer Rate and is a measure of the interest rate banks charge to borrow between each other.

The rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade body the British Bankers' Association. Each bank sets the rates at which it believes it can borrow, from overnight to 12 months. There are 150 Libor rates, spanning ten currencies and 15 time periods.

It heavily influences how banks price variable rate mortages, such as new tracker and discount deals and standard variable rates. Some borrowers also have mortgages linked directly to Libor, which are typically reset every three months.

Traders could make money from tiny movements in the rate due to the millions being gambled on them, however, by the time these shifts of fractions of one per cent reach mortgage pricing their effect would be minimal.

Even those whose mortgages were directly linked to Libor would find changes in their interest rate would have little overall effect.

As part of the settlements on Libor rigging, Lloyds had to pay £35million to the FCA and £62million and £51 million respectively to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Justice.

Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime, said at the time: 'The firms were a significant beneficiary of financial assistance from the Bank of England through the SLS.

'Colluding to benefit the firms at the expense, ultimately, of the UK taxpayer was unacceptable. This falls well short of the standards the FCA and the market is entitled to expect from regulated firms.

'The abuse of the SLS is a novel feature of this case but the underlying conduct and the underlying failings - to identify, mitigate and monitor for obvious risks - are not new.

'If trust in financial services is to be restored then market participants need to ensure they are learning the lessons from, and avoiding the mistakes of, their peers. Our enforcement actions are an important source of information to help them do this.'
