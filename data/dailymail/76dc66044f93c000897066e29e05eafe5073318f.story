Australians attending next year's Gallipoli centenary Anzac Day commemorations have been warned by the government to be vigilant in the wake of increased terrorism threats.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has released preliminary advice on the risk facing travellers heading to Turkey for the event on the Gallipoli Peninsula in April.

While there is currently no indication terrorist groups intend to attack Australians in Turkey, the department warns people should 'exercise a high degree of caution'.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Turkey was on the front line of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Syria.

'The security environment is volatile,' she said, in a statement.

She said terrorists have been active in Turkey before and ISIL poses an extra threat to the region.

However, the Gallipoli peninsular is far from Turkey's borders with Iraq and Syria.

The Department of Veterans’ Affairs, who is managing events to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Anzac landings at Gallipoli, said that a spill-over from the Syrian conflict could lead to attacks against targets in Turkey, including Ankara, Istanbul or areas close to the Syrian border.

Although they said there's no indication that terrorist groups have intentions to attack Australians or Australian interests in Turkey currently, there will still be tight security arrangements in place for the Anzac Day commemorations next year. 

Turkish authorities will screen all visitors on arrival, while all bags will be searched and prohibited items confiscated.
