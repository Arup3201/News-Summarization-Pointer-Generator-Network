With its sweeping views across Central Park, New York's Courtyard-Residence Inn was always set to tower above the competition.

But the 68-storey building in central Manhattan can now officially lay claim to the title of the tallest hotel in North America.

The Marriott hotel, at a towering height of 750ft (228.6 metres), has topped the list compiled by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

Guests staying at the hotel will already know that even the 35th floor gym in the hotel comes with amazing views of Manhattan.

A lofty sun deck also lets those staying at the hotel, which costs on average $300 a night, make the most of the far-reaching park views.

All of the guest rooms in the newly opened $200 million hotel have full-length windows providing views of the park, Times Square or the Hudson.

Close behind the Courtyard-Residence in the tall hotel list is a Marriott in Detroit which, at 221 metres, came second.

The Marriott makes up one of the towers in Motor City's old Renaissance Center, Daniel Safarik of the Tall Buildings Council said.

Both hotels pale in comparison to the world's tallest hotel, the 355m high Marquis Towers hotel in Dubai.

Guests wanting a room even higher than that should book into Hong Kong's Ritz-Carlton, a hotel that fills the top floors of the staggeringly tall International Commerce Center.

The Hong Kong hotel, at the top of the 488m building, is considered the world's highest hotel.

Tall and slender towers in the West 57th Street area of Manhattan are the focus of an exhibition on view at the Skyscraper Museum in Lower Manhattan called Sky High.

Museum director Carol Willis said: 'The key feature of these buildings, as we illustrate in our exhibition, is their slenderness.'
