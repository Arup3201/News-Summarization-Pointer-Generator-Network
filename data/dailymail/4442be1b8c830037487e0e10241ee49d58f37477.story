After a 110-year wait, Hull City's European adventure very nearly lasted just seven days until Sone Aluko intervened to prolong their stay.

But on the evidence of this lethargic and naïve performance, Steve Bruce's side will have to re-emerge with a newfound vigour and maturity when they face a final qualifier later this month.

For now, though, relief is the overriding emotion on Humberside.

They were 10 minutes away from suffering a humiliating first-round exit at the hands of the Slovakian minnows.

Hull's players had already talked of winning the Europa League in Warsaw next May but they were staring at a nightmare until substitute Aluko pounced to volley home from six yards in the 80th minute.

The goal keeps alive the dream of facing the likes of Inter Milan at the KC Stadium this season.

To give their journey some perspective, exactly 10 years ago last night Hull were playing Bournemouth in League One. They won 1-0. Go back 15 years and they were getting beat 1-0 at Exeter City in England's bottom tier.

Bruce handed a full debut to £6million signing Robert Snodgrass as he attempted to inject some energy following a sluggish showing during the goalless draw in Zilna last week.

Trencin signalled their intention from the off when Haris Hajradinovic attempted to lob Allan McGregor from kick-off, the Scottish goalkeeper panicked enough to scramble before gathering.

But there was nothing he could do to prevent Trencin's shock opener just 90 seconds later as Frantisek Kubik escaped down the right and drew back for Tomas Malec to apply a measured finish.

The visitors threatened to double their advantage when a well-worked free-kick landed at the feet of Jakub Holubek and he stung the palms of McGregor with a vicious strike from 20 yards.

Hull should have been level when Shane Long broke free on 15 minutes but his dink was read by Milos Volesak and the stopper spread his frame to block.

Long, though, was guilty of a glaring miss soon after when Snodgrass screwed a shot in to his unmarked feet on the edge of the six-yard box. First he stabbed tamely at Volesak before swiping at fresh air when the ball rebounded. It was an embarrassing passage which left the forward on the floor, face hidden in shame.

But the KC crowd – and Long – exhaled a collective relief just moments later when Robbie Brady loaded a cross from the left and Ahmed Elmohamady rose to power a header into the bottom corner.

Long was enduring a miserable night and he somehow headed straight at nemesis Volesak when a corner was deflected onto his brow just four yards from goal.

Liam Rosenior was introduced after half-time and his first touch – a 25-yard drive – very nearly nestled in the top corner and Tom Huddlestone lashed narrowly over on 73 minutes.

The home side continued to press and their prayers were answered when Aluko connected with Snodgrass' knock-down just yards from goal.
