Alex Salmond is planning a visit to watch the Ryder Cup golf tournament within days of breaking up the 300-year-old Union.

The Scottish First Minister revealed that if he secures victory in his battle for independence, he will travel to Gleneagles to watch the likes of Rory McIlroy and Tom Watson teeing off.

After dire warnings that Yes vote could trigger economic catastrophe, No campaigners accused Mr Salmond of embarking on a 'premature victory lap' instead of answering key questions about how independence would work in practice.

First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured watching the Ryder Cup in Illinois in 2012, has admitted he plans a day out at the tournament at Gleneagles just days after the independence referendum 

Mr Salmond, a keen golfer, suggested that whatever the outcome of the referendum on September 18 he will not miss the Ryder Cup, which starts just five days later at the Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire.

He also insisted that he will abide by the result, and if Scots vote No there will not be another referendum on independence for a generation.

But the revelation that his mind is on golf will draw comparisons with David Cameron and his reputation for being a 'chillaxing' Prime Minister.

Mr Salmond today appeared on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show to set out his latest pitch for independence.

He insisted that if he loses Thursday's vote, he will not try to force another referendum.

'If you remember previous constitutional referenda in Scotland, there was one in 1979 and the next one was 1997.

Mr Salmond's wife Moira has reportedly encouraged him to play golf during the independence campaign to help clear his head

'That's what I mean by a political generation… This is a once in a generation, perhaps even a once in a lifetime opportunity for Scotland.'

In the interview Mr Marr asked Mr Salmond about the prospect of voters backing independence, 'you presumably have a malt, a round of golf and then what happens?'

Extraordinarily, Mr Salmond said: 'I'll probably go to the Ryder Cup the following week, I'm not sure about the malt.'

Mr Salmond's wife Moria is reportedly credited with encouraging the First Minister to regularly take time out from the referendum campaign to play golf to 'unwind and clear his head', according to the Sunday Times.

It also emerged that Mr Salmond was playing against the 14-year-old son of the greenkeeper at Castle Stuart golf course overlooking the Moray Firth when news broke of an opinion poll putting the Yes campaign ahead last weekend.

Today Mr Salmond went on to insist that there will be 'urgent business following a Yes victory on Friday', adding: 'Firstly I think it will be a day of celebration, Scotland will have achieved something astonishing in democratic politics. 'But there's a lot of business to do. And the first and urgent business is to bring Scotland together.

'Because on Friday, after a Yes vote there'll cease to be a Yes campaign and a No campaign. There'll be a Team Scotland. And I've said very clearly that I want into that Team Scotland as many voices as possible, people who have got something to offer and contribute to bring the country together.'

But Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign, accused Mr Salmond of doing a 'premature victory lap' ahead of polling day.

He told the BBC: 'We still don't know how we can ensure that we don't lose jobs, with firms saying they are going to take their headquarters out of Scotland – that would be a disaster for Scotland.

'We still don't know how we are going to replace the additional funding we get for the National Health Service.

'We don't know who is going to pay pensions and you were asking Alex Salmond a few moments ago about currency and he seemed to be doing a rather premature victory lap even before most of us have voted.

'But he was just simply asserting that low and behold on Friday morning, everybody else is wrong, they are all going to fall in line with what he is going to say.'

Mr Salmond has previously faced criticism for spending £7,000 of taxpayers' money on a visit to Chicago for the Ryder Cup in 2012.

He stayed in a suite in the five-star Peninsula Hotel, popular with celebrities such as Brad Pitt, which included a guest powder room, living room, a dressing area, three TVs, a video games console, a surround-sound stereo system and a marble bathroom.

Mr Salmond would have been treated to panoramic views of Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's main thoroughfares, and the city's historic Water Tower Park.

The SNP leader, who was accompanied by three officials, has refused to disclose how much he spent on this weeklong jaunt, dismissing criticism as 'ridiculous frippery'.

But the majority of the 'Team Scotland' delegation in the US at the same time stayed in a more modest hotel near the Medinah golf course, which charges £60 for a room. The entire trip cost taxpayers nearly £500,000.

David Cameron decided against spending the weekend campaigning in Scotland to instead attend a society wedding in Hampshire

With the clock ticking on the countdown to the crunch vote on the future of the Union, Mr Cameron chose not to spend the weekend in Scotland and yesterday attended a society wedding south of the border.

The PM mingled with well-heeled guests in the Hampshire village of Northington, where Samantha's half-brother Jake Astor married Victoria Hargreaves.

The younger son of Viscount Astor and his wife Annabel, 33-year-old Jake is an Old Etonian who studied at Oxford University and works as a Mandarin-speaking investment analyst, while his wife is a consultant for a luxury brand.

The couple were thrown a pre-wedding reception in Downing Street two days ago, laid on by the Prime Minister's wife.  

They are part of the aristocratic Astor family, descended from the 19th Century fur trader and America's first multi-millionaire John Jacob Astor.

Yesterday's wedding came just weeks after Mr Cameron faced criticism for returning to the Cornish surf hours after a crisis meeting about a British jihadi beheading journalist James Foley.
