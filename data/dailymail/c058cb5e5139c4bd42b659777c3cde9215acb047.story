Paedophile Jimmy Savile's claims to be close to the Queen's cousin were hushed up by police, it has been claimed.

The disgraced ex-Top Of The Pops presenter told Surrey Police detectives in a 2009 interview that the first time he attended Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, Surrey, was with Princess Alexandra, now 77.

It is claimed that Savile abused girls at the school.

All mention of Princess Alexandra, the youngest granddaughter of King George V and Queen Mary and the widow of Sir Angus Ogilvy, was blacked out when transcripts of the police interview were released in October.

But following an appeal by the Daily Star Sunday to the Information Commissioner's Office, Surrey Police have released fresh transcripts with at least four mentions of her.

He told detectives: '... right I went there, with Princess Alexandra, and Alex was a friend of mine anyway, still is.'

Savile later added: 'Now that was a great day we all had, the first time I ever went there.'

Chillingly, Savile wrote in 1974 biography: 'Princess Alex is a patron of a hostel for girls in care. At this place I'm a cross between a term-time boyfriend and a fixer of special trips out.'

In 2009 a prosecutor requested that all Savile's books be reviewed to see if there was any mention of Duncroft.

The former radio DJ was discovered to be a prolific paedophile who may have raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450, including children as young as eight, after he died in 2011.

He wrote in Duncroft's visitor book: 'Jimmy Savile called – and fell in love with all!!! I wonder if it’s legal to have 20 wives.'

Women who were pupils at the school, for intelligent but emotionally disturbed girls, were the first to come forward to tell how he preyed on them.

A statement from Surrey Police said: 'Information relating to Surrey Police's on-going investigation into Duncroft School and all personal details of victims or potential witnesses were redacted from the transcripts.

'Following a review by the Information Commissioner's Office, some of the redactions have been shortened or revised.

'This included releasing the name of Princess Alexandra. Her name had been previously published by Surrey Police in a report in January last year and was therefore already in the public domain.

'Savile's biographies were reviewed in 2009 as part of the investigation, as stated in our previous published report.'
