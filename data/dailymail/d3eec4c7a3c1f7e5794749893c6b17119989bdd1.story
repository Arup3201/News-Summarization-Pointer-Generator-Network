The front man of a gore-loving heavy metal band has been found dead, sitting upright in a chair, in his Virginia home.

GWAR singer David M. Brockie, known to fans as intergalactic humanoid barbarian 'Oderus Urungus', was found by his roommate about 7pm yesterday.

Detectives don't currently suspect foul play and said the medical examiner's office will determine the cause of the 50-year-old's death.

TMZ quoted sources as saying drugs weren't found at the West Seminary Avenue, Richmond, home and that it was not a suicide.

Tragic: David Brockie, the singer of heavy metal band GWAR, has been found dead in his Virginia home

Singer: GWAR frontman Dave Brockie was known to fans as 'Oderus Urungus' and appeared as an intergalactic humanoid barbarian with devil horns

The Grammy-nominated band, founded by Brockie in 1984, is known for its comically grotesque costumes, stage antics and vulgar lyrics.

News of the cult singer's death has shocked friends and fans, with messages of condolence flooding social media.

'Today is sad day, we lost a great guy! Dave Brockie / Oderus, if you have any stories of you and Odreus please feel free to share with us. WE MISS YOU Dave! (sic)' Alternative Revolt Magazine wrote on Facebook.

'Dave, you were always the nicest and funniest guy whenever I got to talk to you around town,' band Fire & Ice shared.

'Thanks for getting me into GWAR shows and giving me cool s***. Sorry I was such a punisher as a young kid.'

Former GWAR bassist Mike Bishop said Brockie will be remembered for his creativity, humor and energy.

'He was brash sometimes, always crass, irreverent, he was hilarious in every way. But he was also deeply intelligent and interested in life, history, politics and art,' Bishop told Style Weekly.

'His penchant for scatological humors belied a lucid wit. He was a criminally underrated lyricist and hard rock vocalist, one of the best, ever!

'A great front man, a great painter, writer, he was also a hell of a bass guitarist. I loved him. He was capable of great empathy and had a real sense of justice.'

GWAR, who described themselves as 'Scumdogs of the Universe', released their 13th album last year and recently toured Australia and Japan.

Brockie always appeared on stage as an intergalactic humanoid barbarian with devil horns and a meaty-looking face, carrying a long sword called an 'Unt Lick'.

The heavy metal band gained international fame for their outrageous stage show and wild personas, with GWAR members creating their own gory costumes.

Their video clips were also a staple of TV show 'Beavis and Butt-Head'.

'Anyone who has seen GWAR knows itâ€™s an adult comedy rock musical,' Brockie told CBS 6 reporter Mark Holmberg in 2011.

Style Weekly reported Brockie was a devoted fan of the Washington Redskins and a World War II buff, who had recently fulfilled his lifelong dreams of visiting Stalingrad and playing shows in Japan.

In 2011, GWAR's lead guitarist 34-year-old Cory Smoot was found dead on the band's tour bus.
