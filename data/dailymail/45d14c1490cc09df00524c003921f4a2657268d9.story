Prince William launched his four-day visit to China today with a ceremony to bring good fortune.

The second in line to the throne found himself in the unusual position of having to paint the eyes on a larger than life sheep - British cartoon character Shaun the Sheep, no less.

'You know I can't do two things at once,' he joked with the photographers who asked him to pose up with his artwork.

He added approvingly: 'It's not particularly stylish but it will pass.'

The sheep-marking ceremony signalled the launch of the first ever Year of Cultural Exchange between the UK and China, a showcase of innovation for British goods and services.

In the Chinese calendar this is the Year of the Sheep - and with Aardman Animation's Shaun being the UK's most famous export of the species, the British Council thought it might be fun to marry the two.

The ceremony took place in the gardens of the residence of the British Ambassador, Barbara Woodward.

William was shown five sculptures of Shaun, each decorated by a different artist, which are among 50 such sculptures to be displayed across China and later auctioned off in aid of the Beijing Cultural Development Fund.

The prince joked with photographers who wanted him to pose and paint the eyes on the sheep, saying 'You know I can't do two things at once' 

The prince gamely agreed to finish decorating a particularly patriotic animal, covered in the Union Flag, by painting his eyes.

Dotting the eyes of the traditional lions used in Lion Dances is thought to bring good fortune and happiness - and it is hoped that by William doing this he will bring such benefits to the Year of Cultural Exchange.

It also ties in with the Chinese idiom 'san yang kai tai',which means 'the advent of Spring brings prosperity'.

The prince was accompanied by Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who said: 'We are incredibly proud of our creative industries, they are one of our biggest success stories and a tremendous driver of economic growth.

Crowds of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the second in line to the throne during a visitor to the British ambassador's official residence in Beijing

'The Year of Cultural Exchange will be a wonderful celebration of UK and Chinese creative talent and will help forge new business relations between our two nations. '

Nick Marchand Director of Arts and Creative Industries at the British Embassy said William was a 'fantastic ambassador' for the UK.

'It's wonderful that he can be here to launch this for us,' he said. 

Earlier William visited Shijia Hutong, an elegantly restored courtyard house, resurrected from dilapidation two years ago with funding from the Prince's Foundation, set up by his father, Prince Charles.

Dressed in a smart suit, the prince was greeted by Matthew Hu, China Representative of the Prince's School of traditional arts and Drew Ross, the China MD for the Prince's Foundation.

The Prince also visited Bejing's Forbidden City where he chatted pleasantly about the weather and remarked on what a nice day it was

The prince chatted pleasantly about the weather and remarked on what a nice day it was - not realising the air pollution index for Beijing today is 140, nearly six times the WHO recommended maximum.

He also met with groups of disadvantaged rural children in urban Beijing.

He chatted about the various challenges they face, and was presented with a small hand-drawn picture, drawn by a 10-year old migrant child from poverty stricken Henan province named Wu Qiuyun.

The picture shows a collection of little houses surrounded by foliage and prompted William to 'that will look nice in George's bedroom'.

He was was also introduced to Zhao Chen, 14, who is effectively blind and, with the assistance of his mother, learning opera singing. Mr Zhao said: 'My dream is to go to your palace to sing opera'.

Duke replied: 'Well, you've met the right man. We might be able to arrange something.'
