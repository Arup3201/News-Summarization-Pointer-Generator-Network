A young female kangaroo was left to die a lingering and painful death after being trapped in a snare

The sight of a young female kangaroo that was left to die a lingering and painful death after being trapped in a snare is one of the latest victims to come under attack.

The stricken eastern grey was spotted by a nearby resident after struggling to forage through bushland at Mountain Creek Road in Captains Flat, south of Queanbeyan, NSW.

Wildcare rescuer Diane Hinton told Daily Mail Australia she was called to a property after reports of a severely-injured kangaroo but when she arrived, the terrified marsupial hopped away to finding a hiding place.

‘She was still hopping around so I couldn’t get close to her but I could see she had a broken arm,’ Ms Hinton told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I thought I’d wait a few more days but when I finally got to her on Thursday, she had a snare wrapped around her body and she looked really sick and poorly infected.’

The rescuer was forced to put the youngster down because she had endured too much pain from the metal wire, which had cut through her body cavity and ribs after being tangled as she tried to release herself from the trap.

‘I’ve been rescuing animals for a long time and have seen many horrendous things but it was nothing horrendous like this – it's the worst I’ve ever seen,’ Ms Hinton said.

‘She was ripped apart and you could see into her chest. There were maggots crawling out of her – she had been fly-blown.

‘It made me feel physically ill, disbelieving and horrified that people could do that and think it’s ok.

Ms Hinton said she doesn't know where the snare was set up but believes it could be just kilometres away

Ms Hinton said it was difficult to know where the snare had come from but believed there was a small possibility it was an ‘accidental capture’.

‘It’s obvious someone had set it up to specifically trap wildlife animals,’ Ms Hinton said.

‘It’s inhumane for someone to do that and it makes me feel fearful because if someone could do that to an animal – what makes it any different to take out a farmer’s life?

‘We’ve also heard stories about people chasing them [kangaroos] around in their cars until they get exhausted and collapse, then people would run or reverse over them until they die.

‘There's been times where I’ve stopped to rescue animals on the side of the road and then I see cars and motorbikes go out of their way to run them down – it’s horrible and it needs to stop.’

A young male kangaroo was found with a hunting arrow pierced through the jaw and into the shoulder

The Wildcare rescuers managed to save the youngster and remove the arrow from his shoulder this week

He is currently being taken care of and on the road to recovery before being released back into the wild

The brutal attack comes just days after a young male kangaroo was found with a hunting arrow pierced through the jaw and into the shoulder at Greenleigh in Queanbeyan on Tuesday.

The still-mobile eastern grey had collapsed on a driveway but was safely tranquilised by rescuers before being transported to West Queanbeyan veterinary hospital where the arrow was removed.

The sharp object had only torn through his skin of the shoulder and had missed his bone and muscle.

Wildcare macropod coordinator Helen Stevens told Daily Mail Australia the youngster is on the road to recovery and will be under supervision before releasing him back into the wild.

‘He’s recovering well but we’re angry that people could inflict such pain and suffering on animals,’ Ms Stevens told Daily Mail Australia.

‘It’s been a distressing week for us and you just feel sorry for the animals yourself when you see how stressed they are after being attacked.

‘I’m amazed to see unique wildlife living here but what amazes me more are people’s attitudes towards them – shooting or hurting animals is not correct.’

Anyone found guilty of attacking  animals could face a hefty fine of up to $22,000 or six months in prison

Ms Stevens has called on for more education in schools and the community in a bid to raise awareness and put a stop to animal cruelty.

‘We are trying to educate people so everyone can live alongside wildlife animals,’ Ms Stevens said.

‘Animal cruelty is an unexceptional behaviour.’

Anyone who is found guilty of attacking wildlife animals could face a hefty fine of up to $22,000 or six months imprisonment.

‘There are laws put in place for cats and dogs but it shouldn’t be any different to wildlife animals,’ Ms Stevens said.
