Rangers insist they have not made an approach to Valencia to speak to assistant coach Ian Cathro.

A club spokeswoman says there is no truth in rumours suggesting the Ibrox outfit had made an offer to the Spanish giants for the 28-year-old former Dundee United youth coach.

Kenny McDowall is in charge of the Light Blues for the remainder of the season after boss Ally McCoist was placed on garden leave.

Cathro is one of the hottest prospects in European coaching despite having not even reached 30.

He was spotted by former Scotland manager Craig Levein during his stint as Dundee United boss running coaching classes for youngsters in Tayside and invited to revolutionise the Tannadice youth set-up.

He helped unearth Ryan Gauld and played a significant part in the development of a number of other promising players.

In 2012, he was appointed assistant manager of Portuguese outfit Rio Ave after Nuno Espirito Santo - who he had met on a Scottish Football Association coaching course - spotted his potential.

After the duo guided the side into the Europa League, Santo was offered the head coach role at Valencia, he took the young Scot with him when he made his switch to the Mestalla last summer.

Cathro is highly rated in European coaching circles, despite being under 30
