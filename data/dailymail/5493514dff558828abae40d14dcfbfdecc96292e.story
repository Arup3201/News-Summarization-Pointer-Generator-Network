The older brother of Law & Order star Richard Belzer jumped to his death from the roof of his luxury Manhattan apartment building on Wednesday morning.

The body of Leonard Belzer, 73, was found at 6:45 a.m. in the courtyard of Upper West Side apartment block The Stanton.

Belzer, former host of a syndicated radio show called The Comedy Hour, lived on the 11th floor and is believed to have jumped from the roof of the 15-story high-rise.

Multiple suicide notes were found in his apartment, law enforcement sources said, though it was not immediately clear what they said or to whom they were addressed.

Belzer is believed to have suffered from deteriorating health in recent years, plus the passing of his wife in 2012.

One employee, who sometimes works the night shift at The Stanton, recalled that Belzer had struggled with heart ailments and made multiple trips to ER.

'He was in a lot of pain. He was hurting, stomach problems,' another employee told the NY Post. 'He was also hurting because his wife died a couple years ago. They were beautiful people.'

Keen advocates of spirituality, they had written a book together in 2000 entitled Spiritual Places In And Around New York City.

'Spiritual Places In And Around New York City’ brings together places that Emily Squires and Len Belzer have found valuable in maintaining their own personal sanity amid the frenetic pace of the city,' states the sell on Amazon.

'Each sketch lends spiritual insights and a sensual feel of the place that invites readers to plumb for themselves the mystery and depths of its sacredness. Entries on Communities, Day Trips, Gardens, Museums, Learning and Healing Centers, Libraries and Bookstores, Nature Walks, Restaurants, Overnights, as well as Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, Hindu, and Sufi places of worship.'

Columbia University graduate Belzer was an Air Force Intelligence Service veteran and former  host of The Comedy Hour.

'He has been a student of spirituality and consciousness for the past 20 years,' read his author profile.

Leonard's brother Richard Belzer is most famous for portraying the character of John Munch for 21 years from 1993 to 2014 in the long-running TV series Law & Order.

Leonard and Richard’s salesman dad, Charles, reportedly killed himself in 1968.

The suicide came a year after an earlier attempt had been prevented when Richard had found him passed out from a drug overdose, according to a 1993 People magazine article.

The Belzer brothers endured a traumatic childhood growing up in Bridgeport, Conn. and their mother, Frances, beat them relentlessly.

'Our mother didn't know how to love her sons appropriately,' Leonard told People magazine. 'She always had some rationale for hitting us.'
