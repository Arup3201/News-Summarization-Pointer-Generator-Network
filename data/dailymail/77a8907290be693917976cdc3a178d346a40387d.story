Thousands of protesters descended on the U.S. embassy in Pakistan today over an anti-Islam video causing police to fire live rounds and tear gas into the crowds, injuring 50 people.

An estimated 5,000 demonstrators carrying the flags of hardline Islamist groups pelted police with stones as security forces tried to prevent them from reaching the embassy compound in Islamabad.

The military were forced to intervene due to the size of the crowd, many of them students, and helicopters hovered overheard. Several policemen were injured in the clashes.

Anger: Much of the outrage across the Islamic world has been directed at the U.S. government who have moved to distance themselves from the film

'It is our responsibility to protect all our diplomats, all the foreigners,' said Pakistani Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira.

He criticized protesters for resorting to violence and suggested that various religious and militant groups among the crowd were to blame.

U.S. Embassy advertisements condemning the anti-Islam video appeared on Pakistani television on Thursday in an attempt to undercut anger against the United States, where the film was produced.

The movie portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a fraud, a womanizer and a child molester and has fueled outrage across the Islamic world.Â 

Protesters have directed their anger at 
the U.S. government, insisting it should do something to stop it, 
although the film was privately produced. American officials have criticized it for intentionally offending Muslims.

Student Jawad Ahmed told Al Jazeera: 'Our policemen are not any better than the
Americans because they are trying to stop us. They are in the same 
league as them, they are heretics like them.

'They should allow us to demolish the American embassy because they have blasphemed against our holy Prophet. The police are also becoming an accomplice of blasphemers.'

Demonstrations raged across Pakistan in Lahore and in the Kashmir capital of Muzaffarabad where hundreds of people set fire to an effigy of President Obama.

Protests in Pakistan are expected to grow on Friday, the Islamic day of prayer which the government has also declared a day of national holiday. Nervous officials have blocked roads entering Islamabad.

Violence linked to the anti-Islam movie has left at least 30 people in seven 
countries dead, including the American ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens. Two people 
have died in protests in Pakistan.

Under attack: Several police officers were injured in the rallies in Islamabad

In recent days, the decision by a French satirical magazine to release cartoons crudely depicting the prophet has added to the tension, as may the upcoming issue of the German satirical magazine Titanic.

The magazine's co-editor Martin Sonneborn said it was up to readers to decide whether the cover of an Arab wielding a sword actually depicts the Prophet Muhammad.
