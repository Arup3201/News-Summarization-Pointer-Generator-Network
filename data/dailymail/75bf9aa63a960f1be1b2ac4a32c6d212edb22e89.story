From the stirring opening sequence to the wonderful art design, Darksiders 2 promises something special.

And although it improves on its predecessor in almost every way, sadly a host of minor issues stop this fantasy adventure from becoming a classic.

You play Death who is on a mission to clear his brother War's name for starting the Apocalypse early.

Masterful: The brilliant art direction gives the RPG a unique feel and look

Defying the Charred Council, he sets out across the Nether Realms - a haunting place between Heaven and Hell - to seek help from the beings who dwell there.

There's more than a slight nod to Zelda in Darksiders 2's dungeon-raiding design, which will see the campaign extend to well over 30 hours.

However, the game adds its own flavour to the mechanic by focusing on loot. Each dungeon has treasure chests which can be found to upgrade Death's appearance and weapons. There are thousands of items to collect - each having their own ability.

Unfortunately, the contents of each chest are completely unpredictable. You may dispatch a low-end enemy and get a powerful weapon, while defeat a hulking ice monster and get a pair of boots.

This can jar with the entire experience, and can take away the incentive of searching out the vast dungeons on offer.

Brutal: Weapons are plentiful in Darksiders 2, however, combat is repetitive

Combat is rather a middling affair, too. Although weapons range from swords, guns and dual scythes, it's all rather basic. You'll often find a simple yet effective combination, only to repeat it over and over again.

There's so much going in fights that it's very hard to see what is going on, many battles turning into a flurry of blood, gore and flying orbs. The combat also highlights Death's rather robotic animations.

A clever touch is his ability to transform into the Grim Reaper, which has devastating effects on enemies - but the bar takes so long to fill that it doesn't happen as much as you'd like.

There is a skill tree that allows you to upgrade weapons, armour and magic, but sadly this does nothing to stave off the repetitive combat.

Where Darksiders 2 shines, though, is in art direction. Joe Madureira from Marvel, has created a garish and ultimately convincing fantasy world, populated by memorable characters.

Environments range from sweeping snowy peaks to dense, vibrant woodland, the variation helping to encourage exploration.

Areas are populated by a host of very different NPCs - ranging from larger than life townsfolk, to sinister-looking ice monsters.

Wonderful: Death will meet some larger-than-life characters along his journey

It's a shame that Death moves through the environments so slowly. He can summon a steed and fast travel, but in areas where neither of these are possible, the absence of a sprint button is really felt - much more so than in its linear predecessor.

There's plenty to enjoy in Darksiders 2, and RPG fans will enjoy the level of exploration possible. Sadly, gameplay issues prevent it from being something truly special.
