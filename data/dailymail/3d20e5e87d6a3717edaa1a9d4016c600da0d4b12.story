Missing: Nick Stahl, the actor who played John Connor in Terminator 3, has been reported missing by his wife

The actor who played John Connor in 2003's Terminator 3 has been reported missing by his wife.

Roseann Stahl told police on Monday that her husband Nick, 32, has been unreachable for a week.

Mr Stahl has had a few run-ins with the law and TMZ reports that he has a history of drug use, leading some to fear he's found himself in terrible trouble.

Mrs Stahl, who is estranged from her movie star spouse, told the Los Angeles police that she last saw Mr Stahl on May 9.

The couple have a young daughter together, Marlo Stahl.

Sources told TMZ that the actor had been frequenting Los Angeles's Skid Row area and they're afraid he may be in over his head.

Earlier this year, his wife filed court documents that claimed Mr Stahl was abusing drugs and she was afraid for their daughter's safety. She demanded that his visitation with Marlo be limited to just 8 hours a week and that all visits be supervised.

She also wanted Mr Stahl to prove he wasn't abusing drugs around their child, asking that he present 'proof of a negative result for a test for drugs and alcohol within the 24 hours prior to his scheduled visitation time.'

Before he took on the task of becoming John Connor in 2003's Terminator sequel, Mr Stahl appeared in The Man Without A Face with Mel Gibson, Disturbing Behavior, and The Thin Red Line, which was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards.

He also appeared in the short-lived but beloved HBO series Carnivale.

Mr Stahl was arrested earlier this year on charges that he did not pay a taxi driver, after he allegedly could not cough up an $84 fare.

Cursed? Mr Stahl's turn for the worse echoes the fall of Edward Furlong, who played the part of John Connor in Terminator 2

According to TMZ, he spent an entire day in jail following his crime, so his $50 fine was suspended.

Mr Stahl's representative declined to comment on the actor's disappearance.

Mr Stahl's turn for the worse echoed the fall of Edward Furlong, who played the part of John Connor in Terminator 2.  

Furlong was found unconscious in 2001 of a suspected heroin overdose.

Furlong began his film career with a bang in 1991 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day and won an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Role.

He went on in the 1990s to star in films like American History X and Detroit Rock City.

But later Mr Furlong's public battle with substance abuse resulted in a few stints in rehab and a DUI arrest, also in 2001.

He was arrested for public intoxication in 2004.

His wife, whom he wed in 2006 and divorced in 2009, filed a restraining order against him in 2010, alleging that he repeatedly threatened her and was suicidal.

The pair has one son.

A third actor who played John Connor in the television series The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Thomas Dekker, also may have also succumbed to the 'John Connor curse.' 

Mr Dekker was arrested for a DUI in 2009 after he allegedly hit a 17-year-old bicyclist, according to TMZ.

Furlong was an overnight star after Terminator 2 was released, and won an MTV Award for his role. He was not offered the chance to reprise his role in the third film after well-publicized problems with drugs
