A marathon runner made a burglar realize he'd picked the wrong house when she chased him down ten blocks and caught him.

Sarah Tatterson, from West Seattle, was folding laundry when she spotted the man walking in to her open garage and walking out with her husband's bicycle.

The man, in his mid-50s, ran away with the bike down a side alley with Tatterson in hot pursuit.

Sarah Tatterson chased a burglar from her West Seattle home for ten blocks as he begged her to 'back off!'

Tatterson, a psychotherapist, trailed the man for ten blocks before police arrived to arrest him

The psychotherapist, who has completed a dozen half-marathons, decided not to tackle the man but ran after him screaming for neighbors to call 911.

The burglar ditched the bike at the alley's trash cans but Tatterson, who describes herself as 'borderline pacifist', carried on chasing him.

At one point he screamed at her to 'back off!'

She told the West Seattle blog: 'I explained that he should not have been in my garage. He told me his friend was now busy emptying out my house. I
explained his friend had great company to welcome him: the SPD.

'He was 
welcome to run as long and far as he wanted. I had planned on six miles 
today but could probably do 12 if need be.'

Tatterson told the burglar she only planned for a six mile run that day but was happy to do 12 if she needed to

The psychotherapist told a blog that she hoped restorative justice would be used for the thieving intruder

Police caught up with the chase ten 
blocks from Tatterson's house in the Admiral neighborhood and the man 
was taken into custody.

Tatterson said she was lucky the burglar did not have a weapon.

'It was on instinct, a primal instinct of justice really,' she told King 5 News.

'It's about safety. I want this neighborhood to be safe.'

The man ditched her husband's bike at the trash cans in this alley but Tatterson carried on the chase

Tatterson said her children would be amused that she left the garage door open

Tatterson joked that her children would love that it was her fault the garage door was open.

She told the West Seattle blog: 'Bike is safe, I am safe, the laundry is done.

'I canâ€™t say, though, what this will mean for the man who felt theft was 
his best option today. I do hope justice is restorative.'
