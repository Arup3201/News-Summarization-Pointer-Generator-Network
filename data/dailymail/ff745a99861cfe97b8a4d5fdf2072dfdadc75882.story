The lover of murderer Adrian Prout was visiting him in prison as police made the grim discovery of his spouse's remains.

Debbie Garlick went to visit fiancee Mr Prout at HMP Rye Hill, Warwickshire, on Thursday, moments before detectives found the body of strangled Kate Prout, 55, in rural Gloucestershire.

Ms Garlick, 40, who is the mother of Prout's 22-month-old daughter Evie, took their child along for the two-hour visit on Thursday.

Nightmare: Prout with fiancee, and mother of his child, Debbie Garlick shortly before his conviction. Before Prout confessed Ms Garlick campaigned to get his conviction overturned

According to The Sun, Ms Garlick remarked to police after being told of the discovery: 'Now her body's been found, it's real and has hit home.

'This isn't about me, it's about her and her loved ones who will now want to give her a rightful and proper burial.'

The discovery of Kate Prout's body came just days after Adrian Prout, 49, dramatically confessed to her murder in prison, over a year after he had been convicted of the crime.

Wedding day: The Prouts in 2000. His shock confession came four years after Mrs Prout, a retired schoolteacher mysteriously vanished

Last Monday he led officers to a secluded spot on the couple’s £1.6million country estate in Redmarley, Gloucestershire, and digging started.

Mr Prout admitted strangling his estranged spouse following a divorce settlement row.

Last week Ms Garlick, who had campaigned to prove Mr Prout's innocence, said he had fooled everyone.

Search: Police spent four days searching for the remains of Mrs Prout on the Gloucestershire farm she shared with her husband Adrian, who killed her in 2007

She said: ‘Now we know he fooled not only them but me, his own family and mine too by pretending he wasn’t involved in her death, I can only say sorry to them for the anguish he has put us all through.’

His admission from behind bars comes four years after he murdered his 55-year-old wife and exactly 12 months since her family last pleaded with him to reveal the truth.

Prout always denied any part in her 2007 disappearance as he refused to help officers in their search for the retired teacher.
