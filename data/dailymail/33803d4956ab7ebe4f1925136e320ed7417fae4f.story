A US Marine has been charged with the gruesome killing of a transgender Filipino who was found strangled to death with her head in a toilet bowl. 

'It's murder,' prosecutor Emily de los Santos told reporters after indicting Marine private Joseph Scott Pemberton, 19, with the death of Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey.

'It was aggravated by treachery, abuse of superior strength and cruelty,' she added about the October crime. 'You can see the kind of cruelty she endured, the injuries she sustained. We believe we have a strong case.'

Prosecutor Emily de los Santos said she believes that have a strong case against Pemberton. She added that the case was aggravated by treachery, abuse of superior strength and cruelty 

Pemberton is currently being held at a Filipino military camp in Manila where he was transferred in October from a US Navy ship. If convicted he could face up to 40-years behind bars

Eyewitnesses say Pemberton met Laude in a nightclub in Olongapo city, a port community northwest of Manila, where he had just finished taking part in joint US-Philippine military exercises. 

He didn't know she was transgender until they were got to cheap hotel room at the Celzone Lodge, according to an earlier report in the New York Daily News.

Laude was later found strangled to death, half naked, with her head in a toilet bowl, police said. She died from 'asphyxia by drowning', according to a police autopsy.

Pemberton will have to appear in court to face the charges, de los Santos said. She also urged Laude's loved ones, who had questioned whether he was still in the country, to attend court and see him for themselves.

Following formal charges by prosecutors, the local court which has jurisdiction over the case will decide whether there are enough grounds for the accused to stand trial, although there is no timetable for this process. 

Murder is punishable by up to 40 years in jail, but Pemberton has asked prosecutors to downgrade the charge to homicide, which carries a maximum 20 year prison term. 

The Laude family lawyer Harry Roque, welcomed the prosecutors' ruling and angrily demanded that Pemberton be thrown into an ordinary jail.

Protesters have taken to the street to demand justice for Laude. Her family's lawyer has demanded that Pemberton be thrown into an ordinary jail instead of being held at a military camp 

The case reignited a debate over custody of American military personnel accused of crimes. Another American Marine, Daniel Smith was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005

'This is not an ordinary murder,' he told reporters. 'This is heinous because she was beaten up.'

He is currently being held at the Philippine military's main camp in Manila. He was transferred from the US Navy ship Peleliu where he had been detained on board in October. 

The case reignited a debate over custody of American military personnel accused of crimes.

Philippine and US authorities engaged in a high-profile custody battle over another American Marine, Daniel Smith, who was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005. 

US marine Joseph Scott Pemberton could face up to 40 years in jail if he is convicted of murdering Jennifer Laude

Smith was held at the American Embassy in Manila until a Philippine appeals court overturned his conviction in 2009, allowing him to leave the country amid anti-US protests.

Under the Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows US forces to conduct combat drills in the country, the Philippines can prosecute American service members.

But the US has custody over them 'from the commission of the offence until completion of all judicial proceedings.' 

The Philippine Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2009 that convicted US military personnel must serve any sentence in Philippine detention.

Left-wing activists and nationalist Filipinos have cited the custody provision as proof that the accord was lopsided in favour of the US and undermines the sovereignty of the country, which was an American colony until 1946. 

In the latest case, US Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Locklear has ordered Pemberton's amphibious assault ship, which joined large-scale combat exercises with Filipino forces that ended Oct. 10, to stay in the Philippines until the investigation was completed. 

The US embassy had no immediate comment.
