Three witnesses spotted 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta casing security at Boston's Logan International Airport and reported his suspicious behavior to authorities - but airport security ignored the warnings and never questioned him, a shocking new report reveals

The witnesses have been identified for the first time by the New York Post after testifying in a lawsuit on behalf of the the families of the victims who died aboard American Airlines Flight 11 on September 11, 2001. 

Atta, a ringleader of the 9/11 attacks, was spotted filming the TSA security checkpoints at Logan on May 11, 2001. One of the witnesses, a veteran American Airlines technician, even confronted the al-Qaeda member and asked him what he was doing.

Surveillance video had not even been installed at the airport yet, so no video record exists of Atta's activities. 

Atta, who was a trained commercial pilot, and four other terrorists smuggled box cutters and pepper spray through the security at the airport in Portland, Maine,  on the morning of September 11 and flew to Boston. 

They then boarded American Airlines Flight 11 and overpowered the pilots and crashed the Boeing 767 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center - the first attack against the Twin Towers.

All 92 people aboard the plane were killed and hundreds of people at the Trade Center died in the crash and subsequent collapse of the building.

Stephen J. Wallace revealed in testimony that he saw two Arabs, including one matching Atta's description, conspicuously filming a security checkpoint at Logan about 25 feet away while talking loudly in Arabic, according to the Post. 

This went on for 45 minutes, Mr Wallace told a court. He said he contacted security, but police never responded. 

'I said, specifically, "These two clowns are up to something. They’ve been taking videos and pictures down at the main checkpoint,"' he testified, according to the Post

Finally, Mr Wallace confronted Atta - who had a set of brand-new pilot luggage. He said he asked the two men whether they had any prohibited items in their bags. They swore at him in Arabic, then boarded an American Airlines flight to Washington Dulles International Airport. 

Theresa Spagnuolo, an American Airlines passenger screener, and her supervisor James Miller Jr. also noticed the men and reported them to authorities. They were told that police could do nothing about Atta's behavior, they later testified. 

The Post reports that even pre-9/11 laws could have allowed authorities to stop and question Atta. 

'I’m convinced that had action been taken after the sighting of Atta, the 9/11 attacks, at least at Logan, could have been deterred,' Brian Sullivan, a former FAA special agent, told the newspaper. 

Atta flew Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing all 92 people aboard. Thousands more died in the towers and after the subsequent collapse
