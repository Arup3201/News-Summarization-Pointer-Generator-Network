Arsene Wenger has revealed a heart-to-heart with Aaron Ramsey helped trigger the midfielder’s explosive rise last season.

Wenger admitted for the first time that he shied away from playing the Welshman at the Emirates Stadium towards the end of the 2012-13 season due to abuse he was receiving from Gunners fans.

In an attempt to eradicate the problem, Wenger called a meeting with the troubled player.

And the talks proved a masterstroke, with Ramsey — who scored Arsenal’s winner in last season’s FA Cup final — now established as the club’s premier central midfielder.

Wenger said: ‘I sat down with Aaron and I told him, “I don’t think people don’t like you, but they don’t like your game at the moment”.

‘He had to come back to a more simple game... then you saw a different player, because he is intelligent, and when I came out of the meeting I knew this guy would come back.’
