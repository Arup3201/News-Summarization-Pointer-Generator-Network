A decorator has painstakingly recreated his former home to help his wife in her battle with dementia.

Matt Muircroft recently moved back to Scotland with wife Julie, 75, after she was diagnosed with the illness.

The couple had lived in Berkshire for 30 years but returned to their home town of Motherwell, Lanarkshire, to be closer to their family.

Matt Muircroft was worried that his wife, Julie, would be upset by moving from her normal surroundings when they moved house. So, he decorated their new flat in exactly the same way as their old one. Image shows the couple in their old flat before Mrs Muircroft's illness

When Mr Muircroft, 75, was told that any big changes in surroundings can cause anxiety in dementia sufferers he set about making the interior of their new flat an exact replica of their old one.

During his career, Mr Muircroft worked in Windsor Castle and decorated St George’s Chapel in the grounds of the castle for the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999.

However, the father-of-six told how his most recent makeover was the most important job of his life.

He said: ‘Julie was diagnosed with dementia in 2009 and we moved back to Motherwell in May to be near our close family for extra support.

‘We have also received great support and advice from the charity Alzheimer Scotland.

‘One of the things we were told initially was that big changes in surroundings can create confusion and anxiety if someone is affected by dementia.

‘I had a long, hard think about what I could do to make the transition as seamless as possible for Julie.

‘It seemed like one of the most obvious things to do would be to use the skills of my trade to help.’

Mr Muircroft even placed the couple's photographs and ornaments in the same position as they occupied in their old flat

From colour scheme to skirting, fireplace to fittings, the decor of the flat has been painstaking replicated from their former home, also a flat.

He also placed ornaments and family photographs in the exact same position as they were in the couple’s previous home.

Mr Muircroft said: ‘Recreating the 
interior has really helped Julie settle and without a doubt it’s been 
the most important job of my life.

‘Caring
 for Julie and helping her cope with the changes the condition has 
brought, by doing anything I can, has become my sole focus.’

Arlene Crocket, of Alzheimer Scotland, 
said: ‘To move to a new environment can be very unsettling for some 
people affected by dementia and can sometimes exacerbate confusion.

‘That’s why having as much familiarly as possible in a new environment is really important. Items like ornaments, photographs and paintings from a previous setting can help in many cases.

‘What Matt has done, by making the new flat almost identical to his last home, really is a moving example of someone going the extra-mile for a loved one.’

Alzheimer Scotland, which are continuing to help Mr Muircroft care for his wife by offering advice and support, are playing a key role in the nationwide Reshaping Care for Older People (RCOP) programme.

RCOP aims to help growing numbers of older people over 65 to continue to live full, positive and independent lives in the community.

RCOP partners in Lanarkshire, who also include NHS Lanarkshire, North and South Lanarkshire Council the voluntary and independent sector, are also focussed on recognising and supporting unpaid carers, like Mr Muircroft.
