Friendly chatter among colleagues can easily become chatter among, well,everyone when news reporters forget to turn off their microphones after reporting live.

That's what happened in the California KTLA 5 news room Friday when traffic presenter Ginger Chan forgot to turn off her microphone thus declaring to the newsroom -- and everyone listening -- that her colleague Sam Rubin is fat.

Embarrassed: KTLA 5 reporter Ginger Chan looks shocked in embarassment after she realizes she forgot to turn off her microphone before calling news anchor, Sam Rubin, fat

News room: The newsroom erupted in laughter, inluding Rubin, leading Chan to recognize her mistake, she then frantically turned off her microphone 

Rubin, was sharing a story with colleagues on air about a time his wife asked him 'when did you become the fat guy on that show?' referring to his participation in the KTLA 5 morning news.  

In a moment that took everyone by surprise, Chan replied, from another room, 'he's always been!' 

The newsroom erupted in laughter leading Chan to recognize her mistake.

Hiding:  Chan laughed and hid her face from the camera, which switched back to her after her slip-up, as she continued laughing

 Colleagues: Chan's jabb seemed to be all in good fun as Rubin laughed along with his colleagues

Good Sport: In a post on his Facebook page, Rubin described the incident as a 'very honest; and very funny moment'

In embarrassment, she immediately turned off her microphone, took off her headphones, and hid her face from the camera, which had immediately switch back to show her following her 'dis' to Rubin. 

Chan's jab seemed to be a funny joke as Rubin laughed along with his colleagues. The station also didn't think too deeply into the incident.

In a post on the station's Facebook page, station officials wrote 'Accidents happen, and that’s why our anchors are supposed to turn off their microphones when not on camera...Sorry, Sam Rubin. We think you look great.'

Rubin was a good sport as well, in a post on his Facebook page, he described the incident as a 'very honest; and very funny moment.' He also wrote that he did not mind that Chan's joke was at his expense. 

I guess the dissing and banter is all in good fun at the KTLA news room. 

However, this isn't the only incident where KTLA 5 was in the public eye for something other than reporting.

 In February, Rubin himself was the one embarrassed when he mistook actor Samuel L. Jackson for Laurence Fishburne during a live interiew.
