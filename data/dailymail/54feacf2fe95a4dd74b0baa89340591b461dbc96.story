A suspected child sex abuse gang has been smashed by police officers as part of a crackdown on exploitation of young girls.

Eleven people have been arrested under Operation Heliodor in the south Manchester area, Greater Manchester Police said.

The suspected abusers, aged between 19 and 38, have been arrested for alleged offences including sexual activity with a child, attempted indecent assault, inciting child prostitution, abduction and rape.

None of the men have been charged and all have been released on bail until November and December. 

The arrests come at a time of increased scrutiny over the way police forces, including Greater Manchester, deal with child sexual exploitation allegations in the wake of damning reports and claims widespread abuse  was effectively ignored by officers for years.

Detective Inspector Debbie Oakes of the Greater Manchester Police's Protect Team said: 'Tackling child sexual exploitation and those responsible for such heinous crimes is an absolute priority for us. 

'We listen to the children and put them at the heart of our investigations and tactics, to ensure their safety and well-being is at the forefront of everything we do.

'Operation Heliodor is ongoing and, with this collaborative approach we will continue to target those involved in child sexual exploitation. I fully anticipate more warrants and arrests as we continue in our investigation.'

The arrests come after an MP  criticised Greater Manchester Police for failing to tackle grooming gangs.

Labour's Simon Danczuk claimed Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy did not see the issue as a priority and urged him to do more.

The arrests come after MP Simon Danczuk criticised Greater Manchester Police for its handling of child sex abuse cases. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy has insisted the force has 'completely changed' since a child sex ring operated in Rochdale

The MP for Rochdale made the comments after an ITV News report said hundreds of child abusers were free to walk Manchester's streets because the force had failed to investigate allegations properly.

The force was heavily criticised in 2012 after nine men were jailed for over a long-running child sex ring in Rochdale.

Speaking earlier this month, Sir Peter Fahy admitted the force was focused on other types of crime at the time of the Rochdale offences, but insisted it has now 'completely changed'.

He told the BBC: 'Unfortunately there was this big emphasis, particularly around big cities, about trying to improve in the league tables.

'But that is no excuse whatsoever for the fact that a mindset had developed, not only in the police but also in social services and in the Crown Prosecution Service, that this issue of children running away from homes could not be solved.

'We now have multi-agency teams in places like Rochdale. It's not only about investigating the matter and prosecuting the offender, but crucially to try and protect the young person from being involved in more abuse.'

Commenting on the latest arrests, Lynn Perry, regional director for Barnardo's said: 'We are pleased to be at the heart of an inter-agency partnership in Greater Manchester tackling child sexual exploitation; supporting and enabling young people to speak out and providing child victims of sexual exploitation with appropriate, long term support.'
