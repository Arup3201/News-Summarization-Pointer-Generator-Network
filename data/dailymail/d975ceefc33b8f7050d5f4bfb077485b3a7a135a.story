Warning: Ofcom said in a scathing report it was very concerned about Royal Mail's performance

Royal Mail is failing to deliver the post on time to a third of Britain’s postcodes, despite charging more than ever for a first-class stamp, the industry watchdog said yesterday.

Ofcom said in a scathing report it was ‘very concerned’ about the company’s performance and threatened to impose multi-million-pound fines unless drastic improvements were made.

Royal Mail’s failure is particularly shocking because the report covers the year from April 2012, the month when the price of a first-class stamp jumped from 46p to 60p.

Brian Binley, a Tory MP on the Commons Business Select Committee, which is investigating Royal Mail’s controversial privatisation, said: ‘The British public is simply not getting the service it needs.

‘If there was ever an argument for an injection of new management into Royal Mail, it is this report.’ In each of the country’s 121 postcode areas, 91.5 per cent of first-class letters are meant to be delivered the next working day.

But Royal Mail only manages to meet this target in 73 areas, equal to just 62 per cent of the total.

Because of difficulties in delivering post the extreme weather, the Hebrides, the Orkneys and the Shetland Islands are not included in the target.

As a result, the post arrives later than it should in 45 areas as widespread as Oldham, Stevenage, Brighton, Stoke-on-Trent, Tonbridge and many parts of London.

Ofcom’s report revealed:

Ofcom warned: ‘We are very concerned about these failures. In particular, we note the poor and highly variable performance of the postcode area targets.’

Interrogation: The report comes just days before MPs are to quiz Business Secretary Vince Cable about the recent privatisation

It will now monitor Royal Mail’s service and says it will launch a formal investigation if targets are not met. This could result in ‘enforcement action’ and ‘financial penalties’ of up to 10 per cent of postal revenue.

Mike O’Connor, chief executive of the watchdog Consumer Futures, said: ‘Consumers want a reliable postal service and they need to know they are getting what they pay for, especially given the number of price rises over successive years.

‘Ofcom’s analysis clearly shows that Royal Mail is falling short in this respect with no clear reason for these failures.’

Ofcom points out that the  91.5 per cent target is crucial because it ‘ensures Royal Mail provides a good level of service across the UK, not just in more densely populated areas’.

But Royal Mail’s performance has actually deteriorated since it increased its prices.

During the financial year 2011/2012, when a first-class stamp cost just 46p, the target was met in 97 postcode areas.

Ian Murray, Labour’s postal affairs spokesman, said Royal Mail ‘must do better and take appropriate steps to make sure targets are met in future.’

He added: ‘Given that Royal Mail is no longer in public ownership after the Government’s fire sale, it is crucial that we don’t see a shift in focus away from service delivery to maximising shareholder value leading to a poorer service.’

Ofcom’s report comes just days before MPs are to quiz Business Secretary Vince Cable, Business Minister Michael Fallon, and Lazards, the investment bank that advised the Government about the recent privatisation.

The biggest controversy surrounds the pricing of the shares at just £3.30 each, with many critics claiming they were undervalued. Last night, they were priced at £5.39 when the markets closed.

A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘We were disappointed that we didn’t meet all of the regulatory quality of service targets we were required to last year. This remains a key area of focus for us.

‘Royal Mail has the highest service specification of any major European country and we take our service performance very seriously.’

Royal Mail made an extra £435million from handling letters, parcels and other mail in the last financial year, a rise largely fuelled by last year’s price increases.

@highlight

The number of letters and large letters sent fell by 1.2billion compared with the previous year, but the amount of money made by delivering them increased by £106million, thanks again to higher prices.

@highlight

Of the 1.4billion first-class letters sent last year, excluding bulk business mail, 117million letters missed the delivery target.

In a survey, 30 per cent of people said they were ‘fairly or very dissatisfied’ with the cost of postage.
