Mr Brightside: Brandon Flowers, singer of The Killers was not always this steady on stage

With a new Christmas single, an appearance on tomorrow’s X Factor Final and their first hits collection, The Killers are marking the tenth anniversary of their debut British gig with their customary swagger.

The Las Vegas rockers, fronted by  Brandon Flowers, have sold 22 million albums and headlined at Glastonbury, Wembley and even the White House.

But the ride has not always been smooth. Early hits like Mr Brightside were universally lauded, but the band’s second album, 2006’s Sam’s Town, was initially mauled by critics and fans alike — and Brandon was badly stung.

‘I struggled with that response,’ 
Flowers admits. ‘I had felt compelled to show something of where I come 
from — smalltown America — and the Press destroyed me for it.

‘I
 made the mistake of believing the bad reviews. They convinced me I was 
just a pop tart who didn’t belong in  the realm of serious rock artists.

'Our  following album, Day & Age, was a total reaction to Sam’s 
Town.’ 

The singer 
is more philosophical these days. And rightly so.

The new retrospective,
 Direct Hits, draws material from all four of their studio albums, with 
the Bruce Springsteen-esque guitars of the Sam’s Town numbers sitting 
seamlessly alongside poppier, synth-powered tracks.

‘I’m
 happy we’ve finally released a hits album,’ says the 32-year-old, who 
formed The Killers with guitarist Dave Keuning in 2001.

‘I grew up with 
“best-of” cassettes. My first Smiths record was Hatful Of Hollow and I 
had hits albums by Elton John and The Cars.’

Chatting
 ahead of The X Factor Final, which also features Elton, Katy Perry and 
One Direction,  Brandon says he is now more at ease with himself than in
 the past.

‘On our first UK tour, I was still wondering whether I was good enough to do this,’ he admits. ‘Our first gig was in a pub, The Dublin Castle in Camden Town, and I was so nervous that I fell offstage during Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine.

‘There had been a lot of hoopla beforehand about us being the  next big thing, so it was very embarrassing.’ The new assurance stems partly from a settled home life in Las Vegas. Since marrying childhood sweetheart Tana Mundkowsky eight years ago, Brandon has become the proud father of three sons.

A devout Mormon, he avoids  alcohol and drugs. ‘I used to drink. And smoke. But, as you get older, and have a wife and children, the dynamic starts to change,’ he says. ‘The drinking is fun when it starts, but it doesn’t always end that way.

‘I live a normal life. But I’m always thinking about what I’m going to do next, musically. Do I need a fresh producer? What was Peter Gabriel doing when he was 32?’

Originally influenced by British acts like The Cure and New Order — Brandon was once praised for his ‘genuine fake English accent’ — The Killers have since sought inspiration closer to home, working alongside Lou Reed and Springsteen.

Having collaborated with Reed on Tranquilize, the opening track on the 2007 rarities album Sawdust, Flowers was saddened to hear of the rock pioneer’s death.

‘Spending time with Lou was surreal because of the folklore that surrounds him,’ he says. ‘We were scared to death, but he was sweet, and great to work with. The night he died, we played a show in Las Vegas and sang Pale Blue Eyes in tribute.’

The Springsteen liaison came about at a rock festival in Holland. ‘We were playing Mr Brightside when I saw Bruce really going for it at the side of the stage. That was like some weird dream. He suggested I join him onstage later for Thunder Road, and I jumped at the chance. That song is part of my DNA.’

Beyond the hits CD — and  Christmas In LA, the Killers’ eighth festive charity single — the band will take a breather. Brandon is working on a solo album, but he assures me that he will return to the group when the time is right.

‘This is the end of something,’ he says. ‘Maybe we have become too comfortable. I’ll do my solo stuff and then come back to give The Killers a kick in the pants.’

Direct Hits is out on Island.
