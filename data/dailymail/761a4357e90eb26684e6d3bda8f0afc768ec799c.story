Boris Johnson tonight accepted a challenge from Pippa Middleton to a table tennis showdown to prove who is from the most competitive family.

The socialite and author threw down the gauntlet to the London Mayor, boasting of her prowess as an under-13 competitor in national competitions.

The contest will pit the Middletons and Johnsons, both with claims to being close to the Royals, against each other in a game of what Boris likes to call 'whiff-whaff'.

Head to head: Boris Johnson and Pippa playing a game of table tennis, as imagined by Carla Millar for the Spectator, to decide once and for all whose is the most competitive family

Pippa boasted that she once played in national Under-13 table tennis championships, warning the London Mayor: 'Bring it on Boris'

Fresh from competing in a cross-country ski marathon on the slopes of St Mortiz, Pippa revealed she hopes her next big sporting challenge will be taking on Boris at table tennis, declaring: ‘Bring it on Boris.’

And her prowess is not to be doubted – Pippa boasts that she once competed at national level, albeit more than 15 years ago.

Boris took to Twitter tonight to declare:  'I’m game if she is. Happy for Pippa to join me on a visit and see the benefits of our £22m Sports Legacy Fund in action.'

No-one would doubt the ambitions of either family with close links to the British royals.

Boris is a descendant of King George II while Pippa was propelled to global fame when she was bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Kate to Prince William.

It catapulted the middle-class Middletons into the social stratosphere, with parents Carole and Michael rubbing shoulders with the Queen and Prince Charles.

Pippa claims that her family is even more competitive than the Johnsons and believes the only way to put it to the test is a game of table tennis. 

Pippa will be hoping for a better outcome in the table tennis game than in her recent attempt to complete a ski marathon in St Moritz, which had to be aborted because of bad weather and the threat of avalanches

Writing in tomorrow’s Spectator magazine, she says that having returned from her Alpine challenges she hopes to ‘pursue less demanding hobbies in my spare time, such as ping-pong’.

Pippa adds: ‘I’m informed that Boris Johnson, former editor of this magazine, wants to be ‘whiff-whaff’ world king even more than he wants to be Prime Minister.

‘I’m also told the Johnsons are almost as competitive as the Middletons. So I’d like to lay down a challenge to the Mayor.

‘My only stipulation is that I can use my favourite Dunlop Blackstorm Nemesis bat, which I used when I played in the Milton Keynes U13 National Championships, don’t you know. Bring it on, Boris.’

The image of the pair playing on a blue table was mocked up for the magazine by artist Carla Millar.

After Mr Johnson accepted the challenge, Spectator editor Fraser Nelson said: 'We'll get a ping pong table set up in the Spectator's garden.'

And he warned the Mayor: 'She's quite serious. And sporty.'

Pippa will be hoping that her latest sporting trial will have a better outcome than her attempt to take part in the 45th Engadin Ski Marathon 2013 race in St Mortiz.

In her Spectator diary she reveals how she was weighed down by her rucksack, filled her gloves with snow and put her crampons on wrong.

Her 'strikingly handsome' guide Matthieu exclaimed at her incompetence: 'It is a ******* joke, Pippa.'

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister has been signed up as a columnist by Waitrose magazine, but readers have complained her first offering - an Asian feast- was difficult to prepare

She and Boris have more in common than ties to the Royal Family. Both are high profile columnists, Boris earning a reported £250,000-a-year from the Daily Telegraph while Pippa was recently signed up as a recipe writer for Waitrose magazine.

Her ascent from party planner to professional foodie came after her first book - a guide to party-planning, which did include several recipes - bombed in October last year.

Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities For Families and Friends reportedly netted Pippa a £400,000 advance from publisher Michael Joseph. 

But her agent David Godwin last month confirmed that he and the middle child of the Middleton family were no longer working together.

Boris has made no secret of his love of 
table tennis, causing a diplomatic row when he claimed at the Beijing 
Olympics that the game originated not in China as many thought but on 
the dining tables of 19th century England.

The London Mayor revealed to a global audience his love of table tennis at the Beijing Olympics, declaring the sort was 'coming home'

At an event to mark the official handover of the 2012 to London, he declared: 'Ping pong is coming home. All sports were either invented or codified by the British. Even ping pong was invented on the dining tables of England and it was called wiff waff.

'When the French look at a dining table, they saw an opportunity to eat. When the English look at a dining table, they saw an opportunity for whiff waff.'
