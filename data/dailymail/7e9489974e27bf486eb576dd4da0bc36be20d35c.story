You remain as young as you feel – and it is just as well…

Our healthier lifestyles and better medicine are helping more of us than ever live past the age of 100.

For the first time, the number of centenarians in Britain has passed the 13,000 mark.

Official statistics released yesterday show that 13,350 of us were aged 100 or more when the latest figures were collected in 2012.

Of these, 660 were at least 105 years old – which is another record. And there are now half a million people in Britain aged 90 or more.

The number of centenarians has risen by 73 per cent in the last decade alone.

And life expectancy for the next generation is also rising.

A newborn girl can expect to live to the age of 82.6, and a boy to 78.7 – almost six years longer for a girl and eight years longer for a boy than at the beginning of the 1980s.

Just before the First World War, there were only 100 centenarians in the whole of Britain. When  King George V sent out the  first congratulatory telegrams  to centenarians in 1917, there  were only 24.

Now Buckingham Palace is sending out around 10,000 laser-printed royal 100th birthday cards a year.

Those who were aged 100 or more in 2012 are certainly hardy – to  get to this age they faced many perilous challenges in their  early years.

They survived the First World War, the deadly 1919 flu epidemic, the high mortality rates of the 1920s and 1930s and then the Second World War. The increase in numbers living into great old age began in the 1950s and has accelerated in recent years.

The analysis by the ONS found: ‘The chance of surviving to older ages has increased for both males and females over recent decades, contributing to the rising numbers of those aged 90 and over in  the population.

‘Mortality rates at older ages have improved due to a combination of factors such as improved medical treatments, housing and living standards, nutrition and changes  in the population’s smoking  habits.’  People are living longest  in England, where life expectancy for boys born now is 79 and for women it is 82.8. Scotland still  has the lowest life expectancy in the UK, at 76.5 for a boy and 80.7 for a girl.

In Wales life expectancy for newborns is 78.1 for boys and 82.1 for girls, while in Northern Ireland it is 77.7 for boys and 82.1 for girls.

Yesterday’s statistics also showed the average amount of years we spend in good health, based on a self-assessment in the 2011 national census. Judging by respondents’ answers on the state of their health at that time, it was estimated that a newborn girl can expect to spend 64.8 years in good health, while for baby boys it is 63.5 years.

But there are major regional differences between expectancies of good health. In Guildford and  in Waverley in Surrey, baby girls can expect to enjoy 71.3 years  in good health, while for boys it is 70.3 years. But in Bradford a healthy life expectancy for a man  is just 52.5 years and 51.6 years  for women.

Janet Morrison, of the charity Independent Age, said: ‘The stunning 73 per cent increase in the number of centenarians is a massive cause for celebration.

‘It is particularly good news for older men – there are far more men aged 90 or over than ten years ago, and women over 90 now outnumber men by just 2.5 to 1, compared to 3.3 to 1 ten years ago. These trends are expected to continue – it is estimated that half the five-year-olds alive today will live to 100.

‘Yet, we are woefully under-prepared to meet the challenges – and indeed seize the opportunities –presented by population ageing.

‘Urgent action is needed in health and social care, in work, in lifestyles and in our attitudes if we are to adjust to an ageing society.’

The life expectancy of men is gradually catching up with that of women, the Office for National Statistics figures show.

The narrowing of the gap between men and women is in line with the decline of heavy industry and manual labour, which means fewer men work in dangerous physical jobs.

Also, more women are exposed to the stress of holding down careers and more are likely to indulge in risky behaviour such as heavy drinking.

een life expectancy for men and women was six years in the early 1980s, but has narrowed to 3.9 years. The ONS said that ‘males are demonstrating faster improvements’ in their lifespans than women. 

A recent indicator suggesting there may be growing pressure on the health of women showed that mortality rates have failed to improve for some working women aged between 25 and 59.

The professions affected included women working in sales, as counter clerks, clerical grade workers in local government and the public sector, medical and dental technicians, and some creative industries such as graphic designers.
