Care: Mothers who devote their time to raising their children at the expense of their career must not be penlaised, says the Bishop of Exeter

Stay-at-home mothers are being unfairly penalised for their ‘principled decision’ not to go out to work, a bishop said last night.

The Bishop of Exeter added to growing criticism of the Government’s failure to support mothers who sacrifice their professional lives to look after their children.

Describing stay-at-home mothers as ‘the glue which enables us to be a healthy society’, the Rt Rev Michael Langrish said his views were shared by a number of bishops.

The bishop, who sits in the House of Lords, told the Daily Telegraph the biggest impact of the Government’s policies is on traditional families in ‘middle England’.

He said: ‘The concern for me is for those who have made a principled decision to stay at home and taken the financial hit. It is actually unfair and against the Government’s own rhetoric.

‘Where one parent makes a conscious decision to stay at home for the children … they shouldn’t be penalised.

‘The evidence is that what the parent is doing is investing in a child’s development which can save the state significant amounts of money at a later stage.

‘It helps children to develop into adults who are more likely to fulfil their potential and make a net contribution to society.’

The Government has received marked criticism after the removing child benefit from wealthier families with one breadwinner, restricting financial help to those mothers returning to work, and repeatedly delaying tax breaks for married couples.

The bishop, a father-of-three with four grandchildren, said he remained ‘eternally grateful’ to his own parents for the fact that he always found one of them at home when he came back from school.

‘We hear a great deal of talk about ‘Broken Britain’ and here we have families making a deliberate choice to make their contribution to the glue which enables us to be a healthy society,’ he said.

‘There’s a lot of research which shows getting parenting right in those early years has a positive impact on health, on education and on social behaviour,’ the bishop added.

The bishop says the Government must do more to support mothers who dedicate themselves entirely to family

‘We hear a lot from the Government about support for this and yet that rhetoric does not seem to be translated into public policy.

‘I have a general concern that we’ve had a lot of rhetoric about the support for family life and good parenting.

If the rhetoric had substance I would expect that to be reflected in public policy decisions.’

The bishop also defended parents who feel they have no choice but to stay home because of their belief in family life.

He said child benefit tax changes had been based on an assumption that families had chosen the one-earner option ‘as a luxury,’ adding: ‘In many cases, it doesn’t feel like that.

'It feels like something you have to do if you are truly committed to that network of relationships that help to make for a healthy society.’
