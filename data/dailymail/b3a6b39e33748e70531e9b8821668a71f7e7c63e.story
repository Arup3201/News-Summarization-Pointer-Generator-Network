QPR chairman Tony Fernandes has taken to Twitter to try and appease disgruntled supporters after his club were left bottom of the Premier League table following their 2-0 defeat to West Ham.

After tweeting that the performance of Harry Redknapp's side at Upton Park was 'just not good enough' on Sunday evening, the Malaysian billionaire returned to his social media account to partly explain - and also question why - the club have managed just one win all season.

Fernandes was quick to point out that the Hoops bounced back immediately from their relegation to the Championship in 2013 by securing promotion via the play-offs in May.

But he insisted that the west London side faced a struggle to assemble a competitive squad during the summer after allowing so many players to leave the club on temporary deals during their year in the second tier.

Fernandes wrote: 'We have always been on the backfoot with players. We had so many loans last year as we cleared out.

'That's it. There should be no more excuses from anyone especially me. Buck stops at me. I'm up for the battle.'

Redknapp is under pressure to turn around the club's fortunes but it appears he will be given time to do so after Fernandes mentioned his decision to sack Mark Hughes in November 2012 and QPR's subsequent relegation.

'Is sacking the answer. When we met (sic) Mark Hughes go we still went down. Is it tactics ,is it players ,is it coaching ,is it fitness,' he added.

The 50-year-old was particularly upset with criticism from fans who have suggested the club's failure to replace Loic Remy - who joined Chelsea just before the summer transfer deadline - was to blame for their poor form so far. 

Fernandes tweeted: 'When we lost Remy 48 hours before deadline day it was huge huge blow. Huge blow. But we fight on. Stop sendind (sic) me ridiculous tweets.

'I'm not stupid or a quitter. All I can assure fans is as always we will be transparent and leave no stone unturned to stay up and build.

'I love the Remy comments. Remy was staying, he was in my house for dinner to sign the extension. Then Chelsea called. What back up pls (sic).

'Yeah I can pull out a striker in 24 hours. We tried hard with (Fabio) Borini. So pls (sic) tell me me what you would have done. Dammed easy to be arm chair critics.'

QPR lost their fifth Premier League game of the campaign against Sam Allardyce's side and have just four points from seven games so far.

Fernandes added: 'I don't think the players didn't try yeatersay(sic).

'Look at the stats. The goal was never a goal. Took the wind out of us. The second goal was against the run of play. No excuses. We still should have dine (sic) better.'
