As the only royal godparent the pressure was on Zara Tindall yesterday.

And the 32-year-old seemed to take inspiration from Victoria Beckham's maternity wardrobe as she arrived at St James's Palace wearing a simple navy coat and matching headpiece.

Whilst most of the group, including Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Pippa Middleton and Kate herself chose pale colours for the christening, pregnant Zara draped her growing bump in chic navy.

Victoria Beckham wore a similar outfit for the Royal Wedding in April 2011 when she was pregnant with daughter Harper.

Zara appeared to take inspiration from Victoria Beckham's maternity wardobe: the designer wore a flowing knee-length dress for the Royal Wedding in April 2011

Zara was one of the first to arrive at the chapel, holding hands with her rugby player husband Mike Tindall.

The horsewoman looked chic in a knee-length navy coat and dress by one of the Queen's favourite designers Stewart Parvin,

She finished the look with a boxy turquoise clutch bag, a pair of simple court shoes and a £518 hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan.

The Middleton sisters both chose to wear cream for the historic occasion, with Pippa opting for a 'trapeze' coat and 'Paris' dress by British designer, Suzannah.

The cream wool coat costs £750. She teamed her outfit with a jaunty hat and carried a peach clutch bag.

Proud mother Kate chose a ruffled cream design by Alexander McQueen, the label behind her 2011 wedding dress.

Zara 
is the only member of the royal family to be godparent, while Kate's old
 schoolfriend Emilia Jardine-Paterson and family friend William van 
Cutsem have both been asked to take on the role.

The
 other godparents are the couple's university friend Oliver Baker, 
William and Harry's Private Secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, the Duke 
of Westminster's son Hugh Grosvenor, and Julia Samuel, an old friend of 
Princess Diana's.

The seven godparents, announced this 
morning, show how the Cambridges have dispensed with the tradition of 
picking other royals and foreign dignitaries, choosing instead close 
friends to guide their first-born son.

The Cambridge's have broken with royal protocol by not holding the christening at Buckingham Palace

Prince George is the first eventual heir to the throne to be christened in 31 years

Prince William and his wife Kate leave with their son Prince George of Cambridge following his Christening by the Archbishop of Canterbury

The christening itself is set to be a intimate affair and the godparents and their spouses will make up a crowd of only 24 people attending the 3pm service.

As well as ignoring protocol by only inviting five senior royals, the Cambridge's have also broken from tradition by not having their son christened at Buckingham Palace.

Instead the future king will be carried and blessed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, in the little known Chapel Royal at St James's Palace yesterday afternoon.

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married there in 1840, and George will be christened in a replica of the intricate lace and satin christening gown made for Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841.

Mrs Jardine-Paterson was at 
Marlborough with Kate and is said to have introduced Kate to William's 
circles at university.  She is reportedly advising the Cambridges on the
 interior design as they renovate their apartment at Kensington Palace.

William
 van Cutsem is one of William's oldest friends and his late father, 
Hugh, was a close friend of the Prince of Wales.  Educated at 
Ampleforth, Mr van Cutsem is a Catholic.

Oliver Baker, 31, was at St Andrew's University with the Cambridges and they lived together for their final two years.

 William van Cutsem, an old family friend of Prince William's and Kate's schoolfriend Emilia Jardine-Paterson have been asked

Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, whose son 
William, 10, was a pageboy at the royal wedding, has been an important 
figure in William's life since he was appointed private secretary in 
2005.  A former equerry to the Queen Mother, he is married with four 
children, he lives in Suffolk.

Hugh, Earl Grosvenor, is son and heir of
 the Duke of Westminster, one of Britain's richest people, and aged just
 22, he will be Prince George's youngest godparent.

Emilia Jardine-Paterson, whose maiden name was 
d'Erlanger and who comes from Tiverton in Devon, has known Prince 
William since she was 19 and Kate for even longer having also attended 
private school Marlborough College with her.

She and the Duchess are extremely close, and they went to Ibiza together when the now-married couple split-up in 2007.

Oliver Baker (l) went to St Andrew's University with the couple and former SAS Major Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton is a trusted aide of Prince William since 2005
