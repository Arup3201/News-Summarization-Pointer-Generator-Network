For the first time, James Ashby - the man who filed sexual harassment claims against Peter Slipper two years - has personally detailed the allegations he brought against his former employer.

During his first week on the $160,000 job as Mr Slipper's adviser in 2010, Mr Ashby was asked to stay with the then-MP in his Canberra home.

The gay Sunshine Coast man said he was not surprised by the invitation as others before him had been asked the same question.

James Ashby - the man at the centre of the Peter Slipper scandal - has spoken for the first time about his claims against the former speaker

The 35-year-old accepted the offer but within two days he became 'uncomfortable' with staying there after Mr Slipper allegedly asked his employee to massage his sore neck.

'He was in pair of boxers, he laid down on his bed - stomach down - and I stood beside the bed and massaged just his neck,' Mr Ashby told 60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes.

'It was during that time he started with a moan that could only be described as sexual.

'And I felt uncomfortable and just said: "You're done", and I walked out of the room.'

But the next day it escalated with Mr Ashby claiming the former speaker questioned why he showered with the door closed.

He said Mr Slipper called him a 'prude' for not admitting the practice was abnormal.

Mr Ashby said his employer 'made a point' of showering with the door open the next day after this exchange.

During his time as Mr Slipper's advisor, Mr Ashby allegedly continued to be harassed by the former speaker, including through text messages.

Once Mr Slipper wrote: 'If u [sic] interested we could be closer?'

But Mr Ashby replied with: 'I think we're good already'.

Despite the reception he received from his adviser, Mr Slipper kept pressing him - at one point texting: U want something more? U brilliant at massages'.

This is when Mr Slipper dropped his friendliness and started excluding Mr Ashby from work functions and asked to be contacted through his parliamentary adviser, Tim Knapp.

But Mr Ashby claims the harassment continued, with Mr Slipper one day asking personal questions about his sex life that left him shocked, saying: 'We were lucky we didn't run off the road.'

Mr Slipper has always denied the allegations and the case against him was initially thrown out by the Federal Court but it was then re-instated.

Earlier this year, Mr Ashby announced he would dropping the allegations against Mr Slipper as he did not want to cause the 64-year-old any more mental health issues.

Despite continued denials from all members of the LNP - including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Mr Ashby also alleged during the interview that he had sought advice from Queensland MP Wyatt Roy and Education Minister Christopher Pyne.

He claims he had conversations with both politicians about his sexual harassment case.

Mr Slipper has since been found guilty of misusing Commonwealth funds to visit Canberra wineries

During the interview, Mr Ashby also broke down in tears when he recalled an incident where he contemplated suicide

Mr Ashby said during his conversation with Christopher Pyne, the senior Liberal figure had offered to pay for a lawyer and promised him a job could always be found for him.

But when the time came for Mr Ashby to leave he said he was told by Mr Pyne that if he ever revealed to anyone they had spoken he would label the former staffer a 'pathological liar'.

These alleged offers made by Mr Pyne were then withdrawn, Mr Ashby said.

In a statement, Mr Pyne moved to distance himself from the matter, claiming he nor any other member of the government are in no way involved.

'All these matters have been aired over and over again for the last three years,' Mr Pyne said.

'Mr Slipper has been found guilty of fraud against the taxpayer.'

'Mr Ashby settled a sexual harassment case with the Commonwealth.

'I had no specific knowledge of the allegations made by Mr Ashby and the first I knew that he was suing Mr Slipper was when I read it in the newspapers.

'This is a dispute between two individuals - not a dispute that includes me or any other member of the government.'

Mr Roy was contacted by 60 Minutes but the program said he declined to comment on the matter.

Mr Ashby also sought out counsel from Mal Brough - the MP who now occupies the Queensland seat Mr Slipper once held 

Mr Ashby also claims the woman - known as Jackie - who helped him organise a lawyer in his case against Mr Slipper was in fact Queensland MP and  the former speaker's Liberal Party colleague Mal Brough.

In a text message exchange with his colleague Karen Doane, Mr Ashby refers to Jackie who would be able to find them new jobs as he was in a position of power.

'I’d received a phone message...it said "contact Jackie" and I rung the number...a woman answered the phone and I said "Oh hi, is Jackie there?" and she said "I'll put him on",' Mr Ashby told 60 Minutes.

'Before I knew it, Mal Brough picked up the phone.'

But Mr Brough has denied the allegations.

'I'm Jackie? That explains why no one ever knew who Jackie was,' he said.

'The only lawyer I organised was David [Russell QC] who met him once.'

Mr Ashby - who is now a graphic designer on the Sunshine Coast - said he also contemplated suicide after the sexual harassment claims came to light.

He was on the verge of tears as he recalled an incident where he had lined himself up to collide with a truck while he driving to Yeppoon - a coastal town in Queensland.

'Couldn't do it. I couldn't do it to Mum,' Mr Ashby said.
