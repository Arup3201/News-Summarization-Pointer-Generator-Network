Controversial: Anthony Seldon says that Michael Gove is wrong and that children need longer school holidays

Michael Gove said this week that he wants to see shorter school holidays and longer school days. The long summer holiday, he believes, is the product of a 19th Century agricultural economy and has no place in the 21st Century.

He wants pupils to compete with Asia, where students work harder and longer. As always, Gove is right in intent but  imperfect in execution.

I so admire the Education Secretary’s guts and zeal. Every week this pugilist force of nature comes up with a pronouncement which delights or enrages the country.

The BBC would be much duller if it wasn’t devoting hours of its output talking about the latest Gove-ism.

This weekend sees people slugging it out on each side of the ‘holiday and hard work’ debate.

But he is plain wrong to think he will improve schools or the lot of children by shortening holidays. He wants more school time and less home time, because he thinks pupils will work harder and exam results will improve, with holiday time en masse given over to lessons.

I am all in favour of longer school days, which would also help working parents, but not for the reasons Gove advocates. Children need extra time in school to experience enrichment in the arts, sport and character education.

Too much time in class and pupils switch off,  or they become too tired for homework – a key part of the discipline of learning.

As a headmaster I know it is counterproductive for students to spend more than five hours a day in lessons.

Exam results have improved massively in the schools I’ve run, not because I have extended time in lessons, but because of better teaching and smarter learning. This is where Gove should focus.

So we need longer school days, but, in the state sector, longer holidays, too.

It is shortening school holidays which harks back to the 19th  Century. Great school lessons are available at home on computers and students benefit from independent study – both of which can be done in the holidays.

Holidays benefit parents and teachers, too. Improved results come from teachers who are highly motivated.

Play time: Anthony Seldon believes that time away from school benefits children and staff

A major incentive to join the profession is the prospect of a six-week summer holiday in state schools, as well as two weeks at Christmas and Easter.

Most teachers don’t squander this time, but use it to enrich their minds, travel, read, attend courses, and simply to relax. They deserve it.

Gove’s change would undermine the fabric of family life. The opportunities holidays provide for the young – to explore, go on visits and attend activities – are invaluable.

More purposeful pursuits should be available for children during the holidays.

The Education Secretary  greatly admires independent schools, which achieve results far outstripping state schools in Britain, and indeed the schools in the Far East and in Scandinavia which he so admires. But we do so with much longer holidays than state schools enjoy.

Reforms: Michael Gove wants to cut school holidays

At Wellington College we have 19 weeks of holidays, compared to 13 in state schools, which Gove wants to cut still further.

And why on earth are we trying to emulate Asia anyway?

When this country’s economy led the world in the 19th century, we did not do so by copying anyone else.

Here again, Gove is drawing the wrong lessons from this time. Delve into it deeper and you find that Asian schools are dull, dull, dull – it is why their governments are looking to Britain’s best schools.

That’s why we should start leading the world with our education, and learn from our best independent and state schools, rather than merely trying to follow others and spending vast amounts of public money on jaunts studying schools abroad.

For me, the school holiday debate sets major alarm bells ringing. If Michael Gove doesn’t start listening soon, he will put his achievements in education policy since 2010 in jeopardy.

The week of Baroness Thatcher’s funeral provides a historical perspective from which Michael Gove can learn.

I worry that he is only listening to an-ever narrowing circle of those who tell him what he wants to hear. Thatcher fell into that same trap and look what happened to her.

Gove is the greatest success story of the coalition Government. He is driven by a profound passion to enhance educational opportunities for all pupils, regardless of social class and the schools in which they learn.

He believes children have lost out because policy has been driven in the interests of education providers – the teachers, university education departments, the administrators and local authorities – rather than the children themselves. He is right, and his campaign is magnificent in its ambition.

Lady Thatcher was one of Gove’s heroes, and more than any other cabinet minister in this Government, he is driven by a Thatcherite determination to drive his policy through, confront vested interests and defeat them.

Like Lady Thatcher, he has taken on the unions and they are resisting, threatening strikes and mayhem. But Gove will not stop until he has consigned them to history, as Thatcher did Scargill and the National Union of Mineworkers.

Long breaks: Wellington College has 19 weeks of holidays, compared to 13 in state schools, which Gove wants to cut still further

He has built on Lady Thatcher’s work with her introduction of the national curriculum. He believes rigour and scholarship have been sucked out of many schools.

Too many teachers, he believes, patronise children by underestimating their academic depths.

‘La-la subjects’ take precedence over real ones, such as modern languages, maths and physics. Each child must have a solid core of factual knowledge.

He has gone further than Lady Thatcher in working to bring outstanding young people into the profession and taking on failing schools.

All work and no play: Mr Seldon thinks that pupils switch off if they are in class too long

He is moving teacher training out of universities and into schools, and is working to encourage the brightest and best undergraduates to become teachers.

Thatcher took the academically strongest children out of state schools and put them in independent schools with her ‘assisted places’ scheme. This demoralised state schools.

Gove instead wants to affirm the state sector, but to make schools more independent of local authorities by them becoming ‘academies’ or ‘free schools’.

Thatcher would have applauded, even though she dared not make this move.

I support and admire all these efforts. But if Gove wins an A* for his objectives and effort, he achieves a B/C for execution.

He wants to remain Education Secretary for all five years of this Government to embed changes which the next government would never dare undo.

But to embed change, you need to carry people with you. Many of his supporters feel bruised and confused by his pace of change and by the lack of clarity.

Many parents, teachers and heads are on your side, Michael. Don’t spurn us. Thatcher learned  from her predecessor, Ted Heath, that you have to introduce change step-by-step.

Praise heads and teachers more, and don’t fight on all fronts. Let those who want to run extra courses in the holidays do so, but don’t impose shorter holidays on the whole system.

My advice is a long summer holiday this August: you’ll see the value.
