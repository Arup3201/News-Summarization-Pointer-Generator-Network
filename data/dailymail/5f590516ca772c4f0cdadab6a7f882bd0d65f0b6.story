Former England captain Michael Vaughan has admitted he was wrong to suggest Alastair Cook should be replaced as the leader of the national side.

Vaughan was one of a number of former England captains turned media pundits to criticise Cook in the wake of the humbling defeat to India at Lord's in the second Investec Test.

Vaughan, who led England to Ashes glory in 2005, believed Cook should have been stood down as captain and given a six-month break from cricket in order to feel refreshed for a busy schedule next year.

But with England bouncing back from their setback to win at the Ageas Bowl and Emirates Old Trafford and go 2-1 up in the series, Vaughan has retracted his comments.

'No question, I was wrong,' said Vaughan on BBC Radio 5 live's the Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show.

'Two and a half weeks ago, I said a break would've done him good.

'But the England and Wales Cricket Board stood by him, he was strong and said: "I'm the man to carry this young team forward.''

Cook responded to questions over his form with knocks of 95 and 70 not out in Southampton.

However, he was given a major let-off in his first innings when he was put down on 15 by Ravindra Jadeja, a reprieve that Vaughan thinks altered the momentum in the five-Test series.

Vaughan said: 'I think that one catch is the real twist of the whole series.

'If Jadeja had caught Cook on 15, I really felt at that time, it would've been a disaster for the side.'
