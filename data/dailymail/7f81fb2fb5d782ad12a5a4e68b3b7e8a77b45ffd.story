Two thousand foreign hikers have been trapped in bad weather on the slopes of a mountain near Mount Everest in a remote corner of Nepal for the past four days, it was revealed last night.

The trekkers, who are thought to include a number of Britons, been forced to stay in the small hill resort of Lukla, the gateway to Mount Everest.

Lukla, which sits 2,800metres (9,186ft) above sea level, has been covered by thick cloud this week, forcing airlines to cancel flights to and from the remote region. It is located 78miles (125km) north-east of the Nepalese capital.

Tens of thousands of trekkers and climbers visit the Solukhumbu region, home to Mount Everest, each year. Many start and end their trek from the windswept resort where a small airstrip is carved into the rugged mountainside.

Utsav Raj Kharel, chief of Lukla's Tenzing Hillary Airport, said tourists, who were not in physical danger, had been waiting for their flights back to Kathmandu for the past four days.

Mr Kharel said: 'Visibility is almost nil. Fog and clouds have covered the entire area making flights by fixed-wing small aircraft impossible.'

Weather officials in Kathmandu said the clouds could continue to cover the region for a couple of days, worsening the plight of the trapped tourists who could face a food shortage.

Mr Kharel said: 'Though a few small private helicopters had picked some tourists from nearby Sirke village, they are inadequate to clear the rush.'

Santa Subba, chief of the Himalayan Rescue Association Nepal, said authorities were expected to make arrangements to rescue the trapped hikers in big helicopters once the weather conditions allowed them to reach the area.

Autumn, which runs from September to November, is peak tourist season in South Asia's poorest but scenic country, which gets nearly 4 per cent of its gross domestic product from tourism.
