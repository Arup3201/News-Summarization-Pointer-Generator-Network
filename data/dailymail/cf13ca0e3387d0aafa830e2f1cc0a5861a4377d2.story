Senator Ted Cruz blasted President Barack Obama on Wednesday for '76 instances of lawlessness and other abuses of power,' in a wide-ranging speech that drew comparisons with Richard Nixon, lashed out at the administration's 'obstruction of justice' on Benghazi and reached its peak with a quote from the cult-classic film 'The Princess Bride.'

The Texas tea party darling recalled hearing Obama tell Fox News host Bill O'Reilly during a Super Bowl Sunday interview that there is 'not a smidgen of corruption' related to the Internal Revenue Service's practice of targeting conservative nonprofit groups because of their political beliefs.

''My first thought was of my favorite movie, "The Princess Bride",' Cruz said of the president's use of 'smidgen.'

'"You keep using that word",' he recalled a character Broadway star Mandy Patinkin saying. '"I do not think it means what you think it means".'

Deadly serious, with a smidgen of silly: Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz unveiled his fourth 'Abuse of Power' report on the Obama administration at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., but couldn't help cracking a few jokes

In the Princess Bride, it was Vizzini (L) saying 'Inconceivable!' to Inigo Montoya (R); and with President Obama, says Ted Cruz, it's 'not a "smidgen" of corruption' -- to which comes the same reply 'You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means'

Cruz released the fourth edition of his 'Abuses of Power' report during a Washington, D.C. conference hosted by the right-wing Federalist Society.

Speaking of what he sees as the Obama administration's activism that falls outside the boundaries of federal law, he claimed that 'if the same acts had been committed by Richard Nixon, every day the headlines in newspapers would be banner headlines.'

'And yet,' he said, 'you don't have that level of scrutiny.'

Most lawmakers, Cruz said, claim to be in favor of enforcing federal laws as they are written, but many Democrats and some news outlets reflexively come to Obama's defense because 'he's on our team.'

'There is not presently in the United States Congress an "anti-Rule-of-Law" caucus,' he fumed, 'but give it time.'

Cruz's complaints ran the gamut from the IRS, drug laws and immigration reform to offshore drilling, gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act.

Ted Cruz's speech to the Federalist Society covered a wide swath of territory, offering judgments on a variety of what he sees as legal presidential missteps:

Benghazi: A recently revealed White House memo said the administration's 'goal was to declare that whatever happened here, it was not the fault of any policy from this administration. In the criminal world, that used to be called obstruction of justice. And yet here it's treated like just another feature of politics.'

Immigration: President Obama 'suddenly announced [that] some 800,000 people who are here illegally – he was unilaterally granting them amnesty. Never mind that Article II [of the U.S. Constitution] gives the president a duty to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed".'

Gay marriage: Cruz blasted the president for siding with gay marriage advocates in Utah by choosing not to enforce the law, saying that his administration 'decided it's going to recognize marriages that Utah law doesn't allow and federal law doesn't allow.'

Recess appointments: He complained that Obama has gone around the Senate to appoint officials by determining on his own when the legislators are in 'recess,' joking that 'tonight, I'm pretty confident that a lot of senators are going to go home and go to sleep,' and the if president has that power he 'can appoint whoever he wants.' 

'Take Obamacare,' he said at one point. 'Please! Take Obamacare!'

'If you wanted to come up with an example of lawlessness, it would be difficult to come up with a better example,' Cruz claimed.

He cited a half-dozen examples of the White House 'illegally' ignoring the text of the president's health insurance overhaul law to score political points and keep the new system afloat.

The administration first offered waivers for certain business groups 'in a blog post by an assistant treasury secretary, put up right around the Fourth of July,' he recalled.

Cruz also complained about a secretive meeting between the president and congressional Democrats that resulted in broad Obamacare exemptions on Capitol Hill.

An amendment to the Affordable Care Act, first sponsored by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, ensured that members of Congress would have to participate in the Obamacare insurance exchanges.

But Cruz alleged that the White House 'had a closed door meeting between Harry Reid, the Senate Democrats, and Obama, where they suddenly realized "Hey, we don't want to be on Obamacare".'

Days later, new exemption options emerged for federal lawmakers and their staffs.

A third episode he cited came after more than 6 million Americans lost their medical insurance as Obamacare's implementation loomed in the waning months of 2013.

'We needed to get together and fix this,' Cruz said. 'We needed to do something to provide relief for those Americans we've hurt.'

'The president didn't do that. Instead he held a press conference ... where he instructed private insurance companies to go ahead and break violate the law, [saying], "By presidential grace and whim, I'm telling you to do so".'

Lawgiver: Cruz said President Obama has been 'telling private individuals and private companies to violate the law'

Cruz lambasted Obama on Wednesday for 'illegally' changing federal law to suit him

'We have 
never had an instance where the President of the United State instructs 
private citizens and private companies to go ahead and violate the 
law,'the senator claimed.

The White House did not respond to a request for a reply to Cruz's stinging charges.

But the senator alleged that 'when you have a president who can pick and choose which laws to follow and which laws to ignore, then you no longer have a president.'

He also joked about the likelihood that the federal government will soon toss aside some drug laws that tend to earn offenders long sentences.

'The brownies outside were provided by the state of Colorado,' he chuckled, 'so if my remarks today appear in Technicolor, perhaps it will render it more enjoyable.'

Cruz, who is expected to run for president in 2016, told reporters after his speech that he would pledge to be just as hard on future occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, even if they're from his own party.

'Whoever the president is – Republican or Democrat,' he said, 'if he or she disregards the rule of law [and] disregards the Constitution, you can be certain that I will speak out every bit as vigorously against lawlessness by a subsequent president.

Asked if a strict interpretation of laws would also apply to a hypothetical Cruz administration, he fell silent and then spoke slowly: 'Regardless of who the president is.'
