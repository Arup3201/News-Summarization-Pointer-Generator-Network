Erik Lamela hopes his Europa League wondergoal can breathe life into his Tottenham career.

The Argentine hit a breathtaking Rabona goal from 20 yards in the 5-1 win over Asteras Tripolis on Thursday.

It was without doubt the highlight of Lamela's 14 month White Hart Lane career so far.

Lamela celebrates after his wondergoal against Asteras Tripolis at White Hart Lane on Thursday night 

The Argentinian hopes the goal, which he says is the best of his life, will kick-start his Tottenham career

The South American has failed to hit the heights expected of him since his club record £30million arrival from Roma last summer.

But he hopes his brilliantly executed strike can be the catalyst for bigger and better things.

'Was it the best goal of my life? Yes, I think so. I think so.

'I’ve scored like that before, when I was playing in the junior sides at River Plate. It just happened in a flash.

'I wasn’t thinking about doing something like that, I just wanted to score and it was the most effective, comfortable way of making it happen.

The 22-year-old has had a slow start to his Tottenham career since his £30million move from Roma in 2013

'It’s something I’ll always remember because it’s something different from the other goals I’ve scored.

'The goal can help me show my best here. It was important for me but also because I needed to score, any type of goal.

'I’m happy for the goal and the win. I hope to continue in this way but it’s just one game for me. I need to think about doing other things well and continuing to improve.'
