Lloyds Bank has pledged that 40 per cent of its top jobs will be occupied by women by the end of the decade.

In an unprecedented announcement, the company committed to filling 2,000 of its 5,000 most senior roles with women by 2020.

It is the first major company in Britain to set such a gender quota.

British firms are under pressure to increase the number of women in senior roles, amid criticism many never reach the top once leaving their careers to have children.

Lloyds Bank will become the first to set a gender quota when it commits to filling 2,000 of its 5,000 most senior roles with women by 2020

Critics say this leaves the upper echelons of corporate Britain a male-dominated world.

Currently only four of the FTSE 100 companies have female chief executives.

But Lloyds boss António Horta-Osório will tomorrow officially set out plans for a quota inside the company.

In a speech at the London Stock Exchange he will say that Lloyds ‘will commit to better represent the diversity of its customer base and its communities at all levels of the group’.

Of the 5,000 most senior positions, 40per cent must be filled by women by 2020, he will say.

Senior managers, human resources directors and anyone running a group of regional branches will be counted as having a ‘senior’ role.

Currently only 28per cent of such jobs are done by women, meaning the bank will have to appoint around 600 women in the next six years - a rate of around two a week.

Fiona Cannon, diversity director at the bank, said the target was ‘stretching but achievable’.

She added: ‘There is a whole body of research suggesting that where organisations have a diverse senior management team they are much more financially successful than those that do not.’

In the speech Mr Horta-Osório will also announce a package of measures designed to rebuild trust in the bank, which has been hit by a string of scandals including PPI misselling and rigging market lending rates.

He will pledge to boost small business lending by £1billion this year and will commit to giving £100million to charities by 2020.

The government is trying to increase the number of women in Britain’s boardrooms.

It has told FTSE 100 companies to commit to having a quarter of their directors as women by next year, and has appointed former trade minister Lord Davies to oversee the process.

Since the initiative was launched, the proportion of women in boardroom positions has risen by 12per cent to 20per cent.

The 12-member board of Lloyds Bank has three women sitting on it - although all three of the board’s ‘executive’ positions are occupied by men.

Business secretary Vince Cable, who will attend tomorrow’s speech, said: ‘All the evidence we have suggests that companies which do make use of the female labour force do very well at the top end.

‘We need to make sure that becomes standard practice in the UK.’

He added: ‘We are not tapping into the talents of half the population. If we are going to get proper balanced representation in companies, it has got to start with senior executives.’
