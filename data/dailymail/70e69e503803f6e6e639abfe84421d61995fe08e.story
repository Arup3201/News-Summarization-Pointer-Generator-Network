A desperate father whose little girl died after he left her in a hot car by accident in 2010 has spoken out to warn other parents from making the same tragic mistake.

'This pain can sometimes pull you right to your knees with no warning,' Reggie McKinnon said on Tuesday, describing the scars left following the death of his 17-month-old daughter Payton Lyn.

'It's still a question that remains unanswered: how did I forget my child?'

McKinnon, who lives in Cape Coral, Florida, had taken Payton to an appointment on that fateful March day four years ago, then strapped her back into her car seat and went to work as a supervisor at Centurylink, forgetting he hadn't returned her.

He was chatting to co-workers on his way to his car where he made the awful discovery that his daughter was dead in the back seat.

'Just don't think it can't happen to you,' McKinnon said at an event at the Children's Services Council of Palm Beach County on Tuesday.Â 

'Because I can't go back on that day. And I would do anything if I could change places with her, but that's not possible.'

He said he has vowed to raise awareness to save the lives of other babies.

'I made a promise to my sweet Payton Lyn that I would do everything I could to prevent this horror from ever happening to another innocent child,' he said, according to the Sun Sentinel.

Florida is second only to Texas in the number of children killed by heat stroke while trapped in the back seat of a car, according to a study by San Francisco University.

Since 1998, at least 68 kids in Florida and 623 nationwide have died that way, according to non-profit Safe Kids Worldwide.

This year already there have been two Florida deaths and 17 nation-wide.

'Heatstroke deaths can happen any time, anywhere to anyone,' said Kate Carr, president and CEO of Safe Kids Worldwide, according to the Sentinel. 'We don't want to see this happen to anyone.'

Officials suggest parents put an iPhone or one of their shoes in the back seat to help jolt their memories.
