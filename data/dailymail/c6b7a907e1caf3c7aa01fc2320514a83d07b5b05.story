An 83-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer who was left with horrific injuries after 'pure scum' burglars stormed her home and attacked her was beaten so badly that her family feared she was dead. 

Zallu Hassan suffered severe facial injuries including a broken cheekbone and jaw and a fractured eye socket after the gang stormed her home in Ilford, Essex.

Her devastated daughter, Tulay Ahmadi, 46, believes the intruders kicked her mother's head and stamped on her face during the attack overnight on March 9.

Mrs Ahmadi, who raised the alarm after arriving at her mother's house and finding her in a pool of blood, is now offering a £10,000 reward for anyone who has information leading to the arrest of the offenders.

She said: 'The people who did this are pure scum.

'They're so evil they'd probably do this to their own mothers.'

'My poor mum was so bad that we thought she was dead when we saw the blood coming out of her ears.'

Mrs Hassan, who lives on her own, was attacked sometime between 6pm on March 9 and 8am the following morning.

Mrs Ahmadi said the family are now trying to establish what was stolen as the house was ransacked but her mother has 'nothing of real value' and nothing obvious is missing.

She said: 'They're just animals - any human being who has any kind of respect would not do this.

'If I could I would inflict the same pain onto them 10 times over. It's just horrific.

'She was upstairs in her bedroom when we found her there covered in blood.'

Mrs Hassan, who has short-term memory loss, is now in a stable condition at Queen's Hospital, Romford.

Mrs Ahmadi said: 'My mum was very mobile but I feel this has definitely advanced her Alzheimer's - she's become very reclusive since she was attacked.

'If someone knows something they should come forward - it could have been their mother lying with terrible injuries in a hospital bed.'

'I won't rest until I find out who did this.'

'The house had been ransacked.

'The victim is currently in a stable condition at an east London hospital where she is undergoing treatment.'

Detective Sergeant Jim Casey, of the Met Police, added: 'This was a vicious and cowardly attack on a vulnerable elderly lady.

'I would appeal for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious on Eastern Avenue near to the junction of Ashurst Drive to come forward.'
