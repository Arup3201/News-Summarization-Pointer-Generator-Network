Focusing on sporting success is a waste of time because 'very, very few children' are going to make it, an academic has said.

Ellis Cashmore, a professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University, says there is little proof that the Olympic Games create any kind of meaningful sporting legacy.

And he believes it is high time parents realised children are more likely to make the finals of shows like The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent than become sporting heroes of any sort.

'We shouldn’t be trying to channel all of our energy into this pursuit of excellence in sports when very, very few children are going to succeed at any kind of level at all,' he said.

'My answer to parents who tell me their child might become a leading footballer or athlete is that they are putting them at risk of serious injury or closer to the world of performance-enhancing drugs.

'I ask them: "Are you happy about that?" and they say: "It won’t happen to my child".

'To which I reply: "But it goes with the territory". The cheats are very often those at the top.

'Do we want to churn out one-dimensional characters who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of excellence?'

Prof Cashmore is also concerned that the behaviour of elite sportsmen is filtering down to grass roots.

'Schools are now trying to apply an industrial model instead of encouraging children to enjoy sport without being competitive,' he said.

'At football matches, parents treat their children like interns in a concentration camp.

'I feel like saying to them: "Your son is trying to enjoy himself, by the way!".' 

Prof Cashmore, who has written books about David Beckham and Mike Tyson, reveals he once fancied himself as a middle distance runner with Birchfield Harriers – until he realised he 'wasn’t very good’.

He played football until he was 40, has tried ice rinks but not skiing, and believes in sport as a useful means of recreation.

But he added: 'Elite sportsmen are terrifyingly narrow, often unable to talk about anything else except their sport.

'I just used to try. I was an honest trier, a toiler.'

Britain’s
 Winter Olympics success, he argues, is such a flash in the pan that it 
will have no effect on the nation’s youth whatsover.

'You
 could stop 100 people in the street and ask them to name any of the 
competitors. You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who could,' he said.

'The
 level of awareness of the Winter Olympics is zero and nobody was in the
 slightest bit interested. 'Even if you asked 1,000 people, probably 
only two or three of could name anyone.

Because these were not games for ordinary people.

Prof Cashmore also poured scorn on Lord Coe's 'Olympic legacies'

'So why do we spend all of this money training people to do something we are not very good at? “Is there anybody out there who wants so much taxpayer’s money spent on sports that will only be enjoyed by a tiny minority of a minority?'

After studying the Winter Olympics medal table – Russia got 33 (13 of them gold), Norway 26 (11), Canada 25 (10), U.S. 28 (9), Netherlands 24 (8), Germany 19 (8), Switzerland 11 (6) and Great Britain 4 (1) – Prof Cashmore added: 'How did we get to the point that one gold, one silver and two bronzes is somehow a success when we are just not very good at winter games? 

'The medals table proves the Winter Olympics is for affluent countries – and where are the black athletes? 

'In six months time people will have forgotten all about curling. They won’t even know what it means.'Then there was the huge cost of covering something that I, and many others, didn’t watch a single minute of.

Prof Cashmore also poured scorn on Lord Coe’s ‘Olympic legacies’.

'Over the years that word has mutated from meaning rejuvenating slums, new facilities and hospitals to creating more sportsmen,' he explained.

'The only increased take-up of a sport after London 2012 has been women’s boxing, so there’s a lot of people who find all of that a bit ambivalent.

'The newspapers and television were bigging up the Winter Olympics, but I didn’t hear anyone on the street talking about them.'

The National Child Measurement Programme recently showed that 33 per cent of pupils aged 10 to11 in 2012-13 were obese or overweight, and 22 per cent of children in reception classes were overweight.
