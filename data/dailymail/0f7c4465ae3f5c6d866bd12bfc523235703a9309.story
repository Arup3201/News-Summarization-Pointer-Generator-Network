A mother has spoken of her horror after discovering her fiancé had sex with the teenage lodger she had taken under her wing - in a graveyard.

Adele McCormack, from Bradford, broke down in tears  after a lie detector test revealed that her partner, David Dutton, had cheated on her twice with 18-year-old Charlie James who had been living with them.

The 41-year-old was told that David had a tryst with the teenager in a  forest near their home and another time at the city's Undercliffe Cemetery close to where his own father was buried.

Adele said she had been enjoying a 'perfect' relationship with David Dutton, who she had met five years ago through mutual friends, and they had quickly fallen in love. 

She said at first she had been put off by the 13-year age gap between herself and David, now 28, but she had quickly fallen for her toyboy's charms and her life felt complete when, two-and-a-half years later, he proposed at an all-you-can-eat buffet at a Chinese restaurant.

She said: 'It was so romantic. Everyone there started applauding when I accepted, and when I got home I began preparing for our big day right away.

'I thought we had a great relationship. We were at it like rabbits in the sack.'

However, their fairytale romance was shaken to the core after Charlie was welcomed into the family's Bradford home.

'One night in the pub I bumped into a local girl called Charlie.'I knew her vaguely through a friend of David’s and I noticed she seemed upset,' said Adele.

'We got chatting and she told me things had been strained at home, so I insisted that she lived at mine.'

Initially, David was uncomfortable with the new lodger, calling his fiancé’s generosity, “typical.”

'I set up the spare room and cooked her hearty meals, bought her clothes. I even got her a job at a local call centre,' said Adele, whose 19-year-old daughter, Opal, was 'thrilled' to have another teenager in the house.

'It was Opal who first noticed how Charlie acted around David, all flirty and girly,' added Adele.

'She’d always follow him around and cuddle up to him on the sofa. One day she even offered to go to the shops with him and I grew suspicious.'

Adele was so suspicious that she logged onto her fiancé’s Facebook account to see if the pair had been swapping secret messages - and they had.

'I clicked on a message from Charlie and felt like I’d been kicked in the stomach,' she said.

“Charlie had written, "I like you, do you like me?" and David had replied "Yes, I do!" it was sickening.'

Distraught, Adele threw both her fiancé and her lodger of just a month out of her house.

She said David returned the next day, but Charlie never stayed at the house again.

'David was adamant he’d got nothing to hide, but friends told me Charlie was going around telling all and sundry that she’d been sleeping with my fiancé.

'There were even rumours that they’d done the deed in the graveyard near my house.'

Determined to clear his name, David offered to go on The Jeremy Kyle Show TV show and take a lie-detector test to prove his innocence.

'I rang the show and booked David in for the test,' she said.

'The producers also contacted Charlie and she also agreed to go on.

'But as days went by I started to believe David was telling the truth. He was so sure that he’d done nothing wrong.

'I started to think that maybe Charlie had been stirring up trouble.'

However, Adele's gut instinct had been right, and it was while appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show that she learned David had cheated on her with Charlie after he failed the lie-detector test.

The  results revealed that David had intercourse with Charlie on two separate occasions, once in the graveyard and another time in a forest.

Adele said: 'Back home David refused to leave. He kept saying, "I’ll make it up to you no matter what it takes."

'I thought it was too little, too late,' Adele recalled. 'He had humiliated me in front of millions of people.'

However, once back at home, Adele said she started to see things differently and she is now standing by her man having forgiven David. 

'I was so angry, but he started doing things around the house, and I slowly started to forgive him. It’s Charlie who is to blame, she's a homewrecker.

'That girl used my kindness as a weakness and pounced on my man in my own home.

“I treated her like a daughter. And how did she repay me? By sleeping with David in a graveyard. It’s unforgiveable.'

Adele said she and David are still engaged and undergoing relationship counselling.

'Nothing can stop true love, not even Charlie.'

David said that he did not think the lie detector test would catch him out, which is why he had volunteered to go on to The Jeremy Kyle Show. 

'I love Adele but I hold my hands up, I made a mistake,' he said. 

'I'm going to make it work with Adele. I'm doing the washing up and little things to help her out. I need her to trust me again.'

Appearing on the TV show, Charlie told host Jeremy Kyle that 'it all happened'.  

She said: 'Adele had read the Facebook messages he’d been sending me. She confronted him then threw him out, then she confronted me and threw me out.

'I had no idea where I was going. I walked round with David that’s when I ended up sleeping with him.

'He really made me feel like he loved me. The second time he came and met me, we had sex outside again In basically like a forest.

'I know what I did was wrong, and I’ve owned up to it.'
