Few visions could capture the overwhelming human cost of the First World War quite so well.

A sea of blood-red ceramic poppies flows out of the Tower of London and into the dry moat – one flower to represent every life lost.

The installation, to be officially unveiled tomorrow, has been created to mark 100 years since the day Britain went to war with Germany in 1914.

The work of artist Paul Cummins and 
titled Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, it will eventually include 
888,246 poppies, representing all the British or colonial military 
fatalities in the war.

It 
will grow over the summer, and the last poppy will be planted on 
November 11, symbolically marking the end of the First World War.

The idea of the display is to provide an 'inspiring setting for learning activities' that can be viewed from the Tower, and a 'location for personal reflection'.

From tomorrow, each poppy will be available to buy for £25, with proceeds shared among military charities.

It is just one of the commemorations taking place across the country in remembrance of those who died in those terrible years.

Today,
 households, businesses and public buildings all over the country are 
being asked to turn out their lights for an hour at 10pm.

Those
 taking part will leave a single light or candle burning to commemorate 
the moment prime minister Herbert Asquith declared Britain was at war at
 11pm.

The plan is inspired 
by the words of Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary, who, just before
 war was declared, said: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe; we 
shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’

Meanwhile,
 more than a million poppies were fired into the air today to remember 
every person from Britain and its colonies who died fighting.

One
 hundred years to the day since Britain entered the Great War a 
spectacular 'poppy explosion' was held at Bovington Tank Museum in 
Dorset.

It was followed by a
 mock battle involving members of the Great War Society group who 
dressed as the 4th Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment.

At 11pm on August 4, 1914, Britain declared war on Germany, ushering in four years of appalling tragedy.

Before
 the armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, millions of lives were 
lost, including more than 750,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers.
