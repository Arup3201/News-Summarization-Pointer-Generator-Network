The long-running Dominique Strauss-Kahn saga could come to an end today as his lawyers are set to appear in court alongside the hotel maid who claims he sexually assaulted her.

The two sides are expected to announce that they have reached a financial settlement which could run into millions of dollars in return for Nafissatou Diallo dropping her civil lawsuit against the former head of the International Monetary Fund.

The court date comes less than two weeks after it was widely reported that the pair had negotiated a settlement after months of haggling.

Conclusion? Dominique Strauss-Kahn has allegedly reached a settlement with hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo

Troubles: The scandal ended Strauss-Kahn's presidential ambitions and wrecked his public reputation

However, a source said details of the settlement are not likely to be made public at the hearing, which is scheduled to begin at 2pm EST (7pm GMT) on Monday in New York State Supreme Court in the Bronx.

The agreement would end a legal saga that began when Diallo, 33, told police that Strauss-Kahn attacked her in his suite at the Sofitel Hotel in Manhattan on May 14, 2011.

The scandal forced Strauss-Kahn to resign his post as head of one of the world's most influential finance organisations and wrecked his hopes of running for president in his native France.

Relief: Strauss-Kahn will doubtless be pleased to bring an end to his long-running legal battle

Prosecutors initially expressed confidence in the evidence, including DNA that showed a sexual encounter.

But they dropped the case in August 2011 after developing concerns about Diallo's credibility, including what they said were inconsistencies in her account of what happened immediately following the incident.

She filed the lawsuit just weeks before the charges were dismissed, claiming he forced her to perform oral sex and caused her physical and emotional damage.

Strauss-Kahn, 63, filed a countersuit earlier this year against Diallo for defamation. He has said the sexual encounter was consensual but has admitted it was a 'moral error.'

The resolution of the civil case brings Strauss-Kahn closer to ending his legal troubles, which have persisted since his return to France.

The former politician is awaiting a decision by a French court on his request to halt an inquiry to determine whether he should stand trial on pimping charges related to sex parties attended by him and by prostitutes.

Strauss-Kahn has quietly begun to resume his career in recent months, delivering speeches at private conferences and setting up a consulting firm in Paris.
