Vanishing act: Ben Stirling was set to take the starring role of legendary American entertainer Jimmy Durante

The star of a new London musical left his fellows fuming when he popped to the loo just an hour before the play's debut - and never came back.

The bizarre bolting incident occurred at the Gatehouse Theatre in Highgate, north London, where leading man Ben Stirling was due on stage for the opening night of Goodnight Mrs Calabash.

The actor was set to take the starring role of legendary American entertainer Jimmy Durante, and no-one thought anything of it when he took a toilet break before curtain-up.

After 15 minutes, though, the worried cast went to check on Mr Stirling - only to find he had fled into the night.

Shocked
theatre bosses were forced to refund 30 tickets bought in advance of 
the opening night, and turn another 30 people away from the door. 

Mr
Stirling, who has just done worldwide tours of Fame and Jesus Christ 
Superstar, never returned to the theatre after apparently walking out 
for personal reasons.

John Plews, artistic director of Upstairs at the Gatehouse, said: 'We did the dress rehearsal and everybody was happy.

'At
about six o'clock some of the actors went downstairs to eat and then 
the leading man got up from the table and we have never heard from him 
since.

'At that time we were hoping that maybe he was just sick, but he had done a runner.'

He added: 'It was like being left at the altar.'

Mr Plews said it was the first time in his career that he'd seen an actor flee his own play.

The incident is hardly a first in theatre-land, though: In one infamous episode 17 years ago, comedian Stephen Fry quit a West End production without notice and disappeared to France.

'At first we felt sorry for Ben because he obviously had a problem, but then we felt really angry because he had let down so many people,' said Mr Plews.

Last-minute replacement: Tim Frost (shown here) has taken the play's leading role at the last minute after Ben Stirling ran out on proceedings

To make matters worse, theatre bosses had already spent £350 on a fake nose for Stirling, who needed the prop because his character Durante had a huge hooter.

'The lead role in the musical is Jimmy Durante, a famous American entertainer in the 1940s, who was known as "the big schnozzola" because of his big nose,' said Mr Plews.

'Ben didn't have a very big nose so we got a prosthetic nose especially made for him at quite considerable cost.

'Because it was moulded especially to his face it sadly can't be used again.'

The theatre has since been told by Stirling's partner that he has returned to his mother's home in Scotland.

Luckily for theatre-goers, a new leading man, Tim Frost, who appeared last year in the Gatehouse's production of Play It Again Sam, has replaced Mr Stirling at zero notice.

'Tim has stepped into the breach and the show will go on,' said Mr Plews.

Stephen Fry is perhaps the most famous example of an actor who went missing during a play's run.

His walk-out took place in 1995 on the set of West End play Cell Mates, and he later revealed it was prompted by his manic depression.   

In 2008, Entourage star Jeremy Piven made a swift exit from David Mamet's Broadway play Speed-the-Plow, claiming he was suffering from mercury poisoning.

The actor's spokesperson said doctors had advised him to step down two months early, but director Mr Mamet was sceptical, saying:

'He told me that he discovered that he had a very high level of mercury. So my understanding is that he is leaving showbusiness to pursue a career as a thermometer.'

Peter Bowles, star of 70s sitcom To the Manor Born, at least produced an interesting excuse when he walked off the stage during a 2007 performance of The Waltz of the Toreadors.

Though it was later reported that he had been suffering from a viral infection, the thespian told the audience he 'was going to put the cat out'.
