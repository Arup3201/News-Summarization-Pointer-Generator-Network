Los Angeles police say speed may be a factor in a deadly crash involving Salma Hayek's brother.

Lt. Andrew Neiman tells the Los Angeles Times that 40-year-old Sami Hayek may have been going too fast on a curvy stretch of Sunset Boulevard when he lost control of a high-powered Ford GT Sunday afternoon. Hayek may have also been unfamiliar with the car. Neiman says the muscle car fishtailed, crossed into oncoming traffic and hit a pickup truck.

Neiman says no drugs or alcohol were involved.

Expensive taste: The sports car Hayek was driving is worth an estimated $165,000

Not in control: A spokesman for the LAPD said Hayek may not have been familiar with how to drive the Ford GT

The crash broke Hayek's ribs and killed his passenger, photographer and Grammy-winning art director Ian Cuttler Sala.

The driver of the truck, 20-year-old Alvin Javier Gomez was also hospitalized for a broken foot and body pains.

After
 the accident, Gomez tweeted: 'Only reason I'm alive right now is only 
because God himself gave me a second chance...Rest in Peace.'

Gomez's family told ABC 13 that he is recovering at home in San Diego.

The sports car Hayek was
 driving is worth approximately $165,000 according to Kelley Blue Book, 
and can reach speeds of up to 205 mph.

Witness Syed Abrar says accidents are normal on this particular curve of Sunset Boulevard.

Two
 hours after a KTLA news crew arrived on the scene, two more accidents 
happened - though no one seemed to be seriously hurt in either.

The investigation is ongoing and no charges has been filed yet.

According to Sala's website, he worked at Sony Music NY for nine years before becoming a photographer.

At Sony he created visual campaigns for musicians like Beyonce, Billy Joel and Mariah Carey.

On Tuesday, Beyonce paid tribute to the art director who designed the covers of 'Destiny Fulfilled' and 'Dangerously in Love' albums. On Facebook she wrote: 'Rest in Peace Ian Cuttler. Ian was a Grammy Award winning art director and photographer who will be greatly missed.'

As
 a photographer he has shot advertisements for Converse, Gillette and 
Lincoln Center as well as editorials for several magazines.

He earned his Grammy Award designing the packaging for 'Johnny Cash: The Legend' box set.

He will be missed: Beyonce mourned the loss of Sala on her Facebook page Tuesday

Sami and older 
sister Salma were born to parents Diana Jimenez Medina, an opera singer 
and talent scout, and Sami Hayek Dominguez, a businessman who once ran 
for mayor of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico.

Hayek
 currently runs his own design studio in Los Angeles, but originally 
started off studying business administration at Pepperdine.

While studying abroad at the University's Florence campus one year, he had a sudden change of heart.

Wrong way: Sami, pictured with Salma and their father Sami Sr, was driving a sports car on Sunset Boulevard when he lost control and crossed into oncoming traffic

'I stood up, turned my test in, walked to a phone booth woke my dad up and said, I'm out,' Hayek told People.

He told his father he was going to be a painter, sculptor or architect, to which is father responded: 'Your head is not right.'

But his jump into the creative field paid off, and he has since designed furniture for the likes of Brad Pitt.

He is married to jewelry-designer Daniela Villegas and the two live in a home in the Hollywood Hills.
