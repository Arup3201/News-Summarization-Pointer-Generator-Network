A dramatic video has emerged showing the moment Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton's 65-foot yacht sunk.

The National Park Service footage shows the luxury vessel quickly disappear underwater last fall. In February, investigators concluded that the sinking of the Lake Mead yacht owned by Mr Las Vegas was an accident.

The October 18 sinking of the 65-foot 
vessel was traced to the failure of two hoses to drain water from a rear
 storage compartment, National Park Service spokeswoman Christie Vanover
 said.

One hose was disabled by a kink, and the other wasn't properly connected, she said.

The new footage was obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal through a Freedom of Information Act request.

No one was on the boat and no one was injured when the 1996 Skipperliner, named Rendezvous, became swamped and sank stern-first in 49 feet of water in a slip at the Temple Bar marina on the Arizona side of the Colorado River reservoir.

The vessel and items in it were a complete loss, the park service report said.

McCrone had said that Newton and his wife, Kathleen McCrone, were vacationing out of the country when the boat sank.

The vessel was one of the largest on the vast reservoir behind Hoover Dam. A photo provided by the Park Service at the time showed the boat's bow sticking straight up from the water.

The loss of Newton's yacht came several weeks after the 71-year-old 'Danke Schoen' crooner lost a three-year ownership battle for his 40-acre 'Casa de Shenandoah' estate. Newton had lived at the spread several miles southeast of the Las Vegas Strip since 1968.

Newton had creditors at the door when he sold the property in 2010 for $19.5 million to CSD LLC, headed by investors Lacy and Dorothy Harber.

Newton, his family and their menagerie of exotic animals moved in June to a downsized nearby property with several homes on about 20 acres.

His former estate was put up for sale in September for $70 million.

Newton's sister-in-law, Tricia McCrone, 
confirmed at the time that the 1996 Skipperliner named Rendezvous 
belonged to Newton. She said Newton and his wife Kathleen were 
vacationing out of the country when the boat sank.

According to the Las Vegas Sun, some kind of equipment failure caused the yacht to take on water and sink within minutes.

Lake Havasu City Vessel Assist salvaged the boat later.

A photo provided at the time by the Park Service shows the boat's bow sticking straight up from the water.

Wayne Newton is one of the best-known entertainers in Las Vegas and is known variously as Mr Las Vegas, The Midnight Idol and Mr Entertainment.

He's best-known for his signature tune, Danke Schoen, which was released in 1963.
