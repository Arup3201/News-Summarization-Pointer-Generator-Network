As Manchester United turned in their most dominant display of the season against Tottenham on Sunday, the influence of one man cannot be underestimated. 

Michael Carrick's return to Louis van Gaal's starting XI proved crucial at Old Trafford, and could be the turning point for United as they look to finish in the top four this season. 

He took less than nine minutes to stamp his authority on the game and show the Old Trafford faithful what they have so missed during his two months out.

Win percentage: 66.70% 

Points per game: 2.2 

UNITED WITHOUT CARRICK

Win percentage: 42.90% 

Points per game: 1.6 

With Daley Blind on the ball at left back and no Tottenham players covering a huge gap just in from the left touchline, Carrick burst forward to receive the ball before instantly playing a perfectly weighted pass for Marouane Fellaini to open the scoring for United. 

Ten minutes later Carrick had headed his side 2-0 up and sent them on the way to a vital win. 

But it was the composure and attacking intent that Carrick provided on Sunday that United have missed so much in recent weeks - something which was not lost on his manager.

'Michael Carrick is not my second captain for nothing. He is one of the best passers also, not only wide but also forward. We need midfielders who have that passing,' said Van Gaal after the game.  

Indeed, with Carrick in the side United have picked up 2.2 points per game compared to just 1.6 without him. The club have won 66.7% of the game the midfielder has played but than number drops to 42.9% without the England midfielder.

In truth, nobody should be surprised. Carrick has been a mainstay of United's midfield for years now, anchoring the side from a deep position. 

Whether his midfield partners have been of the necessary quality over the years is debatable, but with the likes of Ander Herrera and Blind - as well as the revitalised Fellaini - now available, Carrick should not have to carry the burden all by himself. 

At 33, however, Carrick remains United's main man. As well as Herrera and Blind have done in their first seasons in English football, neither have the authority or influence of Carrick. 

With trips to Liverpool, Chelsea and Everton to come too, Carrick's big-game experience will also be key.  

With nine games to go, United will be hoping Carrick stays fit, because with him in the side, they have a much better chance of finishing in the top four.
