A suspected fugitive sniper who opened fire on his neighbours held police at bay for several hours before being shot dead.

The gunman in Arlington, Washington State, shot a neighbour in the leg before opening fire on a SWAT team during a dramatic shoot-out in nearby woodland.

Police in armoured vehicles surrounded the man spotted with a rifle and a scope in Arlington, Snohomish County north of Seattle, as the stand-off unfolded on Sunday afternoon.

They had originally been called out to reports of a shooting on a residential driveway before the man, who has not been identified, went on the run to woodland near Arlington.

Snohomish County Sheriff's spokeswoman Shari Ireton said late on Sunday that the male suspect was deceased and a weapon was recovered. No other details were immediately available.

She said authorities continued to search for a possible second suspect.

The man who was shot in his driveway about 1:30 p.m. called authorities before he was taken to a hospital with a non-life threatening injury.

Officers understood someone was in the woods, shooting at vehicles or people, so they initiated a SWAT team call.

Soon after police said their armoured vehicles were hit 'several times' by gunfire from the woods.

Resident Linda Purtteman, who was walking her dog in the area Sunday afternoon, told The Seattle Times that she heard gunshots, but initially was unfazed by them.

'I have a few neighbors who go shooting a lot out here, so I didn't think anything of it,' she said.

But then, a neighbor told her shots had been fired at a SWAT team and people in the area were urged to stay indoors, she said.
