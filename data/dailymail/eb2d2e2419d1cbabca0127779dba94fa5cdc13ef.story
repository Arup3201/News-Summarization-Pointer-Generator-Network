Friends and neighbours of 55-year-old Charlene Ferrero were shocked when they heard she sleepwalked to her death.

Police believe she left her Oaklyn, New Jersey apartment sometime Saturday night and fell from a train trestle into a lake, and drowned - all while she was asleep.

Her body was pulled from Newton Lake by search crews Monday night.

Tragedy: 55-year-old Charlene Ferrero drowned accidentally after sleepwalking into a lake, police say

Place of death? Police believe she fell from a train trestle sometime early Sunday morning

Police received a report Saturday night of a disoriented-looking woman wandering the streets in her pyjamas.

However, a search for the missing woman yielded nothing.

Her friend and neighbour Teresa Cerini said she was worried about Ms Ferrero after a neighbour found her cell phone in the grass by her apartment in Hill Manor.

The door, Ms Cerini found, was unlocked.

She found her keys, pocketbook and wallet on a chair inside Ms Ferrero’s apartment.

‘The only thing I touched was her keys. (I) locked the door and called police,’ Ms Cerini told CBSPhilly.com.

She also noticed her car was also parked at an odd angle and was missing its passenger-side mirror. 

Ms Ferrero worked as a waitress at the Starview Diner in Somerdale, New Jersey. Her co-workers are just as baffled as her friends over her tragic end.

Another sever at the diner said she couldn’t believe Ms Ferrero didn’t wake up once she hit the water.

‘You’re going to be out in your bare feet and 2 o’clock in the morning when it’s freezing? I don’t know, it just doesn’t sit right with me,’ she told WPVI-TV.

Co-worker Susan Murtaugh said: ‘It’s really disturbing to all of us. Sleepwalking, none of us know that ever happened with her.’

The autopsy ruled Ms Ferrero’s death an accident, though it will take several weeks for results of the toxicology report.

Medications such as sleep aid Ambien have been known to cause sleepwalking.

Sleepwalking often occurs during deep, non-REM sleep when the person is most asleep. While people often stay in their own homes, sleepwalkers have been known to do travel great distances.

Kenneth Parks, a 23-year-old man from Toronto suffering from insomnia, drove 14 miles to his in-law’s house, killing his mother-in-law and severely injuring his father-in-law. He was acquitted in 1988 when a team of psychologists said he was ‘asleep’ and therefore unaware of his actions.

One Australian woman left her apartment and had sex with strangers while sleepwalking. She was later cured in 2005.

Ms Cerini said she had witnessed her sleepwalking first-hand a week and a half earlier and said she looked seemingly ‘awake,’ but not aware.

Ms Cerini had woken up to a knock on her door late in the night. Shocked, she saw it was Ms Ferrero and asked what she was doing up at that hour.

‘And she goes, “I’m so sorry. The people at Table Two ordered the eggs,”’ she told WPVI-TV.

Ms Cerini helped her friend home. Ms Ferrero said she used to sleepwalk as a child.

‘I said, “Guess what, honey? You still do,”’ Ms Cerini told her, telling her also that the behaviour was ‘scary and dangerous.’ 

The phenomenon of sleepwalking isn’t entirely understood by scientists, though it is often passed down through generations.

It isn’t dangerous to walk sleepwalkers, contrary to popular belief, though they will be disoriented for some time while they regain their bearings.
