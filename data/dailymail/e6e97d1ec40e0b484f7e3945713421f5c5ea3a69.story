The families of two friends who vanished during a late-night fishing trip have asked people to pray for their safe return as divers prepare to comb a lake for their bodies.

Detective searching for Mason Cox and David Wood, both 20, are baffled by their disappearance more than a week ago.

They were last seen on Thursday January 2 before they headed to Lake Lanier in Dawsonville, Georgia, about 60 miles north of Atlanta.

But their fishing equipment had been left behind and they both left personal belongings at Mr Cox's family home.

Police have no evidence of foul play but have been using cadaver dogs, specially trained to follow the scent of bodies, to scour the area where they were last seen.

Dawson County's Sheriff's Major Tony Wooten told DawsonNews.com: 'At this point, we don't suspect foul play.

'There's nothing other than that they got up to go fishing and at that point they haven't been seen since. We've got nothing to show that any foul play was involved.'

At a press 
conference today, both mothers reached out to their sons and spoke of their hope to see their safe return.

Mason’s mother Leanne Cox said: 'My son 
left his cellphone, his wallet, the shirt he was wearing that night — 
it’s all in his room. His car is here. He’s just gone.'

'These are strong 
kids. They are smart. Something stupid has just happened. Everybody is 
here for you. Nothing is going to happen. If anything is wrong, don’t 
worry, we’re here to support you. We’re here.

'We don't know what happened. It's like they just disappeared into thin air.'

Ethelyn Geiger added: 
'David, Mason, if you can hear this, please call somebody. We’re very 
worried about you. We just want to find our boys.'

Relatives today posted an update on a Facebook page set up to keep friends and the public up to date with the search.

Mr
 Cox's brother wrote: 'Divers are going out today... We have been 
waiting days for the ice to be break up and melt. Finally the Georgia 
Bureau of Investigation and search and rescue team can get their 
equipment in to survey the the bottom of lake lanier.

'Please pray for the best outcome, I again thank you all for your efforts and support in the search of my brother Mason Cox and David Wood.'

Earlier the family posted a message vowing to hunt down those involved in the disappearance of their loved ones.

It read: 'The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is finally involved to find my missing brother and his friend. To those who are ignorant, they did not run away and are not hiding.

'We will find those involved with the disappearance and punish them to the fullest extent their life has to offer.'

Speaking a day after their disappearance, David Wood’s mother Ms Geiger told the Gainesville Times: 'David and Mason have been best friends for years. They are good boys. They did what normal 20-year-olds did.

'They went night fishing that morning and were supposed to come back and hang out with us for the day after New Year’s. They didn’t come back. We haven’t seen them since. We don’t know where they are.'
