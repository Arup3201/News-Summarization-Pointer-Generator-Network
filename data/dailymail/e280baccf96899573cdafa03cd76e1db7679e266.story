Scientists have found a way of creating alcohol from coffee grounds.

A team of Spanish and Portuguese researchers made alcohol that was 80-proof - the equivalent of 40 per cent alcohol -  making it the same strength as vodka and tequila.

In a study, published in LWT – Food Science and Technology, they explained how they made the drink from ‘spent ground coffee’.

Scientists have found a way of creating alcohol from used coffee grounds. The spirit is said to smell and taste of coffee but some tasters say it tastes 'bitter and pungent'

The scientists say that the spirit is ‘pleasant’ and that it both smells and tastes of coffee, The Huffington Post reports.

The creators used dried coffee grounds from a roasting company in Portugal to make the drink.

They heated the coffee in water at 162.8ºC for 45 minutes.

They then added sugar and yeast to the mixture before allowing it to ferment.

This raised the alcohol content.

However, in the process of making the drink alcoholic, most of the caffeine was removed.

Once the drink was ready for consumption, the scientists employed eight trained testers to try it out.

However, many said that it had a ‘bitter and pungent’ taste.

This is believed to be the first time that coffee has been used to make alcohol.

However, it has previously been used to create biofuel.
