Brendan Rodgers was pleased with the courage his Liverpool side showed as the Reds lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The Anfield manager elected to rest a number of key players - including Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson - and was pleased with the performance of those called upon to fill in. 

'Real Madrid have been scoring threes and fours - to keep it (1-0) shows the quality of our performance.

'We had the courage to play. We're very proud of the team and showed wonderful composure to play in such a wonderful arena.'

Rodgers' decision to drop seven first-teamers for the Group B clash shocked many but the 41-year-old insisted their was a plan. 

'I knew what I was doing to get the result and we nearly got that,' said the Liverpool boss. 

'I'm disappointed with result but performance-wise the players did well and the young players are adapting.'

Needing to win their final two group matches, Rodgers responded swiftly when asked if Liverpool had a chance of progressing.

'Every chance,' the Northern Irishman said. 'That's what we looked at; we felt we needed to win at Ludogorets away and then it comes to the last game at home to Basel.

'We've got some important games before that but it's in our hands.'
