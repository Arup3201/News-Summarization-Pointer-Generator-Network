A new video released by the Hawthorne Police in California adds a new perspective on the shooting of a dog that caused uproar on the internet.

On June 30, Leon Rosby was out walking his dog when he came across a police scene and started filming it while also blasting music from his car. Police then arrested him for 'interference with officers.'

While being arrested, his dog escaped from his car and ran over to his owner. When the dog jumped at an officer, the officer shot and killed the dog.

Police release another video: The new video, taken by another bystander, gives a closer-up view of what happened on June 30

Escape: Rosby's dog jumps out of the car and runs over to his master

Loose dog: The officer attempts to grab the leash and restrain the dog, but is unable. When the dog lurches at him, he shoots

Shots: The video ends abruptly with the officer's first shot at the dog. Though the officer continues with more shots viewable in the first video, spokesman Swain says that's normal police procedure

The whole interaction was filmed by witnesses nearby, and one video posted to YouTube that same day went viral.

That viral video attracted serious criticism for the officer's handling of the situation.

In the week since that video was posted, outrage over the incident has spread both on the internet and in Hawthorne.

Internet 'hacktivist' group Anonymous posted a threatening video to the police on July 3.

'Police of Hawthorne, you must know that you are our primary target. This matter will not remain unresolved. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us,' the masked Anonymous representative says in the video.

About 100 members in the community held a protest outside police headquarters on June 6. A Change.org petition calling for the prosecution of the police officers had almost 98,000 signatures as of Monday night.

Calling for reform: About 100 people gathered to protest the shooting of the dog outside of Hawthorne police headquarters on June 6

There have even been death threats sent to the police officers involved, which has lead the department to take three officers off of street duty.

But on July 7, the police released another video taken of the incident that shows more of Leon Rosby's interaction with police before his dog was fatally shot - A new perspective that they believe helps their case.

This video was taken by another witness at the scene, and gives a closer perspective on the shooting, as well as clearer audio of the exchange between Rosby and Police.

'This video will help us tremendously regarding [Rosby's] actions prior to his arrest,' Lt. Scott Swain of the Hawthorne Police told The Huffington Post. 'You can see the officer gives out his hand to let the dog sniff it and tries to grab the leash.'

Bystander: Leon Rosby, 52, was walking his dog and video-tapping a police scene when he was arrested for obstruction of justice

Detained: Rosby did not put up a fight and let the police officer's arrest him without incident after he put his dog in the car

Threats: The three police officers have since been pulled from street duty for their safety in Southern California after the video of them shooting the dog went viral

Killed: A police officer shot the dog when it ran over to his owner. Rosby is now in the process of filing a suit against the police department for the incident

As for criticism as to why the officer shot the dog so many times, Swain says that's just normal police procedure.

'We're not trained to shoot one shot or to shoot in the leg. You're always trained to shoot multiple shots. Firing a gun is a last resort. We're trained to eliminate the threat, and that's a judgement call on the officers.'

Currently, the Hawthorne Police do not put their officers through dog training.

'We'll have to see about that at the end of this investigation,' Swain said. 'It's something that we'll consider.'

Even with the new video, some remain skeptical of the officer's actions.

Robert Helfend, a defense attorney in L.A. said that it seems police didn't have a plan in place with how to deal with the dog.

'It would seem, in hindsight, that the officers could have simply let Mr. Rosby go temporarily, to contain his animal,' Helfend said. 'They then could have permitted Mr. Rosby to phone someone to pick up the dog. The so-called crime that Mr. Rosby supposedly committed was not life-threatening nor was he a danger to the community.'

While still upset with the police's handling of the situation, Rosby has spoken out discouraging others from threatening the officer's lives.

Rosby in due in court for the interfering with police charge on August 12, and if convicted could serve between six months to a year in county jail.
