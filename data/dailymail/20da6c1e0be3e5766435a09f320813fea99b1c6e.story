Oldest pimp in town: Raymond Telford, 77, leaving Leeds Crown Court today after being ordered to pay a £140,000 fine for running two brothels

A grandfather slapped with a £140,000 fine for running two brothels has said he was only trying to 'keep women safe'.

Raymond Telford, 77, who has been operating the brothels for more than 25 years, also called for prostitution to be legalised and said he 'will open up more premises' if it is.

He claimed to have operated premises for gay, lesbian, transvestite and transsexual clients over the years and said people should not ridicule his work because it 'saves lives'.

The pensioner was speaking after being ordered to pay £140,000 at a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Leeds Crown Court today.

His case related to police raids on addresses in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in December 2010, when prostitutes were found to be working and clients accepted they were paying for sexual services.

Telford said he was refusing to call time on his career as a brothel owner, and added: 'I suppose at my age I should be calling it a day.

'But I think one day it will be legalised in this country and, if I'm still around when it is, I will open some more premises.'

Reacting to the decision of the court, he said: 'Life is life and I will just have to pay it.

'But what most people don't understand is that by closing me down they are just endangering more working girls.

'They will continue working whatever happens but this time they will be doing it on their own where they are more vulnerable.

'At my place the working girls were much safer, they had health visits each month by a doctor and got condoms and everything they needed. We have got to look at things in perspective.

'I think if it went to a vote most people would agree that prostitution should be legalised as long as brothels are properly regulated.'

Telford said he had spent years working in construction, based in Holland and Saudi Arabia, before opening his first brothel in Leeds in the 1980s.

He said: 'I have been around working girls for most of my life and nearly all of them are decent people. To do what I did you need to know how their brains work and what makes them tick.

'People may look down their noses and ridicule and criminalise people who get involved in this industry but I think prostitution saves a lot of lives. Making it legal would save even more.'
