The biggest single turning point in modern history was the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Japan at the end of the Second World War, according to new research.

The use of nuclear weapons to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki was more pivotal than a series of other milestones, including the events that sparked World War One and the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, according to a survey of more than 1,000 British adults.

The research found that more than one in four people rated the end of the Second World War and the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 as the most significant.

Next most significant was 9/11 with 16 per cent of those polled rating the terrorist attacks in the U.S. as the most monumental.

The bombings in Japan represent the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date. An estimated 150,000 to 220,000 people were killed in the two Japanese cities.

The research, commissioned by adult learning website Love to Learn, marks the release of a new online course exploring Turning Points in Modern History.

The six-part course looks at the causes and effects of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand that went on to trigger World War One, along with five other historical turning points that bring people up to the present day.

The research uncovers how the 50-plus generation perceives key events, spanning from the beginning of the First World War to the destruction of the World Trade Centre in 2001. 

While historians might long debate which events since 1900 have had the greatest impact, the people polled identified the 9/11 attacks on the United States as more significant that Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s.

The Turning Points in Modern History online course is led by history author John Child who said: ‘History is not just about isolated events. It's also about understanding their causes and evaluating their effects. 

‘Some famous events accelerate the pace of change but other, more momentous turning points in history create a world which is very different than it was before. 

‘The fascinating thing about this course is that it creates a debate about how significant each of these famous events really was. People really enjoy arguing the case for their own view.’

Opinions varied according to age with younger respondents in their early fifties putting more significance on more recent events such as 9/11.

Monumental: The next most significant point was considered to be the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City, as voted by 16 per cent of the more than 1,000 British adults who participated in the survey

Adults in their seventies were more likely to cite the start of the Second World War and Hitler's rise to power.

The vast majority of those who took part in the research believed the key turning points should be taught in schools. More than three-quarters of people (77 per cent) said that the end of the Second World War and the dropping of the atomic bomb should be continued to be taught in History lessons in British schools. 

More than half (54 per cent) believed that the Archduke's assassination leading to the First World War should continue to be on the curriculum.

Dr Sean Lang, senior lecturer in history at Anglia Ruskin University, said: ‘The research underpinning this online course suggests that different age groups, even among the over fifties, have different perspectives on this.

‘Perhaps not surprisingly, those with longer memories tend to emphasise the significance of earlier events in history. They are, after all, well placed to know.’
