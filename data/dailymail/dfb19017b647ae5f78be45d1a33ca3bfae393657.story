A recent review of studies has found bikini waxing could be linked to an increased risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection

For thousands of women across the globe a bikini wax is part of their regular beauty regime.

But experts say the procedure should come with a health warning.

A recent review of studies, which appeared in the journal of JAMA Dermatology, found waxing could be linked to an increased risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI).

The findings show the action of removing pubic hair can cause 'deficits in the mucocutaneous barrier' - the membrane of the skin - allowing viruses or bacteria to enter the body.

Sexually promiscuity is found to be linked to pubic hair removal, another reason given for the increased risk of developing an STI.

The study states: 'Pubic hair grooming is becoming an increasingly common practice among women of all societies and demographic groups.

'In the United States, women are more likely to groom for reasons that are sexually driven and are more likely to stop grooming when lacking a current sexual partner.

'Further, pubic hair removal is significantly associated with a greater interest in sex and having a casual sex partner.'

Although generally deemed to be a safe beauty procedure, waxing can cause micro-trauma to the skin and its underlying structures.

That in turn can cause folliculitis - an infection of the hair follicles - local spread of infection, burns and the development of syringoma - benign tumours.

Bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be among the infections people are at risk of contracting.

They can be transmitted via contaminated waxing tools or from the person performing the procedure, the review highlighted.

The researchers reported: 'Pubic hair waxing can also cause burns, with most being superficial or partial-thickness burns.

The report, published in the journal JAMA Dermatology, found waxing can cause microtrauma to the skin's surface allowing viruses and infections to pass into the body. Experts say sexual promiscuity could be to blame, as more women remove their pubic hair when they are sexually active

'Severe burns requiring debridement and split skin grafting have been described follwing the use of self-waxing kits.

'Waxing causes deficits in the mucocutaneous barrier that may be sufficient for viral entry and transmission, potentially increasing the risk of aquiring sexually tranmitted infections (STIs).

'One study demonstrated a correlation between sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum and the use of pubic hair removal practices.'

Experts said due to the popularity of waxing, beauty practitioners should be made aware of the potential dermatological complications.

'While it has been shown that pubic hair waxing directly correlates with increased sexual prevalence, more studies are necessary to further elucidate the risk of STI transmission after waxing,' the report states.

'Individuals who wax their pubic hair should be informed of this possible risk and perhaps be advised to abstain from sexual activity for a certain period of time after waxing.'

Previous studies have found that bikini waxing, rather than increase the risk of STIs, can help prevent specific infections.

Doctors say hair removal could be helping to eradicate public lice.

Waning infestations of the bloodsucking insects have been linked to a rise in the prevalence of waxing.

Australian scientists noted that Sydney's main sexual health clinic had not seen a woman with pubic lice since 2008, and male cases had fallen 80 per cent from about 100 a decade ago.

Basil Donovan, head of sexual health at the University of New South Wales's Kirby Institute, said last year: 'it used to be extremely common, it's now rarely seen.

'Without doubt, it's better grooming.'
