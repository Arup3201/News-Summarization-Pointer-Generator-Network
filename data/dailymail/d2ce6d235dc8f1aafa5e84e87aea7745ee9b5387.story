Hate preacher Anjem Choudary today backtracked on comments he previously made about his links with one of Drummer Lee Rigby's suspected killers in the face of an MI5 investigation.

Choudary said he has not been in touch with murder suspect Michael Adebolajo since 'before 2007' after it was revealed MI5 investigators were looking into the amount of contact, if any, he had with the two suspects.

But last week Choudary said he last saw him in 2011 as he admitted knowing the 28-year-old British-born Nigerian. He described him as a man of 'impeccable character' in interviews with BBC Newsnight and Channel 4 News.

He has now appeared to attempt to
distance himself from the suspect after an intelligence source was 
quoted in The Sun newspaper as saying: 'One of the priorities is to 
clear up the level of any contact between Choudary and these two men.

'The investigators will be 
particularly interested in the timing of any contacts or associations in
the months, weeks, days or even hours leading up to the murder.'

Choudary today said: 'You won't find 
any contact between us (meaning Adebolajo) for the last six or seven 
years - probably before 2007.

'Let them investigate. They won't find anything at all.'

He also repeated being unaware of 
having ever met the second alleged attacker Michael Adebowale, 22, who 
is now being questioned by police for the first time about the horrific 
murder.

Choudary said: 'I'm not concerned about anything. It was a lone wolf attack.'

Anjem Choudary described suspect Michael Adebolajo as a man of 'impeccable character' in interviews with BBC Newsnight and Channel 4 News last week

The connection initially came to light after Adebolajo and Adebowale were arrested on suspicion of hacking Drummer Rigby to death in broad daylight after he was run down with a car last Wednesday.

Choudary, who led Islamist group Al 
Muhajiroun - the banned forerunner to Islam4UK where Adebolajo often 
appeared with other radical protesters - last week said he recognised Adebolajo from TV footage at the scene.

Choudary said last week: 'I went to the same primary school as him in Woolwich, Mulgrave, 
and grew up in the same area and he came to the local mosque - it was a 
peaceful community with lots of Muslim people from Somalia and Pakistan.
I didn’t know him that well so I can’t say where his family was from.

'He converted around 2003 to Islam, before I met him and I knew him as his convert name "Mujaheed" when he used to attend our demonstrations and lectures. I last saw him in 2011, he was a very nice man with impeccable character and nothing unusual about him.'

He added: 'What he did was unusual and it’s not the kind of view that I propagate and I do not condone the use of violence, but those views are out there. Some members of the Muslim community struggle to express themselves and he is making his voice heard in blood.'

Choudary suggested that it was possible the attack was motivated by British government foreign policy in the Muslim world, and that this may not have been an isolated incident.

He said: 'We are a very politicised community. Some people are angered by draconian measures such as "stop and search" and restrictions on free speech.

'There is a chance of more lone wolf attacks happening again due to these draconian measures.

Interview: Controversial preacher Choudary was interviewed on BBC2 Newsnight last week following the death of Drummer Lee Rigby

Web: These men are all believed to be linked in various ways to Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, the radicals accused of murdering soldier Lee Rigby

'If you want to condemn anyone it’s the British government, this is one death but if you add up the number of people killed and tortured by the British government it is in the millions.'

Adebolajo's family last night said 
they were horrified by the murder and sent their ‘heartfelt condolences’
to the family of slain soldier Lee Rigby.

In an extraordinary statement, they 
said they shared the horror of the nation at the ‘senseless killing’ and
‘fully expect’ that the killers will be brought to justice.

They added: ‘We wholeheartedly condemn 
all those who engage in acts of terror and fully reject any suggestion 
by them that religion or politics can justify this kind of violence.’

Fallen hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, from Manchester, was described as 'cheeky and humorous' in tributes. He was executed by two suspected Islamic terrorists in Woolwich last week

Last night, counter-terrorism detectives were also preparing to question Adebowale, 22, over his role in the Woolwich horror last Wednesday.

After being discharged by doctors, Adebowale was re-arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a police officer, in addition to killing Drummer Rigby.

It is understood that 28-year-old Adebolajo is in a far more serious condition and could remain in hospital for ‘some time’.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
