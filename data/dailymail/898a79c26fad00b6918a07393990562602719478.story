A pensioner was bludgeoned to death with a slow cooker after a heated argument about presidential politics with her friend, a court has heard. 

On Thursday a suburban Detroit judge ordered that Tewana Sullivan be tried for first-degree murder following the death of Cheryl Livy, 66, at her home in a Livonia senior housing complex in October. 

Police Officer Michael Lewallen says when called to the apartment he found Sullivan, 50, sobbing near her mortally injured friend and saying she was 'sorry' she 'did it', and blood all over the walls.

Sullivan broke down in court as the judge hear how Livy had died because of injuries to her head, face and mid back, caused by a 'blunt instrument'.

The Detroit News also reported that Livy also suffered injuries on the back of hands, which appeared to have been caused as she tried to protect herself. 

The cord of the slow cooker was wrapped around the victim's next when police arrived. 

Defense lawyer John McWilliams said the women were arguing over 'presidential politics' and 'whatever the controversy is between Democrats and Republicans.'

He did not reveal which woman took which side.

Livy was 'barely breathing' when she was discovered, the court heard, but died two days later in hospital from her injuries.

When police arrested Sullivan she appeared disorientated and 'under the influence', they testified, with blood on her hands and clothing nearby.

She was initially charged with assault with intent to murder, but following Livy's death the charges were upgraded to first-degree murder which carries a mandatory penalty of life without parole. 

Sullivan is currently being held in the Wayne County Jail and will next appear in court on February 12.
