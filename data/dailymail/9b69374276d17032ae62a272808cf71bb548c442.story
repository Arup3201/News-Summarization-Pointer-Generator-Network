The family of a murdered 16-year-old boy told how they feared they could be targeted next by the killer after he spent a second day on the run from prison.

Alan John Giles, 56, was serving two life sentences for the murder and kidnap of student Kevin Ricketts, who he butchered in 1995 in revenge for being dumped by his older sister, Elizabeth.

On Monday night Giles absconded from HMP Hewell, near Redditch, Worcestershire, after he walked out of an open section of the multi-category prison.

West Mercia Police launched a manhunt and have warned the public not to approach Giles.

Hours
 after the break-out the niece of murdered Kevin told followers on 
Twitter that her family had been told to ‘stay in our homes’ until Giles
 was caught.

Hannah Tyler, 
19, posted: ‘Had a few people 
asking about this so just to confirm yes the news about the escaped 
prisoner does involve my family.

‘He
 kidnapped and murdered my uncle and he’s out. He has been missing for 
over 24 hours now and people need to know. Please contact the police if 
you see him. My family’s safety is at risk.’

Detectives said Giles escaped between 6am and 11am on Monday from an open part of the 1,261-capacity jail - which houses both category B and D prisoners.

Detective
 Inspector John Cashion said: ‘We have a dedicated investigation team 
working expeditiously to locate and apprehend Giles and to that end we 
are also liaising with our colleagues in West Midlands Police and in the
 Prison Service.

Prison: HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire - which can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said it was unacceptably dirty

‘We have information that gives us concern for his welfare and it is important that we trace him as soon as possible.

‘It should be borne in mind that Giles was in an open part of the prison when he went missing.

‘However we would appeal to anyone who sees him not to approach him but to contact police immediately on 999.

HMP Hewell - which is governed by 
Stephanie Roberts-Bibby and can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a 
scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said 
it was unacceptably dirty.

The
 report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were 
high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs
 and some staff seemed to lack motivation.

It
 also said: ‘Some communal areas were filthy even after they had been 
“cleaned” by wing cleaners, and waste was thrown out of cells into the 
exercise yards below, which went unchallenged.’

The
 prison said 'decisive action' had been taken, and the National Offender
 Management Service said the management team had been strengthened.

‘Furthermore, we would urge anyone who may be helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay.

'We are leaving no stone unturned in order to find Giles as we will provide whatever resources are required in order to achieve that.

'I'm making a direction appeal to Alan Giles himself personally to hand himself in at the nearest police station as soon as possible or to phone us on 999.

'I would also urge anyone who is helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay.'

He added: 'We don't know why he left.

'We can't underestimate the fact that he was convicted of murder and kidnap.

'We have no specific information that gives us grave concern for any members of the public.

'We don't know what his intentions are.'

No one else is thought to have been involved in helping the on-the-run killer, who may have used the public transport network to leave the area.

It is understood measures have been taken to ensure the safety of members of Kevin’s family.

Giles,
 from Oldbury, West Midlands, is described as white, 5ft 9in in height 
and of proportionate build, with short grey hair and blue eyes.

He has a scar on the right of his forehead and another small one by his left eye.

The murderer also has tattoos of an eagle on his back and a swallow, shark and flower on his left arm.

Shy
 teenager Kevin failed to return to the home he shared with his mother, 
Carole, in Woodgate Valley, Birmingham, after a day at college on 
January 31, 1995.

Giles, who
 had worked as a builder, quickly emerged as a suspect as he had 
recently gone through an acrimonious split with Kevin’s older sister 
Elizabeth.

He was obsessed 
with his former lover and even tried to climb up to the balcony of her 
flat, forcing her to jump with their young daughter from the first 
floor.

Giles was jailed for a
 month after breaking a court injunction to keep away from Elizabeth and
 then hatched a plan to murder Kevin as revenge.

Police
 believe he staked out the teenager’s route to the bus stop and watched 
his movements as he left for college every day before snatching him.

Giles was initially arrested on suspicion of kidnap but got a breakthrough when key witness Carl Morris came forward.

Mr Morris told police he had befriend Giles at a hostel and the murderer had roped him into helping destroy any traces of Kevin.

Giving
 evidence at court, the witness said Giles had driven him though 
Moseley, Birmingham, instructing him to rip up homework and throw it out
 of the window.

Giles, a former labourer, was described by police as an ‘expert digger’ at the time of the killing.

‘I don't know whether I grabbed him with one hand or two hands. You just lose it. I probably grabbed him round the throat'

- murderer Alan John Giles describes to police the moment he killed Kevin Ricketts

He was found guilty of murder and kidnap and jailed for life at Birmingham Crown Court in July 1997.

At the time he was just the ninth killer in the UK to be put behind bars despite no trace of a victim’s body.

In
 a shocking twist, Giles phoned police from his cell in Gartree Prison 
in Leicestershire in July 1998 to confess to the killing and reveal 
where he had buried the body.

After
 spending hours carefully excavating earth in the back garden of a house
 in leafy Gough Road, Edgbaston, West Midlands, forensic anthropologists
 managed to recover a body which had been concealed five feet below the 
surface and hidden by thick undergrowth.

Dental
 records and x-rays confirmed that the body was Kevin’s, although the 
body was too badly decomposed to establish a cause of death.

At Kevin’s inquest, a transcript was read out of the interview between Giles and police.

It read: ‘I don’t know whether I grabbed him with one hand or two hands.

‘You just lose it. I probably grabbed him round the throat.

‘A struggle broke out. I left him on the ground, where I showed you, in the garden.’

He went on to say that he had hit the student with a piece of wood, but it was not clear whether that had killed him.

After his murder, Kevin’s distraught mum Carole, now 68, suffered a nervous breakdown. She now lives in Birmingham.

A friend, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I know Carole well because we swapped bungalows about five months ago.

‘I
 last saw her on Tuesday and she looked very pale and drawn. She was in 
her car hurrying somewhere. It looked like she needed to get somewhere 
fast.

Troubles: The HMIP report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs and some staff seemed to lack motivation

‘Giles ruined her
 and her family’s life. The fact he has been allowed to walk out of 
prison is appalling and it means his family have to go through the pain 
he caused all over again.

‘If he had any decency at all he would kill himself.’

A
 Ministry of Justice spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The level of absconding
 from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began.

‘Absconds
 are still 13 per cent lower under this Government. We are not 
complacent about this issue and are looking at ways in which the risk of
 absconding can be reduced further.

‘We
 are committed to ensuring that risk to the public is minimised. All 
those located in open conditions have been rigorously risk assessed and 
categorised as being of low risk to the public.’

Giles
 was believed to have been wearing a grey jumper, blue jeans and white 
trainers. He has had recent contact with family in the West Midlands and
 most of his friends are in the same area.

HMP
 Hewell was created by an amalgamation of the three former prisons on 
this site, Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange, in June 2008. The 
prison formerly known as Brockhill has since closed.
