While most mothers can look forward to receiving at least one card this Sunday, one super mum is going to get spoilt rotten with twelve.

Devoted mother Tania Sullivan will receive one from each of her bumper crop of offspring.

Tania and her husband Mike, 40, have raised their 14-strong family without state handouts in a modest five bedroom house in Hoo, Kent.

Supermum: Britain's best supermum is celebrating Mother's Day in style with her 12 children

The wonder-mum works 24 hours a day, seven days week, but this Sunday she gets treated to a well-deserved day-off.

She said: 'I always wanted a lot of children, maybe six, but I never thought I'd end up with double that.

'I wouldn't say no to more either. '

'After I had the first two, I thought that was it. Then I had eight miscarriages which made me look at having children differently.

'I felt lucky to have them and to be honest having more children didn't really change our lives that much.

'I think once you have a fair few, the work is all the same.'

Tania, who had her first child aged 18, says she is distraught that her eldest son Ben is moving out for the first time on Mother's Day.

Growing brood: Tania always wanted a large family but never imagined it would grow into a 14-strong one

Day off: Tania is looking forward to a much-deserved break on Sunday, she usually cooks, cleans and even home schools her children

She said: 'He tells me not to be upset and that I have plenty more children, but that's not the point, no one else is like him. They're all different and I only get one of each.'

The Sullivans are as self-sufficient as possible, both being self-employed, they rely on no one else.

They make their own bread, butter and jam and even raise their own hens for eggs. But perhaps most incredibly, the Sullivans home school every single one of their children.

Tania said: 'Home schooling does cost but the flexibility is priceless and the children learn so much more. I think they feel fortunate. Â

'The only time they ask to go to normal school is when it's a snow day!'

Tania met Mike at school at the tender age of 13. She said it took him a year of wooing her before she accepted and gave him a shot.

Together they've raised Ben, 20, Stephanie, 18, Caitlin, 13, Harry, 10, Eddie, eight, Sidney, seven, Paddy, five, Oliver, three, Joseph, two, twins Anna and Libby, 16 months and last but not least Isobel who is just three months.

Stephanie said: 'My mum is absolutely amazing. She is more than just a mother, she is a friend when I need someone to talk to and a teacher when I need guidance.

Helping hand: Tania gets a helping hand from her mother who she describes as 'amazing'

'She never asks for gifts or flowers for Mother's Day and despite me and Ben offering to babysit she would still rather spend it with the whole family.

'I would love to spend bundles of money on her but the truth is she is far to selfless, so this year I'll be doing arts and crafts with the kids to make mum a gift.

'I know she'd love it and to be honest she wouldn't have it any other way.'

Tania's website largerfamilylife.com offers support and advice for other large families.
