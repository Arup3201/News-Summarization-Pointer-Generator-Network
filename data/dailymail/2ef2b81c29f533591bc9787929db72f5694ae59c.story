The former executive assistant of pop star Justin Bieber has been handed a twelve-month good behaviour bond for drug possession.

During the musicians recent Australian tour, Terrence Reche Smalls was busted with 13 grams of cannabis plant material and resin at Brisbane Airport.

Smalls pleaded guilty via phone to two charges of importing border-controlled drugs with a lack of commercial intent in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday.

Justine Bieber's former assistant Terrence Reche Smalls is on a year long good behaviour bond for the possession of 13 grams of cannabis at Brisbane Airport last year

The drugs were found in 24-year-old Smalls's bag when Bieber and his entourage landed in Brisbane on November 24 last year, on the first stop in the star's Australian tour.

A court heard Smalls initially denied the drugs were his but defence lawyer Jeff Hunter said his client accepted responsibility for packing the bag.

If he breaches the year long bond he will be forced to pay a $1000 fine.

Justin Bieber also got himself in trouble while in Queensland last year for spray painting a hotel

The member of the pop star's entourage was originally supposed to appear in court in December of last year but was tied up with tour duties.

Justin Bieber also found himself in trouble during the same trip to Queensland when he posted a photo posing next to a wall he had splashed with graffiti.

Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate told the teen to clean up his act along with the external wall of the QT Hotel in Surfers Paradise, though the 'artwork' still remains.
