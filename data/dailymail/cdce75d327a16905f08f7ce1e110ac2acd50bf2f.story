Claims: According to court documents released Monday he told a roomate that he discovered her talking to another man on the phone before he blacked out and 'screwed up'

An affidavit filed in Kennebec County
Superior Court states that Pillsbury confessed to detectives that he 
stabbed and killed Jones, reported the Portland Press Herald.

A state medical examiner determined Jones, who was studying to be a 
beautician in Waterville,  suffered three wounds — one above the ear, 
one on the right side of the neck and one under her chin — according to 
the affidavit.

Pillsbury 
was charged with murder Friday afternoon at MaineGeneral Medical Center,
where he was being treated for self-inflicted stab wounds.

Emergency: A neighbour called the police to the flat on Wednesday evening

Killed: A state medical examiner determined Jones, who was studying to be a beautician in Waterville, suffered three wounds

Jones’ family members, including her father, a brother and a sister-in-law, attended the hearing Monday.

'The father is devastated,' said Deputy Attorney General William Stokes, who spent several minutes with Jones’ family after the hearing.

'They are a very nice family.'

On Sunday, Jones’ friend and a former roommate Brittney Kirk, 23, attended a vigil.

'She was a beautiful soul, a caring, loving and non-judgmental person,' said Kirk, of North Anson told the Online Sentinel.

'We used to say we were sisters always and forever and if we were writing it we would sign xxoo at the end,' she said.

Kirk said she met Pillsbury a few times and that he and Jones had been dating on-and-off for about two years.

They would be together for a few weeks or months, split up, and then get back together, she said.

Pillsbury is a flagger at road construction sites. He appeared in court with a large bandage under his chin and a bandage on his hand.
