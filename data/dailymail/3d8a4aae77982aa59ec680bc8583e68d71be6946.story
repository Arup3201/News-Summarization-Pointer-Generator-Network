The mask worn by the Lone Ranger is about to go on sale in Los Angeles, and is expected to fetch £40,000 at auction.

The custom-made prop was one of three used by actor Clayton Moore, who played the mysterious gunslinger in the 1950s TV show. He kept the mask until his death in 1999 when it was acquired by a private collector.

Martin Nolan, from Julien’s Auctions, said: ‘This mask is hugely iconic. It’s a true part of popular culture and we’ve been inundated with enquiries.’

Moore played The Lone Ranger from 1949 to 1951 when he left the show over a pay dispute.

Of the remaining masks, one is in the Smithsonian Institute’s National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. and the other belongs to Moore’s daughter Dawn.

Included in the sale is a letter from Dawn written in 2001 explaining the mask’s history.

Mr Nolan added: 'This mask was one of three that were custom made for Clayton for comfort and so he could see properly while doing his own stunts.

'This was his favourite out of the three, and the one he wanted to be sold after his death.

'It was auctioned in 2000 and now the vendor, a massive Lone Ranger fan, has decided to let someone else enjoy it.

'The Lone Ranger has a huge cult following and we have been inundated with enquiries about the mask.

'It is a true part of popular culture with worldwide interest.'

Hi Ho Silver! The Lone Ranger's tagline was usually followed by someone asking 'who was that masked man anyway?'

The Lone Ranger’s tagline was “Hi-Yo, Silver! Away!”, to which someone would ask “Who was that masked man, anyway?”

The character’s nickname was because he was the last of the Texas Rangers, rather than because he fought crime alone.

In fact, The Lone Ranger was often accompanied by his faithful sidekick Tonto, a Native American who referred to his companion as Kemo Sabe - or ‘trusty scout’.

After Moore quit the show he was replaced John Hart but he returned in 1954, playing the lead until it came to an end in 1957.

The auction will take place at Julien’s Auctions in Beverly Hills, California, on November 10.
