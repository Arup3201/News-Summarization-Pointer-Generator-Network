Body image: Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington said she would not rule out surgery to make her a 'pretty girl' admitting she does not feel comfortable with her appearance

Her body is her power, her strength and the root of her success.

As Britain's most successful swimmer ever, Rebecca Adlington's strong limbs have propelled her to Olympic glory.

But the 24-year-old today said while she hopes her achievements will inspire women struggling with their insecurities she would not rule out plastic surgery to make her a 'pretty girl'.

The swimmer, who hails from Mansfield, admits she does not feel comfortable in her body.

It is a body which has driven her to take part in four Olympic finals, winning two gold medals in Beijing and two bronze medals - one in Beijing and another at last summer's London games.

While on paper, Adlington should be brimming with confidence, a barrage of abuse inflicted by spiteful critics hiding behind their Twitter handles, has taken its toll.

‘Every day I look in the mirror and go, “God, I’m not pretty,” ’ she said.

‘I’ve got a very big nose. That’s what most of the negative comments on Twitter are about — my nose.

‘People say, “Oh God you look like a dolphin,” or “I didn’t realise they let whales into the Olympics, but at least you should be able to swim faster with a nose like that.”’

'I’ve always known I’m not particularly attractive. I don’t have high cheekbones and I’ve got big fishy lips. I don’t have a womanly figure — people say I’m butch . . . manly.’

She goes on. Her shoulders are 'too big', Her boobs are 'not big enough'. Her hips are 'getting bigger'.

Adlington's insecurities haunt her. And it is that insight into the mind of one of the most successful female Olympians this country has seen, which the now retired-swimmer hopes will help young girls.

In an interview with the Times Magazine she said it is important for women to realise that true beauty is not the slim image of perfection, so sought-after by celebrities.

She said she hopes her honesty will resonate with others, helping them in their battle with insecurity.

She said: 'I will always be insecure and I will always look in the mirror and wish I was a pretty girl.

'I was never one of those girls that got any attention. It never really bothered me because it was my swimming that gave me confidence.

Tears: The most successful British swimmer of all time broke down while filming ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, admitting she had always battled with insecurities about her body

Engaged: Adlington, who will marry her fiance, fellow swimmer Harry Needs next year, said any decision to have surgery would be hers and hers alone, adding Needs loves her whatever her size or shape

I am very aware that when I look in the mirror, it's not the person who I want to be.'

It was while she endured a stint in the Australian jungle for I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, the the public first got a glimpse of life inside the mind of the Olympic heroine.

She broke down in tears as she admitted she is unhappy with the way she looks,

In an interview with the Daily Mail after she was voted off the show, she said: 'I never went into swimming to be famous.
 Ask anyone — you don’t.

'And I didn’t expect it. It was the hardest 
thing to get used to, particularly people judging you. I thought: “Why 
are people judging me for the way I look?” It wasn’t as if I was trying 
to be a model.

‘I always had a bit of an insecurity about the way I looked growing up. I knew I wasn’t the most attractive girl at school.

'Even when I’ve been on a night out, no boys would want to talk to me. So those comments hurt.’ 

The 24-year-old, who retired from swimming in February, said she hopes her honesty will help others facing their own insecurities. Adlington left, after winning one of two gold medals, right, at the Beijing Olympics

But she is resolute, having plastic surgery is a step she would do for herself, and herself alone.

She knows her fiance and fellow swimmer Harry Needs adores her, whatever size or shape she is, but said considering surgery as an option is just her way of striving to be the best version of herself.

Adlington announced her retirement from the sport, which threw her into the spotlight, in February.

But leaving competitive pool behind her, Adlington's passion for swimming remains undiminished.

Indeed her next chapter is one she believes will present her biggest challenge yet, as she crafts her legacy to inspire generations of youngsters into the pool.

In a statement on her website she says: 'I'm very proud of what I have achieved so far, but my journey is not finished yet.

'My vision is that every child in Britain will be able to swim 25 metres by the time they leave primary school.

'Being able to swim is such a wonderful life skill, and I see this as my greatest challenge in swimming.'
