Two police officers visited the home of a married couple just one hour before they were stabbed to death, it was revealed today.

Pin Chang, 58, and his wife Quoi Chang, 50, were found with fatal injuries at their semi-detached house in Solihull, West Midlands, in the early hours of July 7.

A 23-year-old man, understood to be their son Carl Chang, was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains under police guard in hospital with serious injuries.

It is thought he will undergo a mental health assessment in the next few days.

West Midlands Police initially said officers were called to the Chang’s family home on leafy Hermitage Road just after 5am.

But today, it emerged that West Midlands Ambulance Service were first called to the semi-detached house at 3.39am that morning.

Paramedics alerted West Midlands Police and two officers arrived at the scene at 3.56am.

The officers then left the house at 4.48am after liaising with the ambulance team who also left at 5.06am.

It is currently unclear as to why the services left the address at this time.

But shockingly just 11 minutes later at 5.17am a 999 call was received from the Chang household and ambulance crews arrived back at the house at 5.26am.

The same two police officers then arrived at the property at 5.33am where they found the married couple with fatal stab wounds.

Now the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) are investigating West Midlands Police's handling of the incident.

West Midlands Police originally said they were called to the property at about 5am. However, the service has now said they actually arrived shortly before 4am - and left an hour later

A spokesperson for the watchdog said: 'The IPCC received a referral from West Midlands Police on 7 July relating to the deaths of Pin and Quoi Chang earlier that day.

'The referral was on a mandatory basis due to prior police contact.

'The IPCC received further information from West Midlands Police relating to the incident on the 11 July and we are currently assessing the level, if any, of IPCC involvement.'

Both West Midlands Police and West Midlands Ambulance confirmed the timings of the two visits but said all officers and crew involved remained at work.

Police have refused to name the 23-year-old man who has been arrested but he was named locally as the Chang’s eldest son Carl.

He lived at the address with his parents and two siblings, Joseph, 20, and Rebecca, 18, and attends Manchester Metropolitan University according to his Facebook page.

Last week neighbours spoke of their shock after the two bodies were found.

Theo Sotiriou, 35, who runs Theo’s Food opposite Hermitage Road, said: 'It is ironic that Solihull was actually voted the best place to live in the UK not so long ago and now look. It is really shocking.'

Neighbours - who have described the Changs as a 'quiet family' - have spoken of their shock at the deaths. Tributes were left at the scene following last week's attack (pictured)

Another 25-year-old neighbour said: 'They are a Chinese or Vietnamese family, the Changs.

'They have two sons, aged 23 and 20, and one daughter, who is 18. Carl is the elder son, then there is Joseph and Rebecca.

'They were a quiet family. You hardly see them really.

'They just keep themselves to themselves to be honest. It is such a shame, it is awful really.

'It is a lovely, quiet area and no-one expected anything like that.'

Another neighbour added: 'The mother was a very quiet woman. I believe there were two sons and a daughter who lived there. You hardly ever saw their father either.'
