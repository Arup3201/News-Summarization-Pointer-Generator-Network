The biggest surprise about FA general secretary Alex Horne leaving after 11 years with English football’s ruling body is that no scandal or controversy accompanies his departure.

Horne’s four predecessors - Ian Watmore, Brian Barwick , Mark Palios and Adam Crozier - either walked out (in Watmore’s case after just nine months) or were forced out.

However Horne, 42, appears to be leaving his £580,000-a-year post at the end of January for the reason he gave in his statement on Tuesday: ‘The time is right for me to look for a change of direction.’

With a City background, he will be able to match or better his FA salary, which made him the best-paid chief of any UK sports governing body. And his CV, that includes the opening of Wembley and St George’s Park, winning the Euro 2022 final and steering a very turbulent organisation into calmer waters, looks good.

But there is conjecture outside Wembley that FA chairman Greg Dyke is looking to reform the management as one of his strategic initiatives after the England Commission and Horne might have decided that this is the right time for a parting of the ways.

Horne, a methodical and organised executive, would have found Dyke, who shoots from the hip and tends to make up his mind on the hoof, a more difficult chairman to work with than his predecessor David Bernstein.

The Premier League are only just starting to look for a new chairman six months after City stalwart Anthony Fry suffered the stroke that forced him to quit. The PL’s audit and remuneration committee have taken their time because of complications with Fry’s lawyers and his family and they waited for chief executive Richard Scudamore to fully recover from heart surgery in the summer.

England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster has commissioned a video promoting England pride ahead of the World Cup which features patriotic Englishmen Bill Beaumont and Peter Winterbottom. But Lancaster is keeping the film, inspired by the way New Zealand and Wales utilise their national togetherness, in-house until after the Six Nations. He told a business audience in Leeds he doesn’t want any political ramifications over stressing English identity during a tournament involving all the home nations.

The upheaval at Silverstone has been such that the three senior executives - Richard Phillips, Ed Brookes and David Thompson - were escorted off the premises by security before starting suspensions on full pay from which they are not expected to return. The British Racing Drivers Club, who own the circuit, are conducting a root and branch investigation into a loss-making operation led by BRDC director Lawrence Tomlinson, care home tycoon and a Government business advisor, who has big motorsport interests.

It's been a nightmare fortnight for publishers with Hodder & Stoughton’s updated paperback edition of Sir Alex Ferguson’s autobiography being made public on Tuesday before Wednesday’s supposedly orchestrated release. This closely follows Orion’s Roy Keane book being sold by Tesco in Leyland, Lancashire before the publication date. The Hodder inquiry should start at Waterstones in Stockport.

Meanwhile, the four-day sports-writing festival at Lord’s this week is a highly admirable initiative. But it’s bizarre that former rugby hooker Brian Moore’s obscene book, What goes on tour stays on tour, that contains lyrics of rugby songs sure to offend many readers, has been given a prime promotional spot on Thursday night.

Following talks between sport, government and funding agencies, basketball is expected to receive the money in the next fortnight that will allow the British women’s team to compete in the European Championship. UK Sport’s zero tolerance towards sports with no medal potential in Rio brought about basketball’s cash problems. A UK Sport spokeswoman said: ‘We are in discussions with the DCMS and Sport England regarding what support can be offered to sports that fall outside our investment criteria.’
