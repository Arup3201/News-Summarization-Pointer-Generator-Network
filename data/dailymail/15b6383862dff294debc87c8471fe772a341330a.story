This is the first shocking image of the head injuries suffered by Tottenham Hotspur fan Ashley Mills in a bloody, apparently anti-semitic attack by hooligans in Rome last month.

Mr Mills, 25, was released from the San Camillo hospital today after receiving treatment for a head injury and a potentially fatal knife wound to his groin.

He was caught up in a brutal raid by hardcore Lazio and Roma fans on The Drunken Ship pub in the heart of the Italian capital on the eve of Tottenham's Europa League match on November 22.

As he left the hospital in a 
wheelchair today, Mr Mills would not comment on the attack in the Campo 
de'Fiori square, saying: 'I don't really want to talk about it... My leg
is getting a lot better now and that's the main thing.'

Dr Piergiorgio Cao said his femoral 
artery had been gashed and he risked losing his life had he not been 
operated on immediately.

Mr Mills, a builder from Essex, was flying back to London this afternoon.

Two Roma supporters involved in the attack have been banned from all football grounds for five years.

Francesco Ianiari, 26, and Mauro 
Pinnelli, 25, were arrested within ours of the raid on The Drunken Ship,
which left three Spurs fans seriously injured.

Both Ianiari and Pinnelli were charged with aggravated assault after an initial charge of attempted murder was dropped.

Around 50 masked men armed with 
knives, clubs, belts and sticks raided the bar, a popular meeting point 
for visiting fans, and were said to have chanted anti-semitic slogans 
against the Spurs fans during the ten minute raid.

It is believed Lazio and Roma fans put aside their traditional differences to attack the Britons.

Lazio president Claudio Lotito denied his side's fans were racist and said the attack was purely 'football related.'

He visited Mr Mills in hospital and presented him with a Lazio shirt with his name on.

The match, at the Stadio Olimpico, finished goalless.
