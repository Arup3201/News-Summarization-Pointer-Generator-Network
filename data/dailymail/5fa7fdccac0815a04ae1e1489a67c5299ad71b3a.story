Have you ever been to Dunstable?

The whole place is like a museum. And I don't mean that in a positive way. It's not all quaint cottages, and olde-world England. Far from it.

It's a grim relic of a bygone era, a town stuck in the past that may never catch up with the rest of the modern world.

The feisty Old Firm (pictured is Victor Wanyama seeing red in March 2012) is the biggest game in Scotland 

I lived there briefly, I think I'm all right now though.

The football equivalent of Dunstable is the Scottish domestic scene. People try to avoid it, there is nothing of interest there.

And the decline of Scottish club football has been brought into startling focus with this weekend's draw for the League Cup semi-finals.

When Celtic and Rangers were paired up for one of the ties, it instantly became the biggest game in the history of Scottish domestic football.

That might seem ridiculous but when you think it through, it's true.

The Glasgow derby games are always massive, and they're always the biggest games of the season. So that makes this one the biggest Scottish club football will see this campaign.

But it's so much more than that, and here are the reasons why it's the biggest fixture ever:

1) Never before has Scotland had to wait so long for an Old Firm clash. When this semi-final takes place, it will be two years and nine months since the last time Celtic and Rangers locked horns.

2) Never before have Rangers had such a massive point to prove. The fans feel they have been let down by the previous owners of the club, and those running the game north of the border.

3) Not for many years have Celtic been in such a shocking state. Strangers to the Champions League and scrapping their way back up the table, jostling for position with the likes of Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hamilton Academicals as they chase down Dundee United at the top. 

Neil Lennon preferred to be at Bolton at the foot of the Championship than slum it at Parkhead. It's a period of humiliation for the once-great Celtic Football Club. And while Rangers have been similarly humiliated, Celtic's embarrassment hasn't been imposed on them.

4) Never before has the Scottish domestic game been so moribund that literally everybody who cares about football in Scotland was desperate for this fixture to come in one of the cup competitions.

The circumstances both clubs find themselves in, and the hunger for a long-awaited, hotly-anticipated Old Firm game make this, in my opinion, the biggest club game in Scotland ever.

It's a sad state for Scottish football to find itself in.
