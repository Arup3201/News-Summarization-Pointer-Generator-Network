Charged: Former PCSO Peter Bunyan was found guilty at Taunton Crown Court of abusing his position to have affairs with five women while on duty

A police community support officer used the police database ‘as a dating agency’ to have affairs with single mothers and domestic abuse victims while on duty, a court heard.

Peter Bunyan accessed inside information to do background checks on women and their ex-partners after ‘welfare’ visits to victims of crime, it is alleged.

He is accused of neglecting his duties by turning his police radio off on shifts before having sex with women, including at a neighbourhood police office.

He is alleged to have urged a mentally ill woman to email explicit pictures of herself to the police station.

Married Bunyan, 40, a father of two, denies 12 counts of misconduct in a public office over a  five-year period.

Prosecutor Simon Burns told Taunton Crown Court yesterday: ‘If he was not in uniform or on duty, there would not be a trial.

‘But if on duty or in his uniform he should have been at work but he was in bed with somebody, he was not exercising his proper role as a police officer. ’

Bunyan, of Carharrack, Cornwall, admits he had sex with four women but said it was off duty.

He denies sex with a fifth woman. All five say the sex was consensual.

Mr Burns said of Bunyan’s use of the  police database: ‘You do not use the criminal intelligence system as a dating agency.’

Peter Bunyan, an officer with Devon 
and Cornwall Police, is alleged to have accessed highly sensitive police
 data to perform background checks on women and their former partners 
after so-called 'welfare' visits to victims of crime.

He
 is accused of neglecting his duties by turning his police radio down on
 shifts before having sex with women, including at a police 
neighbourhood office, as well as encouraging one mentally ill woman to 
send explicit pictures of herself on email to the police station.

Bunyan, a father-of-two, denies 12 
counts of misconduct in a public office, taking place over a five-year 
period in the Camborne and Redruth areas of west Cornwall.

On trial: Police community support officer Peter Bunyan (pictured, left, outside court and, right, in his uniform) is accused of using highly sensitive police data to strike up affairs with vulnerable women while on duty

The case is being held at Taunton Crown Court, Somerset, out of the Devon and Cornwall Police force area.

Prosecutor
 Simon Burns told the jury: 'This is not a court of morals. You will 
hear all sorts of sordid details in relation to this case.

'He
 (Bunyan) has abused his position as a police officer by targeting women
 - targeting vulnerable women - and conducting inappropriate sexual 
relationships with them while on duty.

'He has behaved, while on duty as a police officer, inappropriately and unprofessionally.

'Not only was he in his full uniform... but occasionally even turned down or off his police radio.'

Mr Burns said Bunyan had sex with women at various locations, including at a neighbourhood police office.

Bunyan
 also accessed the police database, where he was able to find highly 
personal details about people in the community, including the women he 
targeted, the court heard.

Mr
 Burns added: 'He used that confidential information, which is not 
allowed to be simply looked at by a police officer, unless they have a 
lawful reason for doing so.

'You
 don’t look up somebody simply to be nosy, to look at where they live, 
to look for their telephone numbers. He abused the police computer 
system to his own advantage.

'You do not use the criminal intelligence system as a dating agency.'

Mr Burns said the public expected PSCOs such as Bunyan to protect them on the streets, 'not to be in bed with them'.

Mr Burns said Bunyan’s first affair was with a woman who had some mental health issues.

She
 was later sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The woman previously 
had reason to call the police following a dispute with someone.

Another
 woman struck up a relationship with Bunyan after he went to her home to
 take a witness statement when she was a victim of domestic violence.

But
 the statement took “an inordinate amount of time to complete”, the 
court heard. Bunyan then started to ask the woman intimate questions 
about her body. 

The
 couple developed a relationship, which in one case saw Bunyan collect 
the single mother from a firework display and take her to a 
neighbourhood police office where they had sex.

The woman said Bunyan had been on duty - something Mr Burns said the PCSO later admitted.

Redruth police station, where Bunyan would openly view explicit pictures of his victims

Bunyan is said to have “encouraged” 
the women to post naked pictures of themselves - some pornographic - to 
his local police station.

Colleagues of the PCSO told the jury 
how he “clearly appreciated” the images, which were sent on CDs and 
viewed by Bunyan on the police computer at Redruth police station.

PCSO Karen Moreley, who worked with Bunyan for a year, said he was sent images of naked women regularly.

She told the jury: 'There were topless images and images using mirrors.

'He clearly appreciated these images and would laugh and joke and check the mail to see if any discs arrived.

'I found him quite forthcoming to women, quite creepy and unprofessional.'

Bunyan admits having sex with four women, who include single mothers, women in their 20s, and victims of domestic abuse, but said it was off duty.

He denies sex with a fifth woman. All five say the sex was consensual.

Bunyan denies 12 counts of misconduct in a public office and his trial, expected to last up to three weeks, continues.

The officer has been suspended by Devon and Cornwall police.

The trial continues.
