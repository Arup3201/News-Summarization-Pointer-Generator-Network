UK retail giant Marks & Spencer is set to open its first Australian store this year.

The $13billion British chain will expand Down Under, following the lead of Zara and Topshop, which opened in the country in 2011 and 2012 respectively and Sweden’s H&M and Japan’s Uniqlo, due to open in 2014.

M&S executives have already appointed two directors to head up the Australian arm of the business with plans to launch smaller scale shops rather than huge department stores.

Headed Down Under: Marks and Spencer are entering the Australian retail market later this year. They are known for their lavish advertising campaigns, including this one starring Helen Mirrren (in white and black check coat, front right)

These will measure approximately 2,000 square metres, about a fifth of the size of their usual footfall or Australian department stores Myer and David Jones. 

In a small-format store, fashion and beauty take up approximately 80 per cent of floor space, with food accounting for the remaining 20 per cent.

The directors are Anthony Clarke, an assistant company secretary of the M&S Group parent company in the UK, and Melissa Lovell, a corporate lawyer at oil and gas company Santos.

Heading Down Under: UK retail giant, Marks & Spencer are set to open a store in Australia this year

Both are employed by Marks & Spencer (Australia) Pty Ltd, a corporate entity that has been inactive for almost seven years.

It is understood that agents for the retailer are currently searching for a space in Sydney and have examined several sites on George Street in the centre of the city.

The retailer has identified international expansion as a key goal.

It currently has more than 440 stores operating in more than 50 territories across Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Last year, the company announced plans to more than double the number of stores in India from 36 to 80 by 2016.

It already has 16 outlets in Hong Kong and 10 in Singapore, and has been looking to enter the Australian market for some time.

Despite multimillion pound advertising campaigns fronted by models and stars such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Helen Mirren, the company has been struggling for some time.

In the last three years, it has repeatedly reported falling sales of general merchandise, which includes clothing and homewares, while food sales remain strong.

M&S reported its pre-tax profits for the first half of 2013 were down 9 per cent compare to the previous year, falling from £289.5million to £261.1million.

In December, City broker UBS downgraded its UK profit forecasts for M&S – a move which saw the value of M&S shares slump by 10.8p to 441.5p, knocking £178million off its stock market value in a single day.
