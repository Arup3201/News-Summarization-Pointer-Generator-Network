Most people struggle to manage a flip on a skateboard, let alone 360s and daring jumps, but 26-year-old Italo Romano does all that and more - with no legs.

Italo, from Curitiba, Brazil, lost his legs in an accident as a teenager but he has not let his disability define him or limit his abilities.

Using his hands to speed up the board, he turns his urban surroundings into a skate park, flipping and grinding on park benches and sidewalks.

When he was 13, Italo was playing a dangerous game with his friends, daring each other to ride between train carriages.

Italo fell through and lost both his legs, yet when he took up skateboarding a few years later, there was nothing that could stop him.

Today he is rated among the top extreme sportsmen in his home country and made the semi-finals at the Tampa Pro 2012 competition in Tampa, Florida
