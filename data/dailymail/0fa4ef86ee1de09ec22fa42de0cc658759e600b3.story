Parents: Joshua Bridgeman, who stole £176,000 to fund his gambling addiction, with Jess Sullivan

A young bank manager who stole £176,000 from his employers to fund his gambling addiction has been jailed.

Joshua Bridgeman, 28, took the money while working at Barclays Bank after becoming hooked on online casino gambling and fixed odds betting terminals.

The father-of-one, who is the son of a policeman, pocketed up to £6,000 a month by making fictitious transfers between accounts and volunteering to work on Saturdays, when he had easy access to cash.

Bridgeman, who became assistant manager at the bank’s Ely branch in Cambridgeshire and was sent to work in other branches as a troubleshooter, was caught after an internal investigation in March 2012 found that he had plundered £176,000 since 2007.

He created a huge amount of false documents to move cash between accounts.

Bridgeman, from Cottenham, near Cambridge, was able to get away with his scam for years as he knew the system, having worked for the bank since he left school.

Bridgeman, who previously played as a 
midfielder for his local team Cottenham United, even offered to work on 
Saturdays at his branch to pocket extra cash.

When he was finally caught and charged with theft, he denied stealing any money.

He admitted falsifying documents but 
said he did so in an effort to get to the bottom of an error he had 
discovered.

However, he was convicted following a trial at Cambridge 
Crown Court and jailed for three years.

Bridgeman has a 19-month-old daughter with Jess Sullivan, 27.

Joshua Bridgeman stole £176,000 to fund his gambling addiction. He has been jailed for three years

Since leaving the bank, he has run a lettings and property firm.

In 2002, his brother Jonathon was jailed for almost four years for causing death by careless driving after he hit a cyclist.

Last night Barclays said that no customers’ money was lost because of the theft.

Det Con Sharon Garrett said the jury had seen through lies told by Bridgeman.

She said: 'Bridgeman was a highly valued and trusted member of the bank.

'He had worked his way up to assistant manager and would be sent to other branches as a trouble-shooter.

'He
 knew the systems inside out having worked for the bank since leaving 
school and was able to use that knowledge to stay under the radar for 
some time.

'He stole a huge amount of money and the sentence shows how seriously such a breach of trust is taken by the courts.'

No customers lost money from Bridgeman’s scam and after leaving Barclays he ran a lettings and property management firm in Cottenham.
