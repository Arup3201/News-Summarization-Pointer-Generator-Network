A young woman woke from a life-threatening seizure to discover she'd given birth to a 1lb baby.

Gemma Jamieson, 23,  collapsed and suffered a huge fit when she was just 24 weeks pregnant.

While she lay unconscious, doctors battled to deliver her baby and save both their fragile lives.

Remarkably, Mrs Jamieson survived her ordeal, but woke up three days later with no memory of giving birth to the little boy she had carried for six months.

Miss Jamieson, from Hull, East Yorkshire, said: 'I remember waking up and my husband, Dale, showing me a picture of a baby on his phone, and explaining it was our son.

'I couldn't believe it - I had no memory of giving birth - it was all so surreal.

'I felt robbed of the experience of pregnancy as I hadn't even felt our baby kick.

Gemma Jamieson, 23, woke up from a near-fatal seizure and discovered she'd given birth to her baby son, Tyler. The pair are pictured, with Tyler now s 17 months old

Mrs Jamieson (right) had no idea she'd had a Caesarean section to give birth to Tyler. She and husband Dale, 24 (left), had been at a car festival when she suffered a seizure and was rushed to hospital

Tyler was born prematurely and weighing just 1lb. He was rushed to another hospital for treatment as his lungs had not developed properly. He is pictured here at three weeks old, when doctors said he had a one in ten chance of survival. He underwent a heart operation and 17 blood transfusions a week later

'Dale told me how much our baby weighed, how old he was, that he was very poorly and being treated in a different hospital.

'I couldn't believe what had happened, to know that I'd missed out on his birth, and that all our relatives had seen him before me was almost too much to bear.

'Giving birth is one of the biggest moments of a women's life - and I missed it.

'I just wanted to see him straight away and make sure he was OK.'

Slowly, Mrs Jamieson recovered from the near fatal pre-eclampsia that had caused her seizures.

Pre-eclamsia affects five per cent of pregnant women, causing high blood pressure and swelling in the feet, ankles and hands.

Only one to two per cent develop severe complications like the convulsions Mrs Jamieson suffered.

After an agonising seven day wait while she recovered, she finally met her son, Tyler, now 17 months. 

She said: 'Dale led me into a room full of newborn babies and I had to ask which was ours.

'But as soon as I saw Tyler I burst into tears - I felt bonded with him immediately.

'All my energy was focused on him and helping him get better.' 

The ordeal ordeal began when Mr and Mrs Jamieson attended a car festival in July last year.

Pre-eclamsia affects some pregnant women, usually during the second half of pregnancy (from around 20 weeks) 

It causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine  - signs that should be picked up during routine antenatal check-ups.

Occasionally, symptoms can include swelling in the feet, ankles and hands, vision problems headaches and pain just below the ribs.

Although the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, it is thought to occur when there is a problem with the placenta. 

If left untreated it can cause the convulsions that Mrs Jamieson experienced. 

Although most cases of pre-eclampsia cause no problems and improve soon after the baby is delivered, there is a risk of serious complications that can affect both the mother and  baby.

There is a risk the mother will develop fits called eclampsia. 

These fits can be life threatening for the mother and the baby, but they are rare.

'Gemma was sitting in the car and she shouted at me because her shoulder was twitching,' Mr Jamieson recalls.

'It just suddenly escalated and she was having a big fit.

'I just couldn't believe what was happening.

'She must have bit down on her tongue because it swelled up and she was having trouble breathing.

'I managed to give her mouth to mouth - the paramedics said that if I hadn't been there she might not have even made it to the hospital.'

After being rushed to hospital, Mrs Jamieson began to have her second violent seizure which doctors later discovered was as a result of pre-eclampsia.

It was then that doctors explained that the only chance of saving her life, was to deliver her baby early.

Mrs Jamieson said: 'I vaguely remember arguing with the doctors because I didn't want them to deliver Tyler so early.

'But the doctors told me I was in severe danger - minutes away from death - and I needed to get to theatre.

'I was then in and out of consciousness for the next three days.

'I don't remember giving birth to Tyler or seeing him at all.

'I have no memory of what happened.'

Tyler was delivered by Caesarean section while both his and Mrs Jamieson's life hung in the balance.

Mr Jamieson said: 'When Tyler was born, Gemma was totally out of it.

'They told me his chances of survival were really slim, it was just awful.

'Tyler was then transferred to a different hospital and I just spent the days going in between the two.

'It was awful to see Gemma so ill, knowing that she had a baby that she'd never ever met.'

Tyler not only underwent a heart operation, but 17 blood transfusions and five rounds of laser eye surgery to save his sight. Doctors said he had a 98 per cent chance of being blind, but parents are thrilled he now has driving standard eyesight. He is pictured here recovering at home with his mother

Tyler's parents call him their 'little miracle' as he survived against the odds and is now healthy. Mr Jamieson called his wife and his son 'incredible'

Over the next few days doctors finally managed to stabilize her, but despite her quick recovery, little Tyler faced a long battle ahead, with just a one in ten chance of survival.

Mrs Jamieson said: 'Tyler is really the fighter in all of this.

'He was born at just 24 weeks and was so premature that his lungs hasn't developed properly, so he was battling chronic lung disease.

'He had to have 17 blood transfusions, and was really struggling to survive.

'When I first saw him his skin was almost see through and he tubes coming out of him everywhere.

'He was on a ventilator and had a hat on him - all I could do was stroke him as he had to stay in his incubator.'

Little Tyler then went on a year long journey in order to recover.

Mrs Jamieson said: 'To begin with Tyler was very ill.

'He had to go to Great Ormond Street for a heart operation when he was just 4 weeks old.

'Then we were told he had a 98 per cent chance of been blind and he underwent five lots of laser eye surgery.

'Dale and I were warned on more than one occasion that he may not make it.

'But over time he just seemed to get better and better.

'Slowly but surely he began to breathe on his own.

'When he was six months old, we finally got to take him home and it was the best day ever.

'His eye sight is now as good as driving standard which is a miracle.

'He's gone from strength to strength and about three weeks before his first birthday in July, he finally came off his oxygen for good.'

Mrs Jamieson and Dale are now enjoying time at home with their healthy son.

Dale said: 'It's amazing to think that after everything they've both through they're both here to tell the tale.

'I could have lost them both so I feel lucky to have my family here.

'They're incredible.'
