Millionaire lingerie boss Michelle Mone has called for inheritance tax to be axed to stop the government spending her money when she dies.

The mother-of-three, who owns the £50million Ultimo push up bra firm, said the tax on money and property left to loved ones was ‘unfair and should be abolished’.

The plea came after David Cameron hinted the Tory party manifesto at the next election will exempt all estates worth up to £1million.

Ultimo boss Michelle Mone said inheritance tax was unfair and should be abolished so people can leave their money to their children or charities

Rising house prices mean the number of families paying the 40 per cent levy will double to one in ten over the next five years.

Under current rules a single person can leave £325,000 tax-free, while couples have a joint threshold of £650,000.

But Mrs Mone, who divorced last year, called for an end to death taxes, insisting she had already paid tax on her earnings in life.

‘I work really hard every single day - like a lot of people - for my children and for my children’s future,’ she told BBC 2’s Newsnight.

‘I want them to have that little nest for their future and for their children, and I don't see why I, others should work extremely hard, pay your tax and then when you die it is like a double whammy.

‘House prices are rising which means that there is a lot more people who have to pay inheritance tax. It is unfair and should be abolished.

‘I certainly don’t want the government deciding what to do with my money when I am dead.’

Mrs Mone said her earings were taxed in lfie and should not be taxed again in death

Last year Mrs Mone wrested control of her business empire from the hands of her former husband Michael after agreeing to buy his share for an estimated £24million.

She said she had already written her will, which would see her wealth passed to her children in stages.

‘I am bringing my children up with that hardworking, want to succeed background. My kids don’t suddenly get the case. My kids get it at stages in life, hopefully they went get it until late in life and I will live forever.

‘That’s what I want to do. I want to work hard in order to make my children’s future a bit easier in order that they have got that nest, that they are protected.

‘I have three children. I am a single parent and I don’t want my kids struggling. I also don’t want them to be spoilt.

‘I think I should decide what I do with my money.  I have already got my will there for my children and to give part of it to charity and everything else.

‘The government should not be taxing me again when I have already paid tax for it.

‘It is unfair and there is a lot more people who have to pay inheritance tax now because house prices are rising and you pay it on your whole estate.’

Some people are forced to sell the family home when one member dies to pay the inheritance tax bill, she said.

‘I have heard some horror stories where someone has lived in the family home for 20-25 years and they have to actually move out of the family home to pay the tax.’

Many parents also want to provide their children with a nest egg for big life expenses, like going to university.

Mrs Mone went on: ‘If the worst scenario happens sometime they pay the tax on the estate, they cannot even afford to go to university. They cannot afford to live the life that people with lots of money do.’

She was appearing on the programme with musician and businessman Peter Buffett, the son of magnate Warren Buffett who is worth an estimated $58billion.

Peter Buffet insisted he had made his own way in life without relying on his father’s wealth/

‘It comes down to the question of how much is enough. That is why I definitely agree with my father and have experienced it myself. I believe self-respect comes from earning its own reward,’ he told the programme.

‘I am very proud of the world I have built myself. I think if I lived off my father’s wealth or do in the future I am going to frankly wonder if I could have done it myself.’

However his argument was undermined when he admitted that as a young man he had been given shares in his father’s firm worth $250,000 in today’s money.

This week Mr Cameron suggested the Tories could go further to target older voters, with an increase in the inheritance tax threshold planned for the manifesto.

Before the 2010 election the Conservatives promised to raise it to £1million, freeing most families from paying the duty at all.

But the idea was a victim of the power-sharing talks with the Lib Dems and never became coalition policy.

Mr Cameron insisted the idea would be resurrected ahead of the 2015 election.

Prime Minister David Cameron said he wanted to increase the amount of money people can leave loved ones without being hit by inheritance tax

Speaking to Saga members in Peacehaven, near Brighton, East Sussex, the Prime Minister said: ‘Would I like to go further in future? Yes, I would.

‘I believe in people being able to pass money down through the generations and pass things on to their children. I think you build a stronger society.’

He added: ‘Inheritance tax should only be paid for by the rich. It shouldn't be paid for by people who have worked hard and saved, and bought a family house in, say, Peacehaven.

‘So the ambition is still there and I would like to go further. It's better than it was, but it didn't make it into the coalition agreement. It's something we will have to address in our manifesto.’
