Charlie Sheen has escalated his vicious tirades against ex-wife Denise Richards in a nasty tweet Monday that also incorporated his distaste for embattled Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson.

Just two days before Christmas, Charlie, 48, tweeted a vile bestiality slur that suggested Denise, 42, should marry Robertson, who has been suspended from his A&E series over anti-gay remarks he made in a GQ profile.

The tweet read: 'I came up with a PERFECT holiday idea! Denise and Phil Robertson should get married! then he can practice the Bestiality he hates! c :).'

This was a followup to a series of text messages, reported by TMZ, that called Richards 'heartless' and 'ugly' and accused her of preventing him from seeing his daughters.

Two birds, one stone: Charlie Sheen managed to spew venom at both Denise and Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson in one tweet

One of Charlie's texts, which were obtained by TMZ, said 'lemme see if I got this straight; you won't even spring the girls for 30 mins, from the 10 mil house I gave you, (100 yds away) to come down and open the gifts their dad bought them before they leave??'

He went on, saying: 'I hope your stocking is bronze-age coal stuffed along with an assortment of 8x10's of yours so you can see how despicable and heartlessly ugly you and your fermented soul continue to be.'

Charlie also claims that Denise, mother to Charlie's daughters Sam, nine, and Lola, eight, as well as adopted daughter Eloise, two, had 
the 'audacity' to ask him to borrow his private jet to go on the big 
family trip he says he wasn't invited on.

He claims went to Denise's home to 
take gifts to his girls and to plead with her to change her mind, but 
that Denise would not allow him to see the kids.

Charlie concludes, 'This is the worst Xmas I've ever had.'

Denise took the high road with a series of Twitter responses later Monday, denying Charlies claims and pleading with him to stop.

When a follower asked Denise why she would not let Charlie see the girls, Denise replied: 'Thats actually not true. I don't know why he feels the need to do this publicly. I don't keep him away from our kids.'

She then sent Charlie two tweets disputing his claims and asking him to stop.

In the first tweet she told him he was welcome to spend the holidays with her and the girls: '@charliesheen U done ranting? keep it classy dude.Our kids don't need to be privy to this,U are welcome 2 spend xmas w/us Hope u still come.'

Then she pleaded with him to stop his attacks: '@charliesheen u were & are welcome 2 see them. I never asked 4 your plane. we love u. Please 4 our kids stop this....'

Strike out: Charlie posted this shot on Instagram last week showing a chopped up baseball bat that he and Denise had received as a wedding gift in 2002

Today's rants are just the latest salvos in Charlie's war on Denise.

A little over a week ago, the 
48-year-old actor encapsulated his vengeful feelings toward his second 
ex-wife in a shocking photo he posted to Instagram. 

It
 showed a chopped up baseball bat that they had received as a wedding 
gift in 2002. The inscription read: 'Congratulations Denise & 
Charlie, June 15, 2002, Have a home run of a life.'

In addition, he tweeted, 'The lie is over. Iâ€™m done being treated like a relative with a one-way ticket. #DuhNeese.'

Last Tuesday TMZ reported the former 
Two And A Half Men star wanted to hit the former Bond girl in the 
pocketbook by significantly reducing her $55,000 a month child support 
payments.

The Anger Management star is also looking to get more time with his young daughters.

'Charlie's going to court,' the site reported.

'Not
 only does he want child support reduced, he wants the judge to 
establish his iron-clad right to see his kids on specific holidays.'

According to a report on RadarOnline, 
Charlie and Denise's seemingly strained relationship is due to the 
actor's new porn star girlfriend, Brett Rossi.

According
 to the report, the 24-year-old adult film star issued an ultimatum to 
her new beau that he cut off ties with Richards if he wants to keep the 
new relationship going.

Brooke
 Mueller, 36, who was married to Charlie from 2008 to 2011 and is mother to 
Charlie's four-year-old twin boys, Max and Bob, lost custody of the kids
 in May. RadarOnline reports that the children were taken away after 
Brooke was place on psychiatric hold following a drug overdose.

Denise was caring for the twins, but
 was forced to give them up because of their alleged violent behavior 
toward her daughters. In a distressing letter to child protective 
services, she explained the harrowing situation.

According
 to Denise, her 'daughters have been strangled, kicked in the head and 
stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face and head, and spit
 on' by the boys, as have the family dogs, reported Radar.

The twins have since been placed in the care of Brooke's brother, Scott Mueller.

Charlie is allowed to see the boys for two monitored visits per week, each lasting two hours.

The
 LADCFS have been considering placing the boys in foster care, away from
 both parents, at which point Denise stepped in and said she would take 
them again rather than let that happen.

The custody case is still under review.
