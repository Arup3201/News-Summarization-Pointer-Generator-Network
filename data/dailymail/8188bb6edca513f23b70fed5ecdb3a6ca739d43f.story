Holidaymakers on a budget certainly won't be kicking up a stink about this hotel.

A unique concept is offering travellers to Germany and Austria accommodation in refurbished sewer pipes.

The Das Park hotel has converted the 6ft-tall, 9.5tonne concrete structures into cosy rooms that include double beds, luggage space and even power points to charge mobile phones and digital cameras.

They even feature wall paintings which have been created by Austrian artist Thomas Latzel Ochoa.

However, there are no windows - apart from a small circular airhole near to the top of the pipes - and guests must use toilets and showers in local public buildings.

Tourists can book the hotel rooms for up to three nights free of charge, or they can offer to pay 'whatever they can afford' to support the project. The hotel is currently only open from May to October.

A spokesman for Das Park said: 'The pipe's stark and minimalist exterior contrasts with the high levels of comfort in the interior.

'It's a hotel room that's as simple as a locker. Thanks to its minimalist design, Das Park Hotel is particularly simple to maintain and operate.

There are three 'suites' located in a public park in the Austrian city of Ottensheim, while there are five suites located in Bernepark, Germany (pictured)

'The surrounding area is incorporated into the overall concept through the use of local infrastructure and through co-operation with local businesses.

'For operators, Das Park Hotel is a low cost and unique type of accommodation that is consciously integrated into its local economic environment, creating a very special kind of travel destination.

'Hotel guests enjoy a hip and unconventional overnight stay in exciting designer surroundings, and an entirely different kind of hotel experience. 

'Novel, minimalist accommodation concepts are becoming more and more sought-after; one of the reasons why Das Park Hotel is so popular with its guests.'

There are three 'suites' located in a public park in the Austrian city of Ottensheim, while there are five suites located in Bernepark, near Essen in Germany.

Guests are required to book their rooms at the hotel's website. Upon acceptance of the booking, guests receive a code to unlock the door to their pipe. 

The thick cement keeps the interior comfortable and eliminates noise from outside while the concrete walls are cool on hot days and comfortably warn in winter.
