Plea: Mary Queen of Scots sent a letter begging for her life

The fragile parchment, bearing royal insignia, was sent to a pope by a deposed monarch begging for her life.

While the letter addressed to Sixtus V failed to save Mary, Queen of Scots from the executioner’s sword, the document itself has survived buried in the bowels of the Vatican’s secret archives for more than 400 years.

It is among 100 of the most historically significant items of confidential correspondence due to go on public display for the first time in a special exhibition in Rome.

The priceless collection spans more than a millennium, from the eighth century to modern times, and features a cast of historical characters who have crossed swords with a succession of pontiffs, from Knights Templar to Galileo, Martin Luther and Henry VIII.

Mary wrote the missive from her prison cell at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire just three months before she was executed following her long incarceration.

The letter was written in French on 
November 23, 1586. In it the Catholic Mary asks for forgiveness for her 
sins, but also rails against perceived falsehoods perpetrated by her 
enemies in England and warns the Pope of treacherous cardinals.

She claims the tribunal that condemned her to death was illegitimate and
 also recounts the suffering she had undergone during nearly 20 years of
 imprisonment under the rule of her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth I.

Mary had fled to England after an unsuccessful attempt to regain the 
throne in Scotland. She initially sought protection from Elizabeth, but 
because of the threat she was thought to have posed as the focus of 
Catholic plotters who considered her the rightful ruler of England, she 
was instead imprisoned before being tried for treason.

Any hopes that the Pope would come to her rescue were dashed when Mary 
was put to death  at Fotheringhay at 8am on February 8, 1587.

The priceless document is normally kept with tens of thousands of others
 on 50 miles of shelves in climate-controlled rooms in the Vatican’s 
Apostolic Palace, as well as in a high-security underground bunker.

Archivists have gathered them together for an exhibition to be held in 
Rome’s Capitoline Museums to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the 
founding of the Secret Archives in their present form.

Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican’s official spokesman, said: ‘It’s 
an exceptional event. Never have so many documents from the Secret 
Archives been allowed to leave the Vatican.’

British visitors to the exhibition, entitled Lux in Arcana: The Vatican 
Secret Archives Revealed, may be equally interested in an appeal by the 
British Parliament asking the Pope to annul Henry VIII’s marriage to 
Catherine of Aragon.

Sent to Pope Clement VII in 1530, it failed to resolve the dispute, 
which eventually led to religious schism and the founding of the Church 
of England.

It will be displayed alongside documents from the heresy trial of 
Galileo Galilei, whose scientific theories that the Earth revolved 
around the Sun attracted the hostility of the Catholic Church in the 
early 17th century.

Spoilt and petulant: Lord Darnley

Born on the 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace Mary became Queen of Scots when she was six days old.

As Hendry VII of England's great-granddaughter she was next in line to the English throne, after Henry VIII's children.

She was due to marry Henry VIII's son, the future Edward VI after Scottish nobility decided to make peace with England, however, it was opposed by the Catholics and she was taken to Stirling Castle.

Scotland returned to its traditional ally, France and Mary later married the French King Henri II's heir, Dauphin Francis on 24 April 1558.

He succeeded to his father's throne in 1559 - making Mary Queen of France as well as Scotland but his reign was brief and he died in 1560 of an ear infection.

The following year Mary decided to return to Scotland - which was now a Protestant country, after religious reforms led by John Knox.

She was a Roman Catholic and was assured by her half-brother Lord James Stewart that she would be allowed to worship as she wished when she returned in August 1561.

At first she ruled successfully and was advised by James and William Maitland of Lethington. But her marriage in 1565 to her second cousin Henry, Lord Darnley (who was the great-grandson of Henry VII) started a series of tragic events.

Darnley, who was spoilt and petulant, had became the focus of her enemies and their relationship became difficult. The birth of their son, James, did little to improve it and when Darnley was murdered in 1567, people began to suspect she was involved.

Her marriage three months later to the Earl of Bothwell - who was generally believed to be the murderer - brought her ruin and Protestant Lords rose against her in a battle at Carberry Hill, near Edinburgh, on June 15 1567.

She later surrendered and was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle, Kinross-shire and forced to abdicate in favour of her son. Bothwell had fled but was arrested and held prisoner until his death.

Mary escaped from Lochleven in 1568 and after another failed battle went to England where she hoped Queen Elizabeth I would support her cause but she was kept in captivity in England for 19 years.

A number of Roman Catholic plots against Queen Elizabeth led her minister's to demand Mary's execution. 

She was executed at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire on Feburary 8 1587, aged 44.

Mary, Queen of Scots was buried in Peterborough Cathedral but in 1612 her son James VI had her body exhumed and placed in the vault of King Henry VII's Chapel in Westminster Abbey.
