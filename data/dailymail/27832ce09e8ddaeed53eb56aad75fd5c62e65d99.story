Sally Sinclair was stabbed more than 30 times by her husband Alisdair after she admitted having an affair

Two boys whose mother was brutally killed by their father have had to hand over their inheritance to pay for the cost of cleaning the bloodstains.

Sally Sinclair was stabbed 30 times by her controlling husband Alisdair in a horrific 20-minute knife attack.

After the tragedy her twin sons stood to inherit her £13,000 assets.

But the entire amount has had to be handed to the landlords of the family’s rented mansion to cover blood-spattered furnishings and other damage.

Owners Patrick and Maureen Langdown had launched a £92,000 legal action over losses resulting from Mrs Sinclair’s killing in 2008.

An itemised damage claim included £4,555 for new carpets, £782 for  dry-cleaning blood-stained curtains and £2,100 for redecorating bloodied walls at £900,000 Kiln House in Amport, Hampshire.

Another £15,446.06 was attributed to ‘blight’ – with the Langdowns claiming Mrs Sinclair’s death had caused both the value of the property and its rental income to plunge.

Now Mrs Sinclair’s mother Nikki Alford has made the decision to hand over her grandchildren’s inheritance in return for the landlords abandoning legal action.

Alisdair Sinclair, who was jailed for nine years for the manslaughter of his wife, has already been released after serving half his sentence. He is believed to have no assets.

Mrs Alford, 64, was appalled by the Langdowns’ legal action after her daughter’s death. She said: ‘The £13,000 value of her estate was all she could leave to her children.

‘She died intestate but they would have had that money. Then we found we had to give it away.

‘We just couldn’t believe it. The Langdowns were perfectly within their legal rights but whether it was ethical .  .  . well, it wasn’t, was it?

‘How could anyone do that to children. It doesn’t matter whether the law was on their side or what damage had been caused.’

Mrs Alford said lawyers had advised that paying the £13,000 under a ‘deed of assignment’ was the only way to avoid further liability. So she agreed for fear that her grandchildren might be saddled with expensive legal fees in future years.

At his trial in 2009, the jury heard how Mr Sinclair, now 52, was a house husband who ruthlessly controlled his 40-year-old wife, a Vodafone executive. Winchester Crown Court was told that he was ‘a man in a jealous rage who did not want to let go’ after his wife admitted having an affair and sought a divorce.

At the time of Mrs Sinclair’s death, Mr Langdown told one newspaper: ‘It is tragic. It is horrible. This is a new experience to us in a private quiet hamlet. My feelings are with the family and children.’

Despite the Langdowns’ claim that the killing would affect the future price of Kiln House, evidence  suggests it has actually increased  in value.

Papers submitted to Test Valley Borough Council show that the house was worth around £825,000 in February 2009. By April 2011, it was valued at £900,000.

When The Mail On Sunday attempted to contact Mr Langdown at his farmhouse in Amport, he declined to explain why he had pursued compensation from Mrs Sinclair’s estate.

A woman who said she was his daughter told us: ‘I’m afraid my father has no comment to make.’
