When a businessman from Brisbane was offered the once in a lifetime opportunity to meet President Barack Obama he knocked it back for one sole reason – his wife wasn’t invited to come along too.

Devoted husband Phil Hogan, who has been married to Michelle for almost 21 years, said he made a vow a long time ago that weekends were for family time and he wouldn't go anywhere without his beloved.

‘I’ve been in hospitality all my life and have been invited to a lot of things but the number one most important thing in my life is my family.

‘I worked out way back a rule that weekends are for family time, I don’t go to anything unless my wife is invited,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Hogan, seen here holding his former business partner Pat Rafter's favourite rum bottle before a game of Veterans Rugby, said he turned down meeting President Obama because he wants to see his wife

Mr Hogan received an invitation from the White House on Monday to attend a speech given by the US President on Saturday morning in Brisbane, as part of Obama's visit to Australia for the G20 summit, and he immediately emailed to ask if he could bring his wife along too.

The bar owner, who runs Jade Buddha in Brisbane’s city centre, revealed his wife ‘was annoyed’ that he’d turned down the opportunity for her.

‘She’ll love me for it really though and it wasn’t up to her, it was up to me,’ he said.

Mr Hogan wrote a polite email response to the White House, in which he stated ‘I’m a big fan and everything’, explained his family policy and how his wife is a solicitor who once worked for the DPP for women and children.

‘My point being that she’s not a terrorist or anything. I asked politely if they could swing us an extra invite,’ he laughed.

Mrs Hogan is now a stay-at-home mum who helps raise their four children - Chloe, Ella, Patrick and Abbey.

‘They said it was against security protocol as the guest list had already been closed off. I said “that’s fine, no worries”.’

Incredibly, Mr Hogan then asked the White House to pass on a note to Obama that offered him an open invitation to come down to his bar.

‘I said “if you are out and about swing by Jade Buddha”,’ he joked as he revealed his bar is throwing a secret service themed party this Saturday in honour of the G20.

‘I’m hoping the real ones come along and that there’s not a shoot-out in the room. We’re hoping to get Abbott, Putin and Obama down on the decks and sort out all the world’s problems with me mediating, it will work,’ he laughed.

Previous celebrity visitors to Mr Hogan's bar include Kim Kardashian and Justin Timberlake. 

The couple first met at a friend’s Christmas party when Mr Hogan was dressed in a rather unusual outfit

Mr Hogan said his wife is the most attractive woman in Brisbane, as proved by the fact that when he first opened Jade Buddha with tennis player Pat Rafter (who has now sold his stake in the business) his wife got all the compliments at the event.

‘I kid you not, there were a lot of people at the opening and I lost track of the amount of times people came up to me and said "she is the most attractive woman in the room" and there was some stiff competition with Lara Rafter there. I’m not silly … a happy wife equals a happy life,’ he said.

The father of four, who is partially colour blind and used to shop with a female friend to avoid colour clashes, was forced to go shopping on his own to choose an outfit for the party and he came away with a sparkling silver suit.

It may have been a fashion faux pas but it certainly got his future wife’s attention.

‘It was essentially a silver suit, it almost made Geoff Edelsten look good. I’ll never forget, I looked in the elevator mirror and I was really happy with it and thought “what a wicked suit” and then the doors opened to the party and everyone stared at me.

‘Ten years later when I married Michelle she told me she was going to burn it.’
