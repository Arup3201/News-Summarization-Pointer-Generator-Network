Scientists have revealed a groundbreaking 3D map of Greenland ice sheet allowing them to look back in time.

Using ice-penetrating radar data collected by NASA's Operation IceBridge, the project allows scientists to determine the age of large swaths of the second largest mass of ice on Earth.

They say it could also help predict the future for the sheet, an area containing enough water to raise ocean levels by about 20 feet.

Scientists are studying the ice during different climate periods so they can better predict how the ice sheet will respond in the future.

The CReSIS radar transmits signals into the ice and records the strength and time the reflected signals return. 

They can detect the visible layers in ice that one would read if they were to take an ice core.

 Instead of only being able to measure one area, however, it can measure large swaths of the ice sheet.

CReSIS stands for the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets.

The map gives scientists a better picture of the ice sheet's history.

Scientists can now determine the age of large swaths of the ice sheet and see how the sheet evolved.

Greenland's ice sheet has been losing mass over the past 20 years due to warming temperatures. 

Scientists are studying the ice during different climate periods so they can better predict how the ice sheet will respond in the future.

'This new, huge data volume records how the ice sheet evolved and how it's flowing today,' said Joe MacGregor, the study's lead author, a glaciologist at The University of Texas. 

The ice-penetrating radar, called CReSIS radar, has the ability to detect the visible layers in ice that one would read in ice cores.

The radar transmits signals into the ice and records the strength and time the reflected signals return.

Using this information, researchers were able to determine where the ice surface, sub-ice bedrock, and layers within the ice are.

Ice cores show past snow accumulation and temperatures.

They also contain impurities such as dust and volcanic ash, which would have been carried in by the snow.

The information in ice cores was accumulated and compacted over a period of hundreds of thousands of years.

Prior to using the CReSIS radar, researchers were unable to make maps on such a large scale.

The researchers also used the data collected from Operation IceBridge's aerial missions, which included flights across the ice sheet that covered tens of thousands of kilometers.

Ice Bridge's aerial measurements often intersected areas where researchers already mapped and dated the layers using ice cores.

The core data provided by those sites provided reference points for the radar measurements recently collected.

Scientists are interested learning about the ice from the Eemian period, which was 115,000 to 130,000 years ago, because the temperatures then were about as warm as today's.

The new data provides the first data-based estimate of where ice from that period lies within the sheet.

The ice-penetrating radar, called CReSIS radar, has the ability to detect the visible layers in ice that one would read in ice cores.

Comparing this age volume to simple computer models helped the study's team better understand the ice sheet's history. 

Differences in the mapped and modeled age volumes point to past changes in ice flow or processes such as melting at the ice sheet's base. 

This information will be helpful for evaluating the more sophisticated ice sheet models that are crucial for projecting Greenland's future contribution to sea-level rise.

'Prior to this study, a good ice-sheet model was one that got its present thickness and surface speed right. 

'Now, they'll also be able to work on getting its history right, which is important because ice sheets have very long memories,' said MacGregor.
