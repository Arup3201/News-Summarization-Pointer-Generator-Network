An amateur photographer was shocked when he found what appears to the the ghost of a condemned criminal, complete with a hangman's hood, in a photograph he took in some former prison cells.

Nottingham's Galleries of Justice Museum houses a 15th Century jail, where prisoners were once hanged from the steps. 

And James Pykett, 25, believes he has spotted the spirit of one of those who died there lurking in the shadows.

Eerie: A close-up of the hooded figure

As a CCTV operator, Mr Pykett is used to looking very carefully at images, but when he examined this one, he said: 'It made the hairs on the back of my neck stick up.

'I believed I could see a shadow and when I zoomed in, I was adamant that I could,' he added.

'At first I thought it looked like a guard but then on closer inspection the figure appears to be wearing a hood which condemned prisoners wore when they were hanged.'

Mr Pykett did not spot the 'ghost' when he first took the picture, and only saw it when he was uploading his photos to Facebook.

'This particular photo was uploaded in July, but it wasn't until mid-September when I was messing around with pictures, and doing a bit of picture editing, that I tried enlarging the image, and saw that stuff in the photo,' he said.

'It's almost more spooky that I didn't see the ghost in the photo to start with but that it was there in the background all along.'

Mr Pykett, from Arnold, Nottinghamshire, has always had an interest in ghosts, and photographs historical sites like this one in his spare time. 

'I am interested in the supernatural, and also in the historical side of these sites,' he said.

'It all started back a few years ago when spent a night in the cells at the Galleries of Justice.

'That night made me want to answer more questions about the site because it was just really creepy down there, and I have become fascinated with paranormal stuff since then.'

Fittingly, Mr Pykett is set to marry his fiancée Jodi Wallis, a 23-year-old part-time dog groomer, on Halloween. 

Faye Rollinson, a spokesperson for the Galleries, said: 'Visitors say that when they are walking in the cell area they often have a feeling that they are not alone.

'People say they have seen dark figures there.'

David Cross, who runs the Nottingham Ghost Walk, said: 'Nottingham is one of the most haunted places in England due to historic happenings, including the Norman Invasion.'

Several ghosts are said to frequent the area around Robin Hood's statue and Lace Market, he added.
