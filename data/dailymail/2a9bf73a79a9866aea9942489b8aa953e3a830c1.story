The body of Tony Benn will rest overnight in Parliament’s chapel before his funeral – an honour only previously given to Baroness Thatcher.

The veteran Labour MP will be given the controversial tribute because he had the ‘almost unique distinction’ of the freedom of the House.

The Queen gave permission for the move yesterday after it was suggested by Speaker John Bercow to the Benn family, who said they were ‘deeply touched’.

Former cabinet minister and campaigner Mr Benn, who died last week aged 88, will now lie in the chapel of St Mary Undercroft on Wednesday night so MPs, peers and parliamentary staff can pay their respects.

However, the move has attracted criticism from both Labour and Conservative MPs who last night said the achievements of Mr Benn and Lady Thatcher were ‘not comparable’.

Tory MP Rob Wilson, an aide to the Chancellor, said: ‘This is an error of judgment from the Speaker. Margaret Thatcher was Britain’s first female prime minister, she came from an  ordinary background to hold that office and dominate British politics for over a decade. 

‘Even her fiercest opponents do not dispute that she made a huge impact. By contrast, Tony Benn was the son of a hereditary peer whose politics and views were not just rejected by the public but by his own party over two decades before he left Parliament.

‘The achievement and significance of the two are hardly comparable. Longevity doesn’t equal significance and sentimental gestures such as this risk demeaning and degrading parliament and its traditions.’ 

One Labour MP said there was ‘unease’ among some in the party at the decision, saying: ‘You don’t wish to speak ill of the dead, but clearly there is no equivalence with Mrs Thatcher – she won three general elections.’ 

Another Labour MP said: ‘He never held a great office of state and he almost destroyed the Labour Party.’ 

Former Conservative party chairman Lord Tebbit said it ‘made parliament look rather silly’ given Mr Benn’s antipathy to the House of Lords. He renounced his hereditary peerage to remain as an MP.

The peer added: ‘I’m at a loss to know why it’s thought he should be accorded this honour, rather than many who have achieved far more. 

‘One can think of people like Alec Douglas-Home, as an obvious example, not to mention Earl Attlee. After all, Benn was an opponent of one of the components of parliament, the House of Lords. It seems quite extraordinary.’ 

Mr Benn became an MP in 1950, and won 16 elections, serving in the cabinets of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 70s.

During the political battles of the 1980s, he ran unsuccessfully for the deputy leadership of the party, and was seen as the voice of the hard Left.

After standing down as MP in 2001, he became an influential campaigner against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

One of his four children is Hilary Benn, 60, a Labour MP in the shadow cabinet. The Speaker’s office yesterday said the decision to let his body rest overnight recognised his more than 50 years as an MP. 

After Edward Heath, he is one of only two MPs to be awarded the freedom of the House in honour of his ‘very long and distinguished service’.

‘It is this almost unique distinction which forms the basis for Tony Benn to be accorded the privilege to ‘rest’ in the Chapel on the eve of his funeral,’ said  a spokesman. 

The Queen’s permission was sought by The House of Lords official Black Rod because the chapel is part of the royal estate.Both Ed Miliband and David Cameron paid tribute to Mr Benn’s achievements at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday. 

The Prime Minister said: ‘He was a magnificent writer, speaker, diarist and campaigner, with a strong record of public and political service.’

A spokesman for the Benn  family said: ‘The family were deeply touched by the Speaker’s suggestion and would like to thank all those who have made it possible for their father to spend his last night in Parliament.’ 

The funeral will take place at St Margaret’s Church, between Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament.

It will not be a ceremonial affair like Lady Thatcher’s but a number of  public tickets will be available. 

The Speaker’s chaplain, the Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, has agreed to keep a vigil beside the body through the night.

Lady Thatcher’s coffin was placed in the chapel following her death in line with her wishes.

The site is alongside Westminster Hall, a location for state funerals, and a short service took place before her funeral last year.
