Distraught: Liz Lowther, pictured, said she was reduced to tears by the string of threatening letters from Virgin Media to her late husband, James

A widow was left so distraught by threatening letters sent by Virgin Media to her late husband that she wrote to company founder Richard Branson.

Liz Lowther said that she wrote to the company after her husband's death last March, explaining that she was handling his affairs and asking them to transfer the account into her name.

But she was reduced to tears after Virgin Media continued to send notices addressed to James.

Mrs Lowther, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said Virgin had sent a number of letters requesting that she return a 'multi-media hub' - used to connect to the internet - and warned that she faced a £150 bill if she failed to do so.  

The 70-year-old said that her problems began after she wrote the the company following her husband's death.

'I have had numerous letters still addressed to James,' she said. 'To lose my beloved husband was terrible. But it's been made much worse by Virgin repeatedly sending letters to me in his name.'

'That's despite me sending them at least 12 letters and making around the same number of phone calls. Virgin Media have shown a complete lack of compassion.'

She said that she grew so desperate that she even wrote to Richard Branson, but had received to response.

'He's probably just sitting on his island,' she said. 'Maybe Richard Branson should spend less time staring at the stars and more time dealing with customers here on earth.' 

In December, she wrote again to the company to give notice that she no longer wished to stayed with them because of their behaviour. 

But on Saturday, another letter addressed to her husband arrived, requesting the hub. 

Mrs Lowther said: 'I am 70 and my friends are horrified at what has happened since my dear husband passed away. I am still waiting for a written apology.

'I am not asking for compensation as I don't need it but it would be nice to get some sort of recognition from Virgin as they have caused me such distress.

'Lots of my friends have told me they have experienced something similar with Virgin customer service.'

She added that she had been reduced to tears by the company's 'insensitive attitude', saying that is could have 'destroyed' an older woman.

Out of touch: Mrs Lowther said she had written to Richard Branson, but had not received a response. She said 'he is probably just sitting on his island', referring to Necker Island (pictured), his private escape

was shocked at the firm's 'insensitive attitude' and said that an apology had not been sent. 

Mrs Lowther said other companies reacted in a more thoughtful manner when she informed them of her husband's death.  

'When I went to cancel my husband's Barclaycard they not only did it straight away but sent me a lovely letter and some flowers,' she said. 'And Sky have been good in their dealings with me so far.

'But I have had to deal with the stress of Virgin writing letters to my dead husband for nearly a year now - I am disgusted by it.' 

A Virgin Media spokesman said they have now contacted Liz to tell her she does not need to return the hub.

He said: 'As she is now with another provider, we've closed the account and ensured there are no outstanding charges.

'We've spoken to Mrs Lowther and she is reassured we've done all we can.'
