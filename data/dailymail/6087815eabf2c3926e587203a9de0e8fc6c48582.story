She has been a regular on the London social scene of late and it seems that rubbing shoulders with the great and the gorgeous has made sure Princess Beatrice has no fear about being star struck.

The Princess, 25, enjoyed a night out last night with boyfriend Dave Clark at famous Mayfair restaurant Nobu.

A notorious celebrity hangout, the young royal was at Nobu at the same time as singer Ronan Keating and friends but confident Beatrice seemed unfazed by the media attention, smiling for the waiting press as she exited the restaurant.

The pair appeared to have enjoyed their time at the famous sushi restaurant, which is often frequented by celebrities

Beatrice wore an all black outfit but carried a bright emerald green tote

Having grown up at the height of Boyzone mania she might have been forgiven for swooning at the sight of one of the band members but cool and collected Beatrice showed no signs of adoration at having shared the room with a former member of the band.

Shadowed by Virgin Galactic businessman David as she left Nobu, the couple seemed to have enjoyed their dinner at the pricey sushi eatery, where diners can feast on such dishes as salmon tartar with caviar and roast whitefish with truffles, as well a generous helping of celebrity spotting.

The red headed princess was dressed in a chic all black ensemble including a black leather jacket, a black blouse and short flowing black skirt.

With only sheer black tights to protect her from the rather chilly temperatures Beatrice wore a pair of on-trend low-heeled black ankle boots for her night out.

Also at Nobu last night was Ronan Keating, with girlfriend Australian television producer Storm Uechtritz

The young royal didn't forget to accessorise and added a stylish pop of colour to her sophisticated look with an emerald green patterned handbag. 

As part of a spate of public appearances The Princess of York also attended the Creative London Party on Monday night, where she rubbed sartorial shoulders with big names across film, fashion and music at the glamorous Spencer House.

She also joined fellow royal the Duchess of Cambridge last night at black-tie gala 2014 and The National Portrait Gallery last week and demonstrated a confidence and style she's becoming known for.

 Beatrice is normally a fan of an all-black colour palette but branched out at the Creative London party

On Monday she deviated from her usual dark colour palette, arriving in a bright floral skirt with a white blouse tucked in, metallic strappy courts and a purple clutch bag.

She is currently completing an internship in the television department of Sony Entertainment in London, and is clearly taking advantage of the opportunity to be out and about in the capital.

Beatrice left her job at an investment capital firm last summer and used the interim period to travel with long term boyfriend Dave Clark and continue her royal charity work.
