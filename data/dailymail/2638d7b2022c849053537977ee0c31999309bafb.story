Despite offering customers a 10 per cent store-wide discount at the weekend in an attempt to regain some of the loyalty lost during their data breach scandal, new survey results show Target is still struggling to weather what is being called its worst crisis in their 50-year history.

Considered the nation's No. 2 retailer, Target has reached its lowest consumer perception point since at least 2007, according to polling site YouGov, dropping a whopping 45 points in brand popularity.

The day after Target announced that hackers had somehow accessed information to an estimated 40 million customer credit and debit cards on December 20, it's 'Buzz Score' on YouGov dropped 35 points to -9.

Then on Monday, the day after CEO Gregg Steinhafel’s 10 per cent off offer ended, Target fell even further to - 19.

In one day, from last Thursday December 19 through Friday December 20, Target's consumer perception dropped further than either PlayStation or Citibank did in one week after their recent data breaches became public, according to YouGov. The total point drop is 45

Empty: Target is struggling to regain its customers and reputation after an estimated 40 million people were affected by their card-hacking scandal from November 27 to the first week of December. The data breach was made public December 20

Since the hacking crisis, Target has launched an aggressive public relations campaign to show how seriously they are handling the situation, including offering customers a 10 per cent discount last weekend

Leading up to the scandal announcement, Target's Buzz Score was 26.

Their total point drop in the aftermath was 45.

The lowest Buzz score Target has ever received was around 10 in 2007.

The Justice Department is still investigating the credit hack, which is being called the second largest incident of its in U.S. history.

The largest affected at least 47.5 million T.J. Maxx customers in the mid-2000s.

The lack of answers around the Target data breach is the likely cause of the store's customer alienation.

In order to ascertain a company's 'Buzz Score', YouGov surveys customers asking whether they have 'heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth, that was positive or negative'.

At least 15,000 people have been interview regarding Target since July 1, YouGov said.

Target says that all members of staff are working to help resolve the date breach issue, however survey results say they have been dealt a major blow in brand popularity

As the chart shows, shoppers’ perception of Target dropped well below that of similar brands like Walmart, Kmart and Macy’s just before the last weekend of the holiday shopping season - a critical time for retailers.

Customers affected by the Target breach complained that they had to cancel credit and debit cards just as they were rushing to buy holiday gifts.

Millions of others faced bank-imposed limits on how much cash they could take out at ATMs or spend on their debit cards.

It will take several weeks, at minimum, for Target to recover their reputation.

In June 2011, it took four weeks for Citibank to bounce back in their following a data breach.

Similarly in April 2011, PlayStation took six to eight weeks after their own credit hack.

Target, which is based in Minneapolis, has spent the last week executing a fierce public relations counterattack designed to show how aggressively they are handling the crisis.

Economists estimate Target's sales on Saturday, the crucial retail weekend before Christmas, were down 3 per cent compared with the same day last year

'Thousands of Target team members, including our most senior leaders, have been working around the clock to help make this right for our guests,' Target’s online newsletter said.

'From call centers to our financial services team to technology teams throughout the company, we will not rest until every guests need is met.'

Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners consulting firm in Connecticut, estimates that traffic at Target stores on Saturday fell 3 percent compared with the same day a year ago, while other retailers saw growth.

'The credit card theft was the single biggest factor in the decline,' Johnson said.

'The company did not do a premiere job in handling this crisis.
