A woman is suing her gynecologist after he mistakenly sprayed her private parts with a dangerous chemical typically used to clean drains.

Laura, who doesn’t want her last name revealed, claims she has been left in terrible pain and can’t have further children following the harrowing experience.

The incident occurred when she visited her doctor's office at Paragon Health in Summit County, Ohio, to undergo a supposedly routine gynecological exam, known as a colposcopy.

It is not uncommon for a doctor to use vinegar when examining a woman's private parts, but the liquid sprayed on Laura caused her to feel extreme pain and a burning sensation in her vaginal canal, cervix and surrounding area.

‘It was like an open cut with rubbing alcohol being poured into it,’ she told WKYC.

Instead of vinegar, the solution contained potassium hydroxide, a chemical typically used to unclog drains and pipes.

‘It soaks in and continues to soak in and burns from the inside out. It's not meant to go inside anyone's body,’ said Laura’s husband Paul.

The couple were hoping to have more children, but now Laura believes she will need a hysterectomy

Since his wife’s ordeal, her husband has taken to demonstrating outside Paragon's offices with signs alleging that they permanently injured his wife.

The couple’s lawsuit names Paragon Health associate Dr. John Black and other unnamed employees as defendants.

According to the lawsuit, Black suspected something went wrong and attempted to irrigate the burn area with three bottles of saline solution, while also applying a cream to numb the pain.

Unfortunately, Black allegedly wasn’t wearing gloves. ‘He puts an ungloved dirty finger inside her and rubs a numbing cream inside her. It's disgusting,’ said Paul.

Laura says the doctor told her: 'I hope you're not offended. I just want to let you know I've been married forever, and I don't have any diseases.'

Afterward, when she went to the emergency room at Akron General Hospital, doctors found a plastic bottle cap behind Laura’s cervix.

Further, when the hospital called to determine the pH level of the liquid, Paragon claimed it was 7.5, basically harmless, though the hospital later discovered it was 12 or higher.

But in Paragon's response to the malpractice lawsuit, Black maintains that he used a vinegar solution on Laura. Paragon has denied virtually all other allegations in the lawsuit.

According to Laura her injuries have prevented her from having intimate relations with her husband.

She said she experiences ongoing, irregular bleeding, and she can't enjoy simple pleasures like swimming with her two children.

She and her husband were hoping to have more children, but now believe she will need a hysterectomy. ‘This a scenario that no woman would ever, ever imagine,’ she said.
