Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden claims in a new interview that the U.S. agency is involved in industrial espionage.

German public television broadcaster ARD released a written statement before an interview airing Sunday night in which it quotes Snowden as saying that if German engineering company Siemens had information that would benefit the United States - but had nothing to do with national security needs - the National Security Agency would still use it.

'If there's information at Siemens that's beneficial to US national interests – even if it doesn't have anything to do with national security – then they'll take that information nevertheless,' Snowden said, according to ARD, which interviewed Snowden in Moscow, where he has claimed asylum.

ARD did not give any further context and it was not clear what exactly Snowden accused the NSA of doing with such information.

The latest charges made against the NSA by Snowden come less than two weeks after it was revealed that the NSAhas implanted software in nearly 100,000 computers around the 
world - but not in the United States - that allows the U.S. to conduct 
surveillance on those machines, The New York Times reported earlier this month.

The
 Times cited NSA documents, computer experts and U.S. officials in its 
report about the use of secret technology using radio waves to gain 
access to computers that other countries have tried to protect from 
spying or cyberattacks.

The agency has planted most of the software through getting access to computer networks, but has also used a secret technology that allows it entry even to computers not connected to the Internet, the Times said, citing U.S. officials, computer experts and documents leaked by Snowden.

The software network could also create a digital
 highway for launching cyberattacks.

The agency claims that of the 100,000 computers it has tapped, none of them are in the United States

The
 Times reported that the technology, used by the agency for several 
years, relies on radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit 
boards and USB cards inserted covertly into the computers. The NSA calls
 the effort an "active defense" and has used the technology to monitor 
units of the Chinese Army, the Russian military, drug cartels, trade 
institutions inside the European Union, and sometime U.S. partners 
against terrorism like Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan, the Times 
reported.

Among the most frequent targets of 
the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, the Times reported, has been the Chinese
 Army. The United States has accused the Chinese Army of launching 
regular attacks on American industrial and military targets, often to 
steal secrets or intellectual property. When Chinese attackers have 
placed similar software on computer systems of American companies or 
government agencies, American officials have protested, the newspaper 
reported.

The NSA says the technology has not been used in computers in the U.S.

'NSA's
 activities are focused and specifically deployed against - and only 
against - valid foreign intelligence targets in response to intelligence
 requirements,' Vanee Vines, an agency spokeswoman, said in a statement 
to the Times. 'We do not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal 
the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of - or give 
intelligence we collect to - U.S. companies to enhance their 
international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.'

Leaked: Parts of the program have been disclosed in documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden

Parts
 of the program have been disclosed in documents leaked by Edward 
Snowden, the former NSA systems analyst, the Times reported. A Dutch 
newspaper published the map showing where the United States has inserted
 spy software, sometimes with the help of local authorities. Der 
Spiegel, a German newsmagazine, published information about the NSA's 
hardware products that can secretly transmit and receive signals from 
computers, according to the Times.

The Times 
said that it withheld some of those details, at the request of U.S. 
intelligence officials, when it reported in summer 2012 on American 
cyberattacks on Iran.
