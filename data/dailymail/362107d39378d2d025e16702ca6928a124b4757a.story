A mother-of-two has come up with a creative way to inspire her sons to eat their vegetables by turning their lunchbox napkins into amazing works of art.

Nina Levy, 45, draws her sons' heroes from movies and video games onto their napkins - and has not missed a single lunch for seven years.

Ms Levy, from Brooklyn, New York, pictures all of her children's favourites, from Batman to Puss in Boots and Angry Birds, and is often put to the test by her sons with some very imaginative results.

Wild imagination: One of her son's requested a napkin with Connor from Assassins Creed playing dodge ball with Spiderman and Robin - and Nina complied

Archer, ten, and his six-year-old 
brother Ansel's requests have resulted in everything from a dodge ball 
match between Spiderman and Robin to the Hulk head-locking a 
Tyrannosaurs Rex and a pack of 'Superdogs'.

Using a simple marker pen and the occasional stroke of a brush, Ms Levy spends hours creating her unique napkin designs.

She added: ‘I started drawing the napkins in 2006, and strangely have not missed a school or camp day since,' Nina explains.

'My son's usually tell me what they want to see on their napkins.'

'They often come up with quite specific 
and elaborate requests and multiple characters engaged in complicated 
activities are not uncommon.'

Ms
Levy says has lost count of just how many unique napkins she has 
created but estimates it's now around the 2,000 mark as she often draws 
late into the night.

The incredible collection has stirred 
up some napkin envy from other parents as fans from her daily napkin 
blog site have labelled her the 'Coolest Mom Ever' and 'Overachieving 
Mom of the Year'.

Nina, who is also a photographer, uses a mixture of 'Sharpie' marker pens and occasional water colours to illustrate her napkins.

She said ‘There's an eventual end to this endeavour, But for now, at the end of the day, it just keeps me up to date with what they're interested in.

‘We're all having a lot of fun with it.’
