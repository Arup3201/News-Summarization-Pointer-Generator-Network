Perhaps it is only fitting that the farewell to the greatest links golfer of all time is proving something of a long goodbye.

Tom Watson was first waved off at St Andrews in 2010, only for the Royal and Ancient Golf Club to recognise his stunning achievement in coming within a shot of victory in 2009 at the age of 59, and grant him five more years.

This interview was arranged to recognise the closing of that window and Watson taking his leave at Royal Liverpool this week. Now the R&A have moved the goalposts once more and it will be back to the Old Course where the final, final hurrah will take place next year.

And who has any complaints about the great man taking more curtain calls than Sinatra?

Let Michael Watson speak for all of us. When his dad phoned him with the news, he settled for a one word answer: ‘Awesome.’

This is a particularly apt moment to converse, of course, since this is when Watson’s worlds collide.

Before playing Hoylake for the first time on Saturday, he has been at Gleneagles in his role as America’s Ryder Cup captain, spending time with a few of his prospective team members on a reconnaissance mission before the match in September.

And so the conversation zips back and forth, between The Open and the Ryder Cup.

My favourite moment

At the opening ceremony at Lytham in 1977, listening to the speeches and watching the American flag go up. I had never played in an international team event before and that was a big moment in my life.

My favourite match

Winning the Ryder Cup at The Belfry in 1993 as captain was very satisfying. The Europeans were on a roll, they had a great team, but we just did nearly everything right that week to come out on top.

My biggest disappointment

It might be Medinah last time, just watching it on TV. I suffered through that. When I lost The Open in 2009 I had a pit in my stomach for 24 hours. After Medinah, it lasted several days.

When we talk about The Open, we get the graciousness that has been the hallmark of his time in the event, right back to his first appearance at Carnoustie in 1975. He has missed only three Opens in the four decades since.

And when we talk about the Ryder Cup, we see the hardened inner core of a man strong enough to win it on five occasions (only the Englishman Harry Vardon won it more).

Watson thinks Jim Furyk, sixth in the standings, has done enough to finish in the top nine who qualify automatically — the cut-off point is the US PGA Championship next month — and so it was only natural to ask the captain, who has a  psychology degree from Stanford University, whether he will need a quiet word with the player who was one of the fall guys on that dramatic final day at Medinah in 2012.

‘No,’ said Watson.

What, no concerns for him at all?

‘No,’ he repeated, in a tone that emphasised this was going to be his one and only word on the subject.

Neither were there any revealing answers regarding Ian Poulter, the fist-pumping inspiration for Europe’s record comeback. Do you think, Tom, he will have a target on his back after last time?

‘He’s got a tremendous Cup record, but whoever plays for Europe will have a target on their back given that if we beat them, we gain a point,’ he said.

So beating Poulter would not mean anything more — he is just one of a team of 12.

Is that what you’re  saying? ‘Those are your words, not mine,’ commented Watson.

After the steely eye it was time for rheumy reminiscence.

Back to the Claret Jug, then. Did you know the man whom the R&A are desperate to keep at The Open was not allowed anywhere near the first tee on his first day in 1975?

‘I was with John Mahaffey and Hubert Green and Keith McKenzie (then secretary of the R&A)  welcomed us, but he said we weren’t allowed to play Carnoustie. He said it was reserved for qualifiers, that exempt players weren’t allowed to play it. One thing led to another and we ended up at Monifieth.’

Watson had the last laugh.

His first visit to The Open, and he ended all such mutterings about him being a choker by winning his first Jug after a play-off against Australian Jack Newton.

My favourite moment

I'd
 have to choose 1977 at Turnberry and the Duel in the Sun against Jack 
Nicklaus. How often do you get to play 36 holes against the greatest 
player of all time and come out on top?

My favourite round

It
 was my first round at Muirfield in 1980. The wind was blowing 30mph, it
 was about 50 degrees and raining sideways. And me and Lee Trevino shot 
68. That was great.

My biggest disappointment

I
 had chances to win several more Opens but I'd have to say 1994 at 
Turnberry hurt the most. I was playing so well that week and just 
couldn't putt. That one hurt for quite a while.

So it began, the Watson era, and while there were glorious victories at Muirfield (1980), Troon (1982) and Birkdale (1983) it would be his time at Turnberry that would prove definitive.

‘Three of the most memorable highlights were at Turnberry. One was a victory and two were disappointments,’ he said. ‘Duelling down the stretch with Jack Nicklaus in 1977 would have to be my finest moment but 1994 was the most  disappointed I’ve ever felt leaving a golf course.

‘Some might talk about losing to Seve at St Andrews in 1984 and yes, it would have been wonderful to win The Open at the Home of Golf. But in 1994 I was playing so well and yet I couldn’t do a thing with the putter. I put it round the hole for four days but I couldn’t make it count.

‘Then in 2009, that was such a marvellous experience up until the final moments. I had a pit in my stomach for a day afterwards but the disappointment was buffered  by the fact it was a bonus to be in  contention at that stage of my life, and the fact I had won five Opens.

‘But do you know the one thing that never grows old? It’s that lovely feeling of anxiety and nervousness on the first tee. I still get it now.’

Talking to Watson about The Open recalls that wonderful Bobby Jones line: ‘I could take out of my life  everything except my experiences at St Andrews, and I would still have had a rich, full life.’  

Does he feel the same way? ‘Bob put it beautifully and eloquently, didn’t he?’ said Watson. ‘Yes I do. That’s why it means so much to me to be able to finish at St Andrews.

‘When you think of the great courses of the world you think of two in particular — Pebble Beach and St Andrews. I was lucky enough to finish at the US Open at Pebble Beach with my son on the bag and did all right (he finished in the top 30 in 2010). Now we get the chance to do the same at St Andrews.’

And so the long goodbye continues at Royal Liverpool, where Watson will have one eye on his own play and one on those who can make his team. There are basically only three more chances for Americans to force their way into the US side through automatic qualifying and this week is one of them.

‘What am I looking for during these last few events? Someone to reach out and demand a place with their play,’ said Watson. ‘It’s like in football, you get to the last seconds and there’s a player who says:  “Give me the ball, coach. I’ll get you the score you need.” I want players who can make that putt and win a tournament.’

What about the man he has spent most of his time answering  questions about — Tiger Woods?

‘First, it’s great to see him back and I assume he’s healthy if he’s playing at Hoylake,’ he said. ‘I’ve said all along I’ll pick him if he’s healthy and playing well.

‘My only concern is the FedEx Cup play-offs. If he doesn’t make those, that would mean he’s missing a month of competitive golf before the Ryder Cup — having missed such a big chunk already. If that happened, I’d have a decision to make.’

As for his own game, do not be surprised if Watson makes it through to the weekend. He did it at a PGA Tour event two weeks ago where, remarkably at the age of 64, he broke 70 in three of his four rounds.

The swing might not be quite as full and the putting stroke remains shaky, as it has for the past 20 years. But he can still play.

Regardless, of course, the spectators in the first wraparound stand in Open history at Hoylake’s 18th hole will rise to recognise his contribution to the game’s showpiece. It is, quite simply, beyond compare.
