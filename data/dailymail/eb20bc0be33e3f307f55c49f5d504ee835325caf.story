An Australian airline worker returned to his car following six weeks abroad only to discover a nest on the rear windscreen wiper . . .with a brooding bird sitting on eggs.

Trevor Maltby, arrived at Cairns International Airport following a trip to Papua New Guinea.

He went to the staff car park to pick up his vehicle and found a female Peaceful Dove perilously perched on the back of his Audi Hatchback - incubating her eggs.Â 

The female Peaceful Dove was found nesting her eggs on the back windscreen wipers of Mr Maltby's car

Maltby said in an interview with Yahoo: 
'At first I thought it was just trying to "blend in," then I noticed it 
looked like it was trying to make a nest.

'As I got closer it appeared it
was not about to fly away. My colleague put his hand right up to it's 
face, and that's when it raised its wings and exposed those eggs.'

After spending an hour on the phone with wildlife experts, Trevor took up the offer from a colleague of a ride home and offered to leave, both, his car and the the nest alone for the few weeks it was hoped it would take for the eggs to hatch.

The eggs were moved but the mother could not be found. Experts say that she is likely to produce more eggs very soon

He added: 'The next day I got a call 
from the airport to say that the wildlife officials had come and removed
the nest as its location was deemed to be far from ideal, and that I 
could come and collect my car.

'The eggs have been taken to an 
incubator and the mother was unable to be caught and taken with them, 
though they figured she would probably lay again in the very near 
future.'

The nesting mother used Christmas ribbon to create her nest on a traffic light

Just last month baffled motorists in Leicester found a bird incubating eggs on an amber traffic light.

The bird, which was either a mistle or song thrush, had even used some Christmas wrapping to make its nest.

The light may seem an unusual place to nest, but its warmth provides heat for the eggs

Photographer Jason Senior, 40, from Leicester said: 'There were a lot of people standing around looking at this bird, I suppose it thought it had the green light to start nesting so early.

'If you look closely you can see ribbon from what might be Christmas wrapping in with the twigs in the nest

'I was there for about half an hour and the bird seemed pretty happy and oblivious to all the commotion around it.'

Gemma Hogg from thr RSPB said: 'Birds make their nests in all sorts of unusual places, and this isn't the first traffic light nest we've seen - in the past we've had birds nesting in, bins, hanging baskets and even an ash tray outside a pub.'It may seem odd to us, but it's actually quite common. They see a safe, secure and cosy spot to lay eggs and raise chicks and don't care what it looks like or what the neighbours might think.

'The RSPB recommends putting out high energy foods in gardens to help your birds get through the winter. A supply of unfrozen, fresh water is also really important.'
