Jourdan Dunn, no shrinking violet, has spoken out about racism in the industry to Miss Vogue.

The mother of one, to four-year-old Riley, was the first black model to walk a Prada runway in over a decade in 2008.

She has recently discussed being turned away from a casting because they 'didn't want any more black girls', and having a white make-up artist refuse to do her make-up.

'I don't know why people applaud designers for having just one ethnic model. It's not like only one type of woman loves fashion,' she tells Miss Vogue, which comes with the April issue of Vogue on sale today.

'I find it weird when [model] agents say, 'You're the only black girl booked for the show. Isn't it great?' Why is it great?'

The comments come six months after Dunn backed Iman and Naomi Campbell's campaign for racial diversity on the catwalk.

'I want to talk about what goes on. A lot of people are scared to speak up,' she said at the time.

Shop until 10pm from March 13 on www.thelabel.co.uk and receive your order the very next day with no extra charge.
