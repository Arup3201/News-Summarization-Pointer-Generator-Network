A gadget fan spent two weeks wearing Google Glass almost non-stop and says the groundbreaking new device has changed his life so significantly he never wants to go a day without them again.

Tech blogger Robert Scoble is one of the few people to experience the spectacle-style device which projects a mini-display directly in front of the user's eye and features a phone, camera, Internet connection and GPS.

Scoble has written a comprehensive review of Google Glass, praising the way it responds instantly to voice commands and allows users to capture moments on the camera in a fraction of a second.

A step too far? Mr Scoble even posted a picture of himself wearing Glass in the shower

Scoble's blog, Scobleizer, earned national attention while he worked as a 'technology evangelist' for Microsoft. 

Since then, he has authored pieces for a number of national publications and is considered an important voice in emerging tech.

Since getting Google Glass, Scoble 
said he had given five speeches while wearing the product as well as 
going through airports and letting hundreds of people try them out.

'This has changed my life,' he wrote on Google+. 'I will never live a day without it on.'

Scoble praised the device as being far more social than a cell phone, for having excellent voice command software, and for a camera that 'totally changes photography' by allowing you to capture moments in a fraction of a second.

He said the voice commands are tailored to such specific commands that 'accuracy' is 'crazy high, even if you have an accent.'

While he praised it as revolutionizing his life, he added that the model's success 'totally depends on price.'

Impressed: Scoble wrote that he never wanted to go a day without Google Glass again

Eye spy: Robert Scoble said he believes the success of the device depends on price

Scoble said that if the model was priced too high - say in the $500 range - not enough people would adopt it. But at a range of roughly $200 Google could pull in enough users that it would vastly grow Google's social network, Google+. 

The right price point could signal a revolution in Google's business model.

'Also,
 Google is forbidding advertising in apps,' he wrote. 'This is a HUGE shift for 
Google's business model. I believe Larry Page is moving Google from an 
advertising-based company to a commerce based company.'

For example, Scoble wrote about finding a restaurant.

Google Glass could change the way Google makes its revenue assuming the company moves away from an advertising-based model

Scoble wrote privacy issues were not a concern, and that almost no one asked him to take Google Glass off while talking to them

'The first 
thing I tried that it failed on was 'find me a Sushi restaurant.' I'm 
sure that will get fixed soon and, Google could collect a micropayment 
anytime I complete a transaction like reserving a seat at a restaurant, 
or getting a book delivered to my house, or, telling something like 
Bloomingdales 'get me these jeans,' he wrote.

'There is literally billions 
of dollars to be made with this new commerce-based system, rather than 
force us to sit and look at ads, the way Facebook and tons of other 
services do.'

He also dismissed privacy concerns, writing that while in Germany only one person asked him to take them off while they spoke.

'I've been 
telling people that this reminds me of the Apple II, which I unboxed 
with my dad back in 1977,' he wrote. 'It was expensive. It didn't do much. But I 
knew my life had changed in a big way and would just get better and 
better. Already this week I've gotten a new RSS app, the New York Times 
App, and a Twitter app. With many more on the way.'
