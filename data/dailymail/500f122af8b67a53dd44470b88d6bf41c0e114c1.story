A taxi driver was left gasping for air for 14 hours after his car crashed off the road and overturned, leaving him trapped in a ditch filled with water.

Mark Beckford described himself as 'lucky to be alive' and was just 10 minutes from death when he was finally pulled from his red MG ZR by rescuers following his terrifying ordeal.

The 44-year-old, who had careered off the road in the early hours of the morning after being startled by a fox, scrambled into the back of his taxi where he had found a life-saving air-pocket.

Reliving his horrifying experience, Mr Beckford said: 'I noticed two cars coming 
towards me. I didn’t think anything of it but then I saw this fox in the
middle of the road, just staring at me.

'It startled me, so I jolted. The next thing I know the car was spinning.

'I don’t know what happened next - I couldn’t tell you if my car went into the ditch front first or backwards.

'It was all so quick. I don’t remember hitting the water. I do know that the other cars didn’t stop, though.

'I swallowed a lot of water and it was pitch black. I got into the back seat of the car and found a small air pocket.

'I had no idea how long I was in the car, I couldn’t see any daylight as the car was under water.

'All
I had to keep me alive was a small air pocket. I was really scared. I 
was struggling to breathe and I was panicking. All I could do was wait.

'I
could hear cars driving past and I shouted. I grabbed something from 
inside the car and banged the top of the car. Obviously, no one could 
hear me.'

Mr Beckford ordeal began when he came off the A2070 near Hamstreet in Kent at 2am on August 13.

When he failed to return home, his panicked wife Lesley, 60, rang round trying to find him, and eventually reported him missing to police at 12.30pm.

He was only saved when lorry driver Mike Scott, 30, spotted the car's back wheel poking out of the water at 3.20pm.

Mr Scott, from Swanley in Kent, said: 'I just saw something in the ditch out of the corner of my eye.

'It
could have been anything. I pulled over and called the police. They 
asked me to stay on the line and go and have a closer look.

He added: 'I
watched the crews go down into the water. At first I didn’t know anyone
was in there, but once we knew I wanted to stay to see if they were 
okay.'

Mr Beckford, who 
suffered hypothermia and internal bruising, paid tribute to the man who saved his life, saying: 'Mike is a God-send. 
If he hadn’t called the police when he did, I would have died. He saved 
my life.

“I wasn’t 
really with it when I was pulled out of the car. I was under by then 
though, my body had shut down. They said another 10 minutes and I would 
have died.'

Mr Beckford was hospitalised for 10 days following the incident, and has only now been able to speak.

The two men have spoken since the crash and plan to meet up soon.
