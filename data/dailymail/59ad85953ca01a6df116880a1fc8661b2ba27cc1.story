The three suspects in a bank robbery gone wrong who used a married mother as a human shield during a high-speed chase and gun battle with police are believed to be part of a notorious street gang, authorities said.

Misty Holt-Singh was one of three women - another customer and a bank employee - taken hostage and used as human shields during shootout that saw 20 officers fire shots and three of the getaway SUV's six occupants including her die.

A 19-year-old gang-banger was taken alive by police and two of the hostages pushed from the moving vehicle after being shot are miraculously expected to survive their injuries, authorities said.

2 P.M. - Three armed men enter a Bank of the West branch in Hammer Lane and Thornton Road 
in north Stockton, Cali.

2:11 p.m. - A bank guard alerts police before being restrained

2:12 p.m. - Police arrive on the scene

2:16 p.m. - The thieves make off with three hostages in a bank employees green SUV. They make it 14 blocks before shooting one.

2:28 p.m. - The thieves pull off the highway in an attempt to ambush pursuing officers but are foiled when authorities spot them

3:16 p.m. - They shoot the second hostage

3:18 p.m. - Police are able to shoot out the SUV's tires bringing it to a halt in the middle of an intersection

3:20 - The thieves exit the SUV using hostage Misty Holt-Singh as a human shield. She's killed in the crossfire along with two of the thieves.

The robbers are believed by officials to be members of the violent Norteno street gang, Stockton Police CHief Eric Jones said during a Thursday press briefing.

Police arrived on the scene in less than a minute after the robbers took the three female hostages
 from the building at gunpoint, before stealing one of their SUVs and speeding away.

Holt-SIngh's 12-year-old daughter was left left stranded at the bank as her mother was taken hostage and was fortunately unharmed - but now is without a mother, according to CBS Sacramento.

Reports have suggested Holt-Sing may have been killed by police fire, and Jones was unable to confirm during the Thursday press briefing whose gunfire killed the woman, according to the Los Angeles Times.

A MailOnline message left late Thursday night with Stockton Police seeking further information was not immediately returned.

The other two hostages had far different outcomes.

The thieves only went 14 blocks before shooting one of the hostages who was then either pushed from the truck or jumped. Doctors say her injuries are not life threatening.

For the next 45 minutes, the robbers 
led dozens of police cars on a chase across highways and city streets, 
according to Stockton police Officer Joe Silva.

The robbers not only had assault rifles but extra magazines taped or strapped to their bodies. The gunfire was unrelenting, police said. Officers had no choice but to engage the suspects.

Police lost the SUV at approximately 2:28 p.m. as it pulled off the highway. However, rather than using the advantage to speed away the thieves stopped in position to ambush the police they knew were just seconds away.

Luckily for authorities, another officer saw them from another angle and warned the pursuing officers.

14 police cars were shot during the pursuit before the SUV's tires could be shot out

A second hostage was shot at 3:16 
p.m., shortly before she either jumped from the car or was pushed. She 
is expected to survive, according to the Times.

Police were able to shoot out the SUV's tires two minutes later and bring it to a halt in the middle of an intersection.

They used Holt-Singh, their final hostage, as a human shield in a final shootout. She was tragically killed in the crossfire.

'These
 suspects wanted no part of a peaceful resolution,' said Jones. 

'It was such a chaotic ... fluid 
situation, really one of the most dangerous, tense situations that a 
police officer could go through,' he continued.

'The firing never stopped. They were 
trying to kill (the officers), no doubt. There was a lot on the line and
 the officers responded appropriately.'

One
 suspect was declared dead at the scene, and a second died at a local hospital, authorities said.

Nortenos: Members of the violent street gang are shown wearing red and flashing gang signs

The Nortenos are a notoriously-violent
 street gang ravaging parts of California as they wage war with rival 
gangs, especially the Surenos.

Norteno is Spanish for "northerner,' and sureno is Spanish for 'Southerner.'

Both rival groups were born in the California prison system during the 1980s and 1990s.

Branches of Surenos include the infamous MS-13, which has been referred to by authorities in the past as the world's most dangerous street gang.

Members
 are predominantly Mexican and make money through drug sales and human 
trafficking, but the bulk of their profits come from selling drugs.

They
 often are heavily-tattooed with several gang symbols including the 
number 14, which represents the letter 'n' being the fourteenth in the 
alphabet.

Nortenos also often wear the color red and are known to have a heavy presence in the Bay Area.'

Robbery: The three men allegedly robbed this Bank of the West branch in Hammer Lane and Thornton Road

Stockton police spokesman Joe Silva 
said Thursday morning the men, ages 30 and 27, were city residents.

He identified the third surviving suspect as 19-year-old Jaime Ramos.

The teen was booked into San Joaquin County Jail on suspicion of 
homicide, kidnapping, robbery and attempted murder.

In total, the robbers shot 14 police 
cars and a still undetermined number of homes during the chase.

Upon learning of her death, Holt-Singh's friends and family took to her Facebook page to memorialize her.

'Misty, you are an awesome woman & my heart goes out to you and your family,' read one memorial.

'I can't believe this' wrote another. 'RIP Misty.'

'This is not something you want to hear in the middle of the day,' brother-in-law Ajit Singh told reporters. 'You
 don’t wake up or go to your job thinking something like this is going 
to happen to you.

Another hostage has been identified by family friends as bank employee Kelly Huber. The SUV used in the chase was a Ford Explorer registered to her, authorities said.

Scene: Today, witnesses said the final shoot-out had resembled a warzone. Above, police at the scene

'Yeah, my heart kind of dropped. I am concerned,' said neighbor Amber Harbor. 'I want to know what 
happened and if she was involved and if she is OK. I just hope that 
everything is OK with her.'

Today, witnesses said the final shoot-out had resembled a war zone.

'It sounded like five minutes of straight gunfire,' witness Sam York told KCRA-TV. 'It seemed like it wasn't real.' 

Jose Maldonado, who said he saw the robbers taking the women out of the bank, said the men had rifles that looked like AK-47s slung over their shoulders.

He added that they had also tied up a bank security guard, and didn't seem to care that there were police all around.

'They were not afraid. They weren't going to take no for an answer. These poor women, they were screaming, they were so distraught, so scared,' he said.

The bank declined in a statement to provide information about the victims.

'This is a tragic incident and we are focused on supporting our customers and employees.'
