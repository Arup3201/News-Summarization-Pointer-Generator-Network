A Maryland girl who disappeared after her mother was found dead last week has been located following a nationwide search, authorities say.

The girl, 11-year-old Caitlyn Virts, was located along with her father, Timothy Virts, in a motel in Florence, South Carolina, police said late Friday.

She and her father had been missing since the body of the girl's mother, Bobby Jo Cortez, was found at her home Thursday. Police have since charged Timothy Virts with first-degree murder in the slaying of Cortez, 36.

Manhunt: Timothy Virts abducted his daughter, Caitlyn, and brought her to a motel in South Carolina

The father and his daughter were staying at the Colonial Inn when they were discovered by the owner

The girl was found unharmed, according
 to a statement by the Baltimore County Police Department. Virts is in 
police custody and will be returned to Maryland 'pending an extradition 
process,' the statement said. Police hope to return the girl home as 
soon as possible.

'Detectives
 will be traveling to South Carolina as soon as possible to continue the
 investigation,' said Corp. John Wachter in a statement.

Virts
 and his daughter were located at the Colonial Inn, according to local 
police in Florence. They first rented a room on Thursday night, said 
owner Carol Gause.

'They
 looked fine. She just walked right up with her father. I didn't notice 
anything,' Gause said by phone from the hotel on Saturday.

Gause
 was checking her Facebook page from the front desk around 7 p.m. Friday
 when she saw the Amber Alert posted by a friend and immediately 
recognized Virts and his daughter. She called police and officers 
quickly arrived. She said Virts was arrested without problems and his 
daughter appeared to be OK.

'I
 was startled, but I wasn't worried or frightened. You don't expect to 
ever be involved in something like this,' Gause said. 'But I called 
police and they took over.'

The
 search for Timothy Virts and his daughter, Caitlyn, become a nationwide
 operation, with police believing his daughter could be in danger.

Getaway car: Virts was believed to be using this 1999 Dodge Durango that has Maryland plates

Police tried to track down Virts, who was believed to be using a car belonging to the husband of his alleged victim

The FBI believed Virts, 38, may have 
left the state and taken Caitlyn with him after Ms Cortez's body was 
discovered at her Dundalk home.

An autopsy was due to take place on Friday, and police have not said what used to inflict the injuries.

Police
 spokeswoman Elise Armacost said probable cause for the murder charge 
was based on physical evidence and interviews with people in the house 
at the time Ms Cortez was killed.

Caitlyn's twin sister and Ms Cortez's young son, as well as two other adults, were also living at the home.

Armacost said Virts had been staying there too, for the past several weeks.

The FBI said that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland has charged Virts with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

Victim: Bobbie Jo Cortez was found in her home, covered in multiple cuts, on Thursday

The agency searched nationwide for Caitlyn and Virts and put up digital billboards across the country on the search.

An Amber Alert issued in Maryland was expanded late Thursday to include West Virginia.

A police spokesman told WUSA9 they believed Virts had connections to West Virginia and were 'doing our due diligence' to follow tips.

He was thought to be driving a black 1999 Dodge Durango with Maryland plates 5AJ4458. The car is registered to Ms Cortez's husband, Daniel Williams Cortez.

Mr Cortez, 38, is currently being held at the Baltimore County Detention Center on sexual assault charges. Police said they do not believe he has anything to do with the murder of his wife.
