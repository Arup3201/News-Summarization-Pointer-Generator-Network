A celebrity antiques dealer has bought a piece of graffiti inspired by the London riots which he believes is worth £50,000.

The mural, which he paid a four figure sum for, was sprayed on the garage door of a vegan community centre in Hackney in the aftermath of the disturbances in 2011.

The artwork, called London Riots, was painted by graffiti artist Stik and depicts three stick figures in front of a yellow backdrop and a large flame.

New owner Andrew Lamberty, an expert in 20th century design pieces, said the mural is an important work of social commentary.

Lamberty
 said: 'London Riots is a significant document of contemporary London 
life, every bit as relevant as the way Hogarth captured it in the 18th 
century with the Rake’s Progress.

'There’s every reason to estimate that this Stik piece will go up in value like a Banksy.

'I
 would expect this to fetch anything up to £10,000, and in the very near
 future the market could increase significantly to £50,000 and upwards.'

The garage door in Hackney has been replaced and the proceeds from the sale will go to the not-for-profit Pogo Cafe collective.

A spokesperson for the cafe said: 'Our
 volunteers have been lucky enough to see Stik’s work every time we go 
to the garage. It’s now time for the door to give someone else a chance 
to view it as a window into a different world.

'As a result of the sale to Lamberty, 
Pogo now has a functional space and Stik’s design has given a broken 
garage door a second life as a piece of art.'

Two years ago Stik was a homeless 
street artist only just beginning to leave his strange, distinctive 
stick figures across London’s skyline.

Now he has become one of the British art world’s hottest properties.

Galleries clamour to stage Stik 
exhibitions and his paintings hang in the homes of stars including Elton
 John, Bono, Brian May and Tinie Tempah.

His meteoric rise has led to comparisons with Banksy - the satirical artist whose tags have drawn widespread critical acclaim.

Lamberty stars in BBC2’s Auction Hero series, which first aired on Monday night.
