The onesie - an adult romper suit favoured by the likes of One Direction and Boris Johnson - has become one of the greatest fashion phenomenons of the decade, selling one every 20 seconds.

And now, your furry friend can jump on the trend because OnePiece, the original onesie company, has unveiled a version for dogs.

Describing the £49 romper suit on their website, the company write: 'We are taking all the unique features from the OnePiece Original and adapting it to fit your furry friend.

The dogsie? OnePiece, the original onesie company, has unveiled a range for dogs

For the urban pooch's Christmas list: A camouflage onesie, £49, is a must-have for trendsetting dogs this year

Versatile: The camouflage onesie will suit dogs of all bodyshapes, from a stocky French bulldog to a more slender Jack Russell, pictured here

Does my butt look big in this? The range, which is available in camouflage, navy and classic grey, makes the perfect Christmas gift for your furry friend

'Match it up with your own OnePiece, or let your buddy look fab all by itself.'

The cosy outfit features the traditional Norwegian knit print design and is available in classic grey, navy or camouflage.

Made from 70 per cent cotton and 30 per cent polyester, the onesie even has an opening to attach a lead so your pup can wrap up warm on a walk.

OnePiece isn't the only company to be expanding their range to fashionable pooches; PetsPyjamas.com and Pets At Home also have a collection of similar designs.

Doggone cute: The onesies are sold alongside the OnePiece adult romper suits that drove the trend for onesies

Speaking about the new trend, a spokesperson for PetsPyjamas, said: 'I’m not crazy about onesies for humans but I must say they’re great for dogs.

'If
 you consider dog onesies as a really cosy and comfortable long legged 
coat then they’re a vital and on-trend purchase for your pooch.

'As
 the colder weather kicks in, and especially for short haired dogs like 
dachshunds and Norfolk terriers, they are a winter essential.

Make it personal: PetsPyjamas.com (L) and Pets at Home (R) are also offering a similar style for dogs this Christmas

'At PetsPyjamas we’ve seen onesies as a growing trend so this year we’ve sourced some wonderfully original new designs in an extended range.'

With a recent survey revealing that 
one in six Brits will spend more on their cats and dogs than on their 
other halves this Christmas, the pet gift industry is pulling out all 
the stops and the onepiece for pooches hopes to become a bestseller for 2013.
