Miroslav Klose, Philipp Lahm and Per Mertesacker were given a guard of honour and handed awards before Germany's friendly match against Argentina at the Esprit Arena.

The trio all featured in their side's 2014 World Cup final win against Argentina before deciding to retire from international football.

Klose, who is Germany's all-time goalscorer with 71 goals, called it a day after becoming the most prolific goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.

Miroslav Klose (Lazio) - 137 caps, 71 goals 

Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich) - 113 caps, 5 goals

Per Mertesacker (Arsenal) - 104 caps, 4 goals

The Lazio striker's former team-mates Lahm, who captained Germany to their fourth World Cup win, and Arsenal centre-back Mertesacker also decided to take their names out of the running to be named in Joachim Low's future squads after terrific international careers.

Lahm, Klose and Mertesacker picked up a cumulative total of 354 caps and scored 80 goals between them during their time with the German national team.

Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger has been chosen to replace Lahm as the captain of a much-changed Germany side.

Mertesacker's plaque read, one-hundred-and-ninety-eight centimetres a world champion', while Lahm's said 'four-star captain' and Klose's referenced his somersault celebration.

Assistant manager Hansi Flick was also awarded a plaque, with the text 'System team player'.
