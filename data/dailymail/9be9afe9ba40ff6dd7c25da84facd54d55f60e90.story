Suspected drug dealers threw bags of cannabis and
 loose cash out of windows in a bid to get rid of evidence as police carried out a series of raids across the capital this morning,

Officers arrested two teenagers who have been confirmed as brothers as part of the operation targeting suspected drug dealers in London.

The boys, aged 14 and 15 years old are thought to be prominent gang members in Westminster.

Hiding evidence: Drugs and money were thrown out of a window as police force entry into a property in Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate

Arrested: A man is arrested and put into a police van from Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate

Patrol: A lone police officer checks the area outside the block of flats on the Churchill Gardens estate

The juveniles were among 22 people 
rounded up by over 200 police officers who were hunting down dealers 
with connections to gangs and drugs. They were all aged between 14 and 25.

Nineteen of the 22 were arrested this morning, 18 on supplying controlled class A and class B drugs, and one woman was arrested on possession of a class A drug.

Police battered down the door of one suspected dealer at 6.15am on the Churchill Gardens Estate in Pimlico.

But as officers used a battering ram, 
known as a rabbit, on the door, screaming 'police', bags of cannabis and
 loose cash were thrown out the window and into the bushes below the 
second floor flat.

During the raids, a 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with the intent to supply.

The arrests were made for supplying controlled substances not for intent to supply as previously reported.

Raid: Officers carried out dawn drugs raids across London today - the culmination of a five month intelligence led operation from officers across Westminster

Simultaneously, another flat in Chaucer House was knocked on, rather than broken down, and a 17-year-old man was arrested.

Another
 two addresses in the affluent Chelsea Gardens, only yards from the 
Chelsea Flower Show, were raided, but no arrests were made.

Kicked off: This is the aftermath of police forcing entry into a property in Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate

Operation 
Accomack was spearheaded by Belgravia Police Station, they had pictures 
of 22 suspects with code names such as 'Syria' and Greece'.

Some of the targets had 'arrested' pinned to the picture, with more expected to be pinned down as the day progressed.

Today
 was the culmination of a five month operation, in which police have 
acted on tip offs from people around two Pimlico Estates Churchill 
Gardens and Warwick Estate, who have raised concerns about prolific drug
 dealing of cannabis, heroin, crack cocaine and MDMA within the borough.

Following
 an extensive intelligence led-investigation by officers, police say it 
had become clear that there was open drugs market in certain parts of 
the borough and that local gangs were involved in dealing and the 
violence that goes with it.

Officers also carried out a weapon sweep following a spate 
of stabbings across the borough inÂ  recent months.

The estates are where Hani Hicham Abou 
El Kheir, 16, died after he was chased and stabbed by a ten-strong gang 
armed with a 'formidable' array of weapons in a 'brutal and merciless 
attack' near his home in Pimlico last January.

In the past gangs have hidden knives 'in plant pots in every corner of the estate' until police launched a crackdown.

But the drug gangs still sought ways to stash away their arsenals on the estate which are just streets away from where the health secretary and a TV presenter live.

A
 public meeting is due to take place on the 29 May at the Churchill 
Gardens Hall, giving local residents the opportunity to get an update 
following today's arrests.

Acting Detective Chief Inspector Philip Grindell said: 'Today's series of warrants and arrests are as a direct result of concerns we have had from residents and we are committed to listening to the local community and making Westminster a safer borough for people to live and work in.

'We have a clear mandate to reduce the drug activity and the violence that is associated with. Along with the local authority and partner agencies we will continue to divert young people away from gangs to ensure areas such as the Churchill Gardens estate are a more enjoyable place to live.

Cash and drugs: Evidence bags containing money, drugs and jewellery are taken away by officers from a property in Chaucer House

'Our work addressing these issues on the borough does not end here today and over the coming weeks we will continue to provide a visible and reassuring police presence across Westminster.

'I would like to personally thank the local community for supporting us with our efforts in disrupting and dismantling criminal activity in Westminster, this could not have been achieved without them.

'We still require their help and support in the coming weeks and months and we would encourage anyone with any information about on going drug and gang activity within the borough to come forward and speak to us.

'Any information provided will be treated in the strictest of confidence.'

Sergeant Simon Taylor added that were weapons had become a big problem.

He said: 'In a spell 
last month over five days, we had an attempted abduction, a kidnap, a 
man stabbed in the head and another stabbing. That's just here, in South
 West One.'

He said that criminals are now thinking of new ways to hide weapons.

There tends to be a marker where the weapons are kept, so people know where they can find them quickly. Like golf balls for example. You can see them in the dark, and criminals will know there is a weapon there if needed.

'Even the money they get from crime - they will go to bookies and 'wash' it through the slot machines. They are always a step ahead.

'Within 10 minutes of opening this office, a quick search found two knives and a screwdriver. There were knives in plant pots in every corner of the estate.'

Although Sergeant Taylor says he is confident that the 'bad guys' from the estate were arrested in the raids, he believes there may be a spike in crime.

'I anticipate there will be a minor spike in crime, where people have a greater confidence to call us, but I do think we will have a drop in crime in the near future.

'We have seen gangs from other areas such as east London who have been looking at the estate to see if there is scope to move in, so there could be a power struggle.

'There's a couple more who we are after who are on a middle level, who are out of our sphere, but we are confident we have got the right people this morning, no problem at all.'

'We have unusual gangsters here, they tend to wear school uniforms and ride a bike.

'We also border areas of untold wealth, so there is always a market for crime.
