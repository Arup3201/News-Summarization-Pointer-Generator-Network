These days, Barbie can climb the career ladder to its summit and become a pilot, an engineer, a dentist or even a racing car driver.

But in 1965, Slumber Party Barbie came not with a PAYE slip but with a set of pink bathroom scales, permanently set to a rather scrawny 110lbs (50kg), and a diet book instructing her on how to lose weight, with just one instruction: 'DON'T EAT!'

The controversial doll also included a pink satin pyjama top and bottoms, a pink robe with a sash, pink open-toe heels with blue pompoms, pink curlers, bobby pins and a blue brush and comb.

The scale was removed just one year later, and the 1966/7 version renamed Barbie Sleepytime Gal, but she still came equipped with her diet book and its one simple rule.
