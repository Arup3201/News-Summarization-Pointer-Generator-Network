Manchester United risk losing another top talent, having failed to open talks with Brazil Under-20 star Andreas Pereira.

It is another test of their commitment to young players after the loss of French star Paul Pogba to Juventus.

Midfielder Pereira, who was named on the bench by Louis van Gaal against QPR last weekend, is able to talk to other clubs from January 1 as the clock runs down on his deal which expires next summer.

Still only 18, he is one of the development players promoted by Van Gaal to be part of the first-team squad this season in the belief he has the ability to make it at Old Trafford. He was picked by Brazil for an Under-20s tournament in China last summer — a rare accolade for a European-based player. 

The stand-off over his future has echoes of Pogba, who became a symbol for the lack of long-term planning at Old Trafford in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final years when he was allowed to leave for nothing after failing to agree a new deal. 

Embarrassingly, United later considered buying him back for £50million after he’d gone on to become the best young midfield player in Europe.

Pereira could be involved against Leicester today having scored for United Under 21s against Sunderland in midweek. He was born in Belgium to Brazilian parents.

I joined United from PSV aged 16. He was recently taken aside by Van Gaal for a pep talk with the United boss rating him alongside Adnan Januzaj, Tyler Blackett, James Wilson and Jesse Lingard as United’s best home-grown players. 

Van Gaal said last night: ‘The class of ’92 were guardians of the culture of the club. It is very important that a club like Manchester United have guardians and therefore you need a very good youth education. 

‘It is very important and I did it with Barcelona. I gave debuts to Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes. ‘I want to do that but the youth player has to take their chance.’ 

Van Gaal’s big decision today is if and how he can squeeze his ‘famous five’ — Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Falcao, Angel di Maria and Juan Mata — into the same team.
