Premier League chief Richard Scudamore‘s position as the most powerful man in English football is under growing threat as the storm over his sexist behaviour rages in all quarters of the game.

The Premier League have brought in crisis management agency Milltown Partners to help keep their beleaguered CEO in office, with Scudamore facing yet more embarrassing revelations in Sunday’s newspapers.

Premier League sponsors Barclays led the critics about Scudamore’s inappropriate exchange of emails with lawyer Nick West. In private, the bank reportedly said they were ‘deeply disappointed’ and do not want to see the escalating storm damage their reputation.

But Milltown, specialists in reputation issues and privacy protection, will find it very hard to keep this controversy under wraps.

Women in Football, a network representing more than 1,000 females working in the national game, have written to the interim Premier League chairman Peter McCormick, as well as all clubs and sponsors, detailing their ‘shock and dismay’ at the content of the emails and the reaction of the football authorities, saying an apology is not enough. They want an independent review and wholesale changes to governance around equality.

Edward Lord, a senior member of the FA’s Inclusion Advisory Board, who has been the most vocal of Scudamore’s opponents since the Sunday Mirror revealed the email exchange, says the chief executive’s position is ‘now looking untenable’.

And top London law firm DLA Piper have launched a full-scale probe into the role played in the email correspondence by West, one of their partners and the TV rights lawyer whom Sportsmail revealed on Friday as being the other major figure in the exchanges.

A DLA Piper spokesman confirmed: ‘We uphold the highest professional standards as a firm, and this matter is being fully investigated.’

Scudamore’s situation will be scrutinised by the Premier League’s audit and remuneration committee on Monday with the FA’s Inclusion Board verdict the following day.

Women in Football wrote: ‘Women in the football industry feel strongly any apology is not enough. It is important to demonstrate the Premier League’s governance on equality is not merely lip service but instead an integral part of the values of your organisation, values that are to be defended and upheld when challenged, no matter how senior the person who falls foul. We feel an independent review is essential for trust and credibility and presents an opportunity for real change.’

No place: Minister of Sport and Equalities Helen Grant has expressed her disappointment at Scudamore

A Barclays spokesman said: ‘We have expressed our views to the Premier League in what was a private conversation.’

Lord wrote on his personal website blog: ‘If Scudamore doesn’t accept the heinous nature of his sexist remarks and the impact they have had, not only on women in the game, but on the perception they create of football’s commitment to equality and inclusion in general, then regrettably I must reach the conclusion that he may be in the wrong job.

‘He should seriously think about his position this weekend.’
