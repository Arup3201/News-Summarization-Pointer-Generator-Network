British women hate their love handles more than anything else on their body

Wonky nose? We can come to terms with it. Terrible teeth? Tolerable. Big bottom? Bearable.

But love handles are a different story entirely, it seems.

Hard-to-shift fat on the hips is the biggest body hang-up among women, according to a study.

Excess weight on the hips is our biggest body hang-up, topping the list above 'saddle-bags' (fatty outer thighs) and muffin-tops, according to a new survey.

After those top three come bingo wings and inner thighs.

The results reflect the changing shape of British women, with the 'apple' type - who store fat around the middle - now more common than big-bottomed 'pears'.

Donnamarie McBride, co-founder of Harley Street cosmetic clinic Lovelite, said that more than two-thirds of women who come in for fat removal treatments want to target fat on their stomachs, hips and the sides of their torsos.

And it seems that even celebrities with 'perfect' bodies are not immune to such feminine insecurities.

Singer Mollie King of the Saturdays has admitted to being 'very self-conscious in a 
bikini' and says she would never get her stomach out on stage.

Made In Chelsea's 
Binky Felstead has also spoken out about her body insecurities.

The reality TV star revealed she doesn't like her 'tummy and love handles' and is currently
undergoing sessions of a non-invasive fat reduction treatment named Lipoglaze
to help with shifting the weight on these areas.

Meanwhile, pear-shaped women including Cheryl Cole are more concerned about their legs.

The star said: 'I don't like my legs. I haven't got much of them for a 
start. If I was dressing myself I'd probably cover them up.'

American actress Katherine 
Heigal has even admitted that her thighs are her 'obsession', saying: 'I always complexed about my 
thighs. I think they're very fat. This is the only part of my body which
I have no control of. My thighs are my obsession.'

Even Elle 'The Body' 
Macpherson is not immune to insecurities about her figure, admitting: 'It's taken me a long time to feel good about my body. Just like 
everyone, and despite my nickname, I have felt unhappy in my skin.'

Love handles are what British women are least happy with on their bodies, regardless of age or size

Model and presenter Kelly Brook, the model and presenter regularly voted by both men and 
women as having the best bikini body, said: 'My arms are a bit 
wobbly'.

Kim Kardashian also added: 'I've never been a big fan of my thighs, but I do love my 
stomach when it’s in shape.'

Donnamarie McBride, co-founder of the Lovelite clinic, said: 'We've 
noticed for a long time that women are self-conscious of their hips and 
want to lose their lovehandles.

'Fat on the hips can be the most 
noticeable, and is hard to disguise if trying to keep up with the latest
fashion for skinny jeans and body con dresses.

'Women will 
always focus on parts of their body that they don't like, it's almost in
our DNA to obsess over these things.'

Even celebrities such as Kelly Brook, left, and Elle Macpherson, right, have issues with their bodies
