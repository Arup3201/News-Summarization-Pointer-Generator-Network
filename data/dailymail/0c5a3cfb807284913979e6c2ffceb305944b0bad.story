Over a hundred people have held a candlelight vigil in honour of the eight children found stabbed to death in Cairns on Friday morning.

Residents of Manoora arrived at Munroe Martin Park bearing candles and flowers to lay on the ground, still in shock at the news that eight of their own had been taken too soon.

The children, aged between 18 months and 15 years, were reportedly discovered by their 20-year-old brother at the Murray Street residence, along with a  woman who had suffered a stab wound to the heart.

Pastor Michael Dalla Vecchia called on the people of Cairns to 'stick together as a community'.

The Bishop of Cairns James Foley also issued a statement about the tragedy.

'To say this has been a dreadful week is almost an obscene understatement: the Sydney siege; an 18 year old taken by a shark off Pt. Douglas; the Pakistan school massacre; and on Friday’s 1pm radio news the headline that eight children had been stabbed at a Cairns suburb - Manoora. And all this in the week before Christmas,' the statement said.

'Yet, as we saw in the aftermath of the Sydney siege, the very worst some people can do - may bring out the very best in so many more.'

One mourner on Twitter contemplated that 'Children are our hopes distilled. Now all gone & blown away. So tragic & gut wrenching in Manoora.This world sure is a most testing place.'

‘It’s heartbreaking knowing there were kids involved, I think it’s a big shock to the community.' 

Specialist police officers are now on their way from Brisbane to help with the situation and the crime scene is completely locked down. There are no formal suspects as yet.

'There's not much else we can say, but we have a range of strategies in place to support the family through this very difficult time,' Detective Inspector Asnicar said.

'It's a tragic and traumatic with so many deceased in one place. It's right up there with some of the most serious things I've ever had to deal with.' 

Lisa Thaiday, a cousin of the alleged mother, said that she was in shock.

'I just can't believe it,' she said. 'Those poor babies.'

She said the 20-year-old man who discovered the bodies was being consoled by other family members.

'I'm going to see him now, he needs comforting,' Ms Thaiday said. She described the family and extended relatives as close-knit and many live in surrounding suburbs.

'We're a big family and most of us are from the (Torres) Strait,' she said, adding that she rushed to the scene after hearing about the incident on the radio.
