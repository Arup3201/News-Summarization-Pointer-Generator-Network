Doomed invitation: Jaylen Fryberg allegedly invited a group of friends to lunch where he pulled out a gun and shot five of them before committing suicide 

A popular student responsible for a shooting at a Washington state high school on Friday invited his victims to lunch by text message, then shot them at their table, investigators said Monday.

Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary said at a news conference that the five students were at a lunch table when they were shot by 15-year-old Jaylen Fryberg. Fryberg then committed suicide.

Detectives are digging through reams of text messages, phone and social media records as part of an investigation that could take months, Trenary said.

'The question everybody wants is, "Why?"'Trenary said. 'I don't know that the "why" is something we can provide.'

Fryberg, a football player who was named a prince on the school's Homecoming court one week before the killings, was a member of a prominent Tulalip Indian Tribes family. 

He seemed happy although he was also upset about a girl, friends said. 

It appears that girl was 14-year-old victim Zoe Galasso, who had recently started dating his cousin Andrew Fryberg, currently in critical condition at the hospital. 

The shooter's Twitter feed was recently full of vague, anguished postings, like 'It won't last ... It'll never last,' and 'I should have listened. ... You were right ... The whole time you were right.'

On Friday, after texting five friends to invite them to lunch, he pulled out a handgun in the cafeteria and started shooting. 

Zoe died at the scene while friend Gia Soiano, 14, died at the hospital from her injuries on Sunday. 

Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, remains in critical condition at the hospital, along with Fryberg's two cousins, Nate Hatch, 14, and Andrew, 15. 

Hatch, who was shot in the jaw, is the only victim who has shown improvement. He was upgraded to satisfactory condition Monday in intensive care at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, while Andrew  remained in critical condition there.

It has been claimed Jaylen had a crush on Zoe Galasso and became heartbroken when she dated his cousin, Andrew.

Zoe was sitting around a table with her friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday when Jaylen Fryberg opened fire.

She was pictured attending the homecoming dance at the Washington school with Andrew Fryberg after she and Jaylen Fryberg fell out, just days before the deadly attack.

Jaylen had previously treated Andrew like a brother, and was devastated to learn the girl who rejected him and chosen his cousin instead.

In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!'

The teenage girls are believed to be friends of Jaylen Fryberg, with witnesses suggesting he targeted them in a room full of hundreds of students.

Lukas Thorington, 14, a freshman at Marysville's other public high school who grew up with Zoe and Shaylee said they were outgoing, popular kids.

He told the Seattle Times: 'Zoe was very outgoing. She was into sports. She was nice and awesome. She was fun to hang out with.'

Corey Williams, 37, is friends with Zoe's mother and wanted to help, so he set up a fundraising page to raise money for the Galasso family. Donations have already exceeded $14,000.

He told the paper: 'I'm pretty surprised. I put $10,000 as the goal as a pie-in-the-sky thing. I'm shocked.'

A picture uploaded to Facebook shows Shaylee posing alongside the Jaylen Fryberg.

The popular schoolboy who was a member of the football and wrestling team shot five people with his father's gun, before turning the gun on himself.

A friend on Twitter said Jaylen was 'heartbroken' over a girl and didn't know what to do. She added that he 'wasn't a bad kid'.

He had also written messages on his own Twitter page suggesting he may have been facing some troubles, such as: 'It breaks me... It actually does.'

Fryberg, 15, named on the center candle, opened fire on Friday, October 24

After her passing on Sunday, Gia's family said her organs would be donated.

'We are devastated by this senseless tragedy,' her family said in a statement, read at a news conference by Providence Regional Medical Center's Dr. Joanne Roberts. 'Gia is our beautiful daughter, and words cannot express how much we will miss her.'

Meanwhile, Nate Hatch has taken to Twitter to forgive his 'brother' Jaylen for the shooting which has left him seriously injured. 

On Monday he wrote: 'I love you and I forgive you jaylen rest in peace' while in the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle where he is being treated for a gunshot wound to his jaw.

Nate also took to Facebook to update his friends saying he was 'grateful to be alive' after his condition was upgraded from serious to satisfactory.

Spokeswoman Susan Gregg says he's awake and breathing on his own and still in the intensive care unit. 

Nate and Jaylen grew up together in the Native American Tulalip tribe along with Andrew Fryberg, 15, another brother-like cousin who is in a critical condition in Harborview Medical Center following the attack.

Nate's grandfather, Donald Hatch, revealed Nate started communicating with his family by writing notes as he is unable to speak.

Mr Hatch told King5 reporter Alex Rozier that Nate knows it was his close cousin Jaylen who opened fire on the group of friends.

He said one of the notes Nate had written to his family reads: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'.

Mr Hatch added: I think Nate's either getting his memory back or somebody mentioned what had happened.

'And it kind of broke his heart to hear, "why would my brother do that to me," even though they're cousins. 'Why would my brother do that to me?"

Last week Nate's mother, Denise Hatch-Anderson wrote on Facebook, thanking the community for their support in the aftermath of the shooting.

She wrote: 'Thank you so much from the mother of Nate Hatch... i cant [sic] thank everyone from our community for the outpouring love that has been shown [sic] to me since this tragic happened... i love everyone!!! No time for hate just love.'

Mourners gather at a memorial set up outside Marysville Pilchuck high School on Monday, October 27

Trenary also confirmed that the .40-caliber handgun used in the shooting had been legally purchased by one of Fryberg's relatives. It remains unclear how Fryberg obtained the weapon.

The Snohomish County Medical Examiner on Monday ruled Fryberg's death a suicide. There had been some question over whether he might have shot himself accidentally as a teacher tried to intervene, but Trenary said Monday that investigators confirmed there was no physical contact between the teacher and the gunman.

At the memorial outside the school Monday, a group of mourners hugged each other tightly at 10:39am — the minute the shooting was reported Friday. Flowers and signs were zip-tied to a chain-link fence lined with red and white balloons reflecting the school's colors. Many referenced the victims and said they'd be missed.
