Danny Welbeck delivered for under-fire Roy Hodgson as the Arsenal striker scored a brace in England's 2-0 win over Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier.  

The former Manchester United outcast found the net after breaks in the 58th minute and in time added on as England, much maligned after their uninspiring 1-0 friendly win over Norway, got off to a perfect start against their main Group E rivals.

Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives his verdict on the performance of the players. 

Confidence: Danny Welbeck was man of the match against Switzerland after scoring twice

 Winner: England players crowed around Danny Welbeck after the Arsenal signing scored against Switzerland

Cool finish: Welbeck takes his chance four minutes into time added on with aplomb

ENGLAND (4-4-2)

JOE HART: Made a good save with his feet in the first half and did well to stop another in the second just before England’s goal. 7

JOHN STONES: Still something of an emergency right back but will be pleased with his night’s work when under pressure. 6 

Leg out: England goalkeeper Joe Hart saves an excellent Swiss chance with his out-stretched right leg

GARY CAHILL: Consistent, solid and made a match-saving clearance in the second half to block a certain Swiss goal on the line. 7

PHIL JONES: A mixed bag. Solid but at times too theatrical with his defending but unlucky not to score with a textbook header. 6 

Strong: England's Phil Jones gets a good connection on a header but sees it well-saved by the Swiss keeper

LEIGHTON BAINES: Would have liked to see him get forward more but an improvement on the Norway game and did well defensively. 6.5

JACK WILSHERE: Not sure he’s the one for that deep-lying role and occasionally ran into trouble with nobody to cover him. 6

Too deep: Jack Wilshere was put in a holding role that he wasn't entirely comfortable with

JORDAN HENDERSON: Would like to see him more on the ball but his energy cannot be questioned. He didn’t stop running all night. 6

FABIAN DELPH: An over-enthusiastic start but played with great responsibility and unlucky not to win a penalty on debut. 6.5 

Mixed night: Fabian Delph got off to an over-zealous start but justified his inclusion on his starting debut

RAHEEM STERLING: Not his best night and didn’t run at people like he does for Liverpool but a fantastic pass for Welbeck’s first goal. 6.5

WAYNE ROONEY: Showed good touches, reliable in possession and did well to drive forward and release Sterling for the goal. 6.5

DANNY WELBECK: Seems like his move to Arsenal has instantly given him the confidence to be the main striker. 8 

Danger man: Raheem Sterling finds space as he threatens the Swiss defence but didn't have a great game

Skipper: England captain Wayne Rooney fires a header over the top 

SUBSTITUTES

Milner (for Wilshere 73, 6)

Jagielka (for Jones 77)

Lambert (for Rooney 90)

Not used: Forster, Rose, Chambers, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Townsend 

MANAGER - ROY HODGSON: Under more pressure than anyone else but brave to pick Delph and using the Liverpool system worked to great effect. 8

TEAM AVERAGE: 6.5 

Perfect timing: Danny Welbeck arrives to meet Sterling's cross to give England the 1-0 lead

SWITZERLAND (4-3-2-1)

Sommer 5.5 

Lichsteiner 6.5

Defiant: Switzerland keeper Yann Sommer, of Borussia Monchengladbach, made a number of great saves

Going in hard: Swiss defender Stephan Lichtsteiner makes a sliding tackle on Delph

Djourou 6

Von Bergen 5.5 

Rodriguez 6 

Behrami 6.5  

Ball security: Napoli midfielder Gokhan Inler protects the ball from Wayne Rooney

Inler 7 

Mehmedi 6 (Drmic 64 5.5) 

Xhaka 7 (Dzemaili 74 5.5)

Shaqiri 7 

Seferovic 7 

Keeping tight: Swiss danger man Xherdan Shaqiri is marked closely by England's Leighton Baines (left)

Subs not used: Hitz, Benito, Senderos, Widmer, Frei, Stocker, Fernandes, Kasami, Schar, Burki.

Manager: Vladimir Petkovic 5

TEAM AVERAGE: 6.4

REFEREE - CUNEYT CAKIR (Turkey): Should have booked Fabian Delph for his first challenge. Got the penalty shout from Haris Seferovic after Phil Jones’ challenge right but called it wrong when Johan Djourou wiped out Delph. 5
