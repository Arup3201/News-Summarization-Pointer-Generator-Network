Manchester City must decide who will make way for Wilfried Bony in their Champions League squad by February 3 — three weeks before they meet Barcelona in the first knockout round.

Bony’s arrival from Swansea has raised the number of ‘foreign’ players in City’s first team to 17, which is one more than the Premier League champions are allowed this season as punishment for breaching UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations.

Wilfried Bony should solve a striker shortage at City, but his arrival has created another problem

Willy Caballero is one of the first-team squad whose European place is under threat since the Ivorian's arrival

Stevan Jovetic is another who could be excluded from City's Champions League squad

The problem will be solved if City can be persuaded to sell Stevan Jovetic, but if not manager Manuel Pellegrini faces a tough decision. Goalkeeper Willy Caballero and full backs Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov are the other players understood to be most under threat.

Pellegrini said: ‘We must see which of the players will not be in the squad for Champions League because we don’t have space.’

City midfielder Yaya Toure believes the media should be more respectful of religion following the Charlie Hebdo shootings.

Toure, who is a Muslim, said: ‘When you hear something like that it’s very disappointing — I feel very sorry for the families.

‘Of course, it’s a newspaper trying to say something. But sometimes it hurts people you know.’
