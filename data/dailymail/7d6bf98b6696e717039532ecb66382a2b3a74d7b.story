A drunken 21-year-old who threw a party in an empty home smeared white paint over the floor, windows and work surfaces and even flung it inside the washing machine.

Martyn Harvey broke into the house - which was is in the process of being renovated - and used the paint to daub slang phrases on the windows in an act of 'mean and nasty' vandalism that is expected to cost around £1,000 to clean up.

Harvey was today given a 20 week suspended prison sentence and ordered to do 220 hours of unpaid work following his drunken spree at the house in Plymouth, Devon.

Harvey admitted burglary by entering the house as a trespasser with intent to do unlawful damage at Plymouth Crown Court.

The out-of-work plumber invited nine of his friends to the house, but said he alone was responsible for the mess after finding a tin of white paint under the stairs.

Police traced Harvey through a finger print on a cider can discarded at the property in Plymouth.

Judge Paul Darlow said: 'This was a mean and nasty act of vandalism.

'The fact you were drunk makes matters worse.'

Harvey's defence barrister Nick Lewin said: 'This was an act of stupidity rather than pure criminality.

'It is not worth throwing away the key on him yet, he is not rotten. If he goes to prison he runs the risk of becoming rotten.'

Harvey was sentenced to 20 weeks in jail, suspended for two years, and given an 18 month supervision order.

The 21-year-old was also ordered to do pay out £500 in compensation, undertake 220 hours of unpaid work, and was placed under a four month curfew.
