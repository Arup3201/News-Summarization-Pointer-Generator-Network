Hulk has caused a stir by posting pictures of himself flying into Luton Airport with his Zenit team-mate Luis Neto. He is being offered to clubs in England while Monaco have expressed an interest following the injury to his former Porto strike partner Radamel Falcao.

The Brazil forward's representatives have been looking to talk to Manchester City and Chelsea to see if they have interest.

Chelsea, who will be without Fernando Torres for a month, made a substantial offer to Zenit St Petersburg in August for the 27-year-old and could pave way for his arrival if they accept Trabzonspor's bid for Demba Ba.

West Ham are pressing ahead with discussions today over loan deals for AC Milan's Antonio Nocerino and Roma's Marco Borriello, as revealed in Sportsmail, but they have made a surprise move for Leeds United favourite Ross McCormack.

The Scotland forward has scored 18 goals this season and the Hammers have made an offer of £3million plus an extra £1m based on appearances for the 27-year-old. Leeds knocked back bids from Middlesbrough at the start of the season and are holding out for £5m. A Premier League club would be difficult to resist for the player.

West Ham have also watched Osasuna midfielder Raoul Loe who could be prised out for £2m. Manager Sam Allardyce wants a greater presence in midfield and Loe is an option with Nocerino while Raul Meireles is also under consideration.

AC Milan's interest in Kasper Schmeichel has prompted Leicester to search for a new goalkeeper. They have asked about Wayne Hennessey at Wolves but are now looking at FC Groningen's Marco Bizot.

The 6ft 5in keeper is a Holland U21 keeper who developed at Ajax before ending up at Groningen, where he has caught the eye with some match-saving performances in an ever-present season that has seen them challenge for a Europa League place.

Schmeichel, 27, is out of contract in the summer but Milan need younger blood to freshen up a squad that is struggling badly. Wales keeper Hennessey has been a target for Crystal Palace also but is keen on a move to West Ham.

Tottenham have been looking at bringing in another striker but, despite Tim Sherwood's hopes of buying British, they may still find the better quality is abroad.

They have been offered Fabio Quagliarella of Juventus, Inter Milan's unhappy-but-versatile midfielder Fredy Guarin and Hulk. Guarin is not on the wanted list nor is he at Manchester United. Tottenham technical director Franco Baldini, however, is apparently due in Italy on Friday night.

Meanwhile, Inter Milan's Mauro Icardi is the latest striker to be considered by Stoke City as they continue their search for another forward. Inter have so far blocked a loan deal for the 20-year-old though.

Inter are keen to add much needed fight to their squad by reviving interest in Southampton bad boy Dani Osvaldo.

Nottingham Forest are back on the trail of Algerian striker Rafik Djebbour. The Olympiacos forward has completed a loan with Sivasspor in Turkey.

Bradford have had a bid, understood to be in the region of £75,000, rejected for Halifax striker Lee Gregory.

Blackburn winger Fabio Nunes has joined Serie B side US Latina Calcio on a free transfer.
