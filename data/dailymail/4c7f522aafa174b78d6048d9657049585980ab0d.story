Men’s new favourite chore, believe it or not, is washing and cleaning, but only if they get to do it with their most beloved tool - a jet washer.

It is now the top choice for DIY tools for men in Britain, replacing the power drill, the powerful cleaning device is now the most popular gadget.

It is the first time in almost 40 years that the power drill has been pipped to the top slot.

Real men clean: The jet washer has bagged the top spot as the most popular DIY tool among British men

Littlewoods Retail Director Gary Kibble said: ‘Men have to have an excuse to use a power drill, such as putting up shelves or making a cabinet.

'The pleasure of using the drill is, unfortunately, only a brief part of a much longer procedure, and imposes other less enjoyable responsibilities.

’However using a jet washer is an end in itself. Men can blast away the dirt from a drive for hours at a time.

'And when they stop using it, there is no requirement to possess other skills such as woodwork or construction.'

Bigger is better: The jet washer replaced the power drill as the most popular tool, and according to sales figures the most powerful devices are the ones men love the most

‘Also, a jet washer can be combined with the nation’s second favourite weekend hobby - washing the car.’

Powerful jet washers which come with a water lance and a special circular patio cleaner are the biggest sellers according to Littlewoods.

Some have air cooled motors, dirt blasters, and can develop over 110 bar pressure - enough to shift even the most stubborn piece of moss, the retailer said.

As well as cleaning drives and patios, jet washers are also used for more unconventional purposes such as cleaning the barbecue, stripping old paint from garden furniture, weeding paths and blowing holes in tough soil to plant flower bulbs.
