To the deafening sound of One Direction, mothers and their pubescent daughters roam the giant basement toting enormous shopping baskets filled to the brim.

But the baskets do not contain Capri pants, sundresses or other summer fashion staples, but thongs, push-up bras and skimpy knickers in neon shades, lace and leopard prints.

Welcome to Pink, the teenage fashion department of U.S. lingerie giant Victoria’s Secret on London’s Bond Street. 

Risque: Annabel and Elsa, 13, with the racy underwear on sale at Pink

The brand, which is known for its risqué advertising campaigns and multi-million pound fashion shows featuring supermodels dubbed Victoria’s Secret Angels, opened its doors in Britain last summer, bringing its signature brand of overtly sexy underwear to a nation reared on M&S smalls.

I turn around, keen to ask my 13-year-old daughter Elsa what she thinks of the store. But she is long gone — rifling through the rows of candy-coloured padded ‘plunge’ bras.

A woman in front of me is combing through piles of bottom-revealing ‘mini cheeksters’ and eye-wateringly skimpy ‘V-strings’, until she emerges, triumphant, with a pair of extremely brief, lace-trimmed purple knickers. I assume she is buying them for herself, until she hands them to the 12-year-old schoolgirl by her side.

The store seems to be heaving, but just last month the brand found itself mired in controversy with the launch of ‘Bright Young Things’, part of their Pink lingerie range aimed at teenagers featuring slogans such as ‘call me’ and ‘feeling lucky’.

Parents were outraged, accusing the company of seeking to ‘sexualise’ very young girls. An online petition started by a mother to protest against the range has collected almost 19,000 signatures.

After the outcry, some items were removed from the website and the company released a statement describing Pink as ‘a line for college-age women’.

Capturing a younger market: Victoria's Secret said their Pink range is intended for 'college-age' girls

Speaking at a conference to publicise the new collection, Stuart Burgdoerfer, the company’s chief financial officer, reportedly said: ‘When somebody’s 15 or 16 years old, what do they want to be?

'They want to be older and they want to be cool like the girl in college and that’s part of the magic of what we do at Pink.’

The strategy is working. By 2010, six years after its launch in the U.S, Pink had recorded £650million in sales and had become so popular that stand alone stores had been launched in North America.

But, as any mother knows, if something’s targeted at 16-year-olds, it’ll be 12 and  13-year-olds who covet it most. In fact, when the London store opened last year, my daughter and her friends went wild with excitement.

They knew all about Pink from its glamorous advertising in fashion magazines and couldn’t wait to buy in to the brand. One of Elsa’s friends even attended the shop opening.

Yet step inside London’s Victoria’s Secret, and it’s clear that Pink couldn’t be more dissimilar to Gap Kids, H&M or any other mainstream teen brand.

In order to reach Pink, youngsters have to walk through the main store, which is kitted out like a bordello. The walls and floor are covered with gleaming black lacquer, mannequins display risqué underwear and numerous French mirrors reflect sheer lace babydoll nighties, corsets, thongs and suspenders.

Concerns: Elsa thought the store was like a 'girls' dream world' but her mother worries it's too raunchy

Once downstairs, many of the items in the Pink collection are far from suitable for girls of that age.

Lingerie
ranges have names like ‘the Pink flirt collection’ and bras are 
categorised as ‘the heartbreaker plunge,’ ‘date bras’ and ‘campus 
push-ups’, and are typically padded, under-wired or trimmed with lace.

Many
of the knickers are blatantly provocative: there are piles of lacy 
thongs and bright pink knickers which invite you to, ‘enjoy the view’.

Looking through one of the many displays of knickers are 14-year-old Sophie Clarke, 12-year-old Jessie, her 11-year-old sister Amy and their mum Nikki, here from Winchester for a day’s shopping.

‘I am happy to be here with my mum,’ says Sophie quietly. ‘I think if I came with people my own age, I would feel under pressure to buy some of the more sexy items to show off.’

Pink was conceived as a transition range, to introduce teenage girls to the Victoria’s Secret brand before moving to the more adult lines — like a McDonald’s Happy Meal, but for lingerie.

But not all the teens shopping in the store are plumping for modest, age-appropriate choices.

Mags McLaren from Woking is shopping with her daughter Allana, aged 12.

‘Most of the bras are underwired and when we first came last year, Allana wanted desperately to have one. But I felt uncomfortable about my young daughter wearing something which would give her “cleavage”. As for the main Victoria’s Secret shop upstairs, it is totally off limits.’

Last month I wrote in Femail about the huge pressures which I, as a mother, feel that young teenagers are under to grow up too soon. Looking around Pink, which is positively humming with middle-class mothers and daughters, I feel depressingly vindicated.

Of course, the fear for parents like me is that, in buying sexy underwear, our daughters will send out the message that they are ready to have sex long before this is the case.

Dr Aric Sigman, a psychologist specialising in child health education, explains that this is not unfounded.

‘Through a label like Pink, Victoria’s Secret is clearly playing to the aspirational tendencies of the young. There is a clear line which can be drawn between exposing children to premature sexual cues and increased underage sexual behaviour.’

I spot Elsa again, bursting with excitement and keen to show me the contents of her basket which includes several underwired bras as well as T-shirts and a sweatshirt. Fortunately, she has avoided the more provocative knickers and looks disparagingly at those emblazoned with slogans.

As we approach the changing rooms —– styled as gold and white mini-boudoirs — I am struggling to understand the appeal of Pink.

Elsa explains: ‘Teenagers want to buy underwear because it’s something that ten-year-olds can’t do.

‘We are more image conscious than you were at my age and that means getting the whole look, not just clothes but hair, make-up and underwear too.’

But if raunchy underwear is part of that look, doesn’t she feel that there is a danger of giving out the wrong signals?

‘Well obviously by 13, you are starting to think about being more attractive to boys, but my friends and I like it more because it’s fashionable and gives us a confidence boost.’

We end up buying T-shirt and a pastel-coloured bra which are both definitely at the acceptable end of the spectrum.

As I hand over my credit card, I am conscious of the vast video wall at the top of the stairs which is playing footage of the Victoria’s Secret runway shows — a clear reminder of the very adult world just steps away — and suppress an involuntary shudder.

I ask Elsa what she thinks of the store.

‘It’s like a girls’ dream world,’ she replies without hesitation.

‘Raunch culture’ or ‘dream world?’ As a parent, I know what I think, but as we leave behind queues of young girls waiting to pay at the tills, I am left with the distinct impression that in this debate, there is only one winner and her name is Victoria.
