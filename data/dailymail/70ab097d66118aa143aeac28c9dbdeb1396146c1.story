Phil Jagielka has admitted England are expecting no favours from Italy after Luis Suarez plunged them to the brink of World Cup elimination.

The Liverpool striker underwent knee surgery 28 days ago but he returned from injury to score twice, capitalising on defensive errors as Uruguay won 2-1 in Sao Paulo and leave Roy Hodgson needing a minor miracle for England to continue in the tournament.

England can still qualify for the knockout stages if Italy beat Costa Rica tomorrow and then follow up with victory against Uruguay next Tuesday; England would then need to beat Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte to save themselves.

But judging by the reaction of Jagielka and the rest of England’s players as they trudged off following a defeat that former manager Glenn Hoddle - speaking as a pundit on ITV - insisted was avoidable, it seems they have already accepted their fate.

Jagielka said: ‘It’s gutting, I think. We played so well again in spells but unfortunately if a little bit of luck had gone our way... if Steve (Gerrard) hadn’t ended up flicking the ball on, Suarez wouldn’t have been on side. You just hope that he miss-hits it but he finds the target and they win the game.’

When asked if Suarez was the difference, Jagielka replied: ‘The pass for the first goal was pretty decent. It was a similar story to the other night. We played pretty well at times but in the end we were not good enough.

Up against the best: Jagielka wins this battle with Suarez but England's defence twice conceded to him

Heads, you lose: Suarez comes out on the losing side of this aerial duel with the Everton centre back

‘It’s very disappointing. The last thing you want to see as a defender is a punt down the pitch and then a flick on and a goal. We are absolutely devastated in there. We had them on the back foot. We just couldn’t get the second goal.

‘There is a small chance I suppose (of Italy winning their next two games) but we are not exactly expecting anything like that to happen. We have got to go out there, put a good performance in and make sure we get something against Costa Rica.’

Double trouble: It wasn't just Suarez the England defence had to worry about, Edinson Cavani was there too
