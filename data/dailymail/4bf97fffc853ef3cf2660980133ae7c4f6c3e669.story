An Australian athlete suffered head injuries after a a drone which had been filming the race plummeted to the ground.

Raija Ogden was only metres from the finish line in the Endure Batavia Triathlon in Geraldton, Western Australia, on Sunday, when the incident happened.

She claims the drone hit her on the head and that an ambulance crew later found a piece of propeller embedded in her skull. She was taken to hospital where she needed three stitches.

The drone owner and operator Warren Abrams said Mrs Ogden was hurt when she fell over after being startled by the piece of equipment as it fell. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is investigating.

Hit by drone? Paramedics treat Raija Ogden after the crash at the Endure Batavia Triathlon in Geraldton, Western Australia

'My hair was completely red with blood.' Mrs Ogden told The Western Australian. 'I didn't hit the ground. I sat down because I just thought I was going to pass out.'

She vehemently denied that the injuries were caused when she fell over.

Warren Abrams, the pilot and drone owner from New Era Photography and Film, admitted that he had lost control of the drone before it fell 10 metres to the ground.

However, he claimed that this was because it had been hacked and that he had also lost control in an earlier test flight when someone 'channel hopped' and took it over. 

Mr Abrams believes any of the spectators or competitors could have easily used a smartphone to hack into the drones operating system.

He also claimed that footage from the flying camera would show that the device missed Ms Ogden and fell just behind her.

A number of witnesses have expressed varying views, supporting both versions of the event.

CASA is looking into the incident concerning the regulations for operating the drones, which dictate the minimum distance that unmanned aircraft must be flown is 30 metres away from people at all times.

The regulations relating to commercial unmanned aircraft clearly state that they 'require UAV controllerâ€™s certification and an operatorâ€™s certificate to fly.'

Allegations have also been raised over whether Mr Abrams or his company are certified to fly the cinematographic drones, with neither seeming to appear on the list of 92 nationally certified operators.

Drones, or unmanned aircraft , are best known for their military uses.

However, In recent years the technology is being utilised by photography groups, agricultural industries, advertising companies and in some cases for surveying purposes, according to CASA's list of operator certificate holders.

Hobbyists are also able to access devices, with affordable consumer options available on the market.
