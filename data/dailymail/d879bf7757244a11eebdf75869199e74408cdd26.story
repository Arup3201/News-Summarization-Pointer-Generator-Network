Nick Clegg was warned a second senior Lib Dem figure had made unwanted sexual advances to women – but did nothing about it, it was claimed last night.

The Deputy Prime Minister allegedly received a written complaint in March 2011 about the behaviour of Mike Hancock, MP for Portsmouth South, but did not reply.

The letter, from one of his constituents, said the MP ‘cannot be trusted and is a liability to women, the public, and your party’.

Yet despite this, no investigation was ever held, according to The Spectator magazine.

The letter was received months after Mr Hancock was arrested – but not charged – over allegations that he had made sexual advances on a constituent who had contacted him for help with a noisy neighbour.

The alleged victim is now suing the MP over what she said was a ten-month inappropriate relationship, during which he is accused of placing his hand on her breast, exposing himself and kissing her without consent.

A Lib Dem spokesman said last night: ‘If we’ve not replied to a letter, that’s not acceptable and we’ll look into why that happened. There was a police investigation into Mike Hancock but no action was subsequently taken.

‘There is currently a civil claim being made and it’s not appropriate to comment further.’

Three years ago Mr Hancock hit the headlines when his 25-year-old researcher was arrested – accused of being a Russian spy.

Previously: It was also revealed that a former councillor, John Thompson, sent a letter to then party leader Paddy Ashdown (pictured in March 1992) expressing concern about Hancock's behaviour in the 1990s

The father of two, 68, has admitted in a court case that he had had ‘a few’ extra-marital affairs and that he had ‘kissed and cuddled’ a teenager.

The Spectator also revealed that a former councillor, John Thompson, sent a letter to then party leader Paddy Ashdown expressing concern about Hancock’s behaviour in the 1990s. No response was received.

The party is already reeling from claims that the Lib Dem leadership turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual misconduct by former chief executive Lord Rennard.

However, in a remarkable display of confidence, the Lib Dem leader boasted that his party was ‘on the cusp of a great victory’ in Eastleigh, the seat vacated by disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne.

On a brief visit to the Hampshire town last night Mr Clegg told activists: ‘We can and we will win.’

His comments came despite signs that the Lib Dem/Tory marginal has turned into a dramatic three horse race following a late Ukip surge.

There are signs that the controversy surrounding the Rennard scandal may persuade some Lib Dem voters to stay at home today.

Defeat for Mr Clegg could hasten his departure as Lib Dem leader. But the consequences of a poor result for the Conservatives are also potentially serious for David Cameron.

Senior Tory David Davis warned that Cameron’s leadership would survive coming second to the Lib Dems but a good Ukip showing was ‘much more likely to have an impact on Tory MPs’.

Nick Clegg on Eastleigh by-election

Polls earlier in the week gave the Lib Dems a five-point lead over the Conservatives, with Ukip a strong third. But Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the polls had underestimated the late surge from his party.

Mr Farage said his candidate, Diane James, could even win tonight, saying: ‘We have a real possibility of  causing one of the most seismic  by-election results for decades.’

He added: ‘Cameron’s problem is that in this constituency hundreds of traditional Conservative voters have looked at his views on a range of things and decided he is not a Conservative.’

A poor result for Labour in Eastleigh would raise serious questions about its ability to win votes in the south of England.
