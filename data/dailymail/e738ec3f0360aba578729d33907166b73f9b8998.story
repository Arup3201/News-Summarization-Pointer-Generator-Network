We all know that it sometimes suits football's coaches and players to speak with forked tongue.

If you are exceptional at reading what's said, but dyslexic about what's between the lines, then you're in trouble.

However it may well be that when Joachim Low pin-pointed Germany's impending matches with Poland and Ireland as the most difficult he expected to face this season there was no subterfuge.

Germany manager Joachim Low poses with his medal after his World Cup win in July

A few days ago I was speaking to the club coach of one of Germany's World Cup-winning players and he admitted that the footballer had come to him not long before our chat to confess that he was mentally and physically shattered - that suddenly he ached all over.

Die Mannschaft is already missing central parts of their vorsprung machine - Phillip Lahm retired, new captain Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira injured.

Thus if others are going through the post-world cup blues and blisters then Herr Low has an interesting job of work on his hands.

His prognosis is: ‘For me, it is perfectly clear: the months leading up to the end of the year will be incredibly hard.

‘We have players who are tired, affected physically and who haven't recovered emotionally after the World Cup.

‘First of all, we have to take a step back, solidify ourselves and try to find the players who are in the best physical condition and are not battling against injuries.’

There's context. The last time Germany won the World Cup, under Der Kaiser Beckenbauer in 1990 their Autumn results included a 1-1 draw with Portugal and a remarkably narrow 3-2 win over Luxembourg.

More recently, Spain lost 4-0 to Portugal and 4-1 to Argentina in friendlies and squeaked past Scotland 3-2 in the months post Soccer City in 2014.

Beckenbauer isn't automatically a natural ally of Low's. Famously idiosyncratic in some of his declarations and decisions [recently banned by FIFA for failing to comply with their ethics investigator] Der Kaiser can, now, spark as much derision as respect for some of his football views.

Bayern Munich and Germany legend Philipp Lahm has retired from international duty

Bastian Schweinsteiger is yet to play this season due to injury

Sami Khedira is also currently sidelined with injury problems

He's taken several pot-shots at Pep Guardiola's Bayern for example.

Pre-Brazil, in fact, Beckenbauer admitted he thought winning the tournament was beyond Löw's Mannschaft and that a semi-final appearance, plus positive publicity for the Bundesliga, would be an acceptable product from a tournament in which German football normally regards domination as a birthright.

Yet his choice of phrases nicely reflects the predominant zeitgeist in Germany. Purring with pride at being the world's number one again, and content with the velvet football which Low's team can lay on at will. But still looking for a bit more of that iron fist. Not just the Joachim Low way. The German way.

According to Beckenbauer: ‘In aesthetic terms Germany has never played so well. Joachim Low has done a wonderful job and has transformed German football culture so that we now play a much more seductively. We have exceptional attacking power - never better.

‘However the important thing always is to retain our combative mentality. Players must be prepared to sacrifice themselves. They should be ready to put up with a bit of pain. 

'It's absolutely wonderful to have such technically gifted players but I worry that some of our them are too fragile physically. ‘A few fall over at the slightest contact and they´re immediately looking for the referee.’

Beckenbauer and Low are the only two living men to have lifted football's greatest prize as German coach.

Obviously, in terms of playing pedigree, trophies and even managerial pedigree they are ill-matched. The all-time thoroughbred and the whole-grain brown bread.

And the German legend remains an influential figure presiding over  football in the country

Although Low has the air of the maverick his squad atmosphere is high-tech, calm, modern. Controlled.

The fact that Germany now face Poland is, for some of us, a throwback to the 1974 World Cup when the Poles' greatest ever side, Lato, Gorgoń, Deyna, Kasperczak and Gadocha, were narrowly beaten (14 minutes from time, Gerd Muller) in the quarter-final.

Compared to the rigid discipline and immense strategic planning of Löw's victorious era, Der Kaiser recalls his first World Cup win as a harum-scarum, riotous affair.

He admits: ‘We got up to all sorts in my day but nobody found out . There was no social media back then. I remember we trained for the that World Cup in Malente, (Northern Germany) and we were bored rigid. I used my status as captain to persuade the local police to escort me into the town without anyone finding out. "I couldn't possibly tell you what I got up to of course...

There was a dispute about our bonus payment system and, as captain I warned the federation that we players were prepared to stop training and even refuse to go to the World Cup if they didn't meet our demands. "We managed to find a compromise position in the end but things were very tense between us and Helmut Schön, the coach.

‘We certainly didn't start the competition in the best situation but we were all in warrior mode, particularly against Holland, so we ended up winning. I remember my pep talk to my team mates before the final. I said: “Just one more big push and we'll make history and our country proud”.

‘Even as I said it though, I knew that nobody was listening. They were all thinking about the game.’

However, just to continue the theme there was a post World Cup dip 40 years ago too. Missing several stars from the final, injured or retired, West Germany's handful of matches post winning in Munich against Johan Cruyff's Holland included draws with Greece and Bulgaria, defeat to England and a narrow 1-0 win over Malta. Embarrassing for the Germans, schadenfreude for everyone else.

So, the message is clear. For Mario Götze, Manuel Neuer, Mesut Özil and co. - beware the ides of October.
