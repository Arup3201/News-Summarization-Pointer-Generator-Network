The teenage grandson of former presidential candidate Ron Paul was arrested last night at Charlotte Douglas International Airport and charged with disorderly conduct and being intoxicated and disruptive.

Deputies at the airport said that William Hilton Paul, 19, identified himself a member of the political family and as the son of U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, but said that they did not know where he got the alcohol or if anyone at the airport had served him.

The teenager who is currently a student of the University of Kentucky was taken in by deputies of the Mecklenburh County Sheriff's Office to be booked and is scheduled to appear in court on January 8th.

Moira Bagley, communications director for Senator Paul released the following statement on Sunday afternoon:

'Senator Paul is a national public figure and subject to scrutiny in the public arena, however, as many parents with teenagers would understand, his family should be afforded the privacy and respect they deserve in a situation such as this.'

Police said William Hilton Paul, 19, was traveling early Saturday from Lexington, Ky., to Charlotte.

When the US Airways flight landed around 10:49 a.m., Paul was charged with consuming beer/wine underage, disorderly conduct and being intoxicated and disruptive.

'He was possibly served alcohol on the flight,' Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Lieutenant Blake Hollar said.

The arrest comes at an embarrassing time for Senator Paul after he dropped a hint over the weekend that he might contemplate a run for the presidency in 2016.

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) attends the Republican National Convention at the Tampa Bay Times Forum on August 28, 2012 in Tampa, Florida - he has refused to rule out a tilt at the presidency in 2016

Appearing as a guest on the nationally syndicated radio program 'The Andrea Tantaros Show with Jason Mattera', the senator suggested his libertarian approach is what the Republican party needs to get re-elected to the White House.

Asked if he personally was thinking about a run for president, Paul said: 'The Republican Pary, in order to grow and win national elections again, we are going to have to have somebody a little bit different than we've had in the past.

'Someone who can appeal to people in New England and on the West Coast. Someone who has a little more of a libertarian-Republican approach, I think, would have a better chance with independents and moderates.

'And so, we'll think about it.'

The radio host interrupted, 'Are you going to run? Are you thinking about running?'

'We'll have to wait and see,' replied Paul. 'I haven't said no, and I haven't also said yes.'
