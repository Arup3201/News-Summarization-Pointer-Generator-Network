Jeremy Forrest regularly exchanged text and online messages with girl pupils at his previous school and sent them birthday cards, it emerged yesterday.

The married 30-year-old was said to prefer the company of pupils to fellow teachers and treated them like his ‘little sisters’.

One pupil said on Twitter: ‘The guy used to give me a birthday card every year, he never forgot! Now I think he just wanted to take me to France.’

Another, who is now 19, admitted she was his favourite and he would treat her ‘like a little sister’ encouraging her to take up singing and discover new bands.

Once he even went to watch her sing at a competition out of school hours and encouraged her to sing songs by his favourite band, Nirvana, and wept at a farewell meal for his class.

In an echo of his relationship with Megan Stammers, he sat on a plane next to the girl on a school trip, though she insists that he was not trying to groom her.

Meanwhile, Forrest’s family have insisted that his decision to flee to France on a cross-Channel ferry with his pupil last week was completely out of character.

They claim it was due to a deterioration in his mental health and he is depressed.

But his behaviour at Bishop Justus School in Bromley, Kent, where he worked until July 2009, raises disturbing questions in light of what he has now done.

One former pupil, who was in Forrest’s tutor group for four years between 11 and 16, described how he used to text her in his spare time, send her online messages and treat her like his ‘favourite’.

The former pupil, who is now aged 19, said: ‘He was very shy but seemed more comfortable around his students. He was more outgoing around us.

'On his lunch breaks he would stay in his room and listen to music or help the children who were struggling.

‘He didn’t go to the staff room very much with the other teachers, he kept himself to himself.’

But she said she didn’t think Mr Forrest was ‘grooming’ her for a relationship in any way and insists his behaviour was innocent, and he was never inappropriate towards her.

‘He was just friendly and always offering his help. Not just to me, but to others too,’ she said.

‘Everyone at the school respected him, teachers and pupils. The naughty kids were all put into his class because he was the only one who could handle them.

‘We’d all go on his blog and listen to his music – it was weird seeing your teacher like that. Some of my friends fancied him – but he’s not my type.

‘What’s happened is a surprise because he would always post pictures on Facebook of his wife. He seemed really proud of her. He said he’d invite me to the wedding but I never got an invite.’

The teenager went on a geography and history school trip to Italy with Forrest, where they got to know each other well and became good friends, sitting next to each other on the plane.

He also attended the pupil’s end-of-year ball and organised a dinner out for his tutor group after he left, where she said he became was tearful about leaving.

She added: ‘Friends are being really mean about him on Twitter, calling him a paedo and stuff, but I don’t think it’s fair. I think he must have really loved this girl to go off with her.’

The girl’s mother agreed that she never suspected anything of Forrest. ‘We met his whole family, they were lovely,’ she said.

‘We honestly couldn’t say a bad word about him – you couldn’t have asked for a nicer man. We are totally shocked.’

Another former pupil of Forrest, said on Twitter: ‘I’m sad his (sic) gone, now I’m going to miss the birthday cards every year, the chats we had.’

She later added: ‘The guy used to give me a birthday card every year, he never forgot! Now I think he just wanted to take me to France.’

Other pupils tweeted that they are not concerned about Megan’s safety because she is with Forrest and he will ‘keep her safe’.

On Twitter, a girl who describes herself as one of Megan’s ‘best friends’ responded to posts about her being in danger. On Saturday she tweeted: ‘He’ll keep her safe.’

Another friend responded: ‘At least there (sic) happy.’

However, one pupil pointed out: ‘They may be happy but think about megan’s family. He needs to just bring her back.’

Jeremy’s father, Jim Forrest, who runs an IT business, also defended his son, saying that he was not a ‘violent or evil’ person.

He said: ‘We have been worried about him for some time and noticed him going further downhill for more than – let’s just say – a matter of months. He’d been in a bad state for a long time.

‘So we don’t understand why the school didn’t step in and do anything. We are very disappointed.’
