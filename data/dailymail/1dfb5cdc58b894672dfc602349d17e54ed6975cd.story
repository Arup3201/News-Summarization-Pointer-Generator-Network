Diplomats in Libya knew the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was a terrorist attack 'from the get-go,' the number-two American official in the country will testify this week. 

The revelation by Gregory Hicks, the deputy chief of mission in Libya, shows that the Obama Administration knew the the September 11, 2012 attack was not the result of a popular protest over an anti-Islamic YouTube video - as the American public was initially told.

Hicks is one of three State Department 'whistle blowers' expected to appear in front of the House Oversight Committee Wednesday to give evidence of a 'coverup' by the Obama administration over its response to the attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. 

The combined testimony is likely to 
re-ignite criticism of the Obama 
Administration's handling of the run-up to the Benghazi attacks and its 
handling of the aftermath.

Witness: Gregory N. Hicks, a veteran officer of the Foreign Service - was in Tripoli on the night of the attack when he received a distress call from Ambassador Stevens

Tragic: The September 11, 2012, assault on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

'Cover-up': Congressman Darrell Issa, the Republican in charge of the Benghazi attack hearings, says the testimony from the whistle blowers could reveal an Obama Administration 'cover-up'

'I thought it was a terrorist attack from the get-go. I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning,' Hicks said, according to excerpts of interviews released to CBS' Face the Nation.

Hicks, a 22-year veteran of the foreign service, says he was furious when U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on TV five days after the attack and declared that U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans died as part of an anti-American 'demonstration' by Libyans.

'I've never been as embarrassed in my life, in my career, as on that day,' he told Congressional interviewers.

He added: 'I never reported a demonstration. I reported an attack on the consulate. Chris's last report - if you want to say his final report - is, "Greg, we are under attack."'

Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz, a 
Republican and members of the House committee, said told Fox News that Hicks was in Tripoli on the night of 
the attack when he received a distress call from Ambassador Stevens.

Eric Nordstrom, who was the regional security officer in Libya, also testified on Capitol Hill on October 10

Mourned: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith were both killed inside the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya

Defenders: Glen Doherty, left, and Tyrone Woods, right, were former Navy seamen who responded to the call for help from the consulate and were killed in a counter-attack by the terrorists

'We're under attacks! We're under attacks' Stevens reportedly yelled into his cell phone.

According
to the Utah congressman, Hicks reacted to the news by calling 
Washington to alert officials and set off an 'inter-agency response.'

Another witness of the attacks, Mark I. Thompson, a U.S. Marine veteran and a State Department counter-terrorism adviser, plans to testify that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to leave her department's own counter-terrorism bureau out of
the loop as government in the hours after the attacks as officials figured out how to respond to the attacks.

The third witness is Eric Nordstrom, a former State Department diplomatic security officer in charge of regional security in Libya.

Allegation: One of the Benghazi 'whistle-blowers' will reportedly claim on Wednesday that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to silence the State Department's own counterterrorism bureau

'Clearly, there was a political decision to say something different than what was reasonable to say,' House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa told Face the Nation.

He said State Department and White House officials launched 'what is a misinformation campaign, at best, and a cover-up at worst.'

Two major targets of the Republican-controlled investigation are Clinton and Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy.

Spokespeople for both the state department and Clinton denied the allegations.

For Nordstrom, the upcoming hearing would not be the first time that he was called to testify on the events of last September.

'For
me the Taliban is on the inside of the [State Department] building,' 
the former mission deputy chief angrily said while speaking at a hearing
chaired by California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa in October 2012.  

Co-worker: The claims will reportedly also finger Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy

During
his testimony at the time, Nordstrom detailed for lawmakers how he and 
the late ambassador had repeatedly asked to increase security at the 
embassy in the months leading up to the attack, but said that their 
pleas fell on deaf ears as the situation in the country continued 
deteriorating.

The two other State Department officials have never publicly spoken about the attacks.

Hicks and Thompson are believed to be
represented pro bono by Joe diGenova, a former US attorney, and his 
wife, Victoria Toensing, a former chief counsel of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee.

Of the three men, Nordstrom is the only one who does not consider himself a whistle-blower.

According
to diGenova and Toensing, their clients' accounts of the attacks in 
Benghazi were dismissed by then-Secretary Hillary Clinton's 
Accountability Review Board, and the two civil servants have been 
subjected to an intimidation campaign by their superiors meant to stop 
them from telling the truth about the tragic events in Libya.
