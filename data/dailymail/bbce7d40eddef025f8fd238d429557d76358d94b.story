Richard Griffiths has died at the age of 65, it was announced today.

The famed theatrical, television and film actor died yesterday after suffering complications related to heart surgery at the University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire.

He starred in Alan Bennett's play The History Boys and appeared in cult classic Withnail and I as the comic Uncle Monty, after getting his start with a small role in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi - but he found a new audience of fans as Vernon Dursley in the Harry Potter films.

Daniel Radcliffe, who played the title role in Harry Potter and also performed with Griffiths in the play Equus, led tributes to the actor, as Withnail star Richard E. Grant said: 'Chin chin dear friend.'

'Richard was by my side during two of the most important moments of my career,' he said.

'In August 2000, before official 
production had even begun on Potter, we filmed a shot outside the 
Dursleys', which was my first ever shot as Harry. I was nervous and he 
made me feel at ease.

'Seven years later, we embarked on 
Equus together. It was my first time doing a play but, terrified as I 
was, his encouragement, tutelage and humour made it a joy.

'In fact, any room he walked into was
 made twice as funny and twice as clever just by his presence. I am 
proud to say I knew him.'

Richard E. Grant tweeted: 'My beloved "Uncle Monty" Richard Griffiths died last night. Chin-Chin my dear friend.'

Withnail co-star Paul McGann added his condolences, writing: 'A mighty tree has fallen. Heart goes out to his family and loved ones.

'A brilliant, funny, principled man, and a true gent. Led the way on 
Withnail and I. Wore his great skill lightly and his great heart out.'

Beloved: Griffiths played the lead role of Harry Crabbe in popular BBC1 series Pie in the Sky

Many of Griffiths' fellow actors took to Twitter to pay tribute to him.

Russell Tovey, who appeared alongside him in The History Boys and went on to star in Being Human, wrote: 'Really sad.

'Our mate and leader has moved on to 
the theatre in the sky. We will miss you so much Richard Griffiths... 
RIP you wonderful man.'

John Simm, from Life on Mars and Doctor Who, added: 'RIP the mighty Richard Griffiths. Very sad news indeed.'

Director Trevor Nunn said: 'Richard was an instinctive comic genius, and like a very few genius comedians of the past, he also became an actor of rare emotional and indeed tragic power.

'Richard inspired great love and spread much happiness, and as the Shakespeare he loved put it, "There's a great spirit gone."'

In 2005, Griffiths won the Olivier award for
 best actor for his performance as Mr Hector in The History Boys, a play
 set in a 1980s Yorkshire grammar school which was later turned into a 
film also starring Griffiths and directed by Nicholas Hytner.

After the play transferred to Broadway, Griffiths added a much-coveted Tony award.

He was already known to the British public for playing the lead role of Henry Crabbe in Pie in the Sky, a police drama broadcast on BBC1 from 1994 to 1997.

Griffiths was awarded the OBE for services to drama in the New Year's Honours 2008.

He married Heather Gibson in 1980 after they met during a production of Lady Windermere's Fan in 1973. The couple lived in the village of Bearley, near Stratford-upon-Avon, and  had no children.

The exact circumstances of Griffiths' death are unclear, and it is not known whether the operation was intended to address a long-term heart condition.

The portly actor, whose weight problem 
was blamed on medication he took as a child, played many starring roles 
on television and in the West End.

Sir Nicholas Hytner, director of the National Theatre, said Griffiths's unexpected death would devastate his 'army of friends'.

'Richard Griffiths wasn't only one of
 the most loved and recognisable British actors - he was also one of the
 very greatest,' he said.

'His
 performance in The History Boys was quite overwhelming: a masterpiece 
of wit, delicacy, mischief and desolation, often simultaneously.

'But
 that was just one small part of a career that spanned Shakespeare, 
cutting-edge new plays and major work in film and television.'

Sir
 Nicholas, who directed Griffiths in The History Boys and The Habit Of 
Art, added: 'His currency as an actor was truth; as a colleague it was 
hilarity.

'His 
anecdotes were legendary. They were, literally, endless. They would go 
on for hours, apparently without destination, constantly side-splitting.

'The
 only way to stop them was to tell him you were walking away, though 
there were always others in the audience so, as far as I know, he never 
stopped. He was the life of every party.'

Griffiths was well-known as an actor 
who took a strong line against members of theatre audiences whose mobile
 telephones rang out during performances.

At least twice, he was known to have stopped a show to order people out of the theatre after their phones had persistently rung.

Tributes: Other actors and media figures took to Twitter to express their condolences at Griffiths' death

He
 was born on July 31 1947 in Thornaby-on-Tees, the son of a steelworker.
 His parents were both deaf and he learned sign language at an early age
 so he could communicate with them.

Griffiths developed an ear for dialects which subsequently landed him with several diverse roles.

In
 his childhood, he attempted to run away from home many times. He 
dropped out of school at the age of 15 and worked as a porter, but his boss convinced him to go back to school. He decided to 
attend a drama class at Stockton and Billingham College, then moved on to Manchester Polytechnic School of Drama.

Subsequently
 Griffiths earned a spot on BBC radio and worked in small theatres as an
 actor and manager. But he built up a reputation as a Shakespearean 
'clown' with hilarious portrayals of characters such as Falstaff with 
the Royal Shakespeare Company.

After settling in Manchester, 
he began to get lead roles in plays and on television. His first big 
break was in 1976 film It Shouldn't Happen To A Vet, followed by roles 
in contemporary and period pieces such as Gorky Park, Withnail And I, 
The Smell Of Fear, Guarding Tess and Sleepy Hollow.

In 2006, he starred with Daniel Radcliffe in a stage revival of Peter Shaffer's Equus at the Gielgud Theatre in London.

Last year he appeared alongside Hollywood actor Danny DeVito in The Sunshine Boys in the West End.

His agent Simon Beresford said: 'Richard brightened my days and enriched the life of anyone he came into contact with.

'On stage he allowed us to share in our own humanity and constantly question our differences.

'Richard
 gave acting a good name. He was a remarkable man and one of our 
greatest and best-loved actors. He will be greatly missed.

'Our thoughts and deepest sympathy go to his devoted wife Heather and his family at this sad time.'

Thea Sharrock, who directed 
Griffiths in Equus, Heroes and Sunshine Boys, said: 'I worked with 
Richard more times than any other actor.

'Everybody knew he was my favourite. He was the most tender, gentle, kind, generous, loving man.

'His
 curiosity was unending, as was his striving for perfection. I cannot 
imagine a world without all those stories. I will miss him so very very 
much.'

The producers of
 Heroes and Equus, David Pugh and Dafydd Rogers, described the actor as a
 'great man, a great character, a great talent greatly missed'.

In a joint statement they said: 'He was a glorious man and we were so honoured to have known him.'
