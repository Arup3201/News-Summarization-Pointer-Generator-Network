President Barack Obama used an executive order today to impose new sanctions on North Korea today over its 'destructive, coercive cyber-related actions,' including a hack on computers Sony last month.

The sanctions affect three state-controlled North Korean companies and 10 of its government officials, the Associated Press reports.

Obama, still on vacation in Hawaii, notified Congress of his actions in a letter this afternoon.

At a press conference the day he departed for his annual holiday in the Hawaiian islands, President Barack Obama promised a 'proportional and appropriate' response to North Korea's hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. Today he levied sanctions on the foreign government and 10 of its officials

Obama promised at a press conference last month before departing for his annual holiday in the Hawaiian islands that he would take 'proportional and appropriate' actions to punish North Korea for its attack on Sony's computers.

Obama would not say whether sanctions were under consideration at that time or detail other possible retaliatory measures the U.S. might take against North Korea such as a cyber hack of its own, just that he was considering 'a range of options.'

'They caused a lot of damage, and we will respond,' he said. 'We will respond proportionally, and we’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. 

'It’s not something that I will announce here today at a press conference,' he added. 

Days later North Korea began experiencing massive, repeated internet outages. The State Department did not take credit for internet disruptions, which are believed to be the result of a hack, but it left the possibility open that the U.S. could be involved.

A spokesman for the National Defense Commission, North Korea's military arm, later insisted that the U.S. was behind the country's internet failures and slurred Obama.

'Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest,' an unnamed official told the country's state-run Korean Central News Agency.

Today's sanctions are the first government acknowledged actions against North Korea for hack on Sony's computers and related threats of violence against movie theaters that showed a James Franco Seth Rogan comedy film depicting the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

'As the President has said, our response to North Korea's attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment will be proportional, and will take place at a time and in a manner of our choosing,' the White House said in a statement.

'Today's actions are the first aspect of our response.' 

Obama told Members of Congress in a letter, 'I have now determined that that the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014...and commission of serious human rights abuses, constitute a continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.' 

He noted that his executive order 'is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the Government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others.'

The new sanctions build off of previous penalties levied on the foreign government by Obama in 2008, 2010 and 2011.

Per AP, sanctions were directed at Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's primary intelligence organization, Korea Mining and Development Trading Corporation (KOMID), the state's arms dealer and Korea Tangun Trading Corporation, defense research organization.

North Korean officials named include KOMID representatives to Russia, Iran and Syria and the business' external affair officers, as well as a Korea Tangun Trading Corporation representative who operates out of Shenyang, China.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions were 'driven by our commitment to hold North Korea accountable for its destructive and destabilizing conduct.

'Even as the FBI continues its investigation into the cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend U.S. businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States,' he said today.

Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Obama administration's decision 'sends a message to North Korea and others that the United States will not tolerate illicit activities, including cyber attacks.'

'It’s time to acknowledge that our current North Korea policy is not working, and that we must develop a more proactive strategy across the board to respond to growing threats from North Korea, including its cyber activities as well as its weapons of mass destruction programs,' the Tennessee lawmaker said.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce also said he did not think the penalties on North Korea were stiff enough.

'It’s good to see the Administration challenging North Korea’s latest aggression - cyberattacks that can do grave damage. But many of the North Koreans blacklisted today have already been targeted by U.S. sanctions,' the California Republican said.

'We need to go further to sanction those financial institutions in Asia and beyond that are supporting the brutal and dangerous North Korean regime, as was done in 2005. 

'My comprehensive legislation that the House passed last year would give the Administration the tools to do just that,' he said.

The White House has said several times since the Sony hack that it would like to see Congress pass new cyber security legislation and it would support those efforts.
