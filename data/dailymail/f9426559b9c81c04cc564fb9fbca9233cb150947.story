Chris Evans, seen here playing in a previous Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, has been banned for taking part in future events

Radio DJ Chris Evans has been 'barred for life' from golf’s most glamorous celebrity tournament – after apparently giving himself too generous a handicap to help him win last year's tournament.

The broadcaster won the Alfred 
Dunhill Links Championship last October with professional playing 
partner Nick Dougherty but their 40-under par performance over four rounds raised 
eyebrows.

And now three months before he was due 
to defend the title he won last year, it has emerged that he will not be
allowed to defend his title.

Evans, 46, and event organisers refused to fully explain why he has been banned but it emerged last night that it may be the result of Evans’s handicap for last year.

His handicap was 10 - meaning he can take ten shots off his actual score to give a 'net score' that counts towards the final result - and he claimed after the win that he was given the impression organisers believed it was too high to reflect his ability.

Those who saw him play suggested that he should not have been allowed so many shots.

Evans said this weekend: ‘Sadly, I will not be defending my title this year. Why? It transpires I’ve been barred for life.

‘I could go into why but frankly it’s all a bit of a bore. Suffice to say, if we were kids in the playground, the boy who owns the ball just took it home in a huff because his team didn’t win.’

The annual event pro-am event sees teams of one professional and one celebrity playing rounds at each of the Old Course at St Andrews, the Championship course at Carnoustie and world-class Kingsbarns, in Fife.

Celebrities such as actors Michael Douglas, Hugh Grant and Samuel L Jackson regularly participate in the Scottish event.

And yesterday, Evans was still featuring on the tournament’s website - and talking with delight about the victory.

This time last year, writing in his column in the Mail On Sunday’s Live magazine, the broadcaster revealed there had been ‘rumblings of dissent’.

He wrote: ‘Along with congratulations, there were rumblings of dissent. The gloaming was dark with talk of my handicap being too high for my ability.’

Chris Evans play in the tournament off a handicap of ten, meaning he expects to go round a golf course in ten shots over par.

In the Alfred Dunhill tournament the team score for each hole is the lower score of each pair, with the handicap taken into consideration.

As the pairings are made up of one amateur and one professional, the amateurs receive a stroke allowance equal to two thirds of their handicap, suggesting Evans normally plays off 15.

For the tournament he would have been given one shot on the course's ten hardest holes (those given a stroke index 1 to 10) each round - or a total of 40 over the whole tournament.

So on a par 5, Evans and Dougherty might have both taken four shots, but if it was recognised as one of the six hardest holes, Evans' score would be a net three - or two under par for the hole.

This is how they were able to run up net scores of 66, 57, 64 and 61 (against par of 72) for a total of 40-under pair, leaving organisers suggesting that a handicap allowing Evans 24 shots was a little generous.

But he is not alone, suspect high handicaps are the subject of much debate in golf clubs around the country.

Players who claim to have a higher handicap than their ability suggests are branded 'bandits'.

     The broadcaster also revealed he was 
the butt of jokes and asked: ‘Where did you get your handicap? Mexico’ 
and ‘Where did you leave your sombrero?’

‘They were references to my 'bandit' status,’ he added.

Evans
went on: ‘OK, so we finished 40 under par, which I’ve never heard of 
before, but that was combination of mine and Nick’s best score on each 
hole.

‘And when you consider the leading professional finished 22 under, I don’t think that’s entirely incredible.’

But Evans’s banishment has still come as a ‘shock’ because he had booked his holidays to coincide with this year’s tournament.

The former TFI Friday star said: ‘Because of Radio 2’s complicated schedules I have to book my holidays a year in advance. So I now have two weeks in October and nowhere to go.’

In spite of the ban, the broadcaster kept joking, suggesting he is considering setting up a rival competition for his golfing and celebrity pals.

He said:  ‘Any sour grapes? Not really. But it crossed my mind to set up an alternative tournament on the exact same dates.

‘I think I’ll call it the Dung Hill Cup.’

A spokesman for the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship said: ‘We have no comment to make.’And a spokesman for the European Tour added: ‘ We have no involvement in the celebrity invitations for this tournament.’
