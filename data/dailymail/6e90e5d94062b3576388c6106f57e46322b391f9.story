Drugs death: Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, of Croydon, south London, died on Monday afternoon after allegedly taking ecstasy at an illegal rave in Hayes

The grieving mother of a teenage ecstasy victim told yesterday of the heartbreaking final promise he made to her.

Daniel Spargo-Mabbs told his devoted Christian parents he was going to a party after school and assured his anxious mother as he left: ‘I love you, Mum. I promise I won’t die.’ 

They were the last words he ever said to her. The next time his parents saw him he was in intensive care after taking ecstasy for the first time at an illegal rave. 

The 16-year-old had suffered a massive heart attack and died two days later.

Today police said two men, Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, of Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, of Beckenham, have been charged with supplying Class A drugs.

The charges came as the schoolboy’s devastated parents spoke of their grief at his death from the class A drug which claims 31 lives a year.

His Oxford-educated mother Fiona, 46, who works as a manager in adult education at Croydon Council, said Daniel had never taken drugs before and had been lectured by his parents and school about the scourge of ecstasy.

On Friday night the bright student, who attended Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England School in Croydon, which is known for its high academic standards, persuaded his mother to let him go to a party in Clapham, south London, saying: ‘Come on, Mum, I hardly ever go to parties and I am sensible and responsible.’

But instead of the party he went to an illegal rave on an industrial estate in Hayes, west London.

Final words: The schoolboy, pictured left, told his mother, pictured right, 'I love you, I promise I won't die' as he left home on Friday night - just hours before he was taken to hospital suffering from a drugs overdose

In a warehouse, owned
 by a commercial cleaning firm and said to be packed with 3,000 
revellers, his parents believe he experimented with ecstasy for the 
first time.

Shortly 
afterwards the youngster collapsed and was taken to hospital. His 
reaction to the drug sent his temperature rocketing to 42C (107.6F), 
causing a massive heart attack.

Mrs Spargo-Mabbs recalled yesterday how she had kissed her son goodbye for the last time hours before he took the substance.

‘A
 few years ago I heard a talk by murder victim Jimmy Mizen’s mum and she
 said that something that comforted her was that she had told Jimmy she 
loved him and had given him a hug and a kiss before he had left the 
house,’ she said.

Aid: Daniel was taken to hospital on Saturday believed to be suffering from the effects of a drugs overdose

‘After that I always did the same 
with my boys and it became an in-joke. Danny always used to say “I love 
you too, Mum. I promise I won’t die.”

‘And that’s exactly what he said when he went out on Friday. He didn’t keep that promise.’

Speaking
 at the family’s home in Croydon, south London, which she shares with 
her husband Tim, 50, and son Jacob, 18, she added: ‘I  woke up early on 
Saturday morning and when I saw he wasn’t back I started to worry.

‘Then at about 5.30am there was a knock on the door. It was the police. It was completely my worst nightmare coming true.’

The
 family rushed to Hillingdon Hospital where Daniel was in intensive 
care. He was transferred to a specialist liver unit at King’s College 
Hospital for emergency surgery but he died on Monday.

Place of education: Daniel was a pupil at Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School in Croydon

Yesterday
 Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said her son, who was studying for his AS levels 
having achieved a number of A* and A grades in GCSE exams last year, had
 ambitions to join the Army or become an English teacher.

'We grieve together': Daniel was praised by his headteacher as a 'bright, articulate and talented' boy

The keen sportsman and musician was described as ‘hugely popular’ with his peers.

A
 committed Christian, Daniel ran errands for pensioners as part of his 
local paper round and helped to run a children’s group at Emmanuel 
Church in Croydon, where his father sometimes leads services.

The schoolboy, who had a long-term girlfriend, was due to start the Alpha course, an evangelical teaching scheme, this week.

Although
 he had ‘an adventurous spirit’, Mrs Spargo-Mabbs insisted: ‘Daniel had 
never taken drugs before. It is not the kind of thing he did.

‘I want people to know that’s not who he is. He knew all the risks because I told him and the school told him.

‘He was one in the however [many] millions – whatever the statistic is – that was unlucky.

‘And
 he knew the risks because he quoted those statistics at me a few months
 ago … If he said he had been going to a rave I wouldn’t have let him 
go.

'That’s why he told me a fib. But what 16-year-old hasn’t told a fib 
to their mum?’

She added: ‘My boys are the loveliest boys in the whole world. I just don’t know how I am going to go on.

‘Daniel
 was so full of life and I don’t understand how he can be gone.’

Her 
heartbroken husband Tim, a learning disability charity worker, said the 
youngster was ‘a lovely mercurial kid’, adding: ‘He wasn’t only my son, 
he was my friend too.

Deaths involving ecstasy have increased almost four-fold in recent years.

In 2012 there were 31 deaths linked to the class A drug, up from eight in 2010.

There was also a large increase in the number of death certificates mentioning PMA or PMMA, strong psychedelic stimulants usually found in ecstasy pills.

The substances, which can cause severe overheating of the body, were linked to only one death in 2011, but in 2012 they were involved in 20 fatalities.

Campaigners believe many people may be ingesting PMA or PMMA in the belief they are taking ecstasy tablets.

According to government estimates, around 2.8million Britons have tried ecstasy at least once and 179,000 people take it at least once a month.

It is usually sold as tablets but the powder form, MDMA, has become more common.

‘This
 was the first time he’d taken anything and if it could happen to him it
 could happen to anyone.’

Yesterday Daniel’s tearful grandmother, 
Sheila, said she hoped the people who gave him the drugs would be 
punished.

‘It was the first
 time Daniel had ever been to something like this, and I would guess the
 first time he’d ever taken anything like that,’ she said.

‘Daniel was with friends but not his usual friends, as I understand it. I suppose he just wanted to be one of the boys.

‘He
 was hardworking at school and very sensible, which is why I’m so 
shocked at what’s happened.

'He’s the last person I’d expect this to 
happen to, he wasn’t in with a bad sort of crowd.

‘I just hope they string up  whoever it is that gave the drugs to him.’

Yesterday,
 the youngster’s headmaster, Richard Parrish, wrote a letter to parents,
 saying: ‘Our heart goes out to Daniel’s family, to his parents, to his 
brother Jacob and to his closest friends.

‘To
 them we want to say the same as we are saying to ourselves: that what 
has happened to Daniel is not normal.

'It is not normal that a bright, 
articulate, talented 16/17-year-old should be taken from us in this 
way.’

Last night the 
Reverend Bridget Shepherd, of Emmanuel Church, held prayers for the 
schoolboy and said the community was ‘deeply saddened’ by his death.
