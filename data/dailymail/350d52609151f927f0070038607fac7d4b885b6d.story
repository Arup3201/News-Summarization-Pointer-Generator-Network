Home invasion: Louis Steyn (pictured) was tied up, tortured and robbed by a gang after they burst into his property and threw a house party while he was watching TV

A terrified homeowner was tied up, tortured and robbed by a vicious gang after they burst into his home and threw an impromptu house party.

Louis Steyn, 42, was watching TV when three men and two women including a former trainee teacher invaded his property poured themselves drinks and pumped up the volume on a music channel - shouting: 'The party's here!'

When Mr Steyn protested, they gagged him, tied his hands and feet together before beating him up and subjecting him to 'gratuitous degradation.'

The victim feared for his life during his horrific ordeal and pleaded with one of his tormentors not to stab him as a six-inch boning knife was held threateningly in front of his face.

Eventually, the gang ransacked Mr Steyn's home in quiet cul-de-sac in Burnley, Lancs, grabbing laptops, computers and televisions before stuffing them into his Audi A4 and driving off into the night.

Mr Steyn managed to get to his feet and call the police and an officer found him with his hands still tied.

He was treated in hospital, where he had nine stitches to eye injuries. He also had other cuts to his face, a swollen lip and bruises and marks to his wrists and legs.

Details of his ordeal emerged as the gang were jailed for over 27 years after admitting robbery. David Steer, 26, of no fixed abode and John Williams, 20, of Burnley were each jailed for seven years four months.

Zac Ward, 25, of Radcliffe, Manchester was jailed for seven years. Mother of one Sally Brennand, 19, of no fixed abode who once had a place on a teaching apprenticeship was jailed for three years four months and Rebecca Greenough, 18, of Burnley was jailed for two years ten months. Steer also admitted aggravated vehicle taking.

Burnley Crown Court was told Mr Steyn's ordeal began at 7.30pm on October 25 last year when Williams knocked on his door, asking if he could 'come in for a drink.'

The victim answered the door and told him to go but Steer then appeared and both barged their way inside accompanied by their three accomplices.

'All five defendants made themselves comfortable in the lounge,' said Miss Amanda Johnson, prosecuting.

'One produced a bottle of alcohol, drinks were poured, the TV was turned on to a music channel and the volume was turned up.

'Mr Steyn repeatedly asked the group to leave, but to no avail.'

Williams went into the kitchen, got some vodka from the fridge and all five carried on drinking. At about 8.30pm, Williams and Ward went into the kitchen and were heard whispering and seen to put their coats on.

Mr Steyn thought they were leaving but instead Steer suddenly punched him in the face, knocking him to the floor and hitting and kicking him.

Miss Johnson said: 'The victim was covering his face and head with his arms and was unable to make out what was being said. Steer began to demand Mr Steyn's car keys and the victim said they were upstairs.

'Williams and Steer then dragged Mr Steyn upstairs, the keys couldn't be find and he was dragged back downstairs again. One defendant found the keys and Mr Steyn was ordered to kneel down and put his hands behind his head, which he did.

'One of the women started putting his DVDs in a bin bag. Williams then appeared in front of the victim, holding a six inch boning knife in front of his face in a threatening manner.

'Mr Steyn was terrified and pleading "Please don't stab me, take what you want." Others were ransacking the house and gathering up computer equipment, monitors, DVDs and other electrical items, which were being loaded into the Audi.

Sent down: David Steer, 26, of no fixed abode was also jailed for seven years, four mionths

'Brennand had armed herself with a vegetable knife and was standing in the doorway.

'Steer tried to start the car, but failed. He ordered Mr Steyn to put his hands out and then tied them together with computer cable.

'The victim was then directed to lie down on the floor and his feet were tied together with more cabling. Ward punched Mr Steyn in the eye, causing it to bleed.

'The victim was begging the defendants to stop, saying he would show them how to start his car. Ward got a large carving knife.

'Steer, still unable to start the vehicle, came back into the living room and threats were made to stab the victim.

'Mr Steyn tried to convince the gang he could start the vehicle and they got him to his feet. As he shuffled to the front door, a cloth was fastened around his mouth and tied round his head.

Miss Johnson said Mr Steyn's legs were cut free, he was dragged to the car and it was started. Ward dragged the victim back into the house and pushed him into the kitchen, shouting : ' I will deal with this.'

Ward told Mr Steyn: 'I'm not back to jail again' then whilst still holding the knife, started wrapping a cloth around his hand. Miss Johnson continued : 'Mr Steyn feared for his life, thinking he was going to be stabbed by Zak Ward.'

Ward told the victim : ' Give it 10 minutes. I will call the police. I'm sorry. I never wanted anything anything to do with this. Tell the police I didn't steal anything.'

The gang then left but the Audi A4 was seen in Blackpool just before midnight after being driven by Streer through a red traffic light at 80mph. Police stopped it with a stinger device and found Steer was almost twice the drink drive limit.

In a statement Mr Steyn said since the offence his life had completely changed. He was afraid at home, his sleep had been disturbed, he felt stressed and he had been left scarred.

Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder William Smith said: 'The whole incident was a terrifying one for the victim. He was fortunate to have suffered relatively modest physical injuries, but he has, no doubt, the psychological scars that remain with him.'

After the case Det Con John Dodrill from Lancashire Police said: 'This incident had a devastating effect on the victim. Robbery is a very personal crime and the man has been left feeling terrified and violated in his own home.

'I hope the sentences will be seen as a stark deterrent to others. Tackling robbery is a key priority for the police and we will continue to do everything we can to target those involved and bring them to justice.'
