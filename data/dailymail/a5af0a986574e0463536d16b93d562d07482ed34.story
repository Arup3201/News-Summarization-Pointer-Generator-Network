This is the moment a burglar was arrested after he knocked himself unconscious when he fell 10ft through a ceiling into an off licence.

Steven Moylan was found on the floor of the Bargain Booze, in Birkenhead, by staff after the alarm was set off in the store.

The 35-year-old was trapped behind the glass-fronted cashier area after he fell when the ceiling above the store collapsed.

CCTV footage shows Steven Moylan as he was arrested after being found unconscious after falling through the ceiling of the Bargain Booze store 

Moylan fell through the ceiling after he broke into the upstairs flat and started prising up the floorboards

He was arrested by police who brought him round, but claimed to have no memory of how he ended up there.

The store's deputy manager Kathryn Birks said: 'I came out for the call and couldn’t see anything at first. I went in and turned off the alarm and then noticed the ceiling hanging down.

'I thought it must’ve collapsed under its own weight. Then I noticed what looked like a pile of clothes, then thought "hang on, there’s a head!"

'He was lying there covered in rubble up against the glass. I dashed back outside, locked the door and called police. I’ve never seen anything like it.'

Moylan had broken into an unoccupied flat above the off-licence before cutting through the carpet and prising up the floorboards to get into the shop.

The floor gave in however and Moylan fell 10ft into the store. A torch and gloves were later found near the hole.

He appeared before Wirral Magistrates' Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to one count of trespassing with intent to commit damage, and another of entering the Bargain Booze store with intent to steal.

The court heard he claimed to be living with his parents in Birkenhead, but they denied he was living there.

Tessa Hinder, defending, said Moylan had been drinking all day and didn’t remember anything else, but accepted he must have done it.

She said: 'It is one of the most poorly planned-out burglaries I have heard of.'

Moylan was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing next month for a pre-sentence report to be drawn up.
