A penthouse at the former Sony building on Madison Avenue in New York is set to become the city’s most expensive listing at $150million according to therealdeal.com – and it doesn’t even have a backyard or a roof terrace.

But it does have 21,000-square-feet of floor space, eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms and 10 powder rooms.

The triplex will occupy floors 33 through 35 of the 37-storey tower and its price is set to eclipse that paid for the current record holder – 57 St’s One57 overlooking Central Park, which went for a staggering $100.47million.

A penthouse at the former Sony building on Madison Avenue in New York is set to become the city’s most expensive listing at $150million

The apartment, in the Philip Johnson-designed building between 55th and 56th streets, is being built by real estate powerhouse the Chetrit Group and Clipper Equity.

The new owner will enter through a private elevator to living quarters worth about $6,975 per square foot, according to therealdeal.com.

Viewed this way it’s not worth as much as a new triplex coming on the market atop 520 Park Avenue. This will be listed for less - $130million – but will be worth $10,489 per square foot.

The owner of the Madison Avenue apartment will enjoy a gym and spa, a billiards room, wine room, media room, a library, a huge master bedroom with an adjacent study and a gallery for hanging art.

The commute for staff will be very short indeed - they get their own bedrooms and bathroom on the lower level. 

Blueprints: These plans, first published exclusively in therealdeal.com, show that the new owner will have a gym, spa, billiards room, wine room and a media room. Plus quarters for staff (pictured is the bottom level)

Roomy: On the middle level is a dining room, kitchen, living room and a library, plus access via the stairs to the first and third floors 

Top of the heap: The luxurious apartment also boasts several guest bedrooms and a gigantic master bedroom that has its own private study

The rest of Sony’s former headquarters will be transformed into 96 high-spec condos, bringing the total value of the development to around $1.8billion.

The Madison Avenue penthouse, while very expensive, is still much cheaper than the $237million paid for an apartment at the exclusive One Hyde Park development in London.

Apartments there start at $10million and owners enjoy sumptuous shared features including a cinema, a 21m swimming pool, saunas, a gym, a golf simulator, a wine cellar and a valet service.

Residents can call on valets, a concierge and butler room service from the next-door Mandarin Oriental hotel's two restaurants, overseen by Heston Blumenthal and Daniel Boulud.

The development also contains three boutiques which include Rolex and McLaren.

The next highest listing in New York is for $118million for three condominiums at the Ritz-Carlton in Battery Park City.

Someone paid a staggering $100.47million for a 10,923-square-foot penthouse apartment occupying the entire 89th and 90th floors of One57, the high-end skyscraper apartment building that overlooks Central Park. This is the most ever paid for a New York apartment

World's most expensive property: An apartment at London's exclusive One Hyde Park development sold for $237million 

This apartment at One Hyde Park in London can be rented for around $70,000, or £45,000 a week
