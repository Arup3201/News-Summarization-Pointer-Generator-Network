It was meant to be the happiest day of Katherine Marshall's life – the day she and her partner finally tied the knot.

But the night before the Toowoomba couple's big day, Katherine received a phone call from her doctor that would leave her fighting for her life over the next two years.

'He rang me up on Friday night at my rehearsal dinner to confirm that I had Hodgkin lymphoma. I definitely had the s***s with him,' Katherine told Daily Mail Australia.

Katherine Marshall found out she had a rare form of blood cancer the day before she married her partner Luke

Despite receiving the diagnosis at her rehearsal dinner while surrounded by 40 other guests, the 26-year-old said she simply didn't react to the news and that there was never any talk of cancelling the wedding

'I just didn't react. I didn't want to walk in crying,' she said of the heart-breaking moment.

'I had 40 family members sitting in a restaurant and I just ducked out and was just standing on the stairs. I knew it was coming but I just hadn't believed it.'

The 26-year-old, who was 24 when she learnt of her diagnosis, had been brushing off her symptoms for months, blaming them on her wedding-frenzy.

'I'd had itchy legs, night sweats and had lost heaps of weight. I just explained them away with different things,' Katherine said.

'The itchy legs I thought were was just dry legs from the warming weather, I was losing weight because of the wedding and the night sweats I just thought I was roasting myself with the heater at night.

'It was a week before the wedding that I noticed I had a lump on my neck, and I couldn't ignore that.'

Katherine and her husband were forced to cancel their honeymoon and 'postpone' their lives while she underwent ten cycles of chemotherapy

The newly-wed said the treatment, which lasted for almost seven months, left her feeling like she'd been 'run-over by a semi-trailer'. She said: 'it was very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel'

Despite the shocking diagnosis, the bride-to-be said she chose to ignore the cancer on her wedding day, which still made its presence known in the form of a patch on her neck from a biopsy.

'There was never any talk of cancelling the wedding,' she said. 

'I didn't want anyone to treat me differently, I just wanted people to celebrate the day. I didn't want to remember my wedding day as the day after I realised I was really sick.'

Although desperate not to cancel their honeymoon, Katherine's husband Luke soon convinced his bride to postpone their trip in order to start her chemotherapy as soon as possible.

The couple were forced to 'postpone' their entire life while Katherine underwent ten cycles of treatment which lasted for almost seven months and left her feeling like she'd been 'run-over by a semi-trailer'.

'We thought we'd go on our honeymoon, progress in our careers, buy a house, have kids and do all those sorts of things in the next few years,' Katherine said. 

'But we couldn't do any of that. I ended up finishing up work and had my treatment in Toowommba, but that didn't work so we had to move to Brisbane. Luke had to take time off work because the doctor said I needed a carer.' 

Two years later, Katherine is in remission and recovering slowly. She and Luke will finally have their honeymoon in November and hope to try their luck at having children in the next few years

'The treatment was awful, it's very hard to describe. You feel like you've been smooshed by a truck. You just lay there feeling dead because obviously the chemo is killing you.

'It was very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.'

Two years later however, Katherine is in remission and recovering slowly but surely.

Katherine will also speak to other patients and carers about her experience as part of World Lymphoma Awareness Day

In November, she and Luke will finally have the honeymoon of their dreams during a moth long trip to Europe.

They also hope to have their own children in the next few years despite the chemotherapy having destroyed Katherine's reproductive system, due to their doctor retrieving eight of her eggs which can be utilised through IVF procedures.

Now 26-years-old, Katherine is partaking in World Lymphoma Awareness Day, when she will speak to other patients and there carers about her experience, to help them feel they are not alone.
