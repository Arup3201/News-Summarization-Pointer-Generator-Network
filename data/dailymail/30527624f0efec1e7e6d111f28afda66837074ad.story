Nicolas Sarkozy was joined by supermodel wife Carla Bruni on the campaign trail last night as the former French president stepped up his campaign to retake the Elysee palace. 

Speaking at an event in Nice, Sarkozy vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration if he is returned to power as well as readdressing the free movement of people within the European Union. 

Last month, Sarkozy, 59, announced that he wanted to run for the candidacy of the centre-right UMP party for the French Presidential Election scheduled to take place in April and May 2017.

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was joined at the campaign rally by his wife Carla Bruni 

Ms Bruni, pictured, was said to be against her husband's plan to run again for the French presidency 

However, her presence at the rally is seen as she is behind her husband's campaign to run again in 2017

The former president addressed immigration, welfare tourism and the free movement of EU citizens during his speech.

Sarkozy told his supporters: 'Schengen is no longer working, we want a new Schengen.' 

The Schengen agreement allowed for the free movement of EU citizens and removed border checks. Britain and Ireland opted out of joining the Schengen area. 

Sarkozy said: 'We can no longer afford the luxury of distributing a number of benefits to people in France illegally.

'Caring for someone in an emergency situation it is a moral imperative, but medical tourism is a scandal.

'I want to end benefits tourism in our country.' 

Sarkozy was defeated by socialist Francois Hollande in 2012 and told journalists at the time that they would never hear from him again. 

Sarkozy, pictured, said last month that he was running again because the socialists 'were ruining France' 

In his speech to UMP party supporters, Sarkozy said he would clamp down on welfare tourism if elected 

But he indicated last year that he was considering a return to politics because the socialists 'were ruining France'. 

His wife, Carla Bruni, 46, had begged Sarkozy not to stand again as people were 'mean to him' when he was President. 

However, her presence at the rally in Nice will provide a significant boost to him in the opinion polls. 

Sarkozy's main rival for the UMP nomination is former French prime minister Alain Juppe, who has received the backing of former president Jacques Chirac.
