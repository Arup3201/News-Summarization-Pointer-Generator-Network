A Czech photographer has come face to face with some of the country's most dangerous killers and turned their mugs into art.

Radek Kalhous was allowed inside a notorious maximum-security prison the Hradec Králové Region in the northern parts of the Czech Republic where he captured eleven convicted murderers.

The chilling portraits include Radim Odehnal who invited a young couple into his home only to bludgeon the man to death with a hammer, and proceed to cook his flesh on a garden grill while raping the woman. 

Murderer: Jaroslav Stodola brutally murdered and robbed eight pensioners alongside his wife Dana

Pure evil: Radim Odehnal  invited a young couple into his house before killing the man with a heavy hammer and raping the girl four times while burning her boyfriend's flesh on a nearby garden grill

Teen killer: Tomas Vit was just 18 years old when he was sentenced to life behind bars for killing his two elderly neighbours when they refused to give him a painkiller

Another killer depicted is Jaroslav Stodola who brutally murdered and robbed eight pensioners alongside his wife Dana Stodolova.

Tomas Vit was just 18 years old when he was sentenced to life behind bars for killing his two elderly neighbours.

Vit had knocked on their door to ask for a painkiller, and when they OAP couple refused to help him he killed them using a hammer and knife.

He is the youngest person in recent history to be sentenced to life in prison  in the Czech Republic.

The images were taken at Valdice, a former Cartusian monastery, housing almost 2,000 inmates serving longer sentences.

In order to get enough people to be pictured, the photographer offered every prisoner who took part ten post stamps, 20 envelopes and ten  big format pictures.

He added: 'Eventually twelve murderers agreed and I chose 11 of them.

'The conditions were poor. Tiny interrogation room with white walls, bars in the middle. Unpleasant light from the fluorescent tube.

'A few guards, prison educators, secretary plus ten other people. And me and the camera. Then they kept coming in, one after another. I had ten minutes for each one.'

'The shooting took two hours and fifteen minutes. Then I got into my car and just stared into the space in front of me for almost one hour.

'Only when I got home, switched on the computer and took a first look at the pictures, I realised they were really strong.'
