Attack: The words of Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, will be felt acutely by Ian Duncan Smith

Coalition austerity measures are a disgrace that have left people facing hunger and destitution, according to the country’s most senior Roman Catholic.

Vincent Nichols said the Government had destroyed even the ‘basic safety net’ in welfare and the system had become ‘punitive’ toward those who did not understand it.

‘People do understand that we do need to tighten our belts and be much more responsible and careful in public expenditure,’ said the archbishop.

‘But I think what is happening is two things: one is that the basic safety net that was there to guarantee that people would not be left in hunger or in destitution has actually been torn apart. It no longer exists and that is a real, real dramatic crisis.

'And the second is that, in this context, the administration of social assistance, I am told, has become more and more punitive.

‘So if applicants don’t get it right then they have to wait for ten days, for two weeks with nothing – with nothing. For a country of our affluence, that quite frankly is a disgrace.’

His comments to the Daily Telegraph came as he prepared for a consistory in Rome at which he will receive a red cardinal’s hat.

He is one of 19 clerics chosen by Pope Francis to be elevated to the highest rank of Roman Catholic clergy.

It grants him a place in the conclave that will elect the next pope. As Archbishop of Westminster, he is the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales.

His attack will be felt acutely by the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who is a practising Roman Catholic.

In December, the Tory minister accused Church of England bishops of unfairly criticising his reforms. The Church had launched a campaign of billboards bearing the slogan ‘Britain Isn’t Eating’.

But Mr Duncan Smith rejected the campaign in a letter, which was leaked to the media. He wrote: ‘I strongly refute this claim and would politely ask you to stop scaremongering in this way.

‘I understand that a feature of your business model must require you to continuously achieve publicity, but I’m concerned that you are now seeking to do this by making your political opposition to welfare reform overtly clear.’

Archbishop Nichols has spoken out in the past on issues such as lack of compassion in the Health Service and the negative impacts of social networking site Facebook.

He attacked David Cameron’s Big Society push, which he said was failing, and last year condemned the Government for its ‘shameful’ response to the conflict in Syria.

In 2012, he criticised the Prime Minister for supporting same-sex marriage and described the proposals as undemocratic as well as Orwellian.
