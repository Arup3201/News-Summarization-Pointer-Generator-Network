Found dead: Drew Quinlan (pictured) had taken a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, his inquest heard

A privately educated schoolboy was found dead on the sofa of his family’s £4million townhouse after taking a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, an inquest heard yesterday.

Drew Quinlan, 13, was found face down on the settee of his grandfather’s  four-storey home in Richmond, South-West London.

He had consumed a toxic mixture of anti-depressants belonging to his family and alcohol, and had also been exposed to heroin in recent months, a post- mortem examination report stated.

Despite troubled periods, Drew was the ‘happiest he had ever been’, according to relatives. He had returned from a school trip to France before spending the weekend at the park and having a riverside lunch with family.

The evening before he died he had played video games with his uncle Michael Quinlan junior, who was also teaching him to play guitar. His mother was away and Drew had not wanted to sleep on the top floor alone so he had slept on the sofa near the family’s two labradors, his grandfather Michael Quinlan senior said.

But the following morning Mr Quinlan senior woke to find the teenager’s lifeless body lying in an ‘unnatural’ position.

He told the court: ‘I thought he was foxing, to the extent that I walked over and slapped him on the bottom and told him to get up. I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him up a little. Then I saw his face was blue.’

The post-mortem report showed ten times the therapeutic level of prescription drug citalopram and one and a half times the legal limit for driving of alcohol.

He had also been an occasional user or exposed to heroin in the months before he died. Drew, who attended a boarding school for troubled children in Sussex but had previously attended a private school in South-West London, was raised by his grandparents believing they were his parents.

Claims: Drew's mother, Samantha Quinlan, centre, heard evidence that  her son died after taking a lethal cocktail of drugs

A year earlier he had discovered that
 the girl he thought was his sister and who was battling a heroin 
addiction was in fact his mother.

In the months before Drew’s death his grandmother Vanessa had died after a long fight with motor neurone disease.

At
 the time Drew died his biological mother was in rehab and he was 
spending time with his biological father and his aunt.

His uncle Michael
 Quinlan junior, 30, who lived with them in the child’s grandparents’ 
house, was also a heroin user. His uncle and aunt both used the 
anti-depressant citalopram and his mother a similar prescription drug.

All
 three said they had no knowledge of how Drew came by the drug.

But his 
aunt, Kathryn  Tippett Wilson, alleged that Michael Quinlan junior gave 
Drew the drug in front of her just days before his death.

Coroner
 Jeremy Chipperfield recorded a verdict of accidental death at West 
London Coroners’ Court.

He said: ‘Drew was an intelligent and spirited 
boy of 13. He was regarded as a loveable and good boy and was loved by 
his family.

Despite the recent traumatic events in the family he was 
coping well in March 2011.

‘He spent March 27 – the last full day of his life – almost entirely in the company of his family.

‘All
 of them claimed to be unaware that he used or acquired drugs in their 
company but somehow or from somewhere he did acquire them and probably 
took them in sufficient quality to kill him.

‘It is likely he obtained these drugs from members of his family with whom he was in contact on the last day of his life.’
