Moves that could decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee will begin within days, the Culture Secretary will announce today.

A review of the £145.50-a-year levy is being brought forward by several months to ensure it is completed before the BBC Charter is renewed in 2016.

If agreed, it would mean non-payment of the licence fee – which accounts for more than one in ten cases brought before magistrates – would no longer be a criminal offence.

In a high-profile speech, Sajid Javid will announce the initial work into a review of TV licensing will be published ‘very shortly’, and question whether the current system ‘is really working’.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has pushed for laws to decriminalise licence fee evasion and replace it with civil penalties, said: ‘This shows the Government is taking it very seriously’.

Ministers had committed to launching a review and were planning for it to begin early in 2015, when a law to allow the changes receives Royal Assent.

But Mr Javid, who was appointed Culture Secretary this year, will tell the Royal Television Society conference of industry executives he no longer believes it can wait until the Deregulation Bill becomes law.

Doubts: Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has questioned whether the current system ‘is really working’

‘This needs to begin now,’ he will say. ‘Very shortly I will be publishing the terms of reference for a review of TV licence enforcement. I expect it to begin taking evidence in the autumn, and to conclude early in the next Parliament.’

He will add that calling for evidence straight away, ahead of the Charter Review ‘will allow it to shape the future of the BBC in a way that works for both the Corporation and those who pay for it’.

The move is likely to be popular with the public, although the BBC fears it could cost them up to £200million a year. The results of the review will not be published until after the general election.

Mr Bridgen proposed the amendment to the Bill in March this year, and forced it to a vote – managing to win the backing of MPs from all three main parties.

He said the existing laws penalised those on low incomes and called it a ‘shameful blot on our justice system’.

The proposal has also won the backing of Crown Prosecution Service director Alison Saunders and former BBC chairman Michael Grade.

In 2012, 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their TV licence, accounting for one in nine of all cases in the magistrates’ courts.

Most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines.

Mr Javid has already opened the door to slashing the licence fee itself, saying earlier this year that it represents a ‘large amount’ of money for many families.

In his first major interview he said ‘nothing should be ruled out’ when the levy, which raises £3.6billion a year for the BBC, is renewed for another decade in 2016.

A Tory source said last night: ‘Sajid was sympathetic to Andrew Bridgen’s amendment earlier this year, before he became Culture Secretary. He is persuaded the review should start sooner rather than later.’
