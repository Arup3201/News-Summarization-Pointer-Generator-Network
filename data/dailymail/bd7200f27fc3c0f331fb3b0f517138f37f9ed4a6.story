A Florida woman arrested on drug charges died a week after being taken to a hospital to have a crack pipe removed from her genitals. 

April Rollison, 31, was arrested in Babson Park for drug possession December 16 along with three other people.

During a body scan at the Polk County Jail, deputies spotted two items inside her body cavity. 

Sad end: April Rollison, 31, was pronounced dead in a Florida hospital a week after she had a crack pipe removed from her vagina following a drug arrest 

Inmate: Rollison was arrested December 16 on drug possession charges and taken to Polk County Jail, where she later went into medical distress 

Rollison was taken to Bartow Regional Medical Center to have the foreign objects removed from her body.

While a nurse was getting a bedpan for her from behind a curtain, officials believe Rollison pulled out a prescription bottle wedged inside her vagina and ingested some of the crack rocks inside.

The nurse then removed the glass crack pipe from Rollision's privates, after which she was returned to jail.

As she was being booked, however, the 31-year-old went into medical distress and was rushed back to the hospital, reported The Ledger of Lakeland. 

Rollision remained hospitalized in critical condition for a week until she passed away just before 11am Monday.

An autopsy will be performed on the inmate's body to determine a cause of death. 

Foreign objects: Detectives say the woman ingested crack rocks found inside a prescription pill bottle she had concealed inside her body cavity along with the crack pipe 

According to the Ledger, the 31-year-old Louisiana native tested positive for methamphetamine, amphetamine, cocaine and marijuana.

The State Attorney's Office will conduct an independent investigation into Rollison’s death while in custody.

Family members told investigators Rollison had been using drugs since age 12 and they had not had any contact with her in two years, according to Bay News 9. 

Jail records show the 31-year-old woman had a long history of arrests on drug charges.

Before her death, Rollison was charged with possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia and introduction of contraband into a detention facility.
