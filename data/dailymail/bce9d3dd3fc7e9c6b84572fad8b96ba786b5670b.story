Chris Eubank Jnr and Billy Joe Saunders finally came face to face as they weighed in ahead of their grudge match on Saturday night.

Until they both stepped on the scales at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square, Eubank had refused to square off with his opponent and also failed to attend the final press conference this week.

Both men were comfortably inside the 160lb limit for a fight that looks set to overshadow the heavyweight rematch between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora at the ExCel Arena.

It was the first time the boxers had squared off after Eubank Jnr failed to turn up for the final press conference

Earlier on Friday, a leading bookmaker took bets of £35,000 on Saunders and £10,000 on Eubank.

And the pair locked eyes for several minutes in front of several hundred fans with both refusing to face the front for photographs.

Saunders eventually broke the intense stare as Eubank's father watched on.

Each brings a perfect record to the ring with Saunders' British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles on the line.

The winner will also earn a shot at the WBO world title which will be contested by Andy Lee and Matt Korobov in Las Vegas next month.

Without doubt, Saunders has proved himself against a higher calibre of opponent to date but as the fight draws closer, opinion is increasingly divided.

And Saunders admitted earlier this week that this was the first fight he had prepared for in a professional manner.

He spent time in Marbella with trainer Jimmy Tibbs and at a media workout on Tuesday was only a couple of pounds over the middleweight limit.

'In my professional boxing career I've had 20 fights and I've won those 20 fights on work ethic alone because I haven't done my diet right,' he said.

'I know now I can't win a world title living the lifestyle I was living before. Kebabs, food, this, that, walking around at 15 stone. This time last year I was 16 stone – it was just a joke. I know I can't live that lifestyle – the elite fighters don't do it.

'When I won the European title in my last fight, the night before the weigh-in I got six-and-a-half pounds off in a sauna and I thought, "I never want to do that again".

'Some people have to learn from a loss but luckily enough I didn't have to and I got the win but I knew I had to learn from it.'

Eubank, meanwhile, believes he has won the mental battle before the first bell.

'I can see he is not mentally ready to face what is going to be brought to him on Saturday night,' he said. 'I could see he’s not ready at the press conference, with his nervous laughing and talking like he is a school kid. It’s going to be complete domination on my part in this fight.

'From day one of my professional career I have had people saying all types of things to me – from social media to trolls to haters. They have always been insulting me, whether it’s because they doubt my abilities or they didn’t like my dad so they don’t want me to succeed.

'So I’m used to insults and immune to any bad words that are directed towards me. He is not getting to me but I am getting to him by not reacting to the dumb things he says.'
