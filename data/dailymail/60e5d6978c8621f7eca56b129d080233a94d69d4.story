Kurdish and Iraqi fighters have 
reclaimed control of the country's largest dam from ISIS militants who 
captured it less than two weeks ago, an army spokesman in Baghdad said.

The
 Mosul Dam, spanning the Tigris River just north of Iraq's 
second-largest city, would mark the first major victory for forces battling ISIS jihadists since U.S. airstrikes began earlier this 
month.

ISIS militants have denied the claims, however, insisting they are still in control of the dam - which holds great strategic value as it 
supplies electricity and water to a large part of the country.

The development comes amid news that a takeaway owner from Liverpool and another man from Leeds have travelled to Iraq to fight alongside the Kurdish troops battling against ISIS.

The dam is around 30 miles from the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, where this picture - showing smoke billowing from a site close to the dam - was taken, moments after an air strike

Purpose: News of the dam being retaken comes as a takeaway manager from Liverpool, Mohammed Abudullah, revealed he had travelled to Iraq to fight alongside Kurdish troops, saying: 'I don't care if I die'

Mohammed Abudullah - who runs a takeaway food store in Liverpool - gave an interview to Sky News saying he felt just as at home holding an assault rifle in a war zone as he did running his shop

The retaking of the Mosul Dam would be
 a significant morale boost for Kurdish and Iraqi troops as they try to 
free territory overrun by ISIS in a lighting advance his summer.

Army
 spokesman Lt. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi said the dam itself was secured 
by Kurdish peshmerga troops and Iraqi security forces on Monday but that
 the southern side of the complex remains contested and that fierce 
fighting is underway to free that area.

At least 170 bombs have been dismantled around the dam but many more remain, al-Moussawi added in a televised statement. Al-Moussawi said the Iraqi and Kurdish forces 'hoisted the Iraqi flag over' the dam.

He
 added that the troops were backed by a joint aerial support but didn't 
specify whether there were any U.S. airstrikes in the area today.

News of the dam being retaken comes as
 a man from Leeds and a takeaway manager from Merseyside revealed they had travelled to Iraq to 
fight alongside Kurdish troops battling against ISIS.

Mohammed Abudullah - who runs a takeaway food store in Liverpool - gave an interview to Sky News saying he felt just as at home holding an assault rifle in a war zone as he did running his shop.

'Actually, I’ve got a British passport, I’ve got everything, I’ve got a 
life there, I don’t need anything but I’m here just for Kurdistan, for 
Kurdish people, for my family. I don’t care if I get killed or not,' he was quoted as saying.

Mr Abdullah appears alongside other Kurdish fighters in a video showing the group battling against ISIS militants Jalula.

Appearing overwhelmed by the fighting in comparison 
to the highly trained peshmerga, he said: 'My friends have been killed 
next to me. If people were killed next to you, you are going to be 
happy? No.... That’s why I feel I need to fight here. I’ll fight here 
until I’m going to die.'

In the footage, Iraqi-born Leeds resident Saman Baqu claims also he also travelled to the country from Britain, where he says he has lived for the last 12 years.

The dam, located on the Tigris river, supplies electricity and water for irrigation to northern Iraq

The dam is around 30 miles from the city of Mosul, and 280 miles from the Iraqi capital Baghdad

The claim that Kurdish and Iraqi 
forces had 'liberated a large part of the Mosul Dam' came from Iraq's 
Ministry of Defence this morning.

U.S.
 Central Command would not immediately confirm any involvement in the 
operation, although air strikes have been carried out in the area around
 the dam in recent days.

However
 one  senior Kurdish commander that his peshmerga forces had already 
withdrawn from the dam this afternoon because it was heavily rigged with
 explosives.

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to media.

In
 an internet statement, ISIS denied losing control of the dam, 
dismissing the government's claim as a 'mere propaganda war.' The 
statement, which could not be independently verified, was posted on a 
website frequently used by the militants.

Peshmerga fighters head towards the dam in a convoy of trucks. The recapture is a major victory in the fight against Islamic State extremists

The Kurdish forces launched the operation to retake the Mosul Dam early this morning, according to Kurdish commander General Tawfik Desty, after a day of U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes pushed back Islamic State fighters

The U.S. launched airstrikes against 
the Islamic State group in Iraq more than a week ago in a bid to halt 
its advance across the north.

The U.S. military said U.S. forces conducted nine strikes Saturday and another 16 on Sunday.

The
 dam's seizure by Islamic State militants on Aug. 7 was part of a string
 of victories by the Sunni radical group as it looks to expand its hold 
in northern Iraq, driving back Kurdish forces, sending minority 
communities fleeing and unleashing a wave of violence over a territory 
straddling the Syria-Iraq border.

The
 decision to launch airstrikes marked the first direct U.S. military 
intervention in Iraq since the last American troops withdrew in 2011 and
 reflected growing international concern about the extremist group.

A senior military commander said the advance of Kurdish forces was hindered by roadside bombs and buildings rigged with explosives, planted by retreating Islamic State fighters

The White House sent a letter to 
Congress on Sunday saying that its air campaign in Iraq 'is consistent 
with the president's directive that the U.S. military protect U.S. 
personnel and facilities in Iraq, since the failure of the Mosul Dam 
could threaten the lives of large numbers of civilians and threaten U.S.
 personnel and facilities - including the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.'

It
 also noted that the failure of the dam could 'prevent the Iraqi 
government from providing critical services' to the Iraqi people.

Some 1.5 million people have been displaced by fighting in Iraq since the Islamic State's rapid advance began in June.

The scale of the humanitarian crisis prompted the U.N. to declare its highest level of emergency lasts week.
