After weeks of turmoil on the domestic front, David Cameron enjoyed an unaccustomed bout of adulation yesterday in faraway Burma.

The Prime Minister was treated like a king on his visit to the former British colony now emerging from half a century in political isolation.

He held talks with Burmese leader Thein Sein at his sumptuous presidential palace in Naypyidaw, with its marble floors and awesome gold artefacts – in stark contrast to the extreme poverty experienced by ordinary Burmese people.

Mr Cameron was greeted by rows of 
fawning government officials in traditional dress at the palace, where 
he also enjoyed a three-course meal and was presented with a framed 
painting.

He then flew to Rangoon, the former 
colonial capital, where he witnessed celebrations for Thingyan, an 
annual week-long water festival during which the Burmese throw water 
over each other and passing vehicles using hoses, buckets and water 
pistols in an act which symbolises the cleansing of sins.

The Prime Minister’s car was 
repeatedly hosed down by cheering and waving crowds as he travelled in a
motorcade to visit the lakeside home of iconic democracy campaigner 
Aung San Suu Kyi.

There, Mr Cameron spoke of Britain’s 
‘friendship’ with Burma, which exactly 50 years ago was taken over by 
the military in a coup.

And he called for sanctions against 
the regime to be suspended, insisting that president Thein Sein’s move 
towards democratic reform should be rewarded.

Standing alongside 66-year-old Miss 
Suu Kyi in the garden of her villa, the Prime Minister said: ‘I think it
is right to suspend the sanctions that there are against Burma – to 
suspend them, not lift them.

‘Burma shouldn’t be as poor as it is, 
it shouldn’t have suffered under dictatorship for as long as it has and 
things don’t have to be that way.

‘There is the real prospect of change 
and I’m very much committed to working with you in trying to help make 
sure that your country makes those changes.’

Nobel peace prize laureate Miss Suu 
Kyi, who spent 15 of the past 22 years under house arrest by the former 
junta, won a parliamentary seat in a by-election a week ago.

The decision by Thein Sein to sanction
elections has been seen by the Foreign Office as an important step in 
the right direction for the repressive regime.

The country is now run by a nominally 
civilian government, but it is heavily stacked with former military 
personnel, many of whom are opposed to further liberalisation.

Mr Cameron admitted that Britain needed to remain ‘cautious and sceptical’ about promises of democratic reform.

Miss Suu Kyi said she hoped to see a 
‘happy ending’ to Burma’s democracy story. ‘We still have a long way to 
go but we believe we can get there.’

Mr Cameron, who also made a barefoot visit to a Buddhist temple, appeared at times emotional and awed by Miss Suu Kyi.

Paying tribute to her ‘struggle, bravery, courage’, he added that she was ‘an inspiration across the world’.

Miss Suu Kyi, an Oxford student in 
the 1960s, married British academic Dr Michael Aris in 1972 on the 
understanding that she must return to Burma if her people needed her.

They had two sons, Kim and Alexander.

She went back home in 1988 to nurse 
her ailing mother and has never left since – not even when her husband 
died of prostate cancer in 1999 after a three-year battle to see his 
wife.

She did not see her sons for more than
a decade after they were also refused visas to see her. She knew that 
if she left the country she would not be allowed back.

Mr Cameron said he had invited Miss 
Suu Kyi to come to Britain in June and hoped she would be able to visit 
her ‘beloved’ Oxford.

She responded: ‘Two years ago, I would
have said, “Thank you for the invitation but sorry”. Now I am able to 
say, “Perhaps”. That is great progress.’

A No 10 source said her visit would be
‘deeply symbolic’ of Burma’s progress. ‘It is part of the huge 
emotional price she has paid that she has not been able to visit 
Britain.’
