Angel di Maria made his Manchester United debut at Premier League opponents Burnley on Saturday following his £60million transfer from Real Madrid - and we watched his every move.

The Argentina star's arrival to Old Trafford is highly anticipated following a string of impressive displays last season in Spain where he played an integral part in Real's Copa del Rey and Champions League triumphs.

With the 26-year-old making his Red Devils bow, Louis van Gaal was be hoping for an early return on his investment.

In the zone: Di Maria has been named in the starting line-up by boss Louis van Gaal

5 mins - Di Maria has his first touch as a Manchester United player - running at the Burnley midfield before over-hitting a through ball into the path of Wayne Rooney. The United fans chant 'Argentina! Argentina!' in honour of their £60m signing.

12 mins - Wins his first free-kick in the Premier League after being fouled by former United player David Jones.

19 mins - The Argentine runs down the left wing doing a one-two with Van Persie, flicking the ball to the Dutchman, before crossing to Juan Mata who fails to get in a shot at goal from 10 yards out.

26 mins - Di Maria's poor first touch sets up Jones who hits a blistering volley that David de Gea tips over for a corner.

29 mins - Di Maria, again, pings a lovely 25-yard pass,this time into the path of Rooney who lays it off to Van Persie who fails to get a shot away.

VIEW FROM IAN LADYMAN AT TURF MOOR - United have grown in to the game and Di Maria’s role is already proving interesting. Nominally, he is playing centrally just in front of Darren Fletcher but has done most of his good work drifting out to the left side to try and hurt Burnley from there. The understanding with his team-mates is not necessarily quite there yet but he has shown enough already to illustrate how dangerous he can be. From their point of view, Burnley need to keep pushing at the soft centre of United’s defence. There do still seem to be mistakes there….

39 mins - Midfielder shows his pace breezing past two players before finding Mata with another pass.

Role reversal: Di Maria (top) is dispossesed by  Marney (bottom) in the first-half on Saturday

Impressive start: Di Maria came into the game more as it wore it on

HALF-TIME BURNLEY 0-0 MANCHESTER UNITED - Van Gaal will be pleased with the first 45 minutes of his £60m acquisition. The 26-year-old looks busy in midfield and played the pass of the match so far when he put Van Persie through on goal.

48 mins - Argentine wins his second free-kick after being hauled down by Danny Ings.

51 mins - Over hits a pass down the line meant for Ashley Young that goes out for a goal-kick.

Speed king: Di Maria showed his pace and trickery in spells before being substituted

52 mins - Di Maria has his first shot in a United shirt. The Argentine is played through by Rooney on the overlap and sees his drive blocked by Kieran Trippier.

58 mins - 26-year-old shows his blistering pace out-muscling and out-sprinting Trippier down the left flank before his ricocheted cross found Rooney. His mishit effort fell back to Van Persie who sees his deflected left-footed volley cleared off the line by Dean Marney.

64 mins - Di Maria goes down - to the anxiety of United staff, players and fans - but thankfully for them it's just with a bout of cramp.

69 mins - Di Maria's afternoon is over after he is replaced by Anderson.
