A former RAF Spitfire pilot who fought in World War Two has deployed his parachute for the first time - at the grand old age of 92.

Peter Proctor, from Southport, Merseyside, also served in Burma, India and Zimbabwe during the war but never had to pull his ripcord.

The seasoned pilot jumped out of a plane for the first time at Sibson Airfield, Peterborough, more than 70 years after he joined the RAF.

The sky's the limit: Peter Proctor, 92, from Southport, Merseyside, makes his first jump with his instructor

Mr Proctor, who has two artificial hips and a false knee, plunged more than 13,000 feet to successfully complete his first ever freefall jump.

He said: 'I've spent a lot of my life up in the air but this was a completely different experience.

'I was fortunate that I never had to deploy my parachute during the war.

'In all honesty it's a good job that today was the first time.

'It would have been a nightmare trying to open up the hatches and jump out of the plane back then.

'I'm so glad I've managed to complete the dive and I'd love to do it again in the near future.

'The whole thing was done and dusted in about six or seven minutes but it really did give me a great adrenaline rush.'

Mr Proctor joined the RAF in 1942 where he was stationed in Durban, South Africa, to do his training before being sent to Zimbabwe where he earned his wings.

He went on to become a fighter pilot in Egypt, India and went on a jungle self-preservation course before being sent to Burma in 1945. 

The pilot ended his career in the armed forces in 1946 to return to his job as a store keeper in a shoe factory and went on to become a lorry driver for 33 years.

His wife of 56 years, Olive, passed away eight years ago but Mr Proctor has been determined to continue travelling around the world.

He said: 'Olive died eight years ago and it was absolutely devastating.

'But I've had great support from my family and friends who always encourage me to enjoy life.

'I've been to so many countries during my life and I want to tick off as many more as I possibly can in the future.

'I wouldn't mind giving this another go - there's no better feeling for me than being up in the sky.

'Some of the views were phenomenal but it's a good job I had my goggles on as it was incredibly windy.

'I'm very grateful to the RAF for making this jump possible.'

Mr Proctor, originally from Rossendale, Lancashire, did the jump with the RAF Falcons and raised £3,000 for the Royal Air Force Association which provides support to servicemen and their families.
