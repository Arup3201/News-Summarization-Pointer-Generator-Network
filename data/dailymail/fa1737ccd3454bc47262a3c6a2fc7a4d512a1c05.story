A mother died when her car was hit by a train on a level crossing because a signalman mistakenly raised the barriers after becoming distracted by a phone call, a court heard.

The car that hairdresser Jane Harding, 52, was in was struck by a passenger train at 61mph and dragged 150 yards down the track.

A jury was told that moments before the crash, signalman Adrian Maund ‘panicked’ when a local farmer called for a second time seeking clearance to guide his sheep over another crossing further up the track.

Tragedy: Jane Harding was hit while crossing the track by car after Adrian Maund lifted the barriers too early

While he was distracted, Maund lifted 
the barriers, believing the Manchester to Milford Haven train had 
already passed the crossing, the court heard.

Maund, 43, only realised his fatal  
mistake when he saw it approaching at 80mph around a corner –  and 
frantically tried to lower the barriers and change the signal at the 
Moreton-on-Lugg, Herefordshire, crossing.

Mrs Harding’s husband, Mark, who was driving their Volkswagen Touareg, survived the incident with shoulder and pelvic injuries.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that 
although human error was a factor in the crash, the tragedy could have 
been prevented if Network Rail had not declined to spend £40,000 on a 
simple safety device which could stop signals being changed when a train
was approaching.

He was distracted by a call from a farmer asking if he could herd sheep across the tracks at Moreton-on-Lugg

The company, which owns and operates 
rail infrastructure, allegedly refused to install the approach-locking 
system during improvement works a year earlier because of cost concerns.

This decision made the firm equally 
culpable, according to Philip Mott QC, prosecuting. Mr Mott added: 
‘Network Rail took the decision not to install this device because it 
would cost £40,000 – that device could have saved a life.

‘An approach-locking system has been 
around since the 1960s and can be used to stop signals being changed 
when trains are still coming through. In 2009 there was quite a lot of 
work done at the Moreton crossing and the barriers were replaced. There 
were discussions to have an approach-locking device which were rejected.
Why not put in this device? The reason was money. Was the cost too 
great to avoid the cost of a human life?’

In a police interview in January 2010,
Maund said he lifted the barriers because he thought the train had 
already passed as cars were waiting at the crossing. But train driver 
Andrew Robins had too little time to slow down and struck the Hardings’ 
VW and a second vehicle, a Vauxhall Astra.

Smash: The court heard that a £40,000 safety device might have prevented the mother's death

Mother-of-one Mrs Harding, from 
Marden, Herefordshire, died after being taken to hospital. Carol-Anne 
Thornewell and her 12-year-old daughter, who were in the Astra, walked 
away from the crash.

Maund, from Leominster, Herefordshire,
has pleaded not guilty to failing to take reasonable care for the 
health and safety of railway and railway crossing users.

The maximum penalty he could face is two years in prison, and/or an unlimited fine.

Network Rail has also denied a 
separate charge of failing in its duty of care of the health and safety 
of railway and railway crossing users. It faces a maximum penalty of a 
£20,000 fine.

The trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
