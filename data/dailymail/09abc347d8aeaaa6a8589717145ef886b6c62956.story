Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai's wife has confessed to killing British businessman Neil Heywood to stop him revealing she illegally moved billions of dollars abroad, it was claimed today.

Authorities believe Gu Kailai transferred $6 billion (£3.85 billion) to accounts under the names of relatives and friends in the U.S., Britain and other countries to hide undeclared income she had been receiving since the early 1990s.

Heywood helped 53-year-old Gu - said to be his mistress - open the accounts and exchange currencies, the Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported, citing Communist Party sources.

Victim and suspect: British businessman Neil Heywood and Gu Kailai the wife of a top Communist Party official

Gu was under investigation for her financial dealings last November when Heywood was found dead in a hotel in Chonqing, the central Chinese city where her husband, Bo, was the Communist Party chief.

At the time, officials under the control of Bo said Heywood died from a drinking binge and quickly cremated his body. Now it is believed he may have been poisoned.

Gu and Heywood were reported to have had an affair and shared a £250,000 flat in Bournemouth when she she had set up a business in nearby Poole in 2001.

Mr Heywood was even spotted pinching her bottom as they walked up stairs, it was claimed.

Gu was detained because she
was 'highly suspected' of killing Heywood following a row over an 
unspecified financial conflict, according to official reports.

A family employee, Zhang Xiaojun, is 
also being held. Chinese legal system experts say it would be rare for 
someone of her stature not to be tried after being publicly named as a 
suspect.

Bo was ousted from his position in the Communist Party’s Politburo last  April following allegations of corruption and rumours of his wife’s involvement in Heywood’s death.

Gu, who is being questioned by government officials in northern China, allegedly gave a detailed description of how she committed the murder and admitted taking bribes.

The Asahi also reports that Gu confessed to receiving money from several companies 'on the back of her husband’s power.'

An interim report circulated among senior party officials, said Gu admitted to the murder because she felt 'driven into a corner' by the investigation into her finances, the newspaper reports.

It comes in the same week that a French former business partner of Gu's was arrested in Cambodia.

Architect
Patrick Devillers, 51, was detained last week in the capital Phnom Penh
in the latest twist to the biggest political scandal to hit China in 
years.

Cambodian government spokesman Khieu 
Kanharith said China had requested Devillers' arrest because of possible
involvement heywood's murder.

Kanharith gave no details of Devillers' alleged involvement, however, and said Cambodia was deciding whether to extradite him.

He also said they would not do so unless China provided more evidence. He said Cambodia could hold Devillers for up to 60 days .

The arrest was the latest twist in the scandal of Bo Xilai, who  has an estimated wealth of $135 million, according to the investment giant Bloomberg.

His downfall came after his former 
police chief fled to a U.S. consulate and revealed suspicions that Bo's 
wife was involved in Heywood's suspicious death.

Authorities are allegedly investigating whether he knew about his wife’s actions. They have also reportedly detained 'dozens of people' associated with the millionaire -  'including his chauffeurs, close aides and secretaries'.

News
reports have said that Devillers was closely linked to Bo, Gu and 
Heywood. It is not clear if he is accused of any crimes in China or 
elsewhere.

Phnom Penh 
police chief General Touch Naruth confirmed Devillers' arrest. He said 
he has been arrested 'with the co-operation of China'.

He added: 'We are considering whether to send him to France or China. China has demanded he be sent to China.' Calls to the Chinese Foreign Ministry rang unanswered last  night.

Devillers, an architect, had helped Bo rebuild the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian when Bo was the city's mayor in the 1990s, The New York Times reported last month.

The Frenchman and Gu were partners in setting up a company in Britain in 2000 to select European architects for Chinese projects. Both gave the same address of an apartment in the English city of Bournemouth, the newspaper said.

It cited an unidentified friend of Devillers as saying the architect left China in 2005 and has been living in Cambodia more or less continuously for about six years.

Devillers' father Michael, 73, expressed his 'shock' at learning of his son's arrest. From his home in Rainans, Burgundy, the semi-retired property developer said he appeared 'calm' 10 days ago.

He added: 'He had no idea he was in danger of being arrested, as he had intended to come to France for a trip over the summer.

'My aim is to have him repatriated in France. I will be speaking with a French consular contact in Cambodia and I intend to fly to Cambodia as soon as possible.'

He also revealed, as reported in the Telegraph, that his son was attracted to Gu and 'wanted to have a relationship with her'.

He added: 'My opinion is that he was ensnared in a web of manipulation by this woman.'

Eric Bosc, deputy to the French Foreign Ministry's spokesman, said Devillers was arrested on June 13 and the French consul has daily visits with him but that the reason for his arrest remains unclear.

'We have told local authorities that we are attentive that no follow-up of any kind be engaged without a clearly established judicial basis,' said Bosc, who deals with French in difficulty around the world.

'We have asked Cambodian authorities for clarification about the motives of his arrest.' Speaking by phone, he made no link to China, saying that only 'he is detained by a sovereign country'.
