A group of students spent 120 hours re-creating their home town in gingerbread, receiving praise from baking guru Mary Berry herself.

The 15th-century village of Bruton has been meticulously replicated - down to the stained-glass church windows - by pupils at King's School, Somerset.

It took a staggering 66lbs 
of icing, 9lbs of chocolate buttons and nearly 100lbs of gingerbread mix to create their 
masterpiece.

Ice, ice baby: It took 66 lbs of icing to cement the walls together and decorate the cottages in the Christmas cake village

Demanding delicacy: It took students at King's School 120 hours to design, bake, assemble and decorate the 60 buildings in the historical village

Their amazing scene includes the 15th 
century Packhorse Bridge - an iconic landmark in the town - and dozens 
of homes complete with tiny festive wreaths on the front doors.

The students at £27,000-a-year 
King's School were even congratulated on their masterpiece by Great British Bake Off expert Mary Berry who emailed to praise their baking skills.

Rose Vigers-Belgeonne, head of food 
science at Kings School, came up with the festive idea after watching 
Great British Bake Off contestants create gingerbread structures.

She said: ‘I decided to teach each of our 60 GCSE and A-Level Home Economic students to make their own gingerbread house.'

‘Then it dawned on me that we would be
making 60 buildings, which was an awful lot. We decided to make a 
replica of the town and the level of effort was incredible.'

99lbs (45kg) of gingerbread mix - flour, spices and syrup

66lbs (30kg) of icing - icing sugar, egg whites, lemon juice

4.5lbs (2kg) of mini marshmallows

8.8lbs (4kg) of chocolate buttons

8.8lbs (4kg) of boiled sweets

The pupils spent two hours each creating their gingerbread scene, spread out over two lessons.

They first prepared huge batches of 
gingerbread by mixing together flour, spices and syrup and baking for 20
minutes before cutting it into carefully calculated sections.

These were stuck together with 66lbs of
royal icing, with 4.5lbs of mini marshmallows, 8.8lbs of chocolate buttons 
and jelly sweets added for decoration.

Windows were made by melted boiled 
sweets - with different colours blended together to recreate the St 
Mary's Church's stained glass.

Original: The gingerbread town was modelled on Bruton village, where King's School is located

Stone muse: The student even made a gingerbread version of the 15th century Packhorse Bridge in the Somerset village

The gingerbread buildings were taken 
home by the pupils on the last day of term today - with some making 
their way to Russia and Spain.

Ms Vigers-Belgeonne added: ‘There were a few tricky bits, such as
putting the rooves on, but I think it looks wonderful, a fun sparkly 
festive thing to look at.

‘The pupils were so excited when Mary Berry emailed in. She said congratulations and a big well done to them.

‘It is now cool to bake, thanks to the Great British Bake Off and I have more boys than girls in my A-Level classes.’
