Unveiled: The Navy SEAL is set to reveal his identity in a televised interview next week - drawing the wrath of his superiors (file photo)

The commander of the Navy SEALs has lashed out at the 'selfish' serviceman planning to give a tell-all interview on national television describing how he killed Osama bin Laden.

Rear Admiral Brian Losey said that seeking 'public notoriety and financial gain' from sharing secret operations is a betrayal of Navy SEAL values, and warns that the military will take legal action against anybody who breaks the law by leaking information.

It comes ahead of an interview to be broadcast by Fox News, in which the as-yet unnamed Navy SEAL will reveal his identity.

The program, due to air November 11 and 12, also promises an 'extensive, firsthand account' of Operation Neptune Spear, the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which killed the terrorist leader.

Rear Admiral Losey made the attack in an open letter, co-signed by the Force Master Chief Michael Magaraci.

The letter was reporting by special forces news site SOFREP, which also named the SEAL. It is unclear whether the name is correct.

Although the message was not aimed at an individual, and was addressed simply to 'Teammates', it was a clear warning to the solider - also referred to as The Shooter.

In the letter, Losey emphasizes that military operations - like Neptune Spear - are accomplished thanks to thousands of servicemen, and that 'little credit' is due to any individual. 

Elsewhere, doubt has been cast on whether anyone can claim to have personally killed bin Laden, because the operation was so dark and chaotic that no SEAL would have been able to tell whether his shot had connected rather than anyone else's.

Target: 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was shot dead at his compound in May 2011. The identity of the SEAL that shot him has been a fiercely guarded since

Operation: This is the plan for Operation Neptune Spear, in which bin Laden's compound was raided and the terrorist was killed

Remote: Pictured above is bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. It has since been demolished

Losey wrote: 'A critical tenant of our Ethos is "I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions." Our Ethos is a life-long commitment and obligation, both in and out of the Service.

'Violators of our Ethos are neither Temmates in good standing, not Teammates who represent Naval Special Warfare.

'We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain, which only diminishes otherwise honorable service, courage and sacrifice.

'Our credibility as a premier fighting force is forged in this sacrifice and has been accomplished with honor, as well as humility.'

He finished by urging SEALs to 'continue to serve with honor on and off the battlefield' - a clear barb for The Shooter ahead of his plans to speak.

The letter follows a similar warning from the Pentagon last week, when a spokesman warned that everyone involved in the raid is bound by a non-disclosure agreement.

She told Business Insider: 'If in fact this individual was associated with the military unit that carried out the UBL [Usama bin Laden] raid, which is yet to be determined, he is still bound by his non-disclosure agreement to not discuss classified information, especially in a nationally televised interview.'

The Shooter has already spoken out - anonymously - about his apparent role in the operation, in an extensive account of the night for Esquire magazine.

In the interview he described the fatal moment, saying: ''I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for.

'And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up].

'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place.

Bated breath: President Obama, Hilary Clinton and Joe Biden, among others, are pictured above watching Operation Neptune Spear from Washington, D.C. as it unfolded

'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.

'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**.'

The Shooter is the second SEAL to divulge details of the night, following Matthew Bissonnette, the author of the 2012 book No Easy Day, controversially published without approval from the Department of Defense.

Teammates,

Each day, thousands of current and former members of Naval Special Warfare live as 'quiet professionals'. Our members continue to serve around the world, accomplishing critical and senstivie missions that contribute to our national security, and keep our nation safe.

We serve alongside many dedicated Patriots from across the military and all departments and agencies of our government. And, we serve alongside partners from many other nations who share an unwavering common commitment to long term security, stability and prosperity in the world. Any real credit to be rendered is about the incredible focus, commitment, and teamwork of this diverse network and the years of hard work undertaken with little individual public credit. It is the nature of our profession.

At Naval Special Warfare's core is the SEAL Ethos. A critical tenant of our Ethos is 'I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.' Our Ethos is a life-long commitment and obligation, both in and out of the Service.

Violators of our Ethos are neither Temmates in good standing, not Teammates who represent Naval Special Warfare. We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain, which only diminishes otherwise honorable service, courage and sacrifice. Our credibility as a premier fighting force is forged in this sacrifice and has been accomplished with honor, as well as humility. The most important credit we can garner is the respect of our Temmates and Partners.

Classified information is protected by law. All members exposed to classified information have a duty obligation to protect this information, regardless of what may be reflected in the media, accurate or otherwise. We will actively seek judicial consequence for members who willfuly violate the law, and place our Temmates, our Families, and potential future operations at risk.

Continue to serve with honor, on and off the battlefield.

Michael Magaraci, Force Master Chief and Brian Losey, Commander
