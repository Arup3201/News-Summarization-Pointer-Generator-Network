Rising Australian star Nick Kyrgios may be through to the third round of the Australian Open - but he's attracting the ire of fans after what many perceived to be arrogance in his post-match interview on Wednesday night.

Kyrgios, 19, made several cheeky if not snippy remarks after defeating 'giant' Croatian Ivo Karlovic in five tough sets at Melbourne Park - and many took to social media to express their disappointment.

Some even compared Kyrgios to fellow Australian tennis player Bernard Tomic, who has a reputation for his diva antics. 

He was particularly criticised for what some perceived as a sarcastic remark during his on-court interview when he was asked about being pushed into a final set. 

‘Yeah that’s usually what happens when you lose a fourth set, you go into the fifth one,' he fired back.

When asked about the loud shirt his father always wears to matches, Kyrgios was quick to shoot his supportive father down. 

'Yeah, Dad’s got his lucky shirt on, I don’t know why he does that, I mean I’m not big on karma or superstition so I don’t know why he does that,' he said, without a trace of a smile. 

Many took to social media to comment on his demeanour.

'What is it with young aussie tennis players being arrogant smart arses,' tweeted Adrian Gissara.\

'‏Tomic and Kyrgios need to grow up you're not superstars yet.'

Dannielle agreed, tweeting: 'Kyrgios seems so much cockier and arrogant this year at the #AusOpen . He seemed much more humble last tournament.'

Kyrgios took a moment to take a selfie with his dedicated fans after his win, who had supported him enthusiastically throughout the match.

However, many defended his behaviour, saying that he was just misunderstood.  

Nick Kyrgrios showed a more down-to-earth and appreciative side when he took to Social Media to interact with his supporters.

'So many great messages, I can't like and comment back to all but I read EVERY SINGLE ONE of them, thank you. #NoWords #Pumped,' he wrote 

An hour after Kyrgios' success, the second half of the Super Ks Thanasi Kokkinakis, 18, was knocked out of the tournament – losing to fellow Aussie, World. No. 75 Sam Groth.

Groth, 27, is championed for having the world's fastest serve. 

Tomic also had success against 22nd seed Philipp Kohlschreiber.

Unseeded Tomic came from behind after losing the first set to the German, taking out match after four sets. 

It will be another All-Australian competition when Groth and Tomic face off in Round Three.

Australian Jarmila Gajdosova was eliminated by Romanian Simona Halep who won in straight-sets in a speedy match which lasted less than an hour and ten minutes.

Sam Groth was overcome with emotion, wiping tears from his eyes as he claimed victory in the fifth set

19-year-old Kyrgios secured his win over 35-year-old Karlovic in four swift sets.

Karlovic is the ATP tour's tallest ever player at 208cm, whilst Kyrgios is only 193 centimetres tall.

Yet despite towering over the young Aussie, Karlovic was only able to steal one set off the home-grown hero.

The brightly-dressed teen is just one win away from facing off against second seeded Roger Federer in round four. 

The Swiss has won the Australian Open four times.

Meanwhile, 27-year-old Sam Groth from Narrendera NSW was the stronger competitor, winning the five-set playoff against a clearly-disappointed Kokkinakis.

The two Aussies had two sets apiece when Groth grabbed the win 6-1 in a blitzing final set.

‘The crowd was split but they were definitely fair on both of us,’ Groth said after winning the All-Aussie playoff.

‘It’s probably the best atmosphere I’ve ever played in, and I’d say I’m at career-best form.’ 

Contrarily, Kyrgios claimed victory swiftly and without the dramas that riddled his round one clash against Argentina’s Federico Delbonis.

He kept his cool, whereas round one was marked by an on-court tantrum that ended in smashed tennis racquet.

Kyrgios played without any discomfort, after he was given treatment for back pain in round one.

Speaking at a post-match conference, he said he enjoyed the atmosphere from the crowd, who supported him with great enthusiasm.

Nick Kyrgios took to Twitter to thank his supporters who inundated him with messages of congratulations

Again he knelt on one knee following his win to pay tribute to his grandmother, Julianah Foster.

He kissed the number 74 which he had tattooed on his finger, in reference to the age of his beloved grandmother when she died in 2014.

‘You may be gone, but I know you're watching,’ Kyrgios posted on Twitter after his win on Monday night. 

The young man from Melbourne will next play the winner of the match between World No.119 Edouard Roger-Vasselin and World No.75 Malek Jaziri.
