A Slovak magazine has been forced to publish a 54-page apology after falsely linking a politician to paedophilia and accusing him of swindling millions of euros.

Despite the original article taking up just two-and-a-half pages, the apology had to be published in large font over half of Plus 7 dní's pages.

The magazine was also ordered to pay former politician Stefan Zelník 55,300 euros in compensation after a 2009 article said he had used political contacts to pay his firm, Žilpo, 1.65 million euros of EU subsidies.

According to the Prague Post, the weekly news magazine also reported on an alleged statement from 
another politician who claimed to have information about Mr Zelník being
 involved in paedophilia.

The story was published in 2009, when Mr Zelník was an MP for the Slovak National Party, which was in government at the time.

The weekly lost a lawsuit brought by the politician and the court ordered that an apology be published in lettering the same size as the headline on the original story.

Editor-in-chief Miloš Luknár pointed out that the original article took up just two-and-a-half pages of the magazine.

The weekly news magazine, which was forced to pay 55,300 euros in compensation, is based in Bratislava

He said the ruling ‘amounts to a mockery on the part of our judiciary’.

According to the Post, Mr Zelník said he did not expect such an extensive apology.

But the magazine said the form of apology was suggested by the politician’s defence counsel.
