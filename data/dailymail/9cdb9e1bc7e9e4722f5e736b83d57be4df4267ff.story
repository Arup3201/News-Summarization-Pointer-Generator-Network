This is the terrifying moment a masked ram-raider screeched out of a high street bank in a car after smashing through glass doors to get to an open cash machine.

The thief, who was white and had his face covered with a balaclava, waited in a Nissan Micra opposite the Halifax in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire until staff opened the ATM inside.

He then reversed the grey car through the plate-glass doors of the Howardsgate bank, where he stopped the car, before speeding away down the pavement and rejoining the road.

A witness said one person in the bank was hit by the car and there were reports that a woman in her 30s had injured her ankle.

One quick-thinking bystander managed to film the crime, which took place at around 3.30pm, on his mobile phone.

The footage shows the car drive out of the bank at high speed, roaring off down the pavement while shocked passers-by watch helplessly.

Detective Sergeant Rob Burns said: 'We are appealing to anyone who saw the car reverse in to the bank or who may have seen the offenders before or after the robbery.

'Fortunately, no-one was seriously 
injured and we will do everything we can to apprehend the people who 
carried out the robbery.'

Halifax confirmed that an incident took place, but said they could not comment further while the police investigation was taking place.

In April, a callous gang of thieves 
smashed their way into a Cambridge hospital in a similar cash machine 
heist - fleeing with £10,000.

The four balaclava-clad thugs, 
dressed in white suits, crashed their black 4x4 through glass doors at 
the front of Addenbrooke’s Hospital, into the reception of a specialist 
clinic.

The roped the cash point to back of 
their car and pulled it from the building before it was stripped of money and dumped on the roadside a mile away.

The professional thieves then abandoned their car and climbed into a green BMW estate to make their getaway.
