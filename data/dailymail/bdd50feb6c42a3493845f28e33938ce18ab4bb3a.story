Facebook $1 billion acquisition of 
photo-sharing service Instagram is under scrutiny by the U.S. Federal 
Trade Commission - who are also questioning rivals Google and Twitter.

Inside sources said it was not immediately clear what specific information the FTC  was looking for.

The acquisition of the top photo-sharing service on the Internet is a crucial part of Facebook's strategy to bolster its mobile offerings, at a time when consumers are increasingly accessing the Internet through smarpthones.    

Probe: An investigation has been launched into the Facebook deal to acquire photo file-sharing service Instagram for $1billion

Facebook had said it hopes to complete the deal - the largest in Facebook's history - in the second quarter, but some observers think that may be an ambitious target, given the size of the deal and Facebook's status as the world's No.1 Internet social network with roughly 900 million users.    

The FTC's review of the deal comes as Facebook is preparing to raise as much as $12 billion in a record-breaking initial public offering that could occur as soon as next week.  

Some investors have cited Facebook's limited advertising revenue from the mobile versions of its service as a potential concern with regards to the company's long-term growth potential. 

Facebook and Twitter declined to comment. Google was not immediately available for comment.

Facebook has also acquired other start-ups such as Glancee in the run-up to its initial public offering on the stock market - expected to be the biggest silicon valley has ever seen.

The extraordinarily popular social 
network, now eight years old, has 900million members and could raise as 
much as $100billion - £61.6billion - at the launch.

It
 is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world's biggest - 
stock market entry of an Internet company since Google floated in 2004.

Under the microscope: Facebook is expected to go public later this week

The roadshow offers Zuckerberg a
 chance to present his strategy to investors ahead of the offering, and 
Facebook's management will be keen to present the company in the best 
light possible to get as high a valuation as possible.

He
 will speak to major buyers - such as investment bankers - to allow them
 to evaluate the company's management and prospects. Their interest, or 
lack of, will play a major role in the final flotation price.

The company hopes to raise about $5billion in the offering, giving the entire company a value of about 
$100billion.

Facebook's revenue has dropped - leaving investors worried ahead ahead of the float

The world's largest social network reported its first quarter-to-quarter revenue slide in at least two years.

Investors
 took it as a sign that the social network's sizzling growth may be 
cooling as it prepares to go public in the biggest-ever Internet IPO.

'It was a faster slowdown than we would have guessed,’ said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.

‘No
 matter how you slice it, for a company that is perceived as growing so 
rapidly, to slow so much on whatever basis - sequentially or annually - 
it will be somewhat concerning to investors if faced with a lofty 
valuation,’ Wieser said.

The IPO was thought to be delayed 
after Zuckerberg 'single-handedly' bought photo-sharing site Instagram 
for a billion dollars last month, but now the IPO process seems to have 
begin in earnest, with a source telling Reuters that the acquisition 
review processes are almost complete.

Facebook
 has set up a two-tier share structure, allowing Zuckerberg to keep 
control of Facebook by holding voting shares. Other tech IPOs have 
followed the same path, including when Google floated.

Scott
 Sweet, of research firm IPO Boutique, said: 'I have not seen as 
broad-based interest in an IPO since Google. Investor demand is immense.

'I expect a roadshow that will rival all roadshows where investors will be turned away at the door.'

It
 is perhaps the right time for Facebook to float, as the rate of new 
sign-ups appears to have peaked, and the company's net income fell by 12
 per cent in the first quarter due to heavy costs, although revenue 
continued to soar.

A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment on the speculation.
