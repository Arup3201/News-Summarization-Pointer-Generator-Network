A man who tried to evade Colorado cops by allegedly carjacking three cars - including one with a four-year-old boy inside - has been captured following a 75-mile high speed chase.

Ryan Stone, a 29-year-old who was wanted in a drug case, caused multiple pile ups on Wednesday and then tried to out-run police on foot but eventually surrendered when he could not climb a fence.

Dramatic helicopter footage captured the chase that was televised live during the morning rush hour.

A state trooper was injured after being struck by Stone while putting down stop sticks in a bid to stop him, but it is not clear if this was intentional. The little boy in the carjacked vehicle was not harmed.Â 

Start of the chase: Ryan Stone, 29, drives an allegedly stolen red SUV, left, with a boy inside on Wednesday

Second car: Footage shows Stone leaving the red SUV with the child and carjacking another vehicle

Aggressive: He then allegedly stole a gray minivan and rammed another car on the road

Violent: He then hit another vehicle, pictured, and pulled its driver from inside and then her to the ground

Longmont Police Department spokesman 
Jeff Satur said a warrant had been issued for Stone after he failed to 
appear in court March 4 on a 'dangerous drug' charge.

Stone
 was with his girlfriend when she was stopped in an apparently stolen 
car in Longmont Tuesday night, he said. Stone was not picked up then, 
but it's not clear why.

Then
 at 6am on Wednesday, Stone allegedly stole a sport utility vehicle with
 four-year-old Allen Chavarria-Rodriquez inside from a gas station in 
Longmont, north of Denver.

The boy's mother had left the car with the boy in it as she went inside the gas station, and the suspect jumped
 into the vehicle and sped south on Interstate 70.

Caught: Then at an intersection 75 miles from the start of the chase, police caught up with him

Desperate: He jumped from the car and tried to make a run from it as police circled him

Making a run for it: Stone, who was wanted for drug offenses, ran through the snow to escape

Stopped: But he had trouble climbing a fence and police caught up with him and he was arrested

An Amber Alert was released to locate the boy and a surveillance image of Stone was released.

At 7.15am, a State Patrol 
officer spotted the vehicle in the Thornton area.

After about a half hour, Stone 
stopped and carjacked a minivan and took off in it the wrong direction 
on the highway. He eventually got into the right lane before rear-ending another car.

After the smash caused the minivan to lose a tire, he hit another vehicle 
and threw the female driver out of the car and jumped behind the wheel, leaving her screaming at the side of the road.

For most of the time, police appeared to hang back, even after the suspect abandoned the SUV stolen with the boy in it.

In custody: Ryan Stone, left, was arrested and four-year-old Allen Chavarria-Rodriguez, who had been inside one of the stolen cars, was returned safely to his family. He was shaken up but otherwise unharmed

Safe: His mother, pictured, left him in the car while she went to the gas station but left to find him missing

Search: After Stone took off with the boy, authorities released this photo of him to track him down

As he neared an intersection, he collided with another vehicle and was surrounded by police. Cornered, he jumped out and tried to escape on foot.

He
 ran off, crossing the parking lot of a business and running so wildly 
he lost his jacket.

He struggled to jump a fence, and then seemed to 
give up, lying face-down in the snow in jeans and a white tank 
top. Three police officers reached him, pinning him to the ground around 8am.

Stone was 'definitely running like a person who did not want to go back to jail', Satur said.

The boy was shaken up but not hurt when he was found by members of the 
Commerce City Police Department in his mother's abandoned SUV.

Stone covered about 75 miles before being caught, avoiding congestion closer to downtown.

'This is a strange and crazy morning in Colorado,' Douglas County Sheriff David Weaver said.

Stone
 was taken to a hospital, in part to see whether he was high or drunk.

Authorities said it appeared at one point he threw something from one of
 the cars. Police were searching to see if they can find a weapon he may
 have had.
