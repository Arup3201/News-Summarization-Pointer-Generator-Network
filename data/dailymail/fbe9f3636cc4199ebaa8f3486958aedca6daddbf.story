Lewis Hamilton has landed back in London amid reports he is trying to salvage his relationship with Nicole Scherzinger.

The Formula One world champion chartered a private jet to fly him from Spain, where he was testing at Circuito de Jerez, to England.

His arrival comes after Scherzinger opened up that she still loves the Mercedes ace.

MailOnline have contacted both Hamilton and Scherzinger's representatives for comment. 

Scherzinger admitted that she is 'devastated' when she called time on her long-term on/off romance with Hamilton.

The former X Factor judge's split from Hamilton was revealed on Wednesday and speaking to The Sun's Dan Wootton, she said: 'I'm devastated that it didn't work out. It was the hardest decision we had to make, but we made it together.'

However, she claimed that the two are still bound by love for each other, despite this being their fourth break-up. 

'I love Lewis and I know he loves me,' she added.

'We wish nothing but happiness and the very best for one another. I'm trying to stay strong in my faith right now.

Despite the apparent friendliness between the two stars, though, a source alleged to the paper that part of the reason for their latest split was due to a series of rows over the festive period.

The 36-year-old singer parted ways from the British sports star, 30, due to the pressures of a long-distance relationship, causing the couple's seven-year  romance to come to an end once again. 

Despite making happy appearances together recently, it wasn't to be for the twosome who have tried time and time again to make their high-profile relationship work. 

And she hinted at the split in a relationship with the Daily Telegraph just last week, explaining: 'I have made sacrifices. I've left LA, left all my friends and my family. It's sacrificing your time in relationships, with loved ones...' 

Scherzinger and Hamilton are believed to have split because he wasn't ready for children, she told the Telegraph's Sarah Rainey that she sees herself as a mother within the next 10 years.

Asked if she wants marriage and children in the next decade, she said: 'Oh yeah, I’ll definitely have that by then. I’ll definitely have that. Definitely, that would be nice…'

Saddened: Lewis Hamilton was also notably downtrodden as he spotted at the Jerez racetrack in Jerez de la Frontera, Southern Spain on Wednesday

Difficult times: The 30-year-old Formula One driver has been in a seven-year long on-off romance with Nicole, and he failed to hide his sadness during training

Speaking about the break-up, a source close to the star told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'It was a mutual decision. The long distance kept them apart for long periods of time.

'They both spent most of their time alone because they were in different countries all the time. Nicole is heartbroken and devastated.'

And as the talented star arrived at the Palladium to perform on-stage as Grizabella once again, Hamilton looked similarly downcast when he was spotted at the Jerez racetrack in Jerez de la Frontera, Southern Spain.

Keeping his eyes shielded with sunglasses, he too appeared out of sorts and looked painfully heartbroken.

Scherzinger - who is currently starring in the West End revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats at the London Palladium - primarily resides in Los Angeles, while Lewis is based in Monaco.

Since the blow to her personal life, Nicole has been supported by her family, with her mother Rosemary and elderly grandmother flying to London from Hawaii to be by her side during this difficult time. 

Support: As recently as November, Nicole was in Abu Dhabi to cheer on her man as he won the world title

The talented former X Factor judge is now said to be throwing herself into her last few days on the stage in Cats, before heading back to Los Angeles next week. 

Speaking about the break-up, a source close to the star told MailOnline: 'It was a mutual decision. The long distance kept them apart for long periods of time.

'They both spent most of their time alone because they were in different countries all the time. Nicole is heartbroken and devastated.' 

The friend added: 'Nicole was really lifted by her family's visit. It was the first time her grandmother had been to visit her in London, and it couldn't have come at a better time.

'She's been throwing herself into work for the past few weeks and it's been a real tonic. They both care about each other deeply, and really wanted this to work out.' 

It's over: The couple initially met in 2007 and have split several times over the years, but a source thinks that love will bring them together once again

The couple originally went public with their relationship in 2007, but briefly split in January 2010 when they had been together for 20 months, before later reconciling.

They then split again in late 2011, before giving their relationship another go in early 2012.

But the beautiful twosome called time on things once again in July 2013, which prompted Nicole to break down in tears during her time on the X Factor judging panel.

However, by February 2014 things were back on. 

But another source hasn't ruled out a reconciliation between the two.

'It's been seven years now, and it's always the same reason that splits them up,' the second insider said. 

'Love always brings them back together.'
