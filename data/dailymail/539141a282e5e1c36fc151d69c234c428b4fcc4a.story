Security will be tightened at this weekend's London Marathon in the light of the Boston bombings, the Home Secretary told MPs today.

Theresa May revealed that more police will monitor the event to prevent a repeated of the horrific terror attack at the finish line of the race in America on Monday.

Giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mrs May said: 'They’ve made some adjustments to policing. They’ve put in some increased policing for the marathon.'

Nearly all of those who had signed up for Sunday's race say they will run despite the attack, although some admit they are nervous for the safety of spectators.

Nick Clegg today insisted everything possible was being done to ensure the London Marathon passes off safely following the Boston bombing.

The marathon, which will be preceded by 30 seconds' silence for the bombing victims, will feature an appearance by Prince Harry.

The attack in Boston on Monday saw two bombs go off at the finish line of the famous race, killing three people and injuring more than 170.

But a number of London runners told ITV News last night that they would not be cowed by the terrorist atrocity.

'There's
going to be an element of worry but they are ultimately there to 
support us and everyone's going to stick together,' one said. 'We are 
not going to let anybody put us off finishing.'

One mother of three said she was worried about spectators being hurt at the event, saying: 'I'm not taking my children now because they are just nine months, four and five and I don't feel comfortable about taking them.'

Another added: 'I have a question mark over whether my husband will bring my six-year-old daughter to the finish line.

'We have tickets for the grandstand through the charity we are running for and obviously since Boston that makes us feel a little bit nervous.'

In his weekly LBC 97.3 radio 
phone-in, the Deputy Prime Minister said the images from the United 
States had been 'heartbreaking' and he understood that people were 
anxious.

'I have spoken
to the Met Commissioner himself about this yesterday, and I have a huge
amount of confidence in the police and security services of this 
country,' Mr Clegg said.

'They
do an amazing job keeping us safe all the time. They are doing a 
double, triple, quadruple checking of all their arrangements for the 
Marathon, because of course what happened in Boston is just horrific.

'To see all these pictures of these happy families on a summer day at the finishing line, and of course these photos of this poor little eight-year-old, is just heartbreaking. So anxiety is the most natural response to that.'

In attendance: Prince Harry will hand out medals at the race, which will feature well-known competitors such as former England captain Andrew Strauss, right

Prince Harry has a long-standing commitment to preside over the medal ceremony at the end of the race, and Palace sources this week said that his plans had not changed.

Runners will be encouraged to wear a black ribbon to commemorate the victims of the Boston bombing.

Marathon chief executive Nick Bitel said he was confident the race would be safe and would be an event in which 'humanity can be united'.

'One of the great things about the London Marathon is that it is perceived as being this event that brings people together,' he said.

'One of the founding principles of the London Marathon was to show that at least on one day humanity can be united.

'We instigated a full security review. Considerable extra police and our own security resources will be employed.

'London
is one of the safest cities in the world. We saw last year with the 
Olympic Games the Metropolitan Police lead an incredible security effort
around the Games. There is really no finer force in the world in 
answering these type of threats.'

One of the runners will be former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss, who said he wanted to represent the people of Boston and prove that 'terrorism doesn't work'.

The 36-year-old will represent the Lord's Taverners charity in the race.

It is not the first time Mr Strauss has had to stand firm in the face of terror fears, as he was part of the England team which toured India in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks in 2008.

'It's a horrendous tragedy and I think this is an opportunity for all of us that are involved in the London Marathon to come out and do our bit and show a bit of solidarity and also show that we're not going to cower with fear,' he said.

'The world goes on and this is our opportunity to show in our own tiny little way that terrorism doesn't work.'

Other celebrities, including reality TV star Amy Childs and Holby City actress Amanda Mealing, also said the attacks had made them even more determined to do well in the marathon.

Kenyan runner Wilson Kipsang has vowed to defend his London title, saying: 'We are really sorry for what happened in Boston, but we should have no fear during the race because security matters will be put in place and we will run feeling free.'
