The other woman: Tara Fillinger says she has been dating John Andrew Welden for seven years

A Florida man allegedly gave abortion pills to his pregnant girlfriend so that his other girlfriend wouldn't find out about their relationship, it has been revealed.

Remee Lee - who lost her seven-week-old fetus - wasn't the only woman in John Andrew Welden's life. She wasn't even his 'main' girlfriend, according to evidence filed in federal court on Tuesday.

Welden, 28, the son of a Tampa-area obstetrician, had been seeing Miss Lee, 26, for about seven months when he learned that she was pregnant with his child.

He also had another girlfriend, Tara Fillinger, who he had been dating for about seven years. Federal authorities say Welden didn't want Miss Fillinger to find out about Miss Lee. 

Miss Fillinger filed court documents 
asking a judge to grant Welden bail so he can be released while he 
prepares to defend himself against the charges. She said that she and 
Welden had talked about getting married and were looking at buying a 
house together.  

Federal prosecutors also released a 
text message exchange between Welden and Miss Lee in which she revealed 
that she had already decided on a name for her unborn child, according 
to the Orlando Sentinel.

'I thought of a nice name for whatever it is. Memphis Remington Welden. Kids gonna be a bad ass!' Miss Lee says.

Welden responds: 'Oh God I want to die … Are you serious Remee please don't do this I beg you.'

'Don't do what? Take responsibility for my actions?' Miss Lee responds.

'This isn't about us anymore. It is not it's fault, why should it have to die? You must not be who I thought you were if you are asking me to murder our child.'

Welden replies: 'I can't I hate myself now. Fine I can't do this I am destroyed.'

Federal prosecutors revealed on Tuesday that Welden, who is being held without bail, is now under investigation for witness tampering and mail fraud.

He was recorded on jailhouse phone calls threatening to smear Miss Lee's reputation. He also told Miss Fillinger that she didn't have to testify in the case, according to court documents.

Long-term: Miss Fillinger filed an affidavit asking judge release Welden on bail. She said that the couple had been together for seven years and were talking about buying a house together and getting married

Welden was arrested in May and accused of tricking his girlfriend into taking the abortion drug Cytotec by changing the label and telling her it was an antibiotic.

Authorities say he forged his father's signature on a prescription for the drug. Miss Lee had had an ultrasound at Dr Stephen Welden's office, which confirmed she was pregnant.

John Welden told her his father had prescribed her antibiotics and gave her a bottle of the abortion drugs. Miss Lee told authorities she never called the doctor's office to confirm the prescription because she trusted Welden. 

She took a bill on the way to work and immediately began to bleed and have pain. She lost the baby at the hospital. It was there, that a doctor saw the pills Miss Lee took and told her they were meant for inducing pregnancy - or abortion.

Federal prosecutors allege Welden never wanted Miss Lee to have his baby - even though she was determined to keep the pregnancy and raise the child.

'Weapon of choice': This is the bottle of abortion pills that Welden gave to Miss Lee. He changed the label to so that she would think they were the antibiotic Amoxicillin

Welden worked as an office manager at one of his father's clinics and is attending college for sports medicine. 

He also had a long-term on-again-off-again girlfriend - Miss Fillinger. 

Court documents reveal that she had become suspicious after she found Miss Lee's positive pregnancy test and prenatal vitamins in his car. He lied and told her that both items belonged to his sister.

Federal authorities also released a transcript of a conversation Miss Lee had with Welden. After she lost the fetus in the hospital, she went to police and agreed have her conversations with Welden recorded.

Welden told Miss Lee that Miss Fillinger, his other girlfriend, had found out about their relationship and was 'furious.'

Miss Lee says: 'If you wanted to go be with Tara, that's fine. Go be with Tara.

'I woulda had my kid and I woulda been fine with that... woulda told my parents it was someone else's. I wouldn't have bothered you for money. I wouldn't have bothered you at all.'

'I didn't want to be that guy,' Welden replies.

'So you're going to be the guy that goes and just kills the baby without even letting me know?' Miss Lee says.

'To save your own precious hide? Right?'

Welden responds: 'I guess. If I saved anything, I didn't really save anything.'

Welden also takes time during his conversation with Miss Hill to pity himself.

'My life is over,' he whines. 'I just wanna kill myself.'

After he admits to giving Miss Lee the abortion drug he says: 'I'm  just a horrible person, Remee. I'm sorry I ruined everything.'
