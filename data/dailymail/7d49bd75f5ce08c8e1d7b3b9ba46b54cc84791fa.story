A Texas woman is recovering after a shark bit off 10lbs of flesh from her back while she was snorkeling in the Bahamas.

Lacey Webb, 34, from Dallas, was in the water near the Abaco Islands with her husband when she was attacked.

She was filming a stingray underwater when she saw a shark swim by, but she continued to shoot.

'The stingray, at one point, abruptly left, and as I went to the surface, and I was vertical to the water column, and the shark hit me from behind,' she said in a press conference covered by WSVN.

'I knew immediately that it was a shark bite, and I also, in the top point in my mind, realized my husband was in the water.' 

'When I surfaced, I knew I had to communicate what had happened to get my husband out of the water. 

'Then I had to get my face back in the water so I could swim for the boat.'

Ms Webb was filming a stingray underwater when she saw this shark swim by and she continued to film. The picture is from her underwater footage moments before the bite

The couple are determined go continue with their love of snorkeling.  The shark left a tooth in her back which she is planning to have made into a necklace to remind her of the ordeal and her bravery

Her husband Britt, who sat next to her at the press conference, said: 'It happened so fast, but she was so calm until she pulled herself up to the swimming platform.

'I thought she was joking, and when she started pulling herself up, I saw the severity of the situation, and I immediately jumped on the boat and just started grabbing towels and realized we had to think quickly and to work quickly 'cause a life-or-death situation was happening.'

Ms Webb was flown by air ambulance to Memorial Regional Hospital.

She has undergone several operations and once released, she will need further reconstructive surgery.

The shark left a tooth in her back which she is planning to have made into a necklace to remind her of the ordeal and her bravery. 

She said she also plans to go back snorkeling soon and refuses to be cowed by the accident.
