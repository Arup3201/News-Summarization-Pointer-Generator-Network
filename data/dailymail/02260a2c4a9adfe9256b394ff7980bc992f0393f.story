A Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus elephant was shot in a drive-by shooting while resting in its pen early Tuesday morning.

The 39-year-old Asian elephant named Carol was standing outside Tupelo, Mississippi’s BancorpSouth Arena around 2am when a single shot was fired into her enclosure, according to police.

'She was shot between her ear and her shoulder, kind of in the base of her neck,' Capt Rusty Haynes of the Topelo police department told MailOnline. 'She's going to be OK.'

Shooting victim: Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus elephant, Carol, seen here last December, became the victim of a drive-by shooting on Tuesday morning in Mississippi but is said to be recovering well

Felony offense: The elephant, seen here performing, is believed to have been intentionally shot by a gunman facing him or her with felony charges since Asian elephants are endangered

'I think it was malicious act,' Haynes said of the gunman's intent, before adding he believes it was out of 'stupidity' alone.

A security guard at the scene was able to immediately send for help and medical assistance for the elephant.

Twenty minutes later she's said to have been walking around her enclosure eating carrots, Kevan Kirkpatrick, BancorpSouth Arena's marketing director told the Clarion Ledger.

An elephant’s skin is an average of 1 inch (2.5cm) think in most places, while extremely tough.

The type of firearm used was not immediately known 
on Tuesday, with police saying the bullet encasing has yet to be removed
from the animal for analysis.

Survivor: The elephant is said to be doing very well and recovering after her injury, with elephants' skin typically being up to an inch thick in places (file photo)

'[Dr. Dennis] Schmitt 
located a dime size point of entry on the elephant’s shoulder,' BancorpSouth said in a statement on their Facebook page late Tuesday.

'Upon 
further evaluation the elephant is active, mobile and comfortable. She 
is being treated with medication and will be taken to Springfield, 
Missouri where she will remain under veterinary care over the next 
several weeks. Carol is expected to make a full recovery,' it read.

No other animals were harmed and the circus has flown in their own veterinarians to follow up on the elephant's health.

Because Asian elephants are an endangered species the crime is a federal offense under the Endangered Species Act.

Authorities say they are now looking for a white or silver Ford Explorer that was seen driving past the scene at the time of the attack.

Haynes says they currently have no suspects in the case, emphasizing to the Carion Ledger: 'We're dealing with a victim that can't talk.'

Police say they are reviewing area 
surveillance footage and requesting the public's help for any tips and 
information leading to the shooter.

The elephant is part of the circus in town for a series of performances with the Tupelo show beginning on Thursday that are planning to go on.

'We have had the circus once a year since 1995,' Mr Kirkpatrick said. 'Absolutely this is the first elephant shooting we’ve had.'

Outpouring of support and sympathy for the elephant has since been seen on BancorpSouth's Facebook page.

'I am praying for the elephant that got shot just sad,' one man wrote.

'Sick, sick world we live in. Soooooo sad,' another woman wrote.
