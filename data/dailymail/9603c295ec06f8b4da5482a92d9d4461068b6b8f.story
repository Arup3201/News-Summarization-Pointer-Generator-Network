A Saudi celebrity cleric who allegedly raped and murdered his five-year-old daughter has claimed he injured her because he doubted she was a virgin. 

Lama al-Ghamdi died in October having suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, severe burns, broken ribs and fractured left arm as well as extensive bruising.

Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitted using a cane and cables to inflict the horrific injuries after doubting his daughter’s virginity, according to the campaign group Women to Drive.

After the case attracted international attention, members of the Saudi Arabia's Royal Family are now believed to have blocked al-Ghamdi's release and ensured that a stronger sentence is upheld.

Killed: Lama al-Ghamdi died in October having suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, broken ribs and left arm as well as extensive bruising.

Women to Drive said the preacher, a regular guest on Muslim 
television networks, had his daughter checked up by a medic after doubting her virginity.

It has been alleged that she was repeatedly raped and had been burned to cover up the injuries she had sustained from the horrific
sexual abuse.

Yesterday Sayeda Hamadari, the girl’s
mother, who is divorced from the cleric, said she wanted her ex-husband
to be put to death, reported The Times.

'I want him killed. I want the full Islamic punishment. This is God’s law,' she said yesterday.

Claims:
It has been alleged that she had also been repeatedly raped and that 
the injuries she sustained from the sexual abuse had been burned

'I am in constant pain when I think 
of what he did to my daughter. I cannot bear to think of it. I have been
reading the Koran to seek some comfort. Only God knows what I am going 
through.'

She is divorced from al-Ghamdi who 
remarried and has two more children, and claims the torture happened 
whilst Lama was in her father’s care in March last year.

It was previously reported that Fayhan al-Ghamdi had been 
released after paying ‘blood money’ to  Lama’s mother.

Albawaba News reported the judge as saying: 'Blood money and the time the defendant had served in prison since Lama's death suffices as punishment.'

But the Saudi Justice Ministry 
responded saying that the cleric was still in prison 
and that the case was continuing. 

The death penalty is thought to be unlikely in this case.

Lama’s stepmother is appearing as a witness to the murder at another hearing tomorrow according to Ms Hamadari. 

Torture: Saudi preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitting beating his daughter with a cable and is said to have been concerned about his five-year-old daughter's virginity

‘My dear child is dead, and all I want
now is justice so I can close my eyes and know she didn't die in vain,’ Sayeda Hamadari told CNN, adding that her daughter was ‘brutally 
tortured in the most shocking ways.’

‘The state needs to even consider taking his two children from him and his wife away because I fear for their lives,’ she added.

'These are not 
some unfounded accusations, but everything is based on the medical 
examination by the hospital and the team of physicians who treated Lama 
when she was first admitted.'

Randa
al-Kaleeb, a social worker from the hospital where Lama was admitted, 
said the girl's back was broken and that she had been repeatedly raped and her injuries burned.

Activists
say under Islamic laws a father cannot be executed for murdering his 
children.

Husbands can also not be executed for murdering their wives, 
the group say.

Three Saudi 
activists, including Manal al-Sharif, who started the women's right to 
drive campaign, have raised objections to the case as it highlights the 
urgent need for legislation to protect women and children from domestic 
abuse.

Manal al-Sharif 
has launched a campaign on Twitter using the hashtag 'Ana Lama', which 
is translated as I am Lama, calling for an improvement on the judicial 
treatment of women and children.

Local
reports say public anger in Saudi Arabia is also growing and 
authorities have said they will create a 24-hour hotline to take calls 
about child abuse.
