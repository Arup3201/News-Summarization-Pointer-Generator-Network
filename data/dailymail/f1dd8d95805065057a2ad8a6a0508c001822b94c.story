An Australian woman has claimed the top prize at a stair climbing competition in Paris, which saw her climb the 1,700 steps up the Eiffel Tower in under 10 minutes.

Suzy Walsham is a professional tower runner and also won a similar race at the Empire State Building earlier this year for the sixth time.

The 41-year-old competed in her first race nine years ago, which was the Swissotel in Singapore.

Suzy Walsham, from Australia, became the the first female winner of the Eiffel Tower climb in Paris

In the first La Verticale de la Tour Eiffel on Friday, Walsham completed the trek in nine minutes and 44 seconds, making her the fastest female in the competition.

The tower runner told Reuters the climb was tough and it became harder as she went higher.

'It was very difficult but I am very happy,' Walsham said.

In another interview, the champion athlete said she liked competing because it challenged her.

'It's a time trial so you won't know how you've done until you get to the top,' Walsham said.

'My aim is to go as fast I can and when I get to the top, enjoy the view.'

The men's winner in the Paris race was Polish man Piotr Lobodzinski who completed the climb in seven minutes and 50 seconds.

He said he would take a second tilt at the title next year.

Walsham is from Australian but now lives in Singapore. She completed February's Empire State Building climb in 12 minutes and 30 seconds

'It was a very nice race and I am happy I am here in the first edition of Eiffel Tower Run,' Lobodzinski said.

'It was quite long... 276 meters vertical, really strong athletes, but I am the winner and so I am really happy, very glad and hope to be back here next year.'

The inaugural event had 57 men and women from 16 countries competing.

Walsham's triumph comes after she conquered the Empire State Building climb in February.

She completed the 1,576-step challenge in 12 minutes and 30 seconds, SBS reported.
