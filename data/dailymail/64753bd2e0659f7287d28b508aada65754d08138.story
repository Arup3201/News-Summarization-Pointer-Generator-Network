The C.I.A. tortured al-Qaeda suspects in the wake of 9/11 in a  bid to prove Saddam Hussein was behind the atrocity so they could justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it has been revealed.

The agency came under immense pressure from George W. Bush's administration to forge a link between the former Iraqi dictator and al-Qaeda as it sought to bolster its argument for war.

But an official 2009 report on detainee abuse - revealed by The Independent - claimed that the increasingly brutal methods of interrogations used to extract confessions yielded no hard evidence to back the theory.

Brutal: The C.I.A. tortured al-Qaeda suspects in the wake of 9/11 in a bid to prove Saddam Hussein was behind the atrocity and therefore justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it has been revealed (pictured: a terror suspect is carried back to his cell following interrogation at Guantanamo Bay)

Excuse for war: The agency came under immense pressure from the administration of then-President George W. Bush (left) to forge a link between Saddam Hussein (right) and al-Qaeda as it sought to bolster its argument for war

The claim came in a dossier compiled by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which quoted former US Army psychiatrist, Major Charles Burney, stationed at Guantanamo Bay as saying interrogators were told to focus on a single line of inquiry.

'A large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq,' he said. 'There was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results'. 

A source  told the McClatchy news agency that there were two reasons for wanting to prove Hussein's involvement:

First, senior White House officials wanted to prevent a second attack and, second, 'for most of 2002 and into 2003, [Vice-President Dick] Cheney and [Defence Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld were also demanding proof of the links between al-Qaeda and Iraq.'

Back from the torture chamber: It follows a US Senate report which cast light on the range of 'brutal' interrogation techniques meted out on terror suspects in the years following the destruction of the Twin Towers

Torture: Waterboarding was deemed acceptable because it didn't cause the lengthy mental anguish needed to meet the legal standard of torture

But when told by the C.I.A. that the programme was producing no concrete results, Cheney and Rumsfeld pushed for tougher questioning.

The source added: 'There was constant pressure on the intelligence agencies and the interrogators to do whatever it took to get that information out of the detainees, and when people kept coming up empty, they were told by Cheney's and Rumsfeld's people to push harder.'

The CIA has defended its conduct by claiming that the relationship between torture and results was 'unknowable,' a claim rejected by the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, who maintained that torture produced nothing of value.

'Push harder': A source said that 'for most of 2002 and into 2003, [Vice-President Dick] Cheney (far right) and [Defence Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld (far left) were also demanding proof of the links between al-Qaeda and Iraq' and demanded interrogators 'push harder' when no evidence was found

In one of several memos forming the legal underpinnings for brutal interrogation techniques, the CIA was told detainee Abu Zubaydah could lawfully be placed in a box with an insect, kept awake for days at a time and slapped multiple times in the face. 

Waterboarding, too, was acceptable because it didn't cause the lengthy mental anguish needed to meet the legal standard of torture, the 2002 Justice Department memo says.

The release last week of a Senate report cataloging years of such interrogation tactics has revived debate about legal opinions since discredited and withdrawn and about the decision to not prosecute the program's architects or officers who used the methods. Civil rights groups in the United States and abroad are renewing calls to prosecute those who relied on techniques that President Barack Obama has called torture.

'How can we seriously use the phrase 'rule of law' if crimes of this magnitude go uninvestigated and unprosecuted?' said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union.

The Justice Department, which spent years looking into the matter, says it lacks sufficient evidence to convict anyone and found no new information in the report. It also is far from clear that any international case could be brought.
