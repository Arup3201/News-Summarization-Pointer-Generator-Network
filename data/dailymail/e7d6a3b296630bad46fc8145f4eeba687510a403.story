Former foreign minister Bob Carr has hit back at claims he was lazy in the job saying he was entirely committed to working around the clock.

Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard made the eyebrow raising comments while talking to channel nine journalist Ray Martin in an interview which is set to be aired Tuesday night.

Martin told Triple M's 'The Grill Team', Ms Gillard unloaded on the former foreign affairs minister and she said that it was a mistake to appoint Bob Carr and when he got there he was 'lazy'. 

'She certainly makes it clear that he didn't like hard work,' said Martin.

Ray Martin says of Julia Gillard's interview 'she certainly makes it clear that he (Bob Carr) didn't like hard work'.

Channel Nine's Ray Martin says he came away from the three hour sit-down conversation with former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, thinking that Mr Rudd was 'pretty treacherous'.

Julia Gillard has accused the former foreign minister Bob Carr of being 'lazy' which has seen the former NSW premier hit back saying he was proud he worked seven day a week in the job

But the former NSW premier has rejected the accusations claiming that had labor stuck with her as leader, many of his friends and colleagues would have lost their seats.

Mr Carr told the Daily Telegraph that his published diaries, contained in a book as his time as foreign minister showed the former PM's claims were wrong.

'the great value of a diary is that it presents the daily reality of life and that's what my diary does, it demonstrates that I was totally engaged in a tough and demanding job'. 

'I'm proud that I worked seven days a week in the job,' he said.

'I flung myself into that job, if for no other reason than I thought I'd only be in it for 18 months,' Carr told the Daily Telegraph. 

Mr Carr believes the claims were entertained by Ms Gillard because of her clear disappointment at him for switching his allegiance to Kevin Rudd before he re took the leadership last year.

'I did so for one reason, it was the very viability of the party we love,' he said. 

'It's also fair to say that 80 per cent of my reflections about her were fond,' Carr told the Daily Telegraph.  

Happier times between Gillard and Rudd but her interviewer told Triple M that 'they all knew how dysfunctional he was and they'd been covering him up'

 

On the night she told Kevin Rudd she would challenge him for the leadership:

The way I tell it in the book is my side of it … you know…a very emotional time, if anything the accusations against me in politics and you still read in the newspapers you know the woman who wielded the knife, if anything the reputation I have from that night is one of political brutality. Actually in the moment I was hesitant, a conversation went too long, I certainly fed (Rudd)hope. I shouldn’t have done that.

On Kevin Rudd after she had deposed him:

I thought his reaction would be one of hurt and acute distress. I know a lot now about what it feels like to lose the prime ministership, so I expected him to feel very, very battered and bruised. Obviously I was wrong about that.

On her decision to campaign as the 'real' Julia:

I put my hand up for that one hundred per cent. That’s my fault you know sort of dumb, dumb error, rookie error maybe. I mean I wasn’t a rookie in politics, I was a rookie at being prime minister.

On the 'odd couple' - her relationship with Tim:

You look at all of that and you say, how much of that is gender working, because would we think it was quite so odd if a male Prime Minister or a male chief executive officer of a big bank or whatever had a wife who worked as a hairdresser? Would we think that was kind of you know really, really odd? Why on earth did he marry her? She’s a hairdresser! I just don’t think it would occur to us. I think it was the gender thing a bit. But in terms of you know being supportive, Tim was there and, yes, there’s the blow-drying of the hair, but there’s so much more.

On why she hasn’t married Tim:

It’s just the right decision for us and the right decision for me. We’ve just been joking about it, the various descriptors you can put on my forehead, I am an atheist, I’m not a person of faith, and so I don’t think about marriage in that religious sense. And I don’t feel that we need you know some ceremony or anything to you know make our relationship meaningful; it is meaningful. So it’s the right choice for us.

On life at The Lodge and Kirribilli:

I’d had no life experience that prepared me for having ah staff around you in that close, intimate sense that staff in The Lodge or Kirribilli are. And I thought there’s only a couple of ways of reacting to this. You could pretend you were poncing around in Downton Abbey or something like that! Or you could just try and embrace it and make it an extended kind of family circumstance.

On same sex marriage:

I’ve got what may be in the modern age a kind of old-fashioned, feminist view about can we, take the traditional institution of marriage and stretch it? Or do you create some other way of solemnising relationships and recognising them as of worth and status. And when I was a young feminist I would’ve said overwhelming the gay community was on that track too, but things have changed! I accept the course of human history now is that ah we are going to see same sex marriage here and in you know most parts of the developed world.

In her first interview since leaving politics, Julia Gillard also took a swipe at the man who saw her end her career in politics. 

Ray Martin told Triple M's 'The Grill Team' that he came away from the three hour sit-down conversation with the former Prime Minister, thinking that Mr Rudd was 'pretty treacherous'.

'There are a dozen books out at the moment, all of which I read in advance of this thing and all about that period of time, that dysfunctional Kevin 07,' Ray Martin said. 

'It's extraordinary, they covered him up for awful long time and it's not just her but they all say the same thing.'

The veteran journalist was asked whether the real Kevin Rudd was hidden from the Australian public.

'Right to the point where she suggests that, at the end, she says she had no choice but to get rid of him,' he said.

'They all knew how dysfunctional he was and they'd been covering him up.

'Certainly she (Julia Gillard) thinks he was heading for an emotional breakdown.'

'The way I tell it in the book is my side of it … you know…a very emotional time, if anything the accusations against me in politics and you still read in the newspapers you know the woman who wielded the knife, if anything the reputation I have from that night is one of political brutality,' Ms Gillard said.

'Actually in the moment I was hesitant, a conversation went too long, I certainly fed (Rudd) hope. I shouldn’t have done that.

'I thought his reaction would be one of hurt and acute distress. I know a lot now about what it feels like to lose the prime ministership, so I expected him to feel very, very battered and bruised. Obviously I was wrong about that.' 

Ray Martin revealed that Kevin Rudd was not the only Canberra connection or high-profile person targeted by the ex-Labor leader.

'She unloads on The Canberra Press Gallery, she says that's one of the things she doesn't miss, almost without exception,' he said.

'Alan Jones gets a fair thumping, in there for probably in her mind with good reason.'

Not all the brickbats are reserved for others.

Julia Gillard accepted full responsibility for her 'real Julia' claim, putting it down as a rookie mistake. 

She admits to Ray Martin that 'I put my hand up for that one hundred per cent. That’s my fault you know sort of dumb, dumb error, rookie error maybe. I mean I wasn’t a rookie in politics, I was a rookie at being prime minister'. 

Ray Martin pointed out that the ex-PM was warm during the interview and that she did not just focus internally, delivering some strong words on the current Prime Minister.

'She's fairly savage on Tony Abbott, as well,' he added.

The former Australian Prime Minister was recently called to give evidence at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Corruption.

During four hours of testimony, Ms Gillard denied having any knowledge of an illegal 'slush fund' and having any role in setting up an account for the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association.

While in the witness box Ms Gillard admitted that she may have done some things differently but added that 'none of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards'.

Julia Gillard now says that appointing Bob Carr as Foreign Minister was a 'mistake' and describes him as 'lazy'. He has countered with 'I think she's saying this because I clearly disappointed her by switching to Rudd'

Tony Abbott does not escape the wrath of Julia Gillard in her sit-down interview with Ray Martin

'It's extraordinary, they covered him up for awful long time and it's not just her but they all say the same thing' according to interviewer Ray Martin

Ray Martin interviewed the former Prime Minister ahead of her book release, My Story.

Up until Monday, much of the detail in Ms Gillard's memoirs had been kept a closely guarded secret.

The interview airs Tuesday night at 6.50 on the Nine Network.
