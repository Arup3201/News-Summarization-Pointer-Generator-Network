A former Microsoft manager who had never even smoked marijuana 18-months ago is planning to turn his budding pot business into the Coca Cola brand of cannabis.

Jamen Shively, a former Microsoft corporate strategy manager said that he envisions his Seattle-based enterprise becoming the market leader in recreational and medical cannabis, just like McDonald's dominates fast food and Starbucks, coffee.

His brand, Diego Pellicer, is named after Shively's great-grandfather, a former U.S. diplomat and the 'dot bong' entrepreneuer is rapidly acquiring medical-marijuana dispensaries across Washington state and Colorado - which he hopes is the start of pots first established international brand.

Shively, 45, whose six years at Microsoft ended in 2009, said he was soliciting investors for $10 million in start-up money and he has already roped in former Mexican President Vicente Fox - hoping to open a 'legal' pot trade between the U.S. and Mexico.

'Let’s go big or go home,' said Shively to the Seattle Times. 'We’re going to mint more millionaires than Microsoft with this business.'

'I’ve just fallen in love with the plant,' Shively told the Times. 'Especially in the medical realm I’ve gone from entrepreneur to advocate to activist, seriously.'

Fox appeared at a news conference on Thursday in Seattle, along with Fox, where he recounted how the war on drugs has ravaged his country and praised the states of Washington and Colorado for voting to legalize the recreational use of marijuana last fall.

'It's a giant market in search of a brand,' Shively said of the marijuana industry. 'We would be happy if we get 40 percent of it worldwide.'

A 2005 United Nations report estimated the global marijuana trade to be valued at $142 billion.

Washington state and Colorado became the first two U.S. states to legalize recreational marijuana when voters approved legalization in November.

Shively laid out his plans, along with his vision for a future in which marijuana will be imported from Mexico, at a Thursday news conference in downtown Seattle.

Joining him was former Mexican President Vicente Fox, a longtime Shively acquaintance who has been an advocate of decriminalizing marijuana.

Fox said he was there to show his support for Shively's company but has no financial stake in it.

'What a difference it makes to have Jamen here sitting at my side instead of Chapo Guzman,' said Fox, referring to the fact he would rather see Shively selling marijuana legally than the Mexican drug kingpin selling it illegally.

'This is the story that has begun to be written here.'

Shively told Reuters he hoped Fox would serve an advisory role in his enterprise, dubbed Diego Pellicer after Shively's hemp-producing great grandfather.

The sale of cannabis or marijuana remains illegal in much of the world although countries mainly in Europe and the Americas have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of it.

A larger number of countries have decriminalized or legalized cannabis for medical use.

Shively acknowledges that his business plans conflict with U.S. federal law and are complicated by regulations in both Washington state and Colorado.

He said he is interested in buying dispensaries that comply with local and state rules and are less likely to attract the scrutiny of authorities.

'If they want to come talk to me, I'll be delighted to meet with them,' he said of federal officials.

'I'll tell them everything that we're doing and show them all our books.'

Furthermore, he paraphrased stoner legend and Star Wars character Obi-Wan Kenobi to sum up his attitude towards the authorities.

On his first experience with marijuana:

How he arrived at marijuana from Cannabis:

Washington state's marijuana consultant, Mark Kleiman, said he was skeptical of Shively's plans, and feared that the businessman is seeking to profit off others' addiction.

'It's very hard for me to understand why
 anybody seriously interested in being in the marijuana business, which 
after all is against the federal law, would so publicly announce his 
conspiracy to break that law,' said Kleiman, a professor of public 
policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the 
U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle, referred questions to the Department 
of Justice headquarters. Department officials did not immediately return
 calls seeking comment.

Washington
 state Representative Reuven Carlyle, a Seattle Democrat, sees promise 
in Shively's initiative. Any industry emerging from the shadows will 
inevitably undergo consolidation - and thereby simplify the task of 
regulators, he said.

'The
 fact that an entrepreneur is publicly pushing the envelope around a 
branding and value-based pricing opportunity, I would say that's in the 
water in Seattle,' said Carlyle, chairman of the House Finance 
Committee.

'That's in our DNA ... We could have predicted that as much as the rain.'

Shively
 said he has already acquired the rights to the Northwest Patient 
Resource Center, a medical marijuana operation that includes two Seattle
 store fronts.

He 
added that he was close to acquiring another dispensary in Colorado, as 
well as two more each in Washington state and California, with the 
owners given the option to retain a stake in their businesses.

'We've created the first risk-mitigated vehicles for investing directly in this business opportunity,' he said.

Shively
 said he ultimately plans to create separate medical and 
recreational-use marijuana brands. Shively said he also plans to launch a
 study of the effectiveness of concentrated cannabis oil in the 
treatment of cancer and other illnesses.
