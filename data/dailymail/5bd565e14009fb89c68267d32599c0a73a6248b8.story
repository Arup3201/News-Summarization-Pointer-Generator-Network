Police have released disturbing images of an arsonist pouring inflammable liquid through the letterbox of an elderly couple and then setting the front door ablaze as they slept.

The attacker can be seen calmly bending down as he pours the liquid, believed to be lighter fluid, through the letterbox while trying to hide beneath a large umbrella.

He then slips to the ground on the pathway in the front garden as he makes his getaway from the house in Wallington, Surrey.

Luckily, the couple, who have not been named by police, had a smoke alarm and were woken.

They managed to get the fire under control with an extinguisher before the flames could spread throughout the house.

Despite their heroic efforts, the front door was damaged beyond repair and the walls and ceilings in the hallway were left blackened by the smoke.

Sutton CID say the attack on the morning of November 1 was 'seemingly motiveless attack' and are appealing for witnesses.

The person in the video tried to shield his face with a large golfing unbrella as he carried out the attack.

Police say the suspect is a white man who was wearing a golf-style raincoat, baggy trousers, possibly over the top of other trousers, and thick gloves.

DC Emily Marshall, of Sutton CID, said: 'Please come forward if you saw a man of this description in the area...Â  or if you have seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area recently.'
