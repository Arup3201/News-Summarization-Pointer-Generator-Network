Saido Berahino has thanked his mum for helping him earn a senior call-up to the England national team by assisting him on his 'long journey'.

The West Brom striker has been rewarded for his early season form by Roy Hodgson after scoring eight goals in 13 games for the Baggies.

Berahino moved to England when he was 10 as he was granted asylum to leave his native Burundi.

When asked by BBC Radio 5 live about his path to the England national team set-up, Berahino replied: 'Growing up wasn't easy and I wasn't the easiest kid to handle but she was always there for me.

'My mum and I have had a long journey. She has always been there for me and sometimes been tough with me to get me back on track.

'We have come from nothing. I have got to where I have because of her help.

'Now we have achieved something together and I can share this moment with her.'

Berahino will be hoping he can win his first senior cap for the Three Lions during England's upcoming matches against Slovenia or Scotland.

The 21-year-old has scored eight goals in 13 games for the Baggies so far this season
