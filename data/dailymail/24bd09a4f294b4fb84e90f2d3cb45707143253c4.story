The family of Anni Dewani cannot move on with their lives or grieve properly until her husband answers questions in South Africa over his alleged part in her murder, they say.

Shrien Dewani is flying to South Africa tonight to face trial over the charge of conspiracy to murder after his final appeal against extradition on the grounds that he is not fit to stand trial was turned down.

Appearing on ITV's This Morning programme, Anni's brother Anish Hindocha and her cousin Amit Karia described the effect that her murder and the subsequent legal battles has had on their family.

'You think that time will heal but it doesn't,' said her brother Anish.

'We can't move on with our lives, it's been very difficult at home, we just talk about the case all the time rather than about Anni. We want to get justice for her and we will fight everyday to get it.'

He added: 'Sometimes I call my father at four or five in the morning and he's 
awake - he can't sleep, I can't sleep, it's all we're thinking about . 
Our minds are thinking of it every single day. It's like a tumour in our
 heads - you just can't get rid of it.'

The body of newlywed Anni Dewani, 28, was found on the back seat of a car in Cape Town, South Africa in November 2010 after she and her husband Shrien had taken a drive through a slum district one evening during their honeymoon.

The pair were allegedly held at gunpoint 
while in their taxi and Shrien was thrown from the car. His bride was 
found murdered the next day in the abandoned taxi with a single gunshot 
wound to her neck.

South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting Mrs Dewani and jailed for life at the end of 2012.

Prosecutors claimed he was hired to carry out the killing and say that Shrien was responsible, a charge he denies.

The couple's taxi driver, Zola Tongo, was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Shrien has denied murder and has been compulsorily detained in the UK under the Mental Health Act after being diagnosed as suffering from severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

He lost his final battle against extradition last month and is being flown out to South Africa this evening. A medical examination will judge whether or not he is fit to stand trial.

Said Anni's cousin Amit: 'It's been three 
and a half years and we still haven't got the answers. Her parents 
light a candle every single day. They can't move on or grieve unless they have the answers.'

The family will fly out to South African for the trial if Shrien is judged mentally fit for a court case to proceed.

Asked about Shrien, who the family haven't seen since Anni's funeral, Anish said: 'There
 have been lots of rumours and speculation but we just want a court to answer 
them.

'He has a lot of questions that he needs to answer. We want the 
trial to get started and then we will hopefully hear what he has to say.'

Anni Dewani's father Vinod Hindocha has long campaigned for the truth to come out about his daughter's death

More than three years after her murder, her husband Shrien is being extradited to South Africa to face trial

The thousands of messages 
of support that the family have received since Anni's murder and 
throughout the long legal process has really helped, they said.

'Anni
 has become a daughter of everyone in South African and Britain,' said 
Anish. 'We have received so many messages of support as a family and we 
would have struggled much more without them.'
