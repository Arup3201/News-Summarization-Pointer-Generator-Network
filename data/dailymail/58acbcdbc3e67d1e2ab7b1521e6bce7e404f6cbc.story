A British skier has died after falling and hitting his head on a rock in front of his son in the French Alps.

The accident happened yesterday afternoon in the resort of La Clusaz, on an 'easy' blue run.

The 51-year-old, who has not been named, fell around 17 feet before hitting his head.

‘He suffered a serious head injury and was evacuated by emergency helicopter,’ a local police spokesman said.

The man was rushed to hospital in nearby Annecy, but died from his injuries soon afterwards.

Gendarmes have launched an inquiry, and are liaising with members of the deceased man’s family, the police spokesma added.

It was in the French Alps resort of Meribel that, on December 29th, Formula 1 motor racing star Michael Schumacher fell and hit his head on a rock.

Accident: It was was while skiing in the French Alps last December that Michael Schumacher suffered the brain injury that keeps him in intensive care

Despite wearing a helmet, Schumacher suffered a traumatic brain injury and remains in intensive care.

Earlier this month, Schumacher's agent reported that he was showing 'moments of consciousness' as he was gradually withdrawn from the medically induced coma.

Schumacher’s helmet, which was split in half, is said to have saved his life.
