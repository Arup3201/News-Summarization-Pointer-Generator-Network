Jimmy Wales said a European Court ruling allowing people to have links removed from the search engine's index was 'open-ended' and the law was 'confusing'

Web giant Google must not be put in charge of 'censoring history', the founder of Wikipedia warned today.

Jimmy Wales said a European Court ruling allowing people to have links removed from the search engine's index was 'open-ended' and the law was 'confusing'.

The UK government has insisted it does not amount to a 'right to be forgotten' and likened to ruling to Communist China.

The purge of search results ordered by the court applies only to Google's local search pages covering the EU's 28 member nations and four other European countries, encompassing more than 500 million people.

But users in Europe who switch to the firm's American domain, Google.com, will find unaltered search results.

The 'right to be forgotten' is based on the premise that outdated information about people should be removed from the internet after a certain time.

But after links to stories started disappearing, Google performed a u-turn and began reinstating some of them.

Google has so far received about 91,000 such requests since the ruling came into force.

Mr Wales, who co-founded the free web encyclopaedia Wikipedia in 2001, said: 'The law as it stands right now is quite confusing. We have this one ruling of the ECJ which is very open-ended and very hard to interpret.

'I would say the biggest problem we have is that the law seems to indicate Google needs to censor links to information that is clearly public - links to articles in legally published, truthful news stories,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'That is a very dangerous path to go down, and if we want to go down a path where we are going to be censoring history, there is no way we should leave a private company like Google in charge of making those decisions.'

He added: 'I can't speak to the position of the company - I am on an external board advising Google, coming up with recommendations for search engines generally, coming up with recommendations for Parliamentarians as to how to reform the law.'

Mr Wales went on: 'There is a sense that one of the big philosophical problems with the approach that has been taken is that the idea of personal data is so broad under European law, almost anything about a person is considered to be personal data - including that the Prime Minister is married; that is personal data about the Prime Minister.

'What we need to do when we talk about protection of consumers... we talk about companies having information and needing to handle it in an appropriate way - we are talking there about private information, your health records, your financial information. That's a completely different category.'

Labour MEP Claude Moraes, chairman of the European Parliament civil liberties committee, agreed that the law is 'confused' which is based on 1995 data protection laws.

'That is ancient law as far as technology is concerned - mobiles were around in 1994. That tells you where we were.

'What is currently blocked is the new data protection law which talks not about a right to be forgotten, but a right to erasure. What we need is clarification of the law.'

Earlier this month Lib Dem Justice minister Simon Hughes argued that people do not have an ‘unfettered’ right to demand the removal of links to internet articles containing information about them. 

He added: ‘We have criticised the government of China... for closing down people's right to information. There are other countries with strict information access.

‘It is not a good position for the EU to be in to look as if it is countenancing restrictions in the access of the citizen to access to information because it could be a very bad precedent.’
