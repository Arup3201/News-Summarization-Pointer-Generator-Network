Boiling temper: Claude Bosi (pictured), Chef at the Hibiscus restaurant, called a food blogger a c*** after he gave the restaurant three stars out of five

After the starter he was served at Mayfair's Hibiscus restaurant wasn't to his taste, food blogger James Isherwood gave his meal a run-of-the-mill three out of five rating.

But the review - one of 12 posts on his blog called Dining With James - left a bad taste in the mouth of head chef Claude Bosi, who took strong exception to the average rating.

The two-star Michelin chef took to Twitter to  launch a bizarre tirade of abuse at Mr Isherwood - even suggesting that she should have had the 'balls' to tell him he didn't like the meal while he was at the restaurant.

Mr Bosi, a widely-regarded and highly-reviewed chef, wrote: 'Nice way to gain respect with chefs...!! I think your a C*** and this its personal sorry...!!'

He went on to ask Mr Isherwood if he had enjoyed his meal, to which he responded yes, he had.

So Bosi ranted: 'As a man you should say something to my face when I ask, Please buy yourself a pair of balls and play with them.'

The culinary community on Twitter picked up on the exchange and also started abusing the blogger, who gave a glowing review to Tom Kerridge's Hand and Flowers gastropub.

But Mr Kerridge a two-Michelin-starred chef, wrote: 'Now your just being a c***! #notwelcomeinanyrestaurantever! #bellend seeya dickhead' [sic].

He followed up with 'Smash him in chef Bosi #chefsunite' and 'Who is this guy??? What a loser!!'.

Claude Bosi opened Hibiscus in London in 2008 after moving the restaurant from Ludlow in Shropshire

Dining with James: Isherwood criticised the restaurant in his blog

Then Sat Bains, another two Michelin 
star chef with a restaurant in Nottingham dived in: 'Heard a really good
 saying once, and it rings true today!!!! @claudebosi @ChefTomKerridge 
there is a c*** amongst us.!!!'.

Mr Isherwood deleted his account soon after.

His blog, however, still carries the review, with the offending paragrpah reading: 'I started with crab, Rose hip and crab apple sorbet, fresh walnuts. The crab came wrapped in breadcrumbs but they were so over cooked, it was just like a crab flavoured Findus crispy pancake, with the smallest dollop of puree, it's role on the plate was irrelevant.'

Bosi opened Hibiscus in Ludlow, Shropshire, in 2000. Within a year he had won a Michelin star, and in 2004 he was awarded a second.

The restaurant closed in April 2007 as he looked to move nearer to London,with Bosi saying: 'I'm transferring Hibiscus, not starting a new restaurant. The idea is to continue and build on what I have been doing.'

The timing of the move gave Michelin inspectors only had two weeks to visit the restaurant, meaning Bosi lost his second star in 2008.

In 2009, Hibiscus placed second to 
The Fat Duck in UK National Restaurant of the Year Awards. Laster that 
year Hibiscus' second Michelin star was restored.

The exchange infuriated Guardian food
 blogger and professional chef Luke Mackay, who blasted his fellow cooks
 for their outbursts.

He 
wrote: 'All of you made me ashamed to be a chef last night, you made be 
ashamed to be on Twitter and you have done nothing but bad for our 
industry. 

'Yes we know a 
restaurant lives or dies by its reviews... but calling a paying customer
 a "c***" on a public forum for not liking his starter?

'If
 you demand the respect of your customers you are a self-important idiot
 who has positioned the art of cooking up there with fighting in the 
trenches or treating the sick. 

'It's not. It's cooking. I do it, you do it, and my 90-year-old nan does it. It's just cooking.'
