MP Eric Joyce stocked up on expensive computers and charged them to the taxpayer before quitting his Commons post, it has been claimed. 

The politician, who was convicted of assault in 2012 after headbutting a fellow MP in a bar, claimed an astonishing £185,635 in expenses last year, new figures have revealed. 

Among the items he charged to the taxpayer was £1,777 of 'replacement laptops' and £125 on accessories from the Apple shop.

Eric Joyce claimed almost £2,000 in 'replacement laptops' and £125 on accessories from the Apple Shop despite agreeing not to seek re-election next year

Mr Joyce will be able to keep the technology despite agreeing to refrain from seeking re-election in 2015.,' the Sun reports. 

The 54-year-old was thrown out of the Labour party after being arrested for headbutting Tory MP Stuart Andrew in a House of Commons bar. 

In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. 

He was fined £1,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. 

Joyce, who previously earned the nickname 'Britain's most expensive MP' refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics. 

The MP for Falkirk was asked to leave the Labour party following the 2012 scandal. A former army major (right), Mr Joyce has agreed not to seek re-electon following a colourful career in politics 

Under the new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority rules, the watchdog does not consider it 'cost effective' to recover items such as those expensed by Mr Joyce in recent months. 

Their ruling was slammed by campaigners, with John O'Connell of the Tax Payer's Alliance saying: 'Ipsa look more clueless by the day. We've got to crack down on this kind of wasteful spending.'
