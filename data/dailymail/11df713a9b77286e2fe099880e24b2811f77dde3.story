While its competitors are shelling out $4million for 30 second spots during Sunday's Super Bowl, Chipotle Mexican Grill will be paying $1million for a four-episode TV series that only mentions the restaurant once.

Next month, the Denver-based fast casual chain will release a new series called 'Farmed and Dangerous' on Hulu, which promises to be a satirical take on industrial farming.

No scenes will be filmed at Chipotle restaurants and there will be no lines about how delicious their burrito bowls are as the brand steps takes native advertising into original programming.

Instead the series is designed to subtly draw attention to the fact that Chipotle promises to use wherever possible meat and dairy from animals raised without antibiotics or hormones and organic produce.

Bosses hope message that will make consumers naturally gravitate to their restaurant.

The series will include four 30 minute episodes and star actor Ray Wise as Buck Marshall, a man who works for farmers who are planning to feed cows petroleum pellets to lower costs.

In a subtle nod to the chain, the hero will be named Chip, a young man dating Mr Marshall's daughter.

'"Farmed and Dangerous" is meant to strike large emotional chords â€” itâ€™s not about selling burritos,' Daniel Rosenberg, a former Hollywood executive whose company, Piro, produced the series with Chipotle, told the New York Times.

Mr Rosenberg says the process for producing the show was no different than for any other TV show. His agent took the idea to Hulu, and screenwriter Jeremy Pikser (who wrote the film Bulworth) was brought in to pen the scripts.

On Hulu, the show will be called a 'Chipotle original series' but it will exist right next to all their other television shows.

The company's executives say they have no problem putting it on the site because of the high-production quality.

Like all Hulu shows, there will be breaks for advertisements, and some of the ads will be for Chipotle.

But the only time the restaurant will be mentioned during the show is in a line clarifying that Chipotle is not, in fact, owned by McDonald's.

Their message: The company previously produced short animated videos backed by popular musicians, promoting a return to simple farming

The restaurant has been struggling to disassociate itself from the fast food giant which had a controlling stake in the company until 2006.

Since its inception, the company has prided itself as a restaurant that serves 'Food with Integrity'.

On their website, Chipotle promises to use - whenever possible - meat and dairy from animals raised without antibiotics or hormones and organic produce.

'Farmed and Dangerous' will cost the company $250,000 an episode, and could go on to have multiple seasons and distribution overseas.

This isn't the first time that Chipotle has gotten innovative with its advertising.

Last year, the company produced several short animated videos promoting a return to simple farming and their new app game, featuring music by Willie Nelson and Fiona Apple.

Since being founded in 1993, the company has expanded to $1,500 and is worth more than $15billion on the stock market.
