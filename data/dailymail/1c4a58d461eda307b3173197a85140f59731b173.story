A popular health blogger who reportedly failed to donate $300,000 in profits to charity has now admitted she was 'wrong' about the extent of her terminal cancer.

The Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson, whose app has about 200,000 followers, claims she was 'misdiagnosed' by a doctor after announcing last year that life-threatening cancer had spread to her live, uterus, spleen and blood, The Australian reports.

The 26-year-old, who became a social media sensation when she launched her hit lifestyle and recipe app after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, says she feels 'humiliated' after a German medical team's examination led her to announce she was battling a third and fourth cancer.

The latest revelations come just a day after it emerged that Ms Gibson may have misled her followers by failing to donate 25 per cent of the profits from The Whole Pantry - totaling $300,000 - to charity, despite promising she would.

Belle Gibson, 26, the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry recipe and health app, publicly said $300,000 in profits would go to charity, but they never did

There have also been revelations that Ms Gibson was dishonest about her recent medical history and told people she was again riddled with cancer, later claiming she had been 'misdiagnosed' 

Ms Gibson, who shunned traditional treatments to combat her cancer and instead opted for a wholefood and holistic approach to battling the disease, said she was confused by her misdiagnosis.

'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong... (I felt) confused, bordering on humiliated', Ms Gibson told The Australian. 

She revealed a medical team from Germany had examined her using 'magnetic' therapy and believes this investigation led to her misdiagnosis, although she declined to name the medical team. 

In July 2014 she broke the news of her illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal Instagram page. It read in part: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer. 

'One is secondary and the other is primary. I have cancer in my blood, spleen, brain, uterus, and liver. I am hurting,' Ms Gibson wrote.

Around 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up her initial post, revealing she was undergoing 'German integrative oncology protocol'.

'I'm following the same, yet amplified holistic medicine treatment plan, taking what I need from each respected modality; herbalism, acupuncture, nutrition etc and a new addition to it all with a German integrative oncology protocol. It took me a while, but I'm back in (adjusted) full force and taking each day as it comes.'

On Monday Fairfax Media revealed Ms Gibson had not delivered on her promise to donate 25 per cent of The Whole Pantry's profits to charity, and reported she had lied about donating $300,000 in funds to a number of organisations. 

The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app

Ms Gibson has almost 200,000 followers on her personal Instagram account, who she has kept updated on her health and progress over the past few years.

However there appear to be a number of inconsistencies in her medical history, age, and some recent ailments. 

The Australian reported that in 2009 she claimed to have undergone multiple heart surgeries where she died on the operating table, and months later was told by a doctor she had terminal brain cancer which left her only four months to live.

She has said publicly that she was 20 at the time, but other documentation has indicated that she was born in 1991, meaning she was 17 in 2009.

Many of Ms Gibson's social media postings from recent years have been removed, and her Instagram account is now private. 

Furthermore, when The Whole Pantry took to Facebook on Monday to defend the company, they appeared to be deleting comments questioning the validity of Ms Gibson's illness and business plan. 

The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app.

At least five charities who purportedly had money raised for them through a number of campaigns run by Ms Gibson never saw any funds.

The app, which has been downloaded over 300,000 times, proved so popular she was flown out to Silicon Valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the Apple Watch.

The 26-year-old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business' profits were being donated to charity, last year claiming that $300,000 had been donated.

However Ms Gibson told Fairfax Media this week that those donations had never been made, citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins.

Neither Melbourne's Asylum Seeker Resource Centre or One Girl - who were donated $1000 after questions were raised - received any money from Ms Gibson initially and the former claimed that it wasn't aware money was being raised in its name.

'In late 2013 The Whole Pantry advised One Girl that they would be fundraising on our behalf in an online fundraising event,' Chantelle Baxter, CEO, One Girl told Daily Mail Australia in a statement.

'In early 2015 One Girl approached Belle Gibson from The Whole Pantry to enquire about when a donation would be made to One Girl and how much was raised from the fundraising event.'

She has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app

Ms Baxter said One Girl received a response from The Whole Pantry last week, which coincided with initial media inquiries into the business and they 'have since made a donation of $1,000 to One Girl.'

'Since this donation One Girl has asked The Whole Pantry for confirmation of the total amount raised through the online event and are awaiting their response,' Ms Baxter added.

Apparently only $7000 in total has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated. 

Penguin, the publisher of Ms Gibson's book which was launched off the back of her app's success said they did not see it necessary to seek confirmation on the entrepreneur's medical history or age during their dealings with her.

'Penguin did not seek or receive documentary evidence of Belle's medical condition or birth date prior to publication,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

'We did not feel this was necessary as The Whole Pantry is a collection of food recipes, which Penguin has published in good faith. 

'We are concerned about the questions raised in recent days - we'll discuss them with Belle as ultimately only she can answer the questions,' the spokesperson added.

There were also revelations that neither the business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises, a situation that could lead to huge fines and potential jail time. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Whole Pantry for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing, they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing some of claims made in the original article. 

There have been revelations that The Whole Pantry business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises

Ms Gibson has appeared across a number of networks (pictured on Sunrise) speaking about her approach to healing

In the post to their Facebook page the company clarified they were a 'for-profit' company and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry.

'We have, like all start ups, struggled with managing all facets of a new business, biting off more than we could chew, juggling internal and external priorities with little staff. 

'We have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external Business Manager and Accounts team, an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses.

'They have been working over our finances for the last five months, and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight. We were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward,' the post read in part.

'Our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated. TWP forecasted income in October 2014 which was not fulfilled, creating cash-flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations,' another section of the post read. 

By citing 'cash flow issues' as Ms Gibson did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations, the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commentators.

Last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new Apple Watch

Apparently only $7000 of a projected $300,000 has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated

'Appalling - your organisation not the media. Money for charity doesn't go into 'cash flow' - that is beyond unethical, surely it's illegal?', one angry subscriber posted.

'You have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response. YOU took money from people who GAVE you the money believing it would go to said charities, you FAILED to forward on the money,' another poster wrote. 

'... That my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures. SHAME on you,' the comment continued.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Belle Gibson, The Whole Pantry, and a number of the charities who were to receive donations, for comment.
