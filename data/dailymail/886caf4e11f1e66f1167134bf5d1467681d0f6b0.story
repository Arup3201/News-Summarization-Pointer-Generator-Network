A disabled army veteran was shocked to open a letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs which declared him dead.

James Fales, who served 11 years and now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, was killed off inside the department's computer system, which triggered the ill-timed letter of condolence.

His wife, Dorothea, was named on the from of the message, sent to their home in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

Condolences: The letter, pictured above in a local TV broadcast, gave instructions for dealing with Fales's supposed death - then asked for any uncashed checks back

It offered consolation and instructions related to his supposed death - and also told her to hand back his benefit payments.

The letter, which ended with an address to send U.S. Treasury checks to rather than cashing them, also explained costs to do with his funeral.

Speaking to Fox News about the mix-up, Fales said: 'At first, it was kind of a shock; then it became humorous, to a point.'

However, he added that the mix-up has had real-world consequences, as it has interfered with payments he usually receives from the department.

He added that the error highlighted a problem in the government's bureaucracy, as while once branch of the VA thought he was dead, another was still calling him about medical appointments.

As well as PTSD, Fales is also being treated for an ankle injury, local station KFSM reported.

The Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks, which treats Fales, issued an apology after the mix-up.

A spokesman said: 'We do apologize and regret that this error has occurred, and want to reassure our Veterans that we will work diligently to assist them in any way we are able to in order to resolve the issue.'
