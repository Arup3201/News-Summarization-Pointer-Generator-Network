What do Louis van Gaal and Paris Hilton have in common? The pair have both just been nominated for the Ice Bucket Challenge by Yolanthe Sneijder-Cabau, the wife of Dutch footballer Wesley Sneijder.

Cabau, a model and TV presenter, joined the millions of people taking part in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge on Friday, and passed the challenge on to the Manchester United manager.

If he accepts, Van Gaal will be following the example of several of his United players, including Marouane Fellaini, Shinji Kagawa and new signing Marcos Rojo.
