Older women are fuelling a middle-age travel boom, using their landmark 50th birthdays as a reason to head off the beaten track for  adventurous holidays in exotic locations, a survey has found.

Many are ditching lazy beach holidays and relaxing cruises in favour of treks to far flung destinations - and they are increasingly willing to backpack, and go solo.

The study of 3,500 British women, found 42 per cent are more confident about travelling when they get older and are keen to step out of their comfort zone.

Older women are fuelling a middle-age travel boom with increasing numbers jetting off to exotic, far-flung locations on their own, a survey has found

A quarter want to explore more remote places around the globe and meet new people. And four per cent are after a physical challenge.

According to the research, conducted by clothing company Cotton Traders, almost half (42 per cent) say they feel more daring about travel in their forties and fifties.

And three quarters (74 and 78 per cent) said a beach break or cruise would no longer be their first choice of holiday.

As a result more than half (52 per cent) have already been away on their own, with 15 per cent) making a solo trip in the last year and 12 per cent in the last five years.

Another one in 20 (six per cent) haven't taken the plunge yet but would like to join the Far Flung Fifties Club sometime soon.

One in four women said the focus of their trips in their forties and fifties was exploring somewhere remote 

How they spend their holiday also reflects this new-found sense of adventure.

One in four (22 per cent) said the main focus of their trip was exploring somewhere remote, while 26 per cent were keen to meet new people.

A further (four per cent) wanted to get stuck into some kind of physical challenge on their travels and three per cent were planning volunteer work. As a result they are willing to head further afield.

While traditional destinations like Europe and North America are still attractive, more exotic climes are gaining in popularity too.

Almost one in 20 (four per cent) named South East Asia as their favourite place to get away from it all, while a curious one per cent said East Africa or South America were their top travel picks.

And wherever we travel, we seem to be doing it in some style -  with one in eight splashing out more than £3,000 and another one in four working to a £1,000 annual budget.

The number of trips we take isn't insubstantial either. The majority (79 per cent) regularly travelled overseas twice a year, while a lucky 17 per cent took four foreign breaks each year.

And although FFF love travelling solo, when they do take a plus one, their partner tops the list of holiday companions named by 77 per cent as the person they'd like to share the experience with.

Shona Jameson, Head of Marketing and eCommerce at Cotton Traders, said: 'For many women middle-age is the perfect time to travel and reaching the 'Far Flung Fifties' often prompts people to look for more exciting, more fulfilling places to visit.

'Often these FFF are women who have already raised a family or achieved a lot in their careers so want more interesting leisure time too. 

'They're inspirational bunches who want to try new things, share their life skills and enjoy quality time for themselves and with loved ones.'
