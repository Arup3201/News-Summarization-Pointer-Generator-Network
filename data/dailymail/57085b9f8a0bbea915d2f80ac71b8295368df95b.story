Freeman Burkholder will leave several children behind when he goes to jail Friday for his part in the hair and beard-cutting scandal against other Amish

Amish schoolchildren held their end-of-school celebration early yesterday so their parents could attend before they are jailed for beard-cutting.

Nine members of the Ohio Amish sect led by Samuel Mullet Sr are already in prison after being convicted of the hate crime against rival followers, and five more will join them this Friday.

Four women and one man will start jail terms of between one and seven years, leaving nearly three dozen children without one or both parents for the duration of their sentences.

They were convicted of cutting off the hair or beards of fellow Amish in a campaign of assaults said to have been orchestrated by the leader of the breakaway sect Mullet Sr.

The incidents are considered deeply offensive in Amish culture as the beard is considered a symbol of manhood and faith.

Usually the Amish settle disputes within their communities, but in this instance the police were involved because of the seriousness of the assaults, in which victims were said to have been pinned down, screaming, as their beards were hacked off by 'howling' aggressors.

Yesterday's end-of-school celebration was brought forward from its usual date at the end of April so that the convicted parents could spend some time with their children before going to jail.

Men played baseball in buttoned shirts, work boots and blue pants with suspenders. Their wives, some barefoot, sat on simple wooden benches and chatted, their long-sleeved, blue and green dresses and white head scarves fluttering in the wind. Their children relaxed nearby, dressed like smaller versions of their parents.

'It's
a happy day on the outside, but not on the inside. On the inside, a lot
of times we're crying, but we have to keep our spirits up for the 
children's sake,' said Martha Mullet, whose husband, Sam Mullet Sr, was 
accused of orchestrating the hair-cutting attacks and was sentenced to 
15 years, the longest term of the 16 defendants in the case.

She said that she believes the government is trying to split up the community but that the members are determined to remain on their current property.

Glimpses from the news media are limited in Amish communities, but the members of Mullet's group in Bergholz said they were open to sharing their story because they feel they've been treated unfairly by the justice system.

Amish, who shun many facets of modern life, are deeply religious and believe the Bible instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry, which means cutting the hair would be shameful and offensive.

The defendants don't deny the hair-cuttings - some say they regret what happened, others don't - but contend they stemmed from family disputes that should have been handled internally.

They say that they are bound by different rules guided by their religion and that the government had no business getting involved in what they did.

'We're not exactly saying it was wrong, and we don't say it's right, either. ... It's something that will never happen again, I can tell you that,' said Wilma Mullet, a daughter of Sam Mullet Sr. who was not charged.

All 16 defendants have appealed, arguing that the group's conviction, sentencing and imprisonment in separate facilities as far away as Louisiana, Minnesota and Connecticut violates their constitutional rights and amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, an argument prosecutors reject.

The defendants say the distance to the facilities is too great to travel by horse-drawn buggy or even by using a hired driver, so most of their families likely won't be able to visit.

The five reporting to prison on Friday said they're scared and not sure what to expect, but they're hopeful about being released early for good behavior.

They're sewing clothes, plowing ground and finishing other chores to make life easier for their loved ones who will remain in the community. Two women were bracing for their first plane ride, to prisons in Minnesota.

Their departure will leave nearly three dozen children without at least one parent, and some without both because their fathers already are incarcerated, so the adults have made alternative arrangements.

In some cases, older siblings will look after younger ones. The spouses and 15 children of two defendants, Anna Miller and Freeman Burkholder, are merging under one roof while they serve their one-year sentences.

Lovina Miller is beginning a similar sentence and giving Martha Mullet custody of her eight children until she returns because her husband is in Massachusetts on a seven-year sentence.

The case has shocked the Amish in America and shone a light on their strictly traditional ways

Before the trial, the Amish rejected plea agreements that offered leniency and could have helped some of the young mothers avoid prison.

Several said yesterday that they rejected those deals, either because they didn't want to admit guilt to a hate crime charge or they didn't want to testify against Mullet Sr. and say things they don't believe.

The community members say they're working together to ensure the group perseveres by handling home repairs and various chores that would have been the responsibility of the incarcerated members, with the remaining men especially bearing the burden of extra work.

Among them is the 19-year-old grandson who took over running Sam Mullet Sr.'s 700-acre farm.
