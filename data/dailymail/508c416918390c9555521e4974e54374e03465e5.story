Britain will have to import millions of worms to help restore farmland devastated by floods, experts have warned.

Stuart Fripp, an agronomist advising farmers on the Somerset Levels, said: ‘We’ve been digging holes in a lot of land that was flooded and we haven’t found any worms at all.

‘They’ve been killed by the weight of the water, which removed all the air from the soil so they could not breathe.’

And Professor David Jones from Bangor University, who has been inspecting the flooded fields on behalf of the Government, said: ‘The soil quality on farms affected by flooding is really bad.

'Earthworms are a central part of our ecosystem. But they have disappeared from certain areas and in other places numbers have decreased.’

Worms in the soil show that the ground is healthy enough to allow plants to grow, providing food for insects and small mammals.

Without these smaller creatures, birds and larger animals like foxes are deprived of their food source.

James Winslade, who runs an 850-acre farm near Bridgwater in Somerset, said: ‘There are no worms, so we’re going to have to find some to put back.

‘I’m doing everything to get the soil back into condition. I just want to get it back to how it was but it’s going to take years.’

Matt Shardlow, from charity Buglife, recommended collecting worms from local meadows and introducing them into fields affected by flooding.

But one of the country’s leading worm suppliers, Nigel Baker, pointed out that farmers would need 24,000 worms to restore an acre of farmland – which would cost £2,000.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is increasing the maximum grants for farmers to help their land recover from floods from £5,000 to £35,000.

A spokeswoman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘There is nothing to stop farmers using this cash to buy new worms.’
