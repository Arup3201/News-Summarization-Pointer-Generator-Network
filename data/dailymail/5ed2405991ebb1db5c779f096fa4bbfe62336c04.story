What would make the perfect Christmas present for the Prime Minister after the week he has had?

A photo frame for the latest selfie? A beginner’s guide to contempt of court? A shopping spree to spend his £7,400 MP’s pay rise?

In fact David Cameron has revealed he has much simpler tastes and is looking forward to some peace and quiet over the festive break.

And some squidgy tennis balls.

New balls please: Tennis fan David Cameron has revealed he wants squidgy tennis balls for Christmas

In recent days Mr Cameron has found himself making headlines for all the wrong reasons.

News outlets around the world carried pictures of him posing for a selfie with the Danish Prime Minister and US President during Nelson Mandela’s memorial service.

And today he has been rebuked by a judge for backing TV cook Nigella Lawson in an ongoing court case.

But as he come under fresh pressure to reject a planned 11 per cent pay hike for MPs, the Prime Minister has admitted that he hopes that the Christmas holidays will bring some respite from his frantic schedule.

Mr Cameron, a keen tennis fan, said he had started playing the sport with his son Elwen, seven, and wanted balls that would not travel too far when you ‘really whack’ them.

Speaking to BBC Coventry and Warwickshire about what he wanted for Christmas he said: ‘A bit of peace and quiet would be quite a nice thing but you can never bank on that in this job.’

He added: ‘I want some squidgy tennis balls. I have started playing tennis with my son.

‘I would like those ones which you can really whack and they don't go very far.

‘If Santa's listening, you can get them down the chimney pretty easily and there will be a very happy recipient at the other end.’

Mr Cameron was yesterday forced to 
defend his decision to pose for a light-hearted ‘selfie’ in the middle 
of Nelson Mandela’s memorial service – by claiming he was only being 
polite.

The
Prime Minister said the snap with U.S. President Barack Obama and 
Danish leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt was proof that even in death 
Mandela was ‘bringing people together’.

Miss
Thorning-Schmidt is the daughter-in-law  of former Labour leader Neil 
Kinnock, and when she asked for a group photo it was ‘it was only polite
to say yes’, Mr Cameron told MPs.

Mr Cameron was challenged over the 
photo at Prime Minister’s Questions by Liberal Democrat MP Martin 
Horwood, who asked him: ‘Has the Prime Minister had the opportunity to 
discuss international mobile phone usage with any other European heads 
of government over the last day or so?’ 

To laughter from MPs, Mr 
Cameron replied: ‘You could say, in a roundabout way. Perhaps in my 
defence, you should always remember that the television cameras are 
always on.

‘But in my 
defence I would say that Nelson Mandela played an extraordinary role in 
his life and in his death in bringing people together.

'So of course when
a member of the Kinnock family asked me for a photograph, I thought it 
was only polite to say yes.'

The polite thing to do: David Cameron has defended posing for this selfie during Nelson Mandela's memorial service, saying it was proof the late leader was still 'bringing people together'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also came to Mr Cameron's defence today.

Speaking on his radio phone-in on LBC 
97.3, Mr Clegg said: 'I know some people aren't happy about it. I think it was
a bit of friendly light-hearted joking around by the three of them. I 
personally don't feel that people should be too censorious about it at 
all.'

He added: 'It was a 
very celebratory atmosphere, it was a real celebration of the man's 
life. There was dancing, there was singing, the crowd was in a very 
jubilant mood.

'So it wasn't as out of keeping with the setting as I think some people have suggested.'
