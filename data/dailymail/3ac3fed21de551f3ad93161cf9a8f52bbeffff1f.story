Carlos Vela has ended the prospect of a return to Arsenal this summer by agreeing a new deal with Real Sociedad.

His previous contract expired in 2016, but their club website have announced that the Mexican has signed an extension that will now last a further two years.

Vela arrived at Sociedad for a season-long loan in 2011, before signing permanently for the club a year later.

In that time he has scored 47 goals, and registered 28 assists in 128 games, with 21 of those coming last season.

Vela started his career at Arsenal, making his competitive debut there in 2008, and speculation had mounted that he may be returning to London this summer - especially as Arsene Wenger looks to step up his pursuit for a striker to compliment Olivier Giroud.

But it now appears that the 25-year-old will remain in La Liga for the foreseeable future.
