This sickening CCTV footage shows three yobs batter a helpless shopkeeper with a baseball bat and hurl a vodka bottle at him. 

The thugs are filmed strolling into the newsagents before launching a frenzied attack on the defenceless 30-year-old worker. 

One of the men rips the baseball bat out of his accomplice's hands and is caught hitting the victim five times in succession. 

Such is the brutality of his actions, his fellow thugs even seem shocked and at one point, try to take the bat from him. 

After the horrifying assault, one of the yobs throws a glass vodka bottle at the worker's head, causing it to crack on impact.
