An 11-day-old  baby injured in a motorway crash has died in hospital today, police confirmed.

The newborn boy was airlifted to  Birmingham Children's Hospital shortly after the collision on the M6 at 4.25 pm on Sunday.

The baby's mother, four-year-old sister and 18-month-old brother were alsoÂ 
injured in the collision near Cannock yesterday, but have already been 
discharged from hospital.

Busy motorway: The two cars crashed on the M6, near Cannock in Staffordshire

The family had been travelling in a grey Seat Leon when the car collided with a silver Mercedes C-Class on the Southbound carriageway in Staffordshire.

Two air ambulances and fire crews attended the scene between junctions 10 and 11.

Two of other children from the Seat had to be airlifted to hospital with the baby, where all three received emergency treatment in the helicopter en route.

Airlifted: The baby was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital on Sunday afternoon but he died from his injuries

The man and woman travelling in the Mercedes were also taken to hospital as a precaution.

Staffordshire Police have
arrested a 30-year-old man from Solihull on suspicion of dangerous 
driving.

He has been bailed pending further investigation. The police are appealing for witnesses.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
