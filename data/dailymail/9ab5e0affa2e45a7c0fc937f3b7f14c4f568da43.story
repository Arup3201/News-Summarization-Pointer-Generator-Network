Just like on Aussie soil it's a debate that has been brewing across the ditch as well.

New Zealanders will get to vote twice over the next two years on whether the country should change its flag.

The New Zealand government announced that next year, voters will choose their favourite alternative flag from among several options, and in 2016, they will vote on whether that alternative should replace the current flag.

Some residents in New Zealand consider the current flag to be an unwanted relic from a colonial past and too similar to Australia's flag, while others, including many combat veterans, feel a deep attachment to it.

The current flag features the Southern Cross star constellation with Britain's Union Jack in the canton, or top left corner.

Prime Minister John Key favours a change and promised to hold a vote if he was re-elected for a third term in September. 

And he did, his National Party storming to victory in a decisive win.

'Our flag is the most important symbol of our national identity and I believe that this is the right time for New Zealanders to consider changing the design to one that better reflects our status as a modern, independent nation,' said Mr Key on Wednesday.

When Mr Key first raised the idea of a flag vote in March, he said he favoured changing the design to a silver fern set against a black background.

It's an image that's popular among New Zealand's sports teams, including the national rugby squad, known as the All Blacks and the nation's netball squad called the Silver Ferns.

The government said several alternatives will be chosen for next year's vote by a panel of 'respected New Zealanders' who will be nominated by a group of lawmakers from all political parties.

The Prime Minister estimated the two votes would cost $26 million New Zealand dollars which is more than $23 million AU.

Australians have also been subject of the flag debate for many years.

There is the repeated question of whether we should take away the union jack and/or the southern cross, and make a complete change to the flag.

The debate often arises with the subject of whether Australia should become a republic, although that idea was rejected in 1999, when a referendum kept the monarchy. 

But while the flag debate has been well talked about, the question has never actually been put to a vote. 

Not only New Zealand but Australia has been having the flag debate for years, which often arises with the subject of whether Australia should become a republic or not
