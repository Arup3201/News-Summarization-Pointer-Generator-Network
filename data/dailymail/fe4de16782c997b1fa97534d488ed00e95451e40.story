A mother accused of the murder and neglect of her baby after she left him in her baking hot car for seven hours will go on trial today.

Dr Karen Murphy, 40, from Virginia, was arrested in June last year after the body of her two-year-old son Ryan was found strapped into his car seat, where she had left him that morning.

Murphy, a mother-of-three who owned a large veterinary practice, usually dropped Ryan at nursery on her way to work.

Accused mother: Karen Murphy will go on trial today accused of the murder of her son after she left him in a hot car for seven hours

Vehicle: Murphy is accused of leaving her baby son in this minivan for seven hours where he died from the baking heat

But on June 17, when she got home at 4pm, she received a panicked call from her husband to say Ryan wasn't at the nursery when he went to pick him up.

When she went to her car, Murphy found her son still strapped into the car seat where she had left him that morning.

The mother is accused of leaving him in the searing hot car for seven hours while she was at work. He died from heatstroke.

Her trial begins in Bristow, Virginia, today where she is accused of child neglect and murder.

If convicted she faces a maximum of 40 years in jail.

According to NBC, the June 17 incident was not the first time she had forgotten her son in the family's minivan.

According to a search warrant, Murphy left her son unattended in the 
vehicle outside work for about 20 minutes, and only realized he was 
there when someone from the day-care center called Murphy to report her 
son was absent.

Karen Murphy was described as a 'pillar of the community' and a loving devoted mother

Murphy was described as a pillar of the community and was active in the local girl scouts group with her two pre-teen daughters.

Since her arrest, many friends and family have rallied around her, calling her a devoted, caring mother who made a tragic and inexplicable mistake.

At her previous court hearings, groups of supporters gathered outside the court.

Her attorney will argue that the loss of her son and the guilt she will have to carry for the rest of her life is enough punishment.

Edward MacMahon said: 'This was a tragic accident and not a crime.

'What she needs is to be supported and loved by the people who know and care for her and who know what a wonderful mother she is.

'In my judgment, she doesn't need to be prosecuted. She's doing everything she can to continue to be a good mother.'

Family home: Murphy discovered the body of her son in the back seat of her car after she returned home from a day at work

Prince William Commonwealth’s Attorney 
Paul B. Ebert, who has pursued cases in which children were forgotten in
 cars referred to as Forgotten Baby Syndrome, said though what she did may have been accidental, her
 actions and inactions rose to the level of crimes.

He said: 'It certainly wasn’t intentional. But the fact is that she
 was on notice.

'This is an innocent child, and she wasn’t up to speed on
 taking care of him. It gets to the point where it becomes neglect.'

His decision to take the case to a grand jury was due to the fact Murphy had done this more than once.

Family and friends have written messages of support on a Facebook page, which says: 'This page is a place to share your support for the loving, caring and compassionate mother Karen Murphy is.

'We cannot begin to imagine the devastation and grief the Murphy Family is experiencing since the passing of their precious son Ryan.'
