Teachers have to spend months ‘socialising’ children when they start primary school in how eat, mix with other pupils and go to the toilet, an education minister has warned.

Growing numbers of youngsters start school aged four with ‘very challenging social skills’, Lord Nash said.

Eight in 10 staff at nurseries and primary schools say they have had to deal with children who have wet or soiled themselves.

All four to seven-year-olds in England will be given free school lunches from September as part of moves to improve the eating habits of new pupils.

Lord Nash, the minister for schools, said teachers and classroom assistant, were now spending ‘several terms’ helping children from chaotic families to adapt to school life.

Lord Nash said: ‘We unfortunately see an increasing number of pupils entering primary school with very challenging social skills. 

‘Primary teachers and assistants have to spend several terms socialising them.

Lord Nash, the Schools Minister, said pupils teachers were having to deal with more pupils with 'challenging social skills'

‘Meals are very important, which is why we have introduced compulsory meals.’

He
 said the government was investing ‘substantially’ in early years 
training and would continue to support childminders in particular in 
helping to prepare children to start school.

Last month a survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers found school support staff were increasingly having to deal with pupils who have not been toilet trained by the age of four.

Lord Nash was responding to a question in the House of Lords from Labour peer Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe who asked for the government to produce statistics on ‘the number of children who are now going to school who cannot eat properly, have not been toilet trained properly and cannot cope with healthy foods by comparison with what they are accustomed to eating’.

He also asked what the Government is doing to ‘help parents to train those children to make sure that they have a better standard and to stop the closure of the Sure Start centres, which were aimed at trying to prevent that difficulty’.

Teaching leaders warn the problem of pupils who are do not know how to go to the toilet or feed themselves was adding to the workload of staff.

Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL, said last month: 'Having to deal with increasing numbers of pupils who have not yet been toilet trained puts extra pressure on education staff when they already have enough pressure on them.

'It is worrying that such a high number of support staff have received no training in dealing with such issues, yet they are expected to deal with pupils, and even though it is not formally within their job description.'

Dr Bousted added: 'Schools need to give staff clear 
guidance on how to deal with toileting accidents so they know what they 
are allowed to do and who should be dealing with an incident.

'It
 is also important that education staff feel they have support from 
their school nurse or head, and that they know where to obtain guidance 
should they need it.'

A survey published by ATL in 2012 found that almost two-thirds of primary school staff say they have seen an increase in youngsters having accidents during the school day over the past five years.

This figure rose to 71 per cent among teachers working with three to five-year-olds.
