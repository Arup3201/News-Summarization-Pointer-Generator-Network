The £11.99 champagne and £2.65 smoked Scottish salmon are flying off the shelves.

Such bargain-priced delicacies have tempted so many new shoppers through Lidl’s doors that the discount supermarket has coined a name for them – Lidl-class.

And a quarter of its customers are now middle or upper middle-class, joining families facing squeezed budgets in Lidl’s aisles.

Bargain-priced delicacies have led to a wave of 'Lidl-class' shoppers - middle and upper middle-class customers - who are swayed by the likes of £11.99 champagne and £2.65 smoked salmon

‘The public are changing their minds about us,’ Ronny Gottschlich, UK managing director of the German-owned firm, said in an interview carried in the Mail’s City pages today.

He said the new Lidl-class shoppers have been wooed by ‘the introduction of our deluxe lines, the fresh lines and the Britishness of our business’.

Sales rose by a fifth in the space of a year and will pass £4billion this year, the company will announce today as it unveils a £20million advertising campaign.

Lidl has taken shoppers away from Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, according to specialist research firm Kantar.

The Comte de Senneval champagne at £11.99 and smoked salmon at £2.65 for a 200g pack have helped, while Lidl has just launched a womenswear range including a biker jacket that isn’t real leather, but costs only £14.99 and has had glowing reviews.

Lidl expects to have sold out of the entire first batch of women’s clothing, which only went on sale over the Bank Holiday weekend, by today. A men’s range is expected in November.

The discounter wants eventually to more than double the number of its stores from 608 to almost 1,500 across the country.

More than half of its produce is sourced from around the UK, and it estimates that £1.75billion of its sales are of British goods.

Lidl now holds 3.6 per cent of the market, while fellow cut-price chain Aldi has 4.8 per cent. Kantar said 53 per cent of families have visited a Lidl or Aldi store in the past 12 weeks. In the past 12 months, Lidl’s share of the market has risen by 18.3 per cent, while Aldi’s has grown by 29.5 per cent, according to Kantar.

Sales at Tesco fell by 4 per cent compared to a year earlier as Britain’s biggest supermarket continued to shed market share. Tesco’s hold on the market fell from 30.2 per cent to 28.2 per cent.

Sainsbury’s share fell from 16.5 per cent to 16.4 per cent while Morrisons slipped from 11.3 per cent to 11 per cent. But Asda, which has introduced a ‘Price Lock’ on everyday items, increased its share.

Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital bank, said: ‘The Big Four retailers were taking their customers for granted through much of the economic downturn by depending upon inflation for sales and over-protecting margins. Unfortunately, the shoppers sussed their trading strategies out and went elsewhere.’

Kantar said a supermarket price war had pushed down food price inflation which now stands at 0.2 per cent, its lowest level since October 2006.
