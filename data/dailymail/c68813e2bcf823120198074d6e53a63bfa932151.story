Mark Allen played brutal hardball as he swatted aside Belgian teenager Luca Brecel at the Coral UK Championship.

The 28-year-old Northern Irishman, runner-up at the York-staged tournament three years ago, beat Brecel 6-0 at the Barbican Centre to clinch a place in the third round.

Allen has been a beaten finalist in the Shanghai Masters and International Championship already this season and has his sights on a major prize, which is why he did not want to give 19-year-old Brecel the slightest chance of an upset.

Neil Robertson took his cricket bat along to the match in honour of Phillip Hughes

'I had a game plan to not take on any silly shots against Luca,' said Allen.

'He's not the sort of player you want to let build up confidence.

'He's a very streaky player and I knew if he got a few frames on the board he'd be hard to stop.'

Allen refused a number of pots he admitted he might have taken on against other opponents, preferring to put Brecel in trouble.

'I turned down a couple of tricky ones early doors, I didn't miss many when I was in the balls, and I made it hard for him really,' Allen added.

Robertson carried out a cricket bat along with his cue as a tribute to compatriot Phillip Hughes

'I didn't really want to give him any sniff into the match easily, I wanted to make him work for it and I feel I stuck to my game plan well today.'

Also in the main arena, defending champion Neil Robertson carried out a cricket bat along with his cue for his match against Kyren Wilson, paying a tribute to fellow Australian Phillip Hughes who died on Thursday.

Robertson was finding his match a struggle against Wilson, who took the sixth frame after a re-spotted black to square the contest at 3-3.

Meanwhile, Ronnie O'Sullivan confirmed he would be in evening action against Leeds potter Peter Lines.

The four-time UK champion has a broken ankle and suggested after a first-round win over Daniel Wells that he may have to withdraw from the tournament, but O'Sullivan wrote on Twitter he was 'gonna give the ankle a go' against 44-year-old Lines.
