The United States is probing major banks over possible manipulation of precious metals markets, it has been reported.

The investigation centers on prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium.

It is being carried out by the Justice Department with help from Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates raw materials and derivatives.

The banks probed by the US government over possible manipulation of precious metals markets include HSBC, Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Standard Bank and UBS

The banks targeted are HSBC, Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Standard Bank and UBS, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The probes are at the preliminary stage, but HSBC, in releasing yearly results Monday, noted requests from the Justice Department and the CFTC over the precious metals probe, the Journal said.

HSBC was one of several banks named in lawsuits filed in U.S. courts last year alleging a conspiracy to manipulate gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices, as well as precious metals derivatives, during the daily precious metals fixes.

The century-old gold fix is a standard price for the metal that banks set twice a day over the phone. Some gold traders claim they were harmed by a scheme to manipulate the fix.

The banks operating the precious metals benchmarks, known as the fixes, said last year they would no longer administer that process.

An electronic daily silver price benchmark is now administered by Thomson Reuters and CME Group, while the London Metal Exchange provides twice-daily benchmark platinum and palladium prices.

ICE Benchmark Administration will run an electronic gold price benchmark from March 20 to replace the London gold fix.

Switzerland's financial watchdog said in November it had found a 'clear attempt' to manipulate precious metals price benchmarks.

An investigation by German regulator Bafin found no signs of attempted benchmark price manipulation in precious metals, newspaper Handelsblatt reported last month.

HSBC is currently mired in a scandal surrounding allegations that the bank helped wealthy clients dodge taxes.

It said past practices at its Swiss private bank were 'unacceptable' as it reported that 2014 net income fell 16 percent to $13.7billion.

HSBC acknowledged Monday that 2014 profits 'disappointed' and said the figures included the costs of paying settlements to cover past failings. 

These include $550million the bank set aside last year to cover penalties for manipulating foreign currency markets.
