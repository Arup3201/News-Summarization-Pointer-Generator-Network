In a world of instant communication, where you can easily find dates online and share intimate pictures in seconds, barely a day goes by without someone being 'caught out' with an illicit image to the wrong person.

Just this week we've seen Kelly Brook's (now ex) man David Mcintosh accused of sending inappropriate messages to an ex and Conservative MP Brooks Newmark was forced to resign from his post as Minister for Civil Society after he sent pictures of himself in paisley pyjamas to a reporter posing as a woman on What's App.   

Is sexting cheating? Kelly Brook dumped fiancé David McIntosh over his alleged texts to ex-girlfriend 

It's hardly the first time a celebrity has been involved in such scandal. In 2010, Vernon Kay hit the headlines after he was accused of sending x-rated texts to glamour model Rhian Sugden, but his wife Tess Daly decided to stand by him.

In the same year, the comedian Jason Manford stepped down from his presenting role at The One Show when he was caught out exchanging sexy Twitter messages with a female fan - he and his wife have since split. 

But what are the guidelines on sexting? Is it cheating if you don't make physical contact? 

The subject has fired up debate with This Morning's Agony Aunt believing that sending suggestive messages to another person while in a relationship should always be avoided. 

Speaking on the ITV show today, she said: 'Adultery is not necessarily the end of a relationship, neither is sexting.

'Is it a good idea though? No it is not. 

'I am on the end of receiving letters, and I get them in droves, it seems to be a compulsion.

'Now you can play out your fantasy on the internet, but it's not just a fantasy.

'Partners feel that something that should be intimate has been shared with someone else.

'I remember talking to a man who had been caught in flagrante on the internet and he said to me in injured tones that he was only mucking about - it's this schoolboy and schoolgirl idea that it is only mucking about, but it isn't.'

However, it's easy to see how both women and men can get confused, because while for many sexting is a clear violation of a relationship, for others it is just a bit of harmless fun.  

Journalist Sally Windsor who was also speaking on today's This Morning episode believes that people shouldn't be punished for a few suggestive messages if their partner finds out. 

She said: 'I think there is a threshold here that hasn't been crossed, I don't think it is anywhere near as bad.

'He (Brooks Newmark) shouldn't be punished. 

'Had he crossed the line and something had gone on, then yes, he should be punished.

'But we shouldn't put digital cheating on a par with actual cheating. It's not ideal, but is it the end of a relationship? No.

'I think everybody does it or has done it at some point. 

'He may have done that, taken a step back and realised he had gone too far.  

'What about things like emoticons and writing 'xxx', where do we stop if we call this adultery? If we're saying that this is digital cheating.' 

Finding some middle ground, Sexpert and MailOnline columnist Tracey Cox believes that all couples need to clearly define where their lines in the sand are before a relationship gets serious. 

That way both parties know if they are doing something wrong.  

She said: 'Everyone has their own definition of what constitutes cheating - which is why you need to spell out, specifically, what counts as infidelity for you when you're in a monogamous relationship. 

In 2010, Vernon Kay sent racy texts to glamour model Rhian Sugden while still married to his wife Tess Daly (left)

'I always tell people, ask yourself this 'What would my partner think, if they could see me right now?', doing whatever it is they're doing. 

'If their partner wouldn't like it, consider it cheating.

'Even though there's no physical contact, sexting is still sharing intimate, sexual words or images with someone other than your partner. 

'So yes, it is cheating, though I think most of us would prefer it to cheating in person - though neither are ideal!'
