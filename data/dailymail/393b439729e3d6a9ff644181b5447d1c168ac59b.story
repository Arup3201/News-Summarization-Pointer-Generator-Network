A Premier League footballer was handcuffed by police after being wrongly accused of stealing a tub of £1.85 soft cheese from Tesco.

Queens Park Rangers defender Steven Caulker had left the Express store in Weybridge, Surrey and was about to go back in when he was handcuffed by officers.

Witnesses say they heard the officers and the 22-year-old talking about the cheese spread Philadelphia.

It is thought police spent five minutes with the player before he was released.

One passer-by who saw the incident told the Sun: 'Caulker had left the Tesco Express then turned around and gone back in.

'That was when the police car arrived, jumping from their squad car and handcuffing him.'

While another added: 'There were a group of lads watching from across the street who immediately recognised him - and thought it was hilarious.'

However, Surrey Police confirmed that no crime had taken place. 

A force spokesman said: 'It appears to have been a misunderstanding between staff about payment.'

A spokeswoman for Surrey Police said that the incident involving Mr Caulker, pictured, was due to a misunderstanding between staff about payment  

Both Mr Caulker and QPR refused to comment.

He had been arrested in 2011 during his time at Swansea during a night out in the city on suspicion of a public order offence.

He later claimed he was arrested for swearing in the street and apologised to the club and then-manager Brendan Rogers for his behaviour.

He also added that he had learned from the incident and said it wouldn't happen again.

While playing for the England under-21 team in December 2012, Mr Caulker was caught up in a mass brawl that broke out at the end of a game against Serbia following accusations of racial abuse.

He faced the threat of police action following the incident in Krusevac but was then handed a two-match ban, which on appeal was rescinded.

It is thought that police spent five minutes with the former Cardiff City defender before he was free to go 

The defender, who is originally from Hounslow, west London, began his career at Tottenham Hotspur. 

He also had loan spells at Yeovil Town, Bristol City and Swansea City before joining Cardiff City. 

Mr Caulker, an England international, made his move to QPR in the summer after also being chased by Crystal Palace.

He made the £8million transfer from Cardiff City, despite Palace matching the fee and offering wages of around £42,000 a week.

But it is thought he opted to join the west London club when they bettered the terms.
