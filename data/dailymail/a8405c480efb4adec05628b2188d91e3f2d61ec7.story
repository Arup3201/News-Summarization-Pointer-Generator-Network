The mother of a four-year-old boy who died in a hospital embroiled in a cancer care cover-up has condemned  the NHS trust’s failings.

Mackenzie Cackett died of a brain tumour after a series of appalling delays to his treatment at Colchester General Hospital.

Yesterday, a damning report into care at Colchester revealed several patients like Mackenzie may have died after enduring lengthy waiting times for treatment.

Poignant: The Duchess of Cambridge paid a bedside visit to Mackenzie Cackett in March 2012 - two months before died of a brain tumour after a series of appalling delays to his treatment at Colchester General Hospital

Police have been called in over claims staff were ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ by managers into covering up the extent of the crisis.

Two months before Mackenzie died, a touching picture was taken of him with the Duchess of Cambridge, who visited him in a nearby hospice.

The extraordinary suggestion by the healthcare watchdog, the CQC, is that officials falsified data to make it look as if crucial targets were met.

Some desperately ill patients were forced to wait up to four months for urgent cancer care.

Last night Mackenzie’s mother Danielle Uren said it was ‘terrifying’ to think how many cancer patients might have suffered.

‘The thing is, it wasn’t just Mackenzie,’ she said. ‘It is upsetting. What else will come out of the woodwork? It is scary.’

Series of blunders: Mackenzie with his father James Cackett and his mother Danielle Uren. They believe their son may still be alive today had it not been for delays to his diagnosis and treatment for cancer at the hospital

Colchester Hospital has admitted 
making ‘administrative errors’ in Mackenzie’s case which meant crucial 
appointments were never made and the little boy’s diagnosis and 
treatment was delayed.

But 
it was only yesterday – after the publication of the damning report – 
that the family from Halstead, Essex, learned that the problems went 
much deeper.

The CQC said 
the records of 22 patients had been changed to cover up the fact they 
had faced ‘extensive’ delays for treatment – which could have put their 
lives at risk.

Some were facing delays of almost four months for 
life-saving treatment.

Government
guidelines state patients should wait no longer than 31 days for 
surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy after their doctor has decided on 
the best course of treatment.

The
investigation also found that staff had been ‘pressured, bullied and 
harassed’ to change figures on cancer waiting times to meet government 
targets.

This is the text of the letter from the Duchess of Cambridge after she learned of Mackenzie’s death:

Dear James and Danielle

   I was so desperately sorry to hear the devastating news about Mackenzie’s death.

   It was an incredible honour to have met Mackenzie when I came to The Treehouse earlier this year, and I was totally bowled over by his courage, his strength of spirit, and his brilliant sense of humour.

   I will remember very fondly his love of Sponge Bob Square Pants, and his gorgeous smile, which never seemed to leave his face.You have my deepest and most heartfelt condolences,

Catherine 

Mackenzie’s parents believe he may still be alive had it not been for delays to his diagnosis and treatment.

Miss Uren took Mackenzie to the A&E department in September 2010 because he was vomiting and complaining of headaches.

But although he was given blood tests and an X-ray, no follow-up appointments were made.

Further administrative blunders led to
a crucial scan of his head and spine being delayed for four weeks and 
he was eventually diagnosed with cancer in February 2011 – seven months 
after first going to the GP.

And when his symptoms returned in September 2011, doctors initially dismissed them as unrelated and sent him home.

He was diagnosed with the secondary tumour in January 2012 after he woke up paralysed – within four months he was dead.

Just two months before he died in May last year, Mackenzie was visited by the Duchess of Cambridge at his hospice.

She
was said to have been ‘touched’ by his plight, and after he died she 
wrote a moving letter of condolence to his family, telling them she had 
been ‘desperately sorry’ to hear of his death.

‘Mackenzie
is just another statistic as far as the hospital is concerned,’ Miss 
Uren said in February.

‘The treatment by Colchester Hospital has caused 
so much upset and guilt. They have avoided blame and it’s unacceptable.’

At risk: Staff at Colchester Hospital University
NHS Foundation Trust said they were 'pressured' into changing patients'
data to imply they were treated within national guideline

'Shocking': Sir Mike Richards, left, chief inspector of hospitals, urged Monitor, the foundation hospitals watchdog, to put Colchester University NHS Trust in special measures. Trust chief executive Gordon Coutts, right, issued an apology to patients who did not receive the 'high quality of care they should have expected'

The
CQC found that at least three of the 22 patients whose records were 
changed waited more than 100 days for treatment, including one who 
waited 126 days.

Although 
Mackenzie is not one of the patients identified in the report, the 
hospital has launched a separate investigation into his death over 
concerns that ‘administrative errors’ led to delays in diagnosis and 
treatment.

Patients suspected of having cancer who have been referred by their GP should wait a maximum of two weeks to see a specialist, according to the NHS cancer strategy set out in 2011.

Cancer patients should wait no more than 31 days from the decision to treat their cancer to the start of their first treatment, such as chemotherapy, which should then be delivered within the following 31 days.

This means all patients should wait no more than 62 days from their urgent GP referral to the completion of the first phase of their treatment.

When hospitals are unable to treat patients within the target timeframe they have a duty to investigate and offer alternative hospitals.

Professor Sir 
Mike Richards, the Government’s chief inspector of hospitals who is 
based at the CQC, said: ‘It is shocking to think that people’s lives may
have been put at risk for the sake of the waiting time figures.

'If
you are diagnosed with cancer you are entitled to think that your 
hospital will do all they can to ensure you get treatment you need as 
soon as possible.’

The CQC spoke to three members of staff who were asked by bosses to change figures on waiting times.

Sir
Mike has urged Monitor, the watchdog for foundation hospitals, to put 
the Colchester Hospital University NHS Trust in special measures which 
would see it being taken over by a hit squad.

If Monitor agrees, the organisation will become the eighth foundation trust to be taken over following concerns of poor care.

It
is rare for the CQC to refer a hospital trust to the police and they 
are called in to investigate only the most serious cases.

Trust
chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts said: ‘We are very concerned by the 
findings of the CQC report.

'We are truly sorry that in some cases cancer
patients, their carers and families have not always received the high 
quality of care that they should have expected from our trust.’

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Christina McAnea, Unison's national secretary for health, said  union members blew the whistle.

She said: 'They were admin workers,
bullied by managers into falsifying data.

'I think this is serious enough that it does merit a police
investigation.

'We think there should be police investigation – and a
complete change in way junior members of staff are spoken to. This is about people in every pay grade in hospital speaking
out when things go wrong.'

Bernard Jenkin, MP for North Essex, added:  'The chief executive was aware of whistle blower, and thought it had been dealt with. He deeply regrets and apologises for the fact he didn’t personally pursue it. 

'Why have we got a health service in which people feel justified falsifying records to make things seem better?

'We mustn’t replace values with targets.

‘This is a terrible indictment of the culture that has grown up in the health service over a long time.

‘There's no escaping from the fact that this is completely inexcusable, everyone acknowledges that.'

Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Gordon Coutts said it was 'regrettable' that a 2012 internal review failed to address the issues.

'This report is awful reading. I want to apologise to patients because we have let them down by having these delays,' he told BBC Radio Essex.

'Yes, there was an investigation carried out by two members of my executive team at the time - in February of 2012 - and that review was not adequate.

'It wasn't robust enough and it didn't go deep enough and that is regrettable.'
