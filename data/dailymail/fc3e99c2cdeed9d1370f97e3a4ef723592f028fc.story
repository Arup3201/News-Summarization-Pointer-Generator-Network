Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain uncorked a scathing attack on anti-war protesters who interrupted an Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday, earning applause by barking, 'Get out of here, you low-life scum!'

Activists with the far-left pacifist group CodePink stood with banners when former secretary of state Henry Kissinger entered the room, accusing him of committing war crimes during his tenure as America's top diplomat and as the national security adviser.

They shook handcuffs in his face and chanted 'Arrest Henry Kissinger for war crimes' while McCain, who chaired the hearing about global threats to the U.S., sat dumbfounded and embarrassed.

Sen. John McCain uncorked a tirade against CODE PINK activists who chanted 'Arrest Henry Kissinger for war crimes!'

Calm: Kissinger, 91, remained in his chair throughout the protest, which saw handcuffs being waved at him

Intervention: As the angry group approached the front of the hearing to get close to Henry Kissinger, George Schultz got to his feet to remonstrate with them

Salute: George Schultz, 94, and Madeleine Albright, 77, both rose to their feet to applaud Henry Kissinger as the protesters were removed

Kissinger has long been accused by liberals of presiding over war crimes in Cambodia and Laos during the Vietnam War. 

He presided over America's withdrawal from the conflict and won the Nobel peace Prize for his efforts.

McCain became visibly angry on Thursday when police weren't on the scene immediately to remove the protesters from the hearing chamber.

'Could I ask our Capitol Police to help instill order here? You know, someone find out where the Capitol Police is?' he asked from his spot on the dais.

'You know,' he told the group of pink-clad agitators, 'you're going to have to shut up, or I'm going to have you arrested.'

One man, being escorted from the room by a uniformed cop, shouted something back at the senator.

'Get out of here, you low-life scum,' McCain replied before the audience erupted in applause. 

McCain offered an apology to Kissinger for the distraction.

'I've been a member of this committee for many years, and I have never seen anything as disgraceful and outrageous and despicable as the last demonstration that just took place,' he said.

'ARREST HENRY KISSINGER FOR WAR CRIMES!': Part of the left's historical narrative casts Kissinger as a criminal for helping expand the Vietnam war to neighboring Cambodia and Laos

Young and angry: Two of the anti-Kissinger protesters who had their palms painted red to imply that the former secretary of state had blood on his hands for his actions in office

Capitol Police eventually removed the protesters and McCain apologized for the disurbance

Accusation: The Code Pink group campaigns against any military involvement overseas and says Henry Kissinger should be prosecuted for civilian deaths in Cambodia

Sitting protest: Some of the group stayed in their seats as the demonstration went on and displayed red hands

Power trio: Henry Kissinger, George Schultz and Madeleine Albright were asked in front of the committee to give their views as former secretaries of state

'From all of my colleagues ... I'd like to apologize for allowing such disgraceful behavior towards a man who served his country with the greatest distinction. I apologize profusely.'

When Kissinger began to speak, the remaining protesters erupted a second time.

His fellow former secretary of state George Schultz, who also testified, stood to salute him as more applause ensued – which drowned out the CodePink members.

'I salute Henry Kissinger for his many contributions to peace and security,' Shultz said.

McCain praised Kissinger as someone 'who served his country with the greatest distinction.' 

The group, Code Pink, claims to be an organization for women to oppose 'the global militarism'.

It claims it is 'rooted in a network of local organizers, online supporters and generous donors, with an emphasis on joy and humor'.

And it says: 'Our tactics include satire, street theater, creative visuals, civil resistance, and directly challenging powerful decision-makers in government and corporations. And of course, wearing pink.'

Its next planned event is to protest at a screening of American Sniper in Hollywood. The movie has attracted criticism from anti-war activists over its portrayal of the conflict in Iraq, but been a huge box office hit. 

McCain said in a statement after the hearing: 'Code Pink's typical protest tactics include interrupting Congressional hearings with chanting and sign-holding, which while disruptive and improper, do not represent a threat to witnesses. 

'What happened today was far different. As Dr. Kissinger entered the hearing room to take his seat, a group of Code Pink protesters rushed up to the witness table to confront him, waving handcuffs within inches of his head. 

'Some senators were concerned enough for Dr. Kissinger's safety that they came down off the dais to support the witnesses. With no U.S. Capitol Police intervening, the episode went on for several minutes.' 

CodePink is embracing their latest nickname as delivered by Sen. John McCain on Thursday
