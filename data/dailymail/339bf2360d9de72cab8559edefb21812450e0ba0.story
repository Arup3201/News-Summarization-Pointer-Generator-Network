A blind fashion designer who lost his sight in a horrific attack as a teenager has told how he overcame his nightmarish childhood to gain critical acclaim on the Parish fashion scene.

Mason Ewing has been blind for half his life following savage abuse from relatives, but was determined to realise his dream of working at the height of the fashion world.

Now, despite only being able to see vague shapes and colours, the 30-year-old has become an accomplished designer in Paris - and has even revealed plans to conquer Hollywood.

Impressive: Mason Ewing has become a fashion designer despite being blind

Cameroon-born Mason creates elaborate dresses by describing his detailed designs to a team of artists, while his heightened sense of touch allows him to feel his creations and differentiate between materials.

According to the Los Angeles Times, he has found that his blindness enhances his ability to distinguish between the textures of silks, lace, linen and cotton.

And since overcoming his horrific childhood, Mason has launched his own t-shirt line and even completed his first fashion show in the French capital in 2006.

Mason became inspired by fashion aged just four, after watching Naomi Campbell and other supermodels on the catwalk as a young boy.

However, after his mother was murdered when he was a child, Mason was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in Paris aged six, and he was subjected to vicious beatings.

The budding fashion designer was abused throughout his childhood, culminating in an attack where he was punched and kicked, causing a seizure which left him in hospital.

Dream: Mason's next aspiration is to make it in the world of Hollywood

When he woke up, Mason found he had lost his sight, and he was placed in a series of foster homes by French authorities.

Undetered though, Mason went on to study physical therapy at college, before deciding in 2001 he wanted to pursue his dream of fashion design.

Other budding designers had been skeptical of his ability to succeed in the highly-competitive fashion world, but Mason was backed by a French organization for the handicapped, Agefiph, who financed his first show in 2006, according to reports.

Mason has since created a line of t-shirts featuring a multi-ethnic cartoon character, Baby Madison.

His t-shirts feature raised braille so that he can tell what colour the garment is and what image is printed on it.

And after launching his own t-shirt range, Mason plans to now create his own televised teen drama.

Mary E. Fry, a producer and casting director for independent films who is helping Mason realise his dream of creating a television series, told the LA Times: 'I grew up in an era of Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder and I know what they've accomplished.

'He'll have people at his side that are his eyes and ears. His biggest challenge is getting investors in line.'
