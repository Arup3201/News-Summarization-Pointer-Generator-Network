This was just the second time in three years England manager Roy Hodgson has dared to venture to the Stadium of Light but on the evidence of this sour stalemate he will not be back.

It was not just the Three Lions contenders — Saido Berahino and Jermain Defoe — who failed to impress; every player on the pitch was as desperate as the next.

Referee Mike Jones and his assistants were equally inept, failing to send off West Brom’s Joleon Lescott early in the game and later denying Sunderland a legitimate goal.

The draw — Sunderland’s 13th of the Premier League season — has done little to ease the pressure on Black Cats boss Gus Poyet, who this week wrote to the fans asking for their support.

But the Uruguayan did have reason to moan about some first-half refereeing. The game was just five minutes old when Lee Cattermole sprung Danny Graham clear on the shoulder of Lescott and, under minimal contact from the recovering defender, the striker flopped to the turf.

Referee Jones waved play on, only for assistant Constantine Hatzidakis to flag for an infringement.

Lescott, then, would surely have to go. Jones, though, opted to show a yellow.

The officials were again the centre of attention when they disallowed Adam Johnson’s goal on the stroke of half-time. Ricky Alvarez crossed to the far post where the winger — played marginally onside by Craig Dawson — poked in.

Poyet said: ‘It’s onside. I understand why he gave offside, but it was a mistake.

‘I was more disappointed with the Lescott one. If you make the decision it’s a foul then it should be a red card.’

But Baggies boss Tony Pulis said: ‘I’ve seen old women in the high street take more of a knock and stay on their feet.’

West Brom, though, barely mustered a shot on goal with Berahino failing to impress in front of Hodgson. Pulis added: ‘Saido has been fantastic for us but he took a knock early in the game and struggled. He’s had better days.’

As has everyone who had the misfortune to be at the Stadium of Light.
