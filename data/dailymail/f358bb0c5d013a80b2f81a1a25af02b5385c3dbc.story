Survivor: Kevin McGrath, 70, was staying in a Sri Lankan guest house when the tsunami wave swept in. Above, he returns to the beach to remember

As Kevin McGrath walked along the baking sandy beach in the popular southern Sri Lankan resort of Unawatuna his thoughts focused on a decade earlier and the day he feared he would die, swept away near the same spot by the power of the tsunami wave. 

‘It was going to be the perfect day,’ the 70 year-old psycho therapist recalled, ‘ the weather had been unusually good and it was a holiday for local people so we were expecting it to be just perfect.’ 

Mr McGrath and his wife Diana were staying in a room on the first floor of a guest house, set among palm trees and protected by a small hotel 50-metres from the beach at Unawatuna, a resort popular with Western tourists close to the southern city of Galle. 

‘It was 9.20am and I was still in my room when I heard a noise just as I was getting up,’ he said, ‘I thought it was a bus but it was too loud...maybe a helicopter. 

‘I went out on to the balcony and my wife was there. We could see a dark line in the water and this loud, thunderous noise. It was extraordinary. We stood and watched as the water came in relentlessly, powerfully.’ 

People who were on the beach were screaming and running for their lives, others were desperately trying the cling on to palm trees or make it to the highest point in surrounding buildings. 

‘The water came over the sand, picking up fishing boats and sun loungers, washing them across the road and sending them crashing into buildings and cars. The power was so great that one of the boats side-swiped a bungalow demolishing it. 

‘I knew it was a tsunami and I thought “God, this must be a big one”. I was calculating mentally as the water was rising and we went to the back of the house to see if it was possible to go higher. 

‘I remember thinking it was ironic that I was going to die here on holiday…if the water kept rising, I would die. It was a seven or eight metre wall and it just swept on. 

‘We could hear buildings collapsing, objects crashing in to one another, the cries of desperate people and animals. 

‘Our building was made of reinforced concrete but walls around us were punched out by the water. 

‘I began to take photographs, I thought that if I died there I wanted people to know how and why I died. It had reached the first floor and our room but then suddenly stopped rising. 

‘The power of the water was just incredible. People were in quite a lot of distress – as the water was going down they were being towed out to sea together with all kind of debris. 

‘A British couple sleeping on the ground floor after partying the night before were blown out of bed by the water and ended up stark naked hanging on to palm trees.

‘People were being pulled screaming out of the water, they were clinging for dear life to anything they could lay their hands on that was fixed to the ground. 

‘We saw a young girl being swept away and shouted for her to hang on the gate post. She survived. 

‘We stayed on the balcony for another house. There was a German woman going in to deep shock. Her partner had gone for a walk and was missing. He turned up eventually covered in mud, cuts and debris.’ 

Mr McGrath, from Ironbridge, Shropshire, continued: ‘We went down stairs and it was almost unrecognisable. The road was full of water that was knee-height. 

‘We picked our way through glass, dead dogs, filth. It looked like Sarajevo after taking major mortar fire. There was so much devastation. The bay was full of rubbish, the coral had been trashed and was floating about, a fridge-freezer was floating by.’ 

They made their way to the Rock House, one of the buildings that had survived with little damage and joined 200 others. 

‘There was a lot of panic, a lot of anxiety,’ Mr McGrath said. ‘There was a bit of aftershock and one much smaller wave. 

‘On a beach nearby a French couple had lost their baby…almost everyone in the village had lost someone.’ 

Days later, the Britons were evacuated by the UK Embassy but within three months Mr McGrath had returned to help local schools and village vendors. 

Recovery: Along Unawatuna beach, pictured above, there are still some reminders of the day when the tsunami struck. Mr McGrath returned this year to take part in a memorial service held there on Boxing Day

He was back again for the first anniversary where tens of thousands of traditional clay oil lamps were lit on the beach in memory of those who died – a memorial repeated this Boxing Day. 

Along Unawatuna there are still some reminders of that dreadful day a decade ago from the waterlines marked on walls and three 25ft above sea level to the clock on a popular beachfront hotel and bar wall which stopped at 9.27am when it was washed from the wall. 

The clock has been hung again but the time remains untouched. 

In the room where Mr McGrath feared he would die as he watched the water rise and rise, there is a mark he made on the wall of his first floor room when it was at its highest. Each year he returns to the same room and remembers.
