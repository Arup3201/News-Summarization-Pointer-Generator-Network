Resigned: Richard Grenell resigned from his post weeks after he was hired

Mitt Romney’s openly gay national security spokesman has resigned from his post after being on the job less than a month.

Richard Grenell said in a statement that he resigned because of the ‘hyper-partisan discussion of personal issues that sometimes comes from a presidential campaign.’

His employment under the Romney campaign had been heavily questioned by Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association, who said Mr Grenell posed a national security risk.

In a statement issued exclusively to the Washington Post, Mr Grenell said: ‘I want to thank Governor Romney for his belief in me and my abilities and his clear message to me that being openly gay was a non-issue for him and his team.’

Matt Rhodes, Romney’s campaign manager, said in a statement that the likely GOP candidate and his team were ‘disappointed that Ric decided to resign from the campaign for his own personal reasons.

‘We wanted him to stay because he had superior qualifications for the position he was hired to fill.’

His highly active Twitter page has been silent - his last tweet was on April 27.

He got into hot water over his sexist and offensive tweets days after he was appointed Romney's spokesperson.

Grenell, who formerly worked as a spokesman for George W.Bush, has deleted more than 800 of his past tweets including scathing remarks which mocked Michelle Obama, Callista Gingrich, Hillary Clinton and female news reporters.

But reporters spotted Grenell’s sexist snipes and cutting comments, which largely targeted the media and high-profile female Democrats, before he had the chance to erase them.

In one tweet, which has been removed from the site, Grenell reflected on First Lady Michelle Obama ‘sweating on the East Room carpet' as she worked out in the White House.

In another tweet he took a swipe at her grammar posting: ‘First Lady slang? Michelle Obama tonight in North Carolina said: 'Because I got to get home after this.' is that transcript right?’

And Romney’s new national security and foreign policy spokesman repeatedly took to the social media site to slam Newt Gingrich's wife, Callista. 

Lookalikes: In one tweet Grenell wrote that Hillary Clinton is starting to look like her Secretary of State predecessor - Madeleine Albright 

Harsh: Grenell used Twitter to ask if Callista Gringrich's hair was clipped on

Grenell, who lives with his long-term partner Matthew Lashey, asked whether Callista Gingrich’s ‘hair snaps on’ and, in a separate tweet, commented that Gingrich’s third wife ‘stands there like she is wife #1’.

Hillary Clinton was another victim of Grenell’s acerbic tongue when he compared her to Madele  ine Albright, the first female Secretary of State, who served under Bill Clinton.

'Hillary is starting to look liek [sic] Madeline Albright,’ he wrote on his Twitter page.

He saved some of his most 
misogynistic remarks for MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who he patronizingly 
advised to ‘take a breath and wear a necklace’ and said she was a 'dead
ringer' for teenage pop sensation Justin Bieber.

The
Huffington Post were directed to Grenell’s original statement defending
his tweets, which can no longer be seen on his feed.

'My tweets were written to be tongue-in-cheek and humorous but I can now see how they can also be hurtful,' Grenell said.  

'I didn’t mean them that way and will remove them from twitter. I apologize for any hurt they caused.'

However,
Maddow didn’t accept the apology and, during a Friday night show, asked
if the Romney campaign sees ‘any sign that they understand that a long,
string of really nasty, sexist tweets about Callista Gingrich's 
appearance might be alienating to people who might otherwise consider 
voting for Mr. Romney,’ reported the Huffington Post.

Dead ringer: Rachel Maddow, an MSNBC host, was unamused by Grenell's tweet saying she was a dead ringer for pop sensation Justin Bieber

Grenell seems to have also taken down his personal website where he wrote about politics and the media.

Grenell
has previously said that what he 'love[s] about twitter and facebook is
that it has outed reporters from their phony facade of pretend 
non-partisan commentary.'

Another of his sexist tweets read: 'Note to children: when your mom is a grandmother DO NOT let her wear backless dresses.'
