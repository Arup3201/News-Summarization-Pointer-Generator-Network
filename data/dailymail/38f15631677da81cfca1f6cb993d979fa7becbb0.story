Ad was hot topic on Twitter and spurred reaction from many Golden Globe viewers

L'Oreal is a broadcast sponsor for the Golden Globe Awards

L’Oreal has been accused of aggressively airbrushing Diane Keaton after its ad aired immediately after she appeared on stage at the Golden Globes.

While Ms Keaton looked fantastic at last night’s event, her 68 years were clear to see on her un-Botoxed face. The L’Oreal ad, however, shows the star with rather smoother skin.

Viewers were quick to react to the unfortunate commercial placement, sharing their views on Twitter.

Snap back: Twitter users began accusing L'Oreal of retouching Diane Keaton after one of her ad campaigns for the beauty brand aired directly after an un-photoshopped appearance on the Golden Globes

The comparison: In a TV ad for L'Oreal Paris's Age Perfect Glow oil, Ms Keaton appears remarkably plump and wrinkle-free

Gregg Giannillo wrote: ‘Worst 
commercial placement ever. Diane Keaton wrinkled on #GoldenGlobes then 
ageless and wrinkle-free in L'Oreal wrinkle serum commercial.’

Fellow
 viewer Vicky King agreed, dispatching: ‘After seeing the Diane Keaton 
L'Oréal commercial, it's very apparent there's no filter on the 
#GoldenGlobes cameras.’

And Lauren Bolger tweeted: ‘Wow L'Oréal. Great timing. I guess Diane Keaton stopped using your product! #GoldenGlobes’

Some tweeters even preferred the ad to Ms Keaton’s appearance on the Golden Globes.

Expressions: While Ms Keaton looks remarkable for her age, its clear how her expression lines are more visible in the Golden Globes telecast (left) than in her L'Oreal ad (right)

Film critic Lou Lumenick wrote: ‘Diane Keaton's L'Oreal Commercial is much better than her Woody Allen tribute.’

The actress's campaign spot was to promote L’Oreal’s Age Perfect Glow Renewal oil.

Indeed
 in comparing the two videos, it is clear that Ms Keaton’s face boasts 
more wrinkles in the Golden Globes broadcast than in the L’Oreal ad.

Online reaction: Twitter users including @LogicalLibby accused L'Oreal of using Photoshop

Bad timing: Gregg Giannillo pointed out the commercial's unfortunate timing

The
 campaign video’s soft lighting helps abet the appearance of Ms Keaton’s
 wrinkles – which, considering her age, are still few and far between in
 real life.

L’Oreal first signed Ms Keaton as a face in 2006 as a way to appeal to the aging baby-boomer audience.

She has since fronted many of the brand’s anti-aging products.

Beauty veteran: Ms Keaton has been a face for L'Oreal since 2006 but has never experienced controversy as a result until now

Ms Keaton made her appearance on the Golden Globes to accept the Cecil B DeMille Award on Woody Allen's behalf.

L'Oreal was an official broadcast sponsor for this year's awards.

@LogicalLibby: ‘L'Oreal shouldn't
 run their Diane Keaton commercial right after she's been onstage 
WITHOUT Photoshop. #GoldenGIobes’

Sher McAllister: ‘Is anyone else disturbed by 
seeing Diane Keaton's real face on the Golden Globes vs. her L'oreal 
anti-aging ad face? #CameraTrickery.’

Gregg Giannillo : ‘Worst 
commercial placement ever. Diane Keaton wrinkled on #GoldenGlobes then 
ageless and wrinkle-free in L'Oreal wrinkle serum commercial.’

Vicky King: ‘After seeing the Diane Keaton 
L'Oréal commercial, it's very apparent there's no filter on the 
#GoldenGlobes cameras.’

Lauren Bolger: ‘Wow L'Oréal. Great timing. I guess Diane Keaton stopped using your product! #GoldenGlobes’

Lou Lumenick: ‘Diane Keaton's L'Oreal Commercial is much better than her Woody Allen tribute.’

Sallie Cunningham: 'Thinking how refreshing is Diane Keaton, no Botox lips or facelift. Then they cut to her L'Oreal commercial and she had 25 year old skin.'

Darek Tatum: 'Wait. So Diane Keaton got all those wrinkles between filming the L’Oreal commercial and the Golden Globes? That’s unfortunate.'
