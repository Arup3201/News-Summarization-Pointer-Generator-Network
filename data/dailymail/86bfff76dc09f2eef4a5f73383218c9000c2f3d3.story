China has collected at least £2billion in fines from parents who broke the country’s strict one child policy.

The full amount emerged only because the country’s National Health and Family Planning Commission has begun a probe into where the money has gone.

The government department said yesterday that 24 provincial governments had failed to account for ‘20 billion yuan’ (£1.97 billion) worth of penalties handed to families who flouted family planning laws last year.

A further ten provinces have yet to reveal how much they collected in fines during 2012, according to China’s state-run media, suggesting the total amount levied could run into millions more.

The fines are known as ‘social support fees’ and can cost families thousands of pounds per extra child.

The money is supposed to compensate local governments for the burden of additional children on social services.

But provincial chiefs have so far refused to reveal how the revenue collected during 2012 has been spent.

Wu Youshui, a lawyer campaigning on the issue in Zhejiang province, said: ‘The system has faced unquestioned abuse of power and corruption.’

Public anger has been growing about the one-child policy which was introduced in the late 1970s to prevent population growth spiralling in the country which now has 1.3 billion inhabitants.

Policy: The policy covers 63 per cent of China, though rules have been relaxed over the years to allow some couples to have a second child

The policy covers 63 per cent of China, though rules have been relaxed over the years to allow some couples to have a second child.

Officials in the country are known to carefully monitor women for signs of pregnancy.

Many women are escorted to clinics to undergo forced abortions if they get pregnant for a second time and the one-child policy has been attacked for encouraging infanticide of female babies because males are preferred.

Those couples who manage to give birth in secret are often later handed a financial penalty.

At a key Communist Party meeting last month top officials announced that any couple where one parent is a single child can now have two children. The move has thrown a spotlight on how money from fines is spent.

Famed Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou - who directed the 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony - owes thousands of pounds in fines for having three children.

And earlier this month a father of five from a poor rural community killed himself over fines he couldn’t afford.

The NHFPC has vowed to continue punishing any violation of the law.
