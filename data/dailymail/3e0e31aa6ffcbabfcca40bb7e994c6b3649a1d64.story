Sean Dyche has challenged Danny Ings to prove that his head has not been turned by speculation of a move to Liverpool by firing Burnley to Premier League survival.

The Burnley boss admitted after last weekend’s defeat at Sunderland that the England Under-21 striker looked as though he had been distracted by the transfer talk.

Liverpool failed to sign Ings before deadline day but are expected to try and agree a pre-contract that would guarantee the 22-year-old a £5million move to Anfield in the summer.

Dyche warned the player that he will have to get used to the speculation and expectation if he wants to make it to the top.

He said: ‘Danny’s a big player in Burnley but there’s a long way to go until you’re a really big player, and he has now gone onto a different level of learning.

‘If your journey is to play at the super top elite levels then you are going to have deal with a lot. If you’re Lionel Messi, you are scrutinised constantly every inch of your life.

‘The signs are that Danny is going to let his contract run down. He’s a young player who has a decision and it will naturally unfold.’

Asked about the prospect of Ings signing a pre-contract with Liverpool, Dyche added: ‘I leave that to the powers that be and any clubs that are interested.

‘It’s all a bit grey in this country. In Germany they’re very open about this sort of the thing. The player almost says farewell and the fans accept it, and he keeps playing. They know he’s going to give his lot.'
