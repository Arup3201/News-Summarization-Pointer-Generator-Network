Manchester United legends Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt surprised builders working at their new hotel by turning up during their lunch hour and challenging them to a game of football.

The Hotel Football project is the brainchild of new assistant manager Giggs and pundit Gary Neville but the Manchester Evening News today revealed Scholes, Butt and Phil Neville have also invested in the 133-bedroom scheme, due to open in Manchester in October.

Located across the road from Manchester United’s stadium, it will house the Old Trafford Supporters Club and will feature a five-a-side pitch on the roof.

And the Class of ’92 decided to give it a early run out during a visit on Wednesday afternoon.

High-vis yellow jackets were used as goalposts during the impromptu game.

After
 the kick-about, Gary Neville told the Manchester Evening News: 'Ryan 
and I are looking forward to another new challenge, working with our 
former teammates again to create something special near to the stadium 
we all love.'

Scholes added: 'When Gary and Ryan 
mentioned the idea of Hotel Football and Old Trafford Supporters Club I 
was really keen to get involved - the hotel is our chance to create 
something special for the fans.

Phil Neville said: 'We want The Old Trafford Supporters Club to become a place United fans can think of as their own.'

Giggs, 40, was appointed assistant to new Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal on Monday; the same day he called time on his glittering 23-year playing career in which he won 38 trophies.

The 40-year-old penned an emotional open letter to fans in which he thanked them for their continuous support.

Giggs and Neville’s first GG Hospitality project Café Football opened in London last December.
