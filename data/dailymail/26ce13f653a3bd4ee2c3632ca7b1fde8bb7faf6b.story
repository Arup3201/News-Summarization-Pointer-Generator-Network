Manchester United midfielder Anderson could become a Fiorentina player by the end of the day.

Talks are ongoing between the player, his representatives and Fiorentina sporting director Daniele Prade.

The finer details of the fee are also being discussed this afternoon but there has been a late bid from Napoli who are keen on the midfielder and Brazilian defender Fabio.

On the move: Anderson looks set to leave Manchester United for Fiorentina this month

Manager Vincenzo Montella has other problems which are also affecting British clubs.

Fiorentina have injuries to Giuseppe Rossi and Mario Gomez which means they are rivalling Premier League sides for the trio of strikers being offered around on loan from Italy; Roma's Marco Borriello and Juventus pair Mirko Vucinic and Fabio Quagliarella.

Fiorentina have also asked Chelsea about the availability of Demba Ba.

A few other players could leave Old Trafford this week with Cardiff City manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer having a choice to make between loan bids for either United defender Fabio or his team-mate Wilfried Zaha.

Sunderland may be willing to let hat-trick hero Adam Johnson leave the Stadium of Light.

Although his three goals were invaluable in Saturday's impressive win at Fulham, there has been interest from home and abroad in the Englandwinger, who has struggled for consistency since his much heralded move from Manchester City.

However, it is understood the asking price for the 26-year-old is around £14million and a if a team wanted to sign him on loan then the fee is £2m plus wages of around £60,000 per week.

Heading north? Gus Poyet is keen to sign Brighton's Liam Bridcutt

Sunderland are continuing to overhaul their squad as Gus Poyet begins to remould his team. Augsburg are reviving a move for striker Ji Dong-won after Borussia Dortmund switched their sights to other targets and there remains concern over Jack Colback's future with Everton weighing up an offer in this window.

Poyet remains keen on Brighton's Liam Bridcutt while they have enquired about Maxi Lopez at Catania and talks are ongoing for Argentinian trio Ignacio Scocco, Santiago Vergini and Mariano Andujar.

A loan deal for QPR's Julio Cesar looks too expensive at this stage, although they have also been offered Shaun Wright-Phillips and Andy Johnson.

Hull City manager Steve Bruce plans to step up his bid to sign Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic today.

A £5.25million fee has already been agreed with Everton for Jelavic but the player's preference has always been for West Ham. That has made Bruce wary of last minute hitches and he is keen to get agreements wrapped up as quickly as possible.

West Ham remain reluctant to match Hull's bid while Crystal Palace and Stoke have also shown an interest. Aston Villa, who had been mooted as a potential suitor, are not in the bidding.

Bruce is clearing the decks to make way for new blood. Misfit striker Nick Proschwitz has an offer from Ukraine while Aaron McLean is wanted by Peterborough and Bradford, who are also keen on Dagenham & Redbridge forward Rhys Murphy.

Target: Hull are also keen on signing Shane Long from West Brom

To cover all bases, Bruce sent scouts to watch Nantes striker Filip Djordjevic again yesterday. The 26-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, failed to add to his season's nine-goal tally against Lorient but set up team-mate Ismael Bangoura for a late winner.

West Ham may have to buy Joleon Lescott from Manchester City rather than pin their hopes on a loan. Manuel Pellegrini insists Lescott is staying but West Ham manager Sam Allardyce believes the defender will be available in the last week of the window.

However, City have more to lose with their player out of contract in the summer and, should he return to them at the end of a loan in May, they would still have to pay the remainder of his contract until July at around £90,000 a week.

West Ham may also look to take over the contract. Allardyce and his scouts are on the look out for midfielders as they prepare to lose Ravel Morrison to Fulham.

Mohamed Diame and Matt Jarvis also interest other clubs. They will hear later on Monday whether they have been successful in their bid for a work permit for Lacina Traore.

Carlton Cole is also free agent from today after his short-term deal expired.

A few Championship clubs are monitoring Scunthorpe United goalkeeper Sam Slocombe. The 25-year-old signed an extension to his contract last year Slocombe has been Scunthorpe's first-choice goalkeeper for the past two-and-half-seasons, but had to bide his time for first team football after joining the club from Bottesford Town five years ago.

Italian club Chievo have shown interest in Hull's captain, Robert Koren, on a pre-contract basis.

Koren is out of contract in the summer and is yet to be offered a new deal by the club. He has played 13 games and scored two goals in the Premier League so far this season.

Other clubs from England have shown an interest for the summer but aren't allowed to sign on pre-contract basis due to regulations.

Leeds United are willing to let Luke Varney, 31, Paul Green, 30, Adam Drury, 35, and El Hadji Diouf, 32, all leave Elland Road on free transfers.

Manager Brian McDermott had his first team players in for a dressing down on Sunday following their disastrous 6-0 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday and pulled no punches in terms of spelling out what had to change in the coming weeks.

Varney has had interest shown in him from Bristol City, Blackpool and Blackburn Rovers.

Manchester City could secure the third member of Nigeria's highly talented U17 World Cup squad by the end of this week.

City have already tied up Kelechi Iheanacho, who won the Golden Ball at the U17 World Cup after scoring six goals, on a pre-contract agreement ahead of his 18th birthday in October and held negotiations with midfielder Chidi Nwakali and his family.

Which four Premier League stars from two different clubs were spotted playing a knockabout game of football in London's Battersea Park among friends the day after a cup tie and just 24 hours before one was due to play again in the Premier League?

Now they are talking to a boy who has been dubbed the 'Nigerian Neymar' Musa Yahaya.

Yahaya scored four times in seven matches at the U17 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates and has been scouted by Tottenham, as well as teams in Portugal and Spain.

The 16-year-old's agent Babawo Mohammed has held talks with City and a deal is expected to be confirmed shortly.

Yahaya, who describes Barcelona's Andres Iniesta as his footballing hero and has admitted he dreams of playing for Real Madrid, was coy over his immediate future when asked at the end of last year. He told African website MTNFootball: 'I am not going to talk on that one [where he wants to move], I have a manager in Babawo Mohammed. I have left that for him to handle. He knows me and knows what is good for me.'

Former Reading and Portsmouth midfielder Brian Howard is in talks with Birmingham City. Howard linked up with Bulgarian giants CSKA Sofia last summer but is keen to return home.

Crystal Palace are giving trials to two young Swedes. Malmo striker 17-year-old striker Deniz Hümmet and Hammerby's 13-year-old striker Antwi Sinatra, always good for a comeback, will both be at Palace in the next fortnight.

Hummet has a new contract on offer from Malmo but his agent, Innocent Okeke says: 'We won't close any doors for an extension but we'll see after the tests with Crystal Palace.'

Hartlepool are signing Marlon Harewood who was released by Bristol City last month.

Liverpool may be limited in their transfer activity in January but Rubin Kazan midfielder Yann M'Vila is not on their wishlist.

The France anchorman is keen to return to Europe and is available but despite being good friends with Mamadou Sakho is not destined for Anfield. Mohamed Salah at Basle remains an ongoing project for Rodgers.
