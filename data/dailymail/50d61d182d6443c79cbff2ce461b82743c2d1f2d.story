A father has told how he watched his drag racer son flip his super-charged car at more than 300km/h only to race in his own high-speed run 30 minutes later.

Victor Bray witnessed Ben Bray's horrific accident in Queensland on Saturday but, as Ben was rescued by medics from his wrecked car at Willowbank Raceway, the 30-year-old told his dad to still compete.

Neither of them were aware that Ben had suffered potentially life-changing injuries - he was left with six fractured ribs and three fractured vertebrae.

'After watching the crash I had to race myself in 30 minutes. I didn't know how injured he was,' Victor told the Daily Mail Australia.

Flipped: Ben Bray's car crashed just 150 metres off the start line in Queensland on Saturday

It started off well: Ben was competing in the Winternationals at the Willowbank Raceway

'It wasn't easy... Ben told me to go. It was nerve wracking getting in the car. I kept thinking about what I had just seen.'

The crash can be seen in a dramatic video from the day, which shows how Ben's black Nissan Altima veered to the right about 150m off the start line.

It smashed into the wall roof-first before sliding meters down the track upside-down, crushing Ben.

The family drag racing team were competing in the Winternationals - the biggest drag racing event outside America - and it was a big date on the calender for Team Bray, who live in Queensland.

On its side: Ben's father Victor also witnessed the huge crash

Telling his dad to go and race wasn't the only unlikely thing Ben, 30, did when he escaped from the ravaged vehicle.

'He was out of the car and in a bit of pain but grabbed a selfie with the medics,' Victor laughed.

Unfortunately as the swelling set in on his injuries the pain also set in.

Victor explained his son is still undergoing tests but 'the main thing the doctor is worried about is a really bad vertebrae break'.

Ravaged: The car was destroyed by the time it came to a halt

The drag racing champion said that Ben has got full feeling in his legs and arms but they are not sure about the extent of damage yet.

'One of the operations we've been offered is very severe and it could limit his movement forever,' he said.

Ben is not talking properly but is conscious.

'He's still drugged up and in a lot of pain... today is the first day he can say 'yes' or 'no',' Victor revealed on Monday.

The father also described how awful it was to watch his son in the dramatic crash, doing the thing that they both love.

Record breaker: Ben had just set a world record before in the same car

'It was bad. You always wonder and know it's going to happen down the track.'

'The car got air under it and lifted off the ground... It all happened real quick, he lost control of the area package in the car once it lifted.'

The racing expert explained: '99 per cent of the time when you crash you are going to run straight into a wall but the aeordynamics in this car led it to lift.'

The proud father said: 'Ben just set a world record before that in the same car... now we know it obviously needs more downforce. Stepping into the world record zone you are taking risks'

'He's very lucky... he's got a lot to be thankful.'
