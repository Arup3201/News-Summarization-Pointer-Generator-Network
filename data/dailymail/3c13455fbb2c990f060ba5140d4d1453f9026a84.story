This attractive Somerset town hadn’t seen an occasion like this for a while.

Yeovil's reputation for giantkilling as a non-league outfit was well-established but it’s been a while now since they got one over on a big name. With the whole world watching on, was this going to be their day?

Enthusiasm in the town centre was much in evidence. Shop windows were bedecked in anything and everything green and white; paper pull-out pictures of the boys hoping to topple the mighty Manchester United adorned the window of the estate agent, the butcher, the baker.

Opportunistic merchants hawked jester hats and half-and-half scarves from supermarket shopping trollies. But with the shopping precinct freezing and deserted, it may have been a hard sell.

At Huish Park, those lucky enough to have secured tickets were giddy with excitement. Some darted straight for the turnstiles, seeking to secure the best vantage point on the terracing behind the goal. The home faithful were in fantastic voice 90 minutes before the start.

Others, in a scrum 20-deep, waited for the United team coach to arrive. Fans from eight to eighty stood around in anticipation, reminiscing and dreaming. Some might even have long enough in the tooth to recall the last time these two teams met, back in February 1949. United won 8-0 on that occasion.

When the gigantic vehicle rolled up, a hundred camera phones emerged from pockets and a hundred heads popped up, hoping to catch a fleeting glimpse of Wayne Rooney or Angel di Maria.

Led by Sir Bobby Charlton, the United players filed in. Saying nothing, heads down, minds focused. This was not a day for anything else. Sir Alex Ferguson chose a rather swifter mode of transport to get here, flying in by helicopter.

'I saw the back of Falcao's head,' said one wide-eyed young fan as the scrum dissipated. 'Well, I saw Rooney AND Di Maria,' countered his mate.

The club shop, a portakabin painted green, offered thousands of Yeovil programmes from yesteryear but few, if any, occasions were as prestigious as this.

The matchday programme, selling like hotcakes at £5 a pop outside, was a 96-page opus, really something special to keep. Four pages of which were devoted to autographs should any fan be lucky enough to get near the visiting superstars.

Gary Johnson, the Yeovil manager and as close as they get to a living legend around here, wanted his players to get close to United on the pitch - but not too close.

He ordered them not to ask Rooney, Di Maria, Falcao et al for ‘selfies’ afterwards or swap shirts, lest it distract from the task in hand.

There certainly wasn’t a welcoming committee once the match started - inside the first minute, Chris Smalling was hurried into a sliced clearance and Yeovil forward Kieffer Moore clattered into David De Gea.

The first chance fell to home captain Joseph Edwards, United’s £150m+ line-up taken aback.

Unlike those fabled Cup mudbaths of yore, the surface was immaculate and United soon settled into their familiar passing rhythm. Every time one of their moves broke down, a hearty cheer arose from the terrace. Danger averted for a few minutes more.

But Yeovil were dogged, putting United under pressure. Rooney and Falcao were pressed into defensive chores, while Paddy McNair and Moore were left dazed after a clash of heads. Both resumed wearing thick bandages.

You lost track of the number of hurried clearances Smalling and Tyler Blackett put straight out of play. Rafael’s pace was electric but always in the wrong direction. It took the 20-time champions of England over half-an-hour to register a shot, a James Wilson daisy-cutter that didn’t trouble Jed Steer in net.

United’s first-half funk seemed to be summed up when captain Rooney hit a basic 10-yard pass wide left to Luke Shaw with such force it went out into touch. They had been truly lacklustre.

Van Gaal threw on Juan Mata and Jonny Evans at half-time, searching desperately for impetus. Quite what Mata and United’s other overseas players made of it all, I don’t know.

Things could have been even worse for them. 10 minutes after the break, Samuel Foley’s cross fell invitingly for Moore to strike one. Dead centre, not too many yards out, he scuffed it and De Gea got down. A golden chance.

They were always likely to pay for it. Duly, on 63 minutes, Ander Herrera produced a superb volley on the turn to spark wild celebrations in the away end. It was a spectacular goal quite out of keeping with United’s performance.

The home crowd tried to urge a second wind from their now-flagging players. The shrill sound of a rattle could be heard above the din.

They nearly had an equaliser too, Edwards heading towards goal at the back post and denied by the unlikely figure of substitute Di Maria, whose introduction had sparked chants of ‘what a waste of money’ from the locals.

United were able to see out the closing stages in rarely-afforded comfort, especially after Di Maria surged 50 yards to dink the ball over Steer and make absolutely sure of their progress. ‘We’re going to Wembley,’ sang the United fans, finally able to relax.

For Yeovil, it wasn’t to be their day. But everyone present, from eight to eighty, will never forget the day Rooney, Falcao, Di Maria and co played in their backyard. And were not given one inch.
