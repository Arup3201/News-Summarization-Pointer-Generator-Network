Selfie sticks are like Marmite - you either love the idea or hate their very existence.

But a tiny new 'sticky' camera is set to replace the controversial gadget by letting you take high-resolution selfies from any angle and distance. 

Called Podo, the 2-inch (5cm) device has suction pads that can be attached to any surface and is remotely controlled by a smartphone using Bluetooth.

A tiny new camera is set to replace the controversial selfie stick. Called Podo, the device (pictured) has suction pads that mean it can be attached to any surface and is remotely controlled using a smartphone using Bluetooth. It is available to pre-order from Kickstarter

And because it weighs 51g and measures just 2-inches (5cm), these surfaces can be narrow poles, trees and even a person's skin.

Once the 8MP camera takes a photo, or records video footage, it automatically sends it back to an app, also over Bluetooth.

Size: 2 x 2 x 1 inches (5cm x 5cm x 2.5cm)

Weight: 51g (1.8 oz)

Camera: 8MP

Video: 720p 30fps

Flash: LED

Battery: 800mAH (two hours video)

Internal storage: 4GB

Sensor: Accelerometer

This sensor makes the Podo more advanced than many of the front-facing cameras found on Apple, Samsung and HTC phones.

The Podo app shows the battery level of the camera and lets people select the stream resolution, picture resolution and picture ratio. 

It additionally has a Mirror Preview feature that lets people see how the photo will look in real-time.  

The distance of the device depends on the phone it is paired with, but a  Bluetooth range can extend up to 300ft (100 metres). 

And a built-in 800mAH battery is said to last for two hours of continuous video recording. 

Podo launched on Kickstarter earlier this month and has already raised more than $330,000 (£221,000) of its $50,000 (£37,000) target.

Early Bird models of Podo have  sold out but people can pre-order the device for $89 (£60).

Devices are expected to ship in August, at which point they will retail for $99 (£66).

San Francisco entrepreneur Eddie Lee, co-founder of Podo, said: 'Podo is a fun-sized, Bluetooth-enabled camera that you control with your phone.

'You're no longer limited by the length of your arm or selfie stick.

'The coolest thing about Podo is that you can stick it anywhere - you don't need mounts or a selfie stick [and] your hands are free to do whatever.'  

'Our mission is to connect people through pictures.'
