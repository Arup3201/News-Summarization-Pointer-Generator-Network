Two of the biggest matches of the season will take place simultaneously next month when the Barclays Premier League clash between Manchester United and Chelsea kicks off 10 minutes after Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading.

The Football Association announced on Thursday that the first semi-final at Wembley between the Gunners and Steve Clarke's men will take place at 5.20pm on Saturday April 18 and be broadcast live on BBC One.

That sees it go head-to-head with Sky Sports' evening kick-off between Chelsea and United which is due to start at 5.30pm.
