Adoption chiefs have ended a ban on young children being placed with e-cigarette users after The Mail on Sunday highlighted the ‘misguided’ policy.

Last week, this newspaper told how a professional, middle-aged couple had been barred from adopting after a social worker spotted the would-be father ‘smoking’ an e-cigarette.

But last Monday, just 24 hours after we published our story, the British Association of Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) updated to its guidance, saying it had changed its e-cigarette policy.

At least a dozen councils in England had imposed a blanket-ban on placing children with parents who smoke, but new advice means some of these bans could be lifted

E-cigarettes do not produce smoke and the passive risk to others from the vapour they emit is‘extremely low’, according to a report last year by Public Health England. 

Neither is there any evidence to back up claims – widely held by e-cigarette critics – that they encourage children to try real cigarettes.

Nonetheless, we revealed that at least a dozen councils across England had imposed blanket-bans on placing under-fives with e-cigarette users.

The councils cited guidance from the BAAF, which had recommended ‘that users of e-cigarettes be considered as smokers’ until concerns about the devices were cleared up.

But now in the update to its guidance, the BAAF stated: ‘At the next meeting of our Health Group Advisory Committee (HGAC), we will be recommending that [fostering and adoption] agencies now consider e-cigarettes as different to tobacco cigarettes.

‘Agencies should therefore recognise the low risk to children and not see the use of e-cigarettes as a reason to preclude foster carers or adopters purely on this basis. Each circumstance should be risk assessed on an individual basis.’

It continued: ‘E-cigarettes appear to have positive benefits for smokers when providing them with a route to abstinence and the risk to children from passive smoke is lessened.

‘However, this needs to be balanced against the risk of providing a model for the child of smoking now, or in the future.

New guidelines say e-cigarettes should be considered as different from traditional tobacco cigarettes, as the danger of passive smoking is greatly reduced

‘We will continue to monitor research into e-cigarettes and will continue reviewing our recommendations.’

The BAAF said it had changed its guidance ‘in light of the latest Public Health England report’ – which The Mail on Sunday cited in last week’s article.

‘Abigail’ and ‘Brian’, who went through a year-long adoption selection process with Staffordshire County Council only to be turned down after Brian was spotted puffing on an e-cigarette, last night hailed the change as ‘really good news’.

Abigail said: ‘It’s a shame for us that it took such lengths for things to change, but at least other couples should be spared what we went through.’

Robert West, professor of health psychology at University College London, who last week described the e-cigarette banning policy as ‘misguided and unethical’, said: ‘This is very welcome news, and demonstrates the importance of ensuring that policy decisions are based on good information.’

Ann McNeil, professor of tobacco addiction at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, said: ‘I welcome the changed recommendation, in particular that e-cigarettes be considered different to tobacco cigarettes.

‘E-cigarettes and cigarettes are indeed very different products in how they work, what they contain, what they emit and their relative harmfulness.

‘By making this change, BAAF will help people to understand that e-cigarettes are a less harmful alternative to deadly tobacco cigarettes.’
