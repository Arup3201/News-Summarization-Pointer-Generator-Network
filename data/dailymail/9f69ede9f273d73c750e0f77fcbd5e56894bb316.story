The sobbing that cooks have endured while chopping onions in the kitchen could soon be a thing of the past.

Scientists say they have managed produce a tear-free version of the vegetable thanks to cutting-edge technology.

Japanese scientists disabled the production of the powerful substance that an onion releases as the knife slices into it, cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes.

In a press release, scientists said that the typical burning sensation of a raw onion was reduced too.

The enzyme responsible is known as lachrymatory factor (LF) synthase. 

When an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial S-oxide. This makes up the LF enzyme and is responsible for causing tears. 

This reaction also creates thiosulphinate, which creates the onion’s distinctive flavour.

The enzyme responsible is known as lachrymatory factor (LF) synthase.

When an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial S-oxide. 

This makes up the LF enzyme and is responsible for causing tears. 

This reaction also creates thiosulphinate, which determines the onion’s flavour.

During tests, scientists found that LF is formed in the presence of an enzyme called alliinase (AL), typically found in garlic, as well as Prencso.

If any one of these three components in the reaction was omitted,  levels of LF dropped.

House Foods Group, who developed the technology, bombarded a bulb with irradiating ions in a process that removed these components and drastically reduced the level of this LF enzyme.

The company's researchers led by Shinsuke Imai won the Ig Nobel Prize - an award handed out to honour achievements organisers consider unintentionally funny - in 2013 for their discovery of the biochemical process behind how onions make people cry.

Their research paper was published in the journal Nature in 2002.  

However, a spokesman said no decision had yet been made on whether they would commercialise their tear-free onions. 

Earlier this year, UK supermarket Asda began selling its Sweet Red onion which has 'lower pungency levels'. 

This results in a milder flavour and fewer tears. 

This particular onion was grown by farmer Alastair Findlay of Bedfordshire Growers and costs £1.
