Attack: Ed Miliband will accuse firms of targeting vulnerable families and causing misery for millions

David Cameron was under increasing pressure to  stop the spread of fixed-odds betting terminals last night.

Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans to give councils the power to ban the gambling machines, which have been dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of the high street’.

Mr Miliband admitted Labour, which allowed the creation of the machines in the 2005 Gambling Act, had ‘changed our mind’, following widespread concern that the machines are addictive for problem gamblers.

Bookmakers now rake in more than £1billion a year in profits from the machines, which allow punters to gamble up to £300 a minute, or £18,000 an hour, mostly on electronic roulette.

Mr Miliband said he would legislate to put betting shops in a separate planning class so that councils can control the number opening in their area.

That plan has already been backed by the Liberal Democrats at their party conference.

Currently betting shops are classified as ‘financial and professional services’, which means that one can open in any building that used to be a bank, building society, estate agent or employment agency without needing planning permission.

Labour would also legislate to give councils the power to revoke or reduce the number of FOBTs in betting shops, currently capped at four, potentially to zero.

Finally, the party says it would legislate to increase the time between plays, curtrently once every 20 seconds, requiring on screen warnings and breaks in play.

Industry: Fixed odds betting temrinals (FOBTs) make more than £1billion a year in Britain

Mr Miliband said: ‘There’s clearly a massive and growing epidemic in some parts of our country of people losing huge amounts of money on these fixed odds betting machines. Our high streets are turning into high stakes, high cost venues for gambling.

‘I’m not objecting to having a betting shop or two on my high street but I don’t think people want the high street to be full of betting shops.

‘It’s right that we stand up to a powerful and important industry, the gambling industry. The betting industry has its place in the country but we can’t let them dominate our decisions.’

David Cameron has expressed concern about the issue but the Department for Culture has delayed any action while a review of betting habits on gambling machines is conducted - due to report back in the autumn.

Mr Miliband accused the Government of failing to act.

‘They
 seem incredibly reluctant to act. I want to force them to act. I’d 
rather they acted now rather than wait 18 months. They’re too slow. They
 should stand up to the vested interests.

Mr Miliband conceded that Labour’s gambling policy from 2005 has proved problematic.

‘We’ve changed our approach on the basis of the evidence.

In
 2007/8 when the supercasinos were stopped people thought that was the 
big issue, actually this turned out to be as important an issue and it 
needs to be dealt with.

We’re responding to the evidence, which is concerning and worrying. Something needs to be done.’

Mr
 Miliband will stop short of agreeing with one key demand of campaigners
 against the proliferation of the machines, which is for the maximum 
stake to be slashed to £2 per spin.

But he told the Mail: ‘We don’t rule that out. We don’t rule out going further.’

The
 Tories accused Labour of hypocrisy for accepting hundreds of thousands 
of pounds in donations from top gambling figures, including Peter Coates
 of Bet365 and industry lobbyist Neil Goulden, the former boss of the 
Association of British Bookmakers.

In
 total, Labour have received £192,000 of cash from Goulden and Coates- 
with some of the donations being registered only months ago.

Two key members of his Shadow Cabinet, Tristram Hunt and Chuka Umunna, have also pocketed cash directly from gambling tycoons.

But
 Mr Miliband said his policy would not be affected by the donations. 
‘There are people who are Labour supporters in all walks of life, 
whether they’re Labour supporters or not we’ll do the right thing for 
the country.’

Derek Webb, 
Founder of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling and Stop the FOBTs Campaign,
 said: ‘We welcome this announcement and look forward to the national 
debate that now looks set to take place. The Coalition can’t continue to
 delay action on FOBTs any longer.’

The
 Association of British Bookmakers condemned the plans. A spokesman 
said: ‘This announcement has nothing to do with helping problem 
gamblers; it is simply about playing politics with the jobs of 40,000 
people, and the enjoyment of 8 million customers for no reason.’

David
 Cameron has expressed concern about the issue but the Department for 
Culture has delayed any action while a review of betting habits on 
gambling machines is conducted. It is due to report back in the autumn.
