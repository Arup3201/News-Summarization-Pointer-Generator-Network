Passengers traveling overnight from London to Scotland can expect to travel in style - whatever the outcome of September's referendum.

Caledonian Sleeper operator Serco - an English company -  has pledged to see out its 15-year contract for the service between London and Scotland regardless of the outcome of the election.

They have also promised to improve the service with brand new trains, spending up to £50million on refurbishment, and potentially providing more jobs.

Overnight service: Serco's pledge to see out its contract has caused controversy among rail unions

But rail unions have attacked the decision to take the sleeper out of Scottish hands and give it to an English company with Spanish trains and 'a truly shocking track record in the delivery of public services'.

Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said ministers 'had no choice', and insisted the appointment will herald 'a new beginning' for the service.

Jamie
 Ross, business development manager at Serco, said: 'We are fully 
committed to a 15-year contract. Our new chief executive joined a month 
ago and totally immersed himself in the sleeper bid.

'There
 are no plans for staff reductions. Because this is being split out from
 the main ScotRail franchise, if anything the total number of people 
employed will go up.

'There's
 a huge push to get local suppliers involved, most obviously in food and
 drink but also in getting things like Shetland blankets, so benefits 
flow out much wider than the network.'

Mr Brown said the current sleeper is 'less than ideal' and Serco offers 'a dramatically improved prospect at a reduced price.'

He said: '(Independence) wouldn't be a material consideration for them although we have seen in the past different franchise operators essentially ditching the contracts, in the East Coast Main Line for example, although we have no intention to see this change. It's a 15-year contract and that's what we intend to see through.

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'This decision flies in the face of everything (Scottish First Minister) Alex Salmond has been saying about an independent, financially strong Scotland.

'He has taken the contract away from an Aberdeen-based Scottish firm and handed it to an English-based firm which will be given a £60 million subsidy to build new trains in Spain. How does that create any new jobs in his dreamland of an independent Scotland?'

Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, said: 'No-one has taken on board the concerns of the staff who are currently involved, and their futures. We shall be contacting all parties on behalf of our members.'

But Mr Brown added: 'We have no choice in (the franchise), we have to go with who wins the bid and the best bid came from Serco.'

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, a Highland MP, said the sleeper is 'a vital service for many Highlanders and an important link to the UK capital'.

'That is why the UK Government has set aside £50 million, with an additional £50 million expected from the Scottish Government, to refurbish rolling stock and support the long-term future of the route.

'As someone who uses the route, I am looking forward to the excellent service provided by staff being matched by facilities which will make the Caledonian Sleeper an experience to savour.'
