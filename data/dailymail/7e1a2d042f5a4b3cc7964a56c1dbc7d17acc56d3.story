Mario Balotelli's continued slump is nothing a touch of tender loving care can't solve, says Andrea Pirlo.

The Liverpool striker has struggled severely in front of goal since joining for £16million in the summer.

His attitude has also come into question, with critics aiming pot-shots at the Italian's work ethic and general demeanour.

But Pirlo - who played alongside Balotelli at AC Milan and for Italy - believes the 24-year-old merely needs an arm around the shoulder from his manager Brendan Rodgers.  

‘The difference between other players and Mario is that every action he takes is going to be scrutinised,' Pirlo said. 

'The media is interested in him, and things he does are going to be highlighted - where perhaps with other players they would not get such a reaction - or maybe even no reaction at all.

‘There is no question over his talent - I have played with him and I know how good he is and how good he can be. It is the job of the Liverpool coach to manage him in the right way.'

Rodgers has so far persevered with Balotelli up front in the league but faces some difficult decisions 

Liverpool fans will be left wondering why Balotelli has still failed to score in the Premier League, but Pirlo is left in no doubt that his former team-mate will become a star on Merseyside.  

‘He needs to be loved, he needs direction, but most importantly he needs to know that the coach believes in him,' the midfielder added. 

'If he spends time with Mario - I know he can still go on and be a great player for Liverpool.'
