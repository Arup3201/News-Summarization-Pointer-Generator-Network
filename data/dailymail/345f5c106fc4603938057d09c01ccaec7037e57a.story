A spectacular animation compiled using images that are over 50-years-old is offering a glimpse into what Piccadilly Circus looked like decades ago.

Using images from archives combined with old weather reports and pioneering colouring and animation software, London agency FullScream recreated what the famous London landmark would have looked like on a Spring weekday evening in May 1961.

Panning across the Statue of Eros, users can see the neon Coca-Cola sign installed in 1954, and BP's billboard of 1961.

Using images from archives combined with old weather reports and pioneering colouring and animation software, London agency FullScream created what the famous London landmark would have looked and felt like on a Spring weekday evening in May 1961

Panning across the Statue of Eros, you can see the neon Coca-Cola sign installed in 1954, and BP's billboard of 1961

This is what the famous landmark looks like today - fewer billboards and more LED signs

Users can see how the billboards used to stretch further into Shaftsbury Avenue, and how there were many smaller advertisements, rather than the few bright LCD screens we're used to seeing today.

Martini, Dunlop and Scotch Ale are other brands who used to have billboards shown in the charming animation.

FullScream opened in London in February and Ced Pakusevskij director said: 'At the end of our first week in London, we walked to Piccadilly Circus and sat there, enjoying its marvel.

'We wondered what it might have looked and felt like before all the big screens; when the billboards were made of mechanisms and neons. After some research and finding incredible archive photographs, we decided to re-create it.'

Tom Church, Director of FullScream said: 'Imagine having gone to see such a film or play, and walking past the entrancing billboards of Piccadilly Circus. It must have been spectacular'

Mr Church added: 'Strangely for such a famous landmark, there are very few large, original coloured pictures from the 1940s - 1960s. FullScream had to find a number of photographs and layer them on top of each other'

The agency used other photographs to create movement, remastering many from black and white

The creative project has an air of West End romance and mystery.

Tom Church, Director of FullScream said: '1961 was the year of West Side Story, La Dolce Vita and Breakfast at Tiffany's.

'The Palace Theatre on Shaftsbury Avenue had just started The Sound of Music. Imagine having gone to see such a film or play, and walking past the entrancing billboards of Piccadilly Circus. It must have been spectacular.'

Mr Church added: 'Strangely for such a famous landmark, there are very few large, original coloured pictures from the 1940s - 1960s. FullScream had to find a number of photographs and layer them on top of each other. However, as each photograph was from a different year, the Piccadilly Circus billboards changed between the photos.'

He explained to keep it consistent, the agency had to remove people, advertisements and some structures.

Once FullScream had the photos they created styleboards imagining how the billboards would look and feel when lit up.

Using professional creative design software including Adobe After Effects and 3D camera mapping programs, they were able to create camera movement through Piccadilly Circus and past the Statue of Eros.

Their process of turning historical photographs into animated backdrops is the same as that used by Hollywood filmographers, such as in Moulin Rouge - it is more cost effective than creating computer generated imagery (CGI) from scratch or designing cityscapes.
