I know it makes a lot of you see Red. The idea that so many of our football shows’ pundit chairs are seemingly warmed frequently by the backsides of so many ex-Liverpool players. And if that is you, then Saturday evening’s coverage of the jewel in club football’s crown may have just been too much to bear.

No sooner had Harry Redknapp got his second soaking of the afternoon - the first, from a hailstorm. the second, victory champagne following QPR’s play-off final victory at Wembley - than Sky Sports were off to The Champions League Final.  And there, his boy Jamie was waiting for us in Lisbon. While alongside him, two more ex-Liverpool men, Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness.

But just in case that wasn’t enough Anfield for you, over on ITV, they were preparing to unveil none other than Steven Gerrard as their guest pundit for the evening. Like the song says, they never do walk alone, do they?

Having said all that, the real point is that each man is there in his own right. And certainly for those men on Sky, that worked well during their extensive build up.

Graeme Souness was his chippy self from the get go. Modric, he told us ‘borders on being a 5-a-side player’.

While Ramos is ‘an accident waiting to happen’. Jamie Redknapp delivered the one liner of the night when discussing the virtues of Diego Simeone as a leader. ‘Some managers do their preparations in the mirror’, he said. But alas, he couldn’t be convinced to then go on and name names.

Jamie Carragher was then in his pomp, breaking down and analysing tactics and formations at the big screen. Although I have to be honest, it did seem to go on for absolutely ages without anyone else chipping in. Perhaps they’d all taken the chance to sneak a cheeky latte?

This was their first hour of coverage, and lead just about perfectly to when ITV came on air. Which they did, by the way, with an absolutely dynamite flamenco opening sequence.

Adrian Chiles picked up where the guitarists left off, nearly bursting with the joy of not only introducing the Liverpool captain to the game, but also the fact that he was about to ‘get to work with Roy Keane’.

To which Stevie G responded that is it was ‘very exciting’. Only he said it with the tone of voice and body language of a man who had just been delivered blindfolded in the back of a transit van.

However, he did quickly warm to the occasion. Unfortunately, just at the moment when all the Lads In Red were suddenly upstaged by a surprise package - and yet another former member of the fold.

This particular one, making his entrance for the evening down on the pitch, in a slick three piece suit, sunglasses and sipping on a Cappuccino.

No doubt about it, the star of both channels was the suspended Galactico Xabi Alonso. Real Madrid’s loss was telly’s gain. First, he was great in the studio with the Sky boys. He talked about how well Gareth Bale had ‘integrated into the club, into the city’.

He took Souness to task about Modric’s contribution this season, explaining he had been ‘outstanding’. And then went on to illustrate how the Madrid personnel would deal tactically with Atletico. It had Souness purring like a kitten and telling Xabi how much he would be missed out there.

Well, luckily, there didn’t seem to be a camera inside the Estadio da Luz that missed him from then on in.

ITV quickly got themselves in on the Alonso lovefest - showing us the impromptu moment when he nipped in to say hello to his old team mate Gerrard. Then it was all down to the match director to use him as punctuation throughout the game.

ITV were first out of the blocks in taking advantage of these candid shots. At half time, they stealthily attached his reaction to the replays of Gareth Bale’s chance. And it seemed that whatever Xabi was kicking, he was doing it much more effectively than Gareth had just done.

Into the second half, and we got even more Xabi for our money. First, there he was hugging a team mate within an inch of his life as another chance went begging. Then when Ramos equalised  - something happened, Graeme, but it wasn’t an accident! - we saw a face filled with relief as it puffed out, puckered it’s lips and kissed the top of a team mate’s head.

Finally, he was back on the pitch trying to rally his pals for one last surge. And while he was there, Xabi took time to also turn to the Real fans and urge them to do the same. The glasses and coffee were gone by now. It was nitty-gritty time.

So Sky Sports saw their season off with a bang. While ITV neatly dovetailed their switch to Rio in a couple of weeks time by bringing the England captain on board. But at the end of the evening, in telly terms, it was the X Man who was first class.
