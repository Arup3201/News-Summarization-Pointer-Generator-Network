 A pair of New York cops might lose their badges after being accused of attempting to have sex with an alleged rape victim.

Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, have each been hit with departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media.

Skorzewski is married and Lamboy works in the Manhattan Special Victims Division. 

Skorzewski has also been removed from the special victims unit and busted to beat cop duty at the 114th Precinct in Astoria, Queens. 

Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, have each been hit with departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media

The Daily News reports that Deputy Chief Kim Royster confirmed the charges. 

The duo can plead guilty and accept a penalty or go to trial. 

Of Skorzewski the alleged victim said: 'I am surprised that he is still working. I never really blamed the lieutenant, but he’s partially responsible because he took us out drinking. They paid for everything.'

The accuser claimed he had been so drunk that servers at an Irish bar in downtown Seattle refused to give him any more alcohol.

'We actually got kicked out of that one,' she said. 'Luke’s wife also called him around that time. She was really upset that they were out drinking.'

She claims he later called her 'my favorite victim.'

Neither of the officers has commented.

The woman reportedly met them in 2013 when she, a college student, reported a rape to Skorzewski after allegedly being attacked at a Union Square apartment. 

She had named a former 'Law & Order: SVU' writer.

The officers traveled to Seattle to interview her about the case that July.

She admitted to thinking Skorzewski was attractive and was suprised at the then officer's youthfulness.

During the trip, they insisted she drink with them, and after a day of boozing invited her to stay at their hotel.

Upon going to the room, Skorzewski told her she was 'really cool' and 'awesome.'

He offered her the bed while he crashed on the couch but when the morning came he asked to get in bed and put his arm around her, then requested a kiss. 

She told the married cop with two kids no, and he became aggressive. 

'He really felt me up, tried to get his hands down my pants,' she told The Daily News. 'He was trying to put his hands down my pants or work them up my shorts.'

She went along for a time before breaking away and showering alone.

'I was afraid to tell anyone about what happened with Luke,' she said, as her rape investigation continued. 'At the end of the weekend, Lt. Lamboy was like, ‘You can’t tell anybody about this weekend. Your credibility will be shot.'

The cops never talked to her alleged rapist.

In April 2014, she finally wrote to the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau detailing her claims, which she says have been 'substantiated.'

'I was surprised that it took so long for anything to happen,' she said.
