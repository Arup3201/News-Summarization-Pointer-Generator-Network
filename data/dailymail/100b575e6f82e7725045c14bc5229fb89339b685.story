Novelist Adele Parks - whose latest project is from the perspective of a dementia sufferer

Her best-selling novels are normally filled with dilemmas involving love and romance.

But a dinner party with friends prompted Adele Parks to deviate from the ‘chick lit’ genre she is known for and become the first author to write from the point of view of a dementia sufferer.

Miss Parks found herself moved by the difficulties faced by several aquaintances struggling to help loved ones with the illness but afraid to speak about their battles openly.

The 45-year-old has written 13 novels in 13 years, all of which have topped the Times Bestseller List, but it is Whatever It Takes which was released last year, that she regards as one of her ‘most rewarding projects’.

The novel tells the tale of a young mother who moves to the countryside to be near her husband’s family and discovers that her mother-in-law has dementia.

The narrative switches between telling the story from the perspective of Margaret who has Alzheimer’s and her daughter-in-law.

Speakinmg about the novel for the first time and explaining the inspiration behind Whatever It Takes, Miss Parks said she was moved by the heartbreak of a friend who had had to have her father tagged and placed in a care home as he battled the late stages of dementia.

She said:  ‘The very first nugget of an idea came when I was at a dinner party. Towards the end of the evening one of the guests kept getting phone calls about her father.  We asked if she was alright then she started talking about him and how he was in the late stages of dementia.

'She told us a horror story about how he had gone missing from his care home. He’d left then forgotten where he lived.

'Then she said we’ve actually got him tagged now and I feel terrible. People say it’s taken away his liberty but she said, I just want him to be safe. My heart was breaking for her.

'Soon after that a close friend of mine told me his mother wasn’t well but no one knew what it was. Then after dozens of tests it turned she had Alzheimer’s.

'So it was these two incidents that started the idea for the book.’

Around 800,000 people in the UK have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.

Miss Parks, a married mother of one, spent months meticulously researching and spending lots of time with dementia sufferers and their families before publishing her book for public consumption last year.

Miss Parks, whose other bestselling titles include Husbands and Playing Away,  said: ‘I’m the first author to do this I believe, write from the point of view of a dementia sufferer in mainstream fiction.

‘I absolutely wanted to write from the Alzheimer sufferer’s perspective. It was essential to me – I didn’t want to write in a way that was just what everyone else thinks it must be like.

‘And as far as I’m aware and as far as people who have written to me, lots of people – either those suffering from Alzheimer’s or families and friends – all have said we hadn’t come across a book written like this before.’

And her depiction was ‘exactly right’, she said.

‘I described dementia as a ‘black smudge’ on your memory… absolutely horrifying.

‘And the sufferers I spoke to said that’s exactly what it’s like, a bit of your memory that’s just been rubbed out but  you know used to be there’, Miss Parks explained.

She said: ‘What was interesting, and very important to me, is that without exception everyone wanted to open up [about ementia] because it’s almost a secret they feel they have to keep.

‘There was a definite sense of relief just being able to talk about it.’

According to a poll carried out by the Alzheimer’s Society, to mark Dementia Awareness Week which runs until May 24, 41 per cent of those affected by the disease said they were keeping their concerns about it bottled up.

A further 64 per cent of the 1,043 people polled admitted to waiting six months or more after noticing symptoms before seeking professional help.

Miss Parks was speaking to raise awareness about Dementia Awareness Week which is organised annually by the Alzheimer’s Society.
