Rush Limbaugh’s parent company lost millions of dollars in revenue after the controversy following the right wing radio host’s referral to a college student as a ‘slut,’ Cumulus Media CEO Lew Dickey said.

Mr Dickey noted in a quarterly call with financial advisers that the snafu ‘hit us pretty hard.

He added that the loss was around ‘a couple of million bucks in the first quarter and a couple of million bucks in quarter two.’

Spoof: Saturday Night Live poked fun at advertiser's scrambling to pull out, and their 'replacement' with not-so-desirable sponsors

Limbaugh brought about a storm of backlash after he referred to Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke as a ‘slut’ and a ‘prostitute’ after she testified in Washington that birth control should be covered by health insurance companies.

Following the incident, dozens of advertisers pulled their content. In the end, nearly 100 sponsors withdrew their support, according to liberal watchdog group Media Matters.

Limbaugh insisted during the controversy that more advertisers were filling the gaps, the New York Daily News reported.

The incident was famously lampooned by Saturday Night Live’s Taran Killam, who played Limbaugh as he announced some of his new advertisers, including the Syria Tourism Board and Sherman’s Imitation Mayonnaise.’

Only 38 stations that air Limbaugh’s program are owned by Cumulus – the rest of the more than 600 stations are owned by Clear Channel Media.

According to Media Matters, the latter media group saw their first quarter revenues increase by six per cent to $571.5million.

Conservative website The Right Sphere waved off possible implications of Mr Dickey’s announcement, calling the loss in revenue the equivalence of a ‘rounding error.’

Limbaugh was also in the news today for launching a site in rebuttal to the progressive women’s group, the National Organisation for Women.

Bodacious: Limbaugh announced Tuesday the launch of 'Rush Babes for America'

The new association, dubbed the National Organisation for Rush Babes, is ‘dedicated to the millions of conservative women who know what they believe in: family, American Values, and not being told by Faux Feminist Groups how to think.’

Limbaugh said on his program Tuesday that NOW has one main problem: ‘The flaw…is thinking that they speak for women.

'If there was ever a group that speaks for an almost infinitesimal minority of women, it’s them,' he said, according to Politico.

Media Matters’ creator Angelo Carusone fired back, saying that it’s a ‘telling coincidence that Limbaugh launched “Rush Babes for America” on the same day that one of his affiliate providers reported millions in losses direction attributable to Limbaugh’s show.’
