David Ferrer secured his 22nd ATP Tour triumph with a straight-sets success over Tomas Berdych in the final of the Qatar ExxonMobil Open.

Berdych had cruised through the first four rounds, failing to drop a set and giving up a meagre 16 games en route to the final in Doha.

But the world No 7 and third seed found Ferrer an altogether different proposition as he lost 6-4 7-5.

Ferrer raced into a 4-1 lead in the opening set, and although Berdych managed to secure a break back in game six, he was unable to push the Spaniard any further.

In the 14th meeting between the two, with Berdych having won four of the last six, the Czech should have at least pushed the match to a decisive third set.

However, leading 5-4 in the second the 29-year-old squandered three set points on Ferrer's serve, which proved costly as the world number 10 then powered home to victory.

The Spaniard was handed the trophy by football icon David Beckham.
