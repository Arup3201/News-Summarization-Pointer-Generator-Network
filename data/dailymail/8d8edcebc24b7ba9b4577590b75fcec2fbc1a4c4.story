The girlfriend of Miami cannibal Rudy Eugene revealed her name and her face for the first time on Wednesday afternoon. She continued to claim her boyfriend of four months was a harmless man and a devout Christian.

Yovanka Bryant, 27, went so far as to say that Eugene, who was gunned down by police after he ate 75 percent of a homeless man's face, would have been a 'good father for her children.'

Standing alongside celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, Miss Bryant said Eugene was carrying a Bible before he stripped naked and went on a brutal, unprovoked rampage along the MacArthur Causeway outside Miami Beach during Memorial Day Weekend.

Speaking her mind: Miss Bryant, 27, appeared along side celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, who said she was representing Miss Bryant 'to help her have a voice'

She says the only explanation of Eugene's behavior is that he must have been drugged without his knowledge.

'I thought he would be a good father for my children. I wish the public knew Rudy the way I did, she said, according to CBS Miami.

She said they never talked about voodoo or cannibalism when they were together.

Miss Bryant released a photograph of her and Eugene kissing during a choreographed media appearance led by the famous attorney.

Allred represented Nicole Brown Simpson's family during the OJ Simpson murder trial. More recently, she stood with one of the women who accused former presidential candidate Herman Cain of sexual harassment.

Miss Bryant says her relationship with Eugene was marked by religious devotion. She says the couple had Bible studies together and watched religious TV programs.

She claimed Eugene was carrying a Bible with him before he stripped off all his clothes while walking three miles from Miami Beach to downtown Miami, Florida, in the scorching heat.

He also studied the Koran, she added.

However, she harmed her own credibility when she said Eugene lived a clean life.

'Rudy never drank alcohol or used drugs around me,' Miss Bryant said.

Moments later, she revised her claim: 'I only saw him smoke marijuana once,' she admitted.

A preliminary toxicology report shows Eugene had marijuana in his system when he was killed.

Authorities have said he snorted bath salts, which caused him to attack Ronald Poppo, the homeless man who is now recovering from the horrific injuries he sustained.

Medical examiners must wait at least two months before more in-depth blood tests can determine if Eugene had any other substances in his system. 

Miss Bryant acknowledged that her picture of Eugene is dramatically different than the public image of her boyfriend.

'This is a high-profile case,' Allred said.

'(Miss Bryant) wanted to have the truth come out about Rudy Eugene to have people understand him from her point of view. That is why I am here, to help her have a voice.'
