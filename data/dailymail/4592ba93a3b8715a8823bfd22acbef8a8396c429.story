They are a spooky mistake, revealing how Google is capturing the world's museums for its Street View project.

A Spanish artist has tracked down pictures of the bizarre blanket clad camera Google is using to capture special high resolution 360 degree images - and itself.

Mario Santamaría tracked down selfies of the robocam captured in the many mirrors of the museums it was photographing.

Google's camera is often shrouded in a silver sheet to minimise reflactions - making it appear ghostlike.

A specially designed Street View ‘trolley’ took 360 degree images of the interior of selected galleries which were then stitched together, enabling smooth navigation of over 385 rooms within the museums.

'Trolley is outfitted with a few components that are key to collecting indoor imagery: a panoramic camera to collect 360-degree views, lasers to capture distances to walls, motion sensors to track Trolley’s position, a hard drive to store data, and a laptop to operate the system,' Google said.

The results are a bizarre 'behind the curtain' looks at Google's project, Santamaría  said.

Google’s Art Project was launched three years ago as a sort of Street View for museums and art galleries.

Using panoramic cameras mounted on trolleys, Google captures the artwork and rooms of museums around the world, from the Louvre to the British Museum.

Santamaría hasn't reveled where his pictures are taken.

The images form part of Google's cultural institute, which has been putting galleries and museums online.

The Art Project is a unique collaboration with some of the world’s most acclaimed art institutions to enable people to discover and view artworks online in extraordinary detail.

Working with over 250 institutions, Google has put tens of thousands of works of art from more than 6,000 artists online.

'This involved taking a selection of super high resolution images of famous artworks, as well as collating more than thirty thousand other images into one plac,' Google said.

The gallery interiors can also be explored directly from within Street View in Google Maps.

'It also included building 360 degree tours of individual galleries using Street View ‘indoor’ technology.

Street View images now cover over 60 museums, with more on the way.
