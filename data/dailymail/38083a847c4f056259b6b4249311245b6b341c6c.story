This is definitely a case of workmanship falling short of the mark required - about 12 inches short to be precise.

Road workers have baffled residents after only repainting half a cycle lane marking - leaving it looking like 'someone has painted two Polo mints on the road'.

Instead of neatly repainting the whole sign after a section of a busy Hull road was dug up for a cable to be replaced, workers messily painted just a set of wheels to denote a cycle lane.

Woeful: Road workers have been ridiculed for this shoddy attempt to repaint a cycle lane in Hull

It has left Balfour Beatty and Northern 
Powergrid, who asked the contractor to carry out the work, red-faced 
after passers-by ridiculed the woeful work which even the artist 
admitted was shoddy.

Celia Hitchman, who lives opposite 
the cycle lane, said: 'It looks like someone has just come along and 
painted two Polo mints onto the road.'

Neighbour
 Ken Baldwin who is the former manager of Hull Business Improvement 
District (Bid), said: 'I would have thought someone would have been 
along to inspect it.

'I smiled when I saw it. I just thought, "typical".'

Pet
 shop owner Rob Nicklas said: 'I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. 
I’m really surprised they only painted half the cycle sign.

'I know paint is expensive these days, but it doesn’t make any sense to paint half a sign.

'I was cycling to work in Hull when I spotted it. I couldn’t believe it.'

Dog walker Sue Wilkinson also saw the funny side, but thought it did not portray Cottingham in the best light.

Sue said: 'If you’re going to do a job, you should do it properly. It looked pretty amateurish.'

A little further down the same road, more example of dubious paintwork was spotted.

This
 time, only the letters ‘O’ and ‘W’ - to make the word ‘SLOW’ - had been
 painted on a patch of road that had recently been resurfaced.

Ridiculous: One passerby said it looked as if 'someone has just come along and painted two Polo mints onto the road'

James Merrylees, external communications manager at Sheffield firm Balfour Beatty, said: 'Unfortunately, our artistic skills do not seem to have met our usual high standards in this instance.

'These markings were put down as a temporary measure by our reinstatement team and have now been rectified. We are sorry for any confusion caused.'

Balfour Beatty is working in the area, on behalf of Northern Powergrid, to replace and upgrade a major electricity cable.

A spokesman for East Riding Council said: 'Following the completion of these major works by contractors working on behalf of Northern Powergrid, the council has become aware of a number of shortcomings in the quality of the work done, including the road markings in several locations.

'The council will be meeting with the contractors on site next week to discuss its concerns, and will be seeking a satisfactory solution to the problems, to be funded by Northern Powergrid.'

This appears to be just the latest case of blundering workmanship becoming the butt of jokes and ridicule.

Last month, council workers painted two sets of double yellow lines down a cycle path which is too narrow for a car to squeeze down.

Tight squeeze: The cycle lane with double yellow lines in Nottingham is just 136cm wide and is too narrow for cars to get down

Cycle lane: The path cannot fit a car down it - but the council insist the lines are needed to protect cyclists in Nottingham

Motorists in Nottingham were baffled 
when the lines appeared down both sides of the 136cm wide lane which 
motorists couldn't park in even if they wanted to.

The average width of a five-door hatchback such as a Vauxhall Corsa is 174cm, so would be unable to get down the path.

However the council insist the lines are necessary to protect cyclists.

Workmen in Bedforshire were also subject to ridicule after painting a cycle lane down the centre of a busy road - because cars were parked down the edge.

Dopey workmen painted the large white bicycle symbols next to the central reservation line in Stotfold Road in Arlesey, Bedfordshire

The large white bicycle symbols are next to the central reservation line in Stotfold Road in Arlesey, Bedfordshire.

And instead of keeping to the side where they would be much safer, the new cycle path now encourages cyclists to dangerously go down the middle of the road.

Cyclist Pete Holland, 46, who lives on the street, said he can't understand why Central Bedfordshire Council would want cyclists to be in the middle of the road.
