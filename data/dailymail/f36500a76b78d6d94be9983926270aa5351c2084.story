Fears that use of Facebook and Twitter is making people ruder is a myth and Britain is still a nation of polite people, according to university researchers.

For centuries Britons have been famed for their reserve, indirect way of saying things and, of course, a love of queuing.

And although many of us might believe that modern life, texting and tweeting is making us as a nation ruder, the study from Lancaster University's Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences has found that the British are just as polite as ever.

Myth: Despite fears to the contrary, a new academic study has shown that using Twitter and Facebook is not making us ruder, and that Britain is still a nation of polite people

However, the research has revealed 
that what we find polite, and what we find rude, is unique to British 
culture, and can be very different to notions of rudeness in other 
countries.

As part of his research Professor Jonathan Culpeper, an expert in linguistic politeness, studied 500 diary reports of incidents of impoliteness experienced by those living in Britain, Germany, Finland, Turkey and China.

He found that whilst personal image and appearance was most important for Brits, social rights and fairness, and how they were perceived within a group, 
was most important for the Chinese.

'This fits the idea that British culture is more individualistic, 
whereas Chinese culture emphasizes one's position in the group and 
social reciprocity, for example reciprocal gift giving and returning 
favours,' said Professor Culpeper.

The
study also dispels the popular belief that we're getting ruder, with 
the perceived rise in impoliteness merely down to a clash of values 
between different generations.

Professor
Culpeper said that if anything, we are more polite than our ancestors, 
and that 400 years ago everyday language was far more plain and 
direct than it is today.

Professor Culpeper said: 'A thousand or so years ago in Old English, it was fine to use 
brusqueness which is jaw-dropping from our modern perspective.

National sport: The British are famed for their love of queuing, as these polite sports fans hoping to watch Andy Murray play at Wimbledon demonstrate

'Our 
impression of a massive explosion in the use of impolite language is 
partly the panic reaction of those with more traditional values meeting 
new values - values which encourage more direct ways of expressing 
emotions and doing business.'

He added: 'The new 'let it all hang out' culture is clashing 
with the "beat about the bush" culture. A result of this clash is a 
sense amongst traditionalists that their values are under attack.'

Professor Culpeper's research will be presented on November 4 as part of next week's Economic and Social Research Councilâ€™s annual Festival of Social Science, which encompasses a series of events across the UK.

As part of the study he also found that when people talk about things they consider impolite, they actually refer to a very limited number of things in specific contexts.

Professor Culpeper used the two-billion word Oxford English Corpus, an electronic collection of various writings including newspapers and online blogs, and found that actions likely to be described as rude or impolite included: 'evesdropping', interrupting', 'pointing', 'ignoring', 'smoking' and 'laughing'.

Among the people most likely to be described as rude or impolite included: 'doorman', 'bouncer', 'bartender', 'waitress', 'waiter', 'staff', 'guest' and 'customer'.

Many of these relate to those in public service, where people have expectations of entitlements, which are not always met.

Professor Culpeper said: 'Impoliteness often gets a bad press. It is assumed to be a poor, debased kind of language used for dysfunctional social purposes. But impoliteness can also be sophisticated, creative, and can entertain.'

The word most commonly used by people when describing events in which they had been offended was 'patronising', which Professor Culpeper said was because the British are particularly sensitive to power hierarchies and can take offence when a speaker adopts a position of superiority.

'What British people tend to react to and label as impoliteness are abuses of power, that is, cases where a person or group exerts power over another person or group beyond what is considered legitimate,' he said.

'This means that while asking someone to do something in a normal way is not considered impolite when the speaker is in a position of power, for example a boss asking an employee to do something, even politely worded requests could be deemed to be rude, if the speaker were in a position of very low power.'
