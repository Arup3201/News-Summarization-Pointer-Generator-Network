Two senior police officers have been suspended after they were allegedly found having sex in a police station while on duty.

Detective Inspector Diane Davies and PC Tommy Swales, who is married, were apparently discovered by colleagues from Dyfed-Powys Police.

At the time of the incident, DI Davies was the most senior officer on duty in the whole police force, which covers much of central and western Wales.

The pair were both suspended from duty while bosses investigate the allegations.

DI Davies and PC Swales were found having sex in the station in Brecon when other officers heard noises and worried that there might have been a break-in, according to The Sun.

Colleagues reported the pair to their superiors amidst concerns that their behaviour amounted to a dereliction of duty.

'Incidents like this are treated very seriously,' a source told The Sun. 'It's a question of integrity.'

DI Davies, a 44-year-old mother of one, 
was apparently set to be promoted before the allegations about her and 
PC Swales, a former professional footballer for Darlington FC who is 
married to fellow officer Michelle and has two children.

Investigation: Dyfed-Powys Police, whose headquarters in Carmarthen are pictured, has launched an inquiry into DI Diane Davies and PC Tommy Swales

A police insider said: 'It's been the talk of the force ever since it happened. It's not every day two police officers get caught in the act - they must have been making quite a racket.

'DI Davies is a career officer - she is very highly thought of and good at her job.'

Dyfed-Powys Police refused to confirm or deny the claims.

A spokesman said: 'Dyfed-Powys Police can confirm that two officers from Powys have been suspended from duty as part of an internal investigation.

'However, in light of the on-going inquiry it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.'

PC Swales and DI Davies have refused to comment on the allegations.
