Disciplined: Magistrate Yvonne Davies has been reprimanded after telling Christopher Duncan who she was sentencing for growing cannabis that addiction to the drug had led to the death of her  brother

A magistrate has been forced to resign after she told how cannabis led to her  brother’s untimely death when she sentenced a drug dealer.

Great-grandmother Yvonne  Davies issued a heartfelt plea to the cannabis grower to mend his ways as she described the devastating impact of her brother’s drugs addiction on her family.

Even though Mrs Davies says she had spoken about her family’s experience ‘hundreds of times’ during her 14 years on the bench, she was told that her actions fell ‘well below’ the standards expected.

Following four complaints – including one from a pro-cannabis campaigner – Mrs Davies was officially reprimanded. The decision was signed off by Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling and the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge.

But the 65-year-old former chairman of the bench said her position was made ‘untenable’ following a ‘back-to-work’ interview, during which she says she was repeatedly asked to resign by senior colleagues. She quit last week.

Mrs Davies said: ‘I feel disgusted and let down. I was in the business of ensuring justice prevailed but there is absolutely no justice in what has happened to me.

‘I could not go back into an organisation where I felt I was being gagged  and pilloried for speaking out about a substance which is illegal in this country.

‘I feel devastated that I have given the magistracy 14 years of my life and spoken about my brother’s death hundreds of times helping hundreds of offenders and this is how I am repaid. It is despicable.’

In August last year, Mrs Davies, who also works as a psychotherapist and mental health counsellor, spoke out about the death of her brother while sentencing Christopher Duncan, 55, to 200 hours unpaid work for growing cannabis.

Mrs Davies, told how her family went through a ‘living hell’ after her brother Glen Harding died aged 39.

He developed epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression following years of smoking cannabis and was found dead in a canal in 1997.

Following the hearing,  and Mrs Davies’ interviews in local and national media, the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC) launched an investigation into the way she had expressed her personal views on the case.

This was triggered by complaints from three retired  magistrates and a pro-cannabis campaigner who asked for Mrs Davies to be removed from her position immediately. Mrs Davies was then suspended.

However, after a ten-month investigation the OJC opted only to reprimand her.

Then, during a back-to- work interview, she claims requests were made for her resignation by a justice clerk and a liaison judge and she resigned on Friday.

Mrs Davies said: ‘I was suspended immediately and it was made very clear that I wasn’t going to be receiving any support.

‘I just felt incredibly shocked and upset at the way I was being treated. I had not committed a criminal act – I was genuinely trying to help others.’

The decision to suspend and investigate Mrs Davies was criticised by an anti-social behaviour reduction charity.

Nick Buckley, who runs Mancunian Way, said: ‘We find that  it’s not until someone dealing drugs meet families and victims caught up in the trade that things change.

‘I think the way this magistrate has spoken to this defendant is right. She might not be following the rule book exactly but it’s these personal stories which will reach someone.’

And Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, also voiced support for Mrs Davies.

She said: ‘It is extremely  sad that Yvonne Davies has chosen to resign over this issue, but she has done a  service in highlighting the dangers that cannabis can pose to those who are vulnerable to mental illness.

‘There is a growing body of evidence linking cannabis, especially in its strong form skunk, to mental illness, with all the damage that can inflict on individuals and their families.’

In a statement the OJC confirmed that Mrs Davies was made subject to an investigation following the ‘expression of personal views in court’ and subsequent media interviews.

A statement read: ‘The investigation found the views expressed in court were inappropriate.

‘The Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice agreed and concluded that her combined actions fell below the standard of behaviour expected of a magistrate and have issued Mrs Davies with a reprimand.’

Mrs Davies, who lives with her husband Ernie, 65, in Partington, Greater Manchester, remained defiant last night.

She said: ‘It is ludicrous that as a magistrate I cannot cite a personal experience where there have been devastating consequences because of cannabis abuse.

‘It is also doubly astounding that the views of a pro-cannabis campaigner were used to build a case against me. As far as I am aware, cannabis is still very much illegal in Britain.

‘But I don’t regret any of it and I would speak out again about the dangers of using drugs. My brother lost his life because of it and if I can save others from the devastation it causes I will.

‘When I spoke out I received dozens of letters of support from families whose children were abusing drugs telling me that they were grateful – even just for those it was worth it.’
