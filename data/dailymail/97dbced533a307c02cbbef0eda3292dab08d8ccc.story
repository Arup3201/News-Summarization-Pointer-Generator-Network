A warehouse in Swindon has installed a 'hole-in-the-ground' toilet to cater for foreign workers, according to reports.

Employees from eastern Europe apparently prefer squatting while using the loo, prompting managers to order a new toilet to match their requirements.

Bosses at the DHL warehouse are also said to be infuriated after workers broke the traditional loo seat by squatting on it.

The distribution centre in Swindon, which transports goods for B&Q, has spent thousands of pounds on the new facility, according to The Sun.

Managers had previously installed signs instructing employees not to squat on the toilet.

A source told the paper: 'Staff have been fed up with the toilet seats breaking and workers leaving a mess.'

DHL did not respond to a request for comment.

Squat toilets are rarely seen in the UK despite their popularity in many other countries around the world.

British tourists in France frequently complain that only 'hole-in-the-ground' facilities are available in restaurants and service stations.

And in some Asian countries, such as India and Japan, British-style toilets were virtually unknown until relatively recently.

However, squat loos may be set to gain in popularity in Britain, thanks to doctors who claim that the squatting posture brings health benefits.

Some medics believe that squatting while going to the toilet is a more 'natural' position, and could protect against disease.
