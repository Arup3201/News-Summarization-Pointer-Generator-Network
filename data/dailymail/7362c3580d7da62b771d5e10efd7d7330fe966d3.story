George Lucas has spent £9million on buying and restoring an Italian convent.

Although the Star Wars director bought the property in 2009, the purchase has only just become public.

The inhabitants of Passignano sul Trasimeno, in Umbria in central Italy, kept Lucas's presence a secret until last week.

The Hollywood legend's new home was built in the 16th century as a Capuchin convent, and occupied by monks until 1966.

By the time Lucas bought the property, it was worth £5.2million.

He has spent several millions more on renovating the buildings, with only the 13th century church remaining unchanged.

Renovations included a billiards room, swimming pool and even a spa.

He is believed to have invited some of his Hollywood friends round for a tour a few weeks ago: Robert De Niro, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard and Francis Ford Coppola all stayed together at the convent.

While they were there, Lucas showed 
them his latest film - a documentary about the property's restoration, 
screened in the building's new cinema.

Locals
 are reluctant to talk about Lucas, who rarely ventures outside his 
grounds, barring an occasional walk on the shore of Lake Trasimeno, 
which is overlooked by the town.

However, they did reveal that the 
director and his wife sometimes order enormous quantities of ice cream 
from the village, to cater for parties.

'For
 us it means work,' said one Passignano resident to an Italian 
newspaper.

'The presence of these gentlemen is useful to the community.'

The mayor of the village, Claudio Bellaveglia, was more forthcoming, according to the Sunday Times.

'We respected his wish,' he said.

'If we'd betrayed him, we'd have behaved like provincials.'

The
 mayor added that he had been invited to the convent for the first time 
since his childhood, and was particularly impressed by Lucas' cinema.

The next Lucas production to hit the big screen will be Red Tails, scheduled for a release next year.

It tells the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first group of African-American pilots to fly in combat squadron during World War Two.
