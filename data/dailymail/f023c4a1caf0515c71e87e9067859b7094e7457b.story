A young woman has enraged animal lovers after she beheaded a kitten and posted the bloody pictures of it on China's equivalent of Twitter

Li Pingping, a former marketing consultant, killed and dismembered the pet on Friday night less than two weeks after she bought it.

As the photos went viral on micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, Chinese 
netizens unleashed a flurry of comments calling her 'insane' and 'out of her mind.'

Li, who worked at Chengzi Culture Communication Company in Huizhou in southern China's Guangdong province, responded angrily.

She said she had vented her anger on the cat, claiming that her family had been destroyed by an extra-marital affair by her father.

She said people should 'back off' and stop judging her, fueling even more resentment. Li later deleted all her posts.

Li eventually apologised in an open letter on Monday afternoon, in which she said she abused the cat under the influence of alcohol and domestic misfortune, and that she has been living in fear and guilt over the past few days.

By Tuesday afternoon, the letter had drawn more than 60,000 comments, WantChinaTimes.com reported.

Weibo user 'Mengmengdenaier' said that the woman apologised simply because she was scared of public criticism, rather than thinking what she did was wrong.

'What you did disqualifies you as a human being,' wrote another user with the screenname 'Laojiudehuanggua.'

Some appeared to be more tolerant, saying that since the woman had apologized, they would stop criticising her.

'I just hope that the wrong way of venting emotions can be avoided in the future,' wrote Weibo user 'tubeGhost.'
