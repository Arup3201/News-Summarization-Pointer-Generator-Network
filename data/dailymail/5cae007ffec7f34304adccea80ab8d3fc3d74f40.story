Rangers say they will continue fighting the imposition of a £250,000 fine relating to undisclosed payments after losing an appeal.

The club believe they should not be forced to pay the fine, which was issued by a commission appointed by the Scottish Premier League to look into the use of Employee Benefit Trusts (EBT) at Ibrox in the first decade of this century.

A club statement read: 'Further to the announcement on 17 December 2014, Rangers Football Club Limited lost the appeal with the judicial panel of the Scottish FA on 13 January 2015 in respect of the EBT Commission fine of £250,000 levied on RFC 2012 PLC (previously The Rangers Football Club plc) (in liquidation). The club will now take the matter to arbitration.'
