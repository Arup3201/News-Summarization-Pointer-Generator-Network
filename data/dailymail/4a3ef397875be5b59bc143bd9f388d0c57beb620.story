Harsher taxes should be introduced to stop 'townies' buying second homes in the countryside and 'gutting' rural communities,  the head of the Campaign to Protect Rural England has said.

Former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion - who took over as president of the CPRE last year - said  the tax on second homes should be ratcheted up to discourage city workers from snapping up countryside properties to use as weekend retreats.

He said too many second home owner fail to contribute to the life of rural communities and simply 'scoot down' for the weekend before returning to London 'in time to catch the 10 o'clock news on Sunday night'.

'I would increase taxes on second homes to make it very expensive,' he told the Times.

'I think there's a question about whether second homes mean you have inert dormitory communities in the countryside through most of the week, very often lived in my people who scoot down in their cars, see their smart friends, don't join in the life of the community and don't feed into it,' he said.

The latest census figures show that more than 165,000 people in the UK own a second home for weekends and holidays.

Cornwall was revealed as the country's second-home capital - with 
almost 23,000 people listing a Cornish address away from their main home
where they could be found for a month or more each year.

St Ives MP Andrew George wants to see the council given authority to 
block second home owners altogether to ensure more Cornish homes stay in
the hands of local owners.

Mr George has called for the introduction of a class of 'non-permanent occupancy' for homes, meaning people buying houses to use as a holiday property would have to declare it and seek permission.

Permanent residents in the tourist hotspot say the area's popularity with city workers seeking second homes is pushing the price of housing out of the reach of local workers on comparatively lower wages.

'Local authorities need the power to curb the sheer volume of properties being transferred from family homes to holiday homes,' he said.

Other parts of the UK with high concentrations of holiday homes include Gwynedd in North Wales, North Norfolk, and the Lake District.
