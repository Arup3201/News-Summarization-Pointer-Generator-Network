It seems some drivers will go to great lengths to avoid paying fees in underground car parks.

From reversing into friends to snapping off and ploughing through boom gates, it's just another day for motorists causing havoc and damage to boom gates and even to their vehicles. 

CCTV footage from Wilson Parking has captured the reckless drivers and drunken revellers damaging boom gates in Melbourne's underground car parks.

CCTV footage shows one vehicle crashing through a boom gate to avoid paying for parking 

Some careless drivers were caught casually driving straight through the boom gate, while two vehicles were seen speeding through behind another car before the barrier moved back down.

In one piece of footage, a passerby gets hit over the head by a boom gate on its way down so he pushes it off out of anger and walks off, while two girls, who appear to be drunk, caught ripping off the barrier after a night out.

One frustrated driver is seen trying to insert her ticket through the machine several times but ends up dropping it so she crouches down to pick it up but falls flat on her face.

A male passenger is caught getting out of his seat and pushing the boom gate out of the way then he quickly runs back to the car as the driver speeds off followed by a second vehicle.

One vehicle was caught driving through the barrier but the boom gate manages to remain in one piece so the driver reverses and snaps it in half

One woman is seen standing next to the machine but her friend reverses and knocks her to the ground, while a cyclist attempted to ride through after a car but ends up getting clotheslined.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Wilson Parking Australia for comment.

Herald Sun reports boom gates cost up to $6000 to repair or replace every gate after drivers choose to crash through them instead of paying between $5 to $20 parking tickets.

The surveillance cameras operate 24 hours and seven days a week across the company's car parks, capturing every movement or crime and supplying footage to police.

Wilson Parking business development manager Simon Pearce told the Herald Sun the incidents committed lead to serious consequences.

'They have this expectation they will get away with it but we have a substantial combination of fixed and covert cameras across all of our major sites,' he said.

'Someone is not only watching you, but also recording what you are doing.

'Would you risk having police tap you on the shoulder for a $6 parking fee?'
