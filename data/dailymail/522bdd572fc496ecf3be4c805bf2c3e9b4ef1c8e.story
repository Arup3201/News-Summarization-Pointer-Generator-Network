Headstones were pushed over and vandalised with swastikas by racist thugs in a sickening attack on a Jewish cemetery.

Blackley Jewish Cemetery in Manchester was hit between 4pm on Sunday, June 22 and 3.30pm the following day, when the sickening damage was discovered.

Two 13-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence on Friday.

Racist: Nazi swastikas were scrawled on headstones at a Jewish ceremony in Manchester. Headstones were also pushed over and smashed in the attack

Now the defiant community has rallied around to clean up the cemetery. More than 100 people from different walks of life came together to help restore the site after the disgusting attack.

Harry Johnston, who helped organise yesterday’s clear-up, said it was a ‘heartwarming’ event to be involved in.

He added: 'These people have done a sterling job. We’ve had people from all different walks of society here - including Muslims, Christians and volunteers from Greater Manchester Police.

'A chap in a dog collar brought a whole bunch of people straight from a service down the road.

'It has been a really uplifting thing to watch a community battered into the floor again coil up like a spring and come back flying.'

One grave was vandalised with a white power symbol and 'Kampf', likely a reference to Adolf Hitler's book. Right, Harry Johnston, from the North Manchester Jewish Cemeteries Trust charity, inspects the damage

Mr Johnston, from the North Manchester Jewish Cemeteries Trust (NMJCT) charity, said organisers had only expected around 20 people to show up - so were overwhelmed by the turnout.

He added that so many people came that there was not enough cleaning equipment to go round - so the work had to be done in shifts.

The volunteers cleaned up the grounds of the cemetery, on Rochdale Road in Blackley, and cleared away items that had been dumped there including a refrigerator, a settee and a mattress.

Hope: A huge clean-up operation was held at the Jewish cemetery, with volunteers from numerous faiths

The damage to the headstones will take longer to repair and is the responsibility of the families affected. But Mr Johnston said wrecked children’s graves from the 1900s would be paid for by NMJCT.

He added: 'I was extremely upset by the attack and felt terrible for the families turning up after it happened. But the community has come out on top.'

The two teenagers have been bailed until July 25 pending further inquiries.

Anyone with information can call police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
