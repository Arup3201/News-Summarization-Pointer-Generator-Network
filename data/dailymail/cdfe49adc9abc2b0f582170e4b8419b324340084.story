Their thick, curly coats have earned them the nickname 'cats in sheep's clothing'.

Now the Selkirk Rex has been declared as a breed of its own by scientists, nine generations after it first appeared.

And every Selkirk Rex in the world can be traced back to one mother - Miss DePesto.

The breed can be any colour and can be long or short-haired

The kitten stood out from the rest of the litter for her unusual curly coat when she was born to a feral cat in Montana in 1987, reports Mother Nature Network.

Her curls were the result of a spontaneous gene mutation that only affected her.

Jeri Newman, a breeder of Persian cats, adopted the kitten and named her after Agnes DiPesto, the curly-haired receptionist in American television series Moonlighting, which starred Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd.

Researchers at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna say that the Selkirk Rex is genetically distinct from other breeds and is the fourth type of curly-haired cat.

The curls are caused by a dominant gene, so the felines can be cross-bred with other cats and keep its signature fur.

Unlike short-haired Cornish Rex, Devon Rex and German Rex cats, there are also long-haired varieties of the breed and their fur can come in a wide range of colours.

They are not suitable for people with allergies as they frequently shed their plush coat.
