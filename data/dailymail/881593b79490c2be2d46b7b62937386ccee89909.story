Whether you're using a state-of-the-art SLR camera or toting along your trusty smartphone, a holiday simply isn't a holiday if you're not snapping loads of photos along the way. However, each tool requires different techniques to truly get the most out of your photographs - especially if you're looking to rack up those Instagram likes online.

Experts recommend incorporating a human element into landscapes - such as a person or their property - in order to truly illustrate the grandeur of the landmark or wilderness around you. When shooting portraits, keep your subjects at eye level, or elevate them, to ensure the most flattering angle.

Time of day will also impact the quality of your snap. Dave Bouskill, founder and photographer of adventure travel blog, The Planet D, recommends shooting early in the morning or late at night. Â When the sun is setting, there will be softer light and longer shadows. Plus, if you're shooting at less desirable visiting times, you'll likely be the only one there. And while taking photographs on the beach can often pose problems when it comes to harsh bright light, using the flash is actually recommended - it will help to eliminate any dark shadows cast by hats or sunglasses.
