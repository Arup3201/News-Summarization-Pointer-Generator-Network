It was once a hubbub of activity, where shoppers would snap up seasonal steals and teens would hang out to 'look cool'.

But now White Flint Mall in Bethesda, Maryland - which opened its doors in March 1977 - looks like a modern-day mausoleum with just two tenants remaining.

Photographs taken inside the 874,000-square-foot complex show spotless faux marble floors, empty escalators and stationary elevators.

Only a couple of cars can be seen in the parking lot, where well-tended shrubbery appears to be the only thing alive.

Center of attention: Some of the first stores to open at White Flint were Bloomingdale’s and Lord & Taylor - other amenities to spark excitement among shoppers were a food court and a movie theater

The mall's owners, Lerner Enterprises and the Tower Cos., plan to eventually transform the three-story shell into a mix of residential and commercial space.

Some of the first stores to open at White Flint were Bloomingdale’s and Lord & Taylor. 

Other amenities to spark excitement among shoppers were an international food court and a movie theater.

Judy Lichtman, from the nearby town of Potomac, said she can remember the 'buzz' when the mall landed in the Seventies.

'It was amazing. We were just really impressed by everything here. It wasn't like any place we'd ever shopped at before,' she told ABC News.

But over the years dwindling business has forced a run of closures. The final closing date has not yet been announced.
