Smokers are being encouraged to attend AA-style meetings on the high street in a bid to help them quit, it has emerged.

Boots has set up free ‘Smoke Less’ clinics at more than 500 stores nationwide to encourage their customers to kick the habit.

The sessions are being run by pharmacists or healthcare assistants who have undergone training on the NHS’s stop smoking programme and also had some ‘behavioural smoking’ education to help them fully understand why people smoke and find it hard to give up cigarettes.

After an initial consultation, where the pharmacist builds up a smoking profile of the individual - for example, why they want to give up, how many cigarettes they smoke and when, a programme of nicotine replacement products, such as patches or gum, are prescribed at discounted prices.

The smoker is then urged to attend their first AA-style support group, alongside other addicts or on their own, 10 days later and encouraged to regularly attend weekly or fortnightly meetings to help them to cut down and eventually quit.

Incentives being offered to attend the clinics also include 100 extra reward points on their Boots Advantage loyalty card for each time they attend.

The sessions have been prompted following a change in guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which for the first time in June advised health professionals to talk about the benefits of ‘harm reduction’ by cutting down on cigarettes, rather than simply concentrating on forcing people to quit completely.

Previously, smokers may be forced to wait up to six months should they slip up and admit to having a cigarette before being accepted on a new NHS programme, but the ‘smoke less’ sessions recognise that relapses may occur and do not penalise people for falling off the wagon.

If a customer is found to be eligible for a stop smoking programme on the NHS they will still be referred, but will also get help from the Boots programme, allowing the pair to run alongside each other.

Lily Nichols, 35, joined one of the ‘Smoke Less’ clinics at her local High Holborn branch of Boots, central London, last month.

‘I started smoking at the age of 16 and didn’t worry about my health until I was in my early 30s,’ she said.

‘I tried the NHS program but couldn’t cut down completely in the shorter time frame, due to social situations, where the temptation was too great.

‘I wanted to start a family and knew I wasn’t the sort of person who can cut cigarettes out completely but would prefer to gradually cut down first. I’ve been to the Boots clinic three times now, and the advice and help they give you is extremely supportive.

‘I’ve not smoked for two weeks thanks to their encouragement. There was one occasion where I did slip up in the first week and they didn’t make me feel like a failure.

‘I know it’s going to be a long battle, but for the first time I actually feel that it’s achievable.’ Edward Argyle, healthcare buying manager for Boots, said the idea behind the clinics was to provide as much support as possible for smokers once they make the decision to quit or cut down.

‘Following months of customer research we identified the need for a different type of behavioural service for people who wanted to quit or cut down on their smoking, but who recognised that they needed help and support in doing so,’ he said.

‘The ‘Smoke Less’ clinics are a unique service, in the mould of Weightwatchers for slimmers and AA for alcoholics, for people who maybe find it difficult to cut cigarettes out of their lives completely straight away.

‘With the help and encouragement of our pharmacists and other smokers we hope they will be able to reduce the amount they smoke, with a view to coming off them altogether in the long run.

‘We want to help those who cut down from 20 a day to 10, or who want to stop smoking in the week, but carry on at the weekend, as well as those determined to quit completely.

‘The service is also different because we recognise relapses can and will occur and there’s no penalty for this.

Instead the clinics will provide support for those who need to get back on track. It’s all about rewarding the effort and not labelling the odd slip up as failure.’ If it proves successful the programme will be run out to more than 1,000 stores nationwide in January.
