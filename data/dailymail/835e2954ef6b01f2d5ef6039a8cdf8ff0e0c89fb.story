A former San Antonio rapper has been executed for murdering a recording studio owner in a bloody robbery.

Ray Jasper was injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital Wednesday for the November 1998 stabbing death of 33-year-old David Alejandro.

He was officially pronounced dead at 6:31pm, after addressing his daughter in his last statement.

'To my family, we are one. To my beautiful daughter, the
best thing that ever happened to me. I love you endlessly. I am
you and you are me forever,' Jasper wrote in his last words, according to a statement released by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.

No one from either his family of the victim's was present to witness the execution.

Alejandro's family decided to spend the evening together in San Antonio instead.

Jasper had acknowledged he slit Alejandro's throat to steal equipment from the San Antonio studio during a recording session, but insisted it was his two accomplices' more than 25 stab wounds that killed the studio owner. 

Co-defendant's Steve Russell and Douglas Williams were spared the death sentence and are currently serving life sentences.

Jasper's execution was the third in Texas this year. Another is set for next week before the state begins using a new batch of pentobarbital obtained through a different pharmacy.

The injection came after lawyers for Jasper, who was black, argued a black potential juror at Jasper's San Antonio trial in 2000 was questioned and disqualified improperly because of race.

Jasper's execution Wednesday night follows the publishing of an essay he wrote on the American judicial and penitentiary systems that was posted on Gawker.

Gawker initially reached out to all death row inmates with scheduled executions this year back in December 2013, and Jasper decided to respond. His original essay was published on the site in January, and they republished it two weeks before his death.

In the letter published March 4, Jasper reflected on his perceived flaws of the justice system - and even compared prisoners to slaves. 

'Under the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution all prisoners in America are considered slaves,' he wrote. 'We look at slavery like its [sic] a thing of the past, but you can go to any penitentiary in this nation and you will see slavery [...]People need to know that when they sit on trial juries and sentence people to prison time that they are sentencing them to slavery.'

Jasper's indictment described his experience of race and the judicial system, even citing the words of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur.

'When I walked into prison at 19 years old, I said to myself "Damn, I have never seen so many black dudes in my life,"' he said. 'I mean, it looked like I went to Africa. I couldn't believe it. The lyrics of 2Pac echoed in my head, "The penitentiary is packed/ and its filled with blacks."'

Referring to young African Americans, Jasper writes that in order to overcome inequalities they  'have to be exposed to something new' and ignore rap stars like Jay-Z and Rick Ross.

'Their minds have to be challenged, not dulled, he says. 'They know the history of the Crips & Bloods, but they can't tell you who Garvey or Robeson is. They can quote Drake & Lil Wayne but they can't tell you what Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton has done.'

Jasper also said that jail sentences given to first-time offenders are a form of  'oppression.'

'There are guys walking around with 200 year sentences and they're not even 30 years old,' he said. 'Its [sic] outrageous. Giving a first time felon a sentence beyond their life span is pure oppression.'

Jasper's letter even alleged that heavy sentences may be delivered as a result of the prison-industrial complex.

'The other side of the coin is there are those in the corporate world making money off prisoners, so the longer they're in prison, the more money is being made,' he said. 'It's not about crime & punishment, it's about crime & profit.'
