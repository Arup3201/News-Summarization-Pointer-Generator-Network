Liverpool are hijacking Tottenham's move for England striker Saido Berahino.

Sportsmail revealed Brendan Rodgers' intention to move for the West Bromwich Albion striker in November.

And the Anfield club's interest is gathering pace ahead of the January transfer window, that re-opens on Thursday.

The key stumbling block towards Berahino departing The Hawthorns next month remains the transfer fee.

West Brom value Berahino, who has made the breakthrough into Roy Hodgson's England squad this season, at £25million.

It is understood the Anfield club are unwilling to meet the Baggies' valuation, and will try to negotiate a lower fee.

However, with West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace known to be one of the toughest negotiators in the business, that'll be easier said than done.

Plans with regards to Liverpool's move for Berahino are said to be progressing well after Rodgers pinpointed the capture of a new striker as a January priority.

And Liverpool hope to storm ahead of Spurs in the race to land Berahino in the coming days.

Tottenham have identified Berahino as the man they want to inject life into their forward line in January after shelving plans to sign Southampton's Jay Rodriguez.

Spurs have made initial enquiries over a January switch for the forward, who has scored eight goals this season.

Southampton forward Rodriguez remains a priority transfer target for Mauricio Pochettino, but the delay in his return from a knee injury has forced Spurs into re-assessing their January plans.
