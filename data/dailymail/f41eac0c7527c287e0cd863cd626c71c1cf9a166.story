‘I am guilty. I am a pleb.’ Tory MP caught speeding in a 30mph zone says in future he will consider using the trainTory MP Michael Fabricant today revealed his ‘shock’ at being caught speeding in a 30mph zone and joked in future he will make more use of the railways.

The Lichfield MP, who was a government whip until last month’s reshuffle, told the House of Commons he was being fined by South Wales police for driving at 35mph.

He later used Twitter to admit ‘I am guilty’ before branding himself a ‘pleb’, in a swipe at beleaguered Government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell.

Mr Fabricant revealed his misdemeanour as the Commons debated improvements to Welsh railways.

He said: ‘Having just received a speeding fine from South Wales Police for going at 35mph in a 30mph zone - which was quite shocking to me this morning, I might add - may I say that this news of electrification is a great encouragement to me to use the railway in future.’

Transport Minister Simon Burns told him: ‘It just goes to show the old adage is always the best adage: let the train take the strain.’

Mr Fabricant, who has become a prolific user of Twitter since his liberation from the Whips’ Office, wrote earlier:

Beleaguered Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell arrived at the back gate of Downing Street this morning

‘Shock Horror: South Wales Police are prosecuting me for speeding at 35mph in a 30mph zone on the A4161 Newport Road. I know my place. Guilty.

‘I think I should make a personal statement to the House about my 35mph speeding penalty. I am guilty. I am a pleb. It was a speed camera.’

Mr Mitchell denies calling Downing Street police ‘f****** plebs’ in an angry rant last month after being told to get off his bike.

The row appeared to be dying down until yesterday, when Mr Mitchell heckled Ed Miliband in the Commons to insist he did not swear – despite friends earlier saying he had admitted swearing.

Mr Fabricant suggested the intervention had reignited the row.

He tweeted yesterday: ‘Oh dear. Labour were never going to let the story go away, but now he has managed to re-ignite it himself. Self-ignition?’
