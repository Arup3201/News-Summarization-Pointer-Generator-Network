The next time this woman makes a similar journey, she might well consider using a van.

The woman was pictured riding a tricycle packed with empty plastic foam boxes on West Nanjing Road in Shanghai.

As she travelled along the busy road, passing motorists and cyclists appeared completely unfazed.

Bizarre: This women rode a tricycle carrying dozens of empty plastic foam boxes through Shanghai in China

Odd: Other cyclists and motorists seemed completely unfazed as the woman passed them on the road

The tricycle was packed with more than 100 foam boxes which were held loosely together by rope to prevent them toppling over.

With the boxes piled high above the woman, it at least provided her with some shelter in case the weather conditions turned nasty.

The boxes are used to store seafood and vegetables and it is thought the woman could have been heading to a factory.

With China expanding at an astonishing rate, scenes like this can be extremely common.

It is also causing as problem for people whose properties are being surrounded by new developments.

This was highlighted in pictures which emerged today showing an isolated building which is home to a family of seven in the middle of a newly-built road.

The three-floor building stands in the middle of the Kaiyuan road in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province with the family insisting on remaining in the home.
