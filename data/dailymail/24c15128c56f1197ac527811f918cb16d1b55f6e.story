Families are taking more holidays overseas, but they are spending less when they hit the attractions and clubs.

The tightening of the purse strings which has brought reductions in supermarket spending at home appears to have continued once families board their flights for a summer break.

Spending by UK residents while on overseas visits has dipped 16per cent in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same period last year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has announced.

The spending figure, at £12.83 billion, fell despite the number of visits abroad taken by UK residents rising four per cent to 27.14 million in the first half of this year.

The fall appears to be at least partly a reflection of the fact that the pound has soared in value against most foreign currencies, which means British travellers get more for them money.

The same ONS study found that spending by foreign tourists to the UK in the first six months of this year was largely the same as the same period last year at some £8.92billion.

The first six months of 2014 have seen overseas residents making 16.41 million trips to the UK - an eight per cent rise on the January-June 2013 total.

David Edwards, head of research and forecasting at VisitBritain, said: ‘Tourism is an essential part of the wider success of our economy and these first six months have set us up for what could be another record year for inbound tourism.

‘It’s also hugely positive to see growth both from our high-volume European markets and also emerging markets across Asia and Latin America.’

Tourism minister Helen Grant said: ‘It’s fantastic that Britain’s tourism industry is performing so strongly with a record number of visits for 2014 so far . It shows the Government’s tourism strategy is working - creating more jobs, encouraging greater spend and growing the economy.'
