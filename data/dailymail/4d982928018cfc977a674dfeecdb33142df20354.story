As a star of Britain’s oldest television soap, he has been involved in some dramatic storylines.

But it is clear that Charlie Condou’s life off-screen is equally colourful.

The gay actor, who plays midwife Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, has spoken of how he became a father of two after making a pact with his straight female friend Catherine Kanter.

They agreed that if she didn’t find her ‘Mr Right’ by the time she was 40 they would embark on parenthood together.

Thrown into the equation is Mr Condou’s partner Cameron Laux, 49, with all three sharing the responsibility of raising Georgia, four, and two-year-old Hal, who were born by IVF.

Mr Condou, 40, said: ‘I always wanted to be a dad. When I came out to my parents as a teenager, their only concern was I might never be a father and they knew how much I wanted to be.

‘Catherine and I had the conversation I’m sure thousands of women have with their gay friends, a sort of plan-B pact – to have a child together should Mr Right not appear. I’d had other female friends ask me and it never felt right. But with Catherine it did.’

Mr Condou said he was lucky his family were supportive, as were Miss Kanter’s. He joked that the 45-year-old actress’s father had heard a similar story on The Archers, which had helped his understanding of what his daughter was doing.

Miss Kanter said: ‘I was never one of those women who saw a baby and thought “I want one”, but I also knew I didn’t want to not have children. 

‘When Charlie first brought up the 
subject of having kids together I wasn’t opposed to the idea, but it 
wasn’t how I wanted to do it.

‘I
still had hopes of The One appearing in a shaft of light and told 
Charlie to come back when I was 40. Then I turned 40 and Mr Right still 
hadn’t materialised, so it started to take on more meaning. I couldn’t 
shake the fear that I might hit 50 and regret not trying.

‘We had both been single when we discussed this, but then Charlie started seeing Cam. It was clear if we were to go ahead, Cam would need to be involved. And so there were three.’

Recalling their visit to the IVF clinic, Miss Kanter said it was ‘surreal – we were the only threesome in a waiting room of couples’. It took a year and four cycles of IVF before the first positive pregnancy test. Although Miss Kanter, Mr Condou and Mr Laux initially moved in together, they now live separately.

Mr Condou said the children spend half their time with him and Mr Laux at their home in Islington, North London, and the rest with Miss Kanter, who lives nearby.

Mr Condou said the only negative response appears to have come from a couple of gay friends, with ‘one accusing us of trying to fit into some kind of heterosexual stereotype’. In his professional life, he has been involved in a ‘gay dad’ storyline.

Mr Condou joined Coronation Street in 2007 as Marcus Dent, boyfriend of barman Sean Tully, but left after three years to spend more time with his daughter.

He was tempted back to the ITV soap last year to feature in a story where they looked after Sean’s son Dylan.

But in recent months viewers have seen Marcus fall in love with Maria Connor, the character’s first heterosexual relationship.

In the interview for Red magazine, Miss Kanter, who has appeared in EastEnders on TV and also works in the theatre, admitted the hardest part for her was dealing with the unexpected loneliness her circumstances brought on.

‘It felt like I spent the first 12 weeks of my pregnancy holding my breath,’ she said.

‘And I found it surprisingly lonely. Charlie and Cam had each other to bounce fears off, but I was on my own. Charlie was supportive, but it wasn’t the same. Those first months were harder than I anticipated. But we’ve all had our moments.

‘Charlie is the middleman, so he has to placate two people. And Cameron sometimes felt isolated because, biologically, it was happening to Charlie and me.

‘Towards the end of the pregnancy we agreed it made sense to be living together: practically, so we could all be hands on; emotionally so we all felt involved.’

Mr Condou added: ‘Something I realised early on is that I’ll never be the one who feels compromised: I’m in a relationship with Cameron and I’m the biological parent with Catherine, so my position is clear.

‘Catherine is single, so she doesn’t have someone to talk to about the kids in the way Cam and I do.’For Mr Laux his modern family set-up is a marriage with three people.

‘Or at least it’s like a friendly divorce, where the kids split their time between two homes!’ he said. ‘It works well, though.’
