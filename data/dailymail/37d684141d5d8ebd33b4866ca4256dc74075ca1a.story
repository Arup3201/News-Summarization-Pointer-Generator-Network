Two thieves unwittingly left a trail of evidence for their own arrest by posing for pictures in cars they had stolen.

Sam Holmes, 22, and David Leadbeater, 23, stole 35 cars worth more than £500,000 from driveways in Kent and Surrey.

Despite changing the cars' number plates to avoid detection, the burglars documented their 40-day spree by taking pictures of stolen BMWs and Audis on their mobile phones.

In one picture, Leadbeater is at the wheel of a stolen £25,000 Ford Focus ST.

He is seen to boast about selling the vehicles by posing with a wad of cash, believed to be around £5,000.

Holmes and Leadbeater, both of Eltham, south London stole keys to cars from their owner's homes, drove off and sold the vehicles on in London.

Officers from the Kent and Essex 
Serious Crime Directorate said the thieves were 'incompetent' and 'slipped 
up in every way possible'.

Maidstone Crown Court have heard how Leadbeater burgled 43 homes between May 25 and July 4 last year, stealing a total of 35 cars.

Holmes and Leadbeater changed the number plates on the stolen cars, to avoid detection by the police. Leadbeater was pulled over by officers in a stolen Mini Cooper with false number plates in Southend, Essex last July

The court heard how officers pulled over 23-year-old Leadbeater in a stolen Mini Cooper with false number plates in Southend, Essex last July.

When they searched his mobile phone they found a number of photos of him sitting in the stolen cars.

Holmes was arrested after police found photos of him in a stolen Mini Cooper on his mobile phone.

The court heard how both men had been disqualified from driving and that the majority of the cars stolen had now been recovered.

The court was also shown a photo of the pair posing together in a stolen motor, with Leadbeater wearing a pair of sunglasses and Holmes in a hoodie.

The pair initially denied all the offences, but faced with the overwhelming evidence against them - much of which they provided themselves through mobile phone potographs - they pleaded guilty to the burglaries last Friday.

The pair each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit 43 burglaries and attempted burglaries and will be sentenced later this week.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Adrian Grew said: 'Both Holmes and Leadbeater have shown no remorse for their crimes despite overwhelming evidence being found by police during this investigation.

'They may have seen themselves as successful criminals but they left an incredible trail of evidence and slipped up in every way possible - not only were they incompetent, but they have no morals either.'
