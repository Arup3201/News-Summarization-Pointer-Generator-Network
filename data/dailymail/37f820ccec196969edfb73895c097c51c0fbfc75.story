The Queen is being urged not to sign a Royal Charter drawn up by politicians to oversee regulation of the Press

A powerful group of the world’s leading Press freedom organisations has written to the Queen urging her not to sign a Royal Charter drawn up by politicians to oversee regulation of Britain’s 300-year- old free Press.

In a strongly-worded letter, they warn that the ‘toxic’ charter – written by the three major political parties and the Hacked Off lobby group – will have a ‘chilling’ effect on journalism in the UK.

But it will also be used by dictators around the world to muzzle the Press in their own countries.

They also say Britain will be unable 
to exercise a leadership role in arguing for human rights at next 
month’s Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Sri Lanka if the 
charter is approved by the Privy Council and signed by the Queen next 
Wednesday.

The letter –
signed by bodies including the World Press Freedom Committee, 
International Press Institute and Commonwealth Press Union Media Trust –
came as a poll suggested that 68 per cent of the public believed 
politicians would exploit the proposed framework to dampen criticisms 
and restrict free speech.

Only 13 per cent of those questioned by pollsters Survation for the Free Speech Network agreed the Royal Charter would result in a ‘more vibrant and independent Press’ while 62 per cent said the new system should not give politicians the final say on regulation.

This month, the three main political parties agreed the detail of a charter designed to impose a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry.

An alternative charter proposed by the Press – which would have given an independent regulator strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million, up-front corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and independence from the industry and politicians – was rejected.

It is thought to be the first time that the Queen has been asked to sign a Royal Charter forcing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry.

In their letter, the organisations told her: ‘No one should be in any doubt that the charter which politicians are forcing Your Majesty to sign is, despite the camouflage, a set of repressive statutory controls being imposed on the Press.

‘That should not be the function of a Royal Charter. By laying down rules about how that regulator must work and how the ethical codes that bind the Press should be written, this toxic charter brings Parliament for the first time ever to the heart of the newsroom.

‘It breaches the fundamental principle that politicians must never get involved in editorial content regulation. And it lays the foundation for fully fledged statutory controls.

‘That will have a chilling impact on journalism throughout the United Kingdom – from the biggest national newspapers to the smallest local and regional papers and magazines – weakening democracy.’

If the UK moves to control the Press through the law, it will have ‘a terrifying knock-on effect throughout the Commonwealth and much of the developing world where  Britain has a key leadership role’, the letter warned.

‘The fact this is being done by Royal Charter – an instrument traditionally used to grant rights – will make that infinitely worse because of the respect in which you personally, and the Crown institutionally, are held.

‘The actions of Britain’s Parliament will be used as an excuse by those who want to muzzle the Press in their own country – and there are many governments who would love to do so. And it is your name, Your Majesty, that will regrettably be taken in vain.

‘If it is good enough for the Queen, it is good enough for us.’

‘Already we have seen the chill winds of what is happening in the UK in South Africa, Botswana and Sri Lanka. Many more will follow.’

It warns the charter would be ‘seized on by enemies of free speech everywhere eager to impose similar controls’.

It added: ‘This issue is of huge importance in the UK. It is important for Britain’s standing in the world. But above all, it is important for the impact on countries not nearly so lucky as the many of us in Europe who until now have enjoyed fundamental freedoms.’

Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, who has been critical of the rival publishers’ plan, said the charter is a ‘medieval piece of nonsense’.

Speaking in a debate on Tuesday organised by the London Press Club, he condemned the cross-party regulation plan.
