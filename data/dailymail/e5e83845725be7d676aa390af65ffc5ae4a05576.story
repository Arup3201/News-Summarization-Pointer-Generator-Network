It may have only been a matter of weeks since Mayor of London Boris Johnson was left suspended precariously above the capital in a comical zip wire malfunction during the Olympics.

But Mr Johnson could be looking to take to the skies once again, this time on his bike, as he considers an architect's proposals for a network of elevated cycle paths between London's mainline stations.

Spectacular artist's impressions of what the city's raised cycle network - given a working name of SkyCycle - could look like were released this week along with the first details of the project.

London Mayor Boris Johnson is considering architect Sam Martin's designs for SkyCycle, a bike network above the capital's streets. An artist's impression is shown

The scheme is designed to make cycling safer for the increasing numbers choosing to take their bike to work

Drawings showing a futuristic raised
 glass open-top tunnel, that have drawn comparisons with New York's High
 Line, could become a reality as soon as 2015.

Sam
 Martin, 43, the landscape architect who came up with the idea with a 
colleague two years ago, said discussions between the Mayor and Network 
Rail were 'going well' since an initial meeting in May and that 
feasibility studies over potential sites were already underway.

He
 stressed that plans were at an early stage, but the proposal was 
focused on commuters who would pay to use the network with an Oyster 
card.

Mr Martin, director of Exterior 
Architecture, who admits to giving up cycling in London because he found
 it too dangerous added that the raised network was the only option left
 to expand cycling in London.

He said: 'TfL estimate the 
number of journeys made by bike will treble to around 1.5 million by 
2020. Where are they meant to go? SkyCycle is the next logical step, 
because you can’t realistically build more cycle lanes on ground level.

'You have to start knocking down 
buildings and there will always be the problem of traffic. It will be 
less safe than it is now and you can’t persuade people to get on bikes 
as it is even if you keep raising taxes on cars.'

He added: 'Boris loves the idea and 
Network Rail are really positive about it. I sincerely believe it could 
be the next significant piece of London infrastructure and would 
transform the capital.

'It has been compared to New York’s High Line,
 which I am familiar with, but the reality is this is a completely 
different concept.

'In New York it is mainly pedestrian and primarily for tourists and uses converted disused railway lines.

Boris Johnson, right, is considering architect Sam Martin's ambitious SkyCycle design

'We are talking about new 
infrastructure for commuters that guarantees safety and will be quicker 
than taking public transport. It is a much more ambitious and 
expensive.'

The drawings show a bold red and blue design incorporating a helix structure partly encasing the raised platform above London.

Martin believes that a corporate sponsor similar to the Barclays-backed cycle hire scheme would be needed to help fund the project, which he said would cost 'tens of millions of pounds' and take around two years to build.

It is thought the first route could be built on the Olympic regeneration of east London, linking Stratford with the City of London through Liverpool and Fenchurch Street stations but this has yet to be confirmed

It is envisaged that cyclists could pay around £1 per journey, making it significantly cheaper to use than public transport - around the third of the cost of a regular commute.

Sam Martin, 43, hopes that his design will make London safer for cyclists

There would also be the need for more cycle storage and ramps at stations. 

Despite suggestions, Martin said the proposed network would not exclusively use old railway lines but would require new infrastructure build alongside or above tracks in some places.

The problem of negotiating with different landowners is to be overcome by using leasing land owned by Network Rail.

The SkyCycle idea has drawn comparisons with New York's High Line, pictured, which uses the city's old railway lines as walkways

Speaking about the idea recently Boris Johnson MP described it as 'very interesting'.

He said: 'There is a proposal, which is very interesting, to hook up mainline stations in London along the side of raised railway tracks, with a new cycle path.'

According to TfL, there were twice the number of cyclists in London in 2010 compared to 2000, sparking numerous campaigns for improvements to make cycling safer in the capital.
