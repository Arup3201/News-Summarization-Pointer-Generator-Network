Ander Herrera may be looking to impress new manager Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, but the current Premier League boss he idolised as a youngster will surprise many.

The midfielder, a summer acquisition from Athletic Bilbao, has admitted that during his Real Zaragoza days he looked up to Gus Poyet.

Poyet enjoyed seven years in Spain before his move to the Premier League where he is now in charge of Sunderland, and impressed Herrera as well as Xavi and Andres Iniesta at Barcelona.

Legends: Herrera also praised the way Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt patrolled the midfield for United

However, Herrera has also waxed lyrical about Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, and will be looking to become another fine central midfielder at United.

'I always looked at other players at Real Zaragoza as that's where I played [as a youngster]. Gus Poyet was a role model for me, and then the national team players like Xavi and Iniesta but so were the United players like Scholes and Butt,' he told MUTV.

'They not only played well with the ball, they did great work off the ball too and worked hard to defend when they needed to. They were all big role models for me.'

Herrera has been in fine form during pre-season, and started in United's pre-season victory against Valencia on Tuesday.

He is expected to make his Premier League bow this weekend, with Swansea the visitors at Old Trafford.
