Fresh off inauguration to a second full term, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is going to war with his state's universities, proposing at $300 million reduction to their funding in his annual budget.

The 2.5 percent cut in funding to Wisconsin's 13 public universities would consume the budgets of at least five colleges on the flagship Madison campus, that location's chancellor has said - and then some.

The move sets up Walker, a presumed Republican presidential candidate, for a nasty political fight at home just as he turns his attention to the national stage.

Back on the attack: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, now in his second term, is taking on his state's university system. He wants to cut $300 million - setting up for another nasty political fight with public employees. In 2012 he was forced to compete in a recall election after he enraged Democrats with legislation that curbed collective bargaining rights for most of the state's employees

Hundreds of students and faculty members at the Madison campus have already begun protesting, the Washington Post reports. 

And last night, the Milwaukee Teachers' Education Association and other teachers' groups staged a demonstration outside the 47-year-old governor's parents' home that a local news publication said brought out more than 100 people.

Walker is beginning his second term with the same type of bold action that incited Democrats to try to have him thrown out of office less than a year into his tenure as governor.

After Walker championed legislation that curbed the collective bargaining rights of most of public employees, state workers, with the backing of local and national unions, sought to have him recalled.

Groups as large as 100,000 gathered to protest the 'Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill' - Republicans' answer to the state's $3.6 billion budget deficit. 

Against all odds, Walker became the first U.S. governor to keep the keys to the executive mansion in 2012 when Wisconsin voters again elected him. 

The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in June 2014 that the legislation was legal, and in November Walker was elected to lead the state for a third time.

Picking another fight, Walker is now asking the Republican-led Wisconsin legislature to slash funding for the state's publicly-run higher education institutions in exchange for a two-year tuition freeze and the relinquishment of authority to university officials to control staff pay and campus construction projects.

'It’s very much like what we did four years ago,' Walker said during a forum in London last week, according to the Washington Post.

Half of the annual savings would be passed on to taxpayers, the governor's office has said. 

'Governor Walker is proposing to provide the University of Wisconsin System with the authority and flexibility that it has been seeking for years, while freezing tuition for two years to maintain college affordability for our state’s hard-working families,' a spokesman for Walker told the New York Times. 

'These reforms will give the U.W. System the power to transform higher education in this state for the future by empowering leaders, protecting taxpayers and promoting long-term stability.'

The measure, if passed, would have the short-term effect of forcing the University of Wisconsin- Madison to layoff teachers, the campus's chancellor, Rebecca Blank, told the Times.

Blank also raised the possibility of out-of-state tuition increases. And even if she eliminated the schools of business, law, nursing, pharmacy and veterinary medicine, Blank told the Times that still wouldn't cover UW-M's portion of the deficit.

The Madison university is urging nearly a half million of alumni to contact Walker's office and beg him to renege on his plan. 

Last night activists swarmed a home belonging to Walker's parents that protesters and news reports mistook for Walker's personal residence and chanted, 'Hey hey, ho ho, Scott Walker’s got to go.'

'The students united will never be defeated,' they shouted, FOX6 said, and, 'Students are not for sale.'

'He brought budget cuts to all our houses, and today we brought it to his,' Wisconsin Jobs Now Director Jennifer Epps-Addison told local publication Wauwatosa Now.

One of Walker's sons, Matt, said on Twitter, however that his grandparents live in the home, not his father, the governor.

Walker added Marquette University as a student but left before he graduated to take a job with the American Red Cross. But one of his two sons, Alex, attends the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

At the London event Walker noted that his opponents wrongly predicted the 2011 law 'would be the death of public education in my state.'

'Back then I had two kids in public high schools, and I said I have a vested interest then, just like I do now in the UW system,' he stated. 'With our authority, the same thing will happen with the University of Wisconsin system.'

Democratic State Sen. Jennifer Shilling, minority leader of the Wisconsin legislature's upper chamber,' accused Walker of allowing his political ambitions to creep into his responsibilities as the state's chief executive.

His budget, she told the Post, 'looks like a presidential document.'

'Don’t underestimate the intelligence of Wisconsinites: They know this is fodder for a presidential campaign,' Shilling said.

Walker is not term limited and could take another go at governor in 2018 if he doesn't win the presidency in 2016 - assuming he runs. 

While he hasn't made official his campaign, Walker's interest in the presidency is well-established His leadership PAC recently brought on two respected Republican Party aides, and last month when he visited Iowa, the first state to hold a presidential election each cycle, he promised to come back.
