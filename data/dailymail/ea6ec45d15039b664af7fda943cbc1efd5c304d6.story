An elderly homeless man watched in tears as the home he'd built in the woods six years before was torn down by police.

Sam's eyes filled up as he silently watched the sturdy, wooden structure  bulldozed along with his carefully tended garden trimmed with a white picket fence.

Until last month, Sam lived in a woodland camp of 80-100 people, known as Tent City, on the edge of Lakewood Township, New Jersey.

Sam, who has lived his little wooden home in the woods for six years, watched as Lakewood Township police move in to supervise the demolishing of his home

A bulldozer was brought in to crush the home which was one of the last left standing in a community known as Tent City

The home was demolished after the Tent City community was evicted by the township in order to protect wetlands, Lakeland Township has claimed

Sam, who grew up in foster care and has lived his whole life close to nature, watched as his home was destroyed. As part of a legal settlement with the people of Tent City, Lakewood Township had him rehoused in a motel for one year 

His home was bulldozed at the end of June after a long-running legal battle between Lakewood Township and the homeless came to an end.

Around five years ago, Lakewood Township sued the people of Tent City in order to evict them from the land.

The township has claimed that the woodlands were endangered wetlands and the trees and environment must be protected. 

But still there are unconfirmed suspicions that building work is being planned for where the camp once stood.

MailOnline reached out to Lakewood Township Mayor and Planning Department with messages today but received no response at the time of publication.

Following the intervention of a powerful, Manhattan litigation attorney, Jeff Wild, the homeless community counter-sued the township.

They reasoned that their camp needed to exist because there was no homeless shelter in Ocean County, New Jersey. 

After a long-running battle, the case was finally settled last year. Each person in the camp was offered temporary housing for a year to leave Tent City or a cash settlement of $3,500.

The home and its fenced garden were flattened by the bulldozer at the end of June. The community had been standing in the woods for eight years

Sam was one of the last to leave. He had grown up in foster care system and as a young child, had often run away into the woods to live. 

Without a family structure, Sam had grown comfortable living close to nature and had come to Tent City for its sense of community.

He had asked the police officers, with whom the people of Tent City had a close bond, if they would allow him to watch his little home being torn down.

They stood alongside him as they bulldozer crushed the home and hoisted it into a dumpster. 

Sam, for the next year at least, lives in a motel. 

Jack Ballo, who made film Destiny's Bridge about Sam and the community at Tent City's battle to save their homes, told MailOnline today: 'Sam had lived off the land before. He's a friendly, intelligent and hard-working guy.

'He doesn't drink and he doesn't do drugs. He just wanted to live in the way that he liked. It's sad because he belonged out there.' 

Mr Ballo spent a year with the community of Tent City, documenting their lives and what brought them to live in the woods.

The council were fair to the homeless, he said, by moving them one by one over a year-long period and proving them with temporary shelter. They also helped with furniture and utilities.

However people also lost a sense of community with their family, friends and neighbors that had built up over eight years in the woods. 

Mr Ballo said: 'What would have been good would be to give these people the support they needed - social work, job training - things that could help them back on their feet and into society.'

Many people in Tent City, like Sam, had chosen to live there instead of sleeping on the streets or in an endless cycle of temporary shelters.

Although the authorities deemed the woodland camp 'temporary', many of the homeless people living there saw it as their home and a place to belong

One resident was a keen piano player at the camp, entertaining other residents. His playing has been captured as part of new film Destiny's Bridge which documents the lives of those who live at Tent City

Others in the community were battling drug and alcohol addictions while some were struggling with mental illnesses.  

The film-maker said: 'A lot of homeless people have gone through things where they don't have family or friends or any support. Often they are alone in their world. 

'But Tent City gave them that support - it gave them community and it gave them a sense of belonging and ownership.'

Lakewood Township police Lt. Joseph Goertz  confirmed to MailOnline today that the homeless at Tent City had been relocated to temporary housing.

He said: 'A lot of the population were using alcohol and drugs. It transpired there were some less than glowing things going on.'

The officer admitted that although there was no homeless shelter in Lakewood Township, there was a place in Tom's River ten miles away.

 The film Destiny's Bridge focuses on the Lakewood Township homeless but as Mr Ballo pointed out, tent cities are springing up across the U.S.

The National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty pooled media reports on tent cities over five years and found that as of 2013, there were 100 tent communities in the U.S. And that number is growing.   

There are more than 630,000 people living homeless in the U.S., according to recent figures from the National Alliance To End Homelessness. 

Destiny's Bridge is a concept by New Jersey minister Steve Brigham who believes in creating new housing solutions to deal with homelessness.

It has also led to the growth of the tiny house movement which Mr Ballo pointed to as an alternative to tent cities.

However despite their popularity, the homes have run into problems over strict laws on building codes and zoning.

Mr Ballo, who previously made films about impoverished communities of the Dominican Republic, believes that the U.S. may have something to learn from such third world societies when it comes to its own burgeoning homelessness dilemma.

He said: 'It didn’t take me long to realize that the answer to poverty in the United States is no different then it is in the poorest areas around the world. 

'Maybe this country needs to provide the opportunity for the poor to live a simple life with basic necessities.

'Isn’t it the American way to allow a person to build a house that they can afford? Our society has become accustomed to creating laws and regulations that forbid people from living a simple life.'
