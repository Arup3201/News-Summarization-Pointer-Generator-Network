A West Virginia gunman who murdered four before people before killing himself on Monday seems to have targeted individuals he felt had betrayed him.

Jody Lee Hunt, 39, of Westover, killed Doug Brady, Sharon Berkshire, Michael Frum and Jody Taylor on Monday morning before being found dead himself that evening in a 2011 Ford F-150 parked in the middle of a clearing.

Now it is being revealed that Brady was a rival business owner, Berkshire was his ex-girlfriend, and that Frum and Taylor had both had relationships with Berkshire.

What's more, Taylor is Hunt's cousin.

Victim: Hunt's second victim was his ex-girlfriend Sharon Berkshire (above) who he had been in contact with as recently as last week

Lovers: The last two victims were Jody Taylor (left) and Michael Frum (right) who had both had relationships with Berkshire

It all began on Monday morning when Hunt drove to Doug's Towing in Westover between 9 and 10am and shot 45-year-old Brady twice in the head while he was working on a vehicle. 

Hunt had been complaining at county meetings over the past few months that Brady had been getting tow jobs illegally according to Monongalia County commissioner Tom Bloom.

From there he drove to a home in Cheat Lake where he shot dead both 39-year-old ex-girlfriend Berkshire and her current lover, 28-year-old Frum. 

Frum had reportedly been taunting Hunt with text messages about his relationship with Berkshire. 

Berkshire had previously filed two orders of protection against Hunt, once in 2013 and once last month, and also filed a domestic violence case against him last month.

Both orders of protection had been dropped shortly after they were filed.

Hunt had been in contact with Berkshire as recently as last week, writing on her Facebook page on Thanksgiving, 'Love doesn’t judge excepts [sic] you as you are. Missing u!'

Murder-suicide: After killing the four victims, Hunt shoot himself in the head

His last victim was also a former lover of Berkshire, and his cousin, 43-year-old Taylor, who also used to be a co-owner of Hunt's towing business, J&J Towing.

Hunt shot him point blank in Taylor's front yard as Taylor's mother, his aunt, looked on from the doorway of their home.

'I heard a shot. Three of them went off until I could get to the door. I said "Jody, you okay Jody?”' Cassandra Taylor told WTAE. 

'And I said "Sir, what are you doing?" And he finished shooting and he took off in his truck. Didn’t look up at me or nothing.'

She also said that though there was bad blood between the two men, she was shocked by what happened.

'He had a grudge against my son, and my son had a grudge against him. Jody Hunt had to use a gun, he couldn’t come and talk like he should’ve.'

Hunt took to his Facebook on Monday in what seemed to be an attempt to explain his actions.

In his first post he wrote; 'My actions were not right nor were the actions of those who tried to tear me down and take from me. This was not the plan but a struggle to see that those who strives to hurt me received their fair pay of hurt like I received...You will not hurt me any more. You will not destroy my soul and heart as you tried so hard to do.'

He later wrote another post that said; 'I hope that everyone takes the words I love you seriously. Be honest with the one you are with. No need for a game. You either want them or u don't. Just tell them no need to lead there heart on. I'm so sorry for my actions today and the lives I've effected. I'm so tired of the wrong doers getting by with all of it. No need for games. Life is short. Love the one you are with.' 

According to court records, Hunt had previously been charged with abduction and illegal use of a firearm in 1999.
