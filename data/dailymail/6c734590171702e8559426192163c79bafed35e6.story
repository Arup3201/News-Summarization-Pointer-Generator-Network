H IS FOR HAWK by Helen MacDonald (Jonathan Cape £14.99)

Five months after Helen Macdonald’s father died, she found herself pacing anxiously up and down a Scottish quayside, a cigarette in one hand, a can of Irn-Bru in the other, and an envelope containing £800 in £20 notes stuffed into her back pocket. The shy poet and historian felt like a drug dealer.

Then she saw the man she’d come to meet, struggling with an enormous cardboard box that was lurching and thumping strangely in his arms.

As he leaned forward to open it, she saw dried blood around a nasty gash on his wrist. And, suddenly, the female goshawk she had ordered burst out, in a furious clatter of wings and talons.

Macdonald’s heart jumps sideways. To her, the bird is ‘a conjuring trick. A reptile. A fallen angel’. She hopes that the intense concentration required to tame such a wild creature will help cure her grief.

Bereavement happens to everyone, notes Macdonald, but you feel it alone. She likens it to somebody walking into a room containing your whole family, and punching each member individually, hard in the stomach.

‘So, the thing is, you all share the same kind of pain, exactly the same, but you’re too busy experiencing total agony to feel anything other than completely alone,’ she says.

Macdonald’s father, Alisdair, was a successful photo-journalist, ‘a quiet man in a suit, who had set out each day in search of things that were new, who had captured the courses of stars and storms and streets and politicians’.

In 2007, he set out to photograph storm-damaged buildings in Battersea, and died of a sudden heart attack. The last photo on his camera is blurred, taken from a low angle, far too low, in an empty, London street.

A few days later, there’s a strange family outing as Helen, her mother and brother walk the streets, looking for his car. It has been towed. They must provide his death certificate before the fine can be waived.

This is the car she drives to Scotland to collect her goshawk: his equipment still rattling around in the boot. From him, she’s inherited her ability to wait patiently and pay attention to the details of the world around her.

As a small child, she would hide beneath a rhododendron bush on the hill behind her house and watch the world like a tiny sniper: ‘basking in the fierce calm that comes from being invisible, but seeing everything’. Macdonald says this drive toward ‘watching, not doing’ has not served her well in life.

‘Not with people and loves and hearts and homes and work. But in the first few days with a new hawk, making yourself disappear is the greatest skill in the world.’

She trained her first raptor — a kestrel called Amy — when she was 13, then moved on to merlins and peregrine falcons.

Before becoming a Cambridge academic, she’d trained birds for Arab sheiks. But she’d always stayed away from goshawks — historically disdained by aristocratic falconers as the ruffians of the bird world, hunting in short, inelegant stabs and unfussy about their prey. Bigger and bulkier than the sparrowhawks that snatch pigeons from suburban lawns, goshawks are the ‘dark grail’ of the bird- watcher’s world.

Although gamekeepers persecuted them to extinction in the UK by the end of the 19th century, they were successfully reintroduced in the Sixties. The females are so fearsome that breeders have to keep them in separate aviaries to the males — they will slay them if introduced at the wrong moment.

In choosing a female goshawk as the companion to her grief, Macdonald is seeking a creature as overwhelmingly brutal as her emotions. But the bird she christens Mabel turns out to be a remarkably calm hawk, settling into life in urban Cambridge with admirable ease.

It is bizarre to picture such a cool-eyed predator taking her first meat from her new trainer in a brightly-lit lounge with ’Allo! ’Allo! on the television.

Although there is one terrifying scene, in which Mabel’s talons cause blood to gush from between Macdonald’s eyes, the hawk also surprises the human by playing — retrieving balls of crumpled- up paper in her deadly, Baker- lite beak.

The 21st-century woman’s account of her mutually successful cohabitation with Mabel runs parallel to her sensitive analysis of T. H. White’s celebrated 1951 memoir The Goshawk.

In that, the author of The Once and Future King (the Arthurian classic Disneyfied as The Sword in the Stone) retreats with fantasies of primitive survivalism from an unhappy existence as a schoolmaster to hole up in rural isolation with a goshawk.

While Macdonald admits she wants to learn from her hawk how to become ‘numb to the hurts of human life’, White locked himself into mutually destructive battle of wills with ‘Gos’, — replaying the shame and terror of a traumatic childhood, during which both his parents made regular threats to kill him.

He drives himself half-mad trying to stay awake for days on end with his bird, spoils the hawk with too much meat, and tries repeatedly to break the spirit he so admires. He becomes his own sadistic father.

At times, he even feels he has become a hawk. During one chase, his hawk grabs a rabbit, and White pins the animal’s skull to the grass with a hunting knife.

‘Think of Lust,’ wrote White, who struggled to ‘cure’ his homosexuality with psychotherapy. ‘Real blood-lust is like that.’

But for Macdonald — who understandably prefers hawk-caught meat to the flesh of sad, battery-raised animals — the kill is the point where bird and woman separate.

‘Hunting makes you animal,’ she writes, ‘but the death of an animal makes you human.’

Unlike White, she has friends and family to help her through her distress. And she takes anti-depressants. She ends her exquisitely written book safe in the knowledge that her pain is a separate thing from her bird.

Mabel’s talons have left thin, white scars on her hands. But hands, she realises, ‘are for other human hands to hold. They should not be reserved exclusively as perches for hawks.’
