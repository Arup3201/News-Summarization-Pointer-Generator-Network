They set off in the early hours of D-Day, never to return.

The crew of the Lancaster bomber – among the most highly decorated in the RAF – were all killed when their plane was shot down by a German aircraft over Normandy. Their remains have never been found.

Now, 68 years later, thanks to the chance discovery of a gold ring, the mystery has been solved.

In a spin: One of the propellers of the Lancaster, which was found at the newly-discovered crash site

Ring: A metal detector found a gold ring which bore the initials ‘AC’ and the engraved inscription ‘Love Vera’

A piece of history: Tony Graves (right, pictured with a German bullet found at the crash site) discovered the AC referred to ‘Albert Chambers’ (left) who wed Vera Grubb, 21, just eight months before he died on D-Day

Marriage certificate: Albert Chambers and Vera Grubb, who wed at a church in Normanton, Derbyshire, in 1943

Luftwaffe ace: Oberleutnant Helmut Eberspacher in his German Foker-Wulf 190. He shot down the RAF Lancaster over Normandy on D-Day

'We were at war and the enemy had to be combated': Eberspacher wrote in his log of shooting down three Lancasters that day

The mangled ring, found in a marsh by a
 French metal detector enthusiast, bears the initials ‘AC’ and the 
engraved inscription ‘Love Vera’.

British aviation archaeologist Tony 
Graves believes the AC refers to a flight lieutenant called Albert 
Chambers who was on board Lancaster ND 739 which went missing following a
 dawn mission on June 6, 1944.

The name Vera refers to his wife, Vera Grubb, whom he had married just eight months earlier.

Born in Derby, Flight Lieutenant 
Chambers had an extraordinary career. He had flown 58 operational 
sorties and had won a Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar before his 
death at 23.

Chambers was 97 Squadron’s signals leader and was wireless operator and air gunner on the D-Day flight.

He had flown Stirling bombers and as a
 20-year-old he was forced to bale out over England when his aircraft 
ran out of fuel returning from Hanover after it was attacked by German 
fighters.

Mr Graves has found hundreds of 
twisted parts from the Lancaster as well as a string of personal items, 
including a silver-plated cigarette case and a watch.

Big project: Excavating machines dig a 25ft hole on September 29 at the crash site of the Lancaster in France

Uncovered: Aviation historian Gordon Ramsey holds one of the propellers of missing Lancaster ND 739

Dig team: The wreck is believed to be of the Lancaster which was sent on a  dawn mission to attack a German coastal battery at Pont Du Hoc in the crucial hours before the Allied invasion on June 6, 1944

Amazing discovery: Aviation historian Mark Kirby uncovers a tyre from the wreckage of the Lancaster

Astonishing: A piece of fuselage which still has traces of red paint from the RAF Lancaster call sign Z-Zebra

Well-built: A parts tag from an engine carburetor of the RAF Lancaster, which was shot down by a German

In hand: An airman's glove which has been recovered from the French field by the archaeologists

Big dig: The dramatic discovery of the missing Lancaster was made by Mr Graves, who has excavated more than 400 Battle of Britain aircraft and spent years pinpointing the exact spot

Holding history: A digging volunteer finds a piece of undercarriage from the RAF Lancaster in the field

The bomber was piloted by Wing 
Commander ‘Jimmy’ Carter. His seven-man crew boasted four Distinguished 
Flying Crosses and three Distinguished Flying Medals for gallantry 
between them.

They had taken off from RAF Coningsby 
 in Lincolnshire at 2.56am on D-Day and carried out a bombing mission at
 Pointe du Hoc on the coast of Normandy.

But their plane came under fire from 
Luftwaffe pilot Oberleutnant Helmut Eberspacher, shortly after 5am as he
 shot down three Lancasters in five minutes.

This Lancaster is one of only two airworthy Lancasters in the world still flying. She wears the markings of EE139 ' The Phantom of the Ruhr'  100 squadron

Deadly: The newly discovered Lancaster wreck was shot down by a pilot flying a Focke-Wulf, like the one pictured

The aircraft’s last contact came at 
5.04am acknowledging a message from a controller, before falling silent.

Eberspacher was scrambled to patrol the Normandy coast in his 
Focke-Wulf 190 fighter as a wave of RAF bombers headed towards their 
target.

Carter and his crew had successfully completed their mission and turned for home when their  plane came under fire.

French farm workers watched as the 
bomber descended in flames, but the crash site near Carentan in Normandy
 had remained undiscovered.

The other crew members who died were 
Squadron Leader Martin Bryan-Smith, Flight Lieutenant Henry Jeffery, 
Acting Flight Sergeant Guy Dunning, Acting Flight Sergeant Frank Watson,
 Australian Flight Lieutenant Ronald Conley, and Canadian Flight 
Lieutenant Herbert Rieger.

The men are all listed on the  Runnymede memorial which commemorates the 20,389 World War Two airmen with no known graves.

Amazed: Archaeologist Mr Graves with pieces of clothing and crew belongings which were recovered

Mr Graves was informed of the  
discovery of the gold ring around nine months ago. He said: ‘When I got 
to the spot I found about 300 rounds of British .303mm ammunition still 
lying on the surface.

‘We’ve recovered one of the 
Lancaster’s huge wheel hubs, the back of an armour-plated crew seat and 
all the bomb rack clamps.’ He also found a clutch of blood-stained maps 
and four parachutes.

But Mr Graves said it was the personal effects of the courageous crew that were the most moving.

From abroad: The crew included two Commonwealth 
flyers - Canadian bomb aimer Flt Lt Herbert Rieger (left), of Hamilton, 
Ontario, and Australian navigator Flt Lt Ronald Conley (right), of 
Annerley, Queensland

Heroes: The Lancaster was piloted by Wing 
Commander Jimmy Carter (left), who also had Squadron Leader Martin

Remembered: A message (right) left at the 
Runnymede Missing in Action memorial for Flt Lt Henry 'Hank' Jeffery 
(left) by his sister Doris. Flt Lt Jeffery was one of the crew on the RAF 
Lancaster

He said: ‘We’ve found a couple of torn
 RAF woollen jumpers, with one still bearing a DFM medal  ribbon.

'Lodged
 inside the sleeve of one jumper we discovered a single German 7.92mm 
bullet.

‘There is an officer’s forage cap, a 
pocket from an RAF tunic with a Waterman pen still clipped inside and a 
silk flying glove.’

Teamwork: Local people and volunteer workers use excavating machines to dig a 25ft hole in the French field

In his log of D-Day, Eberspacher 
wrote: ‘We were at war and the enemy had to be combated, and I was in a 
favorable flying position.

'Within a few minutes, three British Lancaster bombers went down in flames.’

The discovery comes four months after 
the Queen dedicated the Bomber Command memorial in London’s Green Park 
to commemorate the 55,573 men who died  in action.
