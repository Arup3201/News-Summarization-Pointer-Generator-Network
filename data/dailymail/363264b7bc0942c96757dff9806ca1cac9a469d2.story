Immigration is responsible for 84 per cent of the surge in Britain’s population this century, a report claims today.

It suggests the true impact of immigration has been ‘substantially understated’ because the Office for National Statistics did not count 1.3million children born to foreign parents as migrants.

The report concludes that of the 4.6million population rise between 2001 and 2012, 3.8million is due to the biggest wave of immigration the country has faced. Not including children born in the UK meant net migration was recorded at a much lower 2.5million.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, pictured, said official figures underestimated the scale of immigration as they do not count the British-born children of recent migrants as immigrants 

MigrationWatch UK, the think-tank that carried out the study using official data, said it was ‘undeniable’ that migration had driven population growth, putting pressure on public services and depressing wages.

It shows how Labour’s decision at the turn of the century to make it easier for migrants to come to Britain has changed the face of the country.

In its most recent publication, the ONS said that, on average, 57 per cent of the UK’s population increase since 2001 has been due to net migration.

The statisticians, whose figures comply with international standards, attribute the remainder to the excess of births over deaths – the ‘natural increase’ – as people live longer.

But research by MigrationWatch UK has revealed the figure does not include children born to immigrants arriving over the last decade. When counted, the figure rises to 84 per cent.

The report criticised the ONS prediction that 60 per cent of future population growth until 2037 will be down to migration as a ‘serious understatement’.

This suggested 43 per cent of the increase would be due to immigrants arriving after 2012, and 17 per cent to any children they have. But this did not take into account the future children of migrants already here, which would make the figure ‘much higher’, the think-tank said.

Moreover, the estimate was based on net migration of 165,000 a year, while it is currently at around 245,000. MigrationWatch UK pointed out that the birth rate is 1.83 children per woman, compared with the 2.1 needed to sustain the population.

Official figures have shown that birth rates among migrants often increase when they arrive in the UK, possibly as a result of better living conditions here.

MigrationWatch UK said the birth rates meant that within 25 years any population increase would ‘be entirely due to net migration’. ONS figures to be released tomorrow will confirm that the Government is missing its target to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said: ‘This is about population growth, not about citizenship.

‘Those born in the UK to settled immigrant parents are British citizens, irrespective of their parents’ country of birth.

‘That said, it is now undeniable that the massive scale of net migration has been the main cause of our population growth and that, in the future, our population growth is likely to be almost entirely due to migration.’

He added that official ONS statistics did not make this clear.

An ONS spokesman said: ‘In accordance with the UN international standards, the ONS does not define children who are born in the UK as immigrants.

‘MigrationWatch UK has used a different definition which produces a higher total.’
