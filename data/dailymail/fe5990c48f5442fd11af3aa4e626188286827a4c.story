A New Jersey man who heads a group the represents the non-religious was floored when his application for a personalized license plate reading ‘ATHE1ST’ was rejected for being ‘offensive.

David Silverman is president of American Atheists and wanted a plate that would reflect his beliefs but was told on Monday his request was ‘Objectionable or Need Clarification.’

The state’s Motor Vehicle Commission didn’t realize who they were rejecting, though. Silverman immediately responded with an appeal and in just a couple of days New Jersey reversed their decision and he’s now set to receive the plate.

Denied: David Silverman, president of American Atheists, saw his vanity plate application rejected, but the state of New Jersey didn't know who they were dealing with. The request has since been approved

Silverman was livid and called the MVC, where he was told his request was ‘objectionable.’

‘There was absolutely no reason that this plate should be denied; this is outrageously discriminatory,’ said Silverman. ‘There is nothing offensive about atheism or atheists. The state of New Jersey had no right to deem this ‘offensive’ as though it was their place to do so.’

New Jersey has rejected many license plate requests before and as of 2012, their list of objectionable plates had 1,085 words.

The New Jersey Star-Ledger published the list and reached out to the MVP for comment.

‘The language is ever evolving,’ 
spokesman Mike Horan said. ‘Slang terms and things that might have been 
pretty innocuous years ago, now might actually have a meaning at this 
point in time.’

However, the word atheist was not on the list of banned words, nor is it slang of any kind.

Error? Silverman applied knowing similar requests have been approved before. Here he is holding a vintage atheist plate. New Jersey officials said his denial was a 'clerical error'

In fact, the state has approved a plate reading ‘ATHEIST’ before. That’s what led Silverman to request the ‘1’ instead of an ‘I.’

He posed with a picture of the vintage plate in a picture that accompanied a press release sent out by American Atheists in response to the matter.

Once he receives the plates, Silverman plans to bring one with him to American Atheists’ 2014 National Convention in Salt Lake City, where American Atheists members will be able to take pictures with it.

The group has been around since 1963 and touts itself as the 'premier organization fighting for the civil liberties of atheists and the total, absolute separation of government and religion.'

Silverman is not the first person to have a problem with their New Jersey vanity plates.

Kim Romano of Manville saw a plate that was already on her car revoked in 2010.

Though authorities initially approved the plate, which read ‘BIOCH,’ they later received a complaint and forced Romano to get new tags.

Her follow up plate read ‘WHAEVER.’
