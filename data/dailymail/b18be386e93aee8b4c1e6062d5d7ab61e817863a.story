A man suspected of a string of bank robberies in Karachi has been arrested by police wearing a novelty noose t-shirt from the Edinburgh Dungeon tourist attraction. 

The man, who is believed to have been in his 20s, was arrested with two other men in a raid by the Pakistani Special Investigations Unit. 

The men were held following a police operation in the Korangi Awami Colony on Wednesday.

Police displayed the three suspects and three weapons following a raid in Karachi earlier today 

Pakistani police tracked down the three men following a botched robbery in the Gulistan Johar area of the city last month. 

Two of the men entered the bank without wearing any disguises and were captured on CCTV.  

It is understood that the gang shot one guard who returned fire forcing them to retreat. The men stole a small sum of cash as well as a mobile phone belonging to one of the staff. 

The men escaped from the scene on motorbikes.  

During the raid, police recovered two semi-automatic handguns and a chromed pump-action shotgun. 

Police stood guard while the men and the weapons were shown to the press earlier today. The men were hooded and handcuffed to each other as the media photographed the haul. 

As well as the gift t-shirt from the Edinburgh Dungeon, the man had a sticker with the word 'extremist' attached to the garment.
