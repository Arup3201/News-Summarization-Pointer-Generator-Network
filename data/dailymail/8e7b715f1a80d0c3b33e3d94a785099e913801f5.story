If you would eat more vegetables if only peeling them was easier, help is at hand.

A £9.95 gadget can speed  up the task and reduce the  danger to fingers in using a knife or peeler.

The Karoto looks and works like an oversized pencil sharpener to peel vegetables such as courgettes and carrots or any similar-shaped vegetable such as the cucumber or parsnip.

The quirky Karoto kitchen gadget, pictured, from Israel-based design firm Monkey Business looks like a giant pencil sharpener and can peel any root vegetable including carrots and parsnips in just 30 seconds

Karoto works just like a pencil sharpener too. The user inserts the vegetable and twists it against the blade to shave off the skin. The shavings of cucumbers and courgettes can also be used to decorate salads

Its creators also claim the time-saving invention is safer than slicing the skin off vegetables compared to a standard peeler or knife.

Karoto was designed by Avichai Tadmor for Monkey Business design studio in Israel.

His team claim the Karoto can completely peel a carrot in less than 30 seconds and say that not only does it save time but the shavings can also be used to decorate salads.

The kitchen gadget is 3-inches long and 2-inches wide and can also be used to sharpen carrots, for example, for presentation purposes.

Jenni Day, sales manager at London-based Luckies - the gift site that sells the Karoto in the UK - said: 'The Karoto is a really fun, quirky gift that can make 
preparing dishes a bit more interesting.

'It makes peeling vegetables easy and 
can be used with any long root vegetables such as carrots, courgettes, 
parsnips, and cucumbers.

The Karoto not only saves time, its creators claim it is a safer alternative to peeling vegetables using 'dangerous' traditional peelers and knives

The Karoto is 3-inches long and 2-inches wide. It comes in orange and black and costs £9.95

'It comes with restrictions for 
children's use as a lot of items of cutlery and kitchen gadgets do, but 
it is definitely easier to do than other ways of peeling vegetables.

'It looks like a pencil sharpener and works in a similar way and I would say it would take about 30 seconds to peel a carrot.

'Not only does it make peeling a fast 
process but it also leaves curls which can be used to decorate salads 
and brighten up other dishes.'

The Karoto comes in orange and black and costs £9.95 plus postage.

The device is also sold by Prezzybox.

Another recent time-saving kitchen device was designed to make it faster and easier to separate egg yolks from whites.

Called Yolkr, the gadget works like a pipette by sucking the yolk cleanly into an attached plastic case before being squeezed out in one piece.

After the egg has been cracked into a 
bowl the gadget sucks up the yolk into a 
wide-mouthed plastic nozzle when the rubber top is squeezed.

It then holds the yolk safely until 
the cook is ready to use it, when with another squeeze of the top it 
plops it back out in one piece.

The Yolkr costs £18.
