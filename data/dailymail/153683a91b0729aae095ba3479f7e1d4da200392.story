An Olympic medallist has been arrested as part of a 'child kidnap gang' that plotted to steal children involved in custody battles.

Ukrainian Olympic sailing champion Larysa Moskalenko was held by police in Italy.

Officers say they have broken up an international child abduction ring that charged thousands of pounds to steal children.

Moskalenko: The Olympic champion was arrested in connection with the organisation

The Telegraph reports several people have been arrested as well as Moskalenko and they have been named as Luigi Cannistraro, Antonio Barazza and Sebastiano Calabrese.

The four were allegedly involved in a company which involved former special forces soldiers.

Armed with weapons, tasers and pepper spray, it is alleged they launched risky operations to take the children.

Children who were living with one parent following a divorce or separation were reunited with the other parent. 

Police said the organisation employed 'contractors, for the most part veterans of special corps from the armed forces, ready to offer their operational skills to whoever was willing to pay them handsomely enough'.

Bronze medallist Moskalenko scooped her award at the Seoul Olympics but in 1993 moved to Sicily, where she now runs a luxury boat rental business.

It is alleged her part in the syndicate was to hire out powerful speed boats which were used to take children from countries in North Africa and bring them to Italy, from where they were reunited with their parents in other European countries.

Moskalenko, 50, was arrested on Thursday by police in Palermo, Sicily, along with two boat captains, Barazza and Calabrese and another local man, Cannistraro.

Arrest warrants were also issued for Per Ake Helgesson, reportedly a former member of the French Foreign Legion, and Daniel Bakke, two Swedish employees of ABP World Group, a Norwegian security company with offices in Britain.

The pair have been in Tunisia for more than a year after being arrested in November last year in connection with a plot to help a Norwegian woman abduct her daughter from her estranged Tunisian husband.

The firm charged up to €250,000 (£212,000) for operations, the Italian police said.

An arrest warrant was also issued for Martin Waage, the chief executive officer of the security firm, which specialises in what it calls 'parental child abduction cases'.

Its website says: 'ABP World Group is dedicated to assisting those parents who need help in locating, rescuing and returning their abducted children home safely. We offer worldwide services regarding parental abduction,'

Mr Waage denied that any of his employees had done anything wrong, insisting that they never carried weapons and operated within the law.

The firm provided 'security and surveillance' for parents attempting to snatch back children from estranged partners, he told The Telegraph.

The alleged plot involved kidnapping children from North African countries and taking them via Sicily to the rest of Europe. One child was allegedly taken to Norway in October last year

The company had worked for clients all over the world, including on behalf of Britons locked in custody disputes with ex-wives and husbands in Africa and Asia.

'We are not a criminal organisation involved in kidnapping or trafficking,' he said.

'We are a serious company working on child recovery, operating on the right side of the law. We never use weapons – that would mean the situation was already too dangerous for the child involved. We have friends in Interpol and we cooperate with the police.'

He admitted that the firm had hired Moskalenko to provide a speedboat, which was kept on standby off the coast of Tunisia to act as back-up for the operation in Tunis.

'We never go into a country like Tunisia without having a back door (exit strategy),' Mr Waage, 42, a former paramedic and close protection officer, said. 'She is innocent - she just hired us a boat.'

But police in Italy say he and the other accused could face charges of kidnapping and human trafficking.
