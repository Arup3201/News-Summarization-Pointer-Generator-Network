House Speaker John Boehner put himself one step closer to suing the President of the United States on Thursday, unveiling a resolution permitting the move and attracting return fire from the White House.

Announcing late in the day that the legal action will focus on the Affordable Care Act, Boehner fumed that Barack Obama had 'changed the health care law without a vote of Congress' in 2013, 'effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it.'

The president, he carped, 'believes he has the power to make his own laws.'

The Obama administration has taken several actions that Republicans say twisted the plain meaning of the Obamacare law's black-letter text, ignoring dates that the law set in stone – for both practical and political reasons.

The law's employer mandate, in particular, has been pushed back twice although the law reads that it 'shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013.'

Buried: Speaker of the House John Boehner criticized President Obama's economic policies during a press conference on Thursday but announced his lawsuit plans later in the day as Washington lawyers and spokespersons started their evening commutes

Republicans 'actually plan to sue me,' Obama mocked on Thursday in Texas. 'Really? Really? For what? You¿re going to sue me for doing my job?'

The administration pushed it back by one year, burying the announcement in a blog entry. Later, the Department of Health and Human Services announced another one-year reprieve for some employers.

The mandate requires most large employers to provide health insurance to their workers or pay a financial penalty.

The Treasury Department suggested in a July 2013 memorandum that it didn't intend to delay the legal mandate – just the requirement that employers report to the IRS whether or not they had complied.

But without those reports, legal analysts have noted, there's no basis for exacting any penalties.

The Supreme Court declared in 2012 that the Affordable Care Act passed constitutional muster because the penalties amounted to a tax, a senior aide to House Republican leaders reminded MailOnline.

He said that because of that legal precedent, the House counsel is likely to argue that the Treasury Department lacks the authority to pick and choose which taxes to collect in a given year.

Publicly, however, the legal nuance is less important to Republicans than the broad-stroke declaration that President Obama has overstepped the boundaries of his constitutional box.

'No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own,' Boehner said in a statement, drawing a quick retort from the White House press office.

'It is disappointing that Speaker Boehner and congressional Republicans have decided to waste time and taxpayer dollars on a political stunt,' read a statement Press Secretary Josh Earnest fired off an hour later.

Washington doesn't get much stranger: The GOP is preparing to argue before a federal judge that the president should be forced to retract delays in his medical insurance overhaul law, even though they sought he same kinds of delays during a showdown last year that landed the federal government in partial shutdown mode.

'These guys can't take yes for an answer, I guess,' a Democratic Senate aide told MailOnline.

The 
concept of filing suit against the president has been in the works for 
months, according to the senior Republican leadership aide, but it 
gathered steam as GOP leaders began to realize that the Supreme Court 
might give their potential case a boost.

Last
 week the high court ruled that Obama overstepped his authority with 'recess' appointments of three lawyers to the National Labor 
Relations Board in 2012.

The administration argued at the time that the U.S. 
Senate wasn't in a position to consider the nominations because it was in a brief break
 from regular order.

The Supreme Court, however, ruled unanimously that the White House lacks the authority to make that determination, and it's up to the Senate to decide when it's actually in 'recess.'

The Obamacare law's centerpiece is a requirement that employers with 50 or more workers provide medical insurance or pay a fine beginning on January 1, 2014 -- but the White House has already delayed that penalty's implementation twice

Boehner erupted in anger at Obama on Thursday: 'He's been president for five and a half years -- when's he going to take responsibility for SOMETHING?'

That decision could be a lifeline for Republicans who aim to paint the Obama administration as lawless and dismissive of the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers.

Some Democrats fear a series of similar legal rulings that would leave the White House toothless during Obama's lame-duck years, and at the mercy of a coming Congress that threatens to be dominated by the GOP.

'If he files [the lawsuit], it's clearly going to be fast-tracked to the Supreme Court,' the Democratic Senate aide said Thursday, 'and given what we've seen from them lately, that can't be good.'

Boehner's resolution is widely expected to pass easily in the House of Representatives, along party lines. It would authorize him to file his lawsuit in federal court.

Once the legal complaint reaches a judge, Republicans will have to grapple with the thorny question of whether or not they have legal 'standing' to sue in the first place.

In court, 
the House of Representatives will have to show that it has suffered an 
injury – in this case, the nullification of its powers under the 
Constitution.

It may also have to show that there's no way to remedy the situation other than obtaining a court order that would hamstring Obama.

But the 
House does have the power to withhold the billions of dollars required 
to implement the Obamacare law – and the power to impeach the president.

Those options, says Elizabeth Foley, a lawyer advising Boehner on strategy, are far too radical.

The U.S. Supreme Court will llikely find itself arbitrating Boehner's lawsuit once it wends its way through lower federal courts, a situation that concerns Democrats since the justices have already unanimously ruled that Obama overstepped his authority in other cases

Obama's speech Thursady at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas was a partisan love-fest full of barbs at Republicans who, he said, are doing little more than standing in his way

'Impeachment is overkill for this particular transgression,' she told the conservative National Review on Saturday. 'All Congress wants is for the president to faithfully execute the law. This does not mean that they think he should be kicked out of office.'

Boehner has cautioned that his lawsuit shouldn't be interpreted as a prelude to impeachment proceedings, drawing howls from tea party groups and conservative lawmakers in his own caucus.

And using the power of the purse to stop all of Obamacare, Foley says, would penalize innocent people and organizations for what could amount to a petty punishment of the president.

Expecting House Republicans to find their own remedy, she says, makes sense 'only when [it's] proportionate and related to the transgression.'

Obama, traveling in Texas for a string of Democratic fundraisers, seemed to anticipate Boehner's move on Thursday during an economic speech in the liberal enclave of Austin.

'Now, here’s where it gets interesting,' Obama said, discussing his 'year of action' strategy to issue a series of executive orders in defiance of Congress.

'There are a number of Republicans, including a number in the Texas delegation, who are mad at me for taking these actions. They actually plan to sue me.'

'You hear some of them,' he said, drawing laughter and applause: “Sue him.” “Impeach him".'

'Really? Really? For what? You’re going to sue me for doing my job? Okay.'
