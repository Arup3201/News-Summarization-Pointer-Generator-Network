A moving new campaign has been launched to help ex-cons adjust to society by transforming their prison tattoos into colorful works of art.

The Freedom Tattoos project, a collaboration between the Pedagogium College of Social Sciences in Warsaw, Poland, and ad agency Isobar Poland, was created to 'transform crude, hideous amateur tattoos made in prisons and juvenile detention centers into professional, socially well-perceived artistic tattoos, that will help them find a job', according to its website.

In a YouTube video describing the project, Pedagogium Professor Konopczynski explains why prison tattoos are harder to remove than ink designs done in regular parlors.

Bad ink: The Freedom Tattoos project aims to help ex-cons adjust to society by transforming their prison tattoos into colorful works of art; one woman had the word 'vendetta' (left) turned into an artful design (right)

Mirror, mirror: The woman is seen happily checking out the results of her transformation

'Prison tattoos are made with improvised equipment assembled at the facility,' he said. 'Removing them is hard and leaves visible scars. They stigmatize and discourage potential employers.' 

The video shows two formerly incarcerated women having their tattoos camouflaged by new designs. 

One explains that she had the word 'vendetta' inked on the back of her neck at a juvenile detention center eight years ago, and was eager to have it covered for the sake of her children.

After meeting with a Freedom Tattoos artist, she is told that her prison ink can be camouflaged and transformed into a piece of art that she will be proud to show her children.  

Before: 'For twelve years, I haven't looked at my arms,' another woman says, revealing a crudely-drawn shark tattoo (pictured) she received in prison

After: She has the shark tattoo transformed into a pretty red floral pattern (pictured)

Emotional: 'Now I can discover a part of myself again. Now, I can take another step,' she says after seeing the new design 

And when she sees the beautiful floral artwork that has replaced the basic wording, she exclaims: 'Oh my God...the "vendetta" is gone!' 

A few weeks after her tattoo transformation, she adds: 'Now everything is different. And when my tattoo was healing, my son would come to me with an ointment to put on my wounds. This program gave me a great chance. A chance to start a new life.' 

The other woman, who has lived with a crudely-drawn shark tattoo for more than a decade, reveals: 'For twelve years, I haven't looked at my arms. I just don't look at myself in the mirror. It's like I don't have a part of myself.'

After her tattoo is transformed into an elaborate floral design, she is overcome with emotion. 

Fresh start: The women work with the Freedom Tattoos artists to create a meaningful design that will camouflage their prison ink

Mission statement: The project was launched to show that 'social rehabilitation is not about erasing the past, but rather building on it based on one's talents and passions'

Happy ending: 'Oh my God...the "vendetta" is gone!' the first woman exclaims when she sees her new tattoo

'Now I can discover a part of myself again,' she says. 'Now, I can take another step. And this is fantastic because I don't have to be locked up anymore in that gray world that held me back.' 

Professor Konopczynski further explains the significance of adding to the tattoos rather than eliminating them altogether.

'At Pedagogium, we teach that social rehabilitation is not about erasing the past, but rather building on it based on one's talents and passions. Sometimes the slightest change in one's life can bring the best results,' he says.

'If they decided to get tattoos, then it means that they wanted to express something. We help them express themselves better.'
