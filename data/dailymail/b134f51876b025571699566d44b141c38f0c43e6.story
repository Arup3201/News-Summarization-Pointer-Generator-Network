It has been imparting words of wisdom and advice to young girls for almost two decades.

But the editor of Britain’s longest-running pre-teen magazine has now insisted that controversial pop stars including Miley Cyrus will no longer feature in Girl Talk magazine, following concerns over their increasingly sexualised behaviour.

Despite being a regular cover star of the publication, which launched in 1995, the 21-year-old singer is now considered to be a poor role model for the 7-12 age group that the magazine caters for.

The editor of Britain's longest-running pre-teen magazine has now insisted that controversial pop stars including Miley Cyrus will no longer feature in Girl Talk magazine, following concerns over their increasingly sexualised behaviour

Instead, the publication’s bosses have launched a new campaign which will see them featuring less celebrities and more varied female role models, claiming they have a responsibility to ‘protect the development’ of young women.

Miley Cyrus first appeared on the cover of Girl Talk as 17-year-old Disney Starlet Hannah Montana.

But Bea Appleby, editor of the magazine, has now revealed that the new campaign, which has been called Girls Are Amazing, will feature more responsible role models such as Taylor Swift and Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton.

The move came in response to a readership survey carried out by Girl Talk, which revealed that eight of the top ten most-admired celebrities were all singers.

Top of the list was controversial star Katy Perry, followed by Taylor Swift and Jessie J.

The study also found that the majority of readers aspired to be a singer, dancer or actor, while a quarter of readers said that the most important way for them to be described was ‘pretty’.

Miss Appleby told the Daily Mail yesterday: ‘We have always been very careful about having stars in our magazine who are suitable - not too raunchy or controversial.

‘We haven’t had Miley Cyrus in the magazine for a long time because she is now too raunchy for us. When she was Hannah Montana we used to have her on the cover all the time. She was great for us, but she has changed and she has become much more sexualised.

‘It is a bit hard for us to reconcile what her videos are like and that we are dealing with eight year old girls. It’s hard for us to promote her and she is not suitable for this age group.

‘It is difficult to find pop stars that are suitable. Even the most innocent kinds of pop stars are still a bit sexy.’

Miss Appleby suggested that US country singer Taylor Swift was an example of a pop star who appealed to the pre-teenage readership, but who was not considered overtly sexualised.

However, she added that the fortnightly magazine, which publishes its 500th issue today, would endeavour to feature a wider range of female celebrities in its pages, including sports stars and successful businesswomen.

She added: ‘Our readers like pop stars, but we need to make sure that we balance it out and feature people who aren’t dancing around in a sexy way wearing nearly nothing.

‘The ten most admired celebrities were all singers or actors. Sportswomen, politicians and businesswomen didn’t register on the list.

‘We need to show there are lots of other interesting women out there doing interesting things, who aren’t trading on their looks and who are valued for something other than how they look.

‘We uphold certain standards where we don’t talk about anything to do with sex. We don’t talk about boys. We are very much about female friendship.’

Speaking about the magazine, Miss Appleby said delivering content for pre-teenage girls came with a lot of responsibility in preparing them for their teenage years.

‘We have always tried to protect the development of young girls, making sure that they don’t grow up too early, but our survey results have revealed that this is not enough.

‘We have a duty to show our readers different ways of being a girl and not just one narrow ideal. We want to encourage them to achieve and break away from limiting and old-fashioned beliefs about what girls can do.

The magazine editor said it will have features on sports stars, and businesswomen, and if it works we will have stars like Jessica Ennis on the cover

‘Within the magazine we will have a much broader range. We will have features on sports stars, and businesswomen, and if it works we will have stars like Jessica Ennis on the cover.’

‘If early on we can give them a sense that there are lots of things that women can do that are worthwhile other than being pretty and attractive, then hopefully that will stick with them as they get older.

‘We can give them a foundation so that when they get to their teenage years they have already started thinking about how they can be a chemical engineer.

‘I spend a lot of time taking to ten year old girls and they are very switched on. They already know about inequality between men and women and understand about the pressures that girls are under. They are bombarded constantly with images of airbrushed women. It is a very unattainable idea of beauty that we all see. They are just the same as women in what they are being fed.

‘We realised that we really have to do something to help with this. We are part of why they think that and we want to break that cycle and show them different people to look up to and show them different careers that they can aspire to.’
