Plea deal: Jared Loughner is expected to plead guilty to the 2011 shooting that left six people dead and 13 others injured

Jared Lee Loughner is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday in the 2011 shooting attack that left six people dead and 13 others, including Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, injured in Tucson, Arizona, according to  sources familiar with the case.

During the hearing, a court-appointed psychiatrist will testify that despite drastic swings in his mental capacity, Loughner, 23, is competent to enter a plea at this time as he comprehends what happened and acknowledges the gravity of the charges.

The source, speaking on condition of anonymity about upcoming events in the criminal case, said the plan is for Loughner to enter a guilty plea in the murders and attempted murders that would result in a sentence of life imprisonment.

The plan is contingent on the judge in the case allowing Loughner to enter the plea.

Loughner pleaded not guilty to 49 charges stemming from the January 8, 2011, shooting rampage outside a Tucson supermarket where Giffords was meeting with constituents.

Authorities said he shot Giffords, opened fire on the crowd and was subdued by bystanders. Giffords was struck in the head and subsequently left Congress to devote her time to rehabilitation.

An Arizona college that Loughner attended released numerous emails about him that painted a picture of a struggling student with emotional problems who disturbed others with his strange behavior.

U.S. District Judge Larry Burns had ruled that Loughner isn't psychologically fit to stand trial, but that he could eventually be made ready for trial after treatment.

Experts had concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia.

Prison officials in Missouri, where Loughner has been held, have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs to make him fit to stand trial.

Even though psychologists have said Loughner's condition is improving, his lawyers have vigorously fought the government's efforts to medicate him.

At one point, a federal appeals court halted the forced medication, but resumed it once mental health experts at the prison concluded that Loughner's condition was deteriorating further.

Loughner has demonstrated bizarre behavior since his arrest.

He was removed from a May 25, 2011, court hearing when he lowered his head to within inches of the courtroom table, then lifted his head and began a loud and angry rant.

His psychologist has said that since 
Loughner has been forcibly medicated, his condition has improved. He sat
 still and expressionless for seven hours at a hearing in September 
2011.

The terms of the plea
 deal remained vague Saturday on whether Loughner would admit guilt to 
all or some of the charges rather than face trial and face a potential 
death penalty verdict.

Innocent victims: Christina-Taylor Green, 9, right, and U.S. District Judge John M. Roll, left, were among the six people killed in the attack

Capital punishment initially was within the realm of possibility when federal prosecutors obtained a grand jury indictment against Loughner, and they announced the case as one with ‘potential death penalty charges,’ the Los Angeles Times reported.

According to the indictment, a search of Loughner’s home yielded a letter stashed in a safe in which Giffords thanked him for attending an earlier Congress On Your Corner event. Also in the safe was an envelope with handwriting that said, ‘I planned ahead’ and ‘My assassination’ and Giffords’ name, ‘along with what appears to be Loughner’s signature,’ the indictment said.

Prosecutors pointed to that as evidence that Loughner coldly calculated the attack.

But shortly after his arrest, the 23-year-old’s mental fitness to stand trial has been called into question by his defense team.

Courage: The 41-year-old has resigned her Arizona seat to concentrate on recovering from her injuries after she was shot in the head in January last year

His friends said he consumed alcohol and occasionally smoked marijuana;  while attending a local community college, he videotaped a rant in September of 2010 on the campus in which he screamed that the school was not following the U.S. Constitution.

According to the indictment, Loughner bought the Glock used in the shooting from a Tucson vendor in November of 2010 and the ammunition at a Wal-Mart store on the morning of the incident. He took a taxi to the Safeway supermarket  where Giffords was holding her constituent meeting.

Among those killed were 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green and U.S. District Judge John M. Roll, the presiding federal judge in Tucson.

While he was in jail, more details came out about Loughner’s  troubled mental state. In July 2011, a prison doctor reported that the 23-year-old was depressed and was insisting that ‘the radio was talking to him and inserting thoughts into his mind.’

Saved: Mrs Giffords, in a red jacket and with a compress pressed to her head, is rushed to hospital last year. Doctors say her swift arrival at the hospital may have saved her life

He was placed under suicide watch and often paced in circles about his cell, according to court records and pretrial testimony. He screamed and cried. He remained convinced that Giffords was dead, and became angry when told she survived.

When he was told at one point that he might face the death penalty, Loughner wept for nearly an hour. ‘I want to die,’ he said. ‘Give me the injection now. Kill me now.’

During a hearing last May, federal marshals forcibly removed Loughner from the courtroom after he began shouting  incoherently about ‘kill free’ or ‘kill shot.’ Then he yelled, ‘She died in front of me!’
