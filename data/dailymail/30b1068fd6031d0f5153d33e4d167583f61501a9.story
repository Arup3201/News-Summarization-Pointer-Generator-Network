A Los Angeles man yesterday became the first ever person with Down Syndrome to complete the New York City Marathon.

Jimmy Jenson may have finished hours after the winners but he raced into the record books when he crossed the line in Sunday's prestigious competition.

The 48-year-old who completed his first marathon in Los Angeles last Spring finished the New York race in just over eight hours, with the help of a very close friend, Jennifer Davis.

Davis and Jenson met 12 years ago through Best Buddies International, a non-profit dedicated to building friendships, employment and leadership training for people with intellectual and development disabilities.

Neither of them were runners, but Jensen suggested doing a 5km. Since then they have completed many runs together.

On Sunday, Jenson was cheered on by friends and family scattered along the route, and called his mother proudly at the end, saying 'I did it!'

Jenson has lived in a group home since the age of eight, so his special bond with Davis means the world to him.

And their running endeavors have seen him lose 69 pounds.

Ahead of the 26.2 mile race, Davis told the Best Buddies blog: 'It is such an honor to be able to assist my friend, Jimmy, on his journey and look back and realize how much he has taught me.

'Yes, I was able to help Jimmy become more active, get in the community, lose weight, and tie his shoes, but he taught me about enjoying life, dancing and singing like no one is watching, and that a hug and a hot cocoa can solve almost anything. I cant wait to see Jimmy cross the finish line in New York.'

The pair spent the week leading up to the marathon training together, and received a lot of support from the Los Angeles running community as well as disability charities who have trained with them, cooked healthy meals or offered words of encouragement.

According to Today, after successfully completing the race, Jenson stayed at the finish to cheer other runners across the line, telling them if he didn't quit, they couldn't either.

And he had one thing to say to Davis, 'Thank you,' before he gave his pal a big kiss on the cheek.
