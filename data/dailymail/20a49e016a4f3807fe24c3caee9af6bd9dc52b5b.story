Netflix tweeted a quip about corrupt law enforcement to promote their new show Peaky Blinders that has some critics reeling.

'Just because you’re law enforcement doesn't mean you’re law abiding. #PeakyBlinders,' read the tweet posted on Wednesday from Netflix's official account.

It came the same day that a grand jury opted not to indict a white NYPD officer who was accused of killing black father Eric Garner with a choke hold.

In the wake of protests against the grand jury's decision not to indict both Darren Wilson who killed Mike Brown and Daniel Pantaleo who killed Mr Garner, scores of critics expressed their disdain for the tweet.
