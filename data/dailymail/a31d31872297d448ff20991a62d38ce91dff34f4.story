Casey Williams, five, in the wheelchair her mother has to push her to school in everyday

A mother may have to withdraw her disabled daughter from school because the local council axed her free taxi transport when she received a wheelchair.

Casey Williams, five, from Preston, Lancashire, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year and was provided with free transport to take her to and from school.

But her mother Sarah Williams claims that since Casey now has a wheelchair, Lancashire County Council have said she no longer qualifies for free transport to Blessed Sacrament Catholic Primary School.

The 32-year-old used to carry Casey to school or push her in a buggy until she got too heavy - but when she fell pregnant again she could no longer lift the youngster.

And since giving birth to seven-week-old baby Kaylen, the mother-of-four finds it impossible to manage her daughter's wheelchair and a pushchair on the 0.7 mile journey.

Ms William's mother has volunteered to look after her baby grandson every morning while her daughter tackles the school run with Casey and her two older children.

But the single mother, who is appealing the ruling, said that if she loses she will have no choice but to keep the youngster off school.

She said: 'After school I have to rely on my eight-year-old pushing the baby in the pram so I can push the wheelchair.

'And that isn't fair on her - it means she can't go to any after school clubs or anything like that because I need her help.

'I can't keep relying on my mum.'

By law, councils are required to provide transport for primary school children who live more than two miles from their nearest available school.

Ms Williams said the county council allocated Casey a free taxi for the journey until the end of the school term in July while the family were waiting for a wheelchair.

But when she contacted the authorities before the start of the new academic year she was told Casey didn't meet criteria.

She said: 'If I didn't have a newborn I wouldn't be asking for help at all - but I can't push them both to school. Casey is too big now.'

Phil Huddart, Lancashire County Council's school transport manager, said: 'We don't discuss individual cases in detail because of confidentiality. These cases are often more complicated than they appear and we are still awaiting the outcome of a further appeal.

'We can offer help with school transport under certain circumstances although assessments must always focus on the needs of the individual child, not the situation of other family members.

'To qualify for transport help, children are also expected to attend the nearest suitable school to where they live.

'When an appeal is made it is a chance for both sides to look at the situation afresh and consider any alternatives which may be appropriate.'

Mr William's father Keith Williams, 56, said: 'I think it is absolutely disgusting really that we have to go through all of this to get a taxi for a child with a disability.

'We are appealing the decision at the moment but we have to wait until the beginning of October to find out whether she will be granted the free transport or not.

'But in the mean time it is a real struggle for Sarah as she has three other children and she can't push the wheelchair and the baby's pram.

'No one from the council has been out to assess Casey - they have just said she doesn't fit their criteria, but every child with cerebral palsy is different.

'It is a bad day when you have to go through all of this. The whole situation makes me really angry.'
