A teenage boy was buried by sand after a dune collapsed on top of him.

The 14-year-old was completely submerged at a beach in North Bamburgh, Northumberland, on Sunday.

The teenager's head was quickly freed so that he could breathe but the weight of the sand meant he was trapped up to his shoulders for around two hours, emergency services said.

Trapped: Emergency services scrambled to release a teenage boy buried beneath falling sand when a dune collapsed at Budle Bay in North Bamburgh

Rescue: The boy was placed on a stretcher before being airlifted to hospital after rescue workers managed to free him from the sand

He is thought to have been digging in the dune at Budle Bay when the sand began to collapse.

The boy was airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle following the dramatic rescue, and is now said to be 'fit and well'.

Northumbria Police were called to the beach at 2.15pm on Sunday. A Great North Air Ambulance Service helicopter and personnel from HM Coastguard and North East Ambulance Service also attended the scene.

Sgt Vicky Quinn, of Northumbria Police, said: 'We had a report of this child buried in the sand.

'We got a call about 2.15pm. He is out now, I am led to believe he is fit and well.'

Jim Entwistle, from the GNAAS, said: 'He must have been buried for a couple of hours.

'It was quite a long rescue. I know they managed to get his head free so he could breathe. The weight of the sand was the issue.

'We took a doctor to the scene so they could get to him as soon as he was freed.'

Earlier this year Ronnie Martin, 32, from Bedlington, was rescued after being buried in sand at Druridge Bay in Northumberland.

The plasterer had been digging a hole in the sand at the beach when a dune collapsed on top of him.

He was freed by emergency services and airlifted to hospital.

In April two schoolgirls were lucky to escape with their lives after a landslide at Norfolk's Hemsby beach.

Abigail Thomas, 12, and Jodie Leach, nine, were digging a hole at the base of a sandy cliff face when up to 30 tonnes of sand began to slide away from the top.

The pair tried to run away but when Jodie tripped and fell the girls became trapped by the falling sand.

Passersby scrambled to help free the schoolgirls from the sand until emergency services arrived on the scene.
