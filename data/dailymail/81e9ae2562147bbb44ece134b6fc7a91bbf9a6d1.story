There are few things as annoying as leaving your house in a hurry, getting into your car and preparing to drive off - only to realise that the inconsiderate parking of someone else has blocked you in.

An actor and comedian has channeled that feeling of frustration in an online video poking fun at a YouTube blogger who moaned that his car was towed away.

Joey Graceffa ranted to his two million plus YouTube subscribers about having to pay a $200 fine to retrieve his car after it was impounded because he was blocking someone's drive 'just a little bit'.

But Nate Clark's witty riposte is sure to put the young 'vlogger' in his place - or at least make sure he thinks twice about where he parks his car in future.

Riposte: Actor and comedian Nate Clark has posted a funny video on YouTube poking fun at a teen with more than two million followers on the site who ranted about having his car towed away

Rant: Joey Graceffa complained about having to pay $200 to retrieve his car to his two million YouTube followers

Clark was posting in response to two videos posted on the site by Graceffa, which show him finding that his Toyota Prius has been taken from a Los Angeles street and then complaining about the fine he had to pay to get his wheels back.

Directly addressing Joey, the comedian tells the camera that it was his driveway that the car was blocking.

Despite his friends' encouragement to post a video online mocking Graceffa's own videos, he thought that might be a little cruel. 

But he claims to have changed his mind having seen Joey's rants.

In a five point lecture, aimed at explaining why he had the car towed away and explaining that his driveway was more than 'just a little bit' blocked, Clark shows a picture of a blue Prius parked right across a driveway.

He points out to Joey, who complained in one of his videos that there were no parking restriction signs in the road where his car was towed, that he had considered putting a sign in front of his drive asking people not to park there but adds 'that would be insane'.

In response to Joey's suggestion that the owner of the driver put his 'fat a**' car' on a diet so that he could've squeezed his car out - Clark points out that his car is a Volkswagen Golf, which 'at 70.3 inches wide is one of the slimmest cars out there'.

Joey also remarked in his videos that whoever towed his car away is a 'slut'.

But Nate responds: 'That's just not true man, I wasn't trying to move my car so I could meet up with some sexual rendezvous, I just wanted to move my car because that's my right.'

And finally, Clark warns Joey not to leave his Federal Tax Return on the passenger seat of his car, joking about how much he earned from YouTube in 2012 and how much he owes the taxman.

He ends his video with the warning: 'Next time you park in front of a driveway, you might want to apologise to them in your YouTube video because it's probably 100 per cent your fault.'

Despite Clark's claims that he had the car towed away, it's fair to say that there's every chance that the video is tongue-in-cheek.

But even if the video is just a joke, that didn't stop some of Joey's more outspoken followers hitting back at Clark.

One YouTube user commented: 'This annoying p**** has been waiting for an opportunity like this to grab views/subscribers.

'Joeys car was the best﻿ thing that happened to him - just look at the glee on his face! He's not worried about any of the points he's making; it's all look at me! Look at me!'
