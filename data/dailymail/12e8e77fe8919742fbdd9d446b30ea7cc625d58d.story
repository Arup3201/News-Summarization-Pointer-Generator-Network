Celebrities adorned their most ostentatious festive knitwear to mark Christmas jumper day. 

From Made In Chelsea cast members to the Arsenal footballers preparing for their match against Newcastle United, celebrities got in the seasonal spirit with garish reindeer, snowmen and Santa sweaters.

In the same vein as Movember, the now annual fundraising event is in its third year and has seen the once shunned festive jumper (famously derided in the film 'Love Actually') make a popular return to the high street stores.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg showed his support for the Save the Children campaign and wrote on his Twitter that he is 'hoping to win the office's most garish Christmas jumper competition. What do you think?'

At 10 Downing Street, Samantha Cameron donned seasonal knitwear as she joined more than 40 schoolchildren from across the country who exchanged Christmas jumpers.

Mrs Cameron, 43, sported a light blue sweater featuring falling snow and two robins which was made by Asda's George, the charity's partner.

Never one to miss out on the latest trend, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg posted a picture on Twitter with a cosy Christmas sweater - complete with down-to-earth mug of tea - with the caption: 'Hoping to win the office's most garish Christmas jumper competition. What do you think?' 

Mr Clegg's picture in his jumper follows the release of his family Christmas cards, which featured a series of toe-curling poses in a festive photo-booth with wife Miriam.

Pets also got in on the act, wearing Santa costumes, jumpers and elf hats on the Christmas jumper day

And it wasn't just politicians who were getting in on the action, as pets across Britain were also snapped wearing their finest festive garments. 

Cats, dogs, rabbits and even hedgehogs were pictured everything from Christmas ties, to Santa costumes and mistletoe hats.

All money raised from Christmas Jumper Day will go towards vulnerable children via the Save the Children charity, both in the UK and abroad.
