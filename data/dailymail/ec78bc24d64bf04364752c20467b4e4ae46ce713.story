Savings have fallen to a record low as thousands of families fail to put away any money at the end of each month, figures show

Savings have fallen to a record low as thousands of families fail to put away any money at the end of each month, figures show.

High house prices and poor wage growth has led to a dramatic fall in the amount that families are saving into pensions, bank accounts and investments.

Growing confidence in the economy has also deterred people from savings because they believe their job is secure and their home will grow in value.

But experts warned that Britain faced a 'savings crisis' and said many would be left in pension poverty.

This year, total households will save just 5.4 per cent of their take-home pay – the lowest percentage since records began 18 years ago.

This is just half of the proportion saved in 2010 when households put away 11 per cent of their salary after tax, official figures show.

By 2019, this will have plunged further to 4.8 per cent, according to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

The International Longevity Centre (ILC), which analysed the data, said Britain was in the middle of 'a lost decade' of savings, which would not end until at least 2020.

In 2010, mass redundancies saw savings hit a 12-year high as people squirrelled away their money amid fears they could lose their job.

But since then, savings have fallen sharply as people increased their level of credit card debt and taken on larger mortgages.

House prices have soared by double digits in many parts of the country, meaning many have large home loans, while below-inflation pay rises have compounded the problem.

Experts said last night that such poor savings risked leaving many with an inadequate income in retirement.

Ben Franklin, at the ILC, told the Mail: 'People are spending more, rent and house prices have risen, but wages have stagnated.

'We have had a consumption-driven recovery, with people buying more, but without the pay rises accompanying that.

'This means many are struggling to put something away at the end of the month, so they are saving less money into their pension or bank accounts.'

Figures show that, on average, employees contributed just 2.9 per cent of their salary into a money purchase pension every month, while those in a gold-plated final salary pensions pay 5.9 per cent.

'For many, this is not enough for an adequate retirement income', Mr Franklin added.

'We have a lost decade of savings which could turn into two or three decades.

'If people do not start saving more, there will be a generation of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are significantly worse off in retirement than their parents.'

Anna Bowes, of rate tracker website Savings Champion, said workers were deterred from saving by record low interest rates.

She said: 'People are looking at the rock-bottom rates and thinking it is not worthwhile to save.'

She said there had been a shift away from saving in recent decades, adding: 'For many older generations, there was a savings culture and they were not as keen to get into debt.

'Now, people are in a lot of debt from a young age if they go to university, so they do not get into a habit of saving until much later.

'The fall in savings is a ticking time bomb.

'If people do not save now then what will they do when they reach retirement?'.

Auto-enrolment has seen millions of workers automatically entered into a workplace pension in the last three years. In 2012, the Government introduced new rules which forced bosses to pay into a pension for their employees.

Steve Webb said that auto-enrolment had helped to reverse a long-term decline in the number of people saving into a pension.

He said: 'If you leave it to people [to save themselves] then it isn't go to happen, and that is the point of auto-enrolment.'

But he said the drop in savings also symbolised increased confidence in the economy, saying: 'After the 2008 financial crash, people became quite risk adverse and savings went up quite dramatically.

'Now people feel more comfortable and, while they may be saving less, they might be looking at the rising value of their house as an asset.'
