A nine-month-old boy who appeared in Pakistan charged with attempting to murder police officers has been cleared, following a week-long police investigation.

Baby Muhammad Mosa Khan was accused of being part of a ruthless gang of gas thieves who tried to kill police by hurling stones at them during a raid.

Last week he was pictured at court in Lahore sitting on his grandfather's lap, contentedly sucking on a bottle of milk as the charges against him were read out.

A Pakistani lawyer said the judge announced the decision after Saturday's court hearing during which police said it had dropped the charge against the boy.

He said police had registered the case against the toddler and his family members without investigating the matter and the judge had sought an explanation.

The case highlights the country's dysfunctional criminal justice system where even children are not immune from questionable legal decisions.

The toddler was hauled before the court last Friday as part of an investigation relating to an incident where residents in his neighborhood clashed with police.

A police report alleged the suspects tried to murder officers by throwing stones at them during the raid.

The report lodged a complaint against Muhammad Yassen's whole family, which included his nine-month-old grandson.

Sub-Inspector Kashif Ahmed was reportedly suspended for registering the case against the child.

The child's father said the group had been protesting against a shortage of electricity in their area, The Times of India reported.

Punjab's Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif meanwhile intervened to ordered a report from the police's Inspector General.

He also reportedly demanded 'stern action' against the officials responsible for bringing the case, according to The Nation.

The Minister for Human Rights and Minorities Affairs Khalil Tahir Sindhu is also said to have taken notice of the case.
