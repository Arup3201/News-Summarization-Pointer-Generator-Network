This is Australia's biggest single leaf and it's so large it can even support the weight of a small adult.

The giant Amazon water lily, which spans almost two metres, was grown in a nursery at Yarra Junction, north-east of Melbourne.

Geoff Cochrane, the owner of Blue Lotus Water Garden, is the man behind  the giant leaf and admits he  was 'chuffed' to find out his lily was the biggest in the country.

Geoff Cochrane, the owner of Blue Lotus Water Garden in Melbourne, has grown a giant water lily that spans almost two metres in width

'The biggest ever grown in Adelaide was 1.65 metres, so we've just exceeded that, which we're quite chuffed about,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's a six month process to get them up to that size. This is largest we've gotten to grow them because I'm feeding them more heavily.'

The leaf Mr Cochrane has grown has reached 1.7 metres. It's so big his two grandchildren can even sit on top of the giant lily in water without sinking.

The leaf is so big it can even hold Mr Cochrane's five-year-old granddaughter Kimberely without sinking

The biggest ever grown in Adelaide was 1.65 metres, but Mr Cochrane's measures 1.7 metres

Mr Cochrane said it's a six month process to get the giant leaves up to that size

He said it all starts from a seed the size of a pea.

'The seed is sown in August and it forms a seedling by September. They're then planted in the heated pond and then by Christmas they are that large,' he said. 

'It's remarkable that small pea eventually turns into that gigantic lily.' 

He feeds the leaf a third of a bucket of fertiliser every three weeks. 

'They feed like crazy,' Mr Cochrane said. 'They have a big structure underneath, they can support quite a weight... about 50kg.
