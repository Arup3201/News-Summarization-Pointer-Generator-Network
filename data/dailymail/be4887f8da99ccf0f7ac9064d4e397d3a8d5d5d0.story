Convicted pedophile and former Queensland Labor leader Keith Wright has died in Vietnam.

Wright became head of the party in the early 1980s and came within 3000 votes of toppling Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in 1983.

He transferred to federal politics in 1984 as the Labor MP for Capricornia.

However, the former Rockhampton teacher and Baptist preacher's career came to a halt when he was jailed in 1993 for nine years, for raping and indecently dealing with two young girls.

Wright was released on home detention in early 1999 and later granted parole.

He moved with his new wife to Asia, where he has worked in literacy programs, which he felt was his opportunity to 'contribute to society' in the wake of his indiscretions. 

He emphasised that he did not work with children in his new role. 

In 2009, he publicly apologised to his two young victims, telling The Courier-Mail: 'I profoundly regret it all. I am so sorry.'

'Yes, I really blew it man,' Wright said. 'I was so stupid.'

Wright apologised for his actions in 2009, saying 'I regret it for the girls, I regret it for my family, I regret it for myself and I regret it for those in the community who looked up to me'

'I regret it for the girls, I regret it for my family, I regret it for myself and I regret it for those in the community who looked up to me.' 

He was 72 when he died.

Queensland Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk has expressed her condolences to Wright's family.

Former Labor minister Robert Schwarten described Keith Wright as a 'flawed but a tireless worker'.
