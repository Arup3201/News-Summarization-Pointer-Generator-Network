The NHS has been forced to ask British doctors in Australia to come home due to a major shortfall in numbers.

Around 1,000 more GPs are urgently needed in England, according to new figures released by the House of Commons library. 

It is thought that nearly 1,500 doctors - who cost the taxpayer up to £610,000 to train - move to Australia every year.  

To bridge the gap they have been offered a place on a 'fully funded' programme, which they can choose to be either full or part time, if they return.

An advert was placed in the Australian Doctor and the Medical Observer by NHS England's Shropshire and Staffordshire area team and Health Education Midlands earlier this month.

It said: 'This scheme will help you rediscover and enhance the skills you need to return, or start to practise in the UK.

'It's fully funded, so you will be supported whilst you complete the programme.'  

The NHS has simultaneously announced a £10million strategy to further tempt graduates and experienced medical staff.

Under a quarter of trainees chose to go into general practice last year - with just over 5,000 applicants in total. 

But cash will now be offered if they work in an under-staffed area for three years.

Andy Burnham, shadow minister for health, said the figures prove the NHS is suffering from a GP recruitment crisis.

'GP services have gone into freefall under this government. David Cameron promised to put GPs at the heart of the NHS, but instead caused a new GP recruitment crisis,' he told the Observer. 

But GP leaders have said that the advertisements will not  solve the staffing crisis.

Dr Ken Deacon, medical director of the North Midlands at NHS England, said that the problem was newly qualified GPs being outnumbered by those nearing retirement.

The advert promised doctors currently working in Australia (Sydney Opera House above) that the scheme would 'help you rediscover and enhance the skills you need to return'

A female-heavy workforce has also been blamed for the gap.

The 'feminisation' of surgeries has led to the UK needing more trainees because women are more likely to work shorter hours than men, a report released by the Migration Advisory Committee last week claimed.

This has contributed to an annual shortage of 450 to 550 GPs, the committee warned.

It suggested that more needed to be done to recruit family doctors - including hiring extra foreign doctors from across the EU.

A spokesperson for NHS England said that the central team had not previously been aware of the advertisement, but described it as a ‘positive scheme’.
