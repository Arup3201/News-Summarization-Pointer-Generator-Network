A carer has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 73-year-old man was found dead at a nursing home for dementia sufferers.

The woman, 63, was detained by detectives investigating the patient's death at the Ascot Nursing Home in Berkshire after police were called on Thursday.

The suspect, from nearby Bracknell, was then taken in for questioning on suspicion of murder but released on conditional police bail later on Friday.

Sources said that it was believed she worked at the leafy Ascot Nursing Home which caters for up to 75 patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Care for individuals costs up to Â£1,300 a week.

The care home, set in its own well-tended grounds and very close to Ascot racecourse, is privately run and has mostly single ground floor rooms which patients are encouraged to decorate with their own ornaments and belongings.

Although secure with alarms on all outer doors, there are numerous secluded areas in the grounds where patients can sit and read or enjoy the sunshine.

The police spokesman said although the man died on Saturday, March 22, police were not called to the nursing home until last Thursday.

A post mortem examination was due to be carried out at a hospital mortuary tomorrow afternoon.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Officers have attended the nursing home since Thursday as part of the investigation.

'The deceased man is not expected to be identified until Monday evening. We will not discuss the employment of the woman arrested or give any other details at present.

'All I can say is that a 63-year-old woman from Bracknell was arrested on suspicion of murder at the nursing home and that she has been released on bail pending further inquiries.'

The Care Quality Commission, which oversees private nursing homes, confirmed on its website that it was investigating the Ascot Nursing Home.

It said: 'We have received information that has led us to carry out an inspection of Ascot Nursing Home. We will publish a report when our check is complete.'

The commission did not indicate whether the 'information' related to the murder inquiry. No-one from the care home's management team was available to comment today.

A nurse who answered the door at the Ascot Nursing Home said that staff knew very little about the death or police investigation.

'We don't know anything,' said the nurse. 'We are just coming to work as normal. There is no one from management here today.'

Asked if the 63-year-old woman arrested and bailed on suspicion of murder would be coming back to work, she said: 'I don't know.

'There are confidentiality issues involved. I don't know what is going on. We only know what the management has told us.'
