Thousands of mourners today gathered to say farewell to the three young students gunned down near the University of North Carolina.

Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his new wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were allegedly shot execution-style by a neighbor at the couple's apartment in Chapel Hill on Tuesday afternoon.

On Thursday, mourners embraced each other as they gathered on athletic fields across from the Islamic Association of Raleigh, one of the city's largest mosques. Funeral services had been planned at the mosque, where the families have been longtime members, but were moved to the fields after crowds of 5,000 were expected.

The fields are owned by North Carolina State University, from where two of the victims had graduated and one was a student.

Friends and family paid tribute to the trio at a candle-lit vigil on Wednesday, and earlier on Thursday, relatives viewed the victims' bodies in a small building apart from the mosque.

The service began after midday Muslim prayers. A man facing east sang an opening prayer.

Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of Yusor and Razan, walked to the field with Deah's sobbing father, Namee Barakat, before delivering the funeral prayer. As Dr Abu-Salha addressed the crowd, he asked for a federal investigation into the shooting.

'I call upon the President of the United States, Barack Obama... please involve the FBI. Please investigate,' he pleaded. 'This has hate crime written all over it.'

He went on: 'We're not sad. We have peace inside. We are not seeking petty revenge. Our children are much more valuable than any revenge. We care about acknowledging this the way it is.'

At the service's conclusion, about a dozen people carried each of the three caskets away to hearses, which headed to the Islamic Association of Raleigh's Muslim cemetery in Wendell, where they will be buried.

Police rushed to the condos in Chapel Hill on Tuesday afternoon after neighbors called 911 to report the sounds of gunshots followed by screams and more gunshots - then silence. 

A few hours later, 46-year-old Craig Hicks - a married paralegal student and a former car parts salesman - turned himself in to authorities.  

He has now been transferred from a county jail in Durham, to the state prison in Raleigh because of security concerns, prison authorities said. He is being held without bail.

The killings are fueling outrage among people who blame anti-Muslim rhetoric for hate crimes.

Hicks made regular posts on social media slamming religion and its followers, and referring to himself as an 'anti-theist'. On Wednesday, neighbors said he always seemed angry and confrontational, while his ex-wife said he showed 'no compassion at all' for other people. 

But his wife Karen Hicks insisted that the deaths came after a long-standing parking dispute and said he often championed equality for others.

The women's father, Mohammad Abu-Salha, said police told him each was shot in the head in the couple's apartment and that he's convinced it was a hate crime.

'The media here bombards the American citizen with Islamic, Islamic, Islamic terrorism and makes people here scared of us and hate us and want us out. So if somebody has any conflict with you, and they already hate you, you get a bullet in the head,' said Abu-Salha, a psychiatrist.

A Muslim advocacy organization also pressed authorities to investigate possible religious bias. Many posted social media updates with the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter.

'We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case,' Chapel Hill police Chief Chris Blue said in an email.

Chapel Hill Police asked the FBI for help in their probe, and Ripley Rand, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, said his office was monitoring the investigation.

Police said that the young couple's neighbor Craig Hicks, a self-proclaimed 'anti-theist', carried out the killings after a long-standing parking dispute but the victims' families believe it was a hate crime.
