Welfare agencies were accused last night of failing two young boys murdered by their mother after it emerged they were returned to her care despite her attempting suicide just weeks ago.

Katherine Hooper, 24, was described by police as ‘high risk’ after she took an overdose following a furious row with the father of her children, who faces charges of assaulting her.

Her sons Joshua, five, and Sam, two, were taken into care while she was monitored in hospital but they were sent back home to the ‘vulnerable and lost’ single mother when she was released two weeks later, friends said.

On Friday, she allegedly smothered the younger boy in his bed at their terrace home in Paignton, Devon, before taking his brother to a 100ft cliff on Dartmoor, putting him on her shoulders and leaping off in front of horrified day-trippers

As friends left toys and flowers outside the family’s house, those closest to Miss Hooper said authorities must be held responsible for failing to prevent the tragedy.

Janette Nolan, 53, a friend who lives nearby, said: ‘Social services should have been protecting her.‘She was lovely, innocent, caring and kind but seemed vulnerable and lost. I think she was frightened of her future as a single mother.’ 

Miss Hooper, whose mother died of cancer last year, was awaiting the trial next month of her estranged partner of seven years, 52-year-old Neil Patterson.

He is accused of attacking her on April 28 at their home.

Shortly afterwards she took an overdose of pills before running away.

Police launched a helicopter search and public appeal to find her, describing her as a ‘high-risk vulnerable person’, and she was discovered 24 hours later face down in a field suffering from hypothermia.

Mr Patterson was subsequently served with a restraining order.

Friends suggested Miss Hooper had no control over the family’s finances and was so desperately poor after losing a job as a chambermaid she offered her cat Leon to a neighbour because she could not afford to look after it.

Last night Miss Hooper’s brother Timothy, 31, said: ‘Katherine was a loving mum.

‘We know nothing. That’s probably the hardest part to come to terms with, trying to understand as a family what’s happened.’

Detectives confirmed the family had been known to various welfare agencies and that a serious case review would be started.

Miss Hooper had been subject to an ‘intervention’ from the council, NHS and police because of her status as a vulnerable person.
