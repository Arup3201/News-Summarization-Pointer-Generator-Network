A takeaway boss who gave nine people E-coli by deep frying cooking utensils instead of cleaning them has been jailed today.

All nine people had to be treated in hospital after the outbreak of E-coli in August 2011 which was traced back to Diar Wali Ali's 'dirty' Cardiff kebab shop.

Newport Crown Court heard that staff at the Adonis Kebab House, in Roath, also washed their hands in the same sink that food was being prepared in.

Jailed: Diar Wali Ali owner of the Adonis Kebab Shop in Roath, Cardiff, has been jailed for eight months after admitting breaching 23 food hygiene laws

Health hazard: Uncooked meat was stored with burger buns and salad at the Adonis Kebab Shop

Raw meat was also stored with burger buns and salad.

Iraqi-born Ali, 38, failed to follow basic food safety standards, said prosecutors.

Prosecutor Carl Harrison said: 'Investigators found raw skewers of kebab meat and raw burgers were uncovered and stored next to burger buns and salad items.

'A dirty towel used to remove the meat from the skewer would have also touched raw meat.'

Unsanitary: Cardiff Council closed the Adonis Kebab House for two weeks following the E-coli outbreak in August 2011

In total, Ali admitted 23 food hygiene offences and was jailed for eight months.

Judge Phillip Richards told him: 'These heinous offences can be punished by nothing less than a custodial sentence.

'I hope this sets an example for other takeaway owners.

'If just one shop keeper put his house in order as a result of learning what has happened to you it will be a benefit to the public.'

The takeaway was closed by Cardiff Council for two weeks following the outbreak until inspectors were satisfied that all health risks had been removed.
