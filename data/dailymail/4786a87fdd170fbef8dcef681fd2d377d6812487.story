President Obama has reached out to several high-profile members of the Republican party and will meet for dinner with GOP senators Wednesday night after facing weeks of partisan gridlock.

The gesture acts as a political olive branch, signalling the president’s willingness for bipartisanship.

Tonight’s dinner – if it is not canceled by the impending snow storm – will include Sens. John McCain, Kelly Ayotte, Pat Toomey, and Lindsey Graham, who put together the guest list.

The dinner will be held at The Jefferson Hotel near the White House and will be followed up by Obama making a rare trip to Capitol Hill.

Obama's Republican outreach follows Washington's failure to reach a deal to avert the so-called sequester, the $85 billion in automatic budget cuts that started going into effect last Friday.

Noticeably, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner were left out of tonight’s dinner, and did not make the list of Republican lawmakers the president called over the weekend, according to the Associated Press.

Sources told the New York Times that Obama’s invitation was extended to around a dozen rank-and-file GOP lawmakers, most of them senators.

The sources revealed that the president hopes to reach agreements over several large issues like gun control and climate change which have so far defined his second term.

In trying to charm the GOP rather than pressuring lawmakers, the administration is demonstrating a shift in strategy based more on bipartisanship. 

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the president requested a meeting next week through his chief of staff. McConnell's office said the president last attended the Senate GOP's policy lunch in May 2010.

'We have numerous challenges facing the country and Republicans have offered the president serious solutions to shrink Washington spending and grow the economy,' McConnell said.

'And we will have an opportunity to discuss them with the president at the lunch.'

House Speaker Boehner's office said Wednesday that the president had also requested the meeting next week with House Republicans.

The White House and Boehner's office were working to schedule that meeting, the speaker's office said.

Among those who received calls from the president were Oklahoma Sen.Tom Coburn and South Carolina's Graham.

'This is how you solve hard problems,' Graham told the Associated Press. 'We're talking about following up on that, how we can get more people in the mix, so what I see from the president is incredibly encouraging.'

White House aides say the president's calls with Republicans focus in part on jumpstarting broader budget talks, but also on Obama's proposals for overhauling the nation's immigration laws and enacting stricter gun control measures.

'He is reaching out and talking to members about a variety of issues - not just our fiscal challenges, but certainly the fiscal issues are among the issues he is talking about with lawmakers,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
