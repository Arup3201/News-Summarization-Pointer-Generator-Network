We were feeling woozy by the time Madame Stella started pouring her 2004 vintage, but at the end of the dimly lit tasting room, the children were as bright as buttons.

William, our four-year-old, proudly announced that he could taste a hint of fresh strawberry. Megan, aged two, declared that she'd identified the tang of chocolate.

My wife Katie and I, sniffed and slurped, and tried not to hiccup too loudly when Stella asked if 'ze beautiful smooth finish' of her decade-old claret was 'agreeable'.

Wine tasting, family style: With a few glasses of grape juice, everyone can detect 'notes of chocolate'

It was mid-afternoon at Chateau Bardins, a small winery roughly half an hour's drive from the city of Bordeaux, and we'd reached the stage in every wine-tasting session when fugginess descends.

The children had been over-indulging, too. But before anyone calls social services, read on: for while we'd been quaffing fine plonk, they'd enjoyed nothing more intoxicating than a few glasses of alcohol-free grape juice, and some macaroons.

These were among the many local delicacies on offer during the Chateau's 'family gastronomic excursion', a guided tour for adults and children, of the local cuisine. 

This corner of south-western France is gastronomic mecca - but my two free-spirited children's idea of refinement is baked beans, chips and a good food fight. 

Luxurious: The Grand Hotel de Bordeaux decided to start catering for the family market a few years ago

Transformation: A floor of the palatial, 18th-century building has been largely given over to 'family suites'

Treat: Children will be thrilled to discover gift bags containing toys, teddy bears, colouring books, stickers, and sweets in their rooms

Luckily, the Grand Hotel de Bordeaux, a luxurious, 130-room landmark decided to start catering for the family market a few years ago.

While it retains all the uniformed flunkies and marble hallways of a five-star establishment, a floor of the palatial, 18th-century building has been largely given over to 'family suites', where there is no tut-tutting at inky-fingered young guests or their parents.

The fun began at check-in, where William and Megan met the hotel's 'children's concierge', a charming young man who specialises in everything from babysitters and bottle warmers to child-friendly day-trips (we made use of all three).

Then they were thrilled to discover gift bags, with their names on, containing toys, teddy bears, colouring books, stickers, and sweets. In the bathroom were toddler-sized dressing gowns, and cute slippers.

An escape zone among the vineyards: The small winery of Chateau Bardins sits just outside Bordeaux

After a hearty lunch, we set off on a guided walking tour of Bordeaux. William and Megan were thrilled by the fearsome gargoyles that inhabit its limestone buildings.

The highly prized wine has also made Bordeaux one of France's wealthiest and most glamorous, cities. Its historic centre, filled with mansions and grand public buildings, sits on the Garonne river, from where local products are shipped across the world.

Once-grimy buildings are now whitewashed so they have the warm, hue of mature brie. Squares are filled with public art and fairground carousels.

A new tramway has been laid, parks contain smart adventure playgrounds (where we spent many happy hours), and the streets are filled with boutiques, buskers, bars and wine shops.

A city of charm and elegance: With Saint Andre cathedral at its heart, Bordeaux looks great on camera

But William and Megan's favourite was the famous mirroir de l'eau, a sort of vast civic paddling pool, where they'd have gladly splashed around all weekend.

We spent our final afternoon in the rural seclusion of Chateau Bardins - mainly in the tasting room. We drank, the children ate. We made tasting notes; they tried to identify the flavour of each snack from picture cards. No food was thrown.

As Madame Stella put it, France's food capital had successfully turned two more young philistines into petits gastronomes.
