Alexis Sanchez may now be able to call himself a £30million Premier League footballer but he has not always led such a gilded life.

Arsenal's new forward grew up in poverty-stricken rural Chile in a mining town called Tocopilla - which literally means Devil's Corner - and he used to perform on the street for money at the tender age of six.

Yet now the 25-year-old is on a £130,000-a-week contract with Arsenal and will relocate to London from Barcelona with his girlfriend Laia Grassi.

Things are looking up: Alexis Sanchez signed for Arsenal from Barcelona for £30million this summer

Humble beginnings: Sanchez grew up in the poverty-stricken rural Chilean mining town of Tocopilla

Talented: When he was young Sanchez was nicknamed 'El Nino Marvailla' - meaning 'the Wonder Kid' 

Determined: Sanchez's brother Humberto said he had three options - to be a miner, fisherman or footballer

In an interview with The Sun on Sunday, Sanchez's brother Humberto revealed the Chilean international's journey from his impoverished upbringing and earning a living on the streets at the age of six to global football superstar. 

Humberto said: 'Alexis had nothing when growing up. He had to fight for everything he has.

'We were the poorest of the poor so Alexis had to earn money any way he could from a very young age.

'He would wash cars for a few pence or perform somersaults for a handful of coins from onlookers. He was like a little gymnast, hurling himself all over the place.

'The neighbours would give him a few coins for entertaining them. Sometimes he was so hungry he would knock on neighbours' doors and ask for bread. They would always gibe him what they had to spare. On occasions Alexis would box in the street for entertainment.'

Sanchez grew up in a single-storey house - which was roughly held together by wood, breeze blocks and corrogated iron - with his sisters Tamara, now 17, Marjorie, 32, and brother Humberto.

Pulling up: Sanchez's mother used to wash fish and sell flowers in order to feed her four children 

Their mother Martina raised her four children by herself after his father Gullermo Soto deserted them when Sanchez was a toddler. She did every odd-job going to bring in money for her children, including washing fish for her neighbours and selling flowers.

His daily release from the hardships of poverty was to play football barefoot on mud-covered streets - thankfully something he excelled at. 

Humberto, 28, continued: 'His poor background is what makes him so hungry to succeed on the pitch. He knows how lucky he is to be where he is and never forgets where he comes from.

'If Alexis wasn't a footballer he would be working in the mines like most men around here. It's a very tough life for 300,000 pesos (£314) a month. Growing up around here Alexis had three options - mining, fishing or football.' 

Sanchez had boundless energy as a child and was originally nicknamed 'the Squirrel' by his friends before he became known as 'El Nino Maravilla' - 'the Wonder Kid' - due to his unique footballing talents.

Money: Sanchez will earn £130,000-a-week at Arsenal but he used to scrape around for pennies on the streets

He was first spotted by Club Arauco youth team coach Alberto Toledo who brought him to the club even though he could not pay the fees. The forward once arrived late for a match and, with the team trailing 1-0, he came on and banged in eight goals.

Sanchez's journey continued as he moved to Cobreloa in Chile, then Argentina's River Plate, and Udinese in Italy's Serie A before joining Barcelona in 2011.

Last Christmas he went back to his home town with his brother and Tocopilla's mayor Fernando San Roman to give out sweets and replica shirts to poor children. He also donated £160,000 to help restore five small youth football pitches around where he used to live. 

When he was young Sanchez played football on dirty streets. This season he will grace the pitches of Old Trafford, Anfield and, most importantly, the Emirates.

Now that is quite a journey.
