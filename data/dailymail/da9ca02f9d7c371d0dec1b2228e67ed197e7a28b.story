Pop star Sting’s estate in Tuscany was renovated by workers linked to the mafia, Italian police said yesterday.

Police arrested six people on Wednesday, in connection with renovation companies that carried out high-profile work in Tuscany, including the restoration of the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence and Sting’s 900-acre estate in the Chianti hills.

Part of the firms’ profits went straight to the Neapolitan mafia, it is alleged.

The singer and his wife Trudie Styler  opened the estate to the public last year after renovation works were completed

Sting's 16th-century mansion, Il Palagio, features six cottages, a swimming pool, an outdoor chess board and a wine cellar.

The estate produces its own wine, olive oil and honey.

There is no suggestion the singer was aware of any alleged criminal action

The singer opened the estate to the public last year after renovation works were completed. Cottages can be rented for £5,800 a week each.

The construction companies, Ggf 
Construction and Pdp Construction, along with another company evaded 
taxes for €10m (£8.3m) by filing fake invoices, to artificially inflate 
their costs and lower their taxable income, police say.

The
 fabricated invoices were provided by eight other companies, closely 
associated with the Camorra mafia.

Investigators called them ‘paper 
mills’ because their sole task was printing the invoices.

‘(They) could offer such (low) prices that honest companies could not compete, enabling them to obtain important public and private works,’ police said.

There is no suggestion that Sting or any of the companies’ clients were aware of any illicit activity. 

As part of the operation, police also seized assets worth £9million.
