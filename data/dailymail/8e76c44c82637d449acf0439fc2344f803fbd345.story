Each summer Manchester City’s football hierarchy sit down to map out transfer targets for the following 12 months. Back in August, the name of Wilfried Bony was not on the list.

That less than five months later the Barclays Premier League champions are now on the verge of signing the Swansea City centre forward says much about how the ebb and flow of a football season can change things but also the enduring financial might of the world’s richest club.

It is understood the decision by football director Txiki Begiristain and manager Manuel Pellegrini to pursue Bony was taken just 10 days ago and has been driven less by injury concerns over marquee centre forward Sergio Aguero and more by a growing feeling that third-choice striker Stevan Jovetic may be sold this month.

Nevertheless, a mid-season commitment to a £30million outlay on a player who will be away at the Africa Cup of Nations for the rest of this month is remarkable and points once again to just how powerful City can be in the market when they feel the need. One of City’s most prominent objectives in recent times has been to ease themselves away from the image of a club prepared to throw money at everything, that of an organisation hard-pressed to get their heads round what is value for money and what isn’t.

Failing UEFA’s financial fair play test last year didn’t help but City’s £200m investment in a new training ground was supposed to help the club draw a line in the sand. This, they told us, is where many of City’s future first-team players will originate.

City mean this, too. The club’s owners knew their early habit of cherry-picking players from across the world - often at over-the-odds prices - had a limited shelf life and have actively moved away from such scattergun spending.

Nevertheless, City’s plans to grow ‘organically’ in the future have been put into realistic context by issues surrounding Frank Lampard and now Bony in the past week. Pellegrini’s desire for Lampard to stay at City longer than was first intended was as clear as it was understandable.

The club’s decision to then pull the rug from under the feet of its feeder club New York City FC was therefore something of a no-brainer. To work against the wishes of a coach trying to retain a league title under enormous pressure from Chelsea would have been self-defeating.

City, though, will be picking up the pieces of that decision in America for some time to come. The club have spent millions attempting to win friends - and customers - on the other side of the Atlantic, and the Lampard fiasco may well have swept away that goodwill in a single stroke.

Yet City clearly felt it was a price worth paying and their attitude reminds their rivals at home and in Europe that the single most important component of their business is winning football matches in England and the Champions League.

Certainly, Bony will help. Strong, powerful and muscular, the Ivory Coast international is similar to Aguero in style and - if he signs - will provide Pellegrini with a like-for-like replacement for the South American when he is missing and a rather impressive partner when Pellegrini decides to play them both.

Pellegrini’s current second-string striker Edin Dzeko has his qualities but a consistent goalscorer he is not. By signing Bony, City will bring depth to their striking options that even Chelsea would envy. For all Diego Costa’s excellence so far this season, Chelsea look short when the Spaniard does not play.

City, on the other hand, have managed to close the gap on Jose Mourinho’s team in the weeks that Aguero has been injured and if February begins with the Argentinian lining up alongside a new partner, then perhaps the holders may begin to look upon themselves as title favourites for the first time since the season started.

On Wednesday, Aguero was back at Manchester’s Bridgewater Hospital for a check-up on his knee; he may well be on the bench for the game against Everton this weekend, while Dzeko is set to return after calf trouble.

With Bony in the ranks, City will have to lose one player from a Champions League roster restricted by UEFA to 21 as punishment for breaching FFP guidelines. That player may well be Jovetic, who is attracting offers the club may well find hard to resist in the current transfer window.

UEFA’s punishment for City’s FFP breach also restricted spending to £49m net over this transfer window and the last. However, with UEFA allowing City to take an agreed £25m fee from Valencia for striker Alvaro Negredo, payable this coming summer, into account, they are comfortably within that margin.

Bony, therefore, will become the club’s 11th centre forward signed at a combined cost of about £275m since the takeover of August 2008.

Proof, perhaps, that the more some things change, the more they stay the same.
