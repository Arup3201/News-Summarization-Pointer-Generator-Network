If you want to buy one of these wallet-busting pizzas, you're going to need plenty of dough.

Steveston Pizza in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada, sell a range of pizzas piled high with rare seafood.

Nader Hatami, the restaurant's owner and head chef, says the $450 price tag shouldn't put customers off his costly creations.

'It's not your usual Friday night pizza,' he said.

'I just kept on going with the ingredients and I've sold about eight of these so far.

'All Steveston pizzas are made with fresh, specialty ingredients however for those that like to go to the next level in flavours there are a few extra special pies.'

The C6 pizza is topped with Thermidor of lobster, smoked black Alaskan cod, crème fraîche and a side order of Russian Osetra caviar.

Beautifully presented: Indeed, despite its cost, his are not the most expensive pizzas available, by far

'I just kept on going with the ingredients and I've sold about eight of these so far,' said Mr Hatami

Mr Hatami's creation is far from the world's most expensive pizza, however. That accolade belongs to Margo's Pizzeria in Malta, which in 2010 reportedly sold a pizza for a massive $2,380.

The thin crust came topped with white truffles, 24-carat gold leaf and buffalo mozzarella

While reliable rankings are hard to come by, second place may go to Nino's Bellissima Pizza in Manhattan, New York City, which claimed it had a huge hit with a £1,000 effort which came stacked with $820-worth of caviar.

Nino's owner, Nino Selimaj, said at the time that hundreds of wealthy New Yorkers had already snapped up the decadent dish, which included both Beluga and Black Russian Royal Sevruga caviars as toppings.

'People who know about their caviar love this pizza,' he said. 'We sell them to politicians, Wall Street traders, or couples celebrating a birthday or anniversary.'

So Mr Hatami has some way to go before he's battling the big boys in the niche market for pricey pizzas, but he's stepping up his game.

For Canadian food-lovers with serious money to burn, Steveston Pizza is now set to release an even more expensive version, the C7, which will cost a whopping $750.

It contains all of the ingredients from the C6 pizza but adds an additional topping of luxury white truffle carpaccio shavings.

All pizzas are divided into 10 slices, giving each piece a jaw-dropping price tag of $75 each.

But hungry pizza lovers must order their high brow meals one day in advance before they can pick them up.
