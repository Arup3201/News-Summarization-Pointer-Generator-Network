A married driving instructor has been caught cheating on his wife - after photos taken on a traffic camera of him kissing one of his pupils went viral in China. 

Hsin Sung, 43, from Foshan in southern China's Guangdong Province, thought he was safe from prying eyes as he parked his red Volkswagen in an underpass and embraced his student.

But he had no idea the traffic camera would catch him in the act - and that those photos would then end up all over China's social networking sites.

There's no licence for this! Hsin Sung is caught cheating on his wife with a pupil by a traffic camera

His wife T'ian was just one of millions who came across the photos online.

One user of China's social media website Weibo, named as YiMinSun3, said: 'Not only is he cheating on his wife, he's cheating on his bosses too.'

She added: 'It must be pretty nice work to get paid for doing that sort of thing.'

And another Weibo user, LuHsin, commented that the young woman was using the wrong driving stick.

The shamed driving instructor admitted to it being him in the photos, but claimed he was just trying to 'comfort' the student, saying that she had just failed a test.

'Yes, it's me on the film and this has caused me a lot of trouble with my wife. But my student was very upset and I was trying to help her regain her confidence. It was just to comfort her. That's all, I promise,' he said.

Managers from his driving school were furious that the road traffic surveillance video ended up being leaked to the internet, damaging the reputation of their company, and have made a formal complaint.

And the way the pictures emerged also angered some Chinese internet-users.

One, identified as SyingTsou, said: 'The only people with access to this video are government officials. It's pretty sick that they spy on people and then release the footage for fun.'
