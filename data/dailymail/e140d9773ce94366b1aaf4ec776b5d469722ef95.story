LeBron James scored 36 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers ended their six-game losing streak with a 109-102 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, despite Kobe Bryant's 19 points and career-high 17 assists.

The pair embraced on several occasions during the game, in particular when James missed a dunk, with Bryant grinning wildly after the former had turned around.

Kyrie Irving added 22 points for Cleveland, before James held off Bryant down the stretch in an entertaining duel between two basketball icons.

Bryant was all smiles as he took a break during the game and iced his knees on the bench

Bryant hit a 3-pointer with 1:54 left and two free throws with 43 seconds to play, cutting Cleveland's lead to 103-99. 

But James drove past Bryant for an acrobatic layup with 20.9 seconds left, and Bryant missed a jumper that essentially ended it.

Jordan Hill scored 20 points in the Lakers' ninth loss in 12 games.

It was a much-needed win for the Cavs, who had lost  nine out of 10 fixtures prior to the game, to initially fall to 19-20 and sixth in the Eastern Conference.
