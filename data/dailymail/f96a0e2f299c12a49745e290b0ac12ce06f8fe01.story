A black Saturday Night Live actor fed up with the show’s years long lack of any black female cast members says he refuses to dress in drag to fill the gap.

Kenan Thompson played many notable black women like Whoopi Goldberg during his first seven seasons on SNL but, as he show enters its sixth straight year without a black woman, Thompson says someone else can pick up the slack.

With just one other black man in this season’s cast and with six new cast members—all of them white—the person who will play this year’s Whoopis and Oprahs and Michelle Obamas remains to be seen.

SNL cast member Kenan Thompson has played many women, including Whoopi Goldberg, but this week he said no more. In protest of his show's lack of female black women, he won't fill the void

In a chat with TV Guide, Keenan suggested there’s a lack of top-notch black female talent making it to SNL auditions.

‘It's just a tough part of the business,’ Thompson says. ‘Like in auditions, they just never find ones that are ready.’

Over its nearly 40 years on the air, SNL has had a grand total of four black women on its cast: Yvonne Hudson, Danitra Vance, Ellen Cleghorne and Maya Rudolph.

After Rudolph’s departure in 2007, the show lacked a female of color and has ever since. 

Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right. She was on for one season in 1980-1982. Danitra Vance, left, spent the 1985-86 season on the show

No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since

For critics of the show’s casting habits, the most recent selection of six new cast members, all of them white and only one of them female, was salt in the wound.

Thompson’s refusal to wear drag in order to fill the void leaves viewers wondering who will and even Thompson doesn’t have the answer.

Token? In the midst of the furor over the show's recent casting of six more people, all white, SNL announced Kerry Washington would host in November. She'll be only the 5th woman of color to host since season 35

‘I don't know. We just haven't done them,’ he said. ‘Maybe [Jay Pharaoh] will do it or something, but even he doesn't really want to do it.’

Thompson and Pharaoh are the only two black cast members in this, the 39th SNL season.

In the wake of the scandal, SNL made a conspicuously timed announcement: Kerry Washington, the black star of hit show Scandal, will host the show in November.

But whether producers made the hosting choice to placate critics seeing red because of so much white on SNL, booking Washington doesn’t change the makeup of the cast.

And over the course of the last 90 episodes of the classic comedy series, only four women of color—two of them black and two Latinas—have been tapped as hosts.

There is hope for black comediennes, however. Jay Pharaoh suggest to theGrio that Thompson is wrong and that the talent is definitely out there.

‘They need to pay attention,’ Pharaoh said as he described the comedy chops of black actress Darmirra Brunson and called out SNL casting directors. ‘Why do I think she should be on the show? Because she's black first of all, and she's really talented. She's amazing. She needs to be on SNL. I said it. And I believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year.’

They're out there: While Thompson says talented black women aren't auditioning, his only black castmate Jay Pharaoh says actress Darmirra Brunson (left and right playing Beyonce and Rihanna) would be the perfect SNL addition
