A vast cloud of dust is thrown up as millions of hooves stampede down the banks of the Mara River in the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.

One by one the charging wildebeest throw themselves into the boiling river as they make the annual pilgrimage from Serengeti National Park in neighbouring Tanzania to greener pastures.

The river crossing is fraught with danger. Crocodiles lie in wait just a few yards in, hoping to snatch the younger or weaker creatures for an easy meal.

Journey: Every year 1.5 million wildebeest make the journey from Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the Maasai Mara in neighbouring Kenya

Stampede: As the herd heads down the steep bank and into the water, one wildebeest throws himself into the boiling river                          
Dramatic: A huge cloud of dust is thrown up for the banks of the Mara River as a herd of wildebeest risk their lives and plunge in

Leap of faith: All too aware of the dangers that lie ahead, two migrating wildebeest jump into the Mara River in Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, regardless

Incline: A breakaway group forge a new path down the steep bank before diving into the water. Out front, a pair of adults appear to be shepherding a calf across

Orderly: Having made their way to the edge of the river, this group form a queue before stepping into the abyss which is littered with danger for them

If that does not get them, they have to fight strong currents as they bid to make it across to the other side.

These dramatic images, taken by Moscow-based photographer Sergey Agapov, show one of natures most magnificent migrations.

Up to 1.5 million wildebeest are believed to make the journey every year.

Mr Agapov, a retired Presidential Security Service officer who turned his attentions to photography four years ago, said: 'Watching the wildebeest I feel excitement and respect because of their bravery in the face of risk, said Mr Agapov.

'These animals know that deadly danger awaits them in the river, yet thousands of them readily jump into death's face. This cannot leave anyone indifferent.'

Pastures new: The rib cage of the wildebeest at the back of the queue show why the herd is so keen to make it to the lush plains of Kenya

Magnificent: Former security officer Sergey Agapov captured the dramatic images during a trip to Kenya

Annual event: Every year wildebeest cross the Mara River into Kenya. Here a small group plunge into the treacherous waters in spite of the dangers that lay ahead

Jostling: The magnificent creatures clamber over each other at significant risk to their well-being as they venture out into the river

Head of steam: The sheer power of the herd is captured perfectly here as the wildebeest out front forges a path across the fast-flowing Mara

Power: Water is thrown up into the air, which has already been filled with the dust from more than four million wildebeest hooves

Finding their rhythm: As the horned-beasts make their way into deeper water, they start to swim across the lethal Mara

The migration takes place between July and October each year, but the mass exodus peaks in the month of August.Â 

Photographers from all over the world flock to Kenya at this time, with Mr Agapov admitting he had to start planning his trip eight months ahead.

He added: 'The most interesting part of photographing the migration is capturing them during the jump from the precipice into the river and during their run through the dust clouds.'

'You need to pick the right station and to be very lucky and patient to make a perfect snap.'

Safety: Having successfully navigated their way across the Mara, this group of Wildebeest battle their way through a narrow opening in the rocks

Onward: Back on dry land, another huge cloud of dust is kicked up as the wildebeest once again stampede towards the lush pastures of the Maasai Mara

Thirsty work: The wildebeest quench their thirst before heading up the bank. A group of zebra appear to have joined the throng. In the background, a hippo has a nap

Exhausted: The wildebeest are soaked to the skin and out of breath, but they make their way in single file back onto dry land

Pilgrimage: Every year about 1.5 million wildebeest cross into Kenya in the migration season between July and October
