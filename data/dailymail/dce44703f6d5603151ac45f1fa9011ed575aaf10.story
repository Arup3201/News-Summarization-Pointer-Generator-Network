When Talina Evans decided to treat her daughter to a longed for Barbie doll after weeks of begging, the worst she expected was a slightly lighter purse.

But the young mother could not believe her ears when her seven-year-old daughter's new toy apparently launched into a foul-mouthed four-letter outburst.

Ms Evans, 25, claims that she could hear the doll - which is based on Barbie’s web reality series, Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse - exclaiming 'What the f***?' as her daughter Demileigh played with it.

Talina Evans, 25, decided to treat her daughter, Demileigh, to a talking Barbie doll after she spent several months asking for one. But has since taken the doll away after she discovered an unfortunate sound problem

The mother has told of her shock after buying her seven-year-old daughter the Barbie doll - which seems to exclaim 'what the f***'

The doll is programmed to say 15 
different phrases, including 'Amaze', 'I love a makeover', 'There is no 
substitute for glitter', and 'To the salon!'.

But
 Ms Evans, who is currently pregnant with her second child, said she was
 left mortified when she claims to have heard the doll swear.

She
 attempted to return the Mattel toy to the Home Bargains store where she
 bought it - but was told there was nothing they could do because she 
had lost the receipt.

MailOnline
 has contacted Mattel for comment. It is believed the doll is actually 
programmed to say 'Off the hook' but, because of an unfortunate sound 
problem, it has been misheard by a number of customers as the foul-mouthed exclamation. 

Ms Evans, from Caernarfon, North Wales, said: ''She loved it and has been playing with it constantly ever since. We hadn’t really paid that much attention to it or what it was saying.

'Then a friend of ours picked up the toy and I heard it say ‘what the f**k’ loud and clear, I was so shocked.

The doll - operated by these buttons - is programmed to say 15 different phrases, including 'Amaze', 'I love a makeover', 'There is no substitute for glitter', and 'To the salon!'

'We’ve taken it off her now. We just told her that the doll had been bad and was swearing so it had to go.

'She was disappointed, of course, but she understood that it is wrong to swear and so the doll had to go.'

She added: 'I have tried taking the doll back but because I don’t have the receipt they say there is nothing they can do.

'I think it’s very irresponsible of the toy company - they know that children are going to be playing with these toys.

'I’m not the only one who has heard it. You can hear it loud and clear, it definitely says ‘what the f***’.'
