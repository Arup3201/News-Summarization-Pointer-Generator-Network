Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti claims that new £60million signing James Rodriguez was signed 'for the future' because big clubs require competition to succeed.

The 23-year-old Colombian signed for the club from Monaco on Tuesday and he joins stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos, Isco and Angel Di Maria in an extremely competitive midfield.

But Ancelotti insists it was necessary for Madrid to add such a talented player to their squad.

Future: Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti says he signed £60m James Rodriguez 'for the future' 

Looking ahead: Ancelotti thinks all big clubs need competition to succeed and Rodriguez gives Real that

Reach for the stars: James Rodriguez is the final piece in the most expensive team in world football

Two become three: Bale and Ronaldo will have to make room for one more superstar in the Madrid XI

He said: 'Madrid’s history will tell you that they always want to have the best players and ones with a future. We have signed one of the World Cup’s stars.

'You need these kinds of players for the future, not just for the present, too.'

The No10 has been given an extended holiday and will only return to pre-season training on August 1 alongside Frenchmen Karim Benzema and Raphael Varane. 

Ancelotti said: 'James finished the World Cup on 30 June and needs a month of holidays and a break.'

And, despite the wealth of competition that Madrid now have at their disposal, Ancelotti suggested he was keen to keep hold of Di Maria, who has been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain or Manchester United.

Expensive: £86m Gareth Bale

Rich: £60m James Rodriguez

Pricey: £80m Cristiano Ronaldo

Dream team: New acquisition Toni Kroos is one of many midfielders who will be challenging to play for Madrid

Stars: Cristiano Ronaldo is just one of a host of talented players who will make up the Real Madrid side

'Di Maria is a Real Madrid player,' he said.

'There's a lot more competition with Kroos and James, but I think at all big clubs there's competition.'

The 55-year-old Italian was also cautious to talk about the imminent arrival of Costa Rican stopper Keylor Navas from Levante in an £8m deal.

Ancelotti said: 'Keylor isn't a Real Madrid player. Right now we have the same three keepers as last year.

'We are in pre-season. Iker (Casillas) only starting training today. For us the goalkeeper isn't an issue.

Wanted: Ancelotti insisted that he wants to keep Angel Di Maria despite speculation over his future

Not just yet: Keylor Navas has not yet signed for Real Madrid for £8million, says manager Ancelotti

'Last year there were debates about it, but not for me.

'I'm going to decide at the start of the season who will be the starting keeper.

'Iker starts at the same level as others.' 

Madrid are currently in Los Angeles on a pre-season tour and they will play Inter Milan, Roma and Manchester United during their time in the US. 

Stopper: Costa Rica goalkeeper Navas, who enjoyed a great World Cup, is expected to sign for the club soon

Opportunity: Ancelotti insists he has not decided on his keeper for next season and it could be Iker Casillas
