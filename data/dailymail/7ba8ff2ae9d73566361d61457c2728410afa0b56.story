The traitorous Afghani soldier who gunned down three Australian army personnel in a 'green-on-blue' attack at a patrol base in 2012 is unrepentant, 'remarkably cheerful' and hopes to be released despite being sentenced to death.

That's according to a new Four Corners documentary which has revisited the tragic events of the evening of August 29, 2012. 

That night, Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier Sergeant Hekmatullah, 19, killed Private Robert  Poate, Sapper James  Martin and Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic with his M-16 rifle as they relaxed at Patrol Base Wahab, in the Baluchi Valley region of Oruzgan Province. Two other soldiers were wounded.

In the interview, Hekmatullah also asks the families of those he killed to forgive him, but reportedly said he would kill again.

Killed three Australian soldiers: Sergeant Hekmatullah 'seems remarkably cheerful for someone who's at least technically on death row'

The Australian soldiers were playing cards at Patrol Base Wahab (seen in this ABC re-enactment) when they came under attack by Afghan National Army soldier Sergeant Hekmatullah

While the rogue trooper is on death row at a prison in Kabul, the nation's capital, the country's government has not given the execution order.

'He is living in good conditions in this jail, he's put on weight and he seems remarkably cheerful for someone who's at least technically on death row,' ABC reporter Quentin McDermott said.

'When Four Corners interviewed him he was happy to talk about the incident and happy to talk about his hopes for the future.'  

After the attack, Hekmatullah fled Patrol Base Wahab for Pakistan. He was 'hailed as hero' by Taliban militants and spent around five months on the run until he was apprehended by security services in January 2013.

Hekmatullah was sentenced to death by an Afghan court in December.

Murdered: Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic

The temperature was stifling - over 40 degrees Celsius - on August 29, the day the Australian soldiers were attacked

Australian troops at Patrol Base Wahab were tasked with mentoring Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers

The rogue soldier told News Corp Australia in January he became enraged after he was shown a report about U.S. soldiers burning the Koran.

'There were some real nasty thoughts that I had in my head,' he was quoted saying. 

'I saw that video and went crazy'.

The ABC program comes as a Queensland coronial inquest last week examined the circumstances which led to the soldiers' death.

Troops from both countries were present at Patrol Base Wahab at the time of the incident.

The 24-strong Australian team had been tasked with mentoring ANA soldiers and ANA personnel had open access to the Australians.

Kelly Walton, the wife of fallen soldier Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic, also attended the inquest into her husband's death

Hekmatullah's attack came amid a spate of so-called 'green-on-blue' strikes by allied Afghani soldiers on Coalition forces.

According to The Long War Journal, insider attacks were responsible for 15 per cent of Coalition deaths in 2012.

Last year, the Australian Defence Force made public an internal investigation into the Patrol Base Wahab incident. 

Relatives of the killed soldiers  disagreed with its finding that intelligence failures had not played a role in the incident. 

The ABC report will reveal that secret orders circulated by U.S. military command warning of an increased threat of attack from rogue soldiers was not passed on to Australian soldiers.

The full interview with Sergeant Hekmatullah airs tonight on Four Corners: The Enemy Within, ABC1, 8:30pm AEDT.
