European captain Paul McGinley offered further hints about his possible pairings on the second day of official practice ahead of the 40th Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.

After sending his 12-man team out in four groups of three on Tuesday, McGinley reverted to three groups of four this morning, but with Rory McIlroy once more in the same group as Martin Kaymer and Victor Dubuisson again alongside Graeme McDowell. 

US Open champion Kaymer is a likely partner for McIlroy in foursomes, while McDowell said on Tuesday he was keen to act as a mentor to rookie Dubuisson after the 'dynamic' of his relationship with McIlroy had changed.
