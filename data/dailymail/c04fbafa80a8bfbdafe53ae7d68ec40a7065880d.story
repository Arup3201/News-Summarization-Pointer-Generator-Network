This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Bond film and Boyle with his crew have reportedly already been filming inside Buckingham Palace.

In the film Bond is ordered on his mission at Buckingham Palace and then flys by helicopter to Stratford, where he parachutes into the arena.

Crowds thronged both sides of the River Thames around iconic Tower Bridge as road traffic was stopped to allow the two helicopters to fly through.

The only time an aircraft has previously flown through Tower Bridge was in 1968.

Flight Lieutenant Alan Pollock 
flew an RAF Hawker Hunter plane through the bridge as a protest against 
the Government.

Road traffic on Tower Bridge and river 
traffic on the Thames was halted while the two helicopters made two 
passes through the middle of the famous bridge.

In 2009 a helicopter flew close to the bridge to film scenes for a Sherlock Holmes film, but did not actually fly through the bridge.

Boyle's Olympic opening ceremony is reportedly going to be a £27m four-hour spectacular that will feature a tribute to the NHS, a torch lighting sequence and a cast and crew of 12,000.
