Lauren Silverman didn't trick Simon Cowell into having a baby, because the New York socialite 'didn't think she could get pregnant,' a source said.

The married 36-year-old, who has a seven-year-old son with her husband Andrew, had reportedly 'been trying for a long time' to have another child, but doctors told her it wasn't possible and, according to the source, she had 'suffered a few miscarriages.'

'She and Simon were not using protection because doctors said she couldn't get pregnant,' the source told The New York Post.

However, because of her previous 
troubles with carrying a child, she is reportedly terrified she'll miscarry again.

'The only fear is that because of her
history of miscarriages that she might lose the child and end up with 
nothing,' the source said.

According
to the newspaper, Silverman and Cowell's affair began in 2011, after 
the 'X Factor' judge befriended the brunette's husband.

Silverman's parents are said to be thrilled at the baby news.

'(They)
are delighted she is pregnant with Simon's child, partly because 
there's a baby on the way, but more that the father is a wealthy 
celebrity who will take care of her.'

MailOnline reached out to Silverman and Cowell for comment but have not yet received a response.

According to another report in The Post, the socialite had to wait over a year and a half to divorce her husband.

Silverman
was allegedly holding off on breaking the news about her affair with 
Cowell until the 10-year mark in her marriage so the terms of her 
pre-nup would kick in - awarding her $3 or $4 million.

'This is just another example of her going for the money,' a source from Andrew's camp told The Post.

Friends of the Silvermans told MailOnline that waiting until the decade mark before divorcing was 'more lucrative' for Lauren.

They also said that Andrew's parents didn't attend their wedding because 'they did not approve of the relationship, they didn't have a good feeling about her and the relationship.'

The friends also said they were 'aware of the rumors of other conquests by Lauren.'

The Silvermans plan to make their split official early this week.

Yesterday, Silverman looked despondent as she took a break from the crisis talks with her husband to buy some toys for her son.

Silverman put her hands on the counter of the toy store and stared into space - looking like she had a weight on her shoulders.

Her stare was only broken when she saw her son Adam, seven, come to her side and she broke into a smile and stared at him.

Lauren had taken Adam away from her $4million home in Bridgehampton, New York as a break from crisis talks with her husband Andrew on her affair with Cowell.

They left around 10 a.m. in a Range Rover being driven by her handler and drove for five minutes to a nearby shopping center where they went into a shop called Second Star Toys.

Lauren browsed for a few minutes before taking a large box of Legos to the counter.

She could be heard apologizing to 
staff for all the attention she was getting and was led out the back 
door where the Range Rover was waiting.

Lauren
was dressed casually in a loose fitting white shirt with a red pattern 
on it, dark-colored shorts and tan gladiator sandals.

A woman who works at Second Star Toys declined to comment after she had left.

While Lauren was out Andrew drove off at speed from their home in his Mercedes Gullwing sports car. He declined to comment.
