Broadway heir Eric Nederlander racked up his third arrest relating to a threatening altercation with his on-off girlfriend.

Nederlander, 46, spent a night in a Manhattan jail after allegedly stealing Nancy Okun's keys and trying to break into her apartment in a jealous rage.

'You f***ing b****! You're cheating on me!' he screamed as he tried to break into Ms Okun's West Village apartment around 1am on Thursday morning.

This latest incident is the third time that she has called the police on Nederlander in the past year.

The first came in July of last year, when he allegedly slammed her head into the Plexiglass divider of a taxi during an argument and followed her up to her Greenwich Village apartment, outside of which he proceeded to punch and shoved her.

Scion: Eric Nederlander was arrested for violating a protection order when he allegedly pulled his girlfriend's hair

Because Ms Okun, who had been dating Nederlander 'for years' at the time of the July 19 incident, decided not to prosecute, Nederlander was able to plead down to disorderly conduct and had to complete 26 weeks of anger management classes.

The classes apparently did not take, as he reportedly went on to aggressively pull her hair while she was sleeping.

That January incident violated the limited order of protection that was filed after the first altercation. The order allowed the couple to still live together but said that he was forbidden from assaulting or harassing Ms Okun.

There are marked similarities between the January incident and the latest arrest, since he yelled 'You're cheating on me!' while he pulled her hair.

The New York Post reports that the most recent altercation happened when Ms Okun woke up around 1am and found that Nederlander was no longer in her apartment and had stolen her spare set of keys.

About two hours later, he tried to open the door using the spare keys, and then used his body to attempt to push past two deadbolts.

The police complaint states that he 'attempted to push open the door through the two deadbolt locks on the door by applying his body weight to the door.'

Wife number two: Nederlander and his second wife Lindsey Kupferman- who looks rather similar to Ms Okun- have a daughter together named Mira and Nederlander feared the latest incident would result in custody issues

First marriage: Nederlander was famously married to Jessica Sklar for just three weeks. She left him for comedian Jerry Seinfeld after they met at the gym

Nederlander, who comes from a wealthy theater family and was briefly married to Jessica Sklar before she met and married comedian Jerry Seinfeld, has had run ins with the law in the past before he began dating Ms Okun.

His second wife, Lindsey Kupferman, got a restraining order against him when she divorced him just seven weeks after giving birth to their daughter Mira.

At the time, Nederlander blamed his behavior on male postpartum depression.

He and Kupferman are still battling it out in court over custody of their daughter.
