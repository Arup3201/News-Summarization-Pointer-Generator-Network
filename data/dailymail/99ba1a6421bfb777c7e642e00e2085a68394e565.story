Fire has destroyed a historic New Jersey inn that once hosted George Washington.

Firefighters found smoke coming from The Sergeantsville Inn in Delaware Township early Monday.

But flames eventually tore through the roof of the two-story stone structure that is more than 300 years old.

All that remains: The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Inn owner Joe Clyde says he plans to rebuild, if possible.  Above, Joe's wife Lisa Clyde (left) is hugged by neighbors in the aftermath of the fire

Mayor Roger Locandro tells CBS that the inn is the center of the town.

'This is the place people would come after a township meeting. The town hall is right across the street. My kids have had their birthday parties there. It’s a terrible loss for our community,' Locandro said. 

The cause of the fire is still under investigation. One firefighter sustained a minor knee injury fighting the blaze.

Owner Joe Clyde told the Hunterdon County Democrat that he plans to rebuild the inn if possible.

Mr Clyde and his wife lisa have been running the property as a fine-dining restaurant since 1999.

Loss: Mayor  Roger Locandro described the Sergeantsville Inn as the center of the town, where people would eat on special occasions 

The original part of the building traces back to the 1700s when it was built as a private home in the village then called Skunktown, according to the restaurant's website.

When a post office opened in the town in 1827, the name was changed to Sergeantsville.

Another addition was added in 1830, and in 1869 the building was sold to a Farley Shepherd who ran a general inside.

His son Edward took over the business in 1900 and during the 1930s, the store was run as both an ice cream parlor and feed store.

Its next owner John Balanar obtained a liquor license for the store at the end of prohibition, and it was run as a tavern for several years.

Restaurant: The Clydes have run the Sergeantsville Inn since 1999. Before that, the building was used as a tavern, ice cream parlor, private home,  and general store at different periods in the past. Owner Joe Clyde is seen on the left, wearing a hat. His wife Lisa, center

Many lives: The original part of the building traces back to the 1700s when it was built as a private home in the village then called Skunktown, according to the restaurant's website.
