A secret tunnel from Mexico into the U.S. has been found by customs officials.

The highly sophisticated tunnel runs underneath the border connecting the Mexican city of Tijuana with San Diego, California.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the passage had been recently completed. Officials didn't elaborate any further in a brief statement.

Mexican news organizations published photos that show a deep, well-built tunnel near Tijuana airport.

The airport is four miles away from the American border by road, but only a matter of yards away in a straight line.

Alberto Capella, Tijuana's public safety chief, said a law enforcement operation was underway and he couldn't provide any more details.

Dozens of tunnels have been discovered along the border in recent years, designed largely to smuggle marijuana to the United States.

Last year, a 240-yard drug-smuggling tunnel was unearthed in Arizona. 

The Mexican Army also found a second incomplete tunnel under a bathroom sink in Tijuana that went 200 yards into San Diego, California.

The Tijuana tunnel had been under investigation by US authorities for three months, and they found no connections to the smuggling operation involving the Arizona passageway.

It takes between six months and a year to build a tunnel, authorities say. Workers use shovels and pickaxes to slowly dig through the soil, sleeping in buildings where the tunnels begin until the job is done. Sometimes they use pneumatic tools.

A total of 156 secret tunnels have been found along the border since 1990, but the vast majority were incomplete.

Raids last November on two tunnels linking San Diego and Tijuana netted a combined 52 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border.

In early December 2009, authorities found an incomplete tunnel that stretched nearly 900 feet into San Diego from Tijuana, equipped with an elevator at the Mexican entrance.

This tunnel was said to have cost more than £930,000 to build.
