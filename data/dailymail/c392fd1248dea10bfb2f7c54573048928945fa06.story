The Old Bailey heard that details of injuries sustained by Prince Harry on holiday were reported in the News of the World after his aide's phone was allegedly hacked

A News of the World exclusive on Prince Harry injuring himself on holiday came directly from a hacked voicemail left for his personal assistant, the Old Bailey heard today. 

Dr Rod Jaques left a message for the Prince's aide Helen Asprey detailing the young Royal's shoulder and foot injuries picked up while on holiday. 

On January 23, 2005, a story titled 'Harry gets two Nazi new injuries', concerning shoulder and foot complaints that may scupper his hopes of joining Sandhurst Military Academy appeared in the Sunday tabloid. 

The transcript of the hacked voicemail from the doctor was shown to the jury, going into the injury details and possible treatments. 

It also makes reference to a planned appointment for the Prince, on January 24, which is referenced in the NoTW story. 

Dr Jaques told police: 'The message was for Helen Asprey and her alone. 

'It related to a patient I had recently treated.' 

Clive Goodman, who penned the exclusive, emailed Coulson on January 22, 2005, telling him the doctor information had been 'scammed from Helen Asprey (Harry and William's PA) so it's solid'. 

The court heard Ms Asprey was the victim of hundreds of hacks by Goodman and the News of the World at the end of 2005 through to the middle of 2006. 

She said: 'In December 2005, I became aware of problems with my voicemail service. 

'Messages not previously listened to were being described as old rather than new, and the PIN number was changing and being reset regularly, sometimes several times a day.'

Another royal aide, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, was also hacked repeatedly, and one of his messages was allegedly the source of a Goodman story claiming Harry had cheated on his Sandhurst exams. 

Goodman, who has admitted phone hacking, handed a transcript to prosecutors of a phone message from Prince Harry pleading for help with an essay on the Iranian embassy siege.

The message, taken from Mr Lowther-Pinkerton's phone, said: 'I just need some inf.'

'If you have any information at all or know where to get information from, or you could send me a text or email me, any info on the siege at the Iranian Embassy, because I need to do an essay quite quickly on that. 

'I've got most of the stuff but if you have any extra information or websites that you know of, please, please, please, email it to me or text me.' 

Another story alleged to have come from hacking was of a boozy night at the barracks involving the two Princes. 

When Edmondson suggests adding an extra line, Goodman replies by email: 'That's a bit too much knowledge to expose to a wider readership. 

'Massively dangerous to the source.' 

When the newspaper turned its attention to Tom Parker Bowles, an emaill shown to the jury where Goodman told Weatherup: 'Got a mobile, getting Greg to do a few dark arts.' 

Weatherup replied: 'Don't know what you mean....'

The trial continues.    

Victim: Gordan Taylor, head of the PFA, was hacked repeatedly by the News of the World who wrongly claimed he had an affair, the Old Bailey heard today

News of the World reporters wrongly assumed Professional Footballers' Association boss Gordon Taylor was having an affair with his son’s ex-girlfriend based on hacked messages, the Old Bailey heard today.

Transcripts of voicemails left for the PFA chief executive were emailed between staff at the Sunday tabloid when they believed an affair was going on.

In an email to news editors James Weatherup and Ian Edmondson, chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck sent voicemail transcripts and bragged: ‘This is a splash any day of the week.’

He added: ‘We know it’s happening.’

Mr Taylor was suspected by the reporters of having an affair with Joanne Armstrong, an in-house lawyer at the PFA.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court: ‘The media were investigating an allegation that Joanne Armstrong and Gordon Taylor were having an affair.’

NotW private investigator Glenn Mulcaire had recordings of 76 voicemails from Mr Taylor’s phone in his home when he was arrested in August 2006.

Phone records show he made 13 calls to Mr Taylor’s phone between February and May 2006.

People who left messages that were hacked included BBC pundit Garth Crooks, Paul Gascoigne’s best friend Jimmy ‘Five Bellies’ Gardner, and colleagues at the PFA.

Thurlbeck, who has admitted hacking, then drafted the story which he emailed to Edmondson on July 1, 2005.

The top line read: ‘Soccer boss Gordon Taylor is having a secret affair with his son’s former girlfriend.’

Mulcaire’s notes had the details of Mr Taylor and Ms Armstrong in his notebook on a page dated May 6, 2004.

The jury were shown two agreements between the News of the World and Mulcaire, using the alias Paul

Williams, agreeing not to give the Taylor information to other newspapers.

Guilty: Former News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, pictured at a previous hearing, has already admitted phone hacking charges

The first was signed by Miskiw on February 4, 2005, and a similar agreement was signed by Edmondson on May 9, the court heard.

Detective Constable Richard Oskiewicz said: ‘It appears to be an agreement in relation to the Gordon Taylor story, and appears to follow on to the agreement on February 24, 2005.

‘This one is dated June 24, 2005, and is by Ian Edmondson.’

On June 29, 2005, NotW reporter Ross Hindley sent a transcript of Mr Taylor’s voicemails was emailed to Thurlbeck, two days before the draft copy was sent to Edmondson.

Edmondson is in the dock accused of being involved in phone hacking, along with editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, and managing editor Stuart Kuttner, in a six year phone hacking campaign at the Sunday tabloid.

The alleged victims include Home Secretaries David Blunkett and Charles Clarke, murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, and glamour model Abi Titmuss.

The court heard today UKip leader Nigel Farage was also a victim of Mulcaire’s, whose phone was hacked in January 2006 when he was accused of having an extra marital affair.

It also emerged that Rebekah Brooks was herself a victim of 'extensive' phone hacking by Mulcaire, the court heard.

The former editor's name, phone number and voicemail number was on a page in the private investigator's notebook.

'Mrs Brooks was herself the victim of extensive hacking herself was she not?', said Jonathan Laidlaw QC, acting for Brooks.

DC Tim Hargreaves replied: 'She was targeted, yes.'

Her
details were on a second page in the book, along with the name of News 
International lawyer Tom Crone scrawled halfway down. 

Mr
Laidlaw told court: 'Having found those pages, it was identified to her
that she appeared to have been the victim of hacking.

'Do you know another Met officer asked whether she was prepared to be a witness for the prosecution?'

DC
Hargreaves said he was unaware of this approach, and Mr Laidlaw added: 
'Not only was the fact of hacking revealed to her, but she was invited 
by the police to provide a witness statement to act as a witness to 
this.'

Brooks' name, 
then under her maiden name Wade, was also found on a page containing the
details of Sienna Miller and Jude Law, the court heard.

Victim: Former News International Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks, pictured with her husband Charlie (left) today, was also a victim of 'extensive' hacking by the News of the World, the court heard

Royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, is accused with Coulson of corruption, while Brooks faces corruption charges for her time as editor of The Sun.

Brooks is then accused of masterminding a cover-up with husband Charles, 50, News International head of security Mark Hanna, 50, and PA Cheryl Carter, 49, when she knew she was about to be arrested.

Rebekah Brooks, of Jubilee Barn, Churchill, Chipping Norton, Coulson, of Hart Hill, Charing, Kent, Edmondson, of Blenheim Road, Raynes Park, south London, and Kuttner, of Broomhill Walk, Woodford Green, Essex, all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications.

Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.

Coulson, with Clive Goodman, of Woodham Lane, Woodham, Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office.

Carter, of Mildmay Road, Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Glynswood Road, Buckingham, Bucks, and Charles Brooks, of Jubilee Barn, Churchill, Chipping Norton all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

The trial continues.
