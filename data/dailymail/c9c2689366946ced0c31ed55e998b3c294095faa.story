A hospital could face a huge compensation bill after it hired a private firm to remove cataracts and half the patients treated suffered complications.

Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton hired private provider Vanguard in May to help reduce a backlog.

But the hospital terminated the contract after only four days after 31 of the 62 patients who had the operation reported complications including blurred vision, pain and swelling.

One 84-year-old man claimed he has lost his sight and his family is calling for a full independent inquiry.

Some of the patients, including the 84-year-old man, have contacted lawyers to discuss seeking compensation, which raises the prospect of an NHS hospital picking up the bill for procedures done by a private health company.

Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust refused to talk in detail or discuss pay-outs when approached by The Guardian Newspaper, but a senior member of staff told the local newspaper that the hospital would be liable for any payments.

Colin Close, Musgrove Park’s medical director, told the Somerset Country Gazette: ‘Any financial responsibility would rest with us.

‘If any patients wish to pursue compensation, we would work with them.’

He added: ‘We still don’t know exactly what the cause is – we’re trying to identify that at the moment. There could be a range of causes.’

Vanguard Healthcare Solutions, which carried out some of the procedures, said patient care was the number one priority and they were fully investigating the root causes of any complications (stock image)

Dr Close said he would normally expect one in 400 patients to experience these complications.

A spokesman for Musgrove Park told The Guardian: ‘Due to the ongoing nature of our investigations it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the sequence of events surrounding the unfortunate complications experienced by our patients receiving cataract surgery with Vanguard Healthcare in their mobile theatre onsite at Musgrove Park hospital.

‘Our first and foremost concern has always been our patients, and particularly those who have experienced complications. 

'We have been in very close contact with them since the incident to ensure they are fully informed with our progress and receive the highest quality aftercare and treatment. 

'We will want to discuss the outcomes of our investigations with them first, once they have reached conclusion.’

Ian Gillespie, chief executive of Vanguard Healthcare Solutions, said: ‘Patient care is our number one priority and we’re working closely with the trust to understand and fully investigate the root causes of any complications.

‘This investigation is still ongoing, making it inappropriate to comment on specific issues or on individual patient cases. 

'Operations were carried out in Vanguard’s operating theatre by highly qualified surgeons, approved by the hospital, and with many years’ experience of working in the NHS.’
