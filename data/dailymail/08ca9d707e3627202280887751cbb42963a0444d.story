Doctors operating on a high school football player who had broken his leg discovered that the young man had a giant tumor growing in his body.

Max O'Rourke, a star quarterback for the Rocklin High Thunder in Rocklin, California, was rushed to the hospital Friday night after breaking his leg during a game, initially devastated that the injury meant his season would be cut short.

That all changed however when doctors discovered the 17-year-old had a large benign tumor growing in his leg.

Blessing: Rocklin High quarterback Max O'Rourke (above with a friend) discovered he had a giant tumor growing in his leg after being admitted to the hospital with a broken femur Friday night

Getting better: O'Rourke (before surgery on left and with a friend on right) has had the tumor successfully removed, but now will not be able to walk for seven weeks

The tumor was revealed when doctors took an x-ray of O'Rourke's leg to get a better look at his broken femur.

The leg was broken when a defender tackled Max as he went to throw a pass during the game, and hit the ground at an odd angle.

Doctors also believe the bone was weakened by the tumor, which was putting an immense amount of pressure on O'Rourke's leg.

'I didn’t expect to be in this situation, but here I am, and you can either live with it or you can just be angry at the world,' O'Rourke told CBS 13.

'And I chose to live with it and be positive.'

Doctors say that he should be walking again, without assistance, in seven weeks.

Staying strong: 'I chose to live with it and be positive,' says O'Rourke of news of the tumor (seen above with his friend Melissa at Homecoming just days before surgery)

'A tragic moment to a blessing in disguise,' is how Max's father Michael is now describing the event.

Adds his mother, Erin, 'His legs going to be that much stronger, he’s going to be that much more driven and I think he has been a huge inspiration to his teammates.'

And while the young man and his family are staying positive, that doesn't make it any easier for the player, ranked one of the best in the state, to have to sit out his final season of high school football.

'Up until this point I had only missed one game, ever, my entire football career,”said O'Rourke, who is now focusing on returning in time to play on his high school basketball team this winter.

'It just sucks not being out there anymore.'
