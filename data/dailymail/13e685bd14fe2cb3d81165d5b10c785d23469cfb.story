His mother is famous for her chic sense of style, while his Aunt Pippa is no stranger to making fashion headlines of her own.

Now it would appear that Prince George's grandmothers are making a bid for the title of most fashionable female relative after both put in strong performances at his christening.

Camilla, who exchanged an air kiss with the Queen as she arrived at the Chapel Royal at St James' Palace, looked wonderful in an all-cream ensemble, complete with a cosy bouclé coat and a multi-strand pearl necklace.

Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole, who arrived a few minutes ahead of the royal party, was resplendent in a Catherine Walker designed off-white dress and tailored navy coat livened up with a chic lace panel.

Perfectly-groomed Carole, who smiled broadly as she arrived for the intimate ceremony accompanied by husband Michael and children Pippa and James, teamed her coat with a soft grey satin trimmed straw hat by milliner Jane Corbett.

Both grandmothers plumped for comfortable low-heeled leather court shoes that kept attention firmly on their outfits,

The pair joined the Duchess of Cambridge, who looked elegant in a cream ruffled suit by Alexander McQueen and a £755 bespoke Jane Taylor hat, and other members of the royal family including Prince Harry and the Queen, for the event, which was attended by just 22 people.

But although it was Prince George's big day, all eyes were on his grandmothers - both of whom have raised their style game in recent years.

Camilla's understated, regal style has been finessed since her 2005 wedding to Prince Charles, with designers such as Anna Valentine and Bruce Oldfield taking pride of place in her wardrobe.

Key pieces include flattering coat-dresses and elegant knee-length shift dresses which the duchess teams with pieces from her enviable jewellery collection.

The majority of the duchess' hats are bespoke and the work of some of the UK's biggest millinery names, among them Phillip Treacey and Nerida Fraiman, who also makes hats for her nieces Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

By contrast, Carole Middleton shares her eldest daughter's thrifty approach to fashion with much of her wardrobe purchased on the high street.

Like her daughters Kate and Pippa, Carole has a penchant for Whistles and Zara, but is known to splash out on occasion.

At the 2011 royal wedding, Carole plumped for Catherine Walker, who also designed her ensemble for the christening of Prince George, and chose a flattering Orla Kiely tea dress for her first meeting with her grandson at the Lindo Wing in June.
