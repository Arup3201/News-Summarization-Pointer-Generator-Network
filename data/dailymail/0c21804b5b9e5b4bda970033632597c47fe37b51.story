What do you buy the pirate-loving multimillionaire who has everything? Their own Caribbean oasis of course.

Except this 60-acre island paradise is more than 4,500miles away from the traditionally pirate-infested waters surrounding the Bahamas.

It is nestled in the middle of the English countryside in Cambridgeshire, where the island has been built from scratch in a lake on a private estate.

Paradise: Challis Island was built on a private estate in Cambridgeshire and includes a private beach, stream and lagoon

Plenty of grog: The island comes complete with its own pub The Black Dubloon

Pieces of eight: The island was commissioned by a young multimillionaire with a penchant for pirates

Challis Island was built for a wealthy landowner who 'loves all things pirate'. He is under 40 but wants to keep his identity private.

The pirate paradise includes a fully-working pub The Black Dubloon, a guest house dubbed Coffer's Cabin, a beach hut and a sun deck for Caribbean barbecues, which will be used by the owner and his guests.

All the buildings were made from wooden oak and Douglas fir frames, with roofs made from cedar tiles or thatch for authenticity.

Detailed: The island was built to an exact specification by specialist company The Master Wishmakers

Palatial: The island comes with a guesthouse called The Coffer's Cabin containing a 'pirate bed'

Fantasy: The island comes complete with its own beach and beach hut as well as a lagoon and waterfall

Life's a beach: The wealthy owner of the island was inspired by his 'love of all things pirate'

The island was built to a height of 3m out of the lake from scratch, and includes landscape features such as a beach, stream, lagoon and waterfall.

It was hand-built by The Master Wishmakers, who specialise in making wealthy clients' dreams come true without using 'plastic imitation theme park trickery'.

A spokesman said: 'We pride ourselves on our attention to detail and this is why we have worked with only the best scenic artists to add those final touches that really make Challis Island the most spectacular pirate adventure since the 18th Century.'

Entertaining space: The deck provides plenty of room for barbecues and dancing

Quirky: The island is an unusual use of the lake on the Cambridgeshire estate
