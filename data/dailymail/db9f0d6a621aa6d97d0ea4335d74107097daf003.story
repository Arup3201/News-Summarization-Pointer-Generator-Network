A family is suing a New Jersey school district, contending that the phrase 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance is discriminatory toward atheist children.

The lawsuit against the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District was filed in state court last month and announced Monday by the American Humanist Association.

The group says the phrase, added in 1954, 'marginalizes atheist and humanist kids as something less than ideal patriots.'

The anonymous plaintiffs say those two words violate the state constitution.

According to the suit, the humanist group complained to school officials in February, but the district would not change the pledge.

David Niose, an attorney for the American Humanist Association’s Appignani Humanist Legal Center, said public schools should not permit an exercise that 'teaches students that patriotism is tied to a belief in God.'

'Such a daily exercise portrays atheist and humanist children as second-class citizens, and certainly contributes to anti-atheist prejudices,' Niose said in a statement reported Fox News. 

But school district lawyer David Rubin said the district is merely following a state law that requires schools to have a daily recitation of the pledge.

In March last year Enidris Siurano Rodríguez, a sophomore at Damascus High School in Montgomery County, faced suspension for refusing to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance

He told NorthJersey.com that individual students do not have to participate.

'We are disappointed that this national organization has targeted Matawan-Aberdeen for merely obeying the law as it stands,' Rubin said in a written statement.

The group is awaiting a ruling from a court on a similar case in Massachusetts.

In March last year a high school student faced suspension for refusing to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.

Enidris Siurano Rodríguez, a sophomore at Damascus High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, had refused to participate in the daily pledge since she was in seventh grade because of the federal government's policies toward her native Puerto Rico.

The American Civil Liberties Union became and filed a complaint against the school, saying it is Enidris' right to sit in silence during the pledge.

A group in one Massachusetts town wants to ban students from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in the public schools, saying it is reminiscent of a totalitarian regime.
