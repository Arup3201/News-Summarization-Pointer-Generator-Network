This is the astonishing moment a chef at one of the country's top restaurants tried to defend his diners with a rolling pin from a mob of masked rioters during last summer's riots.

Dressed from head to toe in chef's whites, CCTV footage shows the man emerging from the kitchen bravely wielding the rolling pin as 15 youths rampaged around The Ledbury in Notting Hill.

But moments later an unknown rioter wrestles it from him and uses it to attack the chef who's forced to back away.

Attack:
This is the moment a top chef from the Ledbury tried to defend diners 
from rioters with a rolling pin. But a rioter grabs the rolling pin from him and uses it to hit him on the shoulder and the chef is forced to back away

Raid: Masked youths wielding poles, knives and 
baseball bats stormed Michelin-starred restaurant The Ledbury, in Notting Hill robbing 
diners of designer watches, cash, jewellery and phones

Terror: One rioter is seen rifling through what appears to be the till while other hooded members of the mob start searching under tables, in bags and coat pockets for any valuables they can get their hands on

Terrified diners fell to the floor as
the mob, wielding wine bottles, sticks and baseball bats, forced their 
way into the Michelin-starred restaurant on August 8 last year stealing 
their cash, phones and jewellery.

They are seen in the footage rifling through bags and coat pockets of about 40 wealthy customers while one woman had her wedding ring ripped from her finger.

One looter is seen rifling through drawers and what appears to be a till.

The mob were among a huge group of about 50 gang members who laid siege to shops and businesses in Queensway and Notting Hill ‘like a pack of hounds’ that night.

Targeted: Diners at The Ledbury in Notting Hill were robbed at knifepoint

As well as The Ledbury, they attacked the Bumpkin Restaurant, a casino and 
shops including an off-licence where the owner was battered over the 
head and left bleeding. A taxi and a pizza delivery driver were also 
attacked and police vehicles were bombarded.

Yesterday's sentences for the 16 gang members, who were 
described by Judge Karu as ‘like a pack of hounds’, added up to a total 
of 73 years.

It has also emerged that one rioter, Nasir Muhsen, 18, was living in a £3million apartment, funded by British taxpayers.

He and his family were housed in one of 
London’s most fashionable areas after they fled Iraq to claim asylum in 
Britain but he claimed to be so poor that he joined the riots to steal 
money for food.

defendants, aged between 15 and 25, whooped with joy and shouted 
obscenities and laughed as the judge passed sentence

Rioter: Nasir Muhsen was living in a £3million apartment, funded by British taxpayers

Yesterday Muhsen was locked up for 
six and a half years at Inner London Crown Court after racking up what a
judge called a ‘handsome record for violence’ after coming to Britain.

Sneering
with contempt for the judge and laughing as he swaggered to the cells, 
he joked: ‘Obviously I want more, I want to remain in prison.’

The
Mail can now reveal that Muhsen and his family trashed their 
six-bedroom flat in a grand Victorian mansion block in Kensington after 
being housed there by the council.

To the fury of neighbours, who include a naval admiral, they enjoyed a 3,000 sq ft basement apartment just by Earls Court.

The property, which if rented on the 
private market could command around £6,000 a month, had been refurbished
before their arrival last year.

But
by the time the family were evicted last Christmas for not paying their
heavily subsidised rent to the council, it was in such a bad state that
builders had to spend ten days on repairs.

One neighbour said: ‘They were like animals. All the wardrobes were ripped out. It had been gutted.

‘The
windows were broken, the doors were off. It looked like it had been 
party central. People came and went all times of the night. They trashed
it.’

Muhsen was living at 
the plush property with his mother and brothers at the time of the 
riots, yet his defence lawyer, Rupert Bowers, argued: ‘He had no income,
the money he took was to buy food.’

Muhsen, who a month after the riots was jailed for another robbery, has convictions dating back to 2009.

He
was given a youth rehabilitation order after being convicted of 
wounding and possession of an offensive weapon in 2010 and robbery in 
June 2011.

But like 
many of the gang members, he breached the order to join the riots, 
during which he was part of a group that ransacked an off-licence, 
battering the terrified shopkeeper over the head eight times with a 
bottle of champagne.

Yesterday Judge Usha Karu jailed Muhsen for six and a half years for conspiracy to commit violent disorder and robbery.

The
court heard that Muhsen was part of a mob of more than 50 youths from 
rival gangs who teamed up for a night of ‘devastating’ disorder.

She told them:
‘It was a year ago today that you were involved in the mob criminality 
that so disturbed the law-abiding members of the public.'

Today,
in stark contrast to the scenes of arson, looting and damage, London is
hosting the Olympics, which demonstrates the excellence which can be 
achieved in sport and is an inspiration to all.

'However, those involved in these events were intent on the opposite.’

In
extraordinary scenes, many of the defendants, aged between 15 and 25, 
whooped with joy, shouting obscenities and laughing as the judge passed 
sentence.

One, Karl Jensen,
was stepping out of a shoe shop on the night of the rioting, clutching 
boxes full of stolen trainers, when he was pinned to the ground by One 
Show presenter Dan Snow.

Jensen, 25, had been out of prison for just ten days after serving a five-year sentence for robbery.

Yesterday
he laughed as he was sentenced to three years in jail. Having already 
served a year on remand, he will be eligible for release in only six 
months.

On the subject of 
the lavish accommodation previously given to Muhsen and his family, 
Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, leader of the Royal Borough of 
Kensington and Chelsea, said yesterday: ‘It is important to note that 
rent levels for local housing allowance are not set by councils but by 
the Department for Work and Pensions.

‘But
we welcome the cap introduced by the Coalition Government that will 
ensure that taxpayers no longer fund unreasonable levels of housing 
benefit.’
