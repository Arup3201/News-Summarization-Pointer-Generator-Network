Libby Lane thought she was making  history this month as the first woman bishop for the Church of England.

But it seems she was pipped to the post by an 11-year-old schoolgirl.

Rebecca Howarth, from Manchester, became Britain's first female bishop when she took over from the Bishop of Manchester at the beginning of December - a post she will hold until Epiphany on January 6.

At just 11 years old,  Rebecca Howarth has accepted the role of 'girl priest' in her local Oldham Parish Church

The service where Rebecca took over from the current Bishop of Manchester, left, at the beginning of December involved her pulling him out of his chair and sitting in it herself wearing her ceremonial robes

The ceremonial post has always been held by a boy but with the church's new rulings about women, the schoolgirl is making history of her own. 

She told The Telegraph: 'I was really excited ever since I found out I was going to be girl bishop.

'Really women are just as good as boys I think, they’re both equal to each other. If a boy can be bishop, I don’t see why girls can’t. I just believe that girls have a right to be as good as boys.'

As regular churchgoers, Rebecca said her parents are very supportive of her new position, although her little sister feels a bit left out.

Her priest suggested Rebecca for the role. 'Father Derek asked my mum if I wanted to think about it and as soon as I agreed it was announced in church.

'They’d decided it would be nice to have a girl. If I’d disagreed there were lots of others who would have done it,' she said.

The Medieval tradition sees the serving Bishop of Manchester symbolically step down from his duties at the church and a young church member take over the responsibilities during the festive season. 

Rebecca was officially invested at a special service on Monday by the bishop, David Walker. 

During the ceremony, she had to pull him out of his chair and sit in it herself. 

Church warden Marlene Armitage told the Manchester Evening News: 'Rebecca is our first ever girl bishop and she will be the country’s first female bishop because the first female bishop hasn’t yet been appointed after the decision was made to allow female bishops.

'We met to decide who would make a good bishop and Rebecca is a lovely girl and she comes to church every week. 

'We asked the Bishop David Walker if we could have a girl bishop and he gave his approval.'

Libby Lane made history when she was announced as the Church Of England's first woman bishop

Rev Libby Lane, 48, was recently announced as the first female bishop in the Church of England.

The saxophone-playing mother-of-two has spent much of her career working in the north east and was announced as the new Bishop of Stockport, an assistant in the Chester Diocese.

The historic move came a month after the General Synod in York approved legislation to elevate women to the position and 20 years after the first women were ordained as priests.

The Rev Lane who was not the bookmakers’ favourite for the role, said she was grateful for the opportunity but admitted she was 'somewhat daunted' by the position.
