Banker Stephen Hester faced calls to forfeit his bonus and fall on his sword yesterday after the computer meltdown continued to cause chaos for millions.

A leading peer said there was ‘no question’ of the Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive receiving an annual  bonus from the state-owned bank – if he was allowed to keep his job.

His remarks came as it emerged the software support team for the at-fault computer programme is based in India.

'Out of touch': Outspoken Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott has said there is 'no question' of Stephen Hester, chief executive of Natwest parent RBS, receiving a bonus from the state-controlled bank this year

As well as his short-term bonus, 
Hester is also eligible for £7.9million of long term incentive awards 
over a number of years, provided he meets performance targets.

But he cannot even guarantee that the 
crisis – which has led to a backlog of 100 million transactions – will 
have been ironed out by the end of the week amid claims from insiders 
that the ‘priority incident’ is far from being resolved.

Customers called for him to resign and
accused RBS and its subsidiaries, NatWest and Ulster Bank, of 
repeatedly lying about fixing the computer fault which triggered the 
week of misery for the group’s 16.9million account holders.

In a day of dramatic developments:

As the crisis dragged into a second 
week, RBS insisted its computer systems were now ‘operating normally’, 
although it admitted there was still a backlog to clear.

But customers questioned how an 
apparently routine software update on Tuesday night could have brought 
millions of accounts to a standstill.

RBS has refused to offer a full 
explanation about what caused its computer systems to fail but has 
insisted the fault happened in Britain and was not caused by the 
outsourcing of operations to India.

However insiders have confirmed to 
the Mail that key support staff are based in Hyderabad where they are 
employed on salaries of up to £11,000 a year.

Internet scammers are trying to cash in on the NatWest crisis by conning customers into handing over their bank details.

E-mails claiming to be from the bank were being sent out within hours of the problems becoming public.

The scam emails - with the subject line: 'Important Information for Our Customers' - appear to take anyone who opens it to a NatWest site where it asks them to verify their accounts by entering their confidential login information.

Yesterday one NatWest customer revealed how she was almost duped into filling in the form as concern over the problems with the bank grew.

She said: ‘When I saw the email I opened it, and it was very realistic. Normally I ignore these emails because I know there are a lot of con artists out there, but with everything going on at NatWest, I almost fell for it.

‘Its despicable that criminals are trying to take advantage of what is, already, a very stressful time.’

NatWest warned customers on its website to ignore any communications on the internet which asked for details.

Anti-scam website Millersmiles monitors and reports on online confidence tricks and alerts the banks whose customers are being targeted. They said they first recorded the NatWest con late last week and the spoof website had been traced to Derby.

In a staff email seen by the Mail, RBS
admitted nightly ‘critical updates’ failed to run normally on Tuesday 
and Wednesday last week, meaning computer systems and customer balance 
information were not updated.

‘These updates bring all balance and transaction information in customer accounts up to date,’ said the email.

‘These processes failed to run in the 
normal times on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. The result is that our 
systems and customer balance information is not currently up to date.

‘In some circumstances customers have not been able to access payments into their accounts. This is a priority incident.’

The Financial Services Authority is 
expected to question what went wrong and Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of 
the Commons Treasury select committee, said MPs would also expect a 
‘full explanation’.

Lord Oakeshott, a former Liberal 
Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the crisis was the latest in a ‘series
of disasters’ to hit the bank, which has faced public criticism for its
failure to lend to small businesses since its taxpayer bail-out.

Earlier this year, its former chief executive Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood for his role in the bank’s failure.

Mr Hester took home more than 
£1.2million last year after he agreed to waive a £1.6million bonus 
following weeks of political pressure.

He could be in line for a share 
bonus of up to £2.4million this year, or £3million for exceptionally 
good performance, and is eligible for £7.9million in long-term incentive
awards, if he hits his targets.

Asked if RBS executives would receive 
bonuses this year, Mr Hester said: ‘Anyone who is thinking about 
bonuses, I’m afraid I have no patience for them.’

Lord Oakeshott said: ‘If Stephen 
Hester even thinks there’s any question of him getting a bonus this year
that just shows how out of touch he is with ordinary taxpayers and 
customers ... There is a very serious question whether he should still 
be in his job.’

Eddy Weatherill, of the Independent 
Banking Advisory Service, said: ‘The very basics of banking seem to have
eluded RBS. I feel there are no bonuses to be given here for any of the
top executive team.’

RBS is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer after a £2billion bailout following the 2008 financial crisis.

Mr Hester promised a ‘drains-up’ 
investigation into what had gone wrong and said senior management would 
face ‘proper accountability’, but refused to give a commitment that 
everything would be working normally by Friday.

He said: ‘I hope that the problems are
very substantially solved and as we go through the week we get through 
the backlog of complaints.’

Parent group RBS has said it will 
reimburse any customer for penalty charges or overdraft fees incurred 
because of the crisis, and will work to ensure credit ratings were not 
affected. But it is not clear whether account holders will be offered 
compensation for so-called consequential losses, such as property 
purchases falling through or being stranded abroad.

Shares in RBS fell three per cent 
yesterday and the group is expected to face a compensation bill for 
millions of pounds, coupled with overtime payments for staff who worked 
at the weekend.

City analysts said the total bill was likely to exceed £50million and could reach £100million.

RBS has persistently refused to reveal
how many of its 16.9million customers have been affected by the glitch.
But Ulster Bank said its total alone was 100,000.

Last night RBS sent an email to 
customers, saying it would increase credit card limits by £100 and waive
charges and cash advance fees. Some 1,200 branches will continue to 
open for extended hours, from 8am to 6pm until Friday.
