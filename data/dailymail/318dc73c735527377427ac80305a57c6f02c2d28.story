A 14-year-old rape victim was allegedly forced to strip at a police station to prove she was sexually assaulted.

It is alleged that when the teen arrived at the station in the Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh, she was asked to remove her clothes in front of a male police officer.

According to the Times of India, the teen said she was ordered to do so to convince him that her allegations of rape were genuine and not false.

Accusation: A police officer, pictured, allegedly asked a rape victim to removed her clothes to prove her claim was true when she reported the crime

The incident happened on Saturday when the teenager attended the police station with her parents to report that she had been raped by a local resident.

When the victim's father failed to pay a 50,000 rupee fee demanded by police on duty, officers refused to process her report.

The girl was then told to strip, it is claimed.

Following the family's complaint this week, the alleged rapist has reportedly been arrested.

The police officer accused of forcing the girl to strip is said to now be under investigation.

Rape and sexual assault remain a serious problem in the region.

According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, one woman is believed to be raped every 20 minutes in the country.

Sentence to death: Two of the men - Mukesh Singh, left and Vinay Sharma right - who have been sentenced to death by hanging for attacking a 23-year-old student in Delhi

In December, protests erupted across India after a young woman was brutally gang raped on a bus in New Delhi.

She died from internal injuries two weeks later.

Four men were sentenced to death by hanging for gang raping and torturing the 23-year-old victim earlier this month.

Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh are appealing against their death sentences.

Fury: Following the attack, hundreds took to the street in protest to demand swift justice in the case and wide-ranging reforms to sex crime laws
