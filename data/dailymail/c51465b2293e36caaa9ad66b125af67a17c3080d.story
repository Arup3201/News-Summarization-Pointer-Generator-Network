It was a classic David versus Goliath confrontation.

The odds were bleak for this tiny ant when it came across a mighty grasshopper on a plant in Indonesia.

But just as in the famous Biblical tale, size was no barrier to victory as the smaller creature got the better of its almighty - relatively speaking - counterpart.

The contrast in size is amazingly evident but this doesn't seem to intimidate this ant as he goes and takes a chunk out of the grasshopper. The pictures were taken in Indonesia

Its head almost resembling a duck, the ant gives the mighty hopper a nip. The incredible images were taken using a Canon EOS 5 D

Despite the larger insect's desperate kicks, the ant managed to bite the grasshopper and was then joined by eight of its ant friends who joined forces to subdue the green critter.

Photographer Adhi Prayoga took the pictures in a friend's garden.

He said: 'At first I thought the locust would be able to escape easily, but the strength of an ant is amazing despite having a small body.

'Ants also have a good togetherness and are very fast. When they attacked the locust was caught.'

The Indonesian father of three has been a photographer since early 2011 and enjoys specialising in insects.

He used a Canon EOS 5 D to capture the snaps, which took him roughly 30 minutes to shoot.

Despite
its suffering, the ordeal finished with a happy ending for the locust 
as it eventually managed to fight its way out of the ants' grasp.

The grasshopper tries to escape the grip of the tiny ant by scuttling towards the top of the plant - to no avail. When that fails, it tries to go the other way but danger is lurking from the ant's friends

This time the grasshopper tries to escape by running down the plant - but the ant will just not let go
