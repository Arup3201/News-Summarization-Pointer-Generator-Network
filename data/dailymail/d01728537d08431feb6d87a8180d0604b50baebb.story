Romelu Lukaku can become the best player in the world, according to Roberto Martinez.

The Belgian international completed a permanent switch to Everton for a club record £28million in the summer after a successful season on loan at the Goodison club.

The 21-year-old scored 15 Premier League goals during that loan spell, convincing Martinez to splash out the sizeable transfer fee for a player of relatively tender years.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez claims that Lukaku can become the best player in the world

Lukaku notched his fifth goal of the season during a 2-1 win against West Ham on Saturday and Everton boss Martinez is delighted with the striker's contribution to the team, claiming he has all the attributes to become the best player on the planet.

'He is someone that holds up the ball and brings a lot of fear to the opposition because they always get players around him which opens space at all times,' Martinez is quoted as saying in the Liverpool Echo.

'He's got power, he's got pace, he's a clinical footballer driving the ball – I've been delighted with Rom.

'I think he's doing exactly what the team needs. He's such a winner that he wants to become the best striker in the world and he's got the potential to do that.'

Marinez said that the 21-year-old striker's talents are unique to the Everton squad

Former Wigan and Swansea manager Martinez believes Lukaku's qualities – that are unique to the Everton squad – make him value for money, despite the huge outlay that dwarfed the previous transfer record of £15m for Marouane Fellaini back in 2008.

'Remember that the assessment of Rom is what he brings to the side. Nobody else in our squad can give us what he gives us,' Martinez added.

'The fee is what he means to our squad and you don't get that sort of player easy.' 

'The reality as well is that after the World Cup it's been difficult for him to get his best physical level and we need to help him towards that but I've been delighted with what he's done, although I still know he has loads to do because his potential is immense.
