Floyd Mayweather Jnr has threatened to sack his dad as his trainer after Floyd Snr suggested his son would fight Amir Khan and Manny Pacquiao.

The pound-for-pound megastar has two fights left on his six-fight deal with Showtime and insists he will retire next September.

But hopes that those last two bouts would be against long-time rival Pacquiao and British speedster Khan have been dashed.

‘Well my father is totally wrong,’ Mayweather told fighthype.com. ‘Like I said before, we have people constantly being removed from the Mayweather Promotions team, Team Mayweather, and we also have people being removed from The Money Team.

'I want my dad to be with my team, but if he continues to go out there and speak on things that he has no knowledge about without communicating with me, then I must get a new trainer.

'I couldn’t care less what Amir Khan say, just like I couldn’t care less what anybody say. I’m going to do what I want to do when I want to and how I want to.

Pacquiao will defend his WBO welterweight title against the American Chris Algieri on November 23

'I don’t know who I’m fighting next. I don’t even know if I’m fighting again. Like I told you, a lot of different crazy thoughts go through my mind every day.

'Sometimes I want to fight, sometimes I don’t want to fight. Listen, like I said before, he still got Danny Garcia problems just like Pacquiao still got [Juan Manuel] Marquez problems.’

Floyd Snr had earlier told the same website that a fight with Pacquiao was ‘going to happen’.

The undefeated champion displayed his considerable wealth on his  Instagram account earlier this week

He added: ‘It’s a fight for the world, man, right there. It’s the biggest fight that has ever been in life, so like I said, man, that fight’s gonna happen.’

Mayweather took his record to 47-0 last month with victory over Marcos Maidana in their Las Vegas rematch. Pacquiao, meanwhile, defends his WBO welterweight title against Chris Algieri in Macau on November 22.
