A New York bus driver claims he didn't hear a woman's heartwrenching screams as she was crushed to death beneath his bus on Thursday evening.

Horrified witnesses waved their hands yelling 'stop, stop, stop!' but the driver of the N6 Nassau Inter-County Express Bus turned the corner as though he saw and heard nothing.

Witnesses say that both the driver of the bus and the woman, 42, had a green light, but that the driver didn't stop for her to walk

Horrific crash: A New York bus driver claims he didn't hear a woman's heartwrenching screams as she was crushed to death beneath this bus on Thursday evening

The bus in Jamaica, Queens was turning right onto Hillside Avenue from 165th St. in an intersection that allows both pedestrians to walk and cars to turn the corner at the same time.

Those who observed the accident, both on the bus and on the street, were aghast and couldn't understand how the driver didn't notice the woman right in front of him.

'Oh my God!' cried the woman seconds before her death.

'I see the bus hit the lady and then the bus went 15 feet more,' said chauffeur Jose Valleo to The New York Daily News.

A passenger on the bus was able to observe the accident even though the driver wasn't.

'Everyone (on the bus) was screaming "Stop, stop, stop!" and he didn't stop until after the fact,' said passenger Dwayne Gray.

'I don’t understand how he couldn’t see her, that’s unbelievable. He didn’t even realize he hit somebody until afterwards,' Gray continued.

'I heard her scream.'

The woman was first rolled over by the front of the bus, barely missing the front tires.

Witnesses say had the driver stopped at the point the woman might still be alive but when the bus was turning the back wheels hit her, killing her.

'She got lucky the first time and went between the front wheels, but when the bus was turning, the back wheels hit her,' said a 15-year-old witness Tanvir.

Police say that the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver stayed at the scene of the crash and he was not immediately charged or ticketed.

The bus also hit a vehicle, causing damage to the car, the FDNY told NBC.

None of the passengers on the bus was injured.
