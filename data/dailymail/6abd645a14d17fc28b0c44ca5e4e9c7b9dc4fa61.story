The daughter of the Deep Throat film distributor has revealed what it was like growing up with the man who introduced Linda Lovelace to the world 

Kristin Battista-Frazee's father is Anthony Battista, who worked on the 1972 hardcore porn film.

But in interviews to promote her book, The Pornographer's Daughter, she says her childhood was not really affected by her father's career.

'My parents were like any other parents, they lived a pretty ... I say normally dysfunctional life, because eventually my parents did get divorced as so many parents did in the 1980s,' she told the Orlando Sentinel. 

'But my parents had the same concerns as any other parents. I felt like when I was living in my home, I didn't grow up any faster.' 

'People have this idea that I grew up watching adult films and hung out with strippers and stuff like that, but that's so wrong.'

Battista-Frazee, a marketing consultant in Washington, D.C, says her father simply saw the film as a way to make money for his family.

He was a W.E. Hutton stockbroker in Philadelphia, but began distributing the film as a side job.

Completed in less than a week, with all interior shots filmed in the same cheap Florida hotel room, the 61-minute Deep Throat cost $30,000 to make but earned an estimated $600 million - making it the most lucrative film ever made.

Opening in a single New York fleapit cinema, a few enthusiastic reviews and talk of ‘porno chic’ soon led to the film being a popular topic of conversation at the city’s more fashionable dinner parties. 

An attempted official clampdown only fuelled the frenzy to see it. 

Celebrities including Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and Truman Capote joined the queue, and Frank Sinatra held private screenings in his home for guests who reportedly included Sammy Davis Jr and Vice President Spiro Agnew. 

An estimated ten million Americans saw the film as the Mafia distributed it around the country, burning down cinemas when owners refused to hand over half their takings.

Appalled, the Nixon administration prosecuted the film’s makers for obscenity - including Battista - which the 44-year-old mother does admit affected her family life.

'My mom was open-minded and never had a problem with pornography,' she told the Sun Sentinel.

'But it was a rough road when the "Deep Throat" trials started. She feared my father would go to jail and wondered, "How am I going to survive this?"

Her mother attempted suicide and her mental health declined. Her father went on to open a string of sex shops. 

Battista-Frazee told the newspaper that she only just watched the film this year, saying: 'I actually didn't see it until this year, in September. I thought, "Well, I need to sit down and finally watch this." My first thought was that it didn't seem like such a big deal. It's not the best-made movie, but you have to give it credit for a catchy plot.'

Linda Lovelace - real name Linda Boreman - later told an official inquiry into the sex industry in 1986: ‘When you see the movie Deep Throat, you are watching me being raped,’ she baldly told an official inquiry into the sex industry in 1986.

‘It is a crime that movie is still showing. There was a gun to my head the entire time.’

But in an interview with Vice, Battista-Frazee said: 'I have talked to my father, and he didn’t believe she was forced.

'The gun to her head—I had heard from Eric Danville, author of The Complete Linda Lovelace—was figurative. It didn’t actually happen—that whole story got blown up into a myth. 

'She was in an abusive relationship, though—that is true—and her husband, Chuck, was an awful person.'
