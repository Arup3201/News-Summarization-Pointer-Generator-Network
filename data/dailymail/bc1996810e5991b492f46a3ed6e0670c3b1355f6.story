Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has warned that recent injury problems will not stop him having a World Cup to remember.

Van Persie has disappointed at recent major tournaments and heads in to tomorrow night’s opening Group B game defending champions Spain having recently suffered a groin problem and having escaped with minor cuts following a collision with a kite surfer on a Brazilian beach.

But the Old Trafford star claimed today he is ready to go, saying: 'I shouldn't even mention my groin injury, frankly.

'The last few days I have trained fully and I therefore have no more problems.

'I'm ready for it. Besides, I've been playing six years with aches. There is always something. I've had to learn to do that.

'I'm positive for everything that lies ahead and have faith in our team.'

The Dutch are preparing for their final games under coach Louis van Gaal before he leaves to join Van Persie as his new manager at United.

Playmaker Wesley Sneijder suggested this week that the Oranje are more together under Van Gaal than they were under Bert van Marwijk when they lost the last World Cup Final to Spain in 2010.

And Van Persie struck a similar note ahead of Holland’s official pre-match press conference later today.

He said: 'Do not underestimate us, even though Spain are a great team.

All smiles: Spain should beware according to van Persie who says he feels it will be a good tournament

'In my view they are the best team in the world. But we are also very good. Don't forget that.

'Of course, we have to prove ourselves again, but it is also a great challenge. We will therefore give it everything.

'Our focus is good and it has to be. What you saw in the past often, is that in the beginning, many jokes were being made. I think that's less the case now.

'We are looking forward to it and are really eager to get started.

'And if we - and I mean not only the players but also the staff and the press - can say that we've had a good tournament, whatever the outcome, that for us will be a success.'
