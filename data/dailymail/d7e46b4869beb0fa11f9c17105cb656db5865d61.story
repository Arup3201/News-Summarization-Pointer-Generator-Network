It was a bitter grudge match dubbed the Battle of the Bailout - and, unsurprisingly, it was dominated by Germany.

The German football team beat their Greek counterparts 4-2 in a quarter-final at Euro 2012 in Poland tonight.

The match in Gdansk, watched from the stands by German chancellor Angela Merkel, pitted Europe's economic engine room against the nation many say it is trying to crush, by demanding 
huge budget cuts in exchange for rescue cash.

And there was no respite for the Greeks as Germany, tipped as one of the favourites for the tournament, ran out comfortable winners.

Merkel has been regularly 
ridiculed by Greek media as a 'Nazi' trying to re-take control of their 
country.

It refers to Greece's occupation by 
Adolf Hitler's army from 1941 to 1945, for which some victims' families 
are still trying to claim $100billion from Berlin in reparations.

As
would be expected, both sets of national media spent the last week 
ramping up the tensions between the three-time champions and the 
surprise 2004 winners.

Greece's
Live newspaper quipped: 'The referee should give Merkel a fright and 
toss a drachma coin at the beginning of the match.'

Meanwhile,
Gata sports newspaper joked: 'The first measure that our new government
has to push through on the urging of Merkel: we have to lose against 
Germany on Friday.'

The German press has also drawn on the eurozone crisis.

Bild
newspaper said on Tuesday: 'Be happy dear Greeks, the defeat on Friday 
is a gift. Against Jogi Loew, no rescue fund will help you.'

Winner: Angela Merkel adjusts her glasses to get a better view of her team

Philipp Lahm gave Germany the lead in the 39th minute before Georgios Samaras equalized for Greece in the 55th.

But Sami Khedira, Miroslav Klose and Marco Reus all scored to pull Germany clear.

'We made some silly mistakes but at the end we scored four goals,' Lahm said. 'We had many chances in the first 10 to 15 minutes.'

Mrs Merkel stood to cheer every time her team scored in the match, which was played amid the political backdrop between the countries.

Germany has been a major contributor to economic bailouts for Greece and was instrumental in demanding unpopular spending cuts.

Germany dominated nearly the entire match at the Arena Gdansk, but the Greek defense held strong for much of the first half.

Lahm finally put his team in front by controlling the ball with his chest and dribbling toward the middle before sending a long-distance shot into the corner off the hand of Greece goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis.

The Greeks looked better at the start of the second half, and even equalized when Samaras knocked the ball past Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after a perfect cross from Dimitris Salpigidis.

But after that goal, it was back to being all Germany.

Khedira volleyed in a cross from Jerome Boateng in the 61st, and Klose headed in a free kick from Mesut Oezil in the 68th as Sifakis was late to punch the ball away. Reus made it 4-1 in the 74th, volleying a shot in off the underside of the crossbar after Sifakis had saved from Klose.

Salpigidis added a consolation penalty for Greece in the 89th after Boateng handled.

And Berliner Kurier printed a cartoon of a government spokesman telling German press: 'Our stance on you remaining in the eurozone depends entirely upon how the match goes.'

Twitter was predictably swamped with jokes and comments about the match.

@AndrewSimms_nef: 'Its Germany vs Greece in the Euro quarter finals. Odds-on Germany to impose penalties, at least Greece can grow their own half-time oranges.'

@iainmartin1: 'Presumably for Germany v Greece the German manager will be able to pick the Greek team and impose tactics?'

@bill_easterly: 'Greece at halftime of Euro match asks Germany for emergency loan of 4 players.'

Another added worry for Greece was that Merkel has a reputation as something of a lucky charm for her country's football team.

Merkel attended Germany's 4-0 win over Argentina at the 2010 World Cup and saw them beat Turkey in Berlin in the most important Euro 2012 qualifier for her team.

Already this year she's been to visit the player in the dressing room and at their base prior to the tournament's big kick-off. 'She seems to bring us luck,' midfielder Sami Khedira said.

The match was played in Gdansk, near the scene of the first battle of World War II as Nazi Germany invaded Poland.

A German football federation delegation laid a wreath at a memorial for Polish defenders at the Westerplatte peninsula on the outskirts of the Baltic city.

Germany has two Poland-born players in their squad, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski.

GREECE:

Population: 10.8million

GDP: 2% (down 5.5% from last year)

Unemployment: 22.6%

World Cup wins: 0

Euro Champs wins: 1

GERMANY:

Population: 81.8million

GDP: 27% (up 3% from last year)

Unemployment: 6.7%

World Cup wins: 3

Euro Champs wins: 3

By winning their group, Germany got to stay in Gdansk and will be spared the stress of travel.

Germany are the only team to have won all three group games and go into the quarter-finals as the overwhelming favorites.

But Greece were undeterred as midfielder Costas Katsouranis said: 'We are playing for our shirt, our flag and for the people back home.'

And striker Dimitris Salpigidis said: 'I don't think anyone on the team believes this will be our last game at this tournament.

'People have so many problems in their everyday lives. We're really hoping that we can put a smile on their face.'

Greece has plenty of reason to be thankful to Germany, as it was German Otto Rehhagel who led them to glory eight years ago.

Greece will be missing suspended playmaker and captain Giorgos Karagounis, but defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos, one of the many players with Bundesliga experience, said the team had nothing to lose.
