One of the most prestigious five star hotels in Britain has been hit by smash and grab robbers for the second time in four weeks.

A gang of six men on three mopeds pulled up outside the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair, central London, in the early hours of this morning before three of them smashed their way through the front door and broke into display cabinets.

The luxury venue was hit in exactly the same way last month, when watches and jewellery were stolen in what police called a 'well-planned' heist.

In today's robbery, the thieves all fled the scene within minutes and no one has yet been arrested.

Detective Sergeant Mark Staples said: 'We continue work towards establishing those responsible for carrying out not only the robbery which took place in the early hours of this morning but the robbery which took place last month.

'We have yet to make arrests in relation to either incident and we urgently require the support of the public with providing us with any information no matter how small.

'There may be people who know who is responsible and I am keen for those with any information to come forward and assist us with our investigation.'

Police have yet to reveal the value of items stolen but it is thought it could run into many thousands of pounds.

A guest at the hotel on Park Lane, said: 'I woke up early, so I went down to the lobby at about five, maybe six in the morning.

'There was quite a bit off commotion. Police were there and speaking to the staff and it looked as if a few things had been smashed.'

During the first raid in June, three of the gang were spotted waiting outside the hotel on their bikes

She added: 'Apparently, one of the doors had been smashed but it was being cleared up and their was a screen around it.

'We
 had been told that there was an incident, but nobody was hurt and the 
police had it under control. But I spoke to another guest who said the 
people who smashed it were driving mopeds, or motorbikes.'

A spokeswoman for the hotel said: 'We can confirm there was an incident at the hotel early this morning and we are assisting the authorities with their inquiries.

'The hotel security team were quick to respond and no-one was hurt. The comfort and security of our guests and staff is our top priority.'

On June 10, a gang of six men pulled up on three mopeds outside hotel at around 1.30am.

On that occasion, they smashed five glass display cases in the foyer and stole watches and jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds.

As the gang escaped last month, one of the bikes hit a 25-year-old woman in nearby Cambridge Circus, leaving her with leg injuries that required hospital treatment.
