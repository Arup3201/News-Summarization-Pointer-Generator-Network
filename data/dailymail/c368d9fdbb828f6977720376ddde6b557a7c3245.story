A former model, who claims tarot cards saved her life by predicting a flat fire, is suing the owners of the restaurant where it began for £300,000.

Sally-Anne Jones, who lived above the restaurant, said she was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and suffered burns to her face as she escaped the fire on New Year's Day 2010.

Miss Jones, 40, said she only survived the fire because a celebrity tarot reader had told her to be prepared for danger two weeks before the blaze that destroyed all her possessions.

The socialite, who previously partied with the likes of Katie Price and Richard Branson, said she picked the tower card, which symbolise failure, ruin or catastrophe during the reading.

Miss Jones, who now lives in Chelsea, west London, is suing Fate Limited, which own the Little Bay restaurant in York Road, Battersea, for injury, loss and damage.

In papers filed to the High Court, her solicitors claim 'the traumatic experience' has left her with psychiatric problems, including panic attacks.

She told The Evening Standard said: 'I was moving in circles with some big names and some quite important people before this happened.

'I don't feel in any fit state to make decisions in my life.

'It feels as if I have had a personality transplant. Some part of me has gone.'

Before the fire, which gutted the restaurant and eight flats above, Miss Jones said tarot reader Valentin Borissov had told her the cards would not make sense after the reading but 'will in time'.

She credited the 'premonition' with helping her to keep calm as the fire spread.

The papers said she almost jumped from the window of her flat but instead fled the burning building through acrid smoke down the stairs.

The claim said she suffered smoke inhalation and coughed up black spit for weeks after the blaze.

She also sustained superficial burns to her face and had recurrent chest infections, blurred vision and did not physically recover for six months, according to the papers.

The claim also states she has suffered nightmares, flashbacks, confusion and impaired decision making since the fire.

She also blames the distress on the breakdown of her relationship with her fiance and father of her child.

The papers state that the restaurant's insurers had made an admission of liability 'subject to causation being proven.'

In a statement Peter Illic, who owns the restaurant, said: 'The matter is being dealt with by Fate Ltd's representatives who are in negotiations with Miss Jones's solictors in relation to her claim.'
