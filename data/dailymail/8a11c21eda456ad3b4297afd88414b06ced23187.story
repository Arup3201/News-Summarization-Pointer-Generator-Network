One of the world's most wanted Nazis who sent more than 140,000 European Jews to the gas chambers was secretly employed by Syria as an agent of terror, declassified US files show.

Alois Brunner, the right-hand man of leading Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann, is believed to have served as an adviser to then President Hafez al-Assad.

Secret CIA documents have revealed he gave advice about torture techniques to the regime and instructed Kurdish separatists on how to stage attacks in Turkey.

French investigators believe he fled to Syria in 1954, where he was protected by successive regimes, but they lost track of him in 1992 in Damascus.

When questioned, former President Assad, who led Syria from 1971 to 2000, denied knowing the Nazi war criminal.

William L Eagleton, the US ambassador to Damascus wrote to the US Secretary of State George Schultz in 1984 saying: 'Brunner is known to be protected in Syria by armed guards, presumably from the Syrian intelligence services.'

'In the past, our source [in the West German embassy] said Brunner has done work on behalf of the Syrian intelligence services in training Kurdish guerrillas who operate from Syria against Turkey.'

Brunner has frequently been described as the 'right hand man' of Adolf Eichmann, pictured during his trial in Israel in 1962, the architect of the Holocaust

The Nazi war criminal sent more than 140,000 European Jews to the gas chambers before fleeing 

Efraim Zuroff, director of Nazi hunting group the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, reported that Brunner died four years ago at the age of 98.

'He was a sadist; a fanatical Nazi,' said Mr Zuroff.

'He told a German magazine in 1985: "My only regret is that I didn't murder more Jews".'

But French lawyer Serge Klarsfeld has disputed these claims, saying he would not have survived that long because of ill health. 

'We know that in 1992, he was taken out of his apartment in an ambulance. He was in very bad health at that time so I don't see him having lived until 2010,' he told AFP. 

In 1988 the West German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, raised Brunner with President Assad, who denied knowing of him.

'Damascus is too embarrassed to admit his presence and has a perverse sense of pride which would prohibit turning the former Nazi over to any western authority, since this would be perceived locally as giving in to Israeli pressures,' the US embassy recorded. 

Brunner's file ends with an erroneous report that he died in 1961 after opening a letter bomb. 

It was the year that Eichmann was put on trial after being captured by Mossad and requests to Syria to provide Brunner as a witness were ignored.   

Syria has repeatedly denied harbouring the war criminal, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in his absence by a French court in 2001.

Born in Austria in 1912, Brunner rose in rank within the SS and worked as the assistant of Adolf Eichmann.

Eichmann was 'the brains' behind the Holocaust and Hitler's Final Solution. Eichmann also fled after the war, but was captured in Argentina by Mossad, the Israeli secret service, tried in Israel and executed in 1962.
