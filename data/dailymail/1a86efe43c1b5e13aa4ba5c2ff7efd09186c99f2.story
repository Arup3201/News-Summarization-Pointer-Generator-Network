Age-defying cream specialists Olay have once more ranked first on a list of the world's most valuable 
cosmetic brands, beating L'Oreal, Neutrogena and Nivea to the top of the
leader board.

The beauty favourite, of whom Thandie Newton is their current celebrity 'face', held 
their position on the Brand Finance Cosmetics 50 table with a value of 
£7.64billion.

This is despite the Procter & Gamble-owned brand's lead having dropped from £2.61billion to £1.96 billion, following the growth of French brand L'Oreal.

Olay beat all other cosmetics brands to the top of the Brand Finance table

L'Oreal has continued its 
progression up the rankings, having moved from fourth to third last year, it 
is now second. Brand value growth of £621 million, more than any other 
brand, means its total brand value is now £5.7 billion.

Brand Finance, the leading global 
brand valuation and marketing experts, calculate their annual list of 
the top 50 most valuable cosmetics brands using the 'Royalty Relief approach': brand value is essentially the cost that a third party would have to pay to license the use of a brand.

According to Brand Finance, L'Oréal's 
success hinges on shrewd exploitation of its French heritage. France's 
nation brand is synonymous with luxury, helping to drive £17billion 
worth of luxury goods exports in 2012.

The brand, whose 'face' is currently Cheryl Cole, has contributed to this 
trend, targeting emerging markets such as Brazil and China to achieve 
revenue growth of 12 per cent last year.

The results table detailing the most valuable cosmetics brands

L'Oréal is followed in the 
Brand Finance Cosmetics 50 by Neutrogena, Nivea and Lancôme, which have all recovered well from brand value 
falls last year.

Sixth-placed Avon is this year's biggest casualty. Down 
from second last year, it has lost £1.76billion of brand value this year.

The £1.5billion lost last year means Avon's brand value is down £3.26billion on 2011 and now stands at just £3.4billion.

The particularly
dramatic brand value falls suggest low levels of investor confidence 
following a revenue drop of five per cent and a loss of £27.7million in 2012.

Commenting on the results, 
Mary-Ellen Field, Chairman of Brand Finance Australia stated: 'The global
beauty industry continues to do, well, beautifully.

'With the increasing
wealth of women in developing economies we have not surprisingly seen 
the sales of beauty products in these countries growing.

'Cosmetic halls 
in department stores throughout the world continue to be exciting places
despite growing competition from Internet sales.'
