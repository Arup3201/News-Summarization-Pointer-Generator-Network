A 24-year-old man was arrested at Heathrow Airport on Monday morning on suspicion of committing or planning terrorism offences.

He was detained by officers from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command after arriving on a flight from Bahrain.

It is suspected the arrest was made in relation to attempts to prevent people joining up with Syrian rebels and then returning to Britain with honed terrorism skills.

The man was taken to a south London police station where he is being questioned over alleged terrorist activity.

A police spokesman said: 'Officers from the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) Counter Terrorism Command today, Monday November 12, arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, under the Terrorism Act 2000.

'He was arrested at 8.45am after arriving on a flight from Bahrain to Heathrow Airport.

'The man was arrested after initially being stopped by immigration officials at 8am.'

He added: 'Today's arrest forms part of an investigation into travel to Syria in support of alleged terrorist activity.'

Another man, Shajul Islam, 26, a trainee NHS doctor, has been charged with keeping a British and a Dutch journalist captive.

Islam, who studied at St Bartholomew's and a University of London hospital, is accused of being part of an extremist group that held John Cantlie, who worked for various newspapers including the Sunday Times, and Jeroen Oerlemans for around a week in the war-torn state.

Islam, from Stratford, east London, was arrested at Heathrow Airport last month as he arrived back in the UK with his wife and one-year-old daughter on a flight from Egypt.

He is accused of being a doctor for the jihadi group that kidnapped the journalists and held them at a camp in Syria.

Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans were kept handcuffed and blindfolded after being captured as they travelled into Syria to cover the conflict there.

It is alleged that Islam, with others, unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans against their will, between July 17 and 26.

Islam is due to appear at the Old Bailey on April 12 for a plea and case management hearing, and a six-week trial is set to begin on June 5.

Scores of extremists, some newly converted to Islam, have been heading off to the Middle East and MI5 and counter-terrorism police units are using anti-terror powers to disrupt their travel plans.

The civil war is largely seen as a fight between the Free Syrian Army and the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad.

However, Western governments are increasingly worried that it is being hijacked by jihadist groups inspired by Al Qaeda ideologies.

A small number of British Muslims have already been detained and questioned over concerns they intend to join extremist brigades fighting with the rebels.

One security source warned in: ‘There is an increasing number of Muslims going to Syria but they are becoming difficult to monitor because the disguise their ultimate destination by first travelling to France before flying on to Turkey and Jordan.

'The question is when they return to the UK do they carry on their lives peacefully, happy to have done their bit for jihad, or do they bring jihad back to Britain?’

The source added: ‘Some have the will to carry out attacks and by the time  they return they also have capacity to make bombs  and fire guns. This is a concern that needs to be closely monitored.’

Unlike the Libyan conflict, the Syria volunteers are  not refugees from their home country and counter-terrorism agencies fear that once the war is over, these trained fighters will look for a new jihadist cause.

There are up to 100 British fighters in Syria, and some of Pakistani origin have been identified in the forefront of foreign brigades.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
