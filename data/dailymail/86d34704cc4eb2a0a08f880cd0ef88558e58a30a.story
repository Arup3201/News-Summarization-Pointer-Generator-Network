The anti-government protestors in Russia have been caught up in a scandal that seems designed to split them after secret recordings of private phonecalls in which they attacked each other were posted on a pro-government website.

In an echo of KGB-era surveillance, six hours worth of calls from opposition leader Boris Nemtsov were leaked to the website www.lifenews.ru.

The website is part-owned by Yuri Kovalchuk, an ally of Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media.

Opposition activists: Evgenia Chirikova (left) was insulted by Boris Nemtsov (right) of the People's Freedom Party - their differences over protest tactics were made public in six hours of secretly-recorded phonecalls

Angered: Nemtsov wanted to organise Government sanctioned protests, which led Chirikova to say he was in liege with the State

The biggest protests of Putin's 12-year rule, expressing anger at the debated election results which re-installed him as Prime Minister, were split into two camps.

One group, led by Nemtsov, advocated a legal protest that had been negotiated with the Russian Government.

Another group, led by Yevgeniya Chirikova, 35, wanted to organise a protest in front of the Kremlin, without Government permission.

Nemtsov believed that a legal protest would swell the ranks, with the addition of white-collar protestors who feared police clashes in an unsanctioned event.

Chirikova said that Nemtsov must in cahoots with the Government.

And according to the recordings Nemtsov called her 'either a bitch, or an idiot'.

Thowing a curveball? Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, shown here at a school gym Cheryomushki, Siberia, is an ally of the owner of the website - www.lifenews.ru - which published the calls

Man of action: Putin hummers a 'golden' spike to start a construction of a new railway near the city of Kyzyl in Siberia, on another of his legendary publicity drives

In the secretly recorded phonecalls Nemtsov apparently said of Chirikova: 'She is a f***** but what the hell can I do about it? She doesn’t f****** listen.'

'You are a f****** great Russian writer for f**** sake. Can you call that Chirikova and tell that bitch that you are insulting Nemtsov by accusing him of working for money. That bloody beast.'

In other comments, Nemtsov derided supporters he was trying to muster for a rally as 'office plankton - chemical internet types' who had never seen a riot policeman in their lives.         

Nemtsov, a former cabinet minister who was once tipped as possible Kremlin leader during the rule of Boris Yeltsin, said the recordings had been heavily edited and partly falsified in an attempt by Putin’s supporters to splinter the opposition.

'Parts of the recordings are genuine, part are heavily edited and parts are simply fake and falsified,' said Nemtsov.

Nemtsov said the publication was an attempt by Putin and Kremlin acting chief of staff Vladislav Surkov to undermine a day of mass protests planned across Russia on December 24.    

Electoral anger: The ongoing protests have been the biggest under the varying reigns of Putin and there is another major event planned for December 24

Tactical disagreement: Nemtsov's position was, he said, designed to attract to the protests white-collar workers who were afraid of being manhandled by police in an unsanctioned demonstration

'The aim of Putin and Surkov is to prevent a mass meeting on the 24th and to split the opposition,' he said.

'They will not succeed: it will have the opposite effect and more people will come out.'     

Surkov's office did not return a call for comment.          

A spokesman for Kovalchuk’s Bank Rossiya refused to say if there were any links between Kovalchuk and Lifenews, requesting written questions. Lifenews said it did not know of any links with Kovalchuk, who Forbes says has a net worth of $1.5 billion.    

Nemtsov said he had offered his apologies to Chirikova for his comments but that the publication had contravened his rights as a Russian citizen and his lawyers were working on getting a criminal case opened.   

In Russia, only state security services or their commercial cousins have the resources to carry out such extensive 'phone hacking' so the recordings may also indicate the enduring influence of the secret police in Russian politics.

Russia's secret police have long meddled in Moscow politics, even coining the Russian word 'kompromat' - or compromising material - to describe potentially damaging information used for blackmail.   

While Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in 1999, the security services were suspected of having a hand in the airing of a video purporting to show Russia's top prosecutor cavorting in bed with two women.             

Lifenews, which has delivered scoops such as the January 24 suicide bombing at Russia's biggest airport by building close contacts with the law enforcement agencies, did not say where it had got the recordings.           

Ashot Gabrelyanov, the 22-year-old chief executive of News Media which owns Lifenews, refused to say if he had got the recordings from the security services.   

'You as a reporter yourself know I cannot disclose my sources,' he said by telephone.           

'The cynicism of the opposition leaders is 10 on the Richter scale,' Gabrelyanov said on his twitter account.

'Dudes, in five years in show business I have never heard such an outrage.'                

He said he would publish more recordings.
