A creative cook has made the leap from kitchen experiment to culinary business with his idea of a chocolate filled samosa and is now selling them to the supermarket chain Morrisons.

Ajay Kainth wanted to add a new twist to the traditional Asian pastries so started experimenting with flavours.

His Chocomosas come in three rather tempting tastes - chocolate and nuts, coconut and chocolate and peanut butter and chocolate.

Ajay said: 'I like experimenting with new things and one day I made up the recipe and it worked.

'I know of a few Indian-style restaurants that make them but I am the first person to retail them to the public.

'Samosas sell all-year round but I wanted to create something unique and with a twist that will make my brand stand out and bring the outdated look of Asian food and packaging into the modern world.'

Ajay, 30, developed the idea in the kitchen of his family home in Woodford Green, North East London, when he was growing up.

Bored of making traditional-style samosas, Mr Kainth filled the pastry with chocolate and other accompanying ingredients and watched his family devour them with delight.

After trying several professions, including a spell at university studying engineering, he developed the Samosa under his brand name, Fresh off the Boat (FOB) Foods, in June last year.

He then marketed the frozen product at the Halal Food Festival at London’s Excel in September 2013 and drew the attention of a buyer from the country’s fourth largest supermarket chain, Morrisons.

Noor Ali, world food buyer at Morrisons, said: 'We have worked hard to ensure our world food offering strongly reflects the needs of those communities local to our stores across the UK.

'We are delighted to be able to offer Chocomosas to our customers.'

As of last month, the product is now stocked in 50 branches.

Mr Kainth’s younger sister, Natasha, 26, described the product as the next big thing since the cupcake ‘craze’.

She said: 'The cupcake business is dying out, so this is something new, original and exciting.'

Mr Kainth is set to expand his range of fillings to include different flavours such as fruit fillings in the coming 12 months.
