Claim: Supporters of Mayor Lutfur Rahman allegedly handed out lollipops to the children of voters

Voters were promised council houses if they re-elected their mayor, a court heard yesterday.

Islamic sections of the electorate were told they should be ‘good Muslims’ by voting for Mayor Lutfur Rahman, it was said.

In a further bid to win votes, supporters of Mr Rahman allegedly handed out lollipops to the children of voters in Tower Hamlets, East London.

A petition brought before the High Court claims the re-election of the mayor in May was fraudulent ‘in a variety of forms’.

It alleges that council officers were bullied into ‘securing a certain number of votes’ and were threatened with the sack if they refused.

Votes were cast in the names of people who were not ‘entitled to be on the electoral register’ and numerous postal ballots were filled in by the same person, the court heard.

And false allegations that rival candidate John Biggs was a racist and anti-Islamic were circulated.

Mr Rahman, who is serving a second term as the mayor of the borough, won by some 3,000 votes.

The petition, brought by residents Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussain and Angela Moffat, claims that supporters of the mayor descended on 41 polling stations at night, ‘making it difficult or impossible for voters to get into the stations’.

The men were ‘telling voters that they must vote for Mayor Rahman in an intimidating manner’, the petition claims. 

The statement also cited concerns ‘that polling station officials folded the ballot papers in such a way to obscure one of the candidates’.

James Laddie QC, acting for Mr Rahman, said his client denied all the allegations. He asked Mr Justice Supperstone and Mr Justice Spencer to dismiss the petition.

The four petitioners are seeking a trial date so that their petition can be heard in full. The hearing continues.
