The tourist: Dennis DeJesus, 45, a logistics specialist from Florida, has been arrested on a federal charge of traveling to engage in illicit sexual activity

A Florida man has been arrested on suspicion that he made several trips to South America to have sex with underage girls and make child pornography involving masks and costumes.

Dennis DeJesus, an unmarried 45-year-old logistics specialist from North Lauderdale, was arrested last Saturday on a federal charge of child sex tourism as part of an international sting operation, which also netted 11 Colombian suspects.

According to the US Department of Homeland Security, federal agents rescued 55 children, some as young as 11 years old, who allegedly were forced to work as prostitutes, Sun-Sentinel reported.

Some of the victims said they had been plied with cocaine and ecstasy before sexual encounters.

According to police, Dennis DeJesus traveled to the Colombian cities of Bogota and Medellin several times over the past year for the purpose of having sex with underage prostitutes.

The portly, bespectacled Floridian caught the attention of federal officials last month when they received a tip about his alleged involvement in 'sex tourism.'

An undercover agent identified in court records as 'Todd' befriended DeJesus on Facebook, and before long the two were making plans for a joint sex-capade in Colombia.

Communicating via instant messenger, DeJesus and his new 'friend’ talked about the prospect of having sex with 'fresh' girls - a code phrase they had agreed upon to signify a prostitute under the age of 18.

Court records state that in September, DeJesus reached out to the undercover agent telling him that he knew a 'fresh' sex worker who charged $300 'for the whole night.'

The 45-year-old North Lauderdale resident also confided in his Facebook friend that he had picked up props for their upcoming trip: costumes, masks, silk gloves and lingerie for the girls to wear in his homemade porn videos.

DeJesus also allegedly revealed that he cataloged all his teen lovers in his phone, complete with each girl’s name and picture.

When federal agents searched DeJesus' home in the 7800 block of Southwest Fourth Place, they allegedly discovered two X-rated videos and one photograph depicting an underage girl performing oral sex on a man.

Officials also came upon a stash of lingerie, costumes and masks.

DeJesus, a native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, told federal investigators that he has been making bi-annual trips to Colombia since 2007 to visit friends, but he denied hiring underage prostitutes.

The 45-year-old did admit, however, that he has talked to young girls online and was tempted to have sex with them.

Addressing the presence of costumes intended for young girls in his house, DeJesus said he was planning to take them to Colombia as Halloween presents for his friends’ children.

So far, the suspect has been charged with a single count of traveling to engage in illicit sexual activity with another person, but prosecutors say they expect to file additional charges against DeJesus.

About 35,000 underage boys and girls are involved in child prostitution in Colombia, according to the Colombian Family Welfare Institute.
