Support for a huge, $1.1 trillion spending bill funding every corner of government, faded Wednesday as liberal lawmakers erupted over a provision that weakens the regulation of risky financial instruments and another that allows more money to flood into political parties.

At the same time, conservatives remain unhappy that the bill fails to bar President Barack Obama's immigration actions, and a key conservative grassroots organization lobbied its allies on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to vote against the legislation.

The measure also took a blow when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement demanding that the changes to 2010 Dodd-Frank regulation of complex financial instruments known as derivatives and a provision sharply hiking limits on donations to political parties be taken out of the bill.

Her support, and the votes of her Democratic colleagues, is crucial to passing the measure, as are the votes of Tea Party Republicans who feel their being shafted by GOP leadership in the House.

House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday following a House GOP caucus meeting that Republicans and Democrats had agreed on a $1.1 trillion spending bill to avoid a government shutdown and delay a politically-charged struggle over President Barack Obama's new immigration policy until the new year

A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said the provisions were part of bipartisan trade-offs and said they would remain in the bill.

The 1,603-page measure was unveiled late Tuesday and its provisions will be scrutinized in advance of a House vote Thursday.  

The House plans to vote first on a three-day extension of the current continuing resolution the government is operating on to give the Senate and the president time to act on the broader legislation. 

The government will otherwise shut down tomorrow at the stroke of Midnight, less than 24 hours before Congress plans to recess until next year.

The White House said on Wednesday morning that it hadn't read the entire omnibus bill, but it was generally 'pleased' with the provisions it had reviewed. 

Still, the spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would not commit the president to approving the legislation if it arrives on his desk.

'I'm confident there are gonna be some things in here...that we're not gonna like, and we'll have to sort of consider the whole package before we make a decision about whether or not to sign it,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.

It's unclear how shaky the bipartisan coalition backing the omnibus bill is, but the alternative is to keep the government running on autopilot until Republicans seize full control of Congress next year or allow it to undergo it second shutdown in 14 months. 

Nonetheless, top Democrats were lining up to vote against the measure on Wednesday.

'I'm not going to support it. I've already found lots of provisions that are against the public interest,' Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen said. 

'I find it surprising that some people are threatening to shut down the government in order to extract big benefits for big banks at the expense of consumers and taxpayers,' he said.

Conservatives were angry, too, and Heritage Action, the grassroots arm of leading conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, came out against the measure today.

'Why in the world would we want to lock in federal spending through next September that reflects the priorities of the Democratic Senate that voters just thoroughly repudiated last month?' California Rep. Tom McClintock said.

'Why in the world would we want to so greatly weaken our position to insist on the complete defunding of the president's unconstitutional act [on immigration] in the next session of Congress?'

Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, pictured above at a press conference on Capitol Hill today, and conservatives defected on voting for the spending bill today, putting a  government shutdown back in play if Congress doesn't at least pass an extension to the current continuing resolution the government is operating off of by the stroke of Midnight tomorrow

The compromise spending bill would permit virtually the entire government to operate normally through the Sept. 30, 2015, the end of the fiscal year, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security.

Funds for that one agency will run out again on Feb. 27, when Republicans are expected to try to use the expiration as leverage to force Obama to roll back a decision suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally, while providing work permits and eventually making them eligible for benefit programs such as Social Security and Medicare. 

Boehner told fellow Republicans at a Wednesday morning party meeting that the immigration 'fight will be done at the end of February when the troops, when the cavalry comes,' a reference to the upcoming GOP takeover of the Senate. 

The White House said today that even then it doesn't believe that GOP leaders will follow through on their promise to conservatives to stick it to Obama by adding language to a DHS funding bill that would block Obama's actions. 

'I would be surprised if Republicans take the position that they are going to withhold funding from border security, from people conducting criminal background checks, from other elements of our federal government that are critical to Homeland Security just in protest over the president taking an executive action,' Obama's spokesman told reporters today.

A GOP staffer familiar with the conservative strategy told MailOnline last month, however, that border patrol and other critical  enforcement agencies in DHS would be deemed essential if it underwent a partial shutdown and would therefore remain open.

That understanding has fueled conservatives lawmakers' willingness to hold funds for the department hostage until Obama relents and signs legislation barring his own executive actions on immigration.

They would prefer, however, if the entire federal government were funded for only the first two months of the new year so that Congress has more leverage over the president when it comes time to renegotiate an appropriations package.

Their irritation with the current package was further exacerbated when they learned that it contained  $948 million for the Unaccompanied Alien Children program - an $80 million increase from the fiscal year before.

That money will go toward making sure the Health and Human Services Department has enough money in the upcoming year to feed and house illegal immigrant children who travel to the U.S. from Central America, as they are required do by law, until they are turned over to the proper authorities.

Conservatives are unhappy about the increased allocation for HHS because a bill the House passed over the summer hinged additional resources on the inclusion of language tying Obama's' hands on immigration. 

Now, they say, the Obama administration will get the money it requested and it will have no incentive to act in ways that decrease the stream of unaccompanied minors showing up at the U.S. border with Mexico seeking amnesty.

The omnibus bill directs significantly less money to HHS overall than the earlier legislation, House leadership has pointed out, and substantially fewer dollars were allotted to the effort than the the president asked for.

The compromise legislation adheres to tight budget caps negotiated previously between the White House and Republicans, freezing agency budgets, on average. 

It also includes several provisions to fulfill Republican policy objectives, including significantly weakening new regulations that require banks to set up separate affiliates to deal in the more exotic and riskier forms of complex financial instruments called swaps.

But some top Democrats, including Appropriations Committee member Nita Lowey of New York, supported the provision, and party leaders didn't appear to try too hard to knock it out.

The measure is laced with trade-offs. Democrats won budget increases for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; Republicans won a big cut to the Internal Revenue Service budget and a smaller cut to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Democrats blocked the most ambitious attempts by Republicans to thwart Obama administration regulations on greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming, and on clean water; Republicans won a new concession exempting many agricultural projects from clean water rules and an old one boosting exports of coal mine equipment.

GOP leaders distributed a lengthy roster claiming wins on spending cuts and policy and claimed significant support among the rank and file.

'I think we won on policy, the budget numbers are lower than I ever thought it would be,' Rep. Richard Hudson said.

The overall spending measure touches every part of government, from a provision to ease standards on school meals that were supposed to go into effect in 2017 to funds to restore the iconic Capitol Dome.

Proponents of campaign finance reforms decried a provision slipped in at the last minute that would sharply increase limits on the amount that an individual may contribute to various national political party accounts each year. 

Those limits would rise from $32,400 to $324,000 for donations to finance parties' national conventions, election recounts and headquarters buildings. That means individuals could give $648,000 in a two-year campaign cycle, with a married couple capped at almost $1.3 million for an election cycle.

'It is only millionaires and billionaires who can give these huge, corrupting contributions,' said campaign finance activist Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21.

Another provision drawing fire would allow pensions to be cut for current retirees covered by some economically-distressed multiemployer plans, part of a package agreed to unexpectedly Tuesday after secretive talks.
