A nine-year-old boy wearing only pajamas and no shoes fled to his Minnesota school as his step mom allegedly chased him yelling 'I'm going to kill you'.

The child, who has not been named, ran into Dayton's Bluff Achievement Plus Elementary where teachers found him hysterically crying on Wednesday around 3.40pm, according to the criminal complaint.

Shortly after, the  principal told police his step-mom, Tashay Caprice Johnson, 24, came running into the school.

Johnson, 24, was arrested following the incident and charged with making terroristic threats and malicious punishment of a child

The boy claimed Johnson hit him on the head with a baseball bat, struck him in the face with her fist and also hit him in the arm with a belt before telling him she was going to grab a gun and kill him.

Johnson was arrested and faces up to five years in prison if convicted of both charges including making terroristic threats and malicious punishment of a child.

Police said they found injuries that matched the trauma the boy described including swelling on the left side of his head and marks on his left arm that appeared to be from a belt, according to 11Alive.

They also found scratches near his left eye and the right side of his neck.

While officers were speaking to Johnson at her home, they later found the baseball bat and arrested her.

On Wednesday after the boy ran into the school, the principal blocked Johnson from entering until they could piece together what had transpired.

The boy told police earlier that day his teacher had walked him home so that she could talk to his parents about his behavioral problems at school.

Once the teacher left their home, that is when he said Johnson told him he was going to get a 'whooping'.

After she allegedly hit him and said she was going to get the gun, he fled from home.

Johnson denied assaulting the boy or threatening to kill him, and she did not know how he got the belt marks on his arm, according to Twin Cities.

She told police that after the teacher left their home, she spoke to the child's father and they both decided to have him sit in the corner as punishment, but he ran around the house instead, the complaint said.

Following Johnson's arrest, the boy's father jumped and said 'I whoop that kid but it doesn't do any good'.

If she is convicted of the charges, Johnson faces  $10,000 in fines for the terroristic threat charge and $3,000 in fines for the malicious punishment charge, according to KSTP.
