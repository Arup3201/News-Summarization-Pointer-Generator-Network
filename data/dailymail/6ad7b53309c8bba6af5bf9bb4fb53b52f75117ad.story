Disturbing: Customs officials count 213 bear paws which were seized after two Russian men attempted to smuggle them into China

They were discovered hidden inside the tyres of a vehicle which was crossing the border from Russia.

According to the Global Times, it is believed the paws are from the brown bear, which is a protected species in China.

Bear parts are in demand in China because people believe they have a medicinal value. Experts say smuggling like this has increased in the last two years.

As reported by the BBC, in China bear paws are worth 10 times more than in Russia. It is estimated the haul was worth Â£293,000.

Illegal: Bear parts are in demand in China because people believe they have a medicinal value

Speaking to the Global Times, Zhang Xiaohai, from the Animals Asia Foundation, said: 'The
demand is huge because more people can afford them and the country has 
the tradition to treat bear paw as a rare ingredient for cuisine or as 
an expensive present,' he said.

'Bear farms in China exacerbate the situation as they also sell paws illegally, which stimulates the growing trade.'

Officials at the border became suspicious after noticing one of the men driving a van looked nervous and appeared to keep checking his watch on May 22.

Officials decided to X-ray the van and they discovered the paws.
