North Korean leader Kim Jong-un led a drill and taught the captain of a submarine how to navigate as he visited a navy unit, it has been reported.

The dictator visited the North Korean Navy Unit 167, where he reportedly spoke of the importance of the country's submarine units.

Pictures released by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, show the leader riding on top of the submarine as it remained above water and being shown around the inside of the vessel.

The paper said Kim called for the crew on the submarine to 'devote their wisdom and enthusiasm to rounding off the combat preparations'.

The dictator also reportedly led a navy drill and even taught 'navigation methods' to the submarine's captain, according to the Korean Central News Agency, as cited by the South's Yonhap News Agency.

He said: 'The Party Central Committee is attaching great importance to the combined units of submarines.'

Patches of rust can be seen in the pictures of the green vessel, which Yonhap said is believed to be part of the South Hamgyong Province-based East Sea fleet command.

That the pictures would reveal the submarine to be in such a condition has surprised North Korea expert Aidan Foster-Carter.

He told The Telegraph: 'To see rust in a North Korean picture is quite surprising. Normally they tart stuff up.'

According to the KCNA, during the visit to the submarine the dictator 
said: 'The commanding officers and seamen should clearly see through the
 motives of the hateful enemies watching for a chance to invade our land
 and put spurs to combat preparations, thinking about battles only.'

It was reported last week the dictator inspected the Ryo Islet Defense Detachment - a vast military base responsible for protecting the island of Ryodo and the coastal city of Wonsan.

Wonson is an area of particular strategic importance to Kim because on its outskirts lies his favourite luxury holiday home.

Kim was quoted as saying: 'The Party Central Committee is attaching great importance to the combined units of submarines'

'[The outpost] is an important combat 
mission of the detachment to definitely turn the islet into an 
impregnable fortress and unsinkable battleship and thus not to allow 
enemies to invade the socialist homeland,' state-run news agancy KCNA 
said.

The young leader and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, have frequently visited the vacation home and last year ordered the creation of the nation's first beach resort in the city.

Kim praised the military detachment for successfully doing 'everything the Party Central Committee considered as good,' while also saying that it is 'a model unit where the party's military policy is being most correctly implemented and a typical one for the whole army to learn from,' according to the report.
