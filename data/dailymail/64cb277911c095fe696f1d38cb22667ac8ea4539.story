President Barack Obama will use his State of the Union address tonight to push tax increases he knows the GOP-led Congress will never pass, let alone consider.

He plans to put Republicans on the defense by characterizing them as the party of big business and special interests while pushing Democrats are the true champions of the middle class.

Although Obama has competed in his last election, his party must be able to show that if trusted with the White House and the Senate again, it will advocate for a platform of reforms that will be a boon to average Americans.

With just two years left in office, Obama is running out of time to build his legacy, which includes digging his political party out of the rut it's in.

On his watch, Democrats ceded the speaker's gavel to the GOP after a  blow out election in 2010 that followed a major effort, spearheaded by the White House, to substantially reform the nation's health care system.

Democrats managed to stop the bleeding two years later, keeping both the Senate and the White House in the 2012 election. But the bandaging was only temporary, and in November, Republicans seized the upper chamber and expanded their majority in the House to a size not seen since the last World War.

While Democrats were defending the president's health care law and forthcoming immigration actions, Republicans were successfully arguing that they would pass a slew of jobs bills targeted at the middle class if propelled to power.

And since taking office, they've lined up a series of votes intended to embarrass Democrats and force them into politically uncomfortable positions, including a vote to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which Republicans and the makers of the conduit claim will create north of 42,000 jobs a year.

The GOP has also seized on several opportunities to amend the president's health law, Obamacare, one of which even received the backing of the White House. 

That measure exempted veterans who already have health care through the government from being counted toward the number of workers that qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance.

For small businesses on the cusp of exceeding 50 workers, the point at which the employer mandate takes effect, the measure could serve as an incentive to bring on unemployed veterans of the armed services.

Unwilling to explain their opposition to legislation that would encourage businesses to 'hire more heroes,' Democrats and the White House threw their support behind the bill this month.

The White House hopes to turn the tables on Republicans during tonight's State of the Union address and make full use of the age-old adage that the GOP cares more about the millionaires and billionaires of the country than it does middle class families.

Although Obama has competed in his last election, his party must be able to show that if trusted with the White House and the Senate again, it will advocate for a platform of reforms that will be a boon to average Americans - something Obama plans to lay the groundwork for tonight in his address at the U.S. Capitol, pictured here early this morning. The government hub is currently under renovation

Obama will tap into that sentiment by proposing $320 billion in tax increases over the next 10 years to pay for everything from community college for hard-working high school students to tax credits for couples earning a combined income of up to $210,000 - all of which he will detail in full in his annual budget, due to come out Feb. 2 this year.

The two main revenue increases included in Obama's plan would affect banks with more than $50 billion in assets, roughly 100 institutions in America, and a tax increase would affect married couples earning more than $500,000 a year.

The suggested fee on big banks is meant to discourage financial institutions from engaging in the risky behaviors that led to the 2008 crash, the White House says.

New taxes on the 1 percent would make up the bulk of the cash the federal government would need to fund Obama's favored programs.

Obama wants to raise high-income earners' capital gains tax to 28 percent from 20 percent and eliminate a tax loophole that allows the wealth to avoid paying fees to the government on their inheritances.

Dubbed the 'Robin Hood tax,' Republicans have already declared the measure dead on arrival.

'This is not a serious proposal,' Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, told the Washington Post.

'We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending.'

In a speech at the Chamber of Commerce this morning, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Chairman of the Senate' Finance Committee, accused Obama of attempting to incite 'class warfare.'

Hatch has set his sights on reforming the tax code. Obama's plan 'appears to be more about redistribution,' he said, per The Hill, which 'is unfortunate, because we’re going to need real leadership from the White House - not just liberal talking points - if tax reform is going to be successful.'

The proposals aren't meant to thrill Republicans. If anything, Obama's speech is meant to incite the opposing party and show them that the White House has no intention of giving up any ground, regardless of the walloping its party received in the last election. Obama was elected to the bully pulpit for an eight-year term, and he plans to use it, White House officials have asserted.

'The president’s going to take this opportunity to make the case directly to the American people why we can, and in fact need to, move forward on an agenda like this,' a senior administration official told reporters during a call previewing the State of the Union.

'We are hopeful that what we will see is a positive response, particularly from those who have championed similar ideas in the past,' the official added, according to Politico.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said today based on previews of Obama's speech, the president misinterpreted the results of the midterm elections.

'The American people aren’t demanding talking-point proposals designed to excite the base but not designed to pass,' McConnell said in a speech before the Senate today. 

'What they said they’re hungry for is substance and accomplishment. They want Washington to get back to work and focus on a serious jobs and reform agenda. They said they’re ready to see more constructive cooperation, especially on bipartisan jobs initiatives,' he said, name-checking the Keystone pipeline, which the Senate will take a series of votes on today.

Obama has said he would veto Keystone legislation if it passes both chambers of Congress. The House has already OK'd the project. Not with enough votes to override the the president, though.

The bill survived a procedural vote in the Senate last week, and it's expected to pass with slightly fewer votes than necessary to nullify an executive action snuffing it out.

McConnell said today the legislation 'will be on the president’s desk before long. We see no reason for him to veto these jobs.

'But whatever he decides, we’re going to keep working for positive, middle-class jobs ideas here in Congress. As I’ve said before, we’re not here to protect the president from a good idea.

'And if the president’s willing to work with us, there’s much we can get accomplished for the American people,' he added.

Senate Republicans have more to lose heading into the next election cycle than the president or his party, though, and Obama's gamble could pay off.

In 2014 just 10 GOP senators were on the ballot. In less than two years Republicans will have to defend 24 seats, including several  in states that Obama won in the last election.

And if Marco Rubio makes a bid for the presidency, they'll have to find someone to run in his stead in the swing state that often decides national elections. The Florida senator has said he won't compete for reelection and higher office at the same time.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul may also find himself in a bind in 2016 as his state's election laws do not allow politicians to appear on the ballot twice for two separate positions. Paul's Senate seat is also up for reelction in two years and he is likely to run for president.
