A missing moggy that vanished from his home has been found ten years after he first disappeared - two miles away and three times as big.

When the cat, named Little Puss, vanished in 2003 from Melanie Ashlin’s home in Outwood, Surrey, he was a seven-month-old kitten. Melanie’s daughter Hollie was still at primary school.

Hollie is now 19 and a dairy farmer - and Little Puss has been piling on the pounds.

Melanie Ashlin was over the moon to be reunited with missing cat Little Puss a decade after it vanished. But the food loving feline now weighs three times what he did when he left

Melanie said: 'His name’s a bit out of date now though - he's massive and perhaps we should start calling him Big Puss!'

When Little Puss left he was a slimline 4lbs. Now he has tripled to a curvier 12lbs.

'He’s very fat and he doesn't stop eating,' Melanie said.

'I don't know whether someone has had him and has been looking after him.

'When he left he was only seven months old. I thought I would never see him again, so it is just amazing.

'It is lovely having him home. He is so sweet, he doesn't really want to go out, he's quite happy here.'

Reunited at last: Melanie can't stop wondering what happened to Little Puss since he walked out of her home. Now her pet is having to get used all the other animals she has

After almost a decade, he was found wandering forlornly and taken to a vet as a stray.

There he was scanned and they found a microchip. That revealed his owners lived just a couple of miles from the spot he was picked up.

Melanie was stunned when she received a call to say they had found her wandering feline.

'I was so shocked - even after ten years,' the mum-of-two said.

'I had never stopped thinking about him and wondering what had happened to him.

'When I went to pick him up I thought he would be a bit feral but although he was obviously a bit scared, he was as good as gold.

Little Puss was discovered on farmland just a couple of miles away in South Nutfield with a group of other cats.

The Cats Protection League was alerted. They took him to a vet in nearby Merstham who scanned him.

Two weeks after he was found he has settled back in with his family.

But he has had to adjust to having company. Melanie also has two dogs, two cats and five chickens.

'Hollie was just 10 when Little Puss went missing and now she is 19, said Melanie, who also has a 31-year-old son.

'Since he disappeared I have had two grandchildren.

'I look at him and say, "Where have you been all these years?" I wish he could tell me.

'With all the snow we have had in the past few years, I always wondered whether he had somewhere to live.

'I wondered whether he was dead, if he'd got run over.

'He was always in the back of my mind.'
