Hillary Clinton has taken a jab at Vice President Joe Biden by questioning his support for the Osama bin Laden raid.

The dig marks an important line of offense for Clinton as Biden would be her strongest competition if they both decide to run as the next Democratic nominee for president in 2016.

At a conference in Atlanta on Tuesday, the former Secretary of State told a version of events where she was in favor of giving the Navy SEAL mission the go-ahead to kill the terrorist but Biden was more uncertain.

Competitors: Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden (Seen here together in 2011) are widely considered the most likely candidates for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016

Clinton spoke at the National Association of Convenience Stores and a politician in the audience told the local paper about what she said.

'I know sheâ€™s running for president now, because toward the end, she was asked about the Osama bin Laden raid. She took 25 minutes to answer,' state representative Tom Taylor told the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

'Without turning the knife too deeply, she put it to (Vice President Joe) Biden.'

No press was allowed inside the event, but Taylor reported that she portrayed herself as being one of the strongest supporters of the raid- alongside then-CIA director Leon Panetta.

In the room: Clinton said that she was in support of the May 2011 raid while Biden was more cautious and concerned

By contrast, she mentioned that Biden was against the raid multiple times during the speech.

The success of the raid is a significant and Clinton knows it: Bill Clinton even talked about Obama's decision to give the raid the go-ahead during a campaign TV spot during the 2012 re-election.

Neither Clinton nor Biden have officially announced that they're running to take over the White House after President Obama's second term ends in 2016, but their actions have been speaking for them.

Clinton has made a number of speeches at conferences after taking a break from the public eye following the end of her term as a cabinet member in January.

Picking sides? Many read into President Obama's decision to be interviewed for the first time after being re-elected alongside Clinton instead of Biden

Publicly supportive: Vice President Biden spoke at the Clinton Global Initiative conference late last month, as the event is run by his possible rival and her husband

As she was leaving office, she sat down for a televised interview along with President Obama, and that was viewed in political circles as a silent endorsement by her former competitor as he chose to have Clinton in that interview and not his vice president.

Biden has been doing his own campaigning, however, as he attended a function in the crucial primary battleground state of Iowa last month.

Even still, that might not be enough as three of President Obama's top aides have all publicly stated that they think the Democratic nomination belongs to Clinton.

'I think that Hillary Clinton probably will be the candidate. If she doesn't run, I think Biden will run,' former senior White House advisor David Axelrod said in a June interview according to Politico.
