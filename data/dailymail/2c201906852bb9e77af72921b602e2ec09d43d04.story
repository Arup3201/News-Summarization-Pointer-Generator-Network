Barbara Clough, the widow of legendary manager Brian, has died.

Clough married Barbara in 1959 while playing for Middlesbrough, and went on to become one of the greatest - and feistiest - managers of all time, most notably in charge of Nottingham Forest and Derby.

She leaves behind her family which includes son Nigel, the current Derby County manager who played for his father's Nottingham Forest in the 1980s and 1990s.

Former Derby County player Roy MacFarland led the tributes to Mrs Clough and called her 'the woman behind the man'.

He told The Mirror: 'I imagine at times Brian must have been rather difficult to live with. Barbara sorted out the kids, the home, the family and everything else.

'She was the rock behind him, she gave him the time and the confidence to do what he had to do.'

Nigel, along with siblings Simon and Elizabeth, released a family statement, saying: 'Our Mum sadly passed away on Saturday evening after a short illness.

'She will be greatly missed by everyone.

'Our thanks go to the staff at the Royal Derby Hospital, especially those in the Nightingale MacMillan Unit.

'It is a sad time for the family and we would appreciate if our privacy could be respected at this time.'
