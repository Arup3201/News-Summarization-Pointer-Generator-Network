An airstrike which demolished an apartment block in eastern Ukraine has killed at least 11 civilians.

The four-story building in Snizhne, a town in the rebel-dominated Donetsk region, appeared to have been hit by two missiles which wiped out several tiers at once. 

The attack adds to the hundreds of casualties who have died during the pro-Russian insurgency over the last four months.

Rescue workers managed to pull one small child with broken legs alive from the rubble. 

Government officials denied claims that the attack was carried out by Ukraine's air force, but did not say who was to blame.

The Defense Ministry insisted the bombing could not have been carried out by the air force as none of its planes were deployed at the time of the strike.

Ukraine's Security Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko called the incident a 'cynical and bloody provocation' aimed at discrediting the armed forces.

No official death toll has been produced, but hundreds of civilians are believed to have been killed to date. Authorities believe 258 servicemen have been killed in fighting and 922 injured.

The separatist Luhansk People's Republic said that 12 more civilians were killed Monday evening in the eastern city of Luhansk following rocket attacks and airstrikes. It was not immediately possible to verify those claims.

On Monday, Ukraine said one of its military transport planes carrying eight personnel was shot down by a missile fired from Russian territory. 

Security Service chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said there was 'unconditional evidence' that Russia was involved in downing the craft.

Defense Ministry representatives initially suggested all those on the plane had survived and been accounted for. The ministry updated its account to specify that while four on the plane were evacuated, another two were taken captive by rebels and that the whereabouts of two more is unknown.

In the last two weeks, the government has halved the territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists, who have been forced back into the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. Many in the armed insurgency are known to be Russian nationals, but Moscow says they are simply citizens who went to fight in Ukraine on their own.

Rubble: People carry out computers buried in the debris from the collapsed building

Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of involvement in attacks on its troops and supplying rebels with weaponry.

Lysenko said Ukrainian border guards came under gunfire from inside Russian territory. He did not specify that he believed Russia to be directly responsible for the attack.

Moscow has in turn accused Ukraine of shelling a border town inside Russia, killing one person. But Ukraine has denied firing shells onto foreign soil.

A delegation of international military attaches and reporters Tuesday visited the site of the shelling, in the Russian border town of Donetsk, in what a senior Russian Defense Ministry official termed an 'act of good will.' 

Officials showed a residential building damaged by the rocket and a series of craters next to a border crossing

Blame: Government official have denied the Tuesday strike was carried out by Ukraine's air force

Loss: A woman, name no given, cries as the debris from her destroyed apartment is cleaned up
