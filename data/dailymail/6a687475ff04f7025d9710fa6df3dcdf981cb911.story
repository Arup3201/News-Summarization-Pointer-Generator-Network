Let's hope they kept both hands on the wheel!

A new survey has found that 11 percent of drivers have had sex while driving.

The online questionnaire attempted to discover how much 'living' goes on in people’s cars – whether it be eating, using their phone or having sex.

Those aged 35 to 44 were the leading age group for acknowledging their sexual exploits in moving cars.

The Scout GPS survey, which involved around 2,000 people found men were three times more likely to admit to participating in sexual activity than women (17 percent and 5 percent respectively).

Men were also twice as likey to flirt with another driver.

10% have applied makeup and somehow 4% even admitted to reading a book behing the wheel.

Having a meal was also something people admitted to doing whilst in the driver's seat - and not just a sandwich or a burger that would only require the use of one hand, but 19% said they had eaten something that required a knife and fork.

The survey also revealed some intriguing figures on what people would get up to if no-one was watching.

Nine percent of respondents said they’d drive naked, 15 percent said they would have sex, 30 percent said they would pick their noses and 54 percent admitted they would sing out loud.

Some disturbing trends were revealed about the use of cellphones with 19 percent of participants admitting they had checked social media, email, or played games whilst driving.

60 percent confirmed they had used a phone in some capacity.

Shaving while driving was the most dangerous activity.

Of those who confessed to shaving in the survey, almost one-in-five said they had actually been in an accident.
