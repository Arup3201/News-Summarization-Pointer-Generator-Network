Ronald Koeman believes the way Southampton perform in the next two matches against sides fighting for their Premier League status could be crucial in determining how high Saints finish this season.

Southampton go to West Brom on Saturday bidding to bounce back from the 2-0 home loss to Liverpool which dented their Champions League dream.

The Baggies and next Tuesday's opponents Crystal Palace are five points clear of the relegation zone entering this weekend's fixtures.

And while their ambitions are at different ends of the standings, Koeman knows his fifth-placed side must show their ability and be more efficient against West Brom and Palace.

'We will play a lot for our chances for a high position in the table in the next two games. We have to realise that,' he said.

'We have to be prepared for that. I think we're doing well, if you go back to the game against Liverpool, we played well.

'We deserved much more than we got. Now it's about being more effective.

'That's maybe the question at the moment. We're not effective enough to score and to win games. (But) total feel of the team I am happy.'

Tony Pulis has provided added steel to West Brom since being installed as manager, and Koeman is wary.

The Dutchman said: 'I have watched two games of theirs the last few weeks.

'It's normal that, as a manager, coming into a new team, you try to sort out the defensive organisation. They have.

'It's not easy to score against them. All the results are very close, not a lot of goals in their games.

'Always the opponent has more ball possession, but it's not always about having ball possession. It's about what you make of that.

'They're very strong in set-pieces, because they have as a team, the highest score of scoring at set-pieces.

'They fight for every point and they play out of the qualities that they have. That's the best you can do as a manager.'

Koeman knows league position means little when it comes to the match-ups.

Defender Toby Alderweireld could start at the Hawthorns after recovering from a hamstring injury

'A lot of clubs play not to be relegated or to go in the Europa League or for the Champions League positions,' he said.

'Everyone will fight. My experience after one season in the Premier League is that every game is difficult.

'You can win or lose against anybody. You have to go game by game, in my opinion.'

Sadio Mane could start after being punished for his poor timekeeping.

The Senegal winger was late ahead of the Liverpool clash and was a substitute.

Toby Alderweireld (hamstring) is nearing a return and could come back into contention for the Palace game, but Jay Rodriguez (knee) and Emmanuel Mayuka (groin) remain out.
