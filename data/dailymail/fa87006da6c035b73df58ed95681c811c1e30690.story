The mild weather that has heralded the beginning of 2013 will be replaced with freezing temperatures, sleet and even snow - and it could last three weeks.

Met Office forecasters say the temperature could plunge to -15C in some parts of the north next week as part of a cold weather snap likely to last until early February.

'We will notice the temperature dropping over the next few days and there is a chance of snow on the high ground in the north of the country on Thursday,' said Helen Chivers, of the Met Office.

'From next week temperatures will be around 5C and there will be a chance of frost at night, when temperatures could fall to -5C in the countryside.'

Peaceful: People are making the most of the mild weather, such as these sightseers on the River Cam in Cambridge, but extreme cold, rain and snow are on the way

Chill: A snow plough clears the road of snow near Nenthead, Cumbria last week. More scenes like this are expected as a mild early January gives way to harsh winter weather

The Met Office also said that winter showers are likely next week and winds 
coming in from the North East may cause snow flurries as well. 

The beginning of January's milder weather meant blossom has started to bloom two months early, thanks to temperatures hovering around 10C.

Visitors to Cambridge were also making the most of the unusually high temperatures today as they punted on the River Cam.

But
temperatures are set to plunge below freezing this week with a day of 
clear skies and sunshine followed by widespread frost overnight into 
Thursday.

Warm winds from the south and 
extensive cloud cover have meant that the UK has been experiencing above
average temperatures for this time of year.

A Met office spokesman said: ‘We have been seeing a lot of double figures recently.

‘Average temperatures for this time of year are close to freezing at night but they have been holding up at 6 to 8C.’

The mild spell saw unseasonably high temperatures over the holiday period, with 14.3C (57F) in Wester Ross, Scotland, last Wednesday and 12.8C (55F) in Usk, Monmouthshire on Thursday.

Blooming lovely: Lucy Moir, 22, picks snowdrops which have flowered early at Painswick Rococo Garden in Painswick, Gloucestershire

Jumping for joy: Visitors to Cambridge have been delighted by the pink blossom on trees in the historic city

The warm weather has meant an array of snowdrops has carpeted
one garden in Painswick, Gloucestershire.

Paul
Hervey-Brookes, garden adviser at Rococo, said: 'They usually start to 
bloom around the second week of January and the last to flower finish by
the end of March.

'But because it has been mild this 
year so far, they have been tricked into thinking it is later in January
than it is, and they have started to come out.

Visitors to Cambridge 
have marvelled at trees lit up with pink flowers in the historic city.

Blossom
usually appears in March and is a sign that spring is on its way, but 
visitors to Cambridge were able to enjoy the beautiful spectacle in the 
first week of January.

Rachel Clarke, 37, from Cambridge, 
said: ‘It's lovely to see the blossom after weeks of wind and rain. 
Hopefully it's a sign that the weather will be better this year.’

Beauty: A winter red sky soon emerged as the sun rose over Bristol. Forecasters expect cold, frosty and more wintry weather to return to the UK this week

New day: Allotments are just visible as the winter sun rises

Met Office forecaster Craig Snell 
said: ‘Temperatures will trend colder, with
frost more widespread, and it is most likely to remain cold into next 
week with wintry showers, especially in central and eastern parts, with 
overnight frosts but also a good deal of fine and dry weather.

‘Later next week is most likely to 
remain colder than average, and from January 21 to February 4, there is 
an increasing probability of a trend to colder conditions relative to 
what we have seen so far this winter.

‘This brings the risk of spells of 
colder-than-average conditions and wintry weather, especially across 
northern and eastern areas.’

Tom Tobler, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'It will be freezing in some areas this week but could get slightly colder if the skies are clearer than forecast.

'This would be a return to more typical January temperatures than the milder weather we've been having. There is the potential next week for some colder weather.'

Mr Snell added: ‘From
next weekend, there is a lot of uncertainty in the forecast. We’re on 
the boundary between colder air and warmer air.'

After a miserable 2012 - the second wettest on record - the prospect of a dry start to 2013 was welcome.

But it seems the mild weather was just a blip, with a return to cold, wet, grey days in the week ahead.

There will certainly be nothing compared with the grim winter of 50 years ago. In early 1963, the Thames froze, 6ft snowdrifts blocked London streets - and food prices soared.
