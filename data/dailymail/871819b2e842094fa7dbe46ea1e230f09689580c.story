It was the rom com that defined the early 2000s.

But the manipulative and undermining world portrayed in Lindsay Lohan's film Mean Girls is far from fiction, teachers claim.

Though boys can be rowdy, their female classmates are 'meaner and smarter in their approach' - and deliberately target women teachers to demonstrate their dominance.

'Nightmare': Teachers claim popular girls, like the 'plastics' in Mean Girls, are manipulative and impossible to control

Targeted: Secondary school teacher Georgia Neale says she, like Tina Fey's character, is targeted by these girls

The claims appear to dispel long-held beliefs that girls have a calming influence on school life.

Secondary school teacher Georgia Neale told the Times Educational Supplement: 'Boys are far more malleable. They are not perfect: the aggressive ones shout their mouths off and scarper, sometimes punching walls along the way.

'But girls are decidedly meaner and smarter in their approach.'

She added: 'The queen bee will often try to use her top-notch position to undermine female teachers.

'It is difficult to teach a girl who feels you should be her subordinate, especially when said girl believes that complying with the most basic requirements would mean showing weakness in front of her friends.'

Another female teacher said: 'Classroom management-wise, girls are an absolute nightmare for female secondary school teachers'.

Manipulative: Teachers claim girls will do anything to stop female teachers dispelling their sense of power

In a 2012 report on gender and behaviour in schools, the Department for Education found boys aged 11 to 14 are far worse behaved than their female classmates.

However, boys are more likely to admit when they have misbehaved than girls.

Boys in that age group, the report stated, show a sharp surge in their displays of anti-social behaviour - such as verbal abuse and aggression.

Meanwhile, a significant proportion of girls experience problems related to self-harm, depression and eating disorders.
