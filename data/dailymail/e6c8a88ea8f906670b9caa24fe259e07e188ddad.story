England shotgun ace Charlotte Kerwood blasted her way to Commonwealth Games glory in the double trap.

The 27-year-old from Sussex was in devastating form at the Barry Buddon Centre in Dundee, nailing 94 of her 120 clays to claim her third individual Commonwealth gold medal.

Kerwood won her first gold at Manchester 2002 aged just 15, and would probably have more in her collection had the event not been excluded in Delhi last time out.

Easy peasy: Kerwood won her third Commonwealth Games gold medal in the double trap on Sunday

She finished two shots clear of India's Shreyasi Singh, who claimed silver.

Rachel Parish, with whom Kerwood also won pairs gold at Melbourne 2006, made it a medal double for England by taking bronze.

The 33-year-old from Nottingham finished level with Canada's Cynthia Meyer on 91 and triumphed in a sudden-death shoot-off.

Kerwood led by five shots at the start of the final round and appeared relaxed, smiling and laughing, as the competitors lined up.

But with Singh and Meyer closing in, she missed a pair halfway through the round and gave herself a dressing down before holding her nerve over the final few shots.

'It feels pretty good, I can't quite believe it,' Kerwood told Press Association Sport. 'The Commonwealth Games obviously like me, it's a good event to come to.

'I was laughing because I didn't realise I was five targets ahead at the start, so I thought 'no pressure!' Then I felt it was slipping away from me a little bit, which wasn't good. But now it feels amazing.'

Kerwood will have little opportunity to celebrate, though, as she lines up in her favoured event, the Olympic trap, on Monday morning.

'That will be good experience for tomorrow because now I know what to expect with the crowd and everything.

'There's no time to celebrate yet. Tomorrow is what I have been training for. My coach thinks I was crazy going for this one as well but I'm going to be more confident now.'

For Parish, who claimed silver behind Kerwood in the individual event eight years ago, it was also a test of nerve in the shoot-off.

'I've practised doing that before with the other England guys, I knew what was coming and I knew I'd done it before and I could do it again - and I did,' she said.

'I'm disappointed with the way I shot today, I know I can shoot a lot better than that, so I'm really pleased to have come away with a medal.

'I think there will be some champagne now. Possibly a lot!'
