The eight-year-old Hasidic boy who was kidnapped, murdered and dismembered had been drugged with a lethal combination of painkillers and muscle relaxants before he was smothered with a towel, an autopsy has revealed.

Leiby Kletzky was killed in Brooklyn, New York, last week after getting lost on his way home from a day camp and innocently asking 35-year-old Levi Aron for help.

Police searched Aron's home and found the boy's severed feet wrapped in plastic in the man's freezer, and the rest of his body in trash bins near the house. A chopping board and three bloody carving knives were also found in Aron's kitchen, authorities said.

Today an autopsy revealed little Leiby died from the combined effects of cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant, quetiapine, an antipsychotic, and the
pain medications hydrocodone and Tylenol.

He was then smothered with a towel, before his body was hacked to pieces. But Aron was allegedly left with scratches on his arms, suggesting Leiby fought courageously during the horrific ordeal - even though his feet were tied together.

The results were released as his family left 
their Brooklyn apartment for a walk around the mostly Hasidic 
neighbourhood, marking the end of the 
traditional mourning period of Shiva.

The took the early morning walk to 'escort the soul to its final resting place', Rabbi Jack Meyer told the New York Post.

Detectives today said they believe 
Leiby was murdered late last Tuesday afternoon, after Aron returned from
work - meaning the boy was alive for a day after he disappeared.

Aron has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and kidnapping.

Outpouring: At least 8,000 people gathered in Brooklyn as Leiby's casket was carried to his funeral service

Prosecutors
allege Aron lured Leiby into his home on July 11. Video cameras 
captured the fateful encounter between the two on a Brooklyn street as 
Leiby's mother waited anxiously just a few blocks away.

Police and prosecutors said Aron, a 
clerk at a hardware supply store, has confessed to suffocating the boy 
with a bath towel, but they continued to work on verifying his horrific 
and bizarre explanation for the boy's death.

Inside court his attorney, Pierre Bazile, said his client told him he heard voices and suffered from hallucinations.

Police said that Aron told investigators
he brought the child to a suburban wedding about 35 miles away and 
spent several hours there. Other wedding guests confirmed Aron was there
but didn't see the boy.

Today chief police spokesman Paul Browne said: 'Detectives now have reason to believe beyond Aron's confession that Leiby was at the wedding, but not necessarily inside the venue.'

By the time the pair returned to the city, it was so late that Aron decided to take Leiby to his home to sleep and left him there Tuesday while he went to work, according to the police version of the confession.

Workers at the supply store said Aron showed up as usual that day but seemed troubled.

Aron told police he killed Leiby when he got home after being spooked by a massive search for the boy in Borough Park section of Brooklyn, home to one of the world's largest communities of Orthodox Jews outside of Israel.

He allegedly told police: 'When I saw the fliers, I panicked and was afraid.'

Investigators also have said Leiby may have been tied up and tried to fight back.Â 

NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly said Aron had scratches on his arms, wrists and elsewhere - a sign 'there was some kind of struggle'.

There also were marks on the boy's remains that could have been caused by restraints, the commissioner added.

The medical examiner does not comment on any injuries to a body that were not involved in causing death.

The autopsy results came as city councilman David Greenfield 
announced plans for 'Leiby's Law', which would turn shops on every block
in the city into safe havens for children who are lost.

Homes and shops would have to submit to a $50 background check, and could then display green 'Safe Haven' stickers in their windows.
