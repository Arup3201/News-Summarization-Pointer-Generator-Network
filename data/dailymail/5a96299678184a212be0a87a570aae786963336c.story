A council has come under fire after launching an investigation into a noise complaint about two flags which were put up to advertise a holiday park.

Council inspectors were sent to examine the upright banners, which were pitched on a grass verge more than 200 metres from the nearest house, after a member of the public complained about the noise of them.

Environmental health investigators visited the site to measure how loud the flags were and are now considering if ‘further assessment is needed’.

Mike Pearce, owner of the Strawberry Fields Holiday Park in Cheddar, Somerset, said: ‘A couple of environmental health officers came out and did their thing.

‘There are a few people who were not happy that we were given planning permission for the holiday park, so a few complaints have been made, but this one really takes the biscuit.

‘We haven’t had any communication from them since they visited, so I suspect they couldn’t find a problem.

‘To be honest, the traffic moving down the road is louder than any noise those flags make.’

The flags are set in ground close to the Early Doors pub and landlord Peter Smith said investigating the ‘idiotic’ complaint was a waste of taxpayers’ money.

He said: ‘I find it completely idiotic that someone can complain about the noise from a couple of banners.

The two flags were put up to advertise a nearby holiday park but council officers were sent to examine them after a member of the public complained about the noise they make

‘Just look at the cost to us taxpayers of the environmental health officer coming all the way from Sedgemoor.

‘We can’t even hear them from the barn and the nearest houses are 200 metres away. It’s sad and pathetic.’

Sedgemoor District Council said: ‘Following a complaint from a visitor to the area environmental health staff have visited to assess if the flags are causing a noise nuisance.

‘We will now consider what, if any, further assessment is needed.’
