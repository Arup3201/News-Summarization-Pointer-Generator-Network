The Irish tourist who left his brother fighting for life in an alleged one-punch attack has avoided jail.

Barry Lyttle, 33, has been given a 13-month suspended jail sentence after he pleaded guilty earlier this month to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to his younger brother Patrick.

Patrick, 31, was rushed to hospital and spent six days in a coma after he was allegedly struck by his brother, Barry in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner-city on January 3.

But on Friday, Patrick had his arm around his brother, who was crying when Magistrate Graeme Curran handed down the sentence in the Downing Centre Local Court.

Patrick spent nearly a week in an induced coma in January following his brother's alleged attack before making his remarkable recovery at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner suburbs.

Appearing outside of court on Friday, Patrick told reporters his brother has been through an 'awful lot throughout this whole process'.

'Just delighted to go home with the family now,' Patrick said.

Mr Curran said Patrick appeared to have recovered well since the incident and probably didn't require further treatment.

While the brothers had been drinking during their out night in Kings Cross, Mr Curran found alcohol was not a significant factor.

He said Barry was of good character, remorseful and unlikely to re-offend.

Supporters in the court gasped as Barry was told he was being sentenced to jail but were hugging minutes later when the entire sentence was suspended.

The brothers plan to speak to youth about the dangers of one-punch assaults when they return to Northern Ireland.

The Sentence comes after Downing Centre Local Court was told of the guilty plea during a brief mention, where Barry was supported by family, including his younger brother Patrick.

Barry's legal team had tried to negotiate a lesser charge over the attack, with Patrick publicly speaking out in support of his brother and calling for the charges to be dismissed.

But prosecutors decided to go ahead with the original charge and that Lyttle agreed to plead guilty.

The hearing was expected to include CCTV footage of the attack and evidence from criminologist John Braithwaite, an expert in 'restorative justice', which covers sentencing options other than imprisonment.

During a brief mention of the matter earlier this month, the prosecutor asked for a further adjournment saying police had served both parties with further material and they needed more time to negotiate.

Patrick had previously called on the charges laid against his brother to be dropped.

The brothers, who have been accompanied by their father OIiver throughout their stay in Australia, wish to return home to Ireland together as soon as possible.
