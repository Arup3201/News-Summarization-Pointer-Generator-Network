Bode Miller mastered the Olympic course on his very first run on Thursday, leading the opening downhill training session.

The U.S. skier, who won a bronze medal in the event four years ago, was cheered on by his wife, volleyball player, Morgan Beck, at the base of the Rosa Khutor run.

His one-year-old son, Nate, is in New York with his mother, Sara McKenna, but it is presumed he will be joining Miller and his wife in Sochi after a temporary custody agreement with McKenna determined he could go to Russia.

But on the slopes on Thursday, Miller's thoughts were on clocking the best time; the 36-year-old came in at 2 minutes and 7.75 seconds, giving him the top spot for the training run.

Winner: U.S. skier Bode Miller, pictured preparing for downhill training in Sochi on Thursday, mastered the course and came in with the fastest time - 2 minutes, 7.75 seconds

Strong: He has come back from an injured knee, which forced him to take an entire season off

'Unfortunately they don't give you medals
 for training runs,' Miller said. 'If they did, I would be psyched 
today. But it certainly doesn't hurt to come out here and ski well first
 run. I just have to keep trimming time.'

Patrick Kueng of Switzerland, who won the classic downhill in Wengen on home snow last month, was second, a slim 0.03 seconds behind. Matthias Mayer of Austria was third, 0.17 behind.

Marco Sullivan of the U.S. was fourth, although he was one of several skiers who missed gates. Italy's Christof Innerhofer was fifth, 0.69 behind, and should be a contender on the course.

Miller, who has indicated this could be his last Olympics, cut his 2011-12 season short after an injury in Sochi and had microfracture surgery. He took all of last season off to let his knee properly heel.

He faced trouble in his personal life too - losing his younger brother Nathaniel, who died of a seizure last April, and struggling through a custody battle after learning McKenna was pregnant.

Miller and McKenna had a brief 
relationship in 2012 in California after meeting on a high-end dating website and after they went on a few dates, McKenna discovered she was pregnant.

But Miller, who also has a five-year-old daughter from another relationship, had already started dating volleyball player Morgan Beck, and after five months they married.

The case became a 
cause for women's rights advocates after a judge castigated McKenna for 
moving while pregnant to New York. She's a former marine and firefighter now studying at Columbia 
University.

As they battled with the courts, his wife Morgan fell pregnant - but suffered a miscarriage soon after.

McKenna has had temporary custody of the boy, whom Miller calls Nate but whom McKenna calls Sam, since 
November while Miller was away in Canada and Colorado seeking to qualify.

On his way: It is believed that Miller will be joined by his son Nate, pictured together last year, in Sochi after winning a temporary custody order in December that allows the one-year-old to go to Russia

Adorable: Morgan shared a photo of baby Nate relaxing next to his dad on a private plane last year

Dispute: Nate's mother is Sara McKenna, a former Marine who met Miller on a dating website in 2012. They have been involved in a long custody battle since the baby's birth last February

But at the end of the year, McKenna and Miller hammered out the details of a temporary custody agreement in place until at least a March 31 court date. It also allows him to take his son to Sochi.

After the struggles - both professionally and personally - Miller seemingly regained his form and finished second in a World Cup giant slalom in December.

Then he had two podium results on the famed Streif course in Kitzbuehel, Austria, last month.

But last weekend he banged up his right knee during a crash in a giant slalom in St. Moritz, Switzerland.

'It's still puffed up a little bit and a little bit sore,' Miller said. 'There's nothing wrong with it, just got banged hard.'

Consequently, Miller was a bit tentative on the Sochi course's biggest jump, labeled the Russian Trampoline, which comes midway down.Â

No rest: Morgan shared a photo of her heading to the gym before her husband's training run

'It's really bumpy and rattley,' he said of the icy landing area. 'That's one of the places where I went way out in the soft snow.'

Overall, though, Miller was pleased to see that the course hadn't been altered much since the 2012 test event, in which several other skiers were also injured.

'They didn't dumb it down much, which is nice,' said Miller, who finished fourth in the test downhill.

'They didn't ice the top, which is understandable - the turns are huge up there. The swing and turns would make it very tough for guys on top if it were icy. It would be better for me but that's fine. I still feel like I have the ability to ski that top and put time on guys.

'But once you come out of the chute all the way down they didn't take anything away. The speeds are up, the terrain is challenging and the jumps are big.

Fighter: Miller (pictured Thursday) suffered a knee injury on the course in 2012. His events start on Sunday

'There's a lot of different places where you can make mistakes and where it's really challenging - especially linking sections together.'

The training session was held in perfect conditions, under a bright sun and clear skies. The snow was grippy on top, icier in the middle section and softer at the bottom where the temperature was above the freezing. All 61 racers who started reached the finish.

Two more training sessions are scheduled before Sunday's race opens the Alpine events.
