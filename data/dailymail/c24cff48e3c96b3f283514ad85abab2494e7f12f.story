A tourist's camera has washed up five years after it disappeared, surviving a 5,200-mile journey to another continent - with its photos still intact.

The Canon underwater camera was lost by Lindsay Crumbley Scallan from Georgia on a vacation to Maui in Hawaii back in 2007.

It was found last month on a beach in Taiwan - thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean.

Blast from the past: A Canon diving camera belonging to a woman from Georgia washed up on a beach in Taiwan five years after she lost it in Hawaii

Return to me: Lindsay Crumbley Scallan from Georgia was tracked down using the pictures on the washed up camera - including this one taken in Maui in 2007

Ms Scallan was tracked down because, miraculously, the memory card on her specialist diving camera had survived five years under the water.

The images show the tourist posing in a floral dress as the sun sets over the Hawaiian coast, along with pictures of marine life from dives.

A friend had recognized her when the picture was shown on a local Hawaiian TV news broadcast. 

Douglas Cheng, a manager for China Airlines, said an employee was walking on a beach in Taiwan and found 'something strange' resting in the sand.

There, beneath a light covering of 
crusty barnacles and sand, was a beat-up Canon camera with its memory 
card preserved inside.

His company has now offered Ms Scallan a free round-trip to Taiwan to collect her camera. 

Lee Wen-yi, from China Airlines told Yahoo: 'Ms Scallan is welcome to visit Taiwan so that she can take home the invaluable memories of her trip to Hawaii.'

Memories: An underwater camera believed to have drifted away from its owner in August of 2007 during a snorkeling trip in Hawaii has reappeared with all of it photos seen intact, in Taiwan

Tiny traveler: The small Canon camera is seen still with a few barnacles on its casing after recently found on a beach along Taiwan's east coast

Details: After reviewing the photos, that were remarkably perfectly preserved inside, they're believed to have come from a diving trip in Kannapali
