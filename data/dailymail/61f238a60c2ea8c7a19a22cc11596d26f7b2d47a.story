At first glance you'd be forgiven for mistaking this pink Lycra-clad woman for yet another Towie star embarking on a new fitness regime for the cameras.

But a closer glance reveals this determined figure to be Labour MP Simon Danczuk's wife Karen, who was recently labelled fat by Twitter trolls after posting a series of revealing selfies.

The 31-year-old was seen exercising with a personal trainer at park in Rochdale, Greater Manchester - just weeks after she admitted that the abuse had motivated her to lose half a stone.

The mother-of-two, who is married to 47-year-old Rochdale MP Mr Danczuk, completed a challenging total-body circuit yesterday - which included push-ups, boxing and lunges.

Social media fan: The Rochdale councillor saw her popularity soar after she posted dozens of photographs in recent months, mostly of her cleavage. She has defended her 'selfies', saying they aren't supposed to be sexy

She was kept on track by her trainer, Ben Bate, from Bodypro personal training studios in Rochdale. 

The Rochdale councillor saw her popularity soar after she posted dozens of photographs in recent months, mostly of her cleavage. 

Mrs Danczuk 'selfies' have attracted national attention and she has gained more than 25,000 followers since uploading the steady stream of images.

Critics have attacked Mrs Danczuk - who has previously posted that she is a UK size 10 - for her pictures, with many calling her 'fat'. 

But she has continued to address criticism, claiming the photos 'aren't supposed to be sexy' and saying that online abuse had only motivated her to lose weight.

Abuse: Critics have attacked Mrs Danczuk - who has previously posted that she is a UK size 10 - for her pictures, with many calling her 'fat'. Above, the 31-year-old during her workout yesterday

Routine: Last month, Mrs Danczuk posted two photographs of herself - standing side-on as she looked in a mirror - with a caption that 'thanked her trolls for calling her fat', adding that she had lost half a stone

Strong: Mrs Danczuk has posted a number of pictures online that chart her varied workout routine. Yesterday she took her regime outdoors - meeting with trainer Ben Bate (pictured), from Bodypro, in Rochdale

Earlier this year, she said: 'I'm not an attention seeker. I don't roll out of clubs drunk. I'm not silly. I'm not a crazy party animal. I'm not a girly girl and I rarely wear make-up. In fact, I'm quite a tomboy.

'Not all my tops are low-necked. I don't wear short dresses — all my dresses are knee-length. Gosh, I've seen more flesh in the supermarket than I have in my photos.'

And last month she posted two photographs of herself on Twitter, with a caption that read: 'Can I please thank my trolls for calling me fat, I've lost over half a stone & feel fantastic KD #lastlaugh.'

Family: Mrs Danczuk married Labour MP Simon Danczuk in 2012 and the couple have two young sons

Mrs Danczuk was pictured yesterday as she worked out with trainer Ben Bate, who was seen throwing a medicine ball at her as she did lunges.

It comes just a day after it was revealed that Mrs Danczuk has decided to sell a number of signed and scented pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay.

She said she had decided to bow to public demand and sell the pictures of herself for £10, insisting that it was good business sense and a way of interacting with people.

Mrs Danczuk said that she is already having to order more copies after she sold 400 in less than 24 hours and attracted more than 4,000 views to the listing.
