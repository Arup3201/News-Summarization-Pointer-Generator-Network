He is not performing for another 50 days but obsessively dedicated Justin Bieber fans in Brazil have already started queuing to ensure they get the best front row spots.

About 150 Beliebers in Rio de Janeiro put up 17 tents last week to camp out until his November 3 concert at the Sambadrome.

The teenage and adult fans take it in turns to sleep in the Belieber camp overnight to reserve their spot.

Clampdown: Police banned under 18s from the camp at night over safety fears and a number of robberies

Around 50 people were camping out with up to four people bedding down in one tent at a time.

It had all been planned out with a well organised rota of names and times until Rio municipal authority stepped in and clamped down on their plans.

On Monday, officials from the Social Development department swooped on the tent city to inspect safety and hygiene conditions, and to ban teenagers under the age of 18 from remaining overnight.

They also ordered the youngsters to return to school or face disciplinary procedures.

About 30 unaccompanied minors were found staying at the site. The authorities immediately threatened to close the camp down and report their parents to social services if the children remained.

'Legal guardians who are not watching their children could have their youngsters taken away from them,' warned Rio municipal social worker, Renato Lopes.

'If the camp is considered harmful and those staying there do not abide by our regulations we will dismantle it.'

City police officers and representatives from the Public Order Department also visited the area and instructed fans to take down their stalls lining the pavement along Avenida Salvador de Sá during the day as it obstructed pedestrians’ pathway.

As a concession for those who remained, the authorities agreed to allow the campers to put up their tents at 9pm every night until 7am the next day.  According to the Public Order agents, the camp violates the council’s code of conduct, which prohibits the installation of shacks on public roads or sidewalks.

Last night the Mail Online visited the Belieber camp site near the centre of Rio de Janeiro and found a depleted base but an enthusiastic bunch of fans who are still determined to sit it out for the 50 day wait until the show.

Only two tents remain, with around eight fans, over the age of 18, keeping guard of their positions on behalf of 150 other individuals.

Even though it was raining hard and the temperatures had dipped making it a slightly chilly night, the ones settling in for the long haul were undeterred by  the hardship of their roadside environment.

'I’m certainly not put off by sleeping rough,' says Norton Braga, a 19-year-old student and the first person in the queue.

'I absolutely love Justin Bieber, I identify with his music. He inspires me and touches my heart.'

Braga has been instrumental in organising the camp and constantly liaises with the police to ensure that fans are seen to be sticking to the rules. He also sorts out the rota of names for the two shifts.

The day crew starts at 11am until 6pm then hand over to the overnight watch who stay until 11 the following morning.

The tents have been erected beside the Sambadrome 24 hour security kiosk which has two guards in attendance day and night. Further down the road is the Rio de Janeiro military police headquarters.

Despite the close quarters of the security several members of the group were robbed of money and possessions by drug addicts in the early days of queuing.

While the Mail Online was there, three municipal police officers arrived to check the tents had been put up at the agreed time and only those allowed to stay had remained.

'We are concerned about their safety during the night as it is not an ideal location to be in. It’s not a dangerous area but I wouldn’t let my 16-year-old sleep here overnight,' says municipal police guard Marco Teixeira. 

'We will be driving past regularly throughout the night to keep an eye on them,' he adds.

By the time the officers arrived all of the underage fans had gone home.

One of them is Carolina Rangel, 14, who said: 'I was devastated when the police banned me from staying at the campsite over night and during the day without an adult.

'My parents are a little concerned about me being down here but they support me because they know it’s my dream to see Justin and be as close to him as possible.

'From now on, I’m only allowed to come down on Saturdays and my mum or dad has to stay with me.'

Even though they have had quite a few insulting comments shouted by motorists in passing cars the fans say local pubs and restaurants have generously allowed them to use their toilets for a nominal payment of one reais (35p) and bathroom facilities to bathe in for five reais (£1.80).

'The police have actually been really nice to us. The other day they bought us pizza and quite a few people have given us food and bottles of water,' says Leais Mates, 19.

'We also bring our own supplies, biscuits and sandwiches and such like,' she adds.

More than 36,000 fans are expected at the concert which is sold out. Many have paid around 350 reais (£100) for their tickets.  

Just before the Mail Online leaves, Beliebers treat us to a high-spirited rendition of ‘Boyfriend’ and declare their undying love for the star.

'I want to send a message to Justin,' shouts Cynthia Castro, 16. 'I can’t wait to see you. I promise I won’t faint when I do. Please marry me!'
