Detectives are investigating the discovery of human remains that had been hidden in the foundations of a pizzeria recently confiscated as part of an operation against the Mafia.

The grim find was made as workmen carried out renovations at the restaurant, which also sits upon the site of an old Roman road.

Sources said the skeleton was found in the cellar of the building which dates back to the 1600s, although the bones appeared to have been from a 'far more recent period'.

Behind the facade: The human remains were found in the foundations of a pizzeria with connections to the mafia in the picturesque town of Lecco, Lake Como

Officers and forensic pathologists were called to the building by shocked workers just days after ornate frescoes were also uncovered at the former pizzeria.

Following the discovery of the artwork at the pizzeria known as Il Giglio in Lecco, near Milan, experts from Italy's superintendency of art were called in to examine the works.

But they will now have to leave as the building is now in the hands of the local police, putting plans to turn it into an old people's home on hold.

It had initially been seized and closed down by anti-mob investigators as part of a crackdown on the Coco Trovato clan, who operate in the area and are part of the Calabrian mafia known as the 'Ndrangheta, who have spread north from their stronghold in the deep south of Italy around the port of Reggio Calabria.

Godfather: Franco Coco Trovato, jailed in 1992, bossed over the Coco Trovato clan which led to the closure of the pizzeria

A police spokesman in Lecco said: 'The building has been sealed off and investigators are on site.

'They will be working to establish exactly how old the skeleton is and if possible try and identify it.

'At this point we are not ruling anything out, especially - given that the property was owned by the 'Ndrangheta - we need to see if there is a possible criminal connection.'

Godfather of the clan was Franco Coco Trovato, 67, who was convicted and jailed in 1992 for life after being found guilty of murder, extortion and drug trafficking.

The clan boss had a fleet of Porsche and Ferrari cars as well as a string of pizzerias and restaurants across Lecco and Milan which were popular with Italian celebrities.

He ruled the area around Lecco with an iron grip, frequently ordering rivals to be executed.  In one hit, six opponents were gunned down while he himself was also targeted but escaped leaving his would-be assassins killing two innocent passers-by instead.

In true mafia style he then invited the rival mobster who had ordered the hit to a 'clear the air dinner' where he was shot dead.

And while he is still in prison, police say his clan still continues to influence the area and he manages to impose his will even from behind prison bars.

The 'Ndrangheta has been growing in influence in northern Italy in recent years and is now said to be more powerful than its better-known Sicilian counterparts, with its fingers deep in the financial and fashion capital of Milan.

Two years ago in a famous show trial dozens of 'Ndrangheta mobsters were sentenced to total jail terms of more than 1,000 years by a Milan judge.

Police say the 'Ndrangheta controls the lucrative drugs supply from South America into Europe and operations to crack it are difficult as there are few informants.

One of the most infamous events including the 'Ndrangheta was the infamous Duisburg Massacre of 2007 when six mobsters were gunned down in a pizzeria in the German city after travelling more than 1,000 miles from Reggio Calabria to settle a long running feud.

The N'drangheta's power has increased in recent years and it dominates the drugs market in Europe especially cocaine with investigators estimating it makes more than £30 billion a year - equivalent to the GDP of Slovenia - and there are also said to be connections in Britain.
