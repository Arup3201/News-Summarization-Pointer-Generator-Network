The encounter with ‘Glint Eastwood’ was meant to be a light-hearted photo opportunity. But Connor May, eight, burst into tears moments after this picture was taken.

Street entertainer Glint – dressed as a cowboy and covered head to toe in golden spray paint – handcuffed the youngster and pointed a toy gun at his head.

The incident left the boy shocked and upset, his mother Laura said yesterday. She called for such entertainers to be licensed.

Connor had been enjoying a day out at a Christmas market with his grandmother, Helen May. 

When Connor dropped £1 in the human statue’s cash collection, Glint ‘sprang to life’ and cuffed Connor to his belt buckle.

He then pressed his golden gun against Connor’s temple as Mrs May, 59, took the picture. 

But, following the incident in Birmingham on Saturday, the schoolboy burst into tears.

He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and suffers panic attacks.

His mother, 31, from Malvern, Worcestershire, who was not present, described the photo as ‘sinister’.

‘I was absolutely horrified,’ she said. ‘Connor was being restrained. Who knows who this man could be? He’s just allowed to stand there with an imitation gun and no-one cares because he’s painted gold.’

She said her son was ‘really shaken up’ and had had flashbacks since.

Helen May, also of Malvern, said: ‘My grandson tried to pretend he was having fun, but he sensed people were looking on horrified. He’s been badly affected by this.’

Birmingham Council said an official would speak to the performer about the incident. 

Glint, meanwhile, has apparently left town.
