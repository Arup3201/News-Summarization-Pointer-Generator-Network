A married internet tycoon brought ‘shame’ on this country by thrusting his groin into a female tourist on a train during the Olympics, a court heard.

Stefan Glaenzer, 51, carried out the assault after travelling from station to  station on the London Underground to ogle at women from behind.

The German-born multi-millionaire, who is the former chairman of internet streaming website Last.fm, told police he had experienced ‘urges’ to assault a woman since his wife gave birth.

Sentenced: Stefan Glaenzer, left, was pictured arriving at court today with his face covered. He admitted sexually assaulting a tourist on a packed Central Line train and was handed a suspended jail term.

Glaenzer, who has three children, added that he embarked on the spree after smoking cannabis.

District Judge Michael Snow told Glaenzer that his victim, an American in her 20s, felt ‘violated’ by the attack.

She had travelled to London especially to see the Olympics and said she would never return to the city.

Judge Snow said: ‘Her memory of her visit has been tarnished. It is to 
this country’s shame that you brought another country’s citizen to that 
frame of mind.

‘She’s extremely angry by what happened to her and I’m sure that in 
addition, she is disgusted and feels violated. Women on the Underground 
are easy prey for men like you.’

Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard Glaenzer was spotted by police 
acting strangely at Oxford Circus Tube station at 5.50pm on August 8.

Prosecutor Jonathan Gold said he ‘seemed to be paying close attention’ 
to some of the women before boarding a Central line train to Bond 
Street.

A plainclothes policeman followed him and saw him standing 
‘unnecessarily’ close to women on two separate trains, and appeared to 
be looking at their backs. On a third train, he stood behind his victim 
and thrust his crotch into her backside twice – leading to his instant 
arrest.

Mr Gold added: ‘He admitted what he had done. He said he had had urges 
to do that since his wife had given birth a couple of months ago.’

Defending, Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC said her client had led an 
‘exemplary life’ and had never been in trouble with the police before.

She added that he had been forced to confess all to his wife, whom he 
lives with in Notting Hill and who has stuck by him during the court 
proceedings.

She said: ‘Due to his foolish choice of smoking cannabis he has behaved in a manner which is wholly out of character.

‘He is and was and remains a very happily married family man.’

Judge Snow gave Glaenzer an eight-week sentence suspended for 18 months 
and ordered him to pay his victim £1,000 in compensation as well as £85 
in court costs.

Glaenzer was also forced to sign the sex offenders’ register for seven 
years and take part in a sexual behaviour rehabilitation programme, with
an 18-month ban on using the Tube.

He was previously fined £265 for possessing cannabis.

Glaenzer spent 15 years as a DJ before he co-founded online auction 
website Ricardo.de. He became chairman of Last.fm in 2004 and sold his 
stake in the website for £22million in 2007. He is also an investor of
Wahanda.com, a health and beauty website.

In 2010, TechCrunch named him as one of Europe’s top investors.
