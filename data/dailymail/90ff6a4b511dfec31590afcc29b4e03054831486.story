A British tourist has gone on trial in Tenerife accused of attacking a couple with a meat cleaver and a knife.

Martin Leonard, 64, from Crossways, Dorset, denies attempting to murder fellow Britons Andrew and Wendy Stewart at the Next Door Bar in the Malibu Park hotel at Playa de las Americas on south coast of the Canary Island in January 2012.

Leonard allegedly slashed Mrs Stewart, leaving her left ear hanging by a thin piece of skin, and wounded Mr Stewart in the shoulder and face.

The defendant, who has been held on the island since his arrest a day after the incident, was a regular winter visitor and had an apartment at the park.

Prosecutors said Leonard became involved in a heated argument with Andrew Stewart and his wife Wendy.

According to witnesses, Leonard was asked to leave the premises after the altercation but returned minutes later, wielding a 7' kitchen knife and a 13' meat cleaver. Without warning, he lashed out wildly at Mr Stewart, slashing him in the head and left shoulder.

Doctors said Mr Stewart suffered a deep wound from the bridge of his nose to his hair line and needed 15 to 20 stitches.

His wife sustained serious facial injuries as she tried to protect her husband and required 21 stitches to sew her ear back on after it was nearly completely sliced off by a blow with the cleaver.

Doctors told the court that the ear was 'hanging on by the skin' when she was admitted to hospital for urgent treatment.

A third person, Lynn Gilliard, who was working in the bar that night, had tendons severed in three fingers of her right hand as she stepped in to protect Mrs Stewart.

The court heard that Leonard was eventually restrained by father-of-two Paul Matthews, a former car salesman from Stourbridge who was on holiday in Tenerife at the time.  

Leonard appeared in court wearing a blue tracksuit top, checked shirt and black trousers and walked with the aid of a crutch. 

Mr Stewart described how he was having a quiet drink on his night off work with his wife when Leonard, who was a complete stranger to the couple, approached them and engaged in conversation.  

His wife Wendy told the court that she saw Leonard approach Mr Stewart and then strike him with the cleaver before turning to attack her.

She said: 'My ear was nearly chopped off and, just as he tried to hit me again, my friend Lynn stepped in and was cut badly when she put her hand in the way to protect me'.

Lynn Gilliard described how she had ordered Leonard out of the bar after the initial argument and saw him return a short time later.

She said: 'I don't think he was using the knives to intimidate. For me, he wanted to kill.'

Ms Gilliard added that she has partially lost the use of her right index finger as a result of the attack and admits to suffering 'nightmares and insomnia' since the incident.

In his opening statement to the court, Leonard - who acknowledged that the two large knives had 'probably come' from his apartment - admitted causing bodily harm but pleaded not guilty to the attempted murders of Mr and Mrs Stewart.

When pressed by the judges as to why he was now admitting guilt, he said: 'It is clear that three people were injured and I was responsible, although I remember nothing about it. I must be guilty even if I don't remember.' 

The trial was adjourned until November 13, when psychiatric reports on the defendant will be presented by the defence.

If convicted, Leonard faces a total jail term of 22 years on two charges of attempted murder and one of causing serious bodily harm.

The case continues.
