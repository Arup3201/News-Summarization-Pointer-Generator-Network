Brentford are considering the shock step of replacing manager Mark Warburton.

Warburton, who is out of contract in the summer, won promotion from League One last season and has guided them to fourth in the Championship with a crucial game against sixth placed Watford on Tuesday night.

However, reports emanating from Spain last week say that Brentford have earmarked Rayo Vallecano's highly-rated Paco Jemez as the man to replace Warburton at the end of the season.

Intermediaries claiming to represent Brentford have approached the former Spain international sounding out his availability, while Warburton insists that he understands 'the club have to plan for any eventuality.' 

Jemez has plenty of interest and is intrigued by the Brentford project but is keen to take another post in Spain.

Warburton, 52, a former defender at Leicester City, has caught the eye of other clubs also with his work at Brentford and it is understood the Griffin Park club is covering all bases by sounding out other options. 

A club statement read: 'The Club is aware of some press speculation about the future of our Manager, Mark Warburton.

'Given Mark’s increasing profile within the game, we recognise that he will deservedly have turned the heads of other clubs.' 

Warburton said: 'My only focus is on the team and the match tonight [Tuesday]. I'm disappointed that the focus is on all this rather than the game. We are in a good position with 17 games to go.

'The team have done well and I understand the club have to plan for any eventuality, it is a very forward-thinking club. But my only focus is a big game.'

The Brentford statement continued: 'As with every other sensibly run club, we plan for various possible eventualities.

'We are a progressive club who do talk to other people within the game to learn about other ways of doing things, and to consider novel strategic approaches to the game.

'Those conversations continue internally, and are part of a healthy dialogue.

'Football is sometimes called a village, and in any village, gossip and rumours can spread like wildfire, whether or not such rumours are true.

'It would not be in the Club’s interests to disclose any of those discussions, but Brentford FC do want to confirm that Mark Warburton remains our manager.

'The team’s performance has been magnificent this season and that is primarily down to Mark’s leadership.

'Mark will continue to lead the club in its push for Premier League football.

'At this critical stage of the season, we don’t propose to make any further statements in relation to these rumours.'
