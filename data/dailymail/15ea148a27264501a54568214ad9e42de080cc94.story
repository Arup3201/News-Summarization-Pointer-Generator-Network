At the venerable age of 93, the world's fittest pensioner is gearing up for three international fitness championships this year.

London-born Charles Eugster, who confesses he is 'very vain', took up running and rowing at the age of 85, when he noticed he was putting on weight.

He will tackle the World Masters Rowing Regatta in Italy, 
the World Masters Athletics Championships in Brazil and the European 
Strenflex Championships in Switzerland.

Charles, an energetic body builder and rower, will be the first person ever to enter all three challenges at his age.

The retired dentist joined a body-building club and began three intense workouts a week aged 89 - then decided to push it up a gear with the help of a personal trainer.

Grandfather-of-two Charles, who lives in Uitikon, Switzerland, said his next goal will be to have a beach body at the age of 94.

He said: 'My main motivation to start was because I was losing muscle mass, my body was deteriorating and I was very vain.'

'I wanted to turn the heads of the sexy 70-year-old girls on the beach.'

'I've never done athletics before, it was something new. You can start something new at any age, it doesn't matter how old you are.'

Charles will compete at the World Masters Rowing Regatta in September in Varese, Italy.

Then he will tackle the 
World Masters Athletics Championships in October in Porto Alegre, Brazil
- 50m freestyle swimming, 100m sprint, shot put and discus.

Charles, who was born in 1919, began a grueling workout regime at the age of 85 and became a fitness ambassador for a gym chain five years later.

He lost almost two stone in the first year of working out and is kept on track by his personal trainer.

They continuously experiment with different training regimes, diet and natural food supplements.Charles
added: 'There is very little information about training methods or diets 
for the healthy aged above 70. This means we are exploring
an unknown field.'

Taking up sport at 85: Charles Eugster says he wants to get 'a new body and a new life'

'What we have planned for this year is something new, we want to see if I can take part in an athletic competition, the World Masters in Athletics.'

'We are trying to train me for 100m running, something I have never done before. I might consider swimming. If I can develop my swimming technique I will also try to take part in a men's international competition.'

'The secrets of healthy old living are three factors. One is work and the other is nutrition and the third is exercise in that order. What I hope to achieve is to change the world. Get a new body and start a new life.'

In 2008, he won the World Strenflex Decathlon Championships in the 80+ category, as their oldest contestant.

A year later, Charles won the Van Der Merwe Cup, an international fitness decathlon in Switzerland, with the highest number of points scored in any age group.

In 2009 he was crowned Strenflex Swiss Champion, and in 2010 he racked up the highest number of points in a Strenflex competition.
