An anti-ISIS rebel commander in Syria gave a rousing speech to his assembled men standing behind a Hello Kitty note pad.Â 

The leader, named on the YouTube video as Zahran Alloush implored his men to fight the 'evil ideology' of ISIS accusing them of trying to 'destroy jihad in Syria'.

The video shows Alloush addressing up to 100 fighters on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus.

Zahran Alloush looks every inch a Syrian rebel commander as he stands, wearing desert camouflage fatigues, in front of his band of rebel fighters with a semi-automatic handgun strapped to his side

However, Alloush's martial image is somewhat diminished by the Hello Kitty notepad, circled, on his desk

Alloush warned his fighters of the dangers posed by ISIS accusing them of trying 'to destroy jihad in Syria'

ISIS, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had earlier called a 'caliphate' in parts of Syria and Iraq in a further bid to destabilise the troubled region.

Alloush branded ISIS as 'khawarij', which is a term for a group of people who have rebelled against the acknowledged Muslim ruler.

According to a note attached to the YouTube video, Alloush told his fighters: 'This group of khawarij, the gang of [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi ... tried to destroy jihad in Afghanistan, in Chechnya, in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Iraq. They have now come to try and destroy jihad in Syria.'

He then warned his men over the threat posed by ISIS, using the example of the killing of Abul Miqdam: 'They forced him to the ground and slit his throat.'

Alloush also criticised the number of non-Syrians fighting with ISIS accusing them of having little regard for civilians.

He added: 'They are dirty b*******, with an evil ideology.'

Meanwhile, 30 ISIS fighters broke out of a makeshift jail where they were being held by rival Syrian Islamists, it has emerged.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed heavy fighting in the village of al-Hawaaj.

ISIS, which has declared a caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq, includes thousands of foreign fighters and has become the main recruiting magnet for jihadi volunteers from Europe and North Africa. The Observatory said the 30 fighters that escaped on Friday were all Syrian.

The group is now considered the most potent insurgent band in Syria and its rivals complain that it spends more time fighting them than Syrian army forces.

It also captured the villages of Quniya and Buqris in the Deir al-Zor province from Nusra late on Thursday, the Observatory said. The villages are close to the town of Mayadin, which ISIS seized earlier in the day.

It is claimed that ISIS now controls an area five times larger than neighbouring Lebanon.
