It depicts an old-fashioned world where love and courtship were steeped in tradition, men were noble and there was a belief that British resolve and a stiff upper lip would lead to a brighter future.

And for the many millions who watch the show avidly, it is this mix that is the key to Downton Abbey’s success.

Rather than the perils of social networking and online dating that so many face today, women in particular delight in being transported to a more orderly time when social etiquette was clearly defined.

Many find themselves drawn to archetypal Edwardian men such as the valet John Bates, played by Brendan Coyle, described as a ‘devoted alpha male’ who sets a ‘wonderful example of how you should treat the ones you love’, experts said yesterday.

In their analysis of the drama’s appeal, they also cite the ordered and elegant world of the post-Edwardian era as a huge draw.

They say it contrasts with the  uncertainty of life in modern Britain but like the Abbey’s inhabitants, we believe that if we soldier on we will eventually turn a corner for the better. 

Naomi Carle, literature tutor at Durham University and co-founder of the Edwardian Culture Network, drew parallels between the Downton age and Britain’s past few years.

‘Britain has had its garden party moments: the Royal marriage, the Jubilee and the Olympics,’ she said.

‘But there’s also been continuing hardship, the 2011 riots, trade unions back in the news and cultural commentators talking of a national identity crisis. 

‘In these uncertain times, people take comfort from the fact that Downton shows how the Edwardian era helped to create a better world despite the struggle and conflict.

‘It shows that we have to keep on plugging away. You can see it in the stoicism we’ve shown in the face of the recession. For several years now, there’s been no real improvement in our lives, but, like Downton’s characters, we believe that good old British resolve and a dose of the stiff upper lip will lead us to a brighter future.’

Jacqui Meddings, entertainment editor of Cosmopolitan, described Downton as ‘pure escapism’.

‘If the emails and tweets we receive every Sunday evening are anything to go by, life at Downton definitely appeals to the modern woman,’ she wrote in Reader’s Digest.

‘Men are gentlemen, relationships are openly romantic and everyone dresses beautifully for dinner. What’s not to like?

‘What’s really interesting is how women react to archetypal Edwardian men like the valet Mr Bates.

‘Even in 2013, we’re hard-wired to be attracted to that kind of noble, charming, devoted alpha male.

‘Mr Bates sets a wonderful example of how you should treat the ones you love.’

The first episode of Downton Abbey’s fourth series will be shown at 9pm on ITV1 on September 22.
