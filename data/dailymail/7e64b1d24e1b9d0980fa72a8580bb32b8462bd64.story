Speculation is mounting that giant panda Tian Tian is pregnant after staff at Edinburgh Zoo confirmed they were 'pretty sure' she is expecting.

Tian Tian was artificially inseminated with samples from the zoo’s male panda, Yang Guang, in April, after introductions between the pair were attempted but unsuccessful.

Keepers have been raising hopes that it will be third time lucky after the couple failed to mate in 2012 and Tian Tian lost a foetus late in pregnancy in 2013.

Although she has conceived, her pregnancy is not yet certain as fertilised giant panda eggs do not immediately implant on the mother’s uterine wall - but instead 'float' around in the reproductive tract for varying lengths of time.

But urine tests have revealed she has successfully conceived, which means a major hurdle has been cleared in the zoo’s bid to add to its panda family.

And if the embryo has successfully implanted into Tian-Tian’s womb, a baby panda could arrive as early as next month.

If successful it will make history as the first baby giant panda born in the UK. However, keepers will not know for sure until just before the panda gives birth.

lain Valentine, director of Giant Pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, hoped pregnancy would begin in 20 to 30 days.

'A technique called a CP test - ceruloplasmin to give it the proper name - was performed using urine samples at seven to ten days after artificial insemination in April and this indicates that Tian Tian has conceived.'

Mr Valentine said: 'It is important to stress that this test tells us only that she has conceived, not that implantation has occurred, as pandas practise delayed implantation.

'After this, if successful, Tian Tian would give birth roughly around late August.

'At this stage the embryo is still in diapause or rest, so technically pregnancy has not occurred yet.

'There are many more significant developments still to happen. Tian Tian is in great health - very relaxed, at a great weight and eating well and keepers and scientists continue to monitor her.'

Panda expert Jeroen Jacobs said the positive test was 'a good thing', and made a pregnancy more likely.

He said: 'She has conceived, but that doesn’t mean it’s sure that she is pregnant.

'It’s
 always a wait until the final minute, so it’s not certain that 
something will happen this summer in Edinburgh - but it makes it 
possible. It’s already a good thing, but it’s still early.'

The
 artificial insemination was carried out in April and pregnancy would be
 expected to come to term in late August or early September.

Keepers will now be looking for signs of changed behaviour in Tian-Tian, particularly in terms of how she is nesting.

Giant
 panda Tian Tian, which means Sweetie, and Yang Guang, which means 
Sunshine, became the first to live at a UK zoo in 17 years when they 
arrived in December 2011.

Both pandas are currently ten years old and on loan from China until 2021.

A zoo spokeswoman added: 'There is no definitive information, but we are obviously very hopeful for it.'

Zookeepers will now be on the lookout for signs of a change in behaviour for Tian Tian, particularly in how she is nesting. Pictured is Tian Tian during last year's winter before her first failed pregnancy attempt

However the species' biological trait of 'delayed implantation' means total certainty of pregnancy still not possible
