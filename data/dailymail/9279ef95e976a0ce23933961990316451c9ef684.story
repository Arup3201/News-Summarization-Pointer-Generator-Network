Grief stricken family members of British schoolgirl Imani Green, who was shot dead in a Jamaican grocery store, broke down at her funeral yesterday.

Eight-year-old Imani was murdered earlier this month when she was caught in the cross-fire of what police believe to be a turf war over an illegal lottery scam.

Her distraught father Richard Green, 38, had flown in from London for the 
funeral and was seen crying on a wall outside afterwards while family 
members comforted each other.

A 150-strong crowd of Imani's family and friends packed into a memorial service for the sickle cell sufferer in the town of Falmouth in Jamaica's north.Â 

The youngsters body was brought into the church in a pink and white casket for the funeral which was also attended by Imani's mother Donna, her siblings Jamila and Dean Palmer and her grandmother Sandra Fisher.

Her mother is expected to fly her ashes back to the UK to be buried.

One attendee, who wouldn't be named, said: 'Everyone was crying and sobbing, it was very sad.

'People couldn't hold back their grief
as the pastor spoke, saying how Imani had been so full of life and such
a happy girl. She was always willing to hep anyone and loved to be 
around people.'

Imani's grandmother Mrs Fisher, 54, said: 'It was so, so 
hard. I couldn't get up and say anything at the service. I wish I had 
the strength to stand up and talk but I just couldn't.

'Donna felt the same, it was just too difficult.

'We had invited all of our friends so everyone who loved Imani could say goodbye to her.'

Among those who paid tribute to Imani during the service was a woman police officer, while the congregation sang hymns including 'Jesus Loves Me'.

Imani was shot dead on January 11 when a masked gunman burst into the family's roadside cafe in Trelawny, northwest Jamaica, and opened fire.

The Tooting schoolgirl was shot in the head and shoulder and died in hospital.

Gunned down: Imani green, was murdered while on holiday with her family in Jamaica

Police suspect it may have been a revenge attack for a December shooting linked to a lucrative telemarketing operation which scams Americans by convincing them to hand over cash to collect bogus lottery winnings.

Criminal gangs who collect the large sums of money are said to be locked in a feud which has recently erupted with deadly consequences.

In the aftermath of Imani's death, police arrested eight local men and quizzed them but all have since been released.

The murder investigation took on a fresh twist when a local man was shot dead in a broad daylight attack half a mile from Imani's death scene just three days later.

Detectives say they have no one in custody for Imani's death but stress that their investigation is progressing.

Imani had been given special permission from teachers to travel to Jamaica with her mother and sister just after Christmas.

The sunshine holiday was also meant to help ease the constant pain of her genetic blood disorder in the warmer climate.
