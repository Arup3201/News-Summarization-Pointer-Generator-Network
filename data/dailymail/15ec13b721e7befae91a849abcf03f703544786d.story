A brain-damaged 17-month-old boy has died days after a High Court judge ruled that he should be taken off a life support machine against his family's wishes.

The little boy had been born prematurely by emergency Caesarean section in 'poor condition' and was cared for at a hospital run by King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London.

He also suffered a cardiac arrest lasting for about 20 minutes and needed resuscitation.

Ms Justice Russell ruled last week that it was in his best interests for 'life-sustaining intensive care' to be withdrawn as he was suffering from 'profound irreversible brain damage'.

A lawyer who represents the little boy's mother and father said his death had left them devastated.

Yogi Amin, who works for law firm Irwin Mitchell, said: 'The family are of course devastated to have lost a precious life in their family and have asked for privacy at this incredibly difficult time to grieve for their son.'

Ms Justice Russell had said there had been 'multiple failures' at one stage of the little boy's care, during the hearing at the Family Division of the High Court in London.

Claire Watson, representing the trust, said in late 2013 he had suffered an 'acute cardio-respiratory deterioration' which required him to be 'mechanically ventilated once again'.

She had also indicated that something had 'gone wrong' - but had not given detail. 

The NHS Trust had asked the judge to rule that life-support treatment could be withdrawn

Michael Marrinan, the trust's executive medical director, today said he was sorry that an agreement about the 'best course of action' had not been reached.

'Decisions about what is best for patients in circumstances such as this are always difficult,' he said.

'This baby spent his whole life in our intensive care unit and after a long period of assessment by our doctors and independent experts, we determined that he did not have hope of improving.

'We are sorry that we could not reach an agreement with his parents about the best course of action to take.

'We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to his parents for the loss of their son.'

Ms Watson had told the court that an investigation had been carried out and said the 'trust have endeavoured to be entirely transparent about what has gone wrong'.

The judge accepted that the trust had been 'transparent' and 'has not tried to cover anything up'.

But she said what had happened had 'affected the way his parents feel about his treatment - as it would'. 

The boy cannot be named for legal reasons.
