Zlatan Ibrahimovic looked far from happy as he stepped off the PSG team coach after they arrived in Marrakesh on Saturday.

The 33-year-old has been in impressive form for the French champions so far this season, finding the net on 12 occasions already. 

But the maverick forward looked as though he would rather be anywhere but Marrakesh, as he and his team-mates prepare for the second part of the 2014/15 season with a friendly against his former side Italian giants Inter Milan next Tuesday.

With a three-week winter break in place in France, as well as many other countries, PSG chose Morocco as their training camp this year.

And the match against Inter will provide them with a stiff test, ahead of a busy January schedule where they play six games in the entirety of the month.

Laurent Blanc's side will be hoping to be celebrating another league title come May, with them currently sitting third in Ligue 1 - three points behind the current leaders Marseille.

After the match against Roberto Mancini's Inter side, they face  Montpellier in the last 32 of the French Cup before a trip to Bastia in the league on January 10.
