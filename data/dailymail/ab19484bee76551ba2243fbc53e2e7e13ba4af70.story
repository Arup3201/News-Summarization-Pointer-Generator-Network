Police have released an image of a man in a tweed cap and jacket who they believe, with an Asian woman, helped dupe a 59-year-old dementia sufferer out of £10,000 in a fake lottery scam

A couple conned a man with dementia into handing over £10,000 after a woman said she had won the lottery but was unable to claim her prize.

The 59-year-old man was approached by an Asian woman in Birmingham who told him she had won the jackpot, but was unable to claim it because she was an illegal immigrant. 

After she asked him for directions they were joined by another man who suggested they could help the woman by buying her ticket. 

The couple then took the dementia sufferer to get his details and to a bank and watched him withdraw £10,000 before driving off. 

West Midlands Police have released an image of a man they believed helped dupe the 59-year-old into emptying his bank account. 

They said the pair preyed on him because of his vulnerability.

The woman had approached the man in the Jewellery Quarter of Birmingham and told him about the fake win before asking for directions to the nearest solicitors on October 24.

When the second man approached he claimed to have simply overheard their conversation and suggested they give her £10,000 in exchange for the supposed winning ticket. 

The pair then took him to his home in Edgbaston, collected his bank details. 

They then escorted him to the nearest bank to withdraw the cash.

Detective Constable Michelle Hunt said: 'This has left the victim and his family devastated.

'These two suspects have picked on the victim because of his vulnerability.

'They made up the story to deceive him and take advantage of his good nature.

'They have been driven by greed to take these extraordinary steps and steal a large amount of money.

'We are keen to trace the pair and urge anyone who recognises the man captured on CCTV, or the descriptions given, to contact us as soon as possible.'

The 59-year-old, dressed in a blue headdress, is seen at his home in Edgbaston escorted by the Asian man 

CCTV images show the victim, dressed in a blue head dress at his home. Footage also captured an image of the man who is suspected of helping to dupe him, wearing a light tweed jacket with a distinctive flat cap and dark rimmed glasses.

Officers said the conman, who was in his late 40s to 50s and Asian, was around 5ft 7ins tall and was also wearing dark trousers and a pale shirt with a brown tie and black shoes.

His partner was described as the same age and height and was wearing traditional Asian female clothing.
