A wartime bomber hero was today celebrating 70 years of marriage to the radio operator whose voice he fell in love with as she guided him home from a bombing mission over Germany.

Flt Lt Steve Stevens, 91, first heard Maureen's calming voice as she guided him back to RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire following the mission in 1943.

The 21-year-old Lancaster pilot was so intrigued by hearing a female's voice from the tower, he went to have a look after landing.

Steve and Maureen Stevens were today celebrating 70 years of marriage (left) after they first met as she guided the former RAF pilot home from a bombing mission over Germany. The couple were married (right) eight months after he plucked up the courage to ask her out

But he 'crept away' again after seeing 'this glamorous girl sitting in the middle of a crowd of people, the centre of attention'.

However, the Bomber Command airman, who went on to win the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), eventually plucked up the courage to ask WAAF girl Maureen Miller out.

They got married in her home city of Norwich eight months later at the height of the Second World War.

Mrs Stevens said: 'Steve first fell in love with my voice. They loved to hear my voice, and I loved to hear theirs.

The couple point to Mr Steven's flying logbook entry which shows the flight he was on when they very first talked over the radio, an official transmission that led to their long marriage

'The first time I went into a control tower I was petrified. I had never been near an aircraft before.

'Then,
 my first night on duty, a plane took off and went up in flames. I went 
racing down the stairs, I just wanted to get out, but the man in charge 
pointed to my seat and said, "Miller! Your place is there".

'So I came back and sat down.'

By the time the couple tied the knot Mrs Stevens had played a pivotal part in the Dambuster raid, talking the returning crews back to land after their mission in Germany.

Led by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, the 
617 Squadron shattered the Moehne and Eder dams with Barnes Wallis's 
bouncing bombs - sending floodwater raging through the Ruhr Valley.

The story of Steve and Maureen Stevens bears a resemblance, in part, to the 1946 film A Matter Of Life And Death.

The film, set in England during the Second World War, sees Squadron Leader Peter Carter, played by David Niven, as a British Air Force pilot who orders the crew of his burning Lancaster bomber to bail without telling them his parachute has been shot up.

He manages to speak to English-based American radio operator June, played by Kim Hunter, for a few minutes before jumping, without a parachute.

After miraculously surviving the fall he ends up meeting June and they fall in love. But a celestial court is set up to determine the afterlife's claim on him.

Through
 the dawn of May 17, 1943, and for hours afterwards, Mrs Stevens sat 
listening in the desperate hope that more men would make it home.

Eight
 of the 19 Lancasters which took off from RAF Scampton that night did 
not return and 53 of the 133 aircrew involved were killed, a casualty 
rate of almost 40 per cent.

Mr Stevens, who was in 57 Squadron, had to wait in his bomber on the airfield before taking off on his own test sortie that night as the elite Dambuster boys soared up into the black sky.

Today the couple still live in the Norwich semi-detached house they moved into more than 60 years ago.

Mr Stevens, who will be 92 later this month while his wife will be 94, failed to turn up to their first date after he was scrambled to go on another raid - and had forgotten to ask for her name.

It was only when he heard her voice on his radio a second time, from a different base, that he persuaded her to give him another chance.

Within weeks he had proposed.

Mrs Stevens said: 'I think it went something like, "If I'm alive at the end of the year, we'll get married".

'I wasn't the marrying kind. I didn't want to get married. I was the youngest of seven and had four older sisters and I used to say I didn't want to be like them and spend my life with one person.

'But I remember thinking, very early on, that he'd make someone a good husband.'

Soon afterwards she was always listening out for one voice in particular while on duty in the control tower.

Mr Stevens, pictured stood beside a Wellington bomber during the war, flew 30 raids and said he did not expect to survive the war

She said: 'I still remember the time his plane came in late.

'The control tower officer was worried, but I said, "He'll be all right". And he was.'

Mrs Stevens had been working as a proofreader when she volunteered for war work.

She said: 'I thought I would be doing some sort of clerical work.

'But in the interview they kept me talking for a long time and then said they had something different for me.'

She was trained as a radio telephone operator and her voice welcomed pilots home after countless raids.

Mr Stevens, who grew up in Devon, became a pilot after his family home, after they had relocated to London, was bombed.

On the night of May 23, 1943, he flew his first trip as a Lancaster captain.

In November 1943, just days before his wedding, Flt Lt Stevens shook hands with King George VI as the monarch awarded him the coveted DFC.

He flew 30 raids and said he did not expect to survive the war.

But he carried on flying for the RAF after the war and took part in the Berlin Airlift in 1948 as Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin tried to cut off the German city.

He also trained as a teacher and taught maths at schools across Norwich, including the Norman, Avenue and Earlham schools.

After her war service Mrs Stevens worked as a secretary for Colman's for 30 years and Mr Stevens was president of the Lakenham branch of the British Legion for 25 years.

Their son Adrian studied at Cambridge and became a university lecturer, specialising in medieval French and German.

He and his wife Janey returned to Norwich this week to help celebrate his parents' platinum anniversary.
