A three-year-old Utah boy has been killed after an allegedly drunk driving illegal immigrant rear-ended his family's car while it was stopped at a red light, causing a five-vehicle pile up.

Zane Thurber, who was strapped into his car-seat in the back of his dad Matt's Subaru, died instantly in the horrific collision that occurred at a Taylorsville intersection around 8:30 p.m. Saturday.

Witnesses said Manuel de Jesus Guinea, 55, was driving at about 70 mph shortly before he slammed into the Thurbers vehicle, and 'smelled like a bar' as he attempted to blend in with the crowd. Onlookers managed to hold him until officers arrived.

Because of his immigration status, Zane's family believe Guinea, who is originally from El Salvador, does not have any insurance and fear they will be unable to pay for his funeral and medical costs.

Distraught: 'It's a senseless, senseless crime,' said Zane's devastated father Matt Thurber

'It's a senseless, senseless crime,' the devastated father told The Salt Lake Tribune, where he's employed as a sports clerk.

Guinea was arrested at the scene on suspicion of automobile homicide and driving under the influence.

Jail booking records also show there is an immigration hold on Guinea, who was being held at the Salt Lake County jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.

This means that when local authorities are finished with him, he will be taken into the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which can deport him.

Fearing that, as an illegal immigrant, he doesn't have auto insurance, relatives set up a fund at YouCaring.com, where more than $22,000 has already been raised for little Zane's funeral and any medical costs.

In addition to Zane's death, the 
crash caused Matt Thurber to suffer a concussion, and knocked his 
6-year-old son Holden's tooth out.

'It was just, very, very painful. I 
[have been] rear-ended before, but it was nothing like this. It was the 
most jolting feeling I've ever had,' Thurber said.

He said the airbags blew and he heard Holden scream for his brother.

'I was hoping that he was just knocked out, unconscious,' Thurber told the Tribune.

The dad only learned Zane was dead after arriving at Intermountain Medical Center for his own injuries.

Still in shock Monday, Thurber and his wife Aubrie described Zane was an adventurous, outgoing boy who crammed a lot of life into the three years he had.

He loved playing Peek-A-Boo, swimming and had 'a real strong connection' with his mom, Thurber said.

Unified Police Lt. Justin Hoyal said 
it isn't yet known for sure how fast the driver was traveling prior to 
crashing into Thurber's vehicle.

Investigators are reconstructing the 
scene to better determine what happened.

Witnesses told police Guinea was weaving in and out of traffic and his break lights weren't visible prior to the crash.

'The individual had been driving recklessly west bound on 5400 South, and there were actually citizens in the process of calling 911 to report that reckless driving,' Hoyal said earlier.

Authorities are still determining the Guinea's exact blood alcohol level at the time of the crash.

In an interview with Deseret News Monday, Thurber recalled the last time he played with his son on what had been a 'perfect day.'

'We bonded so close. I took him to McDonald's and he was in the play pen and I saw him in a spaceship. He was on his last run and he waved goodbye. Then, hours later, he was gone,' the father said.

Thurber used the harrowing experience to press the message not to drink and drive.

'If you want to have a few drinks, please stay home, get a designated driver â€” but this guy was way out of control and it's not fair. It's sad and it's going to affect our family for a very long time,' he told the Deseret News.
