If she really wanted to impress the judges she knew she couldn't just rely on her salsa.

So Fern Britton decided to try a little va-va-voom instead.

And judging from the look on Len Goodman's face, it didn't do her any harm.

Take that judges! A confident Fern Britton strips off to reveal skimpiest dress yet

If you've got it, flaunt it! The newly trim Fern with partner Artem

Fern, 55, started her routine onÂ  Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday in a frumpy cleaner's overall.

But she soon stripped off before the astonished judges to reveal her skimpiest outfit yet.

Her fringed mini-dress showed off a newly toned figure, honed by hours of rehearsals for the BBC1 show, before she and partner Artem Chigvintsev, 30, whirled into a steamy salsa to Gloria Estefan's You'll be Mine.

But their performance was not enough to save them from being voted off the dancefloor on last night's results show.

Fern bowed out graciously, saying she had enjoyed every moment of 'the best party on the television'.

After the judges' score, which placed her second from bottom, was combined with the viewers' vote, Fern had to face the dreaded dance-off against Kimberley Walsh.

Hit: The elimination was watched by Strictly's biggest audience of the series so far

The judges voted unanimously to save the Girls Aloud singer sending Fern home, with Craig Revel-Horwood describing the choice as a 'no brainer'.

'I'm thrilled to have been part of it,' she said. 'My ticket on the train has run out.

'Artem, I've loved it. I wouldn't have swapped you for anything. There have been highs and lows, we've got to know each other pretty well, and I do adore you.'

At the top of the leader board on Saturday night was presenter Denise Van Outen and her dance partner James Jordan. After dancing the paso doble she scored 36 out of 40, the highest score of the series so far.

However bookmaker William Hill is making gymnast Louis Smith odds-on favourite to win the series.

Her elimination came as Strictly landed its biggest audience of the series so far as it continued to stomp on The X Factor with two million more viewers.

The BBC1 show drew 10.4 million viewers on Saturday night as its ITV1 rival only managed an average of 8.4 million, even including viewers on its ITV1+1 catch-up channel.
