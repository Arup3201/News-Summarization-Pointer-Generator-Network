Mrs Pushkar Tharoor appeared to detail an affair, but a statement later said the tweets were unauthorised and her marriage was a happy one

The wife of an Indian government minister has been found dead in her room at a luxury New Delhi hotel following reports she had hacked into her husband's Twitter account and published a series of romantic messages between him and a Pakistani journalist.

The body of Sunanda Pushkar Tharoor, 52, was discovered by her husband Shashi Tharoor who was called after cleaners were unable to get inside the room at the plush Leela Palace hotel.

Mr Tharoor's personal assistant Abhinav Kumar told reporters: 'She was lying in bed. There were no signs of any foul play or any struggle. She had no sign of poisoning or anything'.

Mr Kumar said Mr Tharoor returned to the hotel at 8.30 pm and had to have the door opened by hotel authorities. He discovered his wife lying on the bed.

He had initially thought his wife was asleep but when he went to check on her, he found that she was dead.

Mr Tharoor was being questioned by police late on Friday night.

Her death comes just one day after she and her husband released a joint statement on Facebook claiming they were still happily married and intended to stay together.

Mrs Pushkar Tharoor, had reportedly hacked the Twitter account of her husband, who is India's junior human resources minister, and published romantic messages apparently between him and journalist Mehr Tarar to his two million followers.

Mr Tharoor, known as 'Minister 
Twitter' for his love of the social messaging site - was left acutely 
embarrassed after the messages appeared on his feed.

They
 suggested to his more than two million followers that he was in the 
throes of a passionate affair with Ms Tarar, a high profile 
journalist.

Mr Tharoor, 57, quickly deleted the tweets, 
denying he had been having an affair and claiming his account had been 'hacked'.

But Mrs Pushkar Tharoor subsequently told two Indian newspapers that she had published 
the private messages between him and Ms Tarar.

Ms Tarar has posted a tribute to Pushkar 
on Twitter saying: 'I just woke up and read this. I'm absolutely 
shocked. This is too awful for words. So tragic I don't know what to 
say. Rest in peace,Sunanda.'

One
of the incriminating messages, which appeared to have been sent directly from Ms Tarar's 
account, said: 'I love you, Shashi Tharoor. And I go while in love with 
you, irrevocably, irreversibly, hamesha [always]. Bleeding, but always 
your Mehr.'

Ms Tarar strongly denied 
sending the messages and any suggestion that she was in a relationship 
with Mr Tharoor.

But Mrs Pushkar Tharoor had told India's Economic Times newspaper that she had published the tweets to show the world how Ms Tarar was 'stalking' her husband.

As the story unfolded, Sunada Pushkar, Shashi Tharoor and Mehr Tarar all took to Twitter

Denial: Mehr Tarar's Tweets

She
 said: 'Our accounts have not been hacked and I have been sending out 
these tweets. I cannot tolerate this. This is a Pakistani woman who is 
an ISI (Inter Services Intelligence) agent, and she is stalking my 
husband.

'And you know how men are. He is flattered by the attention.'

Mrs Tharoor had been quoted by The Indian Express as
 saying that she would seek a divorce after learning that her husband 
and Ms Tarar had been having a 'rip-roaring affair' since April, which 
had left her feeling 'destroyed as a wife and a woman'.'I completely stand by my tweets, 100 per cent stand by that,' she told the paper.

'That
 woman pursued and pursued him .. men are stupid anyways ... for all you
 know she is a Pakistani agent. Where’s love, where’s loyalty in this 
world ... I am so distraught.'

Mrs Pushkar Tharoor, who has a teenage son and 
divided her time between Dubai, where she runs a business, and Delhi, 
was undergoing medical treatment, something both she and her husband had
 tweeted about.

Yesterday the Tharoors released a joint statement on Facebook
 denying that they are planning to split.

'We
 are distressed by the unseemly controversy that has arisen about some 
unauthorised tweets from our Twitter accounts,' the statement said.

'Various
 distorted accounts of comments allegedly made by Sunanda have appeared 
in the press.

'It appears that some personal and private comments 
responding to these unauthorised tweets -- comments that were not 
intended for publication -- have been misrepresented and led to some 
erroneous conclusions.

'We 
wish to stress that we are happily married and intend to remain that 
way. Sunanda has been ill and hospitalised this week and is seeking to 
rest. We would be grateful if the media respects our privacy.'

Mrs Tharoor's claims were strenuously denied by Ms Tarar, who is a columnist for Lahore's Daily Times newspaper.

In a statement given to India's NDTV
 channel, she said: 'In her tweets, she has accused me both of stalking 
him and of having an affair with him. How can it be both?

'It just shows there are wild allegations. Her tweets to me are so crazy that all I can do is laugh.

'Maybe
 she took offense to the fact that I have praised him so much. But I am 
very transparent - anything that I have said is on my Twitter timeline, 
for the whole world to see.'

Ms
 Tarar interviewed Mr Tharoor in New Delhi last April, after which she 
wrote a flattering profile in which she described him as 'strikingly 
good looking' with a 'powerful, deep and sensuous' voice.

Mr Tharoor is a former UN diplomat who was once touted as a future secretary general.
