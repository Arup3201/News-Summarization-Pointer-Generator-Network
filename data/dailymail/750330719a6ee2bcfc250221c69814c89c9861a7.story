The lesbian boss of an animal charity has been accused of sacking a senior director after he started a relationship with her bisexual lover.

Blue Cross chief executive Kim Hamilton faces claims she forced out the head of fundraising after finding out he was in a relationship with secretary Melanie Brown.

Mike Crossley, 52, was paid £60,000 to leave the charity and sign a gagging clause to stop him from talking about the reasons.

Accused: Kim Hamilton, 53, earns £120,000 as chief executive of Blue Cross. She has been accused of sacking senior director Mike Crossley, 52, after he started a relationship with her bisexual lover, Melanie Brown

Relationship: Mr Crossley (left) was paid £60,000 to leave the charity and sign a gagging clause. Eight months later, 27-year-old Miss Brown (right), who had previously suffered mental health problems, committed suicide 

Eight months later Miss Brown, 27, who had previously suffered from mental health problems, committed suicide.

In
 2012 Miss Hamilton, 53, who earns £120,000, started a secret 
relationship with Miss Brown who was an administrative assistant at the 
charity’s HQ in Burford, Oxfordshire.

Miss
 Hamilton, a former City trader who joined Blue Cross in 2008, never 
openly admitted the relationship but Miss Brown is understood to have 
told colleagues.

Six months
 later Miss Brown ended the relationship and started seeing Mr Crossley.
 He was then sacked from his £80,000-a-year job.

A source with knowledge of the dismissal said: ‘Kim told Mike that he was in a relationship with a vulnerable person at work, and that it was inappropriate so he had to go.

‘His departure was a direct result of his relationship with Mel. It was an entirely personal thing. But how could it be inappropriate if Kim had also had a relationship with Mel?’ the source told the Sunday Telegraph.

A former trustee of the charity added that the sacking of Mr Crossley was ‘hush-hush’, with the circumstances of his departure never being revealed.

The charity’s most recent annual report notes: ‘One employee who is no longer employed by Blue Cross received £174,233 during the course of the year.’

It is believed that Mr Crossley was given a year’s salary, a £60,000 payoff and other benefits that had been accrued.

Miss Brown, whose relationship with Mr Crossley ended when he left the charity, told friends she had been upset by her treatment by Miss Hamilton.

After their relationship ended, Miss Hamilton began seeing one of Miss Brown’s close friends who also worked at the charity.

She is said to have sent Miss Brown a Valentine card last February after the relationship had ended, which left her confused.

Last August, Miss Brown was found hanged at her flat in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. An inquest will be held later this year.

There is no suggestion that her relationship with Miss Hamilton was in any way linked to her suicide.

However, police investigating the death are understood to want to look at a laptop on which Miss Brown is said to have kept a personal journal, which included her thoughts on her relationship with Miss Hamilton.

It has been claimed that after the laptop was returned to Blue Cross following her death the journal was deleted, but parts of it have now been recovered.

Blue Cross is a charity that provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership

The charity’s website states that Miss Hamilton lives in a ‘sleepy village with her partner Maria and their beloved dogs’.

Miss Hamilton split from private investigator Maria Cooper two years ago. She now lives in London with her new girlfriend, who no longer works for Blue Cross.

The charity was founded in 1897 and has four animal hospitals, 12 rehoming centres and an income of £31million.

Chairman Zair Berry said last night that no comment could be made until after Miss Brown’s inquest, and that Mr Crossley left in 2012 ‘for purely performance-related reasons’.

Mr Crossley, who now works for the Marine Conservation Society, declined to comment at his home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
