Over the past year, a dizzying array of BB (Blemish or Beauty Balm) and CC (Color Correcting) creams have stormed beauty shelves across the country.

Just when we thought we had finally figured out the alphabet formulas, Juice Generation has launched a 'DD', or 'Dynamic Do-All', skin shot that claims to work from the inside out.

We road tested the new shot, which was created with celebrity dermatologist Dr David Colbert and contains green tea and guarana. 

Taking a shot: The DD mini-drinks by Juice Generation like Aloe Vera, E3 Live and Bee Pollen + Maca all contain ingredients that are meant to give a big nutritional boost in a single sip

In
 portion size and possible health benefits, Juice Generation founder 
Eric Helms claims that the shots are like 'next generation wheatgrass' - but without the distinctive taste.

Priced at $3.95 each, the mini-drinks are becoming a growing trend 
among Type A New Yorkers who want a boost before a post-work gym session
 or afternoon meeting.

The ingredients in the latest DD shot claim to have benefits ranging from easing eczema symptoms to aiding weight loss.

When downed the ice-cold mini-drink (it's meant to be kept refrigerated) in one gulp, my first impression was that it tasted a lot like flavored iced tea - perfect for a summer day pick-me-up. 

It was refreshing and much lighter than the plant-based fresh booster shots I buy at the juice bar.

Glowing skin: Miranda Kerr credits her organic diet with helping her achieve an amazing complexion

And while my complexion did not immediately glow like Miranda Kerr's, I did notice that I powered straight through the afternoon without experiencing my usual 4 pm slump. 

This made sense once I did a quick search of the ingredients, and discovered that guarana is also a stimulant whose seeds contain around twice as much caffeine as coffee plants.

Juice Generation has launched six shots previously, all with different ingredients.

Among them are Sea Buckthorn, made from a hand-harvested Himalayan berry thought to have beauty-boosting properties, E3 Live, and Bee Pollen + Maca, which Juice Generation calls 'nature's multivitamin.'

A spokesperson for the New York Dermatology Group, where Dr. Colbert is based, explained that the nutritional supplements aren't meant to have an immediate effect, but to be used as part of a healthy diet.

In addition to his more aggressive beauty treatments like lasers and Botox, Dr. Colbert advises his patients to drink a cup of green tea and take a fish oil capsule every day.

The idea is that over time - unlike a tequila shot - DDs can help improve the appearance of skin.
