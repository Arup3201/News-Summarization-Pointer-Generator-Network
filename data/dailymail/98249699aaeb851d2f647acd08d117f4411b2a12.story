The parents of a six-year-old girl waited almost 24-hours to raise the alarm after their daughter went missing.

Washington state sheriff's deputies are now frantically attempting to make up for precious lost time as they search for the first-grader.

Janice Paulette Wright was last seen Saturday night when she went to bed at the family home in east Bremerton.

However, even on Sunday morning when young Janice was nowhere to be found, did the family become worried.

The little girl had apparently left home on previous occasions and wandered around the neighborhood.

The parents did not end up calling the police until they became desperate at around 9p.m. on Sunday, 
the sheriff's office said.

The family felt it was relatively safe because it's a fenced property, said Deputy Scot Wilson.

Police said the family became 
concerned when they hadn’t heard from Janice by 8:30 p.m. and started 
going door to door in the mobile home park.

On the hunt: Kitsap County deputies at the mobile home park in Bremerton

When they couldn’t find her, they called 911 at 9:55 p.m. on Sunday.

Kitsap
 County Sheriff’s deputies arrived at the mobile home park at 10:34 p.m.
 and requested help from the sheriff’s search and rescue unit.  Central 
Kitsap Fire and Rescue responded with a thermal imaging device to help 
find the missing girl.

A ground search with search and rescue volunteers and K-9 teams began about 1:30 a.m.

'Yes. It is strange. At this point we don't suspect an abduction from the house,' Wilson said. 'Right now the focus is on (search and rescue).'

Detectives have started an 
investigation.  Investigators said there may have been sightings of 
Janice in the mobile home park between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.

Janice has been entered into the FBI National Crime Information Center as a missing child

The search began about 1:30 a.m. Monday with deputies and volunteers in and around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park, where the girl lives with her parents and six siblings.

Searchers have used dogs and heat-sensing equipment.

Janice is 3 feet tall, weighs 45 pounds and has black hair. She'll be a first-grader this coming school year.

Two other children in the home, an 8-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, were removed from the home by Child Protective Services, Kitsap County deputies said, as they felt conditions in the home jeopardized the safety of the children.

The parents have been cooperative, and are not in police custody.

It was not unusual for her to disappear during the day so the family did not call for help until Sunday evening
