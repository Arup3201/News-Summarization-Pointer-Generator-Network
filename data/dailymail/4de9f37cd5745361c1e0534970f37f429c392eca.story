The plane waiting to take off was filled with passengers and had £32million worth of diamonds in the hold.

Three minutes later the gems were gone – all the time it needed for a gang of robbers armed with machine guns to force their way in, seize them and escape.

Not a shot was fired and the passengers were apparently unaware of the drama until their flight was cancelled minutes later.

Smash and grab: Armed robbers have stolen diamonds worth more than £32million as they were being loaded on to this plane at Brussels airport

Investigations: Police officers pictured at the scene of the heist last night

Late arrival: Security staff place barriers along the safety fence, where the armed robbers are believed to have burst through before making a beeline for the diamonds as they were being loaded onto the plane

The daring heist was carried out at Brussels airport when eight masked robbers wearing police uniforms broke through a security fence and drove on to the tarmac unchallenged in two cars with blue flashing lights.

Once inside the hold they quickly located the 120 parcels of diamonds kept in a sealed container no bigger than a shoebox.

It is understood that the gems had just been put on board.

They had been brought to the airport in an armoured van which was still beside the Swiss plane during the robbery.

Last night investigators had found the charred remains of the van most likely used in the heist but little else.

Brazen: An airport spokesman said the robbers made a hole in the perimeter fence and drove up to the Swiss passenger plane, which was ready to leave, while wearing outfits that resembled police uniforms

Brazen: The gang threatened staff and seized two locked metal trunks containing the valuables as they were being loaded onto a Helvetic Airlines flight to Zurich at around 8pm on Monday night

The gang’s remarkable efficiency led to speculation last night that it could have been an inside job.

They broke through the airport’s perimeter fence using a Mercedes and an Audi around 20 minutes before the Helvetic Airways plane bound for Zurich was due to take off at 8pm on Monday.

They made a high-speed exit through the same hole in the fence.

Because many of the diamonds were uncut, the chances of recovering them are said to be very low.

They had been transported from Antwerp where eight in ten of the world’s rough diamonds are processed.

Great escape: The gang used two black cars in their raid, grabbed the cache of stones and sped off into the darkness, said Anja Bijnens, spokeswoman for the Brussels prosecutor's office

A decade ago, the Belgian city of Antwerp, the world capital of diamond-cutting, was the scene of what was probably one of the biggest diamond heists in history.

Robbers took precious stones, jewels, gold and securities from the high-security vaults at Antwerp's Diamond Center, yielding loot that police in 2003 estimated to be worth about $100 million. 

Antwerp's Diamond Center stands in the heart of the high-surveillance diamond district where police and dozens of cameras work around the clock.

Security has been beefed up further since the spectacular 2003 robbery.

But it is thought the goods stolen in Monday's raid, 30 miles away in Brussels, may have belonged to those very traders who that security is trying to protect.

Prosecutors would not say who owned the diamonds or what they were worth.

Belgian state broadcaster VRT initially reported that the value was €350million (£300million).

A spokesman for the Antwerp Diamond Centre later said the value may be closer to £32million.

‘In any case it’s one of the biggest robberies we’ve seen,’ he added.

Brussels airport spokesman Jan Van Der Cruijsse could not explain how the area could be so vulnerable to theft.

He said: ‘We abide by the most stringent rules.’

Philip Baum, a British aviation security consultant, said the lack of an immediate response to the security breach was concerning.

He said: ‘It does seem very worrying that someone can actually have the time to drive two vehicles on to the airport, effect the robbery, and drive out without being intercepted.’

A decade ago, robbers made off with valuables estimated to be worth £50million at the time from the vaults at Antwerp Diamond Centre.

In 1983, six robbers broke into the Brink’s-MAT warehouse at Heathrow and made off with gold, diamonds and cash worth £26million.

Only two of the robbers were convicted and most of the gold was never recovered.

Precious: The robbers made off with a cluster of diamonds like this worth an estimated £32.3million ($50m)
