DNA samples from thousands of foreign criminals have been deleted from British databases due to a legal loophole.

Police are not allowed to store swabs or fingerprints from offenders who were convicted abroad, it emerged yesterday.

The scandal was revealed in the annual report from Britain’s independent biometrics watchdog. In one case, police had to delete samples from a burglary suspect after he was arrested in the UK, even though he had served 13 years for similar offences elsewhere in Europe.

Police are only allowed to store biometric data when an offender has been convicted in Britain. If they are merely arrested, the data must be destroyed.

The Biometrics Commissioner, Alastair MacGregor, said: ‘This seemed to me to be an obviously unsatisfactory state of affairs which might well be putting the UK public at unnecessary risk.’

He continued: ‘The effect of those legislative arrangements has been that the DNA profiles and fingerprints of some thousands of individuals who have been convicted of such offences outside England and Wales have had to be deleted from the UK national databases.’

Until 2008, officers were allowed to keep profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The details of about 4.5million people are held on the British database even though one in five – including 40,000 children – have never been charged.

However, a landmark ruling from European judges has meant that it is now unlawful for police to store swabs and fingerprints from suspects later cleared of wrongdoing.

The current rules mean a foreign suspect could be arrested in Britain but, after being released, their DNA would still be deleted from British databases even though police know they have been convicted of a crime elsewhere.

They could then commit an offence in Britain and get away with it, because officers would not be able to use their DNA samples to secure a conviction.

The Home Office said that for the most serious criminals – such as rapists, murders and terrorists – exceptions could be made. However, in order to retain DNA from the majority of overseas offenders, police must repeatedly visit them to take further samples and fingerprints under different sections of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

Mr MacGregor said this would place huge workloads on forces. In addition, he warned that re-arresting suspects and forcing them to provide new DNA samples could ‘constitute greater interference with their privacy’ than holding on to samples that have already been taken.

The watchdog said the legislation also meant ‘difficulties have arisen’ with retaining biometric data from criminals who have been convicted in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which are different police jurisdictions.

If a foreign criminal is arrested on suspicion of a crime in the UK, details of previous offences can be secured from police forces elsewhere in Europe.

But Mr MacGregor also warned that these cannot be placed on the police’s national computer database unless the suspect is convicted here.

The news comes after the Association of Chief Police Officers revealed that foreigners accounted for one in seven crime suspects apprehended last year.

It is thanks to European judges who ruled keeping details were unlawful
