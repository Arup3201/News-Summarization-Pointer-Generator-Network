It is an embarrassing moment for any diner - going to pay and having your credit card declined.

But this is the fate that met President Barack Obama during a recent meal at a New York restaurant.

Speaking at a finance meeting today, the politician revealed his card was rejected when he went out for dinner with his wife, Michelle, during the U.N. General Assembly last month.

Instead, Mrs Obama had to pay.

President Barack Obama (pictured speaking at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington today) revealed his credit card was rejected during a recent meal with his wife, Michelle, in New York

'I went to a restaurant in New York when I was there during the General Assembly, and my credit card was rejected,' Obama told employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington.

'I guess I don't use it enough, so they thought there was some fraud going on. Fortunately, Michelle had hers. I was trying to explain to the waitress, you know, I really think I've been paying my bills.'

Speaking amid cries of laughter, he added: 'Even I'm affected by this!',' CNN reported.

Although Obama did not reveal at which restaurant his plastic problems occurred, he was spotted having a romantic date night with his wife of 22 years at Estela in downtown Manhattan  last month.

Order: Following the meal, the small tapas-style restaurant posted an Instagram shot of the Obamas' order (above) It included burrata with salsa verde and bread, two endive salads, and tomatoes and croquettes

During their time at the small tapas-style restaurant on East Houston Street, he and Michelle ate burrata with salsa verde and bread, two endive salads, and tomatoes and croquettes.

Police cars were spotted stationed outside the venue, while locals saw Obama's presidential motorcade speeding through the Nolita neighborhood later  that night.

Following the meal, Estela said it was ‘humbled’ by the presidential visit and posted an Instagram shot of the Obamas' order.

Obama, who reportedly owns a JPMorgan credit card, spoke of his card decline while signing an executive order that aims to make the federal payments system safer for millions of Americans.

Cards issued by the federal government will now have an internal chip replacing magnetic strips to reduce the potential for fraud, Obama said.

It comes amid growing concern over the security of Americans' financial data, with an estimated 100 million people having been affected by breaches in the past year.

In addition, the government will apply the security chips and personal identification numbers (PINs) that replace signatures to all existing and newly issued government credit cards, Obama said.

Meanwhile, payment terminals at federal government facilities will be equipped to handle cards with the new technology.

Obama said that for victims of fraud and identity crimes, the experience is infuriating and heartbreaking. He said the problem requires a hands-on approach across the government.

The White House says the idea of the government program is to lead by example, to nudge the broader financial industry and retailers toward more secure standards.

Obama noted that Home Depot Inc., Target Corp., Walgreen Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plan to install payment terminals  equipped to handle cards with digital security chips and PINs.

He also cited a plan by American Express Co. to support small businesses that upgrade their payment terminals with more secure standards.

And he referred to a program by payments processor Visa Inc. to inform consumers and merchants about the new technologies.

'There is a need to act, and to move our economy toward stronger, more secure technologies that better secure transactions and safeguard sensitive data,' the White House said in a statement.

Obama's executive order also calls for the government to take new measures to help victims of identity theft. The Federal Trade Commission will develop a new website for consumers to report identity theft and remedy errors with credit reporting.

And Obama called on Congress to enact a single national standard for retailers to notify consumers of data breaches, to replace a patchwork of state laws.
