A British woman charged with stalking and shaking down New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has said he got her phony identification to use in getting an abortion after she became pregnant with his child.

Mr Cashman's spokesman Chris Giglio said on Wednesday that the allegations amount to 'more fiction' from a woman already facing stalking, perjury and other charges.

'When I informed Mr. Cashman that I decided to terminate the pregnancy he demanded that I provide him with two passport size photographs so he could obtain a fake ID,' Louise Neathway, who also goes by Meanwell, claimed in papers filed Monday in a Manhattan civil court according to the New York Post.

Mr Cashman returned to her, she claims, with an ID that showed her with the name 'Rosalita Gonzalez.'

The accusations made without an attorney come as a prelude to a possible lawsuit, although it's yet not clear whom she might sue.

She is currently facing criminal charges of stalking Mr Cashman and extorting thousands of dollars from him, harassing her ex-husband and another man and lying to a grand jury.

She has pleaded not guilty and is jailed on Rikers Island on a $300,000 bond.

Accusations: Prosecutors say Neathway stalked Cashman and got him to pay her $6,000 by threatening to damage his reputation

The Manhattan district attorney's office says Ms Neathway deluged Mr Cashman with calls and text messages, demanded money for a medical procedure and threatened to harm his reputation if he didn't pay.

In response, he paid her $6,000, according to a court complaint. She was arrested in February.

'[Mr Cashman] provided emotional support and was quite decent to me in the days after the procedure,' she wrote adding that he 'seemed to struggle with his religious convictions in opposing abortion yet being party to a pregnancy that was terminated.'

Ms Neathway, a 36-year-old medical sales worker originally from Britain, said in the sworn statement she filed Monday that she and the then-married Mr Cashman were friends for about six years before they began a nine-month affair in April 2011.

When told she was pregnant with his baby in June 2011, Cashman said he wouldn't participate in raising the child, she said in the document.

She said she decided on an abortion, and he then insisted on providing her a fake ID.

'He also took care in finding a clinic to provide the abortion service and car service for me on the day of the procedure,' she said in the papers, which she filed without a lawyer. She's been in the process of changing lawyers in her criminal case.

While prosecutors accuse her of barraging him with phone calls, Ms Neathway said her phone records show she got more than 100 calls from him between mid-December and the end of January.

Mr Cashman's wife of 16 years filed for divorce in February.

The couple with two children had been separated for a year, according to a person familiar with the family, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the matter.

In March Neathway was also indicted on a second count by the Manhattan court for harassing an ex-boyfriend, Wall Street banker Thomas Walsh.

Promises: On a drunken night together at the Louise Neathway's apartment, Cashman allegedly bragged to her that he could use his power as Yankee's manager to help her in her custody battle

Mr Walsh had a protection order against Neathway after she bombarded him with text messages in the wake of their split, according to the New York Post.

The case took another twist in March when photos emerged that allegedly show Mr Cashman drinking at a bar with the woman he claimed is his stalker - before sneaking out of her apartment the following morning.

Surveillance photos obtained by the Daily News appeared to show the Yankees general manager leaving Ms Neathway’s New York building at 5.41am after the couple spent a night together.

Ms Neathway claimed the pictures of the pair enjoying a meal together at a Manhattan restaurant were captured on January 19 – just twelve days before she was charged with harassing and stalking the Yankees manager.

The New York Yankees team has vowed to stand by Mr Cashman as the embarrassing 
stalking case continues to make headlines.

The trove of emails sent to Mr Cashman 
and his lawyer by Ms Neathway, who claims she had an affair with the 
father-of-two and allegedly blackmailed him for $6,000, were obtained by
 the New York Daily News.

Neathway allegedly bombarded Mr Cashman 
with emails and even attached an ultrasound scan of their alleged unborn
 to one of the messages.

'What Brian Cashman has done to me is 
both incomprehensible and unforgivable,' Ms Neathway reportedly wrote in an email 
sent with the scan on January 29.

'I am going to the press and 
informaing [sic] them of the preganacy [sic] and the abortion. And 
everything else,' she writes in the typo-littered message, reported the Daily 
News.

'So you can have a 
little gloat at my agony here is my ultra sound picture. . . I guess its
 ok for me to just push this aside right? Men!!!'

Prior accusations: Cashman is not the first man to accuse her of stalking and making threats

Second sting: Cashman's wife has since filed for divorce requesting joint custody of their two children and share in their $3.7 million Darien mansion with this latest sting being his second affair during their marriage

Ms Neathway,
 in a separate email sent a day later, threatened to make Mr Cashman’s life
 hell unless he paid for her 'abortion'.

Prosecutors said Ms Neathway harassed Mr Cashman with hundreds of 
text messages, and demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for an 
unspecified medical procedure.

She
 allegedly threatened to contact the press and his family with claims 
that would hurt his personal relationships and professional standing, 
according to a court complaint.

Mr Cashman made two payments, one for 
$4,000 and another for $2,000. Mr Cashman moved out of the family mansion 
after Ms Neathway was charged with stalking and harassing him.

Mr Cashman is the latest in a line of men 
who claim she has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking 
and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former 
friends claim, according to the Post.
