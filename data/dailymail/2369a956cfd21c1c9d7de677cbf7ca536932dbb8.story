A school district has been ordered to pay a special needs boy $15,000 after a bus driver duct taped his mouth to keep him quiet on the way to school.

Nick Tirado, now 13, claimed the 
unidentified driver picked him up from his Deer Park, New York, home in
 October 2012 and grew frustrated with his loud voice. 

The student, who has ADHD, said the driver covered his mouth with red duct tape in front of his laughing classmates, papers filed in Long Island federal court state.

Nick's school counselor reported the incident to authorities when he showed up on campus with his mouth tape shut.

'My son, he already struggles with 
social and emotional disabilities,' Nick's mother, Melissa Tirado, told The New York Post.

'We 
work with the school, and it was something we discussed with them. That 
day it was just 'how do we shut Nicholas up?''

It is not known which school Nick attended.

Ms Tirado, a New York police officer, said she was devastated that her son was publicly humiliated, particularly as his ADHD makes him extremely talkative.

'As much as you like to think it’s a joke, you’ve got to realize it’s degrading, it’s embarrassing,' Ms Tirado told The Post.

Nick's parents filed the federal suit against Deer Park school district last year, claiming the boy suffered extreme emotional distress.

The district has paid the family $15,000 in compensation and apologized.

The district has not commented publicly on the case.
