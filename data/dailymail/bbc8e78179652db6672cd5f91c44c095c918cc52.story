Its catchprase is ‘more reasons to shop at Morrisons’.

But animal lovers have fewer reasons to shop there following the supermarket’s festive advert featuring a child feeding Christmas Pudding to the family dog.

Vets warned that dried fruit in the cake could cause acute renal failure and death in dogs if left untreated and branded the supermarket ‘irresponsible’ for showing the advert.

Campaigners have now set up a Facebook page and have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the advert, saying it encourages people to feed Christmas pudding to dogs.

'Not everyone loves traditional Christmas pud': A child in the Morrisons advert looks suspiciously at some Christmas pudding placed on his plate

Sneaky: When no one is looking, the child lifts up the Christmas pudding and starts to lower it beneath the table

The 20-second clip shows a young boy being handed a plate with a slice of the pudding that he then passes to his little brother who then passes it to the family dog under the table.

The advert, which showcases Morrisons’ alternative Christmas desserts, features the voiceover saying: ‘Not everyone loves traditional Christmas pud’.

Although the dog deposits the Christmas pudding in the plant pot, the advert suggests that dogs can eat the dessert, despite the dangers which are well-known to dog-lovers, according to campaigners.

Paula Boyden, veterinary director of the Dogs Trust, said any advert that suggested feeding Christmas pudding to dogs was ‘irresponsible’.

She said: ‘We don’t know exactly why it is toxic, but if dogs eat dried fruit they will suffer vomiting, diarrhoea, weakness and lethargy and eventually acute renal failure if it isn’t treated.

‘There’s always a risk around Christmas time with Christmas puddings, Christmas cake and chocolate. Christmas is a bit of a minefield for dogs.

‘If you do think your dog has consumed dried fruit, you need to seek immediate veterinary attention. The vet may then induce vomiting in the dog to get rid of the food before they absorb it.

Going, going, gone: The child successfully manages to hide the pudding underneath the table

Warning: Vets and animal charities are unhappy that the advert shows the boy handing the pudding to a dog as dried fruit is toxic to animals

‘The bottom line is that dried fruits are very, very toxic and they could end up costing you your dog’s life.’

She warned owners not to feed their pets raisins, sultanas, currants, dates, grapes, mince pies, Christmas pudding, alcohol, onion, raw green potato, turkey (or any other) bones and chocolate.

Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today Magazine (ALL CORR), said her readers had been outraged the moment they saw the advert and demanded Morrisons stop showing the advert and apologise.

She said: ‘We received a number of complaints about the advert the minute it aired.

‘Everyone knows about the danger of giving dogs chocolate but I’m not sure that people know the dangers of the dried fruit in Christmas pudding.

‘All you need is a child to watch it, to give the pudding to a less fussy dog than the one in the advert and the animal could suffer renal failure and die.

‘It would have been nice if they had consulted a vet or a welfare group before filming this advert, or even a dog owner as most of them are well aware of the problems with dried fruit.’

She said the advert showed a little boy ‘poisoning’ his pet dog, adding: ‘It’s like giving a dog Warfarin. It really is that bad.’ 

'Misleading': The dog then deposits the Christmas pudding in a plant pot but campaigners argue the advert makes it seem the dessert is not dangerous to dogs

Minimal risk: A Morrisons spokesman said that vets advised the supermarket there would be minimal, if any, risks to a dog from eating a small amount of Christmas pudding

Critics have now set up a Facebook page where people can give their opinions on the advert: https://www.facebook.com/MorrisonsChristmasPuddingTvAdCouldKill

Two years ago, John Lewis caused controversy when their Christmas advert featured a shot of the family dog out in the howling wind and snow in a kennel that was too small for it.

Outraged campaigners said the shots of the wolfhound sitting in the kennel set a bad example to other owners and encouraged animal cruelty.

The company apologised and cut the clip from some of their adverts. Morrisons are continuing to show the advert.

Ms Cuddy added: ‘John Lewis got it in the neck for what their Christmas advert about the dog. It set animal welfare back about 50 years because everyone thought that if it’s ok for John Lewis, it’s ok for everyone.

‘By the same logic, Morrison are telling us that children who don’t like Christmas pudding should give it to the dog. It’s very irresponsible.’

Peter Jones, President of the British Veterinary Association, said: ‘It is vital that advertisers use animals responsibly and we are disappointed to see the Morrisons Christmas desserts TV commercial depicting a small boy feeding Christmas pudding to his dog.

‘Christmas pudding, Christmas cake and mince pies - because they contain raisins or sultanas - are potentially harmful to pets and in some cases can lead to kidney failure.

‘While we accept that many pet owners understand what is and what is not appropriate to feed their pets, children watch adverts and can be easily influenced by what they see.

‘Veterinary organisations and animal welfare charities work really hard to promote messages about responsible pet ownership and TV adverts such as this one, with huge audiences, can undermine this work.’

So far, 40 people have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the clip.Dog-lover Jan Yates posted a comment on the Facebook page saying: ‘My grandchildren (3, 3 and 6) constantly copy things they see on the TV, particularly the little ones.

‘As we can’t watch them 24/7 I feel this is incredibly irresponsible of Morrisons.

‘Had they put their hands up to it straight away I would forgive sloppy research, but to continue with the ad is arrogance personified.’

Emma Judson said: ‘Imagine the advert said some people don’t like Advocaat and showed Grandma handing a glass of the horrible stuff to the toddler who then pours it into a plant pot...’

A Morrisons spokesman said: ‘We know that many of our customers are dog lovers and we would never run any advert that encouraged poor pet care.

‘We were therefore careful to seek veterinary advice prior to filming the advert and ensured we had a vet present during filming.

‘The veterinary advice we received concluded that there would be minimal, if any, risk to a dog of serious toxic reaction should a small amount, in relation to its body weight, of Christmas cake or pudding be consumed on a one-off basis.’

The spokesman added that the advice was that there would only be a risk of toxicity if a dog ate raw fruits weighing 1 - 2.5lbs - a figure that vets said was inaccurate.
