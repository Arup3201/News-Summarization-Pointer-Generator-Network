A British ballet dancer who performed in neutral Spain during World War One was a spy feeding classified information to the Germans, a new book has revealed.

Elizabeth Bedlington is said to have delivered secret documents to German forces as she travelled across Spain performing under the name La Titanesca.

In his new book, Spanish historian Fernando García Sanz tells how Bedlington turned traitor after being recruited by her Austro-Hungarian husband Gunter Hopf.

Traitor: British ballerina Elizabeth Bedlington, who performed in Spain under the name La Titanesca during World War One, was a spy working for the Germans, according to a new book

Bedlington was later identified as a 'mule' by allied forces, but managed to escape arrest, and remained in Spain until her death, according to a report in the Times newspaper. 

According to the book, the Italian secret service identified her as a 'mule', and she was barred from travelling to the country.

Originally from London, Bedlington is described as a Mata Hari-type figure, referring to the Dutch courtesan who was executed by French troops for feeding information to the Germans.

García Sanz's 426-page book, entitled 
España en la Gran Guerra (Spain in the Great War), is due out next week and tells of numerous female spies working for the Germans.

They
 include Pilar Millán Astray, the sister of the founder of Spain's 
military Legion, who went on to become a famous Spanish novelist.

She reportedly stole documents from the UK Ambassador to Spain before handing them over to the Germans in 1917.

Referring to Spain's role in the war, García Sanz, described the country as a spying ground for both sides.

He told Spanish daily El País: 'Mata Hari was no-one compared to other female spies who were so good that even to this day they haven't been identified'.
