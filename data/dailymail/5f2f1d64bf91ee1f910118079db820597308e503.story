A Virgin America flight was forced to divert after a passenger started pleasuring himself mid-flight before trying to open an exit door.

The LAX bound plane was forced to make an unscheduled landing Monday morning at Omaha's Eppley Airfield in Nebraska. 

Doug Adams, of Woodside, was 'masturbating in flight and later tried to open an exit door,' according to the Omaha Police Department report.

Omaha police say Adams was on drugs and experiencing a psychotic episode when he got up from his seat and tried to open an exit door, according to a report obtained by NBC Bay Area.

Sam Slater, an LA film producer, videotaped police officers boarding the plane in Omaha and taking a man away in handcuffs.

He told CBSLA.com the 26-year-old was wearing a hospital bracelet and sat behind him on the plane.

'He asked if he could use the restroom, he had been mumbling about not trying to be violent, and how I don't want to be a violent person,' he said.  

Slater's business partner, Paul Bernon said: 'When he came out of the bathroom, he sat back down, he was arguing with the woman next to him, said he didn't want to sit next to her.' 

'He got back up, told the attendant he wanted her to move, and at that point they paged to see if there was a doctor on board.'

A doctor examined the passenger, who was taken to a back row of seats that had been cleared for him. 

'He at that point was fidgeting and began to remove the plastic covering from the emergency exit door, and tried to pull to open the door,' Slater said.

The plane was headed from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles when it made the stop in Omaha

He said that there were two Boston police officers on the flight who restrained him until the plane landed.

Passengers who disrupt a flight can face federal charges, especially if they interfere with aircraft crew members.  

The U.S. Attorney's Office said that Adams was taken to the hospital for observation.

A total of 108 passengers and crew members were onboard the flight out of Boston when it was diverted to Omaha, Nebraska Monday morning, Virgin America spokeswoman Christie O'Toole said in a statement told ABC News.

O'Toole said the flight was diverted 'due to a medical incident involving a guest on board.'
