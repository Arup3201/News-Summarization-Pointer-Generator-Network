David de Gea produced save after save in another match-winning performance for Manchester United on Sunday as their old rivals Liverpool were swept aside 3-0.

The Spanish keeper's prowess in one-on-one situations and also his outstanding reactions and shot-stopping left Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli infuriated at Old Trafford.

De Gea's class isn't in doubt, but where does he rank among the world's best right now? We count down our top 10. Feel free to add your list in the comments section below.

10. Keylor Navas (Real Madrid and Costa Rica)

His excellent performances for surprise package Costa Rica at the World Cup earned Navas a move from Levante, where he had also impressed, to Real Madrid. Though he is playing second fiddle to Iker Casillas for now, Navas is clearly a capable stand-in and one for the long-term.

9. Samir Handanovic (Inter Milan and Slovenia)

These may be far from vintage times for Inter Milan but in Slovenian stopper Handanovic they have a well-regarded and consistent performer. Penalty saves are a speciality, with five in Serie A and one in the UEFA Europa League this season.

8. Salvatore Sirigu (Paris Saint-Germain and Italy)

Long considered the heir-apparent to Gianluigi Buffon, Sirigu continued to wait his turn on the international stage while excelling for his club, Paris Saint-Germain, who dominated the French league last season and are looking for an extended run in the Champions League this time round.

7. Iker Casillas (Real Madrid and Spain)

It looked for a while as though it might all be over for the legendary Spain keeper when he lost his place in Real's team for league matches two seasons ago. But he responded by helping them to a 10th Champions League crown. and, hey presto, he's back to being No 1 for this campaign.

Casillas is approaching 700 career appearances for his one club and also has 160 caps for Spain - and he's still top class.

6. Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur and France)

While Tottenham's season may not be going entirely to plan, Lloris has preserved his reputation as one of the world's best keepers.

Maybe it's a sign of their vulnerable defence that Lloris has had to make more saves this season than many of the others in this list but he's made them nonetheless and won many points as a result.

5. Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus and Italy)

It is 13 years since Buffon's big money move to Juventus and yet the 36-year-old retains his class and influence for both club and country.

Just look at the stats: Buffon has kept 10 clean sheets in 14 league matches for Juventus this season, the second highest in Europe's top leagues, and he has conceded just five goals in those games. 

He's been performing to the highest standards throughout the 727 club matches and 146 appearances for Italy and long may it continue.

4. Joe Hart (Manchester City and England)

His abilities were called into question last season as a couple of high-profile mistakes saw him replaced by Costel Pantilimon in Manchester City's line-up. 

But Hart wasn't deterred and has roared back to form, making crucial, match-defining saves to keep his team in contention in both the Premier League and the Champions League. 

He also remains indisputably No 1 for England and this return to his best will be rewarded with a new long-term contract.

3. Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea and Belgium)

It seemed like Courtois was waiting for ages for his chance at Chelsea, impressing consistently on loan for Atletico Madrid and for his country Belgium, but he's seized it with both hands. 

With his maturity and well-honed shot-stopping skills, it's often hard to forget that Courtois is still only 22.

As expected, he has replaced Petr Cech as Chelsea's No 1 straight away and hasn't put a foot wrong as Chelsea have set the pace in the Premier League.

2. David de Gea (Manchester United and Spain)

The Spanish keeper looked initially uncomfortable with the physicality of the Premier League but has grown in stature, seeming to improve with every match. 

He has been absolutely indispensable to Manchester United this season and it's no exaggeration to suggest they might be in the bottom half without him. 

De Gea is excellent in one-on-one situations, as he proved against Sterling on Sunday, and has incredible reflexes to keep out shots, even at close quarters. Will undoubtedly establish himself as Spain's No 1 in the future.

1. Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich and Germany)

With his World Cup winners' medal and Ballon d'Or nomination, few would argue that Neuer is the world's best stopper at the moment.

He was a rock-solid presence for Germany, keeping four clean sheets and winning the Golden Glove accolade for the tournament's best keeper. 

That came off the back of another dominant season with Bayern, who won a Bundesliga and German Cup double, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. 

Most impressive about Neuer is that he has reinvented a role on the pitch, with his 'sweeper keeper' approach that often sees him charge 30 or 40 yards from his line to mug opposing strikers of the ball.
