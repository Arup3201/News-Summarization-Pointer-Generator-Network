Under pressure: NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, pictured, warned this week that the health service needs another £8 billion a year by 2020 to keep afloat

The cash-strapped NHS is paying GPs £100,000 a year for working only weekends, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Doctors are earning ‘jaw-dropping’ pay packets for shifts that can involve simply answering the phone at the NHS’s non-emergency 111 helpline for a couple of days a week.

Recruitment agencies are offering the cushy jobs to doctors to work in some of the most attractive parts of Britain, including Cornwall, Herefordshire and rural Kent.

Our revelations come days after new NHS chief executive Simon Stevens warned the health service needs another £8 billion a year by 2020 to keep afloat – even if it does everything possible to cut its costs.

But we have discovered the sums paid to GP locums are, in the words of a leading MP, ‘spiralling out of control’.

Recruitment agencies say GPs can ‘pick and choose’ where and when to work. ‘Doctors aren’t shy of asking for higher rates,’ said one.

Last week, London’s CES Locums placed an advertisement in the doctors’ magazine Pulse, promising a six-figure salary for working weekends. It read: ‘Locum Opportunities – Earn from £100k pa from weekend work only and over £200k for full-time work.’

Other firms claim locum GPs can pull in £100,000 for ‘out-of-hours’ work.

To test the claim we asked a practising GP to call CES Locums. She was told: ‘You can probably add up to about £3,000 a weekend. To earn the most I would advise Cornwall, because I can give you the maximum number of hours… That’s where the money is.’

She should expect to work three or four hours on Friday evening, then all-day shifts on Saturday and Sunday, he said.

The recruitment consultant claimed the firm had ‘quite a few doctors’ working in this way. ‘I’ve a doctor who works every weekend. That’s the only job that she does. She probably clears between £7,000 and £8,000 a month.’

The Cornish weekend work was ‘more like a working holiday, especially in summer’, he said: ‘If you’ve got a family it’s quite nice, it’s quite relaxed.’

CES Locums offered the GP weekend work at similar rates in Kent and Hertfordshire.

Other firms confirmed it was possible for locums to earn £100,000 for weekend work. Gareth Filkins, of RMR Recruitment, said the market was ‘frankly crazy at the moment. There’s no lack of work; there’s just a lack of GPs,’ he said.

What had been a ‘niche’ business had ‘grown phenomenally’ since 2004, he said. Then, Labour let GPs dump personal responsibility for out-of-hours care in return for a six per cent pay cut. Firms like Serco, Care UK and IC24 filled the gap. Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘It puts them in the pop star category.’

He blamed the Labour government, saying, ‘They allowed doctors to outsource, but they never thought about how much it would cost.’

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘There must be immense scope to plan better, and cut costs.’

Dia Chakravarty, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be astonished at the jaw-dropping salaries.’

The lucrative fees a GP can earn as a stand-in mean that many clinics struggle to fill permanent positions.

One in four practices has a vacancy for a GP and many patients wait weeks to see their regular doctor.

David Cameron has promised to make it easier to see GPs. Some are paid £100 an hour for evening and weekend work under the Prime Minister’s ‘Challenge Fund’, a £50 million pot to improve seven-day access. The move – designed to relieve busy A&Es – could win votes, but will stretch demand further.

GPs are keen to stress they pay insurance of £10,000 a year out of their earnings. And Dr Peter Swinyard, a Wiltshire GP and chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said: ‘I can’t imagine any solicitor would work for £80 an hour on a Saturday or Sunday.’

But he said locum fees were crippling surgeries – and making it harder to convince younger GPs to work for a practice full-time. Dr Swinyard, who earns £80,000 before tax, said GP partners like him were paid less than many locums, despite having to deal with NHS paperwork and carry the financial risk of running a surgery.

‘We’ve a system where there’s little incentive to work as a GP partner, and more incentive to work all around the place,’ he said. ‘But if someone’s got a serious illness, they need to see the same doctor each time.’

Dr Sarah Wollaston, a GP and Conservative chair of the Health Select Committee, said: ‘The underlying problem here is the workforce shortfall in general practice, so it’s possible for people to work for agencies for these kind of rates.’

Fellow select committee member Valerie Vaz, Labour MP for Walsall South, said: ‘I’m astounded at these figures. There are many permanent GPs who are working for much less.’

Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Minister, said: ‘The bill for locums is spiralling out of control. Nurses and midwives, who’ve had pay frozen or cut, will find these figures galling. There are hundreds fewer family doctors: it’s no wonder people are struggling to get appointments.’

The Department of Health says the number of locums has dropped nine per cent since 2010, while there are 6,700 more doctors. A spokesman said it was up to local GPs to best arrange out-of-hours services and pointed to a £100 million scheme to pilot new ideas on extending access hours.

The average salary for a GP who is a partner in a surgery is £102,000, according to the latest official statistics. There are no figures for those working solely as locums.
