The National Security Agency has secretly broken into the Yahoo and Google data centers around the world to steal hundreds of millions of records, it was reported today.

Every day, the NSA sends millions of records from Yahoo and Google internal networks to data warehouses at the 
agency's Fort Meade, Maryland headquarters, the Washington Post reported, citing documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The documents include a
slide from an agency presentation 
entitled 'Google Cloud Exploitation', featuring a sketch showing where 
the 'Public Internet' meets the internal 'Google Cloud' of user data.

On
the sketch, a note adds that encryption is 'added and remove here!' and
the artist then jots a smiley face - in what the Post calls a 'cheeky 
celebration of victory over Google security'.

'Two engineers with close ties to Google exploded in profanity when they saw the drawing,' the Post reported.

In the 30 days after January 9, field collectors processed and sent back more than 180 million new records - ranging 
from 'metadata', which would indicate who sent or received emails and 
when, to content such as text, audio and video.

Both companies said they had not given the NSA permission to do so and where not aware of the activity.

The NSA's principal tool to exploit the data links is a project called MUSCULAR, operated jointly with the agency's British counterpart, GCHQ.

The program uses an unnamed 
telecommunications provider giving secret access to a
cable for Google and Yahoo to pass unencrypted traffic between their 
servers.

The Post said NSA and GCHQ are copying entire data flows across fiber-optic cables that carry information between the data centers of the Silicon Valley giants.

The NSA's leader, Gen. Keith Alexander said he was unaware of the report, adding that the NSA is not authorized to access data centers and must go through a court process to obtain it.

'The assertion that we collect vast quantities of U.S. personsâ€™ data from this type of collection is also not true,' a spokeswoman added, Politico reported.

The report comes despite the companies saying their servers are closely guarded and strictly audited. According to Google, buildings housing its servers are guarded around-the-clock and secured with heat-sensitive cameras and biometric verification.

In a statement to the Post, Google 
said it was 'troubled by allegations of the government intercepting 
traffic between our data centers, and we are not aware of this 
activity'.

At Yahoo a 
spokeswoman added: 'We have strict controls in place to protect the 
security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data 
centers to the NSA or to any other government agency.'

White House officials and the Office of 
the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, declined 
to comment, the Post said.

Revelations: The information was obtained by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden

The
NSA already collects data from Google, Yahoo and other technology 
companies under another program known as PRISM - details of which were 
revealed by Snowden earlier this year.

The program legally compels the companies to provide the agency with information that matches court-approved search terms.

The collection of data by MUSCULAR would be illegal in the U.S., but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA can presume anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner, the Post said.
