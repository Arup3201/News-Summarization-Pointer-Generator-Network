Ode to the poets: Presenter James May has asked the BBC to commission a programme on the poetry of First World War poets

Top Gear host James May hopes to turn his attentions from the power of cars to the power of words, with a special programme about First World War poets to mark this year's centenary.

May hopes to convince BBC bosses to commission the programme, which would include the poetry of Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and Rupert Brooke, among others.

During an interview for forces radio BFBS, which was recorded while visiting  troops at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan ahead of tonight's Top Gear, the 51-year-old presenter said: 'I've put it forward - I haven't heard from them yet, weirdly obviously this year is the centenary of the outbreak of World War One.

'But I thought for the first year we could commemorate the Christmas truce of 1914 when they all got out of the trenches and played football and swapped gifts and so on - and we could do that through the words of the war poets and the people who kept diaries and postcards and things.'

May, who first co-presented Top Gear in 1999, added: 'The words of the really big poets like Sassoon, (Edmund) Blunden and Owen have endured, while a lot of the other things about it, the understanding of it, is fading away.

'Those words may be the bit that survive the longest, and actually tell us a great deal about it in a very short space of time and very few words - which is what poetry is about, it's about imagery and stuff.'

Wilfred Owen, who was killed in action just one week before the signing of the Armistice on November 4, 1918, is best remembered for his shocking and realistic war poetry about the horrors of trench warfare.

This was in stark contrast to the usually patriotic verses penned by other war poets, such as Rupert Brooke.

Among his best known works, which were published posthumously, are Dulce et Decorum Est and Anthem for Doomed Youth.

Owen was heavily influenced by his friend and mentor Siegfried Sassoon, who survived the Great War and was awarded the Military Cross for his service.

Described as an 'accidental hero', Sassoon's initial innocence soon diminished against the harsh realities of war, as seen in such poems as the darkly-titled, Suicide in the Trenches.

Away from presenting Top Gear with Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond, May's other television credits include Toy Stories, which looked at his favourite childhood toys and a number of drink-inspired journeys with wine expert Oz Clarke.
