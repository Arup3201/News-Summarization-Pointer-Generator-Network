A familiar face from the past returned to Dens Park yesterday to catch up with old friends and to pick up a Player of the Year trophy he won back in 2001-02. But despite the 12-year absence, it was almost as if Temuri Ketsbaia had never been away.

As had been the case when he first arrived as a player at Dundee in October 2001, Ketsbaia was blown away by a welcome as warm as the unseasonably hot sun that beat down over Tayside.

While he was being shown around by Dundee director of football operations John Nelms, up popped long-serving groundsman Brian Robertson whom Kestabaia immediately greeted like an old friend, before joking that his grass was far better now than back in the day.

Ketsbaia would make it clear, though, that the way he was treated by people like Robertson made it feel like the Dark Blues’ pitch was the place where he played his best football in the UK.

That included his spells at Wolves, and, most notably, as a gifted but cantankerous midfielder at Newcastle United where he shot to fame by angrily kicking an advertising board after scoring a late winner against Bolton in 1998.

And yet, while Ketsbaia revelled in the familiarity of it all, he admitted that his return as manager of the Georgian national team for Saturday’s crucial European qualifier has made him see how Scottish football is a completely alien environment to the one he left behind all those years ago.

All it took was a glance at the Scottish Premiership league table.

The 46-year-old already knew that Rangers and Hearts were out of the top flight due to financial mismanagement while Hibs had joined them in the Championship due to rank incompetency.

But to see it there in black and white that the once-mighty Celtic, struggling so badly under Ronny Deila, were sitting in a previously unthinkable sixth-place in the table merely under-scored the old line that the past is indeed a foreign country.

In Ketsbaia’s mind, however, Scottish’s football’s well-publicised problems should be seen as an opportunity for clubs like his beloved Dundee.

He feels that, in 2014, the opportunity is there for provincial sides to win the Scottish title; an ambition which proved far beyond Dundee even in the days when he earned £10,000-per-week there and starred alongside gifted talents including Juan Sara, Fabian Caballero and his Georgian international teammate Zurab Khizanishvili.

‘Scottish football is now very different,’ nodded Ketsbaia ahead of his showdown with Gordon Strachan’s men at Ibrox on Saturday.

‘We were just talking about this earlier. The best clubs in Scotland - Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian - they are all now in the second tier.

‘And Celtic are not doing very well either. They did not qualify for the Champions League, and they are not doing very well in the league.

‘Usually by now they are already saying Celtic are the champions of Scotland. But, right now, they are six points behind the leaders (Hamilton).

‘So I think maybe it is time for the other teams in Scotland to challenge for the championship. There is not big money available in Scotland any more, even at Rangers and Celtic, so everything is possible.

‘Do I really believe another team outwith Celtic can win the title? Yes, that is what I am saying. It is possible. It is not the same Celtic as before. They have shown they are not unbeatable.’

For Ketsbaia, a swift saunter across the Dens Park turf doubled as a walk down memory lane. Albeit to a season when Dundee, for all the spending that would eventually see them end up in administration, finished an unimpressive ninth in the Scottish top flight.

‘I really enjoyed my football at Dundee,’ he smiles afterwards.

‘I played in Britain for five years, and the best I ever played was here. It was because I knew I was an important player for the club and I didn’t have the pressure of having to be the best every week to play the next game.

‘That really helped me to play my best football. I scored six goals and I really enjoyed it.

‘I was sad that I did not stay for the next year but unfortunately I got injured playing with the national team and it was difficult for me with my knee to come back and play here.

‘But it’s nice to be back and to see where I used to play. It’s nice to see them doing well, too.

‘I think, for Dundee, they need to stay in the Premiership and it won’t be a problem. After that, you build slowly. You cannot build a new team in one year – not unless you spend millions of pounds, like in the past.

‘I wish to see this club continue to grow slowly and hopefully to one day win some trophies.’

Ketsbaia is no longer in touch with his former Dundee manager, the Italian Ivano Bonetti. But he asked after old friends like Barry Smith, the club captain who now manages Championship side Alloa Athletic.

He also will never forget Steven Milne, the striker who is now manager of junior side Forfar Albion. As Ketsbaian collected a specially-made trophy from Dundee to mark his Player of the Year award 12 years ago, he recalled how Milne preventing him from winning a clean sweep in 2002.

‘We went to the different supporters’ club’s Player of the Year dinners,” he recalled.

‘I missed out on only one Player of the Year award. I got them all except one! Milne, the forward, got the other one. You see, I lost only one and even now I still remember who got it!

‘It’s good to know Milne is still in football and so, too, is Barry, our captain. That’s very good. He was a good character and also a very nice guy in the team, on the pitch, and outside the pitch. I wish him all the best.

‘It’s good that people from my old team continue to be in football. Unfortunately, there are so many people involved in football now who have no idea and it is destroying the game. It’s better to have men who have been in football and understand football running things than people who want control just because they have money.’

Next up on Ketsbaia’s nostalgic tour of Scotland will be Ibrox on Saturday as his Georgians seek to inflict some serious damage on Scotland’s bid to reach Euro 2016.

His only appearances there as a player saw Dundee lose 2-1 in February 2002 and Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta defeated 2-0 in a Champions League qualifier in 2005.

‘Ibrox is a good stadium with a nice crowd and it will be a good atmosphere to play football in,’ he said.

‘Will I be kicking any advertising boards if we win (like at Newcastle)? No, I only kicked them as a player. But if anyone thinks it’s going to be easy against us, it’s not.’

Just because Temuri Ketsbaia is an avowed fan of Scottish football won’t stop the Georgians trying to add to our woes.
