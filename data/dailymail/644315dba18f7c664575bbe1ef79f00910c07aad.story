Sam Allardyce has conceded that only a higher power can save his West Ham defenders against the mercurial talents of Sergio Aguero on Saturday.

Manchester City travel to Upton Park having beaten them four times last season while scoring a total of 15 goals - while Aguero has taken his tally for this campaign to nine goals from six games after netting four against Tottenham last weekend.

Allardyce rates the reigning Premier League champions as the best squad and team this season and picked out Aguero when musing over who is their best player.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is wary of Manchester City's visit to Upton park on Saturday

The Hammers were beaten 9-0 (on agg) by City in the semi-finals of last season's Capital One Cup

Speaking in his column for the Evening Standard, he said: 'It’s a tough question but I would have to plump for Sergio Aguero — because goals win you games — followed closely by Yaya Toure and Vincent Kompany because he will help you keep clean sheets.

'With Aguero, defenders think they have him marked but then suddenly, in a blur, he’s moved the ball, shot and it’s in the back of the net.

Allardyce is also an admirer of the qualities of Manchester City's Yaya Toure (L) and Vincent Kompany (R)

'Enner Valencia is a bit like that for us, hence the goal against Hull while Cristiano Ronaldo did something similar against Liverpool on Wednesday.

'That’s what top players do, they take you by surprise.

'What do I tell my defenders to do? Pray, because some things, as hard as you practice, are unstoppable.'
