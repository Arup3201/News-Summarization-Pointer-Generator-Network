Italy defender Ignazio Abate claims England's new wave have the quality to take the World Cup by storm.

The Italians knocked England out of Euro 2012 on penalties in the last eight but there is a feeling the two teams who meet in Manaus on Saturday may have moved in opposite directions since.

Cesare Prandelli’s team are misfiring. They have not won since September and were unable to beat minnows Luxembourg in a friendly last week.

Roy Hodgson’s team were held to a goalless draw by Honduras in Miami on Saturday but youngsters like Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley have added vibrancy and freshness.

'England have changed a lot,' said AC Milan full-back Abate. 'They have created a good mix and they could be the revelation of this World Cup.

'It will be a very difficult match, but I am convinced we will arrive in the best physical and mental condition. We need to erase what has been done previously and start again with great humility.

'At the Euros we started with a lot of scepticism, no-one bet a Euro on us, but we got to the final thanks to our desire to surprise.

'That should be the task in the World Cup too. We can’t think we are a great team who can play within itself or wait for an individual to come up with the goods.

'As long as we don’t lose our humility and willingness to make sacrifices, we can cause anyone problems.'

Juventus centre-half Giorgio Chiellini recalls the performance against England, in Kiev, two years ago, as one of the best by the Italians in that tournament but echoed Abate’s view that Hodgson’s team had progressed.

'They have brought a group on, a Liverpool contingent, who have done very well,' said Chiellini.

'Maybe as individuals they have changed more compared to us, but their way of playing remains the same.

'It will be a tough match. Certainly, the weather factor will also be very important. Everyone has been scared of Manaus so we are curious to see what it’s like to play there.

'We will be ready. As soon as we finished against Luxembourg we couldn’t wait to get to Brazil and breathe the World Cup air.'
