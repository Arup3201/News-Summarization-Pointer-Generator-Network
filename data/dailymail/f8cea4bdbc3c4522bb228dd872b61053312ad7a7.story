10 years on: Why Arsenal were the greatest Premier League side

An air of trepidation descends upon Arsenal at Annual General Meeting time.

Manager Arsene Wenger, majority shareholder Stan Kroenke and chief executive Ivan Gazidis all sat on the top table, perched like sitting ducks, waiting for one disgruntled shareholder or supporter to unleash his or her wrath.

They needn’t have worried this time, though, as Thursday's AGM passed without serious incident.

ARSENAL v HULL

Kick-off: 3pm at the Emirates.

Arsenal should be looking forward to playing Steve Bruce’s men. 

In their last 12 Premier League visits to the capital, Hull have lost nine times and won just once. 

The good news for Hull fans? That win came this season at QPR.

There was no repeat of 2012’s angry affair when fans vented their fury at Gazidis and Kroenke before Wenger emerged as the club’s hero once more with a rousing call to arms.

Of course, last season’s euphoric FA Cup win has helped placate some supporters; no longer did they have the club’s near 10-year trophy drought to use as a battering ram on such occasions.

There are those who believe a solitary trophy since 2005 still isn’t good enough for a club of Arsenal’s stature.

However, but for one awkward question from an unhappy supporter asking Wenger why he failed to sign a new central defender during the summer transfer window, even Wenger’s biggest critics were far from vocal on Thursday.

Things, however, aren’t quite so serene at the club’s medical department back at their London Colney HQ.

Arsenal have nine first-team players unavailable for Saturday's clash against Hull City.

Wenger’s biggest concern is in defence, with Laurent Koscielny (achilles), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Calum Chambers (suspended) all unavailable for the repeat of last year’s FA Cup final. 

Virgil van Dijk is once again being tipped for a move to north London but any deal for the Celtic defender will have to wait until January.

Laurent Koscielny will miss the Hull game with an achilles problem, but Wenger says he doesn't need surgery

Koscielny’s long-term fitness is a major concern. His injury is a long-standing problem which has deteriorated in recent weeks.

‘It has got worse, he finds it difficult to play with at the moment,’ said Wenger, who insisted the France international does not require surgery.

‘If you wait for it to be better, it can be a short time. If you want to get rid of it completely, it is long term. We will monitor him and as soon as he can take enough pain again he will play.’

The fear is Koscielny’s injury could manifest into a problem that could see him miss months rather than weeks, leaving Wenger with the dilemma of whether to hand Koscielny an extended break or continue playing him and risk aggravating the injury further.

Koscielny’s absence means Wenger is almost certain to use left back Nacho Monreal as a makeshift central defender alongside Per Mertesacker against Hull in a back four that could also consist of rookie right back Hector Bellerin and Kieran Gibbs.

Arsenal’s lack of central defensive options merely gave weight to shareholder Nigel Payne’s question about why Wenger failed to sign a new defender following the exit of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona.

Given the opportunity to answer Mr Payne’s query by chairman Sir Chips Keswick, the Arsenal manager declined, much to the fan’s anger.

‘That was a disgrace. I asked a question which every Arsenal fan I know feels so strongly about, which is why we went into this season with a very vulnerable defence,’ said Mr Payne.

‘I wanted to know if funds were available to strengthen the defence. The chairman said they always backed the manager. He offered Arsene Wenger the chance to respond and he didn’t.’

Virgil van Dijk could be on his way to Arsenal in January as the Celtic defender has impressed

However, Wenger did explain how he plans to solve the club’s defender shortage in 2015.

Speaking at the start of the meeting, Wenger explained: ‘I agree we could have bought one more player but we didn’t find one.

‘But we will try in January to rectify that because we are a bit short because of the injuries we’ve had.’

Van Dijk is the leading candidate to fill the void.

Scouts have made regular checks on the former Holland Under 21 centre half, who was called into the senior squad for the first time last month, and Sportsmail understands the club failed in a £7million deadline-day attempt to land the 23-year-old.

The club, however, maintain an interest in Van Dijk and are primed to return for the Dutchman once the transfer window re-opens.

Hopefully, that will calm Mr Payne’s angst.

The big-money captures of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez over the past 14 months have helped dispel the theory from some supporters that the club’s board are happy to sit on vast cash reserves.

Around £25m will be made available to Wenger in January to help strengthen the squad.

But Gazidis, often the man left facing the brunt of hardline questioning at recent AGMs, sought to obliterate the notion that the club are holding back in the transfer market.

‘Inaccurate and superficial analysis leads to stories that we are hoarding a huge cash balance. That is simply not the case,’ insisted the club’s chief executive.

‘It’s quite untrue to suggest that the club is sitting on a huge cash pile which, for some unspecified reason, it refuses to use.’

Wenger will hope the remainder of the season is as smooth as the AGM.

Virgil van Dijk is a 23-year-old Dutch centre back who plays his football for Celtic. He’s been extensively scouted by a host of top English clubs.

What’s his pedigree? 

He came through the ranks at Willem II in Holland before moving to Groningen as a teenager, where he played in the same side as Southampton’s Dusan Tadic. He has played for the Dutch Under 19 and Under 21 sides and in 2013 he moved to Celtic for £2.6million. 

What kind of player is he? 

He’s 6ft 4in, so it’s no surprise to hear that he’s strong in the air. But he’s composed on the ball too. He’s particularly strong in one-on-one situations.

What else would we look out for? 

For a defender, he’s not exactly goal-shy. He’s already scored twice this season and last year hit one of the goals of the season in the Scottish Premiership, dribbling from inside his own half to score against St Johnstone.

Can he cut it at the top? 

Yes, at least according to Giovanni van Bronckhorst. The former Dutch star says Van Dijk can potentially be ‘the best central defender in Europe in the next few years.’
