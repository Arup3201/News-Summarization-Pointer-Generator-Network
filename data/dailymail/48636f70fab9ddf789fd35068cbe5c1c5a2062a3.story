Karen Danczuk is among the bookies’ favourites to be named the first elected mayor of Greater Manchester

‘Cleavage selfie’ star Karen Danczuk is among the bookies’ favourites to be named the first elected mayor of Greater Manchester.

The city’s political leaders agreed to hold an election for a directly-elected mayor in November as part of a £1billion devolution deal with the Government.

Bookies have made Karen – wife of campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk – an outsider to become the ‘Boris of the North’ by landing the job.

Other front-runners for the job include former Happy Mondays singer Bez and TV presenter Terry Christian, both 33/1, as well as film director Danny Boyle who is 25/1.

The current leader of Manchester council Sir Richard Leese is the 4/1 favourite to win the race with the authority’s chief executive Sir Howard Bernstein at 10/1.

Karen, who has become an internet sensation for posting revealing photographs of herself online, is 33/1 to get the job with the bookies Ladbrookes - only slightly longer odds than her husband, who is 20/1 to land the post.

The Rochdale councillor has even joked she may run for the job, tweeting earlier: “Might put a bet on myself lol. KD.”

The 31-year-old mother-of-two has brushed off criticism of her penchant for revealing photographs.

Just this week she sent a series of snaps showing off her generous cleavage from a beach in Spain.

Alongside one of the pictures, Cllr Danczuk wrote: 'OK so I couldn’t come to my favourite beach without taking a selfie!!'

Her actions haven't come without criticism. In October last year, she went on national television to defend her posting of revealing selfies.

Cllr Danczuk came head-to-head with notoriously outspoken journalist Janet Street-Porter on ITV's Loose Women.

The politician became embroiled in a discussion with Street-Porter about her self-taken snaps.

Karen said the photos were not a ‘big deal’ adding: 'They're just selfies, millions of people do it every day.

'I do a very stressful job so have a very long week, I get dressed up on a Friday night, take a selfie. Why not?'

At which point, Janet chimes in: 'Can I say why not? Because you're a councillor from Rochdale and Rochdale has reached the headlines in a very unfortunate way in the last few years.

'Firstly for the allegations of sex abuse, which your husband wrote a very good book about, and secondly because in 2012, nine men went to prison for having sex with girls who were groomed.'

Street-Porter continued: 'The young women of Rochdale look to you as a Labour councillor to be a role model whether you want it or not.

'I think you carry a responsibility as a female politician whether you intend to stand for parliament or not is another matter. But I feel ashamed that you think that getting your assets out on a Friday night and posting a picture once it's been picked up by anybody.

'What kind of role model are you offering a 15-year-old girl in Rochdale?'.

The 31-year-old replied: 'I don't think you can blame the whole sex grooming scandal on me.

Street-Porter replies: 'I'm not blaming it, but going forward from that...'

Karen interrupts: 'We need to move away from the belief that if you have a low-cut top on, you are a target, you are not. Women should be able to wear what they want, when they want.

'The people of Rochdale are very proud of me at the moment and they are so excited that I am sat here today.'

She was also embroiled in a furious online Twitter spat with the former Tory MP Louise Mensch over pictures of her cleavage.
