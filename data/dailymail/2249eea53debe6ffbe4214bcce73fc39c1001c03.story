In the minutes after Manchester City’s 5-1 thumping of Tottenham, Manuel Pellegrini was asked about the ethics of paying £233m in salaries.

‘I don’t know what you’re telling me, but after the game is not the time to talk about other things,’ he claimed.

In other words, Manchester City’s manager isn’t interested in pay packets and FFP. Pellegrini has been brought in to win trophies with this team.

Feed The Beast... Alvaro Negredo has become a fans' favourite at the Etihad Stadium

Manchester City have scored 115 goals so far this season in all competitions - so could they really score 200 by the end of it?

UNTIL NOW

115 goals in 37 games, which is 3.1 goals per game

TO GO

15 Premier League games

Capital One Cup final

Four potential FA Cup matches (not inc replays)

Seven potential Champions League matches

Total: 27

So if they continue at their current rate, they will finish with...

198 goals

Still, if anyone can...

Undoubtedly he will do that now that there is equilibrium, charging towards the Barclays Premier League title after another night of shock and awe at White Hart Lane.

‘They are the best team in this league by a country mile,’ was Tim Sherwood’s typically brutal and honest assessment.

Tottenham’s manager should know because he has experienced victory at Manchester United and defeat at Arsenal in his opening weeks in charge.

Suddenly the pre-season chatter of chief executive Ferran Soriano, when he demanded five trophies in five years from City’s new manager, seems cautious.

They look and feel as though they could clean up as they go about their business, targeting a Quadruple after banging in 115 goals. Before the season is out, they could yet reach 200. 

Chelsea are next, the team who beat them in the final minute at Stamford Bridge when Joe Hart came haring out of his penalty area on October 27. Much has changed since then.

They have settled down, utilising the talents of Jesus Navas, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo during this jaw-dropping season.  Navas and Silva were exceptional at Spurs, grandmasters when it comes to one touch football of either boot.  On Wednesday, as they darted past Mousa Dembele, Nabil Bentaleb, Aaron Lennon and Gylfi Sigurdsson, it was easy to become transfixed by them.

Me again: Sergio Aguero was among the goals again as he opened the scoring against Tottenham

City's 115 goals have come from 12 different players this season. Unsurprisingly, strikers Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo are leading the way but the midfielders have been pulling their weight too - most notably, Yaya Toure has netted 15 times already.

Centre back and captain Vincent Kompany is among the goals as well, scoring three times from defence. He isn't the highest-scoring defender at City though. Aleksandar Kolarov has four goals from left back.

1. Sergio Aguero 26

2. Alvaro Negredo 23

3. Edin Dzeko 17

4. Yaya Toure 15

5. Jesus Navas 5

6. Samir Nasri 5

7. David Silva 5

8. Aleksandar Kolarov 4

9. Fernandinho 3

10. Stevan Jovetic 3

11. Vincent Kompany 3

12. James Milner 2

City are top, striding clear of Arsenal and Chelsea after their magnificent performance at Spurs. It will be difficult to topple them now.

They are so powerful, using 22 players in their Capital One Cup run alone, but the Premier League is the principle target for these players.

‘If you want to challenge for titles we have to be ready for the weeks and months when there are important matches,’ admitted Navas.

‘We are top of the table and on Monday we have a really important match against Chelsea.

‘Obviously there is pressure. We want to win the title, but there is nothing to worry about.

‘We are enjoying it a lo, not only the players, but the fans as well.’ The 3,000 or so who made the long trip down to London on Wednesday know they are witnessing something special at City.

The antagonism established among players and management under Roberto Mancini has been replaced by a special bond on the sidelines.

After the opening goal on Wednesday, when Sergio Aguero put City in front after 15 minutes, the management team all celebrated together.

They knew as early as then that they were heading for the top of the table and few will be able to live with them in the remaining 15 matches of the Premier League season.

There is an aura about them now and on Monday night, when Chelsea arrive in town, City have their 100 per cent home record at the Etihad to protect in the league.

They are a free-scoring team, putting 11 past the France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in two chastening experiences for Tottenham.

‘The difference between City last season and this season is that every player is playing for the team,’ claimed Lloris.

‘When you have a squad like that, with that quality, everybody is thinking about the team, and the have the potential to win the Champions League. For me they should be the winners of the League.’ 

On Monday evening, when Mourinho pitches up, we get to find out what City are really made of.
