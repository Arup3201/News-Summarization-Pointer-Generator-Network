If Michael's lucky number wasn't 15 it certainly is now.

Michael - who did not give his surname - missed the Sydney siege at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe by just 15 minutes and his receipt was number 183.

15 minutes. That's all that separated the barrister from being amongst the terrified cafe customers fearing for their lives in a hostage crisis that has brought Sydney to a standstill.

'The guy who served me ... no doubt [is] being held hostage, which is tragic,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald Herald.

'If I had been there 15 minutes later I would have been held up for sure.' 

Michael explained that it was a relatively quiet morning when he placed his order for a takeaway  Mocha coffee at 9.22am. He explained he bumped into a female client, and so hung around for a few minutes longer. 

The morning had started normally and he'd noticed that there were two employees working at the coffee section, which was standard.

'It wasn't what I would consider to be busy. Sometimes there is a queue to get a table. But no one was waiting for a table,' he said.

However, the situation could have been much worse if the incident had unfolded 24 hours earlier, or even an hour earlier, as much more people were in the cafe at those times.

The cafe was packed with people for the weekend pre-Christmas rush on Sunday, and it's generally much busier an hour earlier as workers look to get coffee before starting their jobs in Sydney's CBD at 9am. 

'If they had gone in even at 8.30 [this morning], it would have been a lot busier because a lot of people get their stuff before they go to 9 o'clock work,' Michael said.
