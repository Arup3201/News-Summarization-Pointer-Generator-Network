The father of Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o has revealed how the 12 Years A Slave actress's family suffered real brutality and torture in Kenya.

Miss Nyong'o won both awards and critical praise for her performance as Patsey in director Steve McQueen's harrowing film in which her character appeared in some of the most shocking scenes, but her own family were also the victims of harassment, violence and even murder.

As an opponent of former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, the actress's father Peter Anyang Nyong'o was tortured repeatedly, while her uncle Charles Nyong'o's body was never found after he was attacked on board a ferry and hurled off the ship.

Peter Nyong'o, now a leading Kenyan politician
 who serves on the country's Senate, has now revealed the true extent of
 family's brutal treatment, which led to them having to flee to Mexico 
where Lupita was born in March 1983.

Mr Nyong'o said he had struggled to 
watch his daughter's acting triumph, but added that his own experiences 
pale in comparison to Solomon Northup, played in the historical drama by
 British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor.

'We
 were put into prison and the torture chambers by the regime, but it was
 like a dinner party when you compare it to what the slaves went 
through,' he told the Independent On Sunday.

Mr
 Nyong'o said that his brother Charles had vanished in 1980, two years 
after Mr Moi came to power, and at a time which Mr Nyong'o described as 
being 'difficult' politically.

His body was never recovered and no one has ever been brought to justice for the killing.

'Even now, no information has come to 
light. I know he was on a ferry in Mombasa and witnesses who I managed 
to talk to told me clearly that it was not an accident and he had been 
attacked and pushed off the ferry. But the witnesses were too terrified 
to testify to the police,' he said. 

Mr
 Nyong'o said he had spoken to members of the Kenyan Special Branch and 
although he was told by one that they knew what happened the force were 
unwilling to help him.

Academic
 Mr Nyong'o, who is Secretary-General of Kenya's Orange Democratic 
Movement and has been the Kenyan Minister for Medical Services since 
2008, said he believes his brother was attacked because of his own 
opposition to Moi's rule.

Investigators
 believe Moi and his allies plundered more than £3 billion from Kenya's 
coffers during his 24-year rule, and he was known to have used the 
country's security services to kill and torture critics of his regime.

Mr
 Nyong'o and wife Dorothy were forced to leave Kenya for Mexico, where 
he found work at  El Colegio de México as a visiting lecturer in 
political science, and where his daughter was born.

On
 the family's return to Kenya in 1987 they had to go into hiding at a 
number of safe houses because Mr Nyong'o, who was trying to set up an 
underground democratic party, became the victim of harassment and 
arrest.

As a young girl 
Lupita and her five brothers and sisters had to move with their parents 
from place to place, with her father often taken into police custody on a
 weekly basis, while the rest of the family were the victims of 
threatening phone calls.

Mr Nyong'o said he thought that his 
daughter's insecure upbringing and constant need to adapt to new 
surroundings may have helped her to take on some of the transformative 
skills needed to become an actor.

Both
 Mr Nyong'o and his wife travelled from Kenya to attend the Oscars 
ceremony where his daughter took home the Best Supporting Actress award,
 and he described her performance in 12 Years A Slave as 'tremendous'.

He
 said: 'Lupita called me to tell me [when she was] nominated. She was 
really touched that she had done well enough to be nominated. It was a 
great achievement in its own right.'
