If Liverpool were to continue in their current vein of form for the remainder of the season, they might only just avoid relegation.

Brendan Rodgers' side have averaged just 1.16 points per game in the 2014-15 Premier League, which puts them on course to earn 44 points.

That kind of tally would have put them just 11 points outside the drop zone last season, and eight outside it the year before.

Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool side have lost their last four games in all competitions

However, given that 40 points is seen as the 'magic' marker for team down the bottom, it could be more uncomfortable for Rodgers' men if they don't buck up their ideas.Â 

If Liverpool are hoping to make the top four again this campaign, they need to win roughly 2.5 points per game for the rest of the season - a feat they didn't even manage last year when they had the free-scoring Luis Suarez.

Similarly, Arsenal could be set for their first mid-table finish since 1995 if performances don't improve.

The Gunners' current points per game rate is 1.41, which would give them a total of 53.5. That figure would have earned them ninth place last season.

If Arsenal's form were to continue as it was they would finish ninth based on last season's points totals

Arsenal have had some reasonable patches this season but have failed to turn that into points

Arsene Wenger's side might need to win roughly 2.3 points per game if they want their customary Champions League spot.

One team that can afford to be pleased with their performances, though, is Chelsea. Jose Mourinho's side are currently picking up a staggering 2.6 points per game.Â 

If they carry on at that rate they will end the season on 98.8 points, which would break the current Premier League record.

Even if Manchester City were to win as many points as they did last year (86), at this rate Chelsea would still be champions by Easter.
