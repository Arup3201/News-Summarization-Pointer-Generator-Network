Health problems: Steve Jobs, pictured in February 2011, has been battling pancreatic cancer

Steve Jobs has resigned as CEO of Apple Inc in a stunning move that ended his 14-year reign at the technology giant he co-founded in a garage.

In a letter to the board of directors, he hinted at his on-going battle with pancreatic cancer as the reason, saying: 'I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet 
my duties and expectations as Appleâ€™s CEO, I would be the first to let 
you know.'

He named COO Tim Cook as his successor and said he looks forward to watching the company which he nourished and made into one of the world's most powerful and recognised brands.

Jobs will remain in position as board chairman and is simply relinquishing his seat as CEO.

Apple shares were suspended from trade before the announcement. They had lost more than six per cent yesterday, and lost a further 2.3 per cent in pre-market trading today.

Analysts reminded market investors the news was expected due to Mr Jobs' ill health and it was 'positive' that he would remain as chairman and continue to influence the company.

Apple board member Art Levinson, 
chairman of Genentech, issued the following statement on behalf of the 
Apple board: 'Steve's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple 
and guided it to its position as the world's most innovative and 
valuable technology company.

'Steve
 has made countless contributions to Apple's success, and he has 
attracted and inspired Apple's immensely creative employees and world 
class executive team.

'In his new role as Chairman of the Board, Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration.'

The industry icon, who has been on medical leave since January 17, only briefly emerged in March to unveil the iPad 2. He later attended a dinner hosted by President Barack Obama for technology leaders in Silicon Valley.

Jobs, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and underwent surgery, began to
 grow noticeably gaunt in 2009 and pulled out of appearances, 
prompting fears that he was seriously ill.

But
 he denied rumours, releasing a statement saying it was simply a 
'hormone imbalance that was robbing his body of the proteins it needs'.

It
 was then, on 5 January, 2009, that he promised: 'I will be the first 
one to step up and tell our Board of Directors if I can no longer 
continue to fulfil my duties as Apple's CEO.'

He received a liver transplant that same year.

Though his resignation letter was short and to 
the point, it was obviously full of emotion as he thanked 'the best 
friends he made for life' at the billion dollar company.

He
 is seen as the heart and soul of Apple, with analysts and investors 
repeatedly expressing concern over how the company, based in Cupertino, California,
 would handle his departure.

BGC Financial
 analyst Colin Gillis said today: 'I will say to investors: don't panic and remain calm, it's the right 
thing to do. Steve will be chairman and Cook is CEO.

Tim Cook already has extensive experience running the company having all but taken over from Jobs while he was on medical leave.

He has served as Apple's chief operating officer for seven years.

Long
 considered a front-runner to replace Jobs, Cook joined Apple in 1998 as
 a senior vice president of worldwide operations and was promoted to 
chief operating officer in 2004.

Before
 joining Apple, Cook briefly served as an executive at Compaq and spent 
12 years at IBM, where he ran manufacturing and operations for the 
company's PC business.

He
 is credited with completely restructuring Apple's manufacturing 
operations, insisting that Apple shut down its overseas factories and 
farm out the work to third-party manufacturers. As a result, the company
 reduced inventory and improved margins on its entire product lineup.

He
 has served as Jobs' right-hand man at shareholder events and has 
completely handled earnings calls with analysts for last few years.

While
 Jobs was on medical leave from January to June 2009, Apple delivered 
two back-to-back blow-out quarters, as well as an updated iPhone OS, and
 new iPhone 3GS hardware.

For
 his performance, Apple's board rewarded Cook with a $5million bonus as
 well as 75,000 restricted stock units as a thank-you for 'his 
outstanding performance'.

To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:

I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer 
meet my duties and expectations as Appleâ€™s CEO, I would be the first to 
let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.

I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board
 sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.

As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.

I believe Appleâ€™s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of 
it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a 
new role.

I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I 
thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.
Steve

'But Tim has been de facto chief 
executive for some time and the company has been hugely successful. The 
vision and the roadmap is intact.'

Tim
 Cook ran Apple when Jobs went on medical leave and has essentially been
 running day-to-day operations since early this year, with the company 
racking up record revenue and profit.

Mr
 Cook was previously responsible for Apple's worldwide sales and 
operations, including management of the supply chain, sales activities, 
and service and support in all markets and countries, according to ABC.

He has been at the company since 1998
 and was recently given a $5million bonus as well as 75,000 restricted 
stock units as a thank you for his 'outstanding performance'.

Apple officially  became the most 
valuable company in America this month and is now worth $338billion, 
$1billion more than Exxon Mobil.

It was confirmed in February that 
Jobs was receiving treatment for cancer after the 56-year-old's gaunt 
appearance fuelled rumours that he might resign any day.

Pancreatic
 cancers are generally some of the most lethal of all tumours, and the 
most common type often kills within six months.

Jobs
 has battled a less common variety that grows far more slowly and 
develops in the hormone-secreting section of the pancreas, according to 
USA Today.

Although diagnosed in 2003, his illness was not disclosed until the following year, after he'd had surgery.

The
 fiercely private CEO has said relatively little about his health 
problems, although he did acknowledge his bout with cancer during a 
commencement speech at Stanford University, saying: 'No one wants to 
die. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever 
escaped it.'

In June, Jobs 
got a standing ovation at a software developers' conference in San 
Francisco to introduce an operating system called Lion and a wireless 
service called iCloud.

From the conference people tweeted that he looked 'gaunt', 'exasperated' and 'very ill'.

He
 stayed on stage for only three minutes before handing it over to Phil 
Schiller, Apple's senior vice president for worldwide marketing.

He demonstrated how photos taken with an iPhone were visible on a user's iPad moments later.

The
 iPhone 5 is due to hit the shops in September with almost 40 per cent 
of Apple customers saying they would buy it even before they had set 
eyes on it.

As news of Jobs' resignation spread, Twitter and Facebook exploded with tributes to him.

Teresa Kopec tweeted: 'Few *things* have given me more sheer pleasure to own than iPods, iPads, & iPhones. I'll miss your brain Steve Jobs.'

SusaNorlean wrote: 'Very sad hearing about Steve Jobs. That can't be good news about his health.'

Late Will posted: 'Steve Jobs proves all the money in the world means NOTHING if you're not healthy. Take the time to take care of yourself.'

Others worried about the future of Apple without its mastermind behind it.
