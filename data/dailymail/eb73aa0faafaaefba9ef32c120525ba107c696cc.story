Roy Hodgson has revealed that Danny Welbeck has been added to the growing list of injuries as the England boss prepares to take a depleted squad to Turin to face Italy on Tuesday.

Welbeck played a leading role for England as they kept up their winning start to the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a 4-0 win against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday.

The Arsenal forward scored one and had a huge hand in another as he justified his selection afterbeing given the nod over new-boy Harry Kane. 

However, the night may have come at a cost after Danny Welbeck picked up a knee injury.

Likewise, Hodgson revealed Sterling is set to have a injection to clear up a niggling toe injury, which will rule him out of the trip to Turin.

'We've had two blows as I've always known that Raheem Sterling has been waiting for an injection in his toe, he's been playing with that injury for a while now.

Leighton Baines will also be unavailable next Tuesday and will return to Everton

Roy Hodgson revealed Ryan Bertrand will join up with the squad to replace Baines 

'He's done ever so well but I always knew the situation and agreed with he and Brendan Rodgers that he would play tonight's game, which is the qualifier but then he would have the injection.

'So if we lose both of them that is a blow. Not only as they both played very well tonight but because they're an important part of the system that we're trying to play.

'We've still got enough players and it will be a chance for somebody else.'

Meanwhile, Hodgson revealed defender Leighton Baines will return to Everton and will be replaced Southampton left-back Ryan Bertrand ahead of the trip to Turin.

James Milner will also leave the squad owing to a knee injury.
