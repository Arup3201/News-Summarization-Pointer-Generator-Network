Teenager Michael Disley was left with these horrific injuries after he was attacked for the second time in eight months on the same road

Mr Disley,  who has learning difficulties and Asperger Syndrome, has now been left scared to go out alone following the latest attack on June 4 when he was targeted by thugs who hit his head against the pavement

The teenager, who lives an independent life, was walking along a road in Wigan, Greater Manchester, to his mother's house when two men pushed him to the ground and attacked him.

He said: 'I’m really scared to go outside without someone I can trust.

'I don’t know why I was attacked on either occasion, I had my backpack with me and they didn’t try and steal anything.

'They just wanted to hurt me.'

The assault comes just eight months after Mr Disley was chased by three men who cornered him in a house before beating him up.

The men were arrested for the attack before being released without charge after apologising to Mr Disley.

Lancaster Road, in Wigan, to come forward

His stepfather Les Watkinson said: 'When they arrested the other men for the first attack it didn’t get to court because they apologised.

'It cost Michael £140 for a new pair of glasses and now he has to go through it all again because they smashed them again.

'We said to the police this time that we’re not letting this one go even if it’s just to pay for his glasses.

'Michael is a vulnerable adult, he has learning difficulties and Asperger’s which is why he’s being targeted.'

Mr Disley does not know who attacked him in the most recent incident as the men did not speak during the assault.

He said: 'I was just walking back to my mum’s house when I felt something from behind.

'I just kept walking and then suddenly someone jumped me and I just went down. My face hit the pavement and as I lifted my head back up, they punched me back down again and again.

'It scared me last time but I got over it and now it has happened again. I got my own place but my mum wants me to stay at her house for a bit now, and I’ve been getting lifts to and from my friends now so I’m safe.

'Before these attacks, we never really had anything too bad. I used to just go to the skating rink and no-one had problems with me. I had silly name calling but that didn’t get to me.'

Mr Disley has now temporarily moved back in with his mother and stepfather.

His mother Diane Disley said: 'We dont want to bad-mouth the police because we were just lucky they were there but something needs to be done.

'He’s not a trouble-maker, he doesn't have a fighting bone in his body which is why he can’t defend himself.

'They know Michael and know he’s not a fighter so they will get a kick out of that and he’s targeted because of his disability. It’s just sick isnt it?

'We just want anyone who saw anything that night to come forward now and help catch those responsible.

'All he wants to do is lead a full and independent life but now feels he is being prevented from doing so.'

Police are appealing for anyone who may have seen anything in the Lancaster Road area of Wigan to come forward.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'At 11.55pm, officers were alerted to a man who said he was going to his mum’s when two men pushed him to the ground from behind.

'When he tried to get up, they punched him back down. Unfortunately he can’t identify anyone and there is no CCTV showing the assault.

'We are appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time to come forward and help find those responsible.'
