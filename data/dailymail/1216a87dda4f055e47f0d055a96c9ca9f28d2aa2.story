The toll of Falklands veterans who have killed themselves since the war ended has been laid bare.

An authoritative study of the emotional and mental cost of the conflict discovered 95 troops who fought in the South Atlantic had committed suicide since 1982.

But while grim, the findings undermined the claim made by The South Atlantic Medal Association in 2002 that more Falklands veterans had taken their own life than the 255 soldiers who died on the battlefield.

The South Atlantic Medal Association 
had said in 2002 it was ‘almost certain’ the number of suicides exceeded
the conflict death toll.

But campaigners insisted it still 
proved more needed to be done to tackle post-traumatic stress disorder 
and mental illness caused by horrors of war.

Commodore Andrew Cameron, chief 
executive of veterans’ mental health charity Combat Stress, said: ‘The 
number of Falkland war suicides this study reveals is too many

‘Indeed, any suicide which is directly linked to service in the Armed Forces is too many.

‘But what this study does, for the 
first time, is help us understand the needs of veterans and impact of 
psychological injuries long after the guns fall silent.

‘What we see is quite a lot of 
veterans who talk about or are concerned about suicide. They don’t 
follow through but it is still a cry for help.’

Military charities believe the UK is 
facing a ‘ticking timebomb’ of ex-servicemen who are suffering 
potentially life-changing mental disorders following intense conflicts.

In January, ex-Para Stephen Hood – who featured in iconic film footage celebrating victory at the battle of Goose Green – was found died six miles from his home in Rhyl, North Wales.

The father-of-two went missing as news bulletins were featuring the latest demands by President de Kirchner for Britain to surrender the Falklands.

Television reports included the Goose Green footage of Hood and fellow paratroopers. He was shown smiling at the camera and drinking from a bottle of Bacardi.

The same clip featured in the 2006 film This Is England and The Iron Lady, the 2011 film about former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

Hood served with 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment in the Falklands, and previously in Northern Ireland.

Troops who do not get help for mental 
illnesses often face problems including homelessness, social exclusion, 
mental health problems, drug and alcohol abuse and fall into crime.

The Ministry of Defence announced in 
2010 that it would investigate the circumstances of 21,432 Falklands 
veterans three decades after the war.

The aim was to find out whether suicide rates were more common than in the general population.

The study, up to the end of December 
2012, found that 1,335 Falklands troops had died, compared to an 
estimated 2,079 deaths if they had experienced the same mortality rate 
as the general UK population. It meant the veterans had a 36 per cent 
lower risk of dying.

Of those Falklands veterans, 95 - or 7 per cent - had killed themselves or a coroner had recorded an open verdict.

That meant the veterans were 35 per cent less likely to kill themselves than the general population over the three decades.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘Every suicide 
is a tragedy and our thoughts remain with the families and relatives of 
all those lost who bravely served in the Falklands conflict.

‘Whilst this extensive study suggests 
that the rate of suicide amongst those who served in the conflict is in 
fact lower than the UK civilian population we are clear that the mental 
health of our personnel and veterans remains a top priority.’

He said the Government had committed 
£7.2million to improve mental health support for military personnel, 
including creating a 24-hour helpline in conjunction with Combat Stress.

The spokesman added: ‘We would 
encourage any Falklands veterans or serving personnel who need help to 
come forward to access the wide range of support available.’

Veterans or their families can call the helpline on 0800 138 1619.
