Tim Sherwood has told Carles Gil to prove on the training pitches he is worth a starting place for Aston Villa.

The Spanish winger, bought for £3.25m by Paul Lambert in the January transfer window, has played one minute in the last three games.

Sherwood has preferred Scott Sinclair and Charles N’Zogbia but told the 22-year-old he could still feature in the season climax.

The Villa boss says the Spanish midfielder, signed for £3.25m in January, must prove his worth in training

‘I preferred someone else, it’s up to Carles to prove on the training field he warrants a place,’ said Sherwood. 

‘Everyone up for selection and has a chance to play until the end of the season. It’s my choice who plays and doesn’t. Everyone has to remember I am picking team to win a game but it’s nothing personal. 

‘I think Aston Villa are more capable of challenging towards the top half but we’re not in that situation. Who is best equipped to get out of a relegation battle? That is something I am still trying to decide.’
