Police are desperately searching for a 9-year-old boy believed to be abducted by his biological father and taken away from Seattle aboard his sailboat.

Billy Ginger Hanson was supposed to return to his mother in Pennsylvania last week after spending the summer with his father in Seattle, but the nine-year-old never made it home.

Investigators in Washington state suspect that Jeffrey Ford Hanson, 46, kidnapped his son and is now taking him on his boat to Mexico, the San Juan Islands or Tahiti. Other possible destinations include Hawaii, Alaska or Oregon.

Whisked away: Jeffrey Hanson, 46 (left), is suspected of abducting his 9-year-old son, Billy (right), two weeks ago to prevent him from returning home to his mother  

By land or by sea: Police say Hanson took his son away in his white 1976 Cooper sailboat named Draco, similar to the one pictured, and could be heading to Tahiti, Mexico or San Juan Islands 

The suspected abduction allegedly took place on or around August 28. Billy was scheduled to return home to Pennsylvania September 4.

Billy Hanson was last seen at Shilshole Bay Marina in Seattle. He is now listed as a missing endangered person.

The nine-year-old is described as 4 feet tall and weighing 90lbs, with curly brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing black knee-length shorts, but no shirt or shoes.

Investigators say that Jeffrey Hanson is a known drug addict with an 'extremely volatile' temper. He is described as a Caucasian man with blond hair and blue eyes, 5 feet 5 inches and weighing 160lbs.

He is the owner of a white 1976 Cooper sailboat dubbed Draco, which features a distinctive 6-inch red stripe on its side and Washington state license number WN6753NZ.

Last sighting: Bill Hanson was last seen August 28 at Shilshole Bay Marina in Seattle

Mr Hanson’s a neighbor has revealed to Q13 Fox News that the man is a very experienced sailor who has circumnavigated the globe on his own.

It has been suggested that Jeffrey Hanson is currently involved in a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife.

Anyone with information on the whereabouts of the father and son or the boat is asked to contact the FBI in Seattle at (206) 622-0460.
