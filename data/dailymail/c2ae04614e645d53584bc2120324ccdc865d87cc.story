Thieves are pocketing a staggering 2,000 smartphones a day in a national crimewave – and iPhones are the most likely to be stolen.

The flagship Apple devices make up the bulk of the 742,000 phones pinched across England and Wales over the past two years, a study shows.

The most recent iPhone models take the first four places in a new ‘most stolen’ league table aimed at encouraging owners to keep a closer eye on their valuables.

The next most popular phone among thieves is the BlackBerry 9790, while the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S3 and the HTC One X also feature in the top ten.

Police chiefs suspect that many phones are stolen to order by crime gangs who export them overseas – where they can fetch more than £500 each – and evade blocking technology which makes them useless in Britain.

In some cases the personal information on phones is harvested and passed on to other criminals, who use it for identity theft and fraud.

The figures were contained in a new report by the Government’s Behavioural Insights Team, sometimes dubbed the ‘Nudge Unit’. The findings were based on detailed crime data collected by the Metropolitan Police between August 2012 and January 2014.

Analysts discovered that the typical victim of phone theft is a woman aged between 14 and 24 who is pickpocketed or leaves her phone unguarded in a cafe or bar.

There were 742,000 victims of mobile phone theft in England and Wales during 2012 and 2013, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. In London alone last year, almost 100,000 mobile phone thefts were reported to the Metropolitan Police.

Manufacturers have introduced new measures to make their phones less attractive to thieves.

Many can be remotely locked and wiped if stolen or even traced using satellite tracking technology.

Home Secretary Theresa May said mobile phone theft remains a ‘concern’ despite the efforts of the industry to protect phones.

She added: ‘People are increasingly carrying their lives in their pockets, with bank details, emails and other sensitive personal information easily accessible through mobile phones. This is why it is vital that government, police and industry work together to tackle this crime. We are also working with industry to stop the reactivation of phones overseas, thereby killing the export market.’
