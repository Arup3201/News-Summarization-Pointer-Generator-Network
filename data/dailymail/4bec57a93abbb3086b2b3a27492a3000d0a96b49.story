The Louis van Gaal revolution has already started in earnest at Old Trafford - but the Manchester United boss is set to lavish another £150million on new recruitments next summer.

Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind all arrived in the summer for upwards of £150m but Van Gaal is nowhere near finished with reshaping his squad just yet.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the five players who top the United manager's wishlist for next summer...

KEVIN STROOTMAN (Roma) - Likely fee: £30m

Age: 24 (D.O.B. 13/02/90)

Position: Defensive midfielder

Teams: Sparta Rotterdam (2008-11), Utrecht (2011), PSV (2011-13), Roma (2013-)

Club appearances: 216

Club goals: 34 

Holland caps:25

International goals: 3 

The Roma midfielder, 24, might have been a United player already had he not suffered a knee injury in March and the club have retained a strong interest.

Van Gaal is a huge fan of the box-to-box midfielder and even resorted to completely overhauling Holland's formation at the World Cup to 3-5-2 from 4-3-3 due to the absence of who he considered to be the linchpin of his side. 

Strootman still remains very much a part of Van Gaal's plans going forward and, at just 24, he could become a mainstay in the United midfield.

His strong, powerful style should be perfectly suited to the Premier League and he is still being strongly courted by United.

DIEGO GODIN (Atletico Madrid) - Likely fee: £28.5m 

The experienced Atletico Madrid central defender, 28, is on United’s list of targets but they would have to trigger the £28.5m release clause in his contract if they want to sign him.

Godin was a mainstay in the Atletico side who won La Liga last season - as well as reaching the Champions League final, in which he scored.

The Uruguay star would bring some much needed knowledge and experience to a United back four which is seriously lacking in those departments.

MATS HUMMELS (Borussia Dortmund) - Likely fee: £32m 

Despite having been rebuffed in their advances for the Germany centre back last summer, Old Trafford paymasters are ready to try again.

Hummels is calm on the ball and, like Godin, would slot straight into the United side at the heart of their defence.

Dortmund have struggled this year, however, and sit bottom of the Bundesliga - so Hummels may soon look for pastures new. 

Age: 25 (D.O.B. 16/12/88)

Position: Centre back

Teams: Bayern Munich (2006-07), Borussia Dortmund (loan 2008-09, 2009-)

Club appearances: 280

Club goals: 25

Germany Caps:38

International Goals: 4

Age: 28 (D.O.B. 16/02/86)

Position: Centre back

Teams: Cerro (2003-06), Nacional (2006-07), Villareal (2007-10), Atletico Madrid (2010-)

Club appearances: 390

Club goals: 26

Uruguay Caps: 85

International Goals: 4

DANI ALVES (Barcelona) - Likely fee: Free

United want elite players and signing the 31-year-old Brazil right back, out of contract at Barca next summer, would be a coup.

Defensive reinforcements are what Van Gaal desperately needs and he could fill the problem right-back position for the club.

He is the ultimate modern-day full back - bombing forward at will and far strong going forward than in defence. 

ARJEN ROBBEN (Bayern Munich) - Likely fee: £20m 

Van Gaal has made little secret of his desire to be reunited with the Bayern Munich winger, 30, who was a key member of his Holland squad at the World Cup. 

Robben is settled in Munich and it remains to be seen whether he would be willing to up sticks and leave an established, dominant Bayern side under Pep Guardiola.

A midfield containing both Robben and Angel di Maria at United could be potentially mouthwatering, though. 

Age: 31 (D.O.B. 06/05/83)

Position: Right back

Teams: Bahia (2001-02), Sevilla (2002-08), Barcelona (2008-)

Club appearances: 580

Club goals: 38

Brazil Caps: 74

International Goals: 6

Age: 30 (D.O.B. 23/01/84)

Position: Centre back

Teams: Groningen (2000-02), PSV (2002-04), Chelsea (2004-07), Real Madrid (2007-09), Bayern Munich (2009-)

Club appearances: 458 Club goals: 161

Holland Caps: 86

International Goals: 28
