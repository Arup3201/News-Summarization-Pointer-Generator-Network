The family of Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson have hired a powerful attorney with a history of high-profile legal cases after angrily denying she was 'careless' in flying to Ohio and back while carrying the virus.

Amber Vinson, 29, who works at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas caught Ebola after helping to care for 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. 

Billy Martin is a D.C.-based trial lawyer who has represented Wesley Snipes during his tax case, NFL player Michael Vick while he fought dog-fighting charges and the mother of Monica Lewinsky during the Clinton sex scandal.

In a statement released by Miss Vinson's family on Sunday, they said the nurse would never 'knowingly' put anybody at risk, was vigilant in testing herself for signs, and followed all the relevant protocols.

The statement attacked any suggestion that she ignored medical or government guidelines.

The statement added: 'In the interest of Amber and our family, we have retained esteemed attorney Billy Martin to provide us with legal counsel during this unfortunate and troubling time.'

Miss Vinson flew from Dallas to Cleveland on October 10 and flew back on October 13. She was hospitalized with the virulent illness hours after her return last week.

In the wake of the nurse's trip to plan her upcoming wedding, 153 people are being monitored for signs of the disease, and three are in quarantine. 

Medical staff who care for patients with Ebola are allowed to fly provided they were wearing protective gear while dealing with the virus.

The statement said she reported her body temperature three times before boarding her flight home last week. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged Miss Vinson checked in repeatedly and was cleared for travel.

Cleveland station WOIO reported the family's statement and said that they feel public comments and media outlets 'mischaracterize Amber and her actions'.

It said: 'Suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful. 

'Although the majority of the correspondences we have received since her diagnosis have been positive, we are troubled by some of the negative public comments and media coverage that mischaracterize Amber and her actions

'To be clear, in no way was Amber careless prior to or after her exposure to Mr. Thomas Eric Duncan. She has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else.'

Three people have been quarantined in northeast Ohio following Vinson's visit to Cleveland to prepare for her wedding.

None of the three, quarantined after new monitoring guidelines by the state, has exhibited Ebola-like symptoms.

'Patient zero': Thomas Eric Duncan was the first person to die of Ebola in the United States. He brought the virus over from Liberia and died on October 8

Every day, the Ebola sufferers in the United States and their caregivers produce an astonishing eight 55-gallon barrels of medical waste PER DAY.

Masks, gloves, linens, utensils, medical instruments--everything the patient contacts must be destroyed and the garbage is piling up.

While one surefire way to destroy the pathogen is to incinerate the waste, some states have already said 'no way' to requests they accept the tainted garbage.

Missouri's attorney general has even made moves to bar Ebola-contaminated waste from being destroyed at a St. Louis facility, reports the LA Times.

Earlier this month, a Louisiana waste disposal site refused to accept the ashes generated when a Thomas Eric Duncan's belongings from his apartment were incinerated and a judge even signed an order temporarily blocking the disposal in the state.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a news conference that the virus is not considered to be hardy in the environment and that incineration and chemical treatment of the infected waste is sufficient to remove any risk.  

Initially, only Vinson's stepfather had been quarantined, in his home in suburban Akron. The two others, in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, and in Summit County, were quarantined after.

Ohio governor John Kasich ordered the new guidelines, which include travel restrictions, on Saturday. A state health official said the guidelines are meant to remove any chance of Ebola spreading.

'As we've seen, travel is a potential problem,' state epidemiologist Dr. Mary DiOrio said. 'It's why the people of Ohio are dealing with the situation we have right now.'

Under the guidelines, anyone who has had direct contact with the skin, mucus membranes, blood or bodily fluids of someone diagnosed with Ebola must be quarantined for 21 days.

Anyone who did not have direct skin contact but reported spending more than an hour in close proximity to an infected person is not to travel commercially for 21 days. 

Such people also are to seek permission to travel outside the health jurisdictions where they live. People who were in the same enclosed space as an Ebola carrier are not to travel outside the U.S.  

Ebola is spread through bodily fluids. Someone who is infected does not become contagious until he or she shows symptoms of the disease. Health officials have said Vinson exhibited some symptoms while in Ohio.

There are 153 people being monitored in Ohio because of contact or potential contact with Vinson. They include people with whom Vinson had direct contact, those who visited the Akron bridal shop where her bridesmaids tried on dresses on October 11 and those who were passengers on the flights she took.

Vinson is being cared for at a specialized unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Her family said she is a 'deeply committed nurse driven by a fundamental passion for helping others'.

One of Miss Vinson's Dallas hospital colleagues, 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham, also is being treated for Ebola.
