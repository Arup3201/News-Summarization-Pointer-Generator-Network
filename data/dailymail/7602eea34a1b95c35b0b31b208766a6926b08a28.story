The FBI invented a fake defendant as part of an elaborate sting operation to catch a 'corrupt' Philadelphia municipal judge, it today emerged.

Agents created a suspect named David Khoury, before staging his arrest and subsequent court appearances in a bid to bring down Judge Joseph Waters Jr.

Court documents show that Mr Khoury, 40, was arrested for illegally carrying an unloaded Glock .40-caliber pistol during a 2012 traffic stop in Holmesberg.

The suspect, who was actually an undercover federal agent, was booked on felony charges and released on a $50,000 bond with instructions to appear at court at a later date. 

He told officers he was from Louisville, Kentucky, but did not know his address and had no phone, yet the Social Security number he gave them appeared to have been issued in Texas in 1988,

Following his arrest, an unnamed campaign donor reportedly asked Waters to help Mr Khoury, describing him as a cousin of a business associate, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Two years earlier, the donor had given $1,000 to Waters's campaign, prompting the judge to say: 'You run into a problem with any of your people, you get ahold of me,' court filings reveal.

Waters then called Judge Dawn Segal, who was scheduled to hear Mr Khoury's case, identifying the defendant as a friend and asking her to help him, it is alleged.

Judge Segal later reduced Mr Khoruy's charge to a misdemeanor, before his case was dropped altogether when he failed to appear for trial and court staff had no address on file.

Earlier this week, Waters, who presided over hearings at Philadelphia's Criminal Justice Center, pleaded guilty to federal mail and wire fraud charges. 

Meanwhile, Judge Segal has been suspended from the bench by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, pending an investigation by the state's Judicial Conduct Board.

Last week, her lawyer Stuart L. Haimowitz said she made the ruling she thought was right at the time.

'She believed that her decision was the correct one,' he told the Inquirer. 'Whether it was a real case or a fake case, she would have ruled the same way.'

Prosecutors and defense lawyers who worked briefly on Mr Khoury's case said they barely remembered the man, and were not in on the FBI's sting operation.

'As I understand it, none of it was real. This whole sting was orchestrated,' Waters's attorney, Michael Engle, said.

The police report on Mr Khoury's arrest said the arresting officer, John Snyder, pulled him over in May 2012 for driving erratically on a busy stretch of Torresdale Avenue.

'When I approached the window, I asked him for his information,' Mr Snyder testified later at a hearing in the case.

'I noticed a black handgun on the floor mat area. I asked if he had a license to carry. He said, "no".' 

It remains unclear whether Snyder knew the case was a sting.

All that remains of Mr Khoury's case is a manila court file on an office shelf in the Philadelphia courts building. On it is a single green sticky note reading: 'Withdrawn - FBI'.
