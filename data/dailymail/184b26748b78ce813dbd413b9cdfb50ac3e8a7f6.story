Shares of Facebook were today plunging to all-time lows after the expiration of a lock-in period that have until now stopped early investors and insiders from selling.

The stock fell 7 percent, or $1.49, to $19.71 in Thursday morning trading.

If the stock hits $19, it will have lost half its value since Facebook went public in May.

Facebook's stock fell 7 percent, or $1.49, to $19.71 in Thursday morning trading. If the stock hits $19, it will have lost half its value since Facebook went public in May.

The firm has faced huge problems since going public.

After one of the most anticipated initial public stock offerings in history, Facebook Inc. suffered what some experts said was the most-botched IPO as trading glitches marred its first day.

In all, 271 million shares become eligible for sale Thursday, on top of the 421 million already trading.

Insiders say it is conceivable no one would sell those extra shares, but if too many do, Facebook's stock could decline even further.

Firms ranging from Accel Partners to Goldman Sachs, Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Facebook board members James Breyer, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman are among those free to sell stock they own

Facebook's operating chief Sheryl Sandberg and finance chief David Ebersman are also now eligible to sell stock they own.

Microsoft Corp., an early Facebook investor, is another one, though it's unlikely to sell because of partnerships it has with Facebook.

Facebook's share price could hits its lowest price today as investors will be eligible to sell stock as their 'lock in' period ends.

Lock-ups prevent company insiders from selling their shares in a 
newly-floated firm.

They usually start to expire 90 days from the initial
public offering (IPO).

They are designed to prevent the share price from fluctuating
wildly if too many investors decide to sell their shares all at once.

It's not yet known whether anyone had sold shares.

The stock price decline could reflect investor anticipation of such a move.

Other shareholders, including many Facebook employees, will be able to sell beginning in October.

On November 14, co-founder and chief 
executive Mark Zuckerberg will be able to sell shares.

Tom Forte, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, told the Guardian he expected more volatility in Facebook's share price in the short term.

I'm a glass half-full man on Facebook,' he said.

'In the near term I expect increasing pressure on the share price as more shares come unlocked.

'Holders may be unwilling to part with their shares at nearly half their IPO price but in the near term there are going to be more shares out there and not enough demand to pick them up,' he said.
