The billionaire Paul G. Allen said on Thursday that he would donate $100 million to the fight against Ebola, which has killed almost 5,000 people so far and crippled Western Africa.

Billionaire Paul Allen says he'll contribute at least $100 million to the fight against Ebola.

The Microsoft co-founder said Thursday that among the initiatives he's supporting is the development of two medevac containment units that the U.S. State Department can use to safely evacuate health workers who become infected.

Allen, who is worth more than $15billion, said he's working with the World Health Organization to increase its capacity for handling the logistics of transporting international aid workers, and he's establishing a fund to help cover the costs of emergency transportation of the workers.

Money will also go to the University of Massachusetts Medical School to help provide decontamination and lab equipment to Liberian hospitals, as well as community outreach and education in Liberia.

Allen's foundation previously pledged $26.5 million. He's urging people to give to the cause at www.tackleebola.com.

 The website aims to direct small donors to projects that need financing, like 6,000 hand-washing stations or beds for a center treating patients infected with the virus, and he is underwriting the administrative costs of the highlighted projects.

He also donated $2.8 million to the American Red Cross for its work on the outbreak.

The gift to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comes at a time when international groups, including Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization, have said resources to contain the epidemic and treat those affected are falling tragically short.

Fears:
 The Ebola virus has killed more than 4,800 people in Guinea, Liberia, 
Sierra Leone and Nigeria this year in the largest outbreak of the 
disease ever.  Above, a health worker sprays a man believed to be dying

Allen's donation joins that of the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation, which has pledged $50 million to United Nations agencies and 
other international groups to purchase supplies, such as protective gear
 for healthcare workers treating Ebola patients, and to expand the 
emergency response.

Allen said the donation from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation will help CDC establish emergency operations centers in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed about 2,300 people and shows no sign of slowing six months after it began. 

Allen said his foundation's gift would help CDC establish and equip emergency operations centers in the three most-affected countries, focusing on public health, not patient care.

The centers will use 'data management and communication systems for disease and patient contact tracing, to detect and stop the disease from spreading,' Allen said.

They will also expand lab testing to identify new outbreaks, and disseminate information about the epidemic to the public.

'A winnable battle should never be lost,' Allen said.

'Everybody feels called sometimes to really pursue a certain thing that resonates with them, and this has resonated with me,' Mr. Allen said.

He said when he first began hearing about the Ebola outbreak in July, he had a 'nagging sense' that it could spiral out of control. 

'We're up against an extremely tough opponent here,' he said. 'The exponential nature of the growth of this disease is really a challenge — we've already seen in the U.S. where one case quickly became two.'

Part of Mr. Allen’s money will go to the University of Massachusetts Medical School to underwrite training, medical workers and lab equipment in Liberia, where the public health system struggles for funding and many district hospitals are closed. 

The goal is to reopen these medical facilities so they not only can care for victims but also provide routine health care that has been all but abandoned during the crisis.

Currently
 the virus can only be transmitted through contact with a victim's 
bodily fluids, including blood, vomit, diarrhea and other secretions 

Back in the day: Paul Allen and Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1975 and rose to prominence as the personal computer gained a mass following beginning in the '80s

“I got a taste when I was in Kenya a while ago of what medical care was in rural Africa,” Mr. Allen said. “I was in a town of about 10,000 people, and a shipping container with a rusty microscope was their medical clinic.”

More of his money will help create a fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation designed to cover the gap between what insurance would cover should a medical professional need evacuation and the actual cost.

“This is really more about trying to attack every element of this problem,” Mr. Allen said. “This disease expands at an exponential rate, so there is a need for exponentially more health care workers.”

Since resigning from Microsoft in 1983, Allen has become a prominent philanthropist, supporting scientific research through the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

He has given awa some $1.5 billion of his wealth through a family foundation he established with his sister, Jody.

He also owns the Seattle Seahawks football team and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team.
