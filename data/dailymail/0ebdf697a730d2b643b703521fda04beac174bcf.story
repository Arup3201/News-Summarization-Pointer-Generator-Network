Worrying: Officials in New Zealand have released a list of bizarre baby names which were put forward by parents for their children but rejected (file picture)

Naming a child is one of the most difficult decisions faced by any new parents.

But it appears that not all parents take the responsibility as seriously as they should.

Officials in New Zealand have today released a list of baby names which were put forward by parents for their children but rejected by authorities.

As reported by the Daily Telegraph, the list of 77 names shows that the parents of one child wanted to call it 'Anal'.

Thankfully for the child, the Department of Internal Affairs turned down the proposed name.

Other suggested names on the list included 'Lucifer', 'Mafia No Fear' and 'Queen Victoria'.

One child was set to be called '.', as in 'full stop' until the authorities prevented it.

Other bizarre examples show that some parents appeared to have given up on thinking of a name for their child, with names '2nd', '3rd' or 5th' all put forward.

The name rejected most often was 'justice' which was turned down 62 times. Combinations on this including 'Juztice' and 'Justus' were also refused.

Rules in New Zealand prevent any child being given a name which implies that they hold a official title or rank. This has resulted in the names 'Princess' and 'King' being regularly rejected.

In 2008, a court in the country ordered that a girl called 'Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii' should have her name changed.

The judge in the case criticised parents who give their children odd names. He gave examples including 'Number 16 Bus Shelter' and twins called 'Benson' and 'Hedges'.
