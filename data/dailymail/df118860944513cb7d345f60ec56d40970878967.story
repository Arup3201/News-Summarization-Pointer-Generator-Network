Twins set to inherit tobacco heiress Doris Duke's $1 billion fortune were beaten, forced to eat their own feces and made to play Russian Roulette as children, they have claimed in a chilling interview.

Georgia and Patterson Inman, 16, spoke out in their first television interview on Thursday about how they endured years of abuse at the hands of caregivers hired by their meth-addicted father.

They lived with their father, Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr - Duke's nephew - until he overdosed in 2010. They now live with their 
mother, Daisha, and will inherit part of Duke's fortune when they 
turn 21.

Their stories of alleged abuse come in stark contrast to how their lives appeared - holidaying in Fiji, taking diamonds to school for show-and-tell and keeping exotic pets, such as camels and chimps.

Struggles: Twins Georgia and Patterson Inman, who are heirs to Dors Duke's tobacco fortune, have spoken out about the abuse they allegedly endured at the hands of their father and caretakers

'People see this luxurious life but at the same time we were living in hell,' Patterson told Dr Phil during the exclusive interview that aired on Thursday.

The alleged abuse began after their parents divorced and their father - who received an estimated $90,000 monthly inheritance - won custody in 2000, when the twins were two.

In the years to follow, they were burned with boiling water, forced to stay in a feces-filled basement, made to live for days without food and locked behind dead-bolted doors, they told Dr Phil.

Georgia recounted a putrid stink that permeated their Wyoming mansion and how they were fed stale food in a rat-infested home where babysitters would come and go.

Pain: Georgia shook as she said how she was allegedly burned, starved and forced to eat her own vomit

Fighter: Patterson said that he is determined to find the people who abused him and his sister

'They would play Russian roulette with
 us,' Georgia said of their caretakers. 'They thought it was funny. 
They'd load the gun, spin it and shoot it at me and my brother.'

She
claimed that they also tied her feet and taped her mouth and would force her to eat her own sick from the 
carpet.

'She got mad because I couldn't eat it,' she said of one woman paid to look after them. 'It kept making me sick. It was really disgusting.'

Her brother recalled another time the nannies made him eat his own feces.

'They were feeding me my own 
[expletive],' he said. 'I just remember being in the basement 
and they were like pretending it was food. They were like, "Chew! 
Chew!"'

On other occasions, Georgia said they threw her down a flight of stairs and locked them alone in the 
basement. They were also dropped into a boiling bathtub, she said.

Trying to move on: The teenagers said they are now happier - but that they will always have scars

'We
 got placed in hot water,' she said. 'It'd scold us really bad. I 
thought my skin was melting away. It feels like you're on fire.'

But Georgia said the abuse didn't just come at the hands of their caretakers.

While Patterson has fond memories of his father - blowing up vehicles, collecting guns and speaking to hookers aboard boats in New Zealand - Georgia's thoughts are not so happy.

She told Dr Phil that her father also beat them, punching them in their faces and heads. Her brother refused to speak about the claims.

'He would pick me up by the ankle and 
just drop me on my head because he wanted to make me stupid,' Georgia 
claimed. 'He used to slice my feet up with knives.'

They both claimed they saw their father overdose regularly and that adults had told them to revive him by splashing cold water on his face.

Patterson added that their friends' parents never wanted to bring their children to the home because of their dad's penchant for pornography and because he liked to walk around naked.

'[The money] didn't matter to me,' Georgia
 said. 'If someone were to look at me and say "wow", I would say let's 
try lives. I just wanted to be free. I was trapped because of it.'

She claimed that her father even gave people wads of cash to silence them when they saw the children being abused.

'There's no hope when that happens,' she said. 'I thought I was going to be dead.'

But they weren't just witnesses to their own abuse. In one particularly frightening episode when they were four years old, they saw a man killed in front of them, they said.

They were in a kitchen in Japan where a 
man endured a grim assault for stealing; their father warned them that 
they would be punished similarly if they ever stole.

'They put him on a chair,' Patterson recounted. 'They 
stripped him nude. They were sticking an object - bamboo - between the splits in the chair. They did it nice and slowly.'

The bamboo was placed inside the man and he was slowly speared to death, the twins said. Georgia added that a man also sliced open his stomach, leaving his intestines to fall out.

'I was scared, I was crying,' Patterson said, breaking down. 'I was terrified. I tried to grab on to my 
father. He brushed me away. I think this whole thing was about stealing. It really messed with my head a lot.'

Now the twins are hoping to bring their abusers - the babysitters who were paid to care for them as their father and stepmother abused drugs - to justice.

'I want these people to be put away,' 
Patterson said, beginning to smile. 'I want to see all these people in a
 jail cell with me giving a thumbs up.

'I'm pissed off. I'm coming after the bastards. This is a battle cry. This is serious. They're going down.

'Richest girl in the world': The twins are the great niece and nephew of American Heiress Doris Duke, pictured in the 1930s. Georgia Inman bears a striking resemblance to the tobacco heiress

Heiress: Duke is pictured with her first husband, financier James Cromwell. They had a daughter who died and Duke had no other children, so she left her fortune to her nephew, the twins' father

'I don't want to be a victim. I want to be a victor.'

Since the death of their father, the twins have not had an easy life.

Their money is currently locked up in a legal dispute between their mother Daisha - the fourth wife of Walker Inman Jr - and Mr Inman's fifth wife and their mother has made headlines on numerous occasions as she battles to get access to the children's money.

The trust is run by JPMorgan, who said in court filings last year that it had to reign in payments after the twins' mother requested exorbatant amounts to treat them.

Ms Inman has argued that the trustees have gone too far and neglected to pay the children's legitimate expenses.

An interview with the twins' mother will air on Dr Phil on Friday.
