Shocking footage has emerged from music festival Stereosonic of a young woman dancing topless in front of a crowd full of strangers.

While most girls at music festivals appear to wear as little as possible but still protect their modesty, the video shows the blonde woman, wearing nothing but a white pair of underwear on Saturday.

Festival goers are seen filming the woman with their mobile phones while she is seen prancing around and flicking her blonde locks in the air at one of the stages at Melbourne Showgrounds.

Shocking footage has emerged from music festival Stereosonic of a young woman dancing topless

As the music pumps around her, she dances to the beat and grabs her chest a number of times before pushing her hands into another woman, as though she was trying to keep her balance.

Lost in her own world, the partygoer continues to jump and spin around in circles while onlookers are heard in the background yelling out 'Facebook! Facebook!'

Still spinning, the young woman is seen with one leg flicked back before she plunges out of the frame, believed to have fallen over as revellers are heard yelling out 'WOW' as they run towards her.

The video, along with a caption 'Melbourne stereos goin nek [sic] level' was posted onto social media on Saturday night and has received almost 10,000 views.

It comes just a week after the music festival displayed a number of hilarious and the most shocking videos from the festival when it hit Sydney.

One man was seen dancing and throwing his arms around before pulling his wallet out of his pocket and confusing it as an iPhone.

Another video surfaced of a violent brawl between 20 well-built men throwing punches in the mosh pit

He fumbles and looks to be trying to 'swipe' his wallet before pulling out a credit card, thinking it is a camera and  starts taking photographs as he stares at it as if it has a screen.

But it wasn't all fun and games for some, after a video surfaced of a violent brawl between 20 well-built men throwing punches in the mosh pit of the stage at Sydney Showgrounds.

One man was knocked unconscious before security guards jumped in but appeared to have failed to stop the wild brawl as it continued to break out just seconds later.
