A young mother with two adopted Ethiopian children has shared the heart-melting story of when her autistic son was having a meltdown in Trader Joe's - and a store employee ran up and gave her flowers.

In a post for her blog, Lauren Casper - who lives with her family in Lexington, Virginia - said her young son Mareto was having a screaming temper tantrum while the family shopped at the grocery chain. As they rushed from the store, Mrs Casper said she felt 'close to tears' from embarrassment and wished they could be 'invisible to the people bustling around us.'

Just before Mrs Casper - who was also carrying her baby daughter Arsema at the time - reached the car, a young female employee approached her with a huge bouquet and said: 'I was adopted as a baby and it has been a wonderful thing. We need more families like yours.'

They can be a handful! Despite some bumps in the road, Mrs Casper calls her family's situation 'a dream come true'  

Mrs Casper said she had to stop herself from crying while thanking the woman, who patted her on the shoulder, told her that her family was beautiful and walked back into the store.

'My steps were much slower as I finally headed to the car with my arms full of flowers and tears that had spilled over onto my cheeks,' she wrote.

'On a day when I felt like we were the worst example of family... a day when I hoped no one noticed us... she did. But she didn't see what I assumed everyone was seeing. She didn't think what I assumed everyone was thinking. She saw beauty and love and hope and family. She thought we were wonderful and it made her smile.' 

Alas, Mrs Casper did not get the employee's name, but wishes now - two years later - she could go back to the store and tell her how meaningful her gift still is. 

'To the beautiful young woman in the parking lot of Trader Joe's... thank you from the bottom of my heart,' she said. 'You are a treasure.'

Sweet little guy! Mrs Casper and her son Mareto, who was having a meltdown in the Trader Joe's when the store employee came up and gave her flowers 

Mrs Casper and her husband John Casper, who's a pastor, met in college, married soon after and planned to have children right away.  

After a year of trying to conceive, Mrs Casper finally got pregnant, only to lose the baby a few months later. Again, she would get pregnant - and, again, she would miscarry. 

'Some people just can't have kids and you need to accept that,' said Mrs Casper, quoting her doctor, in a video about the family's story. 

The pair then became foster parents to twin two-year-old boys - and, a few months later, a judge ordered them to return to their families. 

'I'd had to say goodbye to all of our babies,'  Ms Casper said, through tears, 'and I just really needed one that I could keep.'

The Caspers then began the adoption process - and successfully adopted Mareto and Arsema within a few years. 

Though both of the children have unique needs (Mareto has autism and Arsema has a few missing and webbed fingers and toes), Mrs Casper calls their family's situation 'a dream come true.' 

'Life is very sweet and rich,' Mrs Casper said. 'This is all we've ever wanted. We're okay with whatever comes.'
