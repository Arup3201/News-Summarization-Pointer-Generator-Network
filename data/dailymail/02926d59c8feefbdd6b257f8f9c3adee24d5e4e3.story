More than 11,000 law-breaking cyclists were fined for riding on pavements and running red lights last year, damning new figures reveal today.

Statistics show more than 7,000 cyclists were fined for cycling on pavements while over 4,000 were caught jumping red lights and ignoring other road signs and markings.

Road safety and motoring groups welcomed the prosecutions over reckless and illegal behaviour.

They say cyclists are putting lives at risk – including their own - and should face the consequences stressing: ‘Cyclists are not above the law.’

Polling research and film evidence from taxi drivers suggests red-light running is too often the norm rather than the exception.

The evidence of reckless and illegal cycling is in sharp contrast to the loud calls of cycling campaign groups who demand crackdowns on motorists and the creation of safer road junctions.

And it adds concerns  among motorist that too many cyclists believe the  laws of the land should be rigorously enforced against drivers – but should not apply to them.

A hard-core of the most militant cyclists, criticised for their confrontational attitudes including verbal abuse and hitting or kicking cars,  have been dubbed ‘lycra-louts’ because of their tendency to be clad in the stretchy sports material.

Alarmingly, some road safety experts admitted privately to Mailonline that  they fear to speak out because of intimidation and protests from hard-line cycling militants and ‘fundamentalists.’

The frequency  with which cyclists are breaking the law emerged  after a series of Information Act requests by the Mailonline to police forces across England and Wales.

It found  that most of the offences were committed in London with 3,508 fixed penalty notices issued after cyclists  were caught jumping red lights. A further 6,173 tickets were issued after flouting the cyclists  flouted the law by riding on pavements.

Avon and Somerset police recorded a total of 525 cyclists who were fined for cycling on pavements while 177 were issued a ticket for jumping lights and contravening other road signs.

Officers in Cambridgeshire caught 48 cyclists cycling on pavements and 337 cyclists were caught ignoring red lights and other signs and markings. These include no entry signs, roundabout signs and box junctions.

Each fixed penalty  ticket carries a fine of £50. And  in total, 4,275 tickets were issued across the country for jumping red lights and ignoring other road signs. Some 7,194 were issued to cyclists for riding on pavements. But the actual number may be far higher as not all the forces answered the request for information.

The trend of red light-jumping comes despite a rise in the number of cyclists being killed on British roads this year.

Last year, 14 cyclists died in London - six in just two weeks. In 2012, 122 cyclists died across the UK.

Research by the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM)  shows that nearly six out of ten (57 per cent) cyclists admit to running red lights.with14 per cent doing so regularly or  sometimes. A quarter (24.9 per cent) say they do so ‘rarely’ and one in five (19.1 per cent) doing so ‘once or twice.’ Nearly three quarters(73 per cent) of cyclists admit to riding on the pavement.

A YouGov poll revealed that almost a quarter (24 per cent) of cyclists think it is acceptable to go through a red light if they can see the way ahead is clear. Nearly one in five (18 per cent) said they had jumped a traffic light in the past six months.

More than 60 per cent of people polled — including non-cyclists — said they thought it was common for cyclists to run a red light. Some 78 per cent said they should be prosecuted for such an offence.

Scores of cyclists were filmed jumping red lights by hidden cameras set up by London black cab drivers.

Their footage showed that just over half of riders  - 194 out of 364 - went through stop signals during the rush hour.

The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) which has 10,000 members,  recently set up hidden cameras at two ‘average’ crossroads to gather evidence between 7.30am and 8.30am  after a series of ‘near misses and confrontations’ between its members and cyclists.   The unedited film is available on YouTube.

LTDA general secretary Steve McNamara said: ‘We are constantly hearing  from the cycling lobbying groups that cyclists who ride on the pavement, weave in and out of traffic and fail to stop at red lights are a small minority or a small rogue element. This was in stark contrast to what we and most Londoners witness every day.’

The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) said cyclists’ illegal antics were reckless and putting lives at risk – including their own. It welcomed the prosecutions and urged police to do more.

IAM policy and research director Neil Greig said: ‘It is putting lives at risk. Cyclists are not above the law. If cyclists want to be taken seriously on the road they must also obey the law and the rules of the road.

‘We welcome the fact that the police are taking action against cyclists who break the law by running thorough red lights or cycling on the pavement in substantial numbers.  They have got to  expect the police to enforce the law if they break it.’

Against a background of cycling groups demanding millions of pounds of new investment to make roads and junctions safer for bicycle users, Mr Greig said:’Cyclists must play their part by behaving responsibly on the road and obeying the law. If they want to be taken seriously they must also behave responsibly towards pedestrians and other road users.’

AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ‘Road safety is a two-way street and the law applies equally to cyclists and motorists. That is the case whether it is a negligent and reckless driver or a negligent and reckless cyclist.’

A cyclist who knocked down a schoolgirl and left her for dead after jumping a red light at 30mph was jailed for a year last month.

Philip Benwell, 38, smashed into nine-year-old Leila Crofts as she stepped on to a pedestrian crossing. As she lay unconscious with a fractured skull, he climbed back on his bike and left the scene.

The cyclist had been speeding downhill with his ‘head down and bottom raised off the seat’ just as Leila and her au pair reached the crossing. Although the traffic lights were showing red, Benwell failed to stop and he was forced to try and swerve at the last moment when he realised he was about to hit Leila.  But he failed, and crashed into the schoolgirl, who lives in Sandbanks, Dorset.

She was thrown into the air and suffered a fractured skull when she landed in the road, spending 14 days in intensive care.

Benwell was initially charged with causing grievous bodily harm by ‘wanton and furious cycling’ under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. The charge, which he admitted, was later changed to causing GBH.

Judge Peter Johnson said Benwell had been ‘callous and selfish’ when he failed to stop.

He told the cyclist that he was totally to blame: ‘You were cycling at high speed. It’s clear that the light must have been red for a few seconds before you went through that crossing.

‘You went through that crossing so you did not have to brake and stop so you could use your momentum to get up the hill on the other side.

‘You are the only one who is to blame.

‘This was an incredibly selfish criminal act.’

Leila, whose father Darren Crofts is a company director, was being taken to the beach for the afternoon in July when she crossed the road at Branksome Chine.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation, said: ‘The rules of the road, and pavement, apply to those on two wheels as much as those on four. Given the relationship between drivers and cyclists is already often strained both groups have a duty to respect the law and hence each other.’

Worryingly a  number of road safety chiefs admitted privately to the Daily Mail that they are frightened of being too critical of cyclists and he cycling lobby  for fear of being  bullied, intimidated or ‘trolled’ – a form of internet cyber-bullying on social network sites like twitter and Facebook – by more militant cycling activists and hard-line ‘lycra louts'. 

‘It’s a real concern’, said one.’ There is a real fear of a backlash from the cycling fundamentalists. They don’t like anything that smacks of criticism. You will get trolled. The cycling lobby will be on your back and it can be  quite intimidating.’

Another noted: ’If you say something which the cycling lobby find even mildly critical you will  face a barrage of criticism on Twitter. ’
