Bill de Blasio's lobbyists called top political allies and asked them to publicly slam the NYPD unions and cops for turning their backs on the New York mayor at a funeral for a slain officer, it has been revealed. 

DNA Info quotes two lawmakers who go calls from the de Blasio's aides asking them to speak out against the NYPD for its protest.

'City Hall wanted me to blast the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association for turning their backs on him,' one politician told the news site.  

'They called up Monday, said they were calling all of us, and that it was our obligation to stand up defending the mayor.'

The angry lawmaker said the request, made to both state legislators from New York City and city council members, was 'not really appropriate.'  

Another politician confirmed he got a call, as well, according to DNA Info. 

A City Hall spokesman tried to cast the calls to legislators in a different light - saying the mayor's aide were simply asking for 'statements of support' for the families of two slain NYPD officers. 

DNA Info's source, who got the call, called City Hall's version of events 'preposterous.' 

The request to blast the unions came at the same time de Blasio was trying to set up a meeting with the five NYPD union heads to broker a truce. 

He sat down with then in Queens for two and a half hours on Tuesday, though the meeting seemed to do little to repair the broken relationship between City Hall and the NYPD rank-and-file.

Many NYPD cops are furious with the mayor for his sympathy toward protesters who rallied against alleged police brutality when a grand jury failed to indict an officer for the chokehold death of Eric Garner. 

De Blasio's remarks, including a statement that he had talked to his biracial son about the possibility he could be stopped by the NYPD, seemed to confirm long-held NYPD suspicions that he held anti-cop views. 

When two officers were gunned down on December 20 by a fanatic who claimed he was retaliating for Garner's death, the head of the largest NYPD union, Patrick Lynch, declared that de Blasio has 'blood on his hands.' 

NYPD cops turned their backs on the mayor when he visited the slain cops' families at the hospital. 

Then, at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos last weekend, dozens of officers were pictured refusing to face de Blasio when he took the podium.

Then, at NYPD academy graduation on Monday, the mayor was met by scattered boos and was heckled while he spoke.
