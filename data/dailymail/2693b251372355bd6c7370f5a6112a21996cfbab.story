Customs authorities have busted a man attempting to smuggle more than $50,000 worth of cocaine into the U.S. via homemade cookies.

Guatemalan man Mauricio Isidro Rivera Hernandez was stopped at the airport when customs officials decided to take a closer inspection at his delicious looking baking.

The three packs of cookies inside his check-in luggage revealed a hidden, and extremely valuable, stash of drugs.

The tasty looking homemade cookies were found to have more than $50,000 of cocaine stuffed inside them

The cookies were found to have 118 small pellets of cocaine jammed inside them with an estimated street value of more than $50,000.

Hernandez was arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport, in New York, on June 5 on a flight from Guatemala City when the discovery was made.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the drugs were found during a routine inspection of his luggage.

He has now been handed over to police and is facing drug smuggling charges.

Customs officials discovered the cocaine, worth more than $50,000, in the man's baking when he landed at Newark Liberty International Airport after disembarking a flight from Central America

Drug smugglers will use almost any method possible toÂ bring drugs into the U.S.

Only two days ago U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials stopped a man at John F. Kennedy International Airport whose luggage handle rails were surprisingly thick.

Disembarking a flight from Guyana, officials searched the man's luggage, and discovered a white powdery substance that tested positive for cocaine.

The amount of cocaine eventually seized had a street value of $82,000.

Director of CBP's New York Field Operations, Robert E. Perez, said the organisaton would remain vigilant in trying to prevent smuggling.

'CBP Officers continue to adapt to various concealment methods employed by these smugglers, and CBP remains ever vigilant in protecting the United States from the distribution of these dangerous drugs,' he said.
