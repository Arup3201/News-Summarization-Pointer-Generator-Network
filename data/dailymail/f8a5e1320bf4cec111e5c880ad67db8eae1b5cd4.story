A group of tourists in Philadelphia got the surprise of their lives after scaling the Rocky steps... a real-life meet and greet with Sylvester Stallone himself.

The three men ran up the 72 steps out of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, made famous by the boxing drama starring Hollywood veteran Sly.

And they received the shock of their lives when they found the actor and writer of the movies standing at the top.

A group of tourists scaled the Rocky steps in Philadelphia - and found Sylvester Stallone himself at the top

Stallone first made the stairs outside of the Philadelphia Museum of Art famous in his 1976 film, Rocky

Visitor Peter Rowe said: 'He said to us, ", you guys are fast. You're making me look bad."'

The group then asked the 68-year-old actor for a photo, to which he happily agreed.

'Look tough, guys,' he reportedly told them.

In the selfie, you can see Stallone holding up his first.

Today, tourists often run up the steps themselves to pose with the Rocky statue (right) located nearby

Stallone first made the art museum steps famous in the 1976 film, Rocky. Starring as fictional boxer, Rocky Balboa, his character used the steps as part of his training regimen.

Thousands of people visit the steps each year to recreate the run and take pictures with the Rocky Statue, which was a prop in the third film in the series, Rocky III.

The actor is currently in Philadelphia filming Creed, which is the latest installment in the Rocky series.

It also stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, the grandson of early Rocky foe, Apollo Creed.
