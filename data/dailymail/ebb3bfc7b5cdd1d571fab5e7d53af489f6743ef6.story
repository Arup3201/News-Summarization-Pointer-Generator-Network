Juan Mata has described playing with Wayne Rooney as a 'privilege' following the Manchester United captain's match-winning display against Newcastle on Boxing Day.

Despite playing in a midfield role, Rooney netted the first two and assisted Robin van Persie's third during the 3-1 victory, and Mata believes that he is more than capable of continuing to excel in a deeper position.

'I think he can play there, yes,' declared Mata in a post-match interview with MUTV. 'He can defend, he can attack, he can pass and he can score goals arriving into the box.

'For us, he is a very important player and I feel privileged to play with such a player as Wazza.'

Rooney has been moved into midfield of late to accommodate Van Persie and Radamel Falcao up front. And Mata  said he is enjoying playing alongside such an impressive array of attacking talent.

'I really enjoy playing with all players like that (Rooney, Falcao, van Persie). As strikers, they offer you a lot of movement so you can pass the ball to them,' he explained. 

Rooney then added his second goal of the game with half time approaching to double their advantage

With fixtures coming thick and fast over the festive period, Manchester United have little time to rest ahead of their next game, as they travel to face Tottenham less than 48 hours after their win over Newcastle.

And Mata has admitted that preparing physically for games in such a short space of time is a tough challenge. 

'We just want to keep playing well,' he continued. 'Physically it’s difficult [to be ready for Sunday’s game] but mentally we are ready. We now recover today and tomorrow (Friday and Saturday) and try to be the fittest we can for Tottenham.'
