Apple and Google have already realised the potential in connecting dashboards to phones, but if you can’t afford a new car fitted with this technology, Navdy offers a cheaper alternative.

Created in San Francisco, Navdy is a dashboard-mounted heads-up display (HUD) that connects to an Android or iOS smartphone via Bluetooth.

Notifications from Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, and more are automatically beamed to the display, and these notifications can be responded to, or dismissed, using voice and hand gestures.

Display: 5.1-inch (13cm) transparent Head-Up Display (HUD)

Imaging: High quality projector

Sensors: Infrared camera with wide-angle sensors for gesture control

Connectivity: WiFi and Bluetooth-enabled 

Processor: Dual core processor running Android 4.4 

Width: 5.1-inches (13cm)

Depth: 5.5-inches (14cm)

Height: 3.7-inches (95mm) including display

It will also show emails, text messages, calls and maps.

During navigation, in particular, the screen splits in two so the map is still visible, but the driver can see who is calling or messaging them.

The voice and hand gestures can also be used to compose Facebook posts or tweets while driving, and Navdy is fitted with noise cancelling technology, to drown out the noise of the engine, as well as wide-angle gesture sensors.

Navdy, created by entrepreneur Doug Simpson, can be positioned wherever is most comfortable for the driver, and the transparent screen doesn’t block the road ahead.

The device additionally comes with advanced dimming and stabilisation controls.

Elsewhere, Navdy can ll sync with built-in smart car technology, where available, to show alerts such as low tyre pressure and fuel levels.

Navdy works with iOS 7 and Android 4.3 and above.

It is available for pre-­order at an introductory price of $299 (£180) - a 40 per cent discount from its retail price of $499 (£295).

International shipping will add $30 (£17) to this price.

International shipping will add $30 (£17) to this price and the device is expected to launch 'early next year'

Navdy will also show emails, text messages, calls and maps. It also syncs with the calendar, Pandora and iTunes music. The compatible app icons are pictured

Navdy is similar to a HUD recently created by Garmin. 

Garmin's version sits on a car's dashboard and projects turn-by-turn directions on a transparent film attached to the windscreen.

The directions are sent to the HUD over Bluetooth from a smartphone running the Garmin StreetPilot or NAVIGON satellite navigation apps.

Spoken turn-by-turn directions can also be enabled and are played out either through the smartphone's speakers, or via Bluetooth through the car's stereo. 

If music is being streamed to the car stereo from the smartphone at the same time the HUD will automatically 
fade it out for the turn-by-turn voice prompts.
