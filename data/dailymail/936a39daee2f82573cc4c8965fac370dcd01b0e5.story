Neymar will be fit to play for Brazil in Friday's World Cup quarter-final against Colombia, despite suffering from thigh and knee injuries sustained against Chile.

Brazil's confederation said on Monday that team doctor Jose Luiz Runco checked on Neymar when the squad returned to its training camp and revealed the player is not a concern for the host's clash in Fortaleza. 

Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was worried following Saturday’s win over Chile, saying Neymar could take days to be fit and that doctors would have to do their 'best to put him on the pitch.'

Heavy knock: Neymar suffered thigh and knee injuries during Brazil's last 16 victory over Chile on Saturday

Neymar complained of a left thigh injury after Brazil’s penalty shoot-out win over Chile, while Runco also said the player was also being treated for a knock on his right knee. 

Confederation spokesman Rodrigo Paiva did say the player could miss a few training sessions depending on how the injuries progress. 

'The worst is the knee, it’s what’s hurting the most,' Paiva said. 'He may be rested from practice if needed. He will be evaluated again, but Runco said fans don’t have to worry because he’s not a concern for the match.'

The Barcelona frontman was subjected to heavy challenges during the match against Chile, and twice had to leave the pitch for treatment.

Neymar admitted he played with pain the rest of the match while manager Scolari said the attacker’s thigh was extremely swollen in the dressing room after the match.

The 22-year-old scored one of the penalties that gave Brazil a 3-2 win in the shootout following Saturday's 1-1 draw.

'We just hope Neymar can recover as fast as possible so he can be ready for our next match,' said midfielder Fernandinho.

Brazil doctors said three other players were undergoing treatment following the Chile game, although none of the injuries were serious. 

Midfielder Luiz Gustavo, who is suspended from the match against Colombia, was nursing a right knee injury, while playmaker Oscar had a deep scratch on his left thigh. Defender David Luiz was recovering from a back problem sustained before Brazil's last 16 victory over the Chileans.
