On trial: Andrew and Lesley Reeve outside Teesside Crown Court where they accused of stealing more than £100,000 from her godmother

A couple stole the life  savings of an elderly godmother to buy a new car and build a gym and wet room for their home, a court heard.

Lesley Reeve and her husband Andrew are said to have pilfered more than £100,000 from 91-year-old Joan Killen to fund their  lavish home improvements.

The pensioner, who is Mrs Reeve’s godmother, was left with no money to pay her own bills, Teesside Crown Court heard.

The pair, from Hartlepool, took over Mrs Killen’s finances when the spinster was taken into a care home in 2009 with dementia.

They are accused of milking her bank account dry and cashing in her benefits for themselves.

Prosecutor Matthew Bean told the court how Mrs Killen was left without pocket money while her goddaughter, 56, and Mr Reeve, 55, spent her savings within just two years.

More than £11,000 went on paying off Mrs Reeve’s credit card bill while the couple also bought a car, revamped their £220,000 detached home and added new furniture.

When they were arrested last year, they claimed the garage conversion on the four-bedroom property was being carried out so that the pensioner could move in with them when she recovered.

But a planning application submitted to the council detailed installing a gym and a wet room – and made no mention of a bedroom.

Opening the case, barrister  Mr Bean told the jury: ‘The prosecution say that this money was taken from her account in order for them to spend it on themselves.

'The prosecution say the money was used to pay for the conversion at their house . . . and also used by the defendants to buy a car, furnishings and electrical equipment.

‘We ask you to look at this woman’s mental health.

‘It shows she was vulnerable and suffering from a gradual deterioration in her capacity due to the onset of dementia.

‘The prosecution say both defendants must have been well aware of this and decided to take advantage of her vulnerability by taking and spending her life savings.’

The court heard that Mrs Killen had ‘substantial’ savings of more than £130,000 in January 2009, but within two years there was just over £3,000 left in her accounts.

Council officials launched an investigation after realising the care home resident was often left without pocket money and did not have enough to meet her bills.

Mr Reeve twice ignored letters to provide detailed bank statements, said Mr Bean, because he knew there was little left and the discovery of that could lead to police involvement.

Soon after, small amounts of money were transferred back into the pensioner’s accounts in a cynical attempt to hide the thefts, the prosecutor said.

'Taking advantage': There was regular spending by the couple at Next (left), Marks & Spencer (right, both file pictures) and Argos, funded by Miss Killen, the court was told

Case: The couple are accused at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) of stealing almost £95,000 from Joan Killen's savings after Mr Reeve became a co-signatory for her accounts when her mental health began to deteriorate

After their arrests, the couple denied acting dishonestly and claimed they had been given permission by the woman to spend the money.

Mr Bean said their victim had no close relatives visiting her and although her goddaughter was not a blood relative, she and her husband were in line to inherit almost all of her possessions anyway.

But he told the jury it was ‘no coincidence’ that transfers back into the godmother’s account began only after the Reeves were told of the council investigation.

The court also heard that within weeks of the woman being taken into temporary care, her home was stripped of a stairlift and warden alarms despite Mr Reeve being told she may return.

The house was then let by the couple who had the rent and payment for utility bills paid directly into their accounts along with the elderly woman’s pension and winter fuel allowance.

The Reeves deny four joint charges of theft. The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
