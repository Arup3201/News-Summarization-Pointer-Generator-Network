Allegation: Russell Woolwright first kissed the alleged victim and then 'caused or incited' her to carry out the lewd act in an alleyway, a court heard

A male teacher at a leading public school persuaded a ‘flirty’ girl pupil to perform a sex act on him after she initiated a secret meeting, a court heard.

Russell Woolwright, 30, was working at £30,000-a-year Canford School when he bumped into the teenager off the premises, it is alleged.

The chance encounter, in October last year, led to the girl and her friend sending him messages on his school email account urging him to meet her again in a nearby town, the jury was told.

It was said that during the liaison Woolwright, a former professional tennis player, kissed the alleged victim and then ‘caused or incited’ her to carry out the lewd act in an alleyway.

Police later learnt about the matter. The girl, who cannot be named and whose exact age has not been revealed, told officers what happened, the court heard. She said that she did not want Woolwright to get into trouble because she liked him and was attracted to him.

But the unmarried economics teacher has now gone on trial charged with two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a girl as an adult in a position of trust. He denies the charges.

The court heard Woolwright was seeing a fellow teacher at the time of the alleged incident.

David Bartlett, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘You might conclude the girls were leading the defendant on, that they were flirting with him.

‘That does not excuse the defendant’s behaviour towards her as he was an adult.’

Mr Bartlett said the girl initially insisted the pair had just kissed, but described the sex act in a second police interview a month later.

He told Bournemouth Crown Court: ‘She said she didn’t want to get the defendant into trouble as she liked him.

‘When she found out the defendant had denied even doing that [kissing] she decided to tell the whole truth.’  

Marcus Tregilgas-Davey, defending, said the girl had chosen to embellish her story to avoid being blamed for the alleged incident, which Woolwright (pictured) claims she initiated

Defending, Marcus Tregilgas-Davey said the girl had chosen to embellish her story to avoid being blamed for the alleged incident. He said: ‘I suggest you came up with this story to deflect criticism from you.’

The court heard that around two weeks after the alleged incident, the girl tried to contact Woolwright again via email. Asked why she did so, she replied: ‘We thought it would be funny when we were drunk.’

Mr Tregilgas-Davey said: ‘I suggest that if you had engaged in sexual activity with him and it was something you were embarrassed about, the last thing you would want to do is make contact with him again.’

Canford School is a mixed independent school with around 630 pupils at its 300-acre campus on the River Stour near Wimborne, Dorset.

Former pupils include Stephen Ward, the osteopath linked to the Profumo Affair, and film director Derek Jarman. Woolwright, from Bristol, no longer teaches at the school.

 The trial continues.
