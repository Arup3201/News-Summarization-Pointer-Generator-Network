Hundreds of infants and toddlers have reportedly been captured by border officers after crossing into the U.S. illegally from Mexico unaccompanied by an adult as a growing number of migrants from Central America overwhelm detention centers in Texas.

The U.S. Border Patrol detained 378 children aged two or less who were traveling without a parent or guardian from Oct 1 through June 11, according to data obtained by Fusion from the office of a high-ranking Democratic senator who wasn't identified. Of those, 95 were under a year old.

Parents may be sending their wee ones across the border in hopes they will be allowed to stay, fueled in part by misconceptions among migrants that people with children can enter the U.S. legally.

The federal government will spend more than $1 billion this year feeding, clothing and otherwise babysitting the children until suitable adult guardians can be found.

HHS claims 85 per cent of them are reunited with family members, but those are guardians in the United States, not in their home countries. The agency has not responded to requests for information about how many of them are themselves illegal aliens.

The growing number of immigrants trying to make it into the U.S. is being driven in part by a misconception that children won't be deported. That's a misinterpretation of a 2012 policy that delays the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children prior to 2007.

Still, unaccompanied children are more likely than adults to slip through the cracks and ultimately remain in the U.S. for months or even years.

Once captured, most minors are processed and reunited with family members or a guardian in the U.S. while they await deportation proceedings. Detention facilities are generally not equipped to handle young people, especially infants and toddlers. 

But because of the significant backlog and lack of resources put into tracking them, few are expected to ever return and face immigration judges.

Few of the children are expected to return to face immigration judges, according to the nation's largest border patrolman's union.

In 2012 President Obama announced a policy intended to delay the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2007.

But in a transnational game of 'telephone', that policy has been misinterpreted – in some cases willfully so, by 'coyotes' who make a living transporting immigrants into the U.S. – to suggest that it would apply equally to newly arriving minors.

Rumors also persist that the U.S. will pass immigration reform that will grant migrants already within its borders amnesty and a right to remain.

The steady stream of tens of thousands of
 unaccompanied children is part of a recent surge in Central Americans 
crossing into the U.S. via the 
Rio Grande Valley in Texas. About 174,000 people have been arrested by 
the Border Patrol there since Oct 1, including 52,000 children - a 99 per cent
 increase from last year. Most of the migrants hail from Honduras, El 
Salvador and Guatemala.

The average age of an unaccompanied child is 14, according to Emily Butera, a senior program officer at the Women's Refugee Commission. 

The Obama Administration is trying to address the problem by combating the misinformation and opening new detention facilities designed for families in an effort to 
process and deport them more quickly. The first one will be located on 
the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's Artesia, New Mexico, 
campus, according to The Wall Street Journal.

At the moment, the Border Patrol is releasing many of them while they 
await their deportation proceedings because there is no place to hold 
them, making it easier for them to blend into the population and remain for years.

The 
immigration agency currently has only one detention center designed for families, 
an 85-bed facility in Pennsylvania.

The rising number of migrants have overwhelmed U.S. authorities at the U.S.'s busiest corridor for crossings in South Texas, forcing them to seek out additional detention space. A plan to bus hundreds to an empty college campus in Lawrenceville, Virginia, was scrapped after a community backlash, according to CBS News.

The government is also trying to ease agents' workload by flying hundreds of migrants to California for processing, the AP reported. Two flights on Monday will ferry about 140 Central American migrants to San Diego and a nearby town, according to Paul Beeson, chief of the Border Patrol for the California city.

The flights are expected to continue every three days, primarily filled with families with young children, but no unaccompanied minors.

Neither plan, however, will help address the growing number of children making the perilous journy across the border alone. Vice President Joe Biden met with Central American leaders in Guatemala on Friday in hopes of discouraging minors from making the voyage and emphasizing that traveling with children does not give migrants a free pass.

'We
 are prioritizing the need to resolve these cases…in light of the 
humanitarian crisis caused by the number of crossings,' Mr Biden said. 'Make no mistake, once an individual's case is fully heard, and 
if he or she does not qualify for asylum, he or she will be removed from
 the United States and returned home. Everyone should know that.'
