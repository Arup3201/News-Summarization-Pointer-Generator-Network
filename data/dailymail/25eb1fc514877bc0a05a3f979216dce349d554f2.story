Ronny Deila has admitted he wants to reduce the size of his Celtic first-team squad.

Currently scouring the market for reinforcements in the January transfer window, the Parkhead boss also intends to remove some dead wood if suitable offers come in.

Beram Kayal and Derk Boerrigter have seen little game time this season, while Teemu Pukki and Amido Balde have been shipped out on loan.

Keen to minimise the numbers of brooding, unhappy players around the dressing room, Deila said: ‘We have a big squad and I want, from a long-term perspective, to have a smaller squad.

‘We have too many players and, in my mind, it’s much better to have 20-22 players of a good level and then fill it with youngsters, instead of having 28 or 29 players.

‘You can have experienced players about who are always disappointed. But it also costs a lot of money having big squads.

‘We have contracts with players but, if opportunities come, and it’s right for them and right for us, then things can happen.

‘I don’t have in my mind that something has to happen. But I think some of the players are looking and we are also thinking about things.’

Celtic fringe players Derk Boerrigter and Beram Kayal could leave Parkhead later this month

Israeli international Kayal’s contract is up in the summer and he is likely to leave this month to ensure Celtic receive a fee.

‘Right now, Beram is not playing and he has ambition,’ said Deila of the midfielder.

‘He has to get his fitness up and show performances. Then we’ll see what is happening. I have spoken with him and we both know the situation.’

Dutch misfit Boerrigter, a £1.5 million signing from Ajax, returns from yet another injury this week, but has failed to set the heather alight.

‘Derk has been out now for two or three months but I think he’s starting training again on Thursday,’ said Deila. 'He has a lot to prove to me. He has been out a long time.

‘When he played at the start of the season, he had a pain in his knee. Hopefully, now everything is good, we can see the best from him.

‘If he shows in training that he is good enough then we’ll see. But, again, we have to put out the team we feel is best. It’s for him to prove himself.’

Portuguese striker Balde is also surplus to requirements after leaving Belgian club Beveren to go on loan at Hapoel Tel Aviv in Israel. There is also little prospect of Pukki being brought back from Brondby in Denmark.

‘Something has to happen for them. Both are out on loan just now,’ added Deila. ‘If they perform very well, then we have to consider what is happening. But there’s a reason why they have been loaned out.’

Kris Commons won't be joining Celtic for the final couple of days in Gran Canaria

Kris Commons, meanwhile, has abandoned plans to fly to Celtic’s Gran Canaria training camp following a family bereavement. Talks on the midfielder’s contract are anticipated this week, but he will play no part in Friday afternoon’s final friendly of the trip against Sparta Prague.

‘Kris will not be coming because the funeral was yesterday,’ said Deila. ‘There are only two days left of our trip and I don’t think it’s best for him to come out.

‘He will train at Lennoxtown, then he will be ready to rejoin us on Thursday.

‘Against Sparta, it will be a young team featuring a lot of the players who didn’t play last time.’
