Jimmy Anderson was involved in another ugly on-field spat as England closed in on victory in the third Test against India thanks to part-time spinners Moeen Ali and Joe Root.

Anderson, who faces an ICC hearing on Friday for an altercation with Ravi Jadeja during the first Test, needed to be ushered away after an angry exchange with Ajinkya Rahane.

The Indian batsman appeared to react angrily to comments directed at him by the England bowler at the close of play.

Root said: ‘I’m sure it was nothing. Jimmy’s always had that aggression and I hope he continues it on Thursday. We’re hungry to win.’

Ali and Root took three priceless Indian wickets in the final session of the fourth day at Southampton to leave the tourists, chasing a world-record 445 to win, in trouble at 112 for four.

England need six wickets on Thursday to claim their first win in 11 Tests and level the series at 1-1.
