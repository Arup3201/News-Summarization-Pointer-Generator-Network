School board member Stefanie Dickinson, 37, allegedly sexted a boy of 14

A school board official has been arrested after 'sexting' one of her teenage son's friends.

Mother-of-two Stefanie Dickinson allegedly sent sexually explicit messages to the 14-year-old boy after he  joined her family on a weekend camping trip.

The 37-year-old is alleged to have offered to have sex with the teen telling him in one text 'Baby, I will rock your f****** world!'

Her arrest has stunned education 
chiefs and other parents at the school district where Dickenson serves 
as treasurer on the Board of Education in the Ellicott District in 
Colorado Spring, Colorado.

Police
said Dickinson asked for the teen's cell number so she could send him 
photographs from their weekend trip to Lake Meredith.

The boy had joined her two teenage sons for the trip.

The teen said a week later at the end of August  he started receiving text messages of a sexual nature.

An arrest warrant revealed that the mum of two sent the boy a message saying she wanted to sneak out of the house to meet him.

A deputy later found a text message on the boy’s phone from Dickinson that read 'I just want u,' the warrant said.

Another text message sent from Dickinson talked about having sex, followed by 'Baby I will rock ur effing world!! Haha.'

The sexting supposedly began after the boy joined Dickinson's family, including her two sons, on a camping trip to Lake Meredith, in Colorado

The text messages were discovered by the boy’s sister, who became suspicious about the relationship after she saw Dickinson talking to her brother and repeatedly hugging him .

The arrest report said Dickinson would hug the boy after football practice and was heard telling him:'I'll text you later.'

Another text revealed that Dickinson was concerned about the consequences of getting caught when she said to the teen 'You can't tell anyone about this at all because I could lose my family.'

The victim also told deputies that Dickinson 'would always tell me I have a sexy smile.'

School chiefs issued a statement to parents after Dickinson's arrest.

The statement said:'The District is aware of the allegation against Mrs. Dickinson and we have no direct information at this time and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment upon it.

'Mrs. Dickinson has been on the Board of Education for 2 yrs and is the Treasurer of the Board.'

Dickinson was booked into the El Paso County jail on suspicion of Internet luring of a child, a Class 4 felony.

She has posted a $3,000 bond, but has been placed on administrative leave from her job as the Memorial Hospital where she works in the radiology department.
