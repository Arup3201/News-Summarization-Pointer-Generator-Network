A California woman who murdered her husband 14 years ago by poisoning him with antifreeze in order to cash in on a life insurance policy she took out on him will be executed, the California Supreme Court ruled Thursday.

Angelina Rodriguez - who also is suspected of killing her 13-month-old daughter in 1993 - appealed the death sentence she was given after her conviction in the murder of her then-husband, Jose Francisco Rodriguez

Rodriguez and the victim - a special education teacher - were married several months before his 2000 death, which was brought on by Rodriguez's systematically serving him drinks laced with antifreeze and oleander.

Killer: Angelina Rodriguez will be executed for murdering her husband, an appeals court ruled Thursday

Shortly after the couple was married Rodriguez convinced her husband to take out joint life insurance polices, which authorities say was her motive for killing the man.

Rodriguez's attorneys appealed her death sentence, arguing that the jury in the sentencing phase of her trial never should have heard testimony that implicated her in her daughter's death nearly a decade earlier.

Rodriguez has never been charged with a crime in the death of her daughter, but after murdering her husband, law enforcement officials re-examined the death of the baby and determined that the girl likely was murdered.

The baby, Alicia, died after choking on a pacifier that had been recalled after consumers complained that it often broke into pieces that could get lodged in a child's throat.

Two months prior to the death of Alicia, Rodriguez took out a $50,000 life insurance policy on the baby - without telling the baby's father, her then-husband - naming herself as the beneficiary.

Rodriguez also sued the company that made the pacifier, landing a $710,000 settlement.

Death sentence: In addition to murdering her husband, a judge says she likely killed her daughter, too

In the Court's decision, Justice Ming W. Chin wrote that even though Rodriguezz had never faced charges in the death of her daughter, the jury in the sentencing phase of the trial should have been aware that 'there was ample evidence that defendant murdered her daughter,' according to the Los Angeles Times.

Chin also wrote that poisoning her husband was likely at least the second time Rodriguez attempted to murder him - Chin says she made a previous attempt by loosening natural gas valves in the couple's garage several weeks before poisoning him.

In addition to murdering her husband and likely murdering her daughter, while in jail awaiting trial Rodriguez tried to dissuade a witness from testifying against her by potentially having the witness killed. For that crime, the jury convicted her of interfering with the witness but failed to reach a verdict on whether she tried to have the witness murdered.Â 

Rodriguez's attorney for her appeal, Karen Kelly, told the paper she is going to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the lower court's decision.
