This is the shocking moment a traffic warden was karate-kicked in the head by a shaven-headed thug as he prepared to issue a parking ticket.

Shocking CCTV footage shows how the officer was attacked after being approached by three men as he took down a car registration number.

The kick was so forceful that the warden fell to the ground and had to be treated in hospital.

Attack: A traffic warden is karate-kicked in the head by a shaven-headed thug as he prepares to hand out a ticket in Leicester

The footage shows the three men approaching the warden as he notes the details of a car parked on a pavement over double yellow lines in Leicester.

One of the men spits into the officer's notebook as he walks past.

The warden is also poked in the face with a pen.

Seconds later, one of the men steps away from the officer and launches into a sickening kick at his head, knocking him to the pavement and sending his hat flying.

The three men then flee the scene, running towards a nearby supermarket while passers-by rush to help the stricken warden.

The injured man, in his early thirties, was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary and treated for severe bruising to his face and head.

Trouble ahead: The traffic warden, wearing a hat and high-visibilty jacket, is approached by three men

Disgusting: One of the men, wearing a dark t-shirt, spits in the officer's notebook

Threatening: One of the men takes out a pen and pokes it in the warden's face as the others look on

The incident happened outside a florist's shop at midday on Saturday, September 1.

Businessman Bob Young, whose CCTV cameras filmed the attack, said: 'The thing that shocks me is the guy was doing his job.

'They are not drivers, they are people just walking down the street and they’ve set about a person doing his public duty, and that is just not acceptable.

'It was horrendous. It was just a random attack, there was no reason for it at all.

'The poor warden has just come out of hospital and is going back to work.

'I’m very pleased that we’ve actually got it on CCTV and hopefully the people will be brought to justice.'

The three suspects were white, aged in their late twenties to early thirties, and were said to be of Eastern European appearance.

Poised: The man then steps away from the warden as he prepares to launch himself into a karate kick

Taking aim: The thug brings his foot back, ready to strike his unsuspecting victim

Blow: The thug's foot connects, knocking the traffic warden's head back

Ferocious: The force of the kick sends the traffic warden's hat flying and causes him to fall to the ground

Disgraceful: The men pay their victim a dismissive glance before fleeing the scene

Pc Leigh Spencer, of Leicestershire Police, said: 'We were called to the scene by the ambulance service after the man was found with nasty injuries to his face and head.

'Through CCTV enquiries in the area we have managed to capture the assault and images of the people responsible.

'I would urge anyone with information about those men, and the men themselves, to come forward.'

Leicester City Council’s head of traffic management, Andrew Thomas, said: 'It’s the first time something like this has happened.

'It’s obviously an unpopular job but the attacks like this against staff who are simply carrying out their work is totally unacceptable.

'He’s been discharged from hospital and has been resting at home.

'I’d like to thank the community for coming to help him and Mr Young for making the footage available.

'We’d urge anyone with information about this incident to report it to the police.'
