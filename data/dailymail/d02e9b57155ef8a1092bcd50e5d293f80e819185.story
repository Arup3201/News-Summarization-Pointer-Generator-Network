The hearing hear that Dr Gyorgy Rakoczy had trouble speaking English

A foreign surgeon who mistakenly injected a four-year-old boy with a massive overdose of a toxic chemical has been suspended.

Hungarian Dr Gyorgy Rakoczy had trouble speaking English and communicating with other staff, a General Medical Council (GMC) hearing heard.

The boy was left with a hole in his spine and needed 30 operations. He now needs to be fitted with a colostomy bag.

He was found guilty of serious misconduct after the incident at Manchester Children’s Hospital, which left the child fighting for life.

The boy was treated at the hospital in 2009 for a small haemorrhoid, which Dr Rakoczy removed.

He then injected the child with a carbolic acid 16 times the correct dose and four times a potentially lethal dose.

The highly-corrosive liquid burned away parts of the boy’s body leaving him with a hole down to the bone at the base of his spine.

He was rushed to intensive care and doctors warned his parents he was unlikely to survive.

He did pull through, but was left severely injured and has since undergone over 30 operations.

The Hungarian  was suspended from his job for three months. His ability to practise medicine was judged to be impaired by the GMC

The parents of the boy welcomed the decision and revealed that they fought to haul Dr Rakoczy before a disciplinary panel after he had continued to work following the incident.

The boy’s mother, who wished to remain anonymous, revealed the toll Dr Rakoczy's actions had had on their family: 'It is hard to begin to describe how this has affected our son,' she said.

'In a picture two days before it happened, he’s got a big smile on his face. A week later, after the operation, and he’s become gaunt and sad.

'It was so sad seeing him start school with a colostomy bag.

The mother and father of the boy, who have asked not to be identified. The mother said: 'It is hard to begin to describe how this has affected our son.'

'His injuries still mean even doing ordinary things like going to the park or a birthday party are very difficult.'

'I just hope that what has happened at the GMC makes Dr Rakoczy realise just how serious his errors were.'

The hearing was told Dr Rakoczy currently had a high workload.

But the panel ruled aspects of his work were of ‘a very poor standard’ and a suspension was essential to ensure that the public did not lose confidence in doctors.

Panel chairman Professor Michael Whitehouse told him: 'Your careless approach to a number of basic aspects of clinical practice and catastrophic mistake are in breach of your professional duty.

'Your actions in administering a potentially fatal bottle of phenol and your admission of reading each line of text on the bottle is most serious in nature.

'Public confidence in your profession would be damaged if your fitness to practise was not judged impaired.'

The boy was injected at Manchester Children's Hospital

The family are now taking legal action against Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital.

Their solicitor, Jenny Unwin, of law firm Pannone, said: 'No amount of money is going to properly compensate but it will help his parents provide for his future needs and any future treatment he needs.'

A spokesman for the trust said: 'We wish to offer our sincere apologies to the boy and his family for the obvious distress this incident has caused.'
