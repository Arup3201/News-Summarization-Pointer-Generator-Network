Wolves and mountain lions could soon be a more common sight in densely populated cities in the United States, experts fear.

Colonies of coyotes have already established themselves in the suburbs of Chicago.

Scientists believe other potentially 
dangerous wild animals, including wolves, lions and bears, may soon be 
following in their footsteps as they adapt to urban living.

Yesterday a mountain lion stretching over 6-feet in size was shot dead by police officers in a residential area of Des Moines, Iowa while roaming just blocks from an elementary school and in a man's backyard.

Mountain lions have been sighted on the fringes of American cities, with one shot near the Wrigleyville neighbourhood of Chicago.

'The coyote is the test case for other animals,' said Dr Stan Gehrt, from Ohio State University, who has been tracking the wild dogs.

'Racoons, skunks, foxes - they’ve already been able to penetrate the urban landscape pretty well. The coyote is the most recent and largest. The jury’s out with what’s going to happen with the bigger ones. They are going to be an even bigger challenge.'

For at least six years, one small 
coyote community five miles from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport 
has remained within a territory covering just a third of a square mile.

'That’s
an indication that they don’t have to go far to find food and water,' 
said Dr Gehrt. 'They’re finding everything they need right there, in the
suburbs of Chicago. It amazes me.'

He estimates that about 2,000 coyotes live in the city’s metro area, along with nine million people in 250 municipalities.

People living in urban areas are going to have to get used to predators on their doorstep, says Dr Gehrt.

He added: 'It used to be rural areas 
where we would have this challenge of coexistence versus conflict with 
carnivores. In the future, and I would say currently, it’s cities where 
we’re going to have this intersection between people and carnivores.

'We
used to think only little carnivores could live in cities, and even 
then we thought they couldn’t really achieve large numbers. But we’re 
finding that these animals are much more flexible than we gave them 
credit for and they’re adjusting to our cities.

'That’s going to put the burden back 
on us. Are we going to be able to adjust to them living with us or are 
we not going to be able to coexist?'

Earlier this year police shot dead a mountain lion after it wandered into the downtown area of a busy city.

The large cat was found by a janitor in the courtyard of an office building near a popular open-air mall, the Third Street Promenade, in Santa Monica, California near a preschool, church and other businesses.

Authorities made multiple attempts to try and subdue the young male cat, including use of a tranquilizer and a pepper ball, according to Capt Daniel Sforza of the Fish and Game Department.

'Risk': Police tried to use a tranquilizer and pepper ball to slow the cat instead of killing him before the animal was shot and carried off by authorities into a truck

Dr Gehrt issued his warning at the EcoSummit 2012 meeting taking place in Columbus, Ohio.

He pointed out that historically, one reason people moved out of remote areas was to get away from dangerous large predators.

'The funny thing is that now we have more people on earth and bigger cities than ever, we also now have carnivores moving into cities,' said Dr Gehrt.

'It’s a two-way street. We’re expanding cities into their territories and they’re also coming in.'

Coyotes can be helpful by hunting rodents and rabbits, but will also eat the occasional cat or small dog, he said.

The animals do not usually attack humans. Waving arms, shouting, or throwing a rock will usually scare a threatening coyote away, said Dr Gehrt.
