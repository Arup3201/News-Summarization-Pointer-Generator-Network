The wife of Kyle Van Winkle, the Missouri man who was found dead outside the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium has said that since his death at the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium she has been living a nightmare - while his police officer father denied his son was drunk.

Jenni Van Winkle, the mother of their seven-week-old son Will said that every day has become a living nightmare as she waits for investigators to establish exactly what killed her husband who was found unconscious on December 1 and whose death has been ruled a homicide.

'It's completely senseless. I can't even wrap my mind around it sometimes,' Van Winkle's wife, Jenni, told ABC News. 'I wake up every single day with the same nightmare.'

'I try to move forward and I get up and I take care of Will because I know that's just what Kyle would want and unfortunately my life, now, is a reality that I never thought that I would have to be in'.

Indeed, according to his father, police sergeant Dean Van Winkle, his son was not intoxicated when he left his seat during the NFL game to go to the restroom.

Van Winkle, 30, died after a fight with the man who owned the green jeep he broke into in the parking lot of the stadium during the Chiefs game.

'I was with him from start to finish that day at the tailgating. Most everybody in our group had some kind of drinks,' Van Winkle said.

'If I had thought he was intoxicated or in trouble I would have followed him.'

The owner of the jeep found Van Winkle inside his car and a struggle ensued - during which Van Winkle collapsed and died.

The police were called to the parking lot of Arrowhead Stadium at around 5.20 pm and Van Winkle was rushed to hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

Four people were taken into custody for questioning following the incident, but no one was charged.

'There's just too much unknown there, so it makes it difficult for everybody but it's also something I recognize as some of this may never be figured. I certainly don't have the answers,' Dean Van Winkle said.

The medical examiner's office has ruled Kyle Van Winkle's death a homicide - meaning he was killed by another person - though it has not made a decision on the cause of death.

The Kansas City Star reports that police are focusing their investigation on a 24-year-old tailgater as Van Winkle's primary attacker.

Detectives searched the man's home and arrested him - though he has not been formally charged and his name has not been released.

Van Winkle, the 30-year-old son of a Missouri police sergeant and a new father, died in the parking lot of Arrowhead Stadium Sunday after he left the Chiefs-Denver Brocos game.

His family says he got into an unlocked dark-colored Jeep in the parking lot that looked nearly identical to one of the vehicles his friend drove to the game. It was in the same row as his friend's vehicle - but 10 cars away.

When the owner of the Jeep arrived at his car with his 10-year-old son and found Van Winkle inside, he called for help - believing he had broken into the vehicle, according to police.

The Star reports that tailgaters who were watching the game on TV from the parking lot ran over and began beating Van Winkle.

One witness tried to stop the assault, but the tailgaters pushed him away.

One tailgater in particular, the 24-year-old who is now a suspect, showered Van Winkle with blows until he was unconscious, according to police.

Someone propped him up, unconscious against a bus.

The 24-year-old assailant and his friends went back to their tailgate party. The Jeep owner and his son left.

An unknown amount of time later, a bystander noticed that Van Winkle was turning blue.

Witnesses called paramedics - but it was too late. He died at the hospital.
