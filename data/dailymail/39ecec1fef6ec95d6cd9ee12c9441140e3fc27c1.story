 A $5,000 cross was stolen from a church in the Bronx on Wednesday

One very brazen criminal, or group of criminals, did the unthinkable when they robbed one New York City church of a religious artifact.  

Police say that a $5,000 cross was reported missing Wednesday night from the lobby of Saint Anthony of Padua in the Bronx's Morrisania neighborhood.

What's more, the crucifix appears to have been stolen during an actual mass. 

'I’m distressed. That crucifix means so much to the people here … I’ve never seen anything like this,' Pastor Josu Iriondo told the New York Post.

As for who might be responsible, he said, 'It’s someone who knew what they were doing. They had to be professionals.'

Pastor Iriondo also believes whoever took the crucifix was likely their before, having planned out the heist ahead of time. 

Now he, and his congregation, are praying for the crucifix's safe return.

'That cross means so much to people even passing by. We could save one or two persons by just looking at it,' Pastor Iriondo said. 

Making this case even more odd is the name of the church.

Saint Anthony is the patron saint of stolen goods.

Police are asking anyone with information about the missing crucifix to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.
