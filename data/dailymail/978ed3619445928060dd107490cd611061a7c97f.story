A 17-year-old cheerleader who had just graduated from high school in New Jersey was shot in the head and killed on Sunday.

Cheyanne Bond had been walking down a street in Newark at about 9.45pm when she and her male friend, also 17, were attacked.

The teenager, who had planned to study nursing at college, was ordered to get on her knees before being shot 'execution style' a relative said.

Loss: Cheyanne Bond, 17, was forced to her knees and shot in the head on Sunday

Ambitious: Cheyanne, pictured right at her high school graduation, had been planning to study nursing at college

Police have released security camera footage of two young men seen near the crime scene, who they believe may have witnessed the shooting.

A reward of $12,500 is also being offered for help in catching the killer, as Newark mayor Ras Baraka raised concerns over rising gun violence in the city.

Cheyanne was the third homicide to be reported in Newark in less than 24 hours at the weekend.

Her uncle, Michael Bond, told CBS New York that his young niece never had a chance.

'They told her to get on her knees and they shot her in the head execution style,' Bond said. 'Just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.'

The teenager, who was described by school friends as quiet and hard working, had graduated from Malcolm X Shabazz High School a week before she was shot.

Crime scene: The shooting took place along this sidewalk on Sunday evening

She had proudly posted pictures of her high school graduation on Twitter, saying: 'We made it ... so proud of myself,'

She had also tweeted about her excitement at being accepted for college, which she had been due to start in the fall.

Her friend is recovering from gunshot wounds in hospital. Police have not released his identity because he is a witness.

The shooting took place next to a park, and opposite a row of houses that included one with security cameras.

Surveillance footage taken just moments after the shooting has been released by police. It shows to men walking along the same street.

One is in a white short-sleeved shirt that has a long-sleeved shirt underneath, and is wearing brown shorts and a hood. The second man was wearing blue jeans, a white T-shirt and a cap.

Tragic: Cheyanne, who had been living with a guardian since her mother's death 10 years ago, had been excited about starting college

Loved: The teenager's guardian described Cheyanne, pictured on her way to prom, as 'an angel and a blessing'

Friends of Cheyanne, who knew her as Shay, gathered at the site of the shooting earlier this week to leave candles and messages of support.

Her father Walter Ramey declined to be interviewed by TV crews, and said only that he wanted his daughter’s killer caught.

The money the family had put aside to pay for her college fund is now being used for funeral expenses.

Cheyanne had been living with a guardian in Irvington, but was also registered at her father's address while she was attending high school.

She moved in with her guardian and aunt, Samera Newsome, after the death of her mother about ten years ago. Newsome said Cheyanne had left the house at about 6pm on Sunday, and hadn't planned to be out late.

She described the girl she had looked after for so long as 'an angel and definitely a blessing', telling NJ.com Cheyanne was 'just a normal teenager living her life'.

Tribute: Candles, balloons and messages were left along the sidewalk where Cheyanne was killed

Concerns: Tributes left for Cheyanne. Community groups called for an end to violence at a vigil for the murdered schoolgirl

Her school's principal, Gemar Mills, described Cheyanne as a 'Good kid. Quiet kid. Fun kid' who was part of the school's cheer leading team.

'She had her friends, she loved to laugh, she loved to be at school,' he said, adding: 'She was quiet. She wasn’t a real loud, rowdy type of girl.'

During the vigil for the teenager, the Rev Thomas Ellis, of anti-crime group Enough is Enough, called for an end to violence.

'When you lose a young person to gun violence, you have to come together. The violence stops when we stop it,' he said, according to NJ.com.

Police have not released a motive for the killing yet, but said they had not ruled out robbery.
