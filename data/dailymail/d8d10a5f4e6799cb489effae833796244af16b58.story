Actor Mark Rylance pictured as Thomas Cromwell in the BBC version of Wolf Hall

Viewers appear to have been less than impressed, but for the BBC's director general, Tudor epic Wolf Hall is the BBC 'at its very best'.

Tony Hall, 63, gave his bold verdict as the drama's six-episode run came to an end and he added the adaptation of Hilary Mantel's bestselling book was a 'fantastic example' of 'doing things that people say "Only the BBC could do that".'

When Wolf Hall debuted last month, it attracted 3.9million viewers, the most successful opening for a BBC2 drama in a decade.

But, when the final episode hit screens on Monday, only 2.3million tuned in, meaning a third of the original audience had given up.

Apart from a slight bump in the middle of the series, the show, which follows the rise of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII, has seen a steady decline in viewers.

Those who did sit through the final instalment – which closed with the execution of Henry's second wife Anne Boleyn – joked they could predict the ending, given that it is one of the most famous moments in British history.

Lord Hall has always taken a keen interest in the multi-million pound project, visiting the set during production. Despite the disappointing public reaction, has stayed staunchly behind the programme.

Speaking at a special screening of the final episode earlier this week, he said: 'The BBC is about one thing and one thing only, it's about the programmes and the services that give those programmes to the British public.

'That's the case for the BBC, it's as long and short as that. In Wolf Hall we have had a fantastic example of the BBC at its very best, doing things that people say, "Only the BBC could do that".'

The director Peter Kosminsky, 58, also lavished praise on his creation but admitted that the £7million budget that has been reported was actually 'a great deal more.'

The final episode saw Thomas Cromwell's schemes and manoeuvrings to remove Anne Boleyn as queen come to fruition, with her beheading freeing Henry VIII to marry again.

Even though the execution is one of the most famous moments of the Tudor period, the lack of suspense did not ruin the drama for many fans.

One wrote on Twitter: 'Wolf Hall, carried by Mark Rylance's excellent per-formance was very very good. Even though everyone knew the ending it was still brutal.'

Despite earning the praise of BBC director general Tony Hall, the show lost 1.6million viewers during its five-week run. Pictured are Claire Foy and Damian Lewis as Anne Boleyn and King Henry VIII respectively

Another joked: 'Managed to avoid any spoilers for Wolf Hall for almost 500 years. Just need [to] see final episode without anyone ruining the ending.'

Wolf Hall has been dogged by complaints throughout its run, with the concerns of viewers ranging from it being too dark, too boring and difficult to follow.

Relying only on candles to illuminate some scenes, members of the audience complained at not being able to see what was happening on screen. Others found themselves unable to stick with the complex intrigues of the Tudor court.

One tweeted: 'I got super bored of Wolf Hall after half an hour and turned it off, and now I'm re-arranging my sock drawer' and another added: 'Thinking about Wolf Hall; know my history, loved the books but still found the chopping and changing of the time line slightly confusing.'
