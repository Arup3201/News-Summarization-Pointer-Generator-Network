The mother of the son who vanished after being left in an unlocked car while she went to get gas had previously been cited for leaving a child unattended in a vehicle, according to police.

Authorities in Washington state spent a second day today searching for two-year-old Sky Metawala, as court documents emerged revealing his parents had 
previously been arrested for leaving their child.

Mother Julia Biryukova had also obtained a restraining order against his father last year.

She told investigators she left the two-year-old alone on Sunday as she and her four-year-old daughter walked a
mile to a gas station, Bellevue police said.

When she came back an hour
later, the boy was gone, she said.

Investigators searched a 20-block area and even went door to door but found no sign of him.

In December 2009, officers in nearby Redmond cited Biryukova and her 
husband, Solomon Metalwala, for reckless endangerment for leaving a 
child unattended in a vehicle.

Details were not immediately available; 
police said they were working to redact an incident report for release 
under the state's public records act.

The case was dismissed early this year after the pair agreed to a year 
of probation, 40 hours of community service and a ten-week parenting 
class, said Ian Goodhew, a spokesman for the King County Prosecutor's 
Office.

The couple had been together for 14 years, married since 2003 and 
separated in March 2010, court records show.

In June 2010, Biryukova, 
30, filed for a protection order on behalf of herself and their two 
children, saying Solomon had a severe anger problem, was verbally 
abusive and that he had beat her for the first time the previous 
Christmas.

The reason was that she had allowed Sky – just four months old 
at the time – to sleep later than expected, she said.

'He became furious like I have never seen him before, he grabbed me by 
my hair in front of our daughter, dragged me into our 
hallway, threw me down on the floor and then threw me against a 
decorative column we have in the entrance of our home,' Biryukova wrote.

'He continued to assault me with his feet – by kicking me and then he 
took out his car keys and contrived to scratch me in any area he could.

The abuse escalated after that, with Solomon telling her to go live on the street and work as a prostitute, she said.

'The most, most recent have been his threats to kill me if I say 
anything against him or if in any way I proceed with action of seeking 
custody of our two small children,' Biryukova added. 'I live in constant
fear for my life and my children's life. Please investigate and help 
me!'

A man who answered the phone at King Street Kafe and Market, a shop 
Metalwala owns in Seattle's Pioneer Square neighborhood, referred calls 
to a Leslie Clay Terry III, a lawyer who represented the couple in the 
reckless endangerment case. Terry did not immediately return a call 
seeking comment.

Spokesperson for the Bellevue Police Department, Officer Carla Lafrate, told The Seattle Times: ‘King County felt like they had done a very thorough search of a pretty wide area for the boy and were confident that he wasn’t there.’

The mother told police that as she was walking back to her silver Acura from Chevron gas station a friend picked her up and drove them back to the car.

But when they returned, Sky was missing. The door had been left unlocked and there was no sign of forced entry, police said.

Officer Lafrate added: ‘We don’t know much, other than the child is still missing. I don’t know if the child got out on his own.’

Sky has been described as having brown eyes and dark buzz-cut hair.

He was dressed in a dark-green hooded sweatshirt and blue and grey striped trousers.

The case is being treated as a missing child, as they do not know if he was taken or left on his own accord.
