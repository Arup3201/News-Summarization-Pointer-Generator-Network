A pregnant woman died in Texas on Thursday after being thrown from her car during an accident with her boyfriend.

Houston police says the Monica Ramirez, who was naked, had apparently been fighting with boyfriend Anton Aleksandrov about 2 a.m. on New Year's Day, KHOU reported.

They got into separate vehicles and were heading south on the Sam Houston Parkway when the cars struck each other.

Both drivers lost control and slammed into a garage.

A pregnant woman was killed after a crash involving her boyfriend, who was driving on a separate car, and being thrown from her Dodge Ram (pictured) into a car garage. The baby miraculously survived

Ramirez, not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from her Dodge Ram and suffered a traumatic brain injury, KPRC reported.

She was rushed via ambulance to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where doctors still managed to deliver her baby before she died.

Houston police say she had been 25 weeks pregnant and the baby remains in intensive neonatal care.

Aleksandrovich was listed in stable condition and was cooperating with police.

Cops say alcohol may have been a factor but would not elaborate.

Court records show Ramirez had pulled a protective order against Aleksandrov in August, KHOU reported. She said he had kicked, stomped and dragged her.

No charges have been filed yet.
