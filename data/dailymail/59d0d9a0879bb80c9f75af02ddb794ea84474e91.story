Internet pioneer Sir Tim Berners-Lee has said his 
invention of the world wide web should be safeguarded - and has accused 
Western nations of hypocrisy over web spying.

The computer scientist's words of 
warning came as he and five other colleagues were recognised by the Queen for 
their pioneering working in helping to create the internet and the web.

The British inventor said his creation of the internet should be protected from being 
controlled by governments or large corporations.

'Insidious': British inventor Tim Berners-Lee has criticised Western governments for web spying

Asked to comment on the claims made by 
fugitive American whistle-blower Edward Snowden that his invention is 
being used by governments to access communications between individuals, 
Sir Tim said:

'The original design of the web of 24 years ago was for a 
universal space, we didn't have a particular computer in mind or 
browser, or language.

'When you make something universal...it can be used for good things or 
nasty things...we just have to make sure it's not undercut by any large 
companies or governments trying to use it and get total control.'

It has been claimed Snowden exposed alleged mass 
surveillance activities of the US and British governments. They are accused of using classified intelligence programmes, PRISM and Tempora, to spy on citizens.

Controversy: Sir Tim's comments come in the wake of revelations that British intelligence agency GCHQ has allegedly been spying on web and phone usage

Snowden – a former CIA employee - has fled to Hong Kong after claiming that the US National Security Agency has had access 
to data held by nine of the world’s top internet companies, including 
Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Skype.

He is now believed to have escaped to Moscow after being charged with treason by the US authorities.

Sir Tim went on to criticise 
security services in the US and Britain for employing data surveillance 
tactics and questioned whether they are capable of keeping such 
sensitive information safe.

'In the Middle East, people have been
 given access to the internet but they have been snooped on and then 
they have been jailed,' he told The Times newspaper.

'Obviously, it can be easy for people
 in the West to say "Oh those nasty governments should not be allowed 
access to spy". But it's clear that developed nations are seriously 
spying on the internet.'

He added that such practices 
would put people off using the internet in the future. He said many use 
the internet in 'intimate' ways and that they would not continue to do 
so if 'people feel that there's somebody looking over their shoulder.'

Row: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, left, has claimed that British and US intelligence agencies circumvent the law to spy on citizens but William Hague, right, said the allegations are 'baseless'

William Hague has defended the collaboration 
between Britain’s GCHQ agency and the National Security Agency in 
America as a ‘cornerstone’ of national security that had protected 
London.

He said intelligence obtained from the secret US eavesdropping operation helped prevent terror attacks at the 2012 Olympics.

The
 Foreign Secretary dismissed as ‘baseless’ claims that British spy 
chiefs have used the American espionage programme Prism to circumvent UK
 law and snoop on emails and phone calls.

Sir Tim
 has previously voiced oppistion to the Government's proposed Draft 
Communications Bill, dubbed by opponents as a 'snooper's charter'.

He
 described the legislation as 'draconian' and said it would diminish 
Britain's reputation as one of the countries which makes best use of the
 internet.

The inventor's work in establishing first 
the internet, a network of interconnected computer systems, then 
interlinked web pages accessed via the internet has revolutionised 
communication.

He originally developed the web to 
meet the demand for information-sharing between physicists in 
universities and institutes around the world.

Sir Tim, Robert Kahn, Vint Cerf and 
Louis Pouzin were jointly awarded the inaugural £1 million Queen 
Elizabeth Prize for Engineering during a glittering Buckingham Palace 
reception attended by the leaders of the three main parties - David 
Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband.

The Queen described how their 
achievements had 'completely changed' aspects of modern life and hailed 
engineering as the 'noble profession'.
