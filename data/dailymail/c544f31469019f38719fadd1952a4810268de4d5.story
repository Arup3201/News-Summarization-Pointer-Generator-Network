At 35 years old, male model Robert Paulat is practically ancient in the youth-obsessed world of fashion.

Yet the Czech hunk, who lives in Prague, is still securing plenty of modelling jobs thanks to 43 beauty procedures which he says keeps him looking young and photogenic.  

Currently signed with the prestigious Vanity Fair model agency in Europe, the  muscular clothes horse says that despite his ongoing success he is not afraid to admit that it was the result of a lot of investment.

Robert Paulat says that he had his 43 cosmetic procedures to thank for his continuing modelling career. Pictured: Robert before his operations (left) and Robert now (right) 

He said: 'I am obsessed with idea of raising people's self-confidence through improving one's appearance. 

'I think that proves I am not narcissistic because there is always something I'm not happy with.' 

Surprisingly Robert is the first person to admit that he is not perfect despite having pooled so much money into his looks. 

'I always find something to criticise about my looks.

'I think the proof of that is the fact that I have had over 40 surgical procedures in the search for perfection.'  

Despite having so much work done Robert says he is still not entirely happy with the way he looks 

The Czech model says that he often get's compared to a Ken doll which oddly people find appealing 

As well as the surgical procedures, including Botox and plasma treatments, there were also operations to change his nose and mouth.

Robert says that it is his bizarre likeness to a plastic doll that often secures him work.

'I am told by my clients that a lot of people see similarities between me and Barbie's partner Ken, which seems to be appealing.' 

Robert's modelling career started when he was 18 and he found almost immediately that he was popular with clients, but came to realise that the assignments may not go on forever.

That is why he is also now investing in other business possibilities, including owning and running an airport cafe among other things.

At 35, which is considered reasonably old for a model, Robert says he is aware that his career could come to an end soon and has began to plan an alternative future running an airport cafe
