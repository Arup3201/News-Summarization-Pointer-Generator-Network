A violent fist-fight between two teenage girls as parents and other children watched on has become a sickening social media sensation.

Footage of the brawl in a Queensland car park shows the two girls facing off against each other as a crowd encourages them to throw punches.

The four-minute fist fight, which was filmed in the Brothers Leagues Club car park in Townsville after an annual rugby league carnival, has been condemned by police.

Fist fight: Police have condemed this video of teenage girls fighting in a Townsville car park

Egged on: The combatants were cheered on by a large crowd of adults and children 

Security guards from leagues club eventually broke up the fight, which took place after the All Blacks Carnival in October last year.

The footage is currently circulating on YouTube and social media sites and has prompted police to issue a warning that similar incident would not be tolerated at this year's event.

Roger Whyte from Townsville Police said he was disgusted by the footage.

'The conduct displayed on this occasion by the combatants and all those watching, particularly those inciting, is poor form,' he told the Townsville Bulletin.

'No reasonable person can ever condone or support this type of behaviour, especially when it happens within a public place.

'It has far-reaching consequences for our community.'

Both girls wore a number of severe blows from each other's flying fists during the encounter, though there was a lengthy delay as one of the combatants was allowed to readjust her hair before they re-engaged.

The crowd egged them on yelling out 'give it to her' and 'let 'em fight'.

Brothers Leagues Club's general manager, Angela Burling, said the club 'doesn’t condone or tolerate any kind of violence'. 

Townsville's acting Mayor Vern Veitch directed his dismay at the onlookers saying the content of the comments from them was 'totally inappropriate'.
