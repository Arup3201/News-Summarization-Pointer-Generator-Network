More than $100,000 of taxpayers' money has been spent on flying empty VIP aircraft to pick up senior ministers from across Australia and then flying them back to Canberra in time for Parliament.

Passengers on the return trip include Defence Minister David Johnston and his wife, Toni Hodge, along with Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, according to The Sunday Telegraph.

Each one-way trip to Perth done by the empty 30-seat RAAF jet costs up to $16,000, but does not include the lavish return trip where ministers and their wives wine and dine on cocktails, boutique beers and restaurant-quality meals.

On top of that is the cost of rostering on RAAF crew members during the duration of the flights.

The Department of Defence calculates the bill for the 'special purpose aircraft' rides amount to six-figure sums, with a round-trip to the nation's capital costing an average of about $25,000, The Sunday Telegraph reported.

According to the Department of Finance's Guidelines for the Use of Special Purpose Aircraft, the defence minister has the authority to approve his own flights and those of party members.

Mr Johnston can use the aircraft for 'approving authorities and entitled persons to meet commitments associated with their official, parliamentary or political responsibilities, including electorate business'.

The list of passengers since the Abbott Government came into power, according to the Schedule of Special Purpose Aircraft from June 30 to December 31, mostly included the Governor-General and Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

The most expensive trip documented on the schedule by Mr Abbott was $33,660 travelling from Colombo to Canberra with 15 other passengers on November 17, which came after a $24,420-trip from Darwin to Colombo just three days before.
