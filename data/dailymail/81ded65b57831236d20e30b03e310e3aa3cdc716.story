After 58 years of marriage, they decided they could not bear to face life apart.

And so as they both battled increasingly debilitating illnesses, retired GP David Arnold and his wife Elizabeth made a pact to die side by side.

For this final act, having failed one previous suicide attempt, they enlisted the help of the person closest to them – their loving daughter Georgina Roberts.

Retired doctor David Arnold (right) and his wife Elizabeth (left) decided to end their lives when he became a bed-bound amputee and she was diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer's

The 59-year-old yesterday told an inquest how on the eve of her father’s 82nd birthday, her parents decided ‘today was the day’.

She
 was instructed by her father, a member of the right-to-die campaign 
group Dignity in Dying, to prepare a toxic drug, which he and his wife 
drank before slipping quickly into unconsciousness.

She
 then watched in ‘stunned silence’ as her parents passed away, the 
inquest heard.

Giving evidence, Mrs Roberts said she was ‘motivated 
entirely by compassion and love.’

‘I’m a human being who loved my 
parents very deeply and wanted to help them when they couldn’t help 
themselves,’ she said.

The Crown Prosecution Service decided it was not in the public interest to charge Mrs Roberts with any offence.

Daughter Georgina Roberts admitted buying and preparing the drugs for her parents

The
 devoted couple, from Newbury, Berkshire, had decided to end their lives
 when Dr Arnold became a bed-ridden amputee and after 85-year-old Mrs 
Arnold was diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, the inquest 
heard.

They had discussed 
this openly with family and friends for a number of years, and had even 
revealed their plan to doctors and psychiatrists, it heard.

All of their children, Georgina, Stephen and Simon were aware of their father’s wishes and supported him, the hearing was told.

The
 couple had approached the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end their 
lives, but were denied their wish because of the mental deterioration of
 Mrs Arnold, a retired teacher who also suffered from Type 2 Diabetes.

Recalling their final hours on July 13, 2012, Mrs Roberts said: ‘Dad had
 said ‘mum seemed very lucid today.’

She
 said her father maintained it was up to her mother when they would 
finally die.

She said it was important it was on her mother’s terms 
because of her dementia.

She
 told how the couple talked on and off for hours that day, about acting 
out the pact which they had agreed some five years earlier.

‘Mum
 told me dad had talked to her. He had had enough and so had she. I knew
 then this was going to be the hardest day of my life.’

Mrs
 Roberts continued: ‘I asked if they were sure today was the day. They 
said it was but they wanted to watch the Proms on TV first.’

She
 mixed the drug her father had instructed her to buy over the internet 
and another that would speed up its effect.

‘I put it in a cup on dad’s 
bedside table and another cup next to mum.

'I said it would be bitter so 
they should have a chocolate afterwards. I gave them a chocolate each.

'Dad then had a whisky and mum had a port, I think. They quickly slipped 
in to a deep sleep.

‘I stood
 there in stunned silence watching them. It was surreal. I went to the 
kitchen and came back after about 30 minutes.

'I checked dad’s pulse and 
he had gone. I checked mum and she was still there so I had to go back 
out to the kitchen.’

Mrs Roberts told the coroner how, on her father's instructions, she bought drugs and stashed them away in the elderly couple's £400,000 bungalow in Newbury, Berkshire (pictured)

Mrs 
Roberts told how she then phoned her brother Stephen to break the news, 
before calling 999.

Her other brother Simon was informed an hour later.

Previously
 fit and active, Dr Arnold had developed the early stages of Parkinson’s
 disease and was left bed-ridden after his right leg had to be amputated
 in August 2011 because of a septicemic ulcer.

Mrs Arnold had been diagnosed with mixed dementia in 2003.

Prior to his own incapacitation, Dr Arnold had been her full-time carer for nine years.

The
 inquest heard the couple had tried to kill themselves in 2011, two 
months after Dr Arnold’s amputation.

They failed because the tablets 
they took were out of date.

The
 attempt was known by their relatives, who did not tell the authorities 
because they feared their parents would be split up and put into care 
homes.

Assisting a suicide is a criminal offence in England and Wales 
and carries a maximum sentence of 14 years.

In
 2010, guidelines from Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said
 action against friends or relatives who assisted out of compassion, not
 for personal gain, would be unlikely.

A post-mortem confirmed both died from taking a fatal dosage of a controlled Class B drug.

Recording
 a narrative verdict, Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford said: ‘I fully 
accept from all the evidence I’ve heard that Georgina was genuinely 
motivated by compassion and a genuine desire to carry out her parent’s 
wishes.'
