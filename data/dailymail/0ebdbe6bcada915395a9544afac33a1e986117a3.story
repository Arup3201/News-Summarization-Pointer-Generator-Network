An entrepreneur has launched a website that alerts Christmas shoppers of price cuts on goods.

With Cyber Monday just a few hours away, consumers will no doubt find Zeezaw.co.uk a useful money-saving tool.

The site uses a series of algorithms to monitor prices on Amazon, telling shoppers when gifts reach a certain price.

Users create lists of products they wish to buy and the price they are wiling to pay for them.

If that price is ever reached, the consumer will receive an email.

Jim McLauchlan,  chief executive of Zeezaw, created the site after he was stung by the world's largest retailer.

The businessman, who hopes it will help families struggling this Christmas, bought a DVD boxset, only to find its cost reduced by half a fortnight later.

He added: 'In the run-up to Christmas, the last
 week of November and first few days of December seem to be the best 
time to buy things.

'After
 December 15 is a bad mistake — prices start rising because the 
retailers know people are rushing to get their final Christmas 
presents.

'I thought that if I could get 
the computer to watch Amazon for me, monitor the price pattern and alert
 me when the price dropped, I could save a lot of money,' he said.

An investigation by The Sunday Times showed a dramatic change in prices on the site last December.

The newspaper reportedly found on December 1, 2012, a Bob Dylan CD 
box was on sale on Amazon for £8.27.

It had risen to £23.11 by December 
21, but by January 4 the price had fallen back to £8.27.

The investigation found similar difference with numerous other products, including the Game of Thrones series and a Celestron telescope.

Amazon said: 'Prices may increase or decrease based on a number of factors.

'However, our commitment is to provide the tens of millions of items available at Amazon for the lowest price possible at any given time.'

Last Cyber Monday  - December 3 2012 - Amazon said they saw more than 3.5 million items ordered on their website, at a rate of around 41 items per second.

That meant that a delivery lorry packed with Cyber Monday orders left one of Amazon's eight UK fulfilment centres every two minutes and 10 seconds.

Britons are expected to spend £312,500 every minute during Cyber Monday.

A total of £450million is expected to be spent - a 16 per cent increase on the same day last year, a study by John Lewis and Visa Europe showed.

There will be 7.7 million online transactions, equating to an average of 320,833 every hour, or 5,437 per minute.

Britons are expected to make more than 113 million visits to online stores throughout the day - with many using their last pay cheque before the big day to fund their purchases.

Total Christmas sales will be worth £72.2billion, the same as £351 per person, a 2.1 per cent rise on last year the Centre for Retail Research predicts. A third of that total figure will be online, they say.

Shoppers will spend a total of 400 million hours shopping online this December, putting it on track to be the biggest ever year for online shopping.
