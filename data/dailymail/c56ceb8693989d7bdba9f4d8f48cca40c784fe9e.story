England finished bottom of Group D in their worst World Cup performance for two generations. After being beaten by Italy and Uruguay and stumbling to a 0-0 draw with Costa Rica, JAMIE REDKNAPP and MARTIN KEOWN examine what the future holds for Roy Hodgson and his team.

Did you see any hope in the game against Costa Rica?

MARTIN KEOWN: Daniel Sturridge did well with balls over the top but he needs to put more chances away. Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere looked OK in the middle and it was good to give Luke Shaw World Cup experience. Ben Foster made some good saves and could put Joe Hart under some much-needed pressure.

JAMIE REDKNAPP: It’s difficult to judge against a team that’s already qualified and I didn’t learn much from the game. But with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard coming to the end with England, Jack Wilshere has an open goal to become our midfield general. He needs to do more, though.

Plus point: Daniel Sturridge was lively against Costa Rica, but he needs to put more chances away

What’s your main memory of England’s World Cup?

REDKNAPP: Frustration, more so than at any other tournament. We have good players but why can’t we motivate them? This was not a group of death. There were some bang average teams in there but we finished bottom of the lot. With the players we have, that is an absolute failure.

KEOWN: It’s been tough to be an Englishman abroad. In Brazil the deflation of the fans has been obvious. The locals find it funny how badly England did and for the media it’s been just as bad. England failed to make a mark and left themselves open to ridicule.

Tough times: It has not been easy being an Englishman in Brazil after the nation's failure

What one thing would you do to improve the team?

KEOWN: We need a better understanding of systems so we can change tactics and not just personnel to have an impact on games. Other teams, such as Holland and Chile, have done that in Brazil, but are we brave enough?

REDKNAPP: We have to decide how we want to play. Roy Hodgson is a natural 4-4-2 coach but the current system looks uncomfortable. We need to stop being so easy to beat and learn to see out games. I’d also like us to build a team around Ross Barkley for Euro 2016.

Central figure: Ross Barkley is the key to England's future

Who do you want to win the World Cup now?

JAMIE REDKNAPP: I never expected England to win it but to go out now is a low for English football, no matter how you look at it. I don’t mind who wins, it’s just good to see teams having a real go.

MARTIN KEOWN: I picked Neymar to be top scorer and Brazil to win it, so I’m sticking with them. When the home nation does well, the tournament ignites. It looks like the lights at the party are flickering into life.

Yellow peril: Neymar heads the scoring charts as Brazil gear up for a round of 16 encounter with Chile
