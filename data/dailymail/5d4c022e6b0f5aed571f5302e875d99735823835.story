The longest strike in Air France history finally ended yesterday - at a cost of some £280m, and 150,000 passengers having their flights cancelled.

The horrendous figures heap further humiliation on Francois Hollande’s Socialist government which proved itself powerless to end the industrial action.

Pilots and other airline staff have still not resolved their differences with management and are set to withdraw their labour all over again.

Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister, admitted that the 14-day strike had ‘penalised passengers, the company and the country’s economy’.

He said all sides in the dispute needed to ‘regain the confidence of everyone and resume the development of Air France and its subsidiary Transavia.’

The strike centred on Air France’s attempts to introduce their own low-cost subsidiary Transavia - a move which has raised fears about job security.

Air France pilots, who in some cases earn more than £200,000 a year, fear the move into the budget market will also threaten their salaries and working hours.

Negotiations will continue, but bosses said everything should be back to normal today.

The protest saw half of Air France’s fleet grounded, and saw some 110,000 tourists and 30,000 business passengers having their flights cancelled. Many more were delayed.

The massive financial loss will ensure that the already fragile company is in the red for the sixth consecutive year.

The pilots are fighting to avoid being forced to accept less attractive working conditions at Transavia, which serves holiday destinations, and competes with Ryanair and easyJet.

A Transavia captain can earn up to £140,000 a year but pilots significantly more flights than one flying for Air France.

The French republic holds a 16 percent stake in Air France-KLM, the second-largest European carrier after Germany’s Lufthansa.

Air France’s share price plunged nearly 15 percent since the stoppage began and the protest caused huge concern in France, which is currently in deep economic trouble. 

A joint statement from key industry unions included travel operators warned the strike was ‘catastrophic for the French aviation sector’.

The statement reads: ‘In a more than morose economic context, it is compromising a future that is already seriously under threat.

While the strike is officially now over, unions have warned that there can be another withdrawal of labour at almost any time.
