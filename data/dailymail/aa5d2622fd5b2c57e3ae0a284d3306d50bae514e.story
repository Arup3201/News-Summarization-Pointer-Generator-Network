The 'inconsolable' family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in a park have today spoken of their sadness that they will not see him opening his presents on Christmas Day.

The family of Ashley Woolley said that his father was at home wrapping his son's Christmas presents when the 18-year-old was attacked in a park in Chelmsford, Essex, on Thursday.

The statement came as a 17-year-old boy  was charged with murder and also threatening a person with an offensive weapon in a public place.

Mr Woolley died in hospital shortly after he was stabbed at Oaklands Park at 3.15pm on Thursday - just weeks before his 19th birthday.

Speaking today, his family said: 'Ashley's amazing smile would light up any room that he came into and he leaves behind a loving family who have lost a part of them that can never be filled.

'At 3pm on that tragic day Ashley's dad Trevor was wrapping Ashley's presents ready for Christmas but now sadly we will never see the pleasure of him opening these presents as well as the presents he would have received from his family.

'Ashley would not want any of us to be sad but at this time it's impossible not to be.'

The family said he 'lived life to the full', and enjoyed, amongst other things, free running, which they say 'would fill us with fear in case he broke something'.

They added: 'Ashley's ambition in life was to finish college and to go on to university along with his loving girlfriend Charlotte who was always there to help and support him and she is devastated by the loss of Ashley.  

Friends and family of Mr Woolley left floral tributes to him near the scene where he was murdered

The family said it was 'very humbling' to see all the people lay flowers and pay tribute to their son.

The statement continued: 'Ashley would have been 19 years old on December 30 and this is a birthday that we will never see. 

'It was planned on his birthday that Ashley's dad was going to give him the gift of driving lessons.

'Ashley leaves a brother Paul who we know he loved very much and who was a major part in Ashley's life.

Mr Woolley's family praised his friends for he emotional tributes they have left the murdered man 

'Paul, as are we, will be inconsolable at this very sad time especially considering that it is also coming up to Christmas and we would ask that the media respect our privacy and allow us to mourn our son in peace.' 

The youth charged with his murder made an appearance at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court earlier today where he was remanded in youth custody. 

He will reappear at Chelmsford Crown Court on Monday. 

Essex police were called to Oaklands Park, Moulsham Street in Chelmsford at 3.15pm on Thursday, shortly after Mr Woolley had been stabbed. 

A 19-year-old man was arrested and later released without charge in connection with the murder 

He was taken by ambulance to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital where he later died.

A murder investigation was begun by detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate and two arrests were made in the early hours of Friday.

A 19-year-old man from Maldon who was also arrested in connection with the investigation has now been released from custody without charge. 

Friends and family of Mr Woolley held a vigil last night at the gates of the park where he was killed. 

A Facebook tribute page has been opened to remember the teenager. 

Paul Woolley wrote on Facebook: 'Thank you all for your kind words and support, Ashley would have been overwhelmed, it was nice to see how many hearts he touched in such a short space of time.'

A family member added: 'Ash's memorial looked so good at night, thank you for all of the support that everyone has shown to his dearest family and friends.

'It has helped make today a more positive day of remembering the life that Ash lived.'
