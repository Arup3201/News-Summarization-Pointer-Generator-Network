Authorities say a passenger train struck people taking photos on a trestle on the California coast and one person was killed and two others were injured.

Santa Barbara County Fire spokesman Mike Eliason says the victims were among four people shooting pictures around sunset Saturday as a southbound Amtrak train approached.

Eliason says they tried to run off the trestle between Refugio State Beach and Gaviota State Park, but three were hit by the train.

'There was a slight curve west of the trestle and it came around, and the engineer and the conductor immediately sounded the horn and began applying the brakes, at which point it became a footrace against the train,' Eliason told KEYT.

A woman was thrown onto the side of a hill and died at the scene.
