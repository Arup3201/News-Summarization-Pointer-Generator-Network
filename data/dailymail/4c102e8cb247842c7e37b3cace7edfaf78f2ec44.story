An under-fire ambulance service may have been a major factor in the deaths of almost 60 patients in the past three years, according to shocking new figures.

The East of England Ambulance Trust (EEAST) has been accused of a series of alleged failings with critically ill patients left desperately waiting for ambulances.

New figures reveal the service has logged 155 serious incidents since April 2010 - with 59 relating to unexpected or avoidable deaths of patients.

They include a doubling of serious incidents in a year.

An EEAST spokesman yesterday claimed it was 'impossible' to know whether the deaths could have been prevented.

In June the trust’s bosses were mauled by MPs in Parliament leading to the resignation of five non-executive directors.

The figures come as a grieving family still wait for answers over the death of their son who waited nearly two hours for an ambulance - over four times the target response time.

Peter Nelson, 26, died from a brain haemorrhage on November 14 a short time after being eventually taken to hospital in Norwich.

His death was one of 25 serious incidents (SI) across the six counties covered by the EEAST between April and December last year.

Figures revealed by the NHS trust also show 27 SIs in 2010/11, of which 15 related to the deaths of patients.

In the 2011/12 financial year the number of SIs jumped to 51, with 17 relating to the deaths of patients, and there were 52 serious incidents in 2012/13, of which 18 related to patient deaths.

In August a blunder led to the death of teenager Elouise Keeling, 14, who died from an asthma attack on an Army Cadets sports day.

Paramedics took twice the target response time after they drove to the wrong address and a second ambulance had to be sent.

Later that year the service admitted patients were being taken to hospital in police cars because of a serious shortage in ambulances.

Between April and October police cars took casualties to A&E 41 times, including a teenager who overdosed on diazepam, a father who had slit his wrists and a woman suffering heart palpitations.

Anthony Marsh, chief executive of the West Midlands Ambulance Service, became the new CEO of EEAST last month - on a part-time basis.

An EEAST spokesman today said: 'It is important to note that in these cases, patients already had a serious clinical condition and have passed away as a result of deterioration of this condition.

'In the majority of instances the death has occurred in an acute setting after conveyance and handover to hospital, in a number of instances days later.

'It is not possible to determine whether different actions of the trust would have prevented the death of the patient.'

Bella Hellings stopped breathing after suffering a fit at her home in Thetford, Norfolk and died before ambulance crews arrived

Paul Nelson, 26, died from a brain haemorrhage after an ambulance took two hours to reach his home.

In November he 26-year-old collapsed in his bathroom in the village of Blakeney in Norfolk, after returning from a shift at a local hotel with a headache.

Mr Nelson's parents watched as his condition deteriorated, culminating in him coughing up blood and collapsing on the bathroom floor.

His father Sidney Nelson, 59, and stepmother Haylie Wardhaugh, 45, dialled 999 at 11.15pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 1am the next day - taking more than six times longer than targets dictate.

By the time he arrived at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, nothing could be done to save his life.

In September the East of England Ambulance Trust was branded chaotic by a coroner investigating the death of three-month-old Bella Hellings.

Bella stopped breathing after suffering a fit at her home in Thetford, Norfolk and died before ambulance crews arrived.

Coroner William Armstrong branded the waiting time of 26 minutes - more than three times longer than national targets dictate - ‘wholly indefensible'.

The inquest at Norfolk Coroner's Court heard how an emergency first response car struggled to find the new build house because its satnav was not up-to-date and 'there were too many blue doors'.

Nora Dennington, who died aged 73. She waited four hours for an ambulance on the day she died

In June an inquiry was opened after a 14-year-old girl died from an asthma attack while an ambulance went to the wrong address.

Paramedics were called when Elouise Keeling, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets meeting at an RAF base.

But a call handler is said to have sent the ambulance to another base seven miles away.

By the time a second ambulance arrived at the correct location, crews were unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Nora Dennington, 95, spent her last day alive waiting for an ambulance in agony - for almost four hours.

In November 2012, Eric Dennington, 73, said he felt totally helpless as he could do nothing for his dying mother Nora except try to reassure her that paramedics were on their way.

Her son Eric Dennington, of Trimley St Mary, near Ipswich, Suffolk, said that when the 999 vehicle finally arrived it was a St John Ambulance.

And in a new cruel blow the crew were not able to administer the crucial morphine his mother so desperately needed.
