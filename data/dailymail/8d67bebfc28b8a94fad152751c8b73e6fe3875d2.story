Here are the top 10 quotes from that brilliant interview. 

Aston Villa spoke to Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel in an exclusive interview this week

Sherwood on his leadership qualities

‘I think I can be a leader of men, but you’re not born with that attitude. In the maternity ward, it’s not girls, boys and natural leaders. You have to become that.’ 

Sherwood on his touchline antics and emotional nature

'I could try acting. I could sit down and make little notes and everyone would say I’ve matured. But I know that’s impossible. I can’t imagine being any different 500 games in. People thought I would calm down as a player, but I didn’t.

The day I retired I was the same lunatic that made his debut for Watford in 1987. I can’t believe the other managers are not as emotionally involved as I am, either. I think they’re all like me inside.

Sherwood says he can't believe other managers are not as emotionally involved as he is

Sherwood on his Aston Villa side

‘We’re like Everton. I don’t think we’ve got a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle. We can’t be the Crystal Palace of last year, or the West Brom of this year. Digging in, blood and thunder, lump the ball in, protecting a lead, that’s not us. Our squad is better on the ball, they’re more suited to pushing for a place in the Europa League.

Sherwood on his players stepping up

‘The players have a duty, a responsibility to fix this mess. I don’t want to hear crap about how difficult it is to play at home. Playing for a big club comes with pressure. Anyone can do it for a lesser team — but you have to have b******s to play for Aston Villa. This is a big club.

'Aston Villa are like Everton... they're not a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle'

Sherwood on not listening to criticism

‘When I was at Blackburn there were times when it was difficult. My name would be read out and there were a few groans. I didn’t care. I’d sometimes tell David Batty, “I’ll give it away more times than you’ll get it this afternoon.” 

Sherwood on Nabil Bentaleb

‘I’d watched him in training. Every day was like his last on earth. He would cry if he lost a five-a-side. He played and never looked back.

Sherwood says he loved the way Nabil Bentaleb 'played and never looked back' last season at Tottenham

Sherwood on telling Redknapp to take Bale off in the San Siro

‘Harry’s going mad. “Get f****** Gareth off?” he says. “He’s the only f****** chance we’ve got.” He keeps him on, he scores a hat-trick, gets us back to 4-3 and if it goes another 10 minutes, we win. The kid’s career springboards from that performance. 

Sherwood on playing with passion

‘The coaches used to call me Tackler Tim, or some rubbish. One day, I put one in and he said to Graham Taylor, “Why’s he keep doing that?” I’ve never forgotten his answer. “Brian, you know that shirt you wear on Saturday?” he said. “That’s the shirt he wants.” He was right, too. Take a player like Jack Grealish. I’ve had lots of chats with Jack. He knows what I think. I tell him: “I will take desire over ability every day”. Obviously, the ability can’t be too low. But if you have the ability — and he has — you’ll make it if you have desire.

Sherwood says you must have the desire and talent to make it at the top these days

Sherwood on managing players

‘So I didn’t come in here all guns blazing or wanting to be their headmaster. You can’t get personal these days, get your hair cut, and all that nonsense. You’ve got to move with the times. I left the stick at home, and the tickling brush. Now I feel I know them a bit better. Some get a whack, others a tickle.

Sherwood on Tottenham

‘I don’t want to be scrapping around; I want to take them forward. I think I did that at Tottenham. I didn’t leave a crumbling house — Mauricio Pochettino has done a good job, but he had it laid out for him, with players like Kane and Bentaleb.
