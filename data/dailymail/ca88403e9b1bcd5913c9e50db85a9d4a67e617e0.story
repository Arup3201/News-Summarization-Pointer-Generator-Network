A tiny flat in an exclusive area of London has gone on the market for £500 a month and comes with a shower underneath the bed.

The one-bedroom studio, marketed as 'cosy' and located in the 'up market area of West Kensington', comes with a bed at the top of a ladder and a kitchenette. 

It's also furnished with a table, chair, wardrobe and a chest of drawers - all within easy reach of each other.

The tiny flat comes with a bed on a mezzanine level, accessed by a ladder (left) as well as a kitchenette (right)

The Zoopla advert, which lists a rent price of £120 a week, boasts that tenants have the perk of a 'personal shower' that can be found stored away beneath the mezzanine bed.

But this does mean that they will have to share a toilet with the other residents in the building on Castletown Road.

The advert says: 'A cosy, single studio located in the heart of London's fashionable and up-market area of West Kensington, this compact mezzanine includes not only a fully furnished living area including table, chair, wardrobe and chest of draws but also a personal shower and kitchenette complete with storage. 

The Zoopla advert describes the flat, which comes with a £520 a month price tag, as 'cosy'

'This property is sure to be a popular choice with, students, working professionals and those looking for a thriving London life but at an affordable rate.'

The flat is believed to be owned by a private landlord, registered with letting agents Interlet International Lettings and Space Let.

Properties in the same postcode usually retail at around £1,000 a month and were once home to the likes of Freddie Mercury and later the rest of Queen as well as Mahatma Gandhi. 

However, housing campaign groups have blasted landlords for renting out the flat, with one describing it as 'depressing'. 

David Orr, from the National Housing Federation, told the Evening Standard: 'It's absurd and unfair that people are shelling out around half their incomes to live in homes the size of a shoebox in London. This is one of the many signs of the chronic housing crisis currently facing our capital.'

A spokesman for affordable housing campaign Priced Out also told the newspaper: 'This so-called studio is cartoonishly small and it is depressing to think that someone is willing to live there.'
