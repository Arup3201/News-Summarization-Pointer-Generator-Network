Tough sell? More than two thirds of Americans have said they are not interested in buying Apple's new smart watch 

Apple's new
smartwatch may be a tough sell, with 69 percent of Americans
indicating they are not interested in buying the gadget,
according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.

However, the survey also showed limited awareness of the
watch. 

The poll was taken after Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook
rolled out the product on Monday, and only about half of
respondents said they had heard news of the timepiece in the
last few days.

Also, in an encouraging sign for Apple, roughly 13 percent
of survey respondents who did not own an iPhone said that they
would consider buying one in order to buy an Apple Watch, which
needs an iPhone to work fully.

Apple overcame skepticism about the iPad and iPod when they
first debuted, but the survey suggests that the world's largest
technology company has work to do to make the watch ubiquitous.

The new watch, a test of Cook's leadership, is the company's
first new product in five years, and it hits stores on April 24.

It allows users to check email, listen to music and make
phone calls from their wrist. Apple will sell various versions,
from a $349 'sport' edition to a $17,000 18-karat gold
timepiece.

Ipsos surveyed 1,245 Americans online between March 9 and
March 13. The data was weighted to reflect the U.S. population
and has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage
points.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment
on the poll.

More than half of respondents, 52 percent, agreed with the
statement that smartwatches are a 'passing fad.'

One-quarter of respondents said they were interested in
purchasing the Apple Watch, but 69 percent said they had no
desire, and 6 percent said they were unsure.

Initial demand for the watch is expected to come primarily
from existing iPhone users, but its wider success is seen
depending on whether developers create enticing apps tailored to
the device, so-called killer apps.

Apple is among several large tech companies looking to
jumpstart a new market for 'wearable' electronic devices.
Samsung Electronics, Sony Corp and LG
Electronics have all released their own
smartwatches, many of them powered by software developed by
Internet company Google Inc. See graphic: http://link.reuters.com/gak82w.

But consumers have yet to cotton to the notion of wearable
devices. Google recently halted sales to consumers of Glass, a
$1,500 screen attached to glasses which were routinely mocked
for their awkward appearance.

Roughly 4.6 million smartwatches were sold globally in 2014,
according to research firm Strategy Analytics, a fraction of the
more than 1 billion smartphones sold worldwide.

Many in the tech industry hope that Apple, famous for its
marketing savvy and loyal fans, will have the power to transform
the smartwatches into a product that appeals to the general
public. Some 46 percent of respondents said that the Apple Watch
had a 'cool factor.' But only 29 percent said they were more
interested in purchasing an Apple Watch than another brand of
smartwatch.

Analysts expect that Apple will sell between 10 million and
32 million watches in 2015.
