European Council President Herman Van Rompuy yesterday threatened David Cameron with the removal of Britain’s EU budget rebate if he vetoes an inflation-busting rise in the Brussels budget.

Mr Van Rompuy warned that other countries will seek to abolish the deal which Margaret Thatcher negotiated in the 1980s when he visited Downing Street yesterday.

Without the totemic cashback scheme, Britain’s net contributions to the EU, now £12billion, would soar to £15billion a year.

Mr Van Rompuy’s warning came after 
the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg joined forces to make clear that 
Britain will not tolerate anything other than a real terms freeze when 
the 2014-2020 budget is drawn up at a summit next month.

The
European Commission has demanded a 5 per cent increase in spending over
those seven years, which would cost British taxpayers an extra 
£10billion.

Officials said 
Mr Cameron was so firm on the budget that their 100-minute long meeting 
was cut short after just 25 minutes because ‘there was nothing left to 
say’.

And the Deputy Prime Minister joined the one-to-one talks with the Belgian bureaucrat.

‘He
stressed that on this European issue, the Coalition is at one,’ a 
source close to Mr Clegg said. ‘It is simply not possible to justify a 
significant increase in the EU budget at a time when we’re asking people
to tighten their belts.’

But
Mr Van Rompuy said that there would have to be ‘a negotiation’ and then
raised the spectre of a new raid on the British rebate.

He said it would be ‘very difficult’ to get a deal at the summit if Britain digs in its heels.

A senior government source added: 
‘Van Rompuy raised the concerns of other member states and pointed out 
that there are some that question the rebate.

‘The rebate is fully justified and it is not up for negotiation.’
