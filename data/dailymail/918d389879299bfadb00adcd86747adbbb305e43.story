PM go home: A protester in Wigan yesterday

David Cameron warned last night that Britain was ‘missing out big time’ on the benefits of fracking by not drilling at enough sites in the search for shale gas.

In his most outspoken comments about the technology, the Prime Minister said it would be a ‘big mistake’ if the Government did not encourage fracking across Britain.

Mr Cameron said the Government would dispel ‘myths’ from green groups that drilling for gas would lead to earthquakes, and he dismissed fears that it could lead to water taps catching fire.

But campaigners last night accused him of lying about the dangers, as he suggested the UK should copy the US, where thousands of wells have been bored.

Addressing a question and answer  session in Lancashire, the Prime Minister said: ‘I will just give you one figure to show how much we are missing out.

'In the whole of the European Union last year there were 100 shale gas wells dug. 

‘At the same time in the United States there were 10,000.

‘Now, the EU has about three quarters as much shale gas as the US so we are missing out big time at the moment and I want to make sure Britain doesn’t miss out.

‘Their gas prices are about half the level of ours. So we would be making a big mistake if we didn’t think hard about how to encourage fracking and cheaper gas prices.’

Forty wells are expected to be drilled before the 2015 general election, half in the North West. But there could be widespread drilling across the South. Dorset, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent are thought to contain gas reserves.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Nothing is going to happen in this country unless it’s environmentally safe.

‘There are some myths that  we have to dispel. There is no question of having earthquakes and fire coming out of taps.’

But he mistakenly promised 
communities where wells are drilled that they will get £1million 
compensation – ten times the amount actually proposed.

Downing Street confirmed he had been mistaken and that Government policy has not changed.

He also told staff at Crown Paints in Darwen: ‘If people can see a direct benefit from fracking and shale gas, they will be more willing to really look at the arguments about what this will mean for their community if it goes ahead.

‘In that way we can see wells dug and we can see the benefits of shale gas here in the UK.’

But he was forced to dodge anti-fracking campaigners by sneaking into Wigan Boys and Girls Club through a children’s playground.

Protest organiser Stephen Hall, 56, said: ‘Cameron does not care about the dangers because it is all going to be in the “desolate” North. We are the ones who will have to live with the consequences.

'This is not a safe process – we know that already because the last time they drilled we had earthquakes.’ 

Gayzer Frackman, 52, who changed his name by deed poll and runs the Frack Free Fylde group, said: ‘He is not telling the truth about fracking.

‘We are worried about our water supplies and our houses toppling down and these issues need to be addressed.’

Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘Any language that implies that a decision has been taken and that people will be forced to accept fracking is bound to raise hackles and increase concerns.

‘Companies drilling the wells are well aware of the need to get people on side and do proper consultations. If they don’t do that in the Weald of Kent or the South Downs, you’re going to have an uprising.’
