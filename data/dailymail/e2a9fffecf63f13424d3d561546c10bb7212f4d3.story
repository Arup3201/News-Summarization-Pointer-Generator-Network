There is no reason why Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley couldn't one day play for Barcelona, according to Xavi. 

The pair are shining examples that the domestic game in England can develop players who are as accustom to the technical rigours of modern football as their European counterparts. 

Constant severe criticism has been levelled at the Premier League that their academies are incapable of producing youngsters able to compete at the highest level.

Ross Barkley - who has impressed for Everton over the last year - also has what it takes, says the Spaniard

That has been brought sharply into focus after Roy Hodgson's side were found wanting when up against teams who are more advanced during the last two major international tournaments.

But Xavi's endorsement - during an interview with Squawka - serves as a boost for English football.

'I think that they could [make it at Barcelona],' the Spanish midfielder said when speaking of Sterling and Barkley. 'They have incredible physical capabilities and they are good technically. 

'In Spain, we prioritise players who are technically gifted but both things are very important in football.' 

Both players look likely to form part of England's next generation as they move on from the disappointment of the summer's World Cup in Brazil.

Xavi (pictured playing against Celta Vigo at the beginning of this month) also praised Louis van Gaal

And Xavi stressed the importance of playing under the right manager as well, reserving special praise for Louis van Gaal. 

'He had great impact on me [at Barcelona]. I really enjoyed having him as a coach at such young age,' he added. 

'He would expect a lot from a player in training but at the same time he was very human. He had a lot of confidence in me and I owe him for that. 

'Sometimes I would even ask myself why. He trusted immensely in me and maybe that is why I always wanted to show him how good I was on the pitch. I believe that he is a great coach for any team.'
