Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall's baby daughter is believed to have been christened in the presence of her great-grandmother the Queen.

Mia, who was born in January, was christened at a church in Cherington, Gloucestershire, according to reports. Footage of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh was posted online.

The video on the ITV News website shows the royal couple being greeted at the gate of the church by a man who appears to be a vicar.

The clip gives the impression that there were a handful of onlookers taking in the spectacle of the royal party arriving at the church.

Phillips, an Olympic medallist and the Queen's granddaughter, has previously said she does not have a nanny, calling herself a 'full-time mother' as well as a professional sportswoman.

She has enjoyed a strong return to competing after finishing in 11th place individually at the World Equestrian Games in France in August, while the Great Britain team took silver.

The video was filmed by ITV News Wales & West of England correspondent Rupert Evelyn, who happened to have been out with his family.

He said on Twitter today: 'Been for a walk. Saw the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince William, Princess Anne, Zara and Mike.'

A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline tonight.
