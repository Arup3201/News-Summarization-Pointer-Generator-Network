Four French journalists kidnapped in Syria last June by the radical Muslim rebel group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have been found blindfolded and tied up on the Turkish border.

An unknown group brought the journalists to the border last night, the Turkish news agency Dogan reported.

The Turkish soldiers initially thought that they were smugglers but upon hearing them speak French took the four men to a police station in the town of Akcakle near the border.

The quartet – Edouard Elias, Didier François, Nicolas Hénin and Pierre Torres – are said to be in good health, says the office of the French president.

The Turkish broadcaster DHA broadcast pictures of the journalists arriving in Turkey before they were flown to other desinations.

I'm very happy to be free,’ said 53-year-old François. ‘We thank the Turkish authorities because they really helped us. And it's very nice to see the sky, to be able to walk and to be able to speak freely.’

President François Hollande learned of the journalists’ release with 
‘great relief,’ said a spokesman and was there to greet Didier François 
when he arrived at Villacoublay air base southwest of Paris earlier 
today.

The spokesman did not elaborate on the details of the men's release.

Two of the men, photographer Edouard Elias and reporter Didier François, were working for the French radio station Europe 1 when they were taken hostage on June 6 while en route to Aleppo.

Sixteen days later, Nicolas Hénin and Pierre Torres, were kidnapped. Henin was working for Le Point magazine and the French-German TV channel Arte, while Torres was reporting on municipal elections.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Syria was the most dangerous place to work in 2013 – 29 journalists were killed in the country in that year.
