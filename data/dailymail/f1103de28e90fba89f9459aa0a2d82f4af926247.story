Victim: Pc Keith Blacklock who was stabbed to death at Broadwater Farm in 1985

A man has been charged with the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock who died during the Broadwater Farm riots in 1985, prosecutors said today.

Nicholas Jacobs, 44, is accused of killing the 40-year-old officer, who was stabbed dozens of times as he tried to protect firefighters tackling a supermarket blaze during the height of the unrest in north London.

Alison Saunders from the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'Following a thorough investigation by the Metropolitan Police Service, we have decided that Nicholas Jacobs should be charged with the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock during the disorder at Broadwater Farm in October 1985.

'This decision was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. We have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to prosecute.

'We have also concluded that no further action should be taken against five other individuals suspected of taking part in the death of Pc Blakelock as there is insufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution.'

Jacobs will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court tomorrow.

Three men - Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip - were convicted in March 1987 of Pc Blakelock's murder but all three convictions were quashed four and a half years later.

Disorder: Police on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London, during the riots in which Pc Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death

Scene of the killing: Residents and children lay flowers in memory of Pc Blakelock after he was stabbed to death in Tottenham, north London, in 1985

Funeral: PC Keith Blakelock's coffin, draped in the blue Metropolitan Police flag, is carried by six policemen into St James' Church, Muswell Hill, north London

Forensic tests on pages of key interview records suggested they had been fabricated.

In 2003, Scotland Yard reopened the murder investigation after a review indicated there were possible new lines of inquiry.

In 2010 14 men were arrested in connection with Pc Blakelock's death and the attempted murder of his colleague Pc Richard Coombes.

Nine were told in August 2011 that they would face no further action, and Scotland Yard today that another four had also been released from bail.Â 

A statement released on behalf of the police officer's family said: 'The family of PC Keith Blakelock have never given up hope in getting justice for him.

'We welcome this news, and extend our eternal gratitude to the Metropolitan Police Service.'

Wrongful conviction: Winston Silcott who was one of three men jailed in 1987 for the killing of Pc Blakelock. Their convictions were later quashed amid claims that evidence had been fabricated

Not forgotten: A policewoman lays a wreath at the memorial to Pc Blakelock during a service on Muswell Hill roundabout where he worked

Finally a chance for closure: Pc Blakelock's widow Elizabeth Johnson lays her wreath at the service in 2010
