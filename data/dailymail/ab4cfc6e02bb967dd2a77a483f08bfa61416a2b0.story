The BBC has signed Phil Neville for this season's Match Of The Day - despite his 'monotone' performance in the commentary box at the World Cup.

The former Everton and Manchester United star is joining show veterans Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage and Danny Murphy alongside other newcomers Ruud Gullit and Rio Ferdinand.

The ex-defender revealed the news on Twitter, the site where hundreds of football fans slammed his punditry performance during England's opening fixture against Italy in June.

Taking the mic: Phil Neville will be a pundit on this season's Match of the Day, despite heavy criticism for his 'monotone' commentary during this summer's World Cup 

The 37-year-old posted: 'Delighted to join Match of the Day for the new season. Can't wait to get started with the team.'

Neville admitted working as a commentator was 'harder' than he thought after 445 viewers complained about his on-air performance.

Viewers criticised his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game with several Twitter users joking that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville.

Making the announcement, BBC football executive Mark Cole said: 'After 22 years, Alan Hansen will no longer be with the show, but the World Cup really showcased the strength of the new BBC punditry team. 

New role: Neville spent the latter half of the last football season as the assistance to Ryan Giggs, Manchester United's interim manager 

'We will continue to evolve the Saturday night panel and feel we have a really good blend of regular studio guests.

'Alan
 Shearer has established himself as one of the top pundits in the UK, 
while Danny Murphy and Philip Neville will regularly provide added 
tactical analysis.

'There will be strong opinions from Ruud Gullit and Robbie Savage, while Rio Ferdinand will continue to give excellent insight around his playing commitments.

'We will continue to mix our team of regular analysts with current players and managers, which featured Roy Hodgson, Thierry Henry, Vincent Kompany and Roberto Martinez last season. 

'We are confident we have put together a varied team full of insight and opinion, led by Gary Lineker, who has consistently proved to be amongst the best presenters in the UK.'

Comments: Some Twitter users today voiced their concerns over the potential quality of Neville's commentary and analysis, with one saying: 'I will have fallen asleep before it gets to our game'

'Phil Neville is on Match of the day next season? Nooooo! I will have fallen asleep before it gets to our game'

Others predicted 'he's literally going to send people to sleep' and said 'he's a human sleeping pill'.

Lawrence Thompson added: 'Phil Neville taking over Alan Hansen's spot on Match of the Day is almost as bad as David Moyes for Fergie. Sort it out BBC.'

Some posted a short video of his commentary for Tim Cahill's stunning goal for Australia v Holland during the 2014 World Cup, which had the monotone sentence: ‘There's a cross, it's a volley, goal.’

In another change, the BBC also announced that the Football League Show will now be on Sunday morning on BBC2.

Phil Neville was subject to a huge Twitter backlash during England's opening World Cup fixture against Italy because his commentary 'lacked emotion'.

It was his first appearance behind the microphone - and was under heavy scrutiny by the 15million football fans who were watching.

Several joked that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville. 

Ofcom received 445 complaints for his monotone commentary - forcing the pundit to defend himself.

After the social media storm, he told Radio 5 live: 'I think the biggest thing I learned is that co-commentary is harder than what I thought it was going to be.

'I welcome all the feedback you get and it's a welcome to the social media so you come in after a game you're hyped up, its just like playing doing a co-commentary, you're focused for 90 minutes, you turn your phone on and you’re getting some lovely messages.

He was even mocked by the police, with the South Warwickshire force’s official Twitter feed providing a string of safety advice based on his disastrous performance.

They said: 'At least we know Phil Neville won’t stir the crowds in the pubs into a frenzy. Drink sensibly,' read one message, while another claimed officers 'will be playing recordings of Phil Neville all night to keep the streets all calm and sleepy'.
