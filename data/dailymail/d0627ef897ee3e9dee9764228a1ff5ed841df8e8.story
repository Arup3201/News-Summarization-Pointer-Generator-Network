A former English Defence League activist has admitted he may have inspired Norway gunman Anders Behring Breivik.

Paul Ray said his anti-Muslim blog entitled Richard The Lionhearted could have helped inform Breivik's exhaustive 1,500 page manifesto in which he justifies the atrocities.

But he condemned the murder of 76 people in twin attacks in Oslo and Utoya on Friday as an act of 'pure evil.'

Rant: British extremist Paul Ray quotes from a Bible as he discusses why Prince William should fight the 'invasion' of Muslims from his self-imposed 'exile' in Malta

Mr Ray, 35, told The Times: 'I am being implicated as his (Breivik's) mentor. I definitely could have been his inspiration. It looks like that. But what he did was pure evil.

'I could never use what he has done to further my own beliefs. What he has done does not equate to anything I am involved in.'

It has been widely reported that 
Breivik made postings on British nationalist websites and in the 
manifesto released before the attacks he refers to a 'mentor'.

Parallels
have since been drawn with blogger Mr Ray, who leads an anti-Islam 
Knights Templar movement, but he vociferously denies having anything to 
do with the attacks.

The former EDL member, who calls himself 'Lionheart', left the UK to live in Malta in 2008 after being arrested over internet postings allegedly inciting racial hatred.

Mr Ray's extremist views call for 
Prince William to answer his 'destiny' and 'defend' his country against 
the 'modern invasion' of Muslims.

He took to his blog to further 
himself from Brievik, insisting: 'I might be a Christian fundamentalist 
who has a deep dislike for Islamic fundamentalism who looks to 
Templarism as an example.

Denial: Mr Ray says gunman Anders Behring Breivik, pictured, may have been inspired by him, but he does not condone the mass murders

'But anyone who knows me knows that I personally would play no part in such inhumane 
savagery that has no place in the civilised world.

'My mind cannot comprehend the mass murder inflicted upon the people of Norway, even though I am forced to confront the reality of it due to the fact that I have been implicated in the story surrounding it.

'Why this man could have based key bits of his manifesto on myself and others I am connected with is something I am sure the police are now trying to work out as they wonder whether we are involved with any of these ‘figment of his imagination’ cells based upon our belief in true Templarism and our political beliefs.'

In an earlier interview with website 
VBS before the Royal Wedding, he ranted that he lived in 'exile' for his
beliefs and how Holy War was inevitable between Christians and Muslims,
which chimes with Breivik's Islamaphobic rants.

He
said: 'There's an influx, an invasion of Muslims from the Middle East 
and from all around the world, coming into our countries.

The former EDL member then bizarrely 
said that Prince William was the 1,000th knight of the garter and should
take after King Arthur.

'Now more than ever we need to have a
King Arthur. And I believe Prince William has to embrace the calling 
and divine destiny that's been given to him to assume that role.'

In the interview, he said Princes' William and Harry were 'prepared' for war against Muslims.

'They have a grasp of the enemy we're now facing.'

Before launching his attacks, which 
killed a total of 76 people, Breivik wrote of his allegiance to the 
Knights Templar - which he described as a secret society created to 
carry out a crusade against Islam in Europe.

In
his manifesto, Breivik claimed the group was created at a meeting in 
London in 2002 and he was mentored by a man called 'Richard (the 
Lionhearted)'.

The medieval Knights Templar was a 
Christian military order founded in the early 12th century whose 
members, wearing white mantles with a red cross, became one of the most 
formidable fighting forces of the Crusades.

The Crusades were a series of religiously sanctioned military campaigns, called by the pope and waged by kings and nobles.

They volunteered to take up the cross with the main goal of recapturing Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim rule and restoring Christian control.

It was dissolved in 1312.

But in a separate interview with the Associated Press Mr Ray flatly denied having anything to do with the gunman and said: 'I just want the truth to come out and it proven that I'm nothing whatever to do with this.'

Mr Ray's comments came after Norway's domestic intelligence chief said there was no evidence of links between Breivik, 32, and the English far-right.

Janne Kristiansen, director of the Norwegian Police Security Service, said yesterday: 'I can tell you, at this moment in time, we don't have evidence or we don't have indications that he has been part of a broader movement or that he has been in connection with other cells or that there are other cells.'

The intelligence chief told the BBC she did not believe the killer was insane, but calculating and evil, and someone who sought the limelight.

European Union counter-terrorism officials attended an emergency meeting in Brussels yesterday and warned that radicals who share Breivik's ideology could be tempted to follow his lead.

'Clearly, one major risk is that somebody may actually try to mount a similar attack as a copycat attack or as a way of showing support,' said Tim Jones, a counter-terrorism adviser.

EU interior ministers are to meet to discuss responses to the Norway massacre in September.

Meanwhile, Norwegian police are due to question Breivik for the second time today in relation to information that has emerged over the past few days, according to reports.

Breivik has admitted setting off a car bomb in the government district of Oslo, killing at least eight people, and carrying out a shooting spree at the ruling Labour Party's annual youth camp on nearby Utoya island, where 68 people died.

However, he denies criminal responsibility and has pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces.

Norwegian officials last night released the names of another 24 victims and more are expected over the coming days.
