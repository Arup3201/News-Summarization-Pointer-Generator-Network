Peers seem to have forgotten Britain is suffering a deep double dip recession after splurging £175,000 on new artworks last year.

Official House of Lords figures show that tens of thousands has been spent on sculptures, paintings and silverware during the spending spree.

The £175,000 is almost ten times more than spent a year earlier because it includes a £108,000 blow out on fresh artwork for the peers' new offices in Millbank next to Parliament.

Additions to the giant House of Lords art collection include a £7,500 portrait of suffragette Viscountess Rhondda, who fought for the rights of women to vote, by Alice Mary Burton.

There was also £25,200 splashed out on a silver piece by British maker Brett Payne.

Another £8,500 was laid out on a bust of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, and a £5,000 painting of Queen Victoria's Jubilee procession by Robert Weir Allan.

Peers get around £50,000 a year in grants from Government departments to add to the 8,000 pieces of Parliament art on display and in storage.

But they can opt to save up the money over several years and go on a huge spending spree.

The Lords has been able to build up artworks since the 17th century, and has bought up major pieces throughout the centuries to the present, with some art around 1,000 years old.

'The House of Lords works of art budget for purchases has been halved from £50,000 in 2010/11 to £25,000 in 2011/12. There will be no grant in 2012/13,' a House of Lords spokesman told MailOnline.

'In September 2011 the House of Lords opened a large new office block in Milbank House. A separate grant of £135,000 was provided to purchase works of art for the new building.

'This was a one-off expenditure which will not be repeated.

'The House of Lords art collection is a public collection and much of it is on view to the public on tours of the Palace of Westminster. It can also be viewed online on the Parliament website.'

But the spending pales in comparison to the Coalition's plans to reform the House of Lords, which will cost taxpayers nearly half a billion pounds, it has been claimed.

Labour peer and economist Lord Lipsey put the estimated cost of running a fully-elected chamber over five years at £484million, enough to fund 15,000 nurses' salaries.

It is £7million more than the previous estimates and more than five times the £91million cost of the existing House of Lords in the last five years, according to the peer.
