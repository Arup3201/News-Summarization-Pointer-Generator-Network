Thousands of South African football fans packed themselves into the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban to mourn the loss of national team captain Senzo Meyiwa.

Meyiwa was shot dead last week while apparently attempting to defend his girlfriend after burglars broke into her house near Johannesburg.

The mood in the stadium ranged between sombre and festive, with red-eyed fans sobbing during the procession of the coffin and then blowing vuvuzelas and singing chants later on.

One suspect, Zanokuhle Mbatha, has been arrested after witnesses picked him out in an identity parade. The 25-year-old briefly appeared in court on Friday and will reappear on November 11. Police had issued identikits of two black men on Tuesday.

'We've got every reason to be angry about Senzo,' Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula told the mourners. 'Justice is grinding and we will find them. We will never rest until we find all of them.'

Meyiwa's death came days after the jailing of paralympian Oscar Pistorius for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder lurking in his luxury Pretoria home in the capital of crime-ridden South Africa.

The country remains one of the world's most violent, although the murder rate been dropping gradually. Police recorded more than 17,000 murders last year, or 31 per 100,000 people - seven times the rate in the United States.

An average of 50 guns are reported lost and stolen every day from licensed owners, according to lobby group Gun Free South Africa. 

'Lest we forget, this is not the first time that an icon of this nature departs in the fashion that Senzo departed,' said Kaizer Motaung, founder of the Kaizer Chiefs, the main rivals to the Orlando Pirates club Meyiwa played for.

Thousands of people braved drizzling rain in the 85,000 Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, a short distance from the Umhlazi township where Meyiwa was born.

Most of the crowd wore the Pirates' red or black colours but there was also a sprinkling of the yellow worn by the Chiefs.

Team mates and mourners wiped away tears as they watched video clips showing father of three Meyiwa training, diving to make saves, or pumping his arms in celebration of a win.

Meyiwa had captained South Africa in their first four African Nations Cup qualifiers over the last two months without conceding a goal.
