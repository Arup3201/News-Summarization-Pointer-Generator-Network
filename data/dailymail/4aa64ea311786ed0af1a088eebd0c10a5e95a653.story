Leroy Fer has been called up as a replacement to the Holland squad for the midweek friendly against Mexico and the vital Euro 2016 qualifier against Latvia.

Fer was left out of the initial squad for the two games but the Dutch Football Association confirmed the QPR midfielder comes in for Davy Klaassen of Ajax, who has a muscle strain.

The Dutch host Mexico on Wednesday and then must beat Latvia on Sunday to kick-start their faltering Euro 2016 qualifying campaign and ease the pressure on under-fire coach Guus Hiddink.

Holland are currently six points off the pace in Group A after suffering a surprise 2-0 defeat to leaders Iceland last month.

Iceland and Czech Republic have both recorded perfect starts to the campaign, putting Hiddink's side in danger of missing out on one of the top two spots.
