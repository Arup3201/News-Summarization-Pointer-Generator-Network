A woman on a shopping trip has been shot in broad daylight after being caught in the crossfire of a shootout between two rival gangsters.

The 30-year-old, who remains in hospital, was on her way home in Peckham, south London, when she was hit in the lower back by the stray bullet.

Police believe she was shot during a row between two men who both fled the scene yesterday afternoon.

'Police were called at around 5.15pm on Sunday to Bournemouth Road close to Rye Lane in SE15, following reports of shots fired,' a Met spokesman said.

'A 30-year-old woman suffering a gunshot wound was taken by ambulance to a south London hospital where her condition remains stable.

'The woman was an innocent victim who was hit by a shot fired during a dispute between two men. Both men made off separately from the scene.'

 Kamaleswaran took a bullet in the chest as she played beside her 
parents in the aisle of her uncleâ€™s grocery shop in Stockwell in March 
last year.

Today investigators are appealing for 
help in tracking down the two men involved in this latest shooting - 
no-one has been arrested.

Detective Inspector Ray Keating, leading the investigation, said: 'This was a busy area and it was still daylight after 5pm.

'I am appealing to the many people who were in that area to come forward and speak to us if they saw anything suspicious or have any information.'

Any witnesses to the incident, or anyone with information that may assist police, should call the Trident South Shootings Team on 020 8785 8580 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
