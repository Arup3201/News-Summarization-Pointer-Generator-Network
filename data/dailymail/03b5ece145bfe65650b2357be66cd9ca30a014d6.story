Three sisters who brought their 80-year-old mother into A&E after a fall and watched her condition deteriorate over one week have spoken about the trauma of watching a parent pass away, whatever their age.

Rose Watson was admitted to King's College Hospital after she'd had a fall in her south-east London home and, unable to get up, had lain on the floor alone for six hours.

Rose finally managed to contact a doctor, who visited, checked her over and sat her back in bed, but when Rose's three daughters Debbie, Sandra and Christine arrived they were horrified at how unwell their mother looked, immediately phoning an ambulance to take her to A&E.

The 'Three Sisters' episode of 24 Hours in A&E features siblings Debbie, Sandra and Christine

Speaking to MailOnline, Debbie said: 'She was very ill since the October before the February in 2012 when she went in. She had bad lungs, a hip replacement, two valves in her heart, pneumonia twice, skin complaints, a hameatoma in her leg, chest infections... there were lots of issues.

'She hated going in to hospitals, though, because she didn't want to be a burden! She always found some way of getting out of going in, and if she was in she'd lie in order to escape.

'But when we saw her after her fall we knew she was deteriorating. She looked awful. We knew immediately, in our heart of hearts, that something was very wrong.'

Rose, whose story has been documented in 24 Hours In A&E which airs tonight on Channel 4, was admitted to hospital and her daughters were told that if her condition worsened she would not be put on a ventilator or resuscitated since there was nothing that could be done - it would only prolong the inevitable.

'It was only when they said that, that we knew she wasn't going to make it. It was awful. You take people to hospital to get them better, so when the doctors - who were all absolute angels - say they're not going to save someone, it's a big punch.

'Trying to contemplate how you're going to live without your mum. It's hard at any age. It was over a year ago but I could still cry about it now.

'It's strange, but our dad died eight years before, and when you lose both you really do feel like an orphan. You still feel that loss.'

The sisters took their mother into A&E after a fall and watched her condition deteriorate over one week

Rose's three daughters and her son Michael chose not to tell their mother how ill she was, instead telling her everything was fine in order not to make her anxious.

'We were devastated not to be able to properly say goodbye and that we loved her one last time, but we didn't want to all start saying it because then she would have known something bad was happening.

'It must be awful to know you're dying but that there's nothing you can do about it. I'd hate to be told that, and the thought of putting my children through what we went through with mum kills me.

'But it would have been selfish to tell her what was really happening to her. The way we did it she wasn't anxious or worried: we stayed with her in the family room all week, and we were all having the same old funny family banter we always had and doing the crossword together right up until the end!

'In the show it looks like we were having a party round her bed, but really we just wanted her to know that we were happy and all OK and that we were there for her. We had to hide our crying from her to keep her calm.'

In the end, the sisters think Rose had made peace with what was happening.

Debbie said: 'There were telltale signs. She held my sister's hand and patted it in an unusual way, like she was trying to make us feel better, and she told us she loved us. She seemed peaceful, like she wasn't fighting it. I hope that afterwards she met my dad up there and they're having a good time together.'

Speaking about her mother as a young woman, Debbie said: 'She was just the best mum in the world: wonderful, unselfish, always put everyone else first.

'We were her life. She didn't go out 
dancing, she always stayed in and looked after us in our east London home. She was very homely, all her
money went on us, buying clothes for us and cooking all the cockney recipes and telling us tales of the east end.

'The funny thing is, our mum is the last person in the world who would ever have signed up for anything like a TV show. When we came into the hospital and the staff said she'd agreed to filming we thought she must have been delirious with medication and high on oxygen.

'But she just said, "Tell the kids to eat their hearts out with X-Factor, I'm going to be on telly before they will", and she was right! We still have no idea why she did it, but with all the spin-offs and media attention and interesting people we've met... it's like her way of staying with us and keeping the family together.

'The people who worked on the programme, like the hospital staff, were amazing. So kind and lovely and respectful. Everyone has gone above and beyond the call of duty.

'The thing is, Mum's life was always about helping others, and now this is her time. People are still talking about her, and if she helps just one person deal with a similar situation, that's a good thing.'
