They are renowned for their stony expressions, and ability to remain entirely focused on their job, even in the face of hoards of tourists armed with cameras.

But this guard apparently did not get the memo - as he pulls faces and sticks out his tongue on camera.

The video, apparently showing the soldier grinning, shaking his bearskin and sticking out his tongue from a guard's box out was apparently taken by a visitor to Buckingham Palace.

Not maintaining his cool: This guard broke with tradition of a stony face, pulling faces and sticking out his tongue on camera

He is then seen marching up and down outside the palace as the tourist continues to film.

Those who guard the Queen at the palace are famous for remaining entirely focused on the job, despite surrounding distractions, and often remain impassive as tourists approach them.

They guard royal residences in London and are a popular subject for tourists taking pictures.

It is traditional for them to remain without expression - despite the constant attentions of passers by armed with cameras.

The video of the smiling guard has received mixed reactions on YouTube, with some finding it funny and others stating that it is disrespectful.

It is not clear whether the guardsman is genuine, or whether the video is a clever prank.

An MoD spokesperson said they were aware of the video and were investigating it.

She said: 'We are aware of the video and will investigate its authenticity.

'Should any member of personnel be found to have fallen below expected standards of behaviour, they may be subject to disciplinary action.'

protecting official Royal residences.

The units, manned by fully-trained, serving soldiers, have more than 350 years of history and have defended monarchs since Charles II took the throne after the English Restoration in 1660.

There are thought to be guidelines in place for guardsmen to deal with nuisances, which begins with stamping their feet and shouting.

Raising a rifle is considered a 'final warning', after which the guardsmen is allowed to detain the person in question.

Earlier this year an American tourist managed to raise a giggle from a solider dressed in the uniform of the Household Cavalry Regiment while rolling out a strong of jokes.
