Embattled Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city's five police unions are cooling off tensions at least until the two NYPD officers who were brutally murdered over the weekend are put to rest.

De Blasio has been under heavy fire from the unions serving the NYPD's 35,000 employees for what they have called an anti-police stance from City Hall. 

But on Monday, hours after visiting the family of the slain, the mayor and police Commissioner Bill Bratton asked for a cease fire from all sides — with no protests or politicking until families and friends can properly mourn and bury officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton on Monday met with the leaders of the city's five police unions, who agreed to hold off on protests until the slain officers can be properly memorialized

'This is a time for every New Yorker to think about these families—focus on these families, put them first,' de Blasio told reporters at NYPD headquarters.  'We can do that by respecting their pain, respecting their time of mourning.

'I'm asking everyone across the spectrum to put aside protests, put aside demonstrations until these funerals are past. Let's focus just on these families and what they've lost.

'I think that's the way to build toward a more unified, decent city.'

Bratton said he spoke with the heads of NYPD's five unions on Monday and they agreed to focus on the fallen Finest.

'After the funerals, then we can continue the dialogue that has begun about issues and differences that exist,' the commissioner said. 'I think it's appropriate that the focus has to be on our fallen officers' families.'

Ramos will be mourned at a viewing service Friday at Christ Tabernacle in Glendale, Queens, and buried the following day. Liu's funereal arrangements are pending the arrival of his family from China. 

 De Blasio's visit comes a day after Ramos' family said they were disappointed that the mayor hadn't stopped by to offer them condolences

De Blasio stopped for a somber visit the distraught families of officers Ramos and Liu, who were assassinated by a deranged killer hellbent on killing cops as retribution for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.

The mayor said the families of the officers 'are now our family and we will stand with them.'

'They are suffering an unspeakable pain right now,' added de Blasio, who was accompanied by first lady Chirlane McCray and police Commissioner Bill Bratton in visiting Liu's home and Ramos' distraught widow and two teenage sons.

'Our first obligation is to respect these families in mourning,' he said. 'Our first obligation is to stand by them in every way we can — and I call upon everyone to focus on these families in these next days.' 

The shooting was 'an attack on every single New Yorker and we have to see it as such,' de Blasio concluded.

NYPD boss Bratton on Sunday received a call from President Obama expressing condolences and an offer of 'full support' in handling this crisis.

De Blasio, meanwhile, appears to have been snubbed by the White House.

Officers Ramos and Liu were sitting in their squad car in Brooklyn's crime-ridden Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood Saturday when shooter Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, killed them 'execution style.'

Brinsley posted a series of posts on social media decrying police action and saying he would 'put wings on pigs' over the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown and the chokehold death of Staten Island father Eric Garner. 

Cops and NYPD supporters have publicly criticized Mayor de Blasio because he didn't throw his blind support behind police. 

Many cops in New York City have signed a pledge asking the mayor to not attend their funerals if they die in the line of duty.

On Saturday, as dozens of police stood in a hospital hallway after hearing news of the Brooklyn slayings, many turned their backs to de Blasio as he walked in.

Police and politicians have  accused de Blasio of stoking up an atmosphere of police hatred that contributed to the police murders over the weekend.

Rudy Giuliani, mayor of the city from 1994-2001, said de Blasio should admit he was 'wrong about his view of things.'

If he were at the helm of City Hall, Giuliani would say: 'Maybe I was wrong about putting too much emphasis on police misconduct, when in fact police misconduct is a minor part of the problem.

'Community serious violent crime is a much bigger part of the problem. I think I would say to them, the people who are saving black lives in the city are you: the New York City Police Department.'

Former New York governor George Pataki also piled in, calling the killings a 'predictable outcome of the mayor's behavior.

Bratton shot back accusations that the mayor is to blame for an increase threat to officers.

'I don't believe that at all,' the NYPD boss said on NBC's 'Today Show.

'I've spent a lot of time with this man. I have received this year over $400 million outside of my normal budget to improve our training, to improve our facilities, to acquire technology.'

NYPD brass and de Blasio are expected to hold a press conference at the department's 1 Police Plaza headquarters this afternoon.

The grieving son of a New York City police officer shot dead execution style on a Brooklyn street Saturday posted a heart-wrenching goodbye to his slain father to Facebook.

Jaden Ramos, 13, will never see his father Rafael Ramos again after he was murdered along with his partner 'just for being a police officer,' heartbroken Ramos said.

Once given the incomprehensible news, Ramos took to social media to publicly celebrate his adoring father and condemn his cold-blooded killer.

'Today I had to say bye to my father. He was their for me everyday of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer,' Jaden posted.

He continued: 'Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.'

It was a somber addendum to an earlier December post in which he honored his dad's 40th birthday.

'Happy birthday to the best dad in the world, you are always there for me even when it's almost impossible,' he wrote December 9. 'We have so many good times it's not even funny, I love you so much.'

Officer Ramos' family on Sunday said they were 'disappointed' that de Blasio hadn't visited them to express his condolences.

'It would be nice for him to come here and say something to us that can lift our spirits and give us hope for the future,” cousin Ronnie Gonzalez, 54, told the New York Daily News. 

At the time, the mayor and Commissioner Bratton had been attending a somber mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Meanwhile, Gov. Andrew Cuomo stopped by the Ramos' home in Brooklyn's Cypress Hill neighborhood as the heartbroken family sought 'some wisdom, some answers,' the New York Post reported.

'It’s just unimaginable, there are no words,' the governor said afterward, according to the newspaper. 

Cuomo was asked: 'Why, why my dad? What has my dad done? What did my dad do wrong?'

 'The truth is, his father did everything right,' he said afterward, according to the Post. 'His father was a beautiful public servant who protected me and my family and you and your family and we have to remember that this holiday season.'
