Olympic skicross racer Maria Komissarova of Russia has undergone a 6Â½-hour operation on her broken and dislocated spine following a serious training accident at Sochi on Saturday.

Russian freestyle ski federation spokesman Mikhail Verzeba said Komissarova fractured the 12th dorsal vertebrae in her lower-middle back and was taken to a hospital near the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park for emergency surgery.

So serious was her condition, Komissarova could not be transported to Moscow.

'The operation is over ... it's been successful,' Verzeba said.

'When our doctor discusses everything with the hospital medics, we are going to issue a statement and post it on our site.'

Maria Komissarova broke and dislocated her spine during an Olympic training accident at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia on Saturday, Feb. 15, 2014, and was taken into emergency surgery

The International Olympic Committee was monitoring the situation.

President Thomas Bach said: 'Our thoughts are with the athlete and we wish her a full and speedy recovery.'

The 23-year-old Komissarova was practicing for next Friday's contest on a sunny morning on the 1,200-meter course, which has nine banked turns and 25 jumps.

In the main competition, six skiers race against each other, with the top three advancing through heats until the final.

Normally during practice runs, skiers are on the course themselves, or traveling down the mountain in loosely packed bunches.

Jenny Wiedeke, spokeswoman for the International Ski Federation, said the accident occurred on a series of jumps near the top of the course and that Komissarova fell while exiting the third jump.

She was taken by sled to the medical services tent, and from there to the hospital.

Team doctors decided to do the surgery immediately instead of transporting Komissarova down the mountain.

Komissarova is ranked 33rd in the current World Cup standings and recovered from a leg injury last year to qualify for the Olympics.

Her best World Cup finish was a second-place at a race in Switzerland in 2012.

At the same event, Canadian skicross racer Nik Zoricic suffered fatal head injuries in a crash near the final jump of a heat in the men's race.

'Nik's death wasn't anything that happened with contact,' American racer John Teller said.

'But we all understand how dangerous it is.'

Teller said the biggest concern for any skicross racer comes during the racing part, not training or qualifications, which are individual runs down the mountain.

He said most of the competitors had been complimentary of the course setup for the Sochi Games but labeled it a 'bigger course'.

'It's like a North American style course,' he said.

'We race skicross all year long in Europe. They tend to be smaller courses. I feel like this course is more of an X Games style of course.'
