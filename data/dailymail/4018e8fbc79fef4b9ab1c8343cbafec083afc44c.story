Some may say that a cafe with no bacon is like a pub with no beer but a business has been forced to take the popular breakfast item off the menu.

The smell of bacon cooking can really get your taste buds going but a bridal store in the Wintergarden shopping centre in Brisbane, Queensland has complained about the fatty aroma coming through the air conditioning vents from the nearby Gramercy Coffee cafe.

After cooking bacon since January last year, cafe owner Mitch Suchowacki received a letter from the centre's management last month pointing out that his lease did not allow him to cook items that required an extraction fan.

Mr Suchowacki said he had been approached by management earlier in the year about the quantity of bacon being cooked.

'We used to just fry it on the grill which was quite smelly I guess, so then we started baking it in the oven which heavily reduced the smell and we thought everything was good because we hadn't heard anything since that,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

But now the bacon has had to be replaced on the menu with jamon - thinly sliced cured ham.

Mr Suchowacki is disappointed about the way the issue had been handled with Winnie bridal shop.

'We have had zero communication with the bridal store which has frustrated me a little bit,' he said. 

'If they had just approached us I would have been very happy to look at the options, or rework our menu, or do whatever is possible because we don't really want to be at odds with another tenant.'

However, Mr Suchowacki understands why his fellow tenant was upset about the situation.

'I would not be happy if I felt that a smell detracted from business - so I really get where they are coming from but i just felt that the way it was handled by themselves and management wasn't an appropriate way to do it.'

But he added that there also needed to be a 'level playing field'.

'You can always smell different things from the food court and I think that's an attractive part of the centre - to have a bit of a sensory experience, so I'm not sure why we are the only ones who have this issue when there is so much going on in the centre,'he said.

The Wintergarden shopping centre's management was uncontactable on Sunday but The Courier Mail reported that a centre spokesperson said the cafe's lease stated that cooking bacon 'is not and has never been permissible'.

Mr Suchowacki said most customers had accepted the menu item exchange with only a few upset that they can't have their 'Saturday morning bacon and eggs.'

Daily Mail Australia contacted the Winnie bridal shop but did not hear back before publication.
