The second-largest school district in California is raising eyebrows after its police force recently acquired a military-grade armored vehicle.

The San Diego Unified School District now has a 14-ton M-RAP — short for mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle — that American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan usually ride into combat to protect them against explosives.

The $700,000 tank was donated to the school district under a military program that distributes surplus military equipment to local police agencies.

The federal initiative has come under heavy criticism after police in Ferguson, Missouri, used military weapons usually reserved for trained US Marines against regular citizens protesting the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18.

The armored vehicle has been stripped of any weaponry and will possibly be painted white to resemble an ambulance. It only cost the school district $5,000 for shipping from Texas, KSWB reported.

But even within the school district, officials are questioning the need for such equipment.

'The symbol of having an armored vehicle in the district is not the message we want to send to schools,' school board trustee Scott Barnett told the San Diego Union-Tribune.

'But we have it now,' added Barnett, whose school board wasn't consulted when the police force applied for the tank.

'Can we leverage that vehicle to fund something we really need — new patrol cars?'

The school district's police chief, Rueben Littejohn, says the truck is intended to be used as a rescue vehicle that could evacuated up to 40 children in the event of an emergency.

'It’s not the militarization of schools,' Littlejohn told the Union-Tribune. 'The vehicle has been stripped 
of all offensive equipment and it’s been repurposed for humanitarian 
purposes.'

'After Sandy Hook there was a lot of conversation about what folks should do — what do you do for that kind of situation?' the police chief told the newspaper. 'My team took that very seriously and came up with some creative solutions, this being one of them.'

School safety expert Robert Macy disagrees.

'A school that has someone in charge of the school safety plan and 
someone in charge of what you do when someone is on campus and they 
practice the protocols — you are going to get more mileage out of that 
than many armed vehicles,' Macy, who heads the International Trauma Center, told VICE News.

'It's not as easy as putting big heavy weaponry on campus.'

'A tank is cartoonish,' he added. 'It gives the school a false sense of security.'
