Jail time: Ronnie Barker's son Adam Barker has been sentenced to 12 months behind bars after he admitted making indecent images of children

Ronnie Barker’s son caused his father ‘unquantifiable distress’ after going on the run for eight years to avoid being prosecuted  for child porn offences, a judge  said yesterday.

Adam Barker missed both his parents’ funerals and was not even aware of their deaths until ‘relatively recently’ as he hid in Hungary, a court heard.

The 44-year-old’s whereabouts  remained a mystery until he finally returned home to face justice earlier this year after running out of cash.

Yesterday he was jailed for a year after  admitting having 1,675 indecent images of children at his home, including child rape.

Sentencing, Judge Rosa Dean told him: ‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.’

Referring to a letter written by Barker’s sister to the court, she said it was clear his decision to flee ‘caused an unquantifiable distress to your family, and that must of course remain on your conscience.

'But for the court’s processes it means you prevented justice taking its course’.

Barker, a bit-part actor, was arrested in 2003 as part of Operation Ore after police traced credit card payments he made for some of the images.

During a dawn raid  on his home in Ealing, West London, he told a detective examining his computer:  ‘You’d better take it otherwise it would a dereliction of your duty.’

Barker, who appeared in the ITV detective series Wycliffe and had small parts in Monarch of the Glen, Casualty and the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, was released on bail while officers liaised with prosecutors about what charges to bring.

But he vanished leaving a note for 
his parents, which read: ‘Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police
came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my 
computer. I was arrested.

‘I
must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents.
Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away. You 
must understand that I won’t be able to contact you for quite some 
time.’

Ravinder Johal,
prosecuting, told Isleworth Crown Court: ‘What we know now is that Mr 
Barker fled to Hungary where he stayed for eight years, returning in 
July when it appears that he ran out of funds.’

Barker’s father, star of Porridge, The Two Ronnies and Open All Hours, died in 2005, the year after his son jumped bail.

He never spoke publicly about his son’s disappearance and friends said that he ‘died of a broken  heart’.

Detectives were waiting to question his son at the memorial service held at Westminster Abbey, but he did not turn up.

He also missed the funeral of his mother Joy, who died aged 78 after a short illness last January, leaving him an inheritance of £2million.

It remains unclear whether he will collect it. Simon Ray, defending, said Barker had not been aware of their deaths until recently.

‘This is a source of sorrow and grief for him. He is profoundly sorry for the fact that is caused distress for his family. He accepts that what he did was wholly wrong.’

Barker claims that he did not  own a computer and never viewed child pornography during his time in Budapest.

However, the judge said: ‘Nobody is in a position to know what he was up to in Hungary.’

Barker pleaded guilty to 20 counts of child porn between January 1999 and June 2003.Of the 1,675 images and videos in his possession, 92 were graded level four – the second highest category.

Barker showed no emotion as he was jailed yesterday. None of his family attended the hearing.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
