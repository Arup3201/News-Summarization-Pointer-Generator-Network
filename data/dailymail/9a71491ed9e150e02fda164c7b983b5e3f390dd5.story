A female estate agent who avoided jail for glassing a man - despite it being her 18th conviction for assault - has been given yet another let-off for breaching her suspended sentence.

Yasmin Thomas, 21, left victim Ronnie Lee with a deep gash very close to his eye after she set upon him with a broken glass following a row in a nightclub in Bournemouth, Dorset.

With all her previous convictions for assault and battery before she was 18, a judge branded her history ‘breathtaking’ - saying it was one of the worst he had ever seen of a woman her age.

Yet she walked free from court in August after being handed a 12-month sentence suspended for two years, 80 hours of community service and ordered to go on an anger management course.

Thomas, who was fired from her job as a result of her actions, has now been hauled back before the same court after breaking the terms of her ‘compliance sessions’ three times in two months.

However Judge John Harrow, who sentenced her four months ago, said he was prepared to give Thomas ‘a chance’ and allow her to walk free from court.

He also said he would not reveal details about Thomas’s past in open court in case she found them embarrassing.

Judge Harrow told her at Bournemouth Crown Court: ‘Those guilty of a breach are almost all given one chance. I hope you understand that you had been given a chance.’

Thomas has displayed 'unacceptable behaviour' three times since she was sentenced for the attack

He warned Thomas she would be jailed if she broke the rules again. He added: ‘If you don’t comply with all conditions to the letter you are going to go through that door at the back.’

Thomas was arrested in February after she attacked Mr Lee, a stranger, in Bar So nightclub in Bournemouth.

The pair got into a row over a dropped E-cigarette. Thomas picked it up and thrust it at Mr Lee saying: ‘Are you not going to say thank you? Who do you think you are?’

She then lunged towards him with a broken glass, causing a serious gash to his left eyelid which needed stitches and two smaller cuts to his face.

The injuries were so close to his eye that Mr Lee feared he would lose it. Tiny shards of glass were later removed from his eye.

Thomas, from Bournemouth, was ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to Mr Lee, and £150 in costs. She had worked as a sales negotiator at an estate agents but was later fired from the position.

The court heard Thomas had displayed ‘unacceptable behaviour’ three times since she was sentenced for the attack.

Tom Evans, defending, said Thomas’s mother had suffered a stroke on one of the days when a breach occurred, and that she was afraid she might have cancer.

He said: ‘She accepts her behaviour was unacceptable. As is clear from her letter, she says there was no excuse for her behaviour.’
