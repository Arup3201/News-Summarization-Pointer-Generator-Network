A man has been jailed for just eight years after shaking and killing his partner’s son in a fit of rage.

Craig Lewis broke Kieron Barley’s back and the toddler spent the last weeks of his life in agony after medical staff failed to diagnose the fracture.

Kieron was in and out of hospital for four days after Lewis smashed him into the ground in a fit of anger.

The 32-year-old electrician was sentenced to jail for manslaughter after admitting attacking the defenceless toddler.

Kieron,
 aged 22 months, underwent a battery of tests in hospital but was 
allowed to go home after doctors diagnosed a tummy upset.

It was only 
three weeks later, after he suffered a fatal brain injury from a second 
attack  by Lewis, that they realised his spine was fractured in  two 
places.

Last night, 
Birmingham’s child protection authorities, already severely criticised 
over cases, were plunged into fresh controversy for failing the tragic 
toddler.

Jailed: Craig Lewis and Louise Barley have both been imprisoned in connection with 22-month-old son Kieron

The tragedy bears haunting echoes of the death of Baby P in 
Haringey, North London – another case in which doctors failed to 
diagnose a broken back. Details of Kieron’s pain and suffering in the 
weeks before his death were revealed for the first time yesterday as his
 mother and her partner were jailed.

The
 day after the first attack, Lewis, a father of four, casually went on 
holiday to a Center Parcs resort with his twin six-year-old girls from a
 previous relationship.

His 
girlfriend, Louise Barley, 26, was jailed for 15 months after admitting 
neglecting her son in the chaotic weeks after the first attack.

Kieron Barley died after receiving the brunt of two attacks by his mother's boyfriend which caused him 'catastrophic damage'

Lewis
 first called paramedics to the family home in King’s Heath, Birmingham,
 after he was left alone with the child on the afternoon of May 28, 
2011.

He told the 999 operator that Kieron had ‘gone all floppy’ when he
 fell and hit his head while trying to walk, Birmingham Crown Court was 
told.

The family were taken 
by ambulance to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where Kieron was checked 
by two consultants and had an X-ray of his shoulder.

Kieron
 spent the next day screaming and vomiting and Barley called NHS Direct 
who told her to take him back to hospital, which she did after a delay 
of several hours.

Kieron was aged just 22 months at the time of his death from a combination immediate injuries, and ones sustained in previous attacks by Craig Lewis

After Lewis' attack on Kieron, they took him to hospital where the doctors said the toddler required more observation. Against the advice of their doctor, the couple removed the two from hospital and took him home

She told 
one official: ‘He doesn’t sleep for long and just wakes up screaming – 
if you have him on you and move slightly he screams at you.’

Kieron spent another night in hospital where he was diagnosed with ‘gastric flu’.

May 28, 2011:
 Lewis slams Kieron to the ground because he is not walking. Kieron goes
 to Birmingham Children's Hospital where doctors fail to detect his 
broken back.

May 29, 2011: Kieron taken back into Birmingham Children's Hospital after screaming and vomiting but is discharged.

May 30, 2011: Kieron taken back to Birmingham Children's Hospital where doctors diagnose possible gastroenteritis.

June 19, 2011:
 Lewis again attacks Kieron and hurls him into his cot causing bleeding 
on the brain. Kieron rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital.

June 22, 2011: Kieron dies of massive injuries.

July 7, 2011: Lewis and Barley appear in court charged with causing or allowing Kieron's death.

April 4, 2014:
 Lewis jailed for eight years after admitting manslaughter and causing 
death of a child. Barley jailed for 15 months after admitting child 
cruelty.

It
 was only after a second attack, on June 19, that experts discovered the
 appalling extent of Kieron’s original injuries.

The toddler was rushed 
to hospital after Lewis shook him and threw him into his cot in another 
rage, this time provoked by a wet nappy.

Rachel
 Brand QC, prosecuting, said: ‘Lewis lost his temper in the bedroom. He 
shook Kieron causing the child’s head to move rapidly back and forth. He
 then threw Kieron into the cot, causing his head to hit the railing.’

Paramedics
 resuscitated Kieron on the floor of his home when he suffered a heart 
attack and stopped breathing but he suffered fatal brain damage and 
never regained consciousness.

It was at this point doctors discovered two of his vertebrae had been broken.

Lewis
 and Barley were questioned by police the next day and several times 
over the next two years but repeatedly lied, claiming they had done 
nothing wrong.

It was only earlier this year, when confronted with 
overwhelming forensic evidence, that Lewis admitted inflicting the 
injuries.

A friend of the 
family described Kieron as a ‘happy, quiet little boy’. ‘When I heard 
what they did to him, I was disgusted,’ she said. ‘It’s taken way too 
long to get to this point – we need answers.’

The
 role of Birmingham Children’s Hospital, and other agencies, is at the 
centre of a serious case review which will report later this year.

A
 hospital spokesman said: ‘Based on his physical presentation and the 
information given by his mum and partner, we are satisfied that hospital
 staff acted entirely appropriately.’
