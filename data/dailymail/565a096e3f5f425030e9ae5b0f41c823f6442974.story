A woman who was told she probably only had flu when she went to hospital suffering cold sweats and pains in her arm was diagnosed four days later with cancer - on the same day her late sister was also diagnosed with the disease.

Tara Deacon is now trying to fulfill her bucket list after Hodgkin's lymphoma returned and doctors said there was nothing more they could do, seven months after younger sister Jade passed away after her own brave battle.

Tara, 26, from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, first started feeling unwell one night in 2010, when she began suffering sharp pains and bouts of cold sweats.

She drove herself to the Nambour Hospital but decided to leave when she was forced to wait for hours and still had not seen a doctor.

Lymphoma is the most common blood cancer and the third most common childhood cancer in the World.

The causes of lymphoma are not yet known. Exposure to radiation and certain chemicals puts some people at higher risk.

For people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, prognosis is generally good, with a five year survival rate of more than 87% in Australia. 

People diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Australia have a five year survival rate of 71%. 

'I thought I was having a heart attack from those sharp pains,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It took forever to see someone at the emergency room that night and my partner needed to go to work.

'I told the receptionist to not worry about it and I would just go home and sleep through it.'

'The lady told me that it could just be a cold or flu so I thought it wasn't anything serious and left.'

Tara returned the next day, when she had a CT scan of her abdomen and a bone marrow biopsy.

At the same time, she noticed her sister Jade, who was with her at hospital, had a 'massive lump on her neck' so she got checked too.

Four days later, the sisters were both told they had Hodgkin's lymphoma by a specialist at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. 

Tara  remembers started noticing sharp pains down her right arm and chest after dinner in 2010 and rushed herself to hospital

While there is no known genetic link with the disease, the sisters supported each other through chemotherapy and radiation treatment and their bone marrow transplants about four years ago.

'We supported each other through the tough battle - we just kept going,' Tara said.

Despite her determination, Jade died in February at the age of 22 when her body failed to accept her donated bone marro.

Her death left her then four year old daughter Acaica without a mother, and in the care of her dad and aunt Tara.

More tragedy was to follow - three months later Tara’s cancer returned and she was told she had only 18 months to live.

 ‘My advice to everyone is to get checked regularly, ' she said

Now, Tara has started a bucket list of things she wants to complete and will fly to NZ on Monday for a 12 day getaway with her partner Shane, who raised money to make the trip possible

Now, Tara has started a bucket list of things she wants to do and is due to fly out to New Zealand  with her partner Shane on Monday for a 12-day holiday.

‘Shane organised a fundraising (drive) to make this trip possible for me,’ she said.

‘After Christmas, around New Year's, I am hoping to hire a campervan trailer and travel to Wagga Wagga to see family or Melbourne.'

She said she is enjoying every second she has left and hopes to go up in a hot-air balloon, go on relaxing cruises and travel around parts of Australia.

In Australia in 2011, there were 1371 deaths caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 72 deaths caused by Hodgkin lymphoma. 

Lymphoma Australia chief executive Sharon Millman spoke to Daily Mail Australia, and said that lymphoma awareness in Australia needs to be on par with awareness of breast cancer and prostate cancer.

'Every two hours someone is diagnosed with lymphoma, and every five hours we lose someone to the disease,'

'At the moment a lot of people don't know anything about it, so we want to raise awareness so that when people are diagnosed they at least know what it is.'

Ms. Millman noted that often people aren't even aware that lymphoma is anything to worry about, despite it being the fifth most common cancer in the world.

'We don't want people to be afraid of the unknown. We want them to have the facts and be equipped to deal with it.'

Today is World Lymphoma Day and Lymphoma Australia is encouraging people to learn more about the disease and get themselves checked regularly.
