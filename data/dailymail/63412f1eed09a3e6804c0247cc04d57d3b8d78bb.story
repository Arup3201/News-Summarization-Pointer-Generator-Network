Fabian Delph looked like he needed a word from a senior player - Wayne Rooney? - to calm him down after his robust early challenges. He should have got a yellow for the first challenge on six minutes and did for the second on nine minutes. 

Only last week he said: 'I don’t get yellow cards any more – can you believe that? – but if you are fit enough and strong enough you can get to the ball and you don’t have to go to ground.' Put it down to competitive debut nerves.

Chiles and co soaked by the sprinklers 

Adrian Chiles did not look too enamoured with the St Jakob-Park ground staff minutes before kick-off when an earnest discussion with Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Lee Dixon was interrupted by the pitch-side ITV team being doused by sprinklers. 

‘We’re just calling for towels,’ said Chiles as around £4,000 worth of designer suits were quickly ruined.

Team unite to copy rugby team in national anthem

England were starting a new era and as well as singing the national anthem the new guard embraced each other, arms around shoulders, like the rugby team, as they sang. 

Still some way to go before they can replicate the passionate if tuneless rendition the rugby boys manage but they do appear to be trying to establish a team identity. And if looked a little formal and stiff, well, we are English don't you know? 

Identity: The England squad appeared united before kick-off and belted out the national anthem

Roy receives warm reception from home fans

At least Roy Hodgson was among friends at St Jakok-Park, one of the best grounds for atmosphere on the European circuit with its steep three-tiered sides. 

When the PA announced his name it was warmly applauded by locals, who remember how he led the Swiss side to qualification for the 1994 World Cup and Euro 96.

Pundit Terry backs captain Rooney

John Terry has backed Roy Hodgson's decision to hand Wayne Rooney the England captaincy.

The Chelsea defender, himself a former England captain said on Sky Sports: 'Wayne's the right choice to be captain.

'He's a leader in the dressing room and the training field, he sets an example on daily basis. I've been on a the receiving end of a few of the shouts from him.

'When you're not performing well in training, he's the first one to let you know.'
