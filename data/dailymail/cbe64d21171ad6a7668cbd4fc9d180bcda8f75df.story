Prince Charles has delivered an impassioned plea to save the spiralling number of over-50s shattered by redundancy from the scrapheap.

He spoke from the heart about the ‘lack of value’ suffered by many of the estimated 425,000 middle-aged men and women currently unemployed in Britain.

But he also talked with pride about a charity he has set up to help mature workers who are out of a job or facing the threat of redundancy to start their own business.

PRIME – The Prince’s Initiative For Mature Enterprise – is the only organisation of its kind in the country to offer business advice and mentoring to older people and has already helped more than 23,000 in England and Wales.

Charles said: ‘People feel they have no value any more and once you’re made redundant clearly it’s very difficult.

‘The great thing about all this effort is that no one should be afraid of backing someone because of their age because at the end of the day, if it’s a good idea, it’s a good idea, whatever age you are.

‘So we aim, through PRIME, to show that there’s still life in the old dog yet! And so often we find that over-50s who start their own businesses actually are more sustainable, in terms of a percentage of the success rate, than those who are younger.

‘So I think probably age and experience and wisdom does help you.’

Speaking at St James’s Palace after a reception to celebrate the entrepreneurs PRIME has helped to create, Charles, who turns 65 himself this year, could barely hide his frustration that so many older people are effectively being put out to pasture after redundancy.

He talked about the dent in self-confidence that a once working, productive member of society can experience when they suddenly lose their job – ‘a crying shame’, he said – when so many still need to provide for their families and have a desire to contribute.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics highlight the nightmare facing a generation of older people when they are made redundant in their 50s.

Since the recession began in 2008, the number of unemployed people aged 50 and above has rocketed by nearly 80 per cent to 425,000.

Of the total, one in four has been desperately looking for work without success for more than two years – which means self-employment is a hugely attractive proposition.

Charles said that while he was proud of the work that his more well-known charity, The Prince’s Trust, had done in helping young people on to the job ladder, he felt that there was an equally important – and vulnerable – section of society that needed his help.

PRIME, set up in 1999, has actively helped to set up more than 5,000 businesses, with a surge of people seeking support in recent years.

Charles said: ‘People were writing to me, they still do, that there isn’t anything out there to give them any help.

‘We can help people who want to develop a hobby sometimes into a viable business. We run courses which give them an idea about enterprise and business plans and how you manage cashflow and marketing and all these things, and provide them with a mentor.

‘We need to spread the word that PRIME exists and we’re here to help.’
