One college student's wedding dreams came true when a generous stranger and fellow bride-to-be anonymously paid for the costly gown she had fallen in love with - but couldn't afford. 

Liz Jensen, a 21-year-old full-time student at Brigham Young University, was shopping at Elizabeth Cooper Design in Provo, Utah, when she found a $480 wedding dress which was perfect in every way – apart from the price tag.  

However, as fate would have it, an anonymous bride-to-be chose that very day to give the shop's owner, Carrie Ling, enough money to pay for any dress in the room with the promise that the donation would go to a woman who needed help buying her dream gown.

Good deed: While shopping for her wedding dress, a generous stranger anonymously paid for the dream gown that Miss Jensen could not afford. The dress (pictured) is now hanging in the student’s apartment in Utah 

'When I was told in the store that someone had paid for my wedding dress, I was overcome with emotion,' Miss Jensen told Daily Mail Online in an email. 'Never had I received such a direct answer to prayer.' 

Like most typical college students, Miss Jensen, who is seventh out of eight children, was financially strapped, but determined to finance as much of her wedding as she could on her own.

Although the shop she was visiting specialized in modest, affordable gowns that range from $300 to $550, she also had her college tuition fees to think of.

Popped the question: Mr Gillespie proposed to Miss Jensen on a winter's day with the help of some family members 

Miss Jensen revealed that before she went to her appointment to try on dresses she said a small prayer asking God to help her find a way to pay for her bridal gown if she found one.

'I knew that my tuition costs needed to be paid soon, but I also knew that if I found the right dress that morning, I would need to pay for it,' she explained. 

'The mystery fellow bride who so graciously served me on Friday was not in my room when I prayed that morning...,' she said. 'I don't know what inspired her. I don't know if it was planned, or spur-of-the-moment. But I do know that she was a direct instrument in God's hands.'

Save the date: Mr Gillespie and Miss Jensen cuddled up and smiled for the camera following his proposal last month

Miss Jensen received her 'miraculous wedding dress' from her 'anonymous angel', only a month after her fiance Jimmy Gillespie, 21, got down on one knee and proposed. 

She said she chose to share her incredible story in order to express her 'extreme gratitude and to inspire others'.

The act of kindness that was bestowed upon her has also motivated Miss Jensen to have a 'Pay It Forward' theme for the May 1 nuptials.

'You don't necessarily have to go buy a person's wedding dress to help someone,' she said. 'It is in the little things that hearts will be touched and softened. This experience has changed my lifelong perspective.'

Miss Jensen noted that is so easy be self-absorbed with our personal situations and financial struggles. 

'This experience caused me to look outside of myself and to want to do good...,' she said. 'I am excited to give to other people who need the help as I did.' 

And although her benefactor has chosen to remain anonymous, Miss Jensen wants her to know that she has an open invitation to her spring wedding.
