The three-year-old boy who recently heard for the first time in his life has already started making sounds and loves nothing more than listening to music, it was revealed today.

Grayson Clamp made headlines across the world this week when a video showing his reaction after he heard his father's voice for the first time was released.

This came after he received a breakthrough auditory brain stem implant when a normal cochlear implant failed.

His parents Nicole and Len said today that in the few weeks since the device was implanted, Grayson has started making sounds for the first time in his life.

Lively: As Grayson ran around the New Day newsroom reaching for everything, his parents revealed he has started making noises for the first time ever

Appearing on CNN's New Day, Len said:
 'It has been several weeks since the implant was activated and already 
we have seen a lot of signs of progress.

'He needs to experience as much 
sounds as possible to get used to them and associate them with an 
object,' adding that the three-year-old loves listening to all types of 
music.

Nicole spoke of her joy at watching her son experience sound for the first time.

'It was a huge sense of relief for me, just overwhelming. Seeing it work was the culmination of a long journey.'

Len added: 'It was validation of the 
plan that God set out for our lives and for Grayson's life. We got an 
overwhelming sense that God was with us.

Grayson Clamp's parents tried 
everything to help their deaf three-year-old son hear throughout his 
short life before they turned to the untested method that had never been
 used on a child in the U.S. before.

After the chip was implanted in his 
brain, Grayson - who was adopted by the Clamps as a newborn after he was
 placed in foster care - could hear for the first time in his life.

Medical breakthrough: Clamp was the first child in the Unites States to receive an auditory brain stem implant

Surgery: To implant the device that now allows him to hear, Clamp had to undergo brain surgery

'We don't know exactly what it's like 
for him,' Nicole Clamp told WBTV. 'We don't know exactly what he hears. 
His brain is still 
trying organize itself to use sound.'

Grayson is missing the cochlear nerves in his ears that allow humans to process the sounds that we hear.

After the cochlear implant failed, 
the Clamps decided to participate in a research trial at UNC Hospitals 
in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where doctors were researching the use 
of the implant on children.

Auditory brain stem implants have been
 used on adults in the U.S. since 1979. But researchers have never 
before tested the device on children - although, it is approved for use 
on children in Europe.

The
 procedure requires doctors to implant a microchip into a patient's 
brain. The microchip then helps him recognize and process sound.

The technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain, rather than the cochlea.

To date, roughly 1,000 people have undergone the procedure, with varying degrees of success - most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound. It's described as being able to hear the beat, but not the melody.

For Grayson, the device seems to be working - his parents say his face lit up when he heard his father's voice for the first time about three weeks ago.

'It's been phenomenal for us,' Len Clamp says.
