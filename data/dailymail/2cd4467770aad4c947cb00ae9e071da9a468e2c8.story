When Chris Jordan was making his way in cricket he would think of the World Cup as the ultimate. ‘It is one of those lifelong dreams,’ he said.

‘You see the World Cup as a kid and you think, "That’s where I want to be, that’s the stage I want to perform on.’ It would be everything. Who knew this is where I’d be today? 

'I kept faith through injuries and ups and downs and always had my eyes on the prize. Hopefully I’m in a position now to claim that prize.’

It is within touching distance for a gifted all-rounder who has arrived in England’s new era via the unconventional route of a childhood in Barbados before making his life in England through a scholarship at Dulwich College.

But first comes a one-day series in Sri Lanka that will make or break that dream for Jordan, who will be given the perfect chance to claim his World Cup place in the absence of the injured Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.

The man who has shown glimpses of enormous potential in his first year of international cricket but also inconsistency knows that something will have to give and someone will have to miss out when the spearheads return.

So, in effect, he has seven matches in Sri Lanka, along with the likes of Steven Finn, Chris Woakes and perhaps even Ben Stokes, to prove that he should be on the plane to Australia in January. The England attack is very much on trial.

‘Everyone is talking about the World Cup but for me it’s about staying in the moment,’ Jordan told Sportsmail. ‘We are a new side and are still getting to know each other. We need to start winning in Sri Lanka to put ourselves in a good position for the World Cup. I’ve enjoyed every minute of playing for England and international cricket is everything I expected it to be.’

But he is far from fully established yet. There have been the highs of his superlative all-round performance on his home ground in Bridgetown against West Indies in a Twenty20 international; his demolition of Sri Lanka in a one-day international at Old Trafford and his seven wickets in the final Test against India.

Yet there have also been lows, in particularly the third Test at the Ageas Bowl last summer and the one-day international in Cardiff against India when his radar went awry and Jordan looked anything like a leading England bowler.

‘I’m trying to be a world-class player, a great player, so I have to get better with both balls,’ said Jordan. ‘I couldn’t put my finger on what went wrong at Southampton. I’d just come from a game at Horsham for Sussex where I’d bowled well and taken a few wickets. 

'It was just one of those things. The first ball just didn’t come out right and it set the tone for the rest of the day. But as the series went on I got better and better and finished strongly so I’ve drawn a line under Southampton and don’t think about it any more.’

It is the stuttering run-up of Jordan’s that the purists questioned when he was prone to bowling wides last summer, particularly of someone who is such a brilliant athlete. It was born out of necessity when he spent a year on the sidelines with a serious back injury and he has no plans to tinker with it just yet.

‘I actually used to run in a lot faster and from quite a way back but after coming back for injury I worked on a more measured approach for consistency,’ said Jordan. My head is a lot more still and I can really focus on my target. It’s something that works for me but equally you’re always looking to evolve and get better so if that’s an area I can eventually make a little bit more efficient it’s something I’m more than happy to work on.

‘Everyone isn’t the same and different things work for different people so you have to have a strong character because that’s what’s got me here in the first place. But it’s my first season in international cricket and everything is not always rosy. I have been working on the negatives and keep improving.

‘I want to bowl quickly and add a few miles on to it. I think I can be over 90 miles per hour consistently, not just the odd ball here and there, but to do that I have to make sure my body is in top condition.’

His run up served him well enough when he got everything right last summer. ‘Barbados was one of the highlights for sure,’ he said. ‘I hadn’t played on that tour since the first game in Antigua and it was the first time my family had been able to watch me playing for England, around 15 or 20 of them. It couldn’t have been written any better and I enjoyed the moment with all of them. It was very special.’

He will be back in Barbados for Christmas after the Sri Lanka tour when he hopes to catch up with his old friend from Combermere School in Bridgetown, the singer Rihanna. ‘I haven’t seen her since I started playing for England but I like to think she’s still a friend and I hope to see her then,’ he added.

But first there is a World Cup place to earn.
