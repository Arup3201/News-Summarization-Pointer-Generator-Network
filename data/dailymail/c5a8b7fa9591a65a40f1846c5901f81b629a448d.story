A baby died because a hospital failed to spot a genetic fault that should have been detected before he was born, his parents have claimed.

Jasper Allibone's parents were unaware he had a rare chromosomal abnormality when he was born and claim it led to the death of their  three-month-old son.

They are now suing St George’s Hospital in south London for £300,000 for failing to spot the condition. 

Jasper's parents have begun proceedings against St Geoerge's Hopsital in Tooting for failing to provide a 'competent standard of care'

Jasper's mother Catherine, 34, gave birth to him despite having had tests which should have identified it before he was conceived.

Mrs Allibone has a rare abnormality 
known as reciprocal translocation — when bits of genetic material known 
as chromosomes break off and switch places.

Tests to identify this were carried 
out at St George’s Hospital during Mrs Allibone’s previous pregnancy which ended
in a miscarriage, but they were not scrutinised properly, the papers 
lodged at the High Court claim.

As a result, no tests were done to find out if Jasper had inherited the abnormality from his mother.

Mrs Allibone and her husband Richard, who live in Kew, south-west London, have begun proceedings in the High Court against the hospital for failing to provide a 'competent standard of care' leading to the 'horrendous ordeal' of their son’s short life.

Jasper, who was born in September 2009, suffered from severe brain and physical disabilities. His parents were told there was no prospect of improvement in his condition.

The claim details the catastrophic 
impact that Jasper’s birth had on the couple’s work and home lives, and 
the fall-out that occurred from the trauma and anxiety of dealing with 
such a severely handicapped newborn.

Mrs Allibone, 34, who works in public relations, told the London Evening Standard: 'We believe there were multiple failings in our case, but despite our horrendous ordeal we still regard the NHS very highly, predominantly due to the amazing care received at the Royal Brompton paediatric unit after Jasper was born.'

Mr Allibone, 45, who runs his own consultancy firm, said: 'No one should go through this. It is a terrible experience, and we were let down.'

Alison Eddy, a medical law expert at solicitors Irwin Mitchell who are representing the couple, said: 'Mr and Mrs Allibone started their legal action against the NHS when Jasper was alive and was likely to need a significant level of care and rehabilitation throughout his life. The couple remain committed to finding answers relating to his birth.'

A spokesman from St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust said: 'As this is an on-going legal case it is inappropriate for the trust to comment at this time.' 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
