Liverpool youngster Sam Hart was carried off on a stretcher following a nasty clash of heads during Liverpool Under 19's 3-0 win against Basle on Tuesday. 

The UEFA Youth League match was delayed for 11-minutes while Hart received oxygen and was placed onto a stretcher.

Hart, a left back who joined Liverpool from Manchester United during the 2012-13 season, was taken to hospital after receiving treatment from the medical team.

Liverpool were awaiting an update on Hart's condition from their medical team on Tuesday night.

The Reds were leading 1-0 when Hart clashed heads with an opponent before being replaced by Tom Brewitt in the 85th minute.

Neil Critchley's side managed to put the incident behind them, using the 13 minutes of stoppage time to score two goals and secure a place in the knockout stages of the UEFA Youth League in dramatic fashion.

With a 1-0 lead and needing two goals to advance at the Swiss side's expense, Daniel Cleary turned home a superb right-wing cross by Adam Phillips to seal Liverpool's progress.
