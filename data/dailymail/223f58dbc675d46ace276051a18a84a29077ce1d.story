Poor English: Daniel Ubani gave a lethal dose of morphine on his first shift after struggling to understand labels

Patients are still at risk despite new EU proposals on hospitals taking on staff without an adequate grasp of Englsish, the medical regulator has warned.

Under the proposals overseas doctors will be able to register in the
UK without being tested on their language skills or medical competence.

This
is because the EU directive says language testing can only take place 
after a doctor has had their qualifications accepted by the regulator.

And
even then language testing should only then take place if there are 
specific concerns about an individual doctor, the rules say.

The
General Medical Council said today patient safety was still at risk and
called for clarification of the detail in the directive.

Parts
of the directive suggest regulators should only intervene and language 
test doctors when there are 'serious and concrete doubt about the 
professional’s sufficient language knowledge'.

But
the GMC has called for blanket English language testing at the point of
registration, not after a doctor has already been accepted, to ensure 
no one slips through the net.

And
it believes it is important to test the language skills of all doctors,
not just when concerns have been raised about their performance.

Under
current rules the GMC also cannot test clinical competency of doctors 
coming from the EU, even though it would like to do so.

However,
the regulator welcomed a clause in the directive for member states to 
inform each other when a doctor has faced sanctions that affect their 
registration.

Niall 
Dickson, chief executive of the General Medical Council said today: 
'This proposed directive covers a number of important issues that affect
the safety of patients.

'We
are pleased to see that it includes, for the first time, a requirement 
for regulators across Europe to tell each other proactively when action 
has been taken against a doctor’s registration.

'The proposed changes on language requirements will however raise serious concerns for patients.

Tragedy: Dr Stuart Gray, whose father David Gray was killed by German doctor Daniel Ubani

'We
will study the detail carefully but it remains our view that the final 
directive should provide greater safeguards for patients.

'Over
the coming months we will continue work with the UK Government, MEPs, 
other regulators, and EU institutions to ensure that the final version 
of the directive focuses on protecting patients.'

The GMC has been pushing for stronger language testing since the case of David Gray, who died in Cambridgeshire in 2008.

He was killed by German doctor Daniel Ubani who administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine.

Dr
Ubani admitted being exhausted after getting only a couple of hours 
sleep before starting his shift in the UK, and said he was confused 
about the difference between drugs used here and in Germany.

His poor English meant he was refused work by the NHS in one part of the country but was later accepted in Cornwall.

The GP son of Mr Gray, Stuart Gray, 
said: 'If the GMC is going to be able to check the language of doctors 
at registration that is a major step forward for the safety of patients.

'But what we push for next 
is for them all to undergo checks on their clinical competence. My 
father was killed by a doctor who was found to be clinically 
incompetent.'

Andrew Lansley, the Secretary of State for Health, announced new rules earlier this year to ensure hospitals language test EU doctors

In
October, the Government said it will give the GMC stronger powers to 
test the language skills of doctors where there are concerns about their
ability to speak English.

However, this still falls short of the GMC’s desire for blanket testing at point of registration.

In
addition, the Department of Health said it would introduce new powers 
so doctors can be vetted for their language skills at local level.

NHS doctors are overseen by responsible officers, who make sure that they are appropriately trained and qualified for the role.

In
future, these officers will have a mandatory duty to check the English 
language skills of all foreign doctors before they can be employed by 
the NHS in England.

Today’s
directive also proposes introducing a voluntary 'professional card' - 
an electronic certificate which regulatory authorities could exchange 
securely over the internet.

Health
Secretary Andrew Lansley said: 'For too long patients have been let 
down by lax EU rules which have allowed doctors to operate in the UK 
without the necessary safeguards.

'That’s
why I am bringing in new rules on checking doctors’ language skills and
new powers to take action against doctors who can’t speak English 
properly.

'The EU’s 
plans for an early alert system and better sharing of information about 
the doctors that come to work in the UK are steps in the right direction
but we need to understand more of the detail behind them.

'For
example, we would need to be convinced that a common European 
professional card would bring tangible benefits and proper checking 
systems.

'Our 
overriding concern must be to protect patients from healthcare 
professionals who may not be properly skilled to do the job and we will 
do everything we can to work with the EU to achieve this.'

Elisabetta
Zanon, director of the NHS Confederation’s European office, said: 'We 
have pushed hard for some of these changes, for example the introduction
of an alert system so that countries can warn each other about 
dangerous health professionals.

'These proposals mean that regulatory bodies will be allowed to check that healthcare workers can speak good English.

'However,
the details of the Commission’s proposals are still unclear and we will
need to ensure the final wording allows the NHS to introduce checks 
which are fair and workable.'

There are thought to be thousands of European doctors and nurses working in hospitals and surgeries who have never been given language checks.

Figures show that there are some 21,000 doctors on the GMC register who gained their qualifications in EU countries.

Although the Government has urged hospitals and primary care trusts to carry out their own checks on staff before employing them in the absence of a national test, many do not.
