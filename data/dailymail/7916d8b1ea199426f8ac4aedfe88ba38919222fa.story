Mo Farah has been selected for the 5,000m and 10,000m at the European Championships in August, even though his participation at this month’s Commonwealth Games remains in doubt.

But British Athletics performance director Neil Black, who is also Farah’s physiotherapist, said he was ‘incredibly optimistic’ the 31-year-old would compete in Glasgow and did not rule out him doubling up at the Europeans, too.

Farah has said he will make a decision ‘further down the line’ about the Commonwealths as he is yet to resume full training following a two-day stay in hospital with abdominal pains earlier this month.Black said: ‘That’s the plan (for Mo to go to the Commonwealths). There’s no reason at this stage to think otherwise.

Included in the squad: But Mo Farah is still a doubt for the European Championships this summer

Top form: Farah will be hoping to secure another gold should he recover for the 5,000 and 10,000m

‘Obviously it’s impossible for him at this stage to be 100 per cent to do everything in his plans, but I know Mo really well and if there was anything he was absolutely certain he wasn’t going to be able to do he would have told us up front.’

James Dasaolu has been selected to run the 100m in Zurich, meaning Chijindu Ujah, the only British man to break 10 seconds this season, must make do with a relay spot.

Dasaolu, 26, has convinced the selectors of his fitness after running 10.03sec in each of his two races in 2014, so 20-year-old Ujah will only compete in the 4x100m despite clocking 9.96sec last month.

Both sprinters have been overlooked for the Commonwealths, meaning Ujah will not run in an individual event at a major championships in his breakthrough year.

Gunning for gold: Dasaolu has been handed the third and final 100m spot for the European Championships

Relay spot: Despite running 9.96secs this season, Chijindu Ujah must settle for a 4x100m place

Dwain Chambers and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey were already assured of the other two 100m spots in Zurich after finishing first and second at the Sainsbury’s British Championships, while Adam Gemili has opted to contest the 200m along with James Ellington and Danny Talbot.

Black said: ‘It was a fairly straightforward decision and James was very deserving of the third spot.‘CJ’s an incredibly talented young guy and he was very understanding of the circumstances.‘I don’t know if James is the favourite (for gold), but I bet there are a few people worried about him.’

Christine Ohuruogu was a surprise inclusion for the individual 400m after stating she wanted an easier season before attempting to defend her world title in 2015, while former world champion Dai Greene’s was selected in the 400m hurdles. Both athletes’ participation, however, is subject to them achieving the ‘A’ qualifying standard by August 3.

Matt Hudson-Smith, 19, was picked for the 400m after running 44.97sec on Saturday and will enter his first senior major championships as the fastest athlete in the field this season. Only Pavel Maslak has run quicker in Europe in 2014 but the Czech Republic athlete is set to miss next month’s event with a hamstring injury.
