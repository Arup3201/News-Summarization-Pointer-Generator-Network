I looked at the team sheet for the Chelsea game because I always checked it, not for one minute because I expected not to see my name. When I didn’t see it, my first thought was that there must have been some mistake.

But then I read down and saw that I was named there after all. As a substitute. An instant rage built up inside me. What the f*** was going on?

Here I was playing in the Premier League with Wigan, on a run of 123 consecutive games, stretching back to when I’d first joined them in the third tier.

For some ridiculous reason, our manager Paul Jewell clearly thought it was time for a change but I wasn’t having it.

This was bang out of order. So I went steaming down to the gaffer’s office and knocked on his door.

‘What’s the f***ing script with me being dropped, then?’ I said as I sat down opposite him. ‘Chelsea away? There’s something wrong with you, ain’t there?’

‘What do you mean?’ he said, looking unimpressed with my attitude. ‘I’ve picked the team I think will do best.’

That was like a red rag to me.

‘You cannot tell me I don’t deserve to be playing,’ I told him.

But Paul was adamant: ‘No, I think you need a rest.’

But I wasn’t listening. I was livid. ‘Look, you mean I’ve fought through a boyhood career tooth and nail, only to miss a game against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge? I don’t think so. After more than 100 games in a row, drop me for Middlesbrough or something, not against Chelsea, the title holders.’

Suddenly, I was back on the parks pitches as a kid after a defeat, or the West Lodge working men’s club after  losing at pool. There were no tears this time, just pure anger.

I stood up and yelled, ‘F***ing poxy decision that is!’ and shoved my chair away, hurling it across the floor.

I grabbed the door, but I was only halfway out of the room when Paul launched himself across his desk, shouting: ‘Who do you think you’re f***ing talking to?’

Good times: Bullard was at Wigan between 2003 and 2006, seeing them promoted twice

And as he said that he pushed on the door that I was pulling open, cracked my nose and shut my head in it.

For a split second I was in the maddest position. The manager was holding a door shut with my head stuck in it as I looked at Bill Green, the chief scout, who was sat at his desk, opposite the gaffer’s office.

I managed to grab Paul and he grabbed me at the same time, shoving me up against the wall in his office, yelling: ‘Have a bit of respect.’

‘You’ve broken me f***ing nose,’ I screamed back.

‘Have you f***ing calmed down?’

‘Yes, I’ve f***ing calmed down, now get your hands off me!’

He released his grip and I stormed out screaming, ‘He’s broken me nose’ until I got into my car.

We’d played Arsenal in their last-ever game at Highbury and we were all in the changing room after a 4-2 defeat.

Pascal Chimbonda was still in his Wigan kit as he handed Paul Jewell a card. The boss thanked him and walked out.

Our goalkeeper Mike Pollitt looked at me and whispered: ‘The gaffer thinks it’s a thank-you card, but I think it’s a transfer request.’

Seconds later, Jewell stormed back in and I was thinking Pascal’s head might soon become acquainted with that dressing room door. He marched straight over to Pascal: ‘You f***ing p****! After everything I’ve done for you, you hand in a transfer now.’

He had to be pulled away from Pascal who didn’t seem to understand what the fuss was about.

We all knew that you have to see the manager privately to hand in a transfer request, but Pascal had decided to do things differently. Maybe he’d been badly advised. Really badly advised.

I hadn’t lost it like that since I was a kid and part of me immediately regretted it. Another part of me was mentally going through the boxing moves I’d learned years before. 

I took my place on the bench at the Bridge the next day, but not before Bill Green asked me what had happened.

I blamed it all on Paul,  naturally. ‘He took a right liberty, squashing my head in the door’, I remember saying to him.

The gaffer was certainly over the scrap as he brought me on for the last 20 minutes at Chelsea, but we still lost.

After the game, we spoke about our scrap — Paul reminded me that I was lucky to get out of his office alive —and agreed to move on.

Months later, I even realised that his decision was right.
