Paranoid schizophrenic Phillip Simelane, 23, killed 16-year-old Christina Edkins on a bus in Birmingham three months after he was freed from prison without supervision or treatment

A girl of 16 was stabbed to death on a bus by a paranoid schizophrenic who had not been given proper  treatment for 12 years, a damning report reveals.

Christina Edkins died on her way to school when Phillip Simelane plunged a nine-inch kitchen knife into her chest in a tragedy that the report says could have been prevented.

Simelane, 23, was caught hours after the attack at a supermarket with the weapon in a carrier bag, and was jailed indefinitely after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Three months earlier, he had walked free from prison unsupervised despite his serious mental illness.

Yesterday’s report revealed how medical staff, police and the prison service missed a string of chances to get Simelane treatment over a 12-year period.

From April 2009 to December 2012 alone, he went through 17 mental health reviews or formal assessments by four organisations, involving a number of healthcare experts. Incredibly, none resulted in his detention under the Mental Health Act before Christina’s death on 7 March 2013.

The report, which was ordered by Birmingham Cross-City Clinical Commissioning Group, found the tragedy on the No9 bus in the city centre could have been prevented.

Review chairman Dr Alison Reed said: ‘As Christina’s death was directly related to [Simelane’s] mental illness, it could have been prevented if his mental health needs had been identified and met.’

Now a damning report has revealed that a string of social services failures spanning 12 years could have led to the fatal stabbing of Christina

The report included a victim impact 
statement from the girl’s mother, Kathleen Harris, 49, who said losing 
her daughter was like having her heart ‘ripped out’.

The 95-page document also made 51 
recommendations to improve the way information is shared between the 
NHS, prison service and police force. Christina’s family – her mother, 
father Jason Edkins, 44, brother Ryan, 19, and sister Joanne, 25, from 
Halesowen, West Midlands, said in a statement: ‘We agree that the fatal 
attack on Christina could have been prevented.

‘A paranoid psychotic was left to his 
own devices, without continued medication, a vagrant living on buses 
without help or supervision from our public services.’

Simelane began suffering mental health issues as a schoolboy and was known to mental health professionals in the West Midlands having served three prison sentences in 2012

Before Christina was killed onthe number 9 bus he spent two spells inside Hewell, near Redditch, and at Birmingham Prison in Winson Green. He had been released from custody three months before the killing but was under no supervision or reporting orders

Simelane came to Britain from 
Swaziland, southern Africa, aged nine. He was homeless and had served 
three jail terms in 2012, but was not under any supervision orders 
despite threatening his own mother with a knife months earlier. In a 
statement, his family said: ‘Our heart goes out to the other grieving 
family. An incident that could have been avoided has changed our lives 
in a tremendous way.’

James Morris, MP for Halesowen and 
Rowley Regis, and head of the all-party parliamentary group on mental 
health, said: ‘It is vital the lessons in this report are learned.’

John Short, chief executive of  
Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘We 
fully accept the review’s findings and acknowledge that we must learn 
from what happened.’

A paranoid schizophrenic stabbed a schoolgirl to death on a bus three months after he was released from prison without supervision or treatment

‘Every morning we would walk together. She would walk to the bus stop, and I would walk to work. We would give each other a kiss and say goodbye, and she always said “love you mom”. I can’t walk that way any more.

‘Some months after her death, we had a parcel delivered – it was Christina’s exam results. She had done really well. Also enclosed was the school yearbook . . . there was a quote by her headmaster: “If a school could choose its pupils it would be full of Christinas”.

‘[When I] saw this it broke my heart. I can’t explain the feeling – it is emptiness – like someone has ripped out my heart.’

Christina’s family (including father Jason,

to experience the heartache of such a meaningless and avoidable death of
 a loved one'
