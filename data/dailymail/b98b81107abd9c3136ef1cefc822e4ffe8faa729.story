When Andy and Hazel Linton received a note telling them a letter was waiting at the sorting office, they were bewildered and worried.

Fearing it could be some urgent test results from the doctor, they rushed to collect it, paying £1.53 for the privilege as it was sent without a stamp.

It was, in fact, nothing more than a slightly underwhelming Christmas card ... from their local Lib Dem MP.

The card had been sent without a stamp, which meant Mr and Mrs Linton had to fork over £1.53 for it 

Mike Thornton – who won his seat less than two years ago when he replaced disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne – has now been dubbed 'Scrooge' by some of his constituents after they were forced to pay for their cards.

The MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, had hired an agency to send out 400 'personal' Christmas greetings to local party supporters.

But some were mistakenly posted without stamps, meaning many people received a note from the postman instead.

MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, said he was 'very embarrassed by the blunder and investigating how it happened

Yesterday Mr Thornton, 62, was said to be 'very embarrassed' and was investigating how some of the stamps were forgotten. He insisted he would reimburse those who had been forced to shell out.

Lib Dem activist Mr Linton, 60, who works at Southampton docks, was waiting to hear back from his doctor when he received the postman's note on Christmas Eve. He and his wife faced an anxious three-day wait before they could pick it up, and were horrified to find out they had faced so much stress just for a card from Mr Thornton.

Featuring a child's drawing of Santa, the card had no personal message and the only word handwritten was the first name 'Mike'. Mr Linton said having to pay to pick it up was an 'insult', adding: 'It is a complete cock-up.

'MPs like to act like they have so much power and can change things but they can't even get a Christmas card right. It is unprofessional and does not bode well for him. He'll be seen as the Christmas Scrooge – he has shot himself in the foot.

'About 20 other people had turned up for similar envelopes at our sorting office – you have to ask, how many more were there across Eastleigh? I don't think he'll survive the election now.'

Mrs Linton, 59, a care worker, said she had been sick with worry thinking the letter was medical results. 'I was really angry when it was just this Christmas card,' she said.

Mr Thornton, a former mortgage broker who attended the exclusive Charterhouse School, won the Eastleigh seat in a by-election last year with a majority of 1,771. But a surge in votes for Ukip saw the Lib Dems' share of the vote fall by 14 per cent compared with 2010.

A Lib Dem spokesman said Mr Thornton was 'very embarrassed' that some stamps were missing and was investigating the error.

The MP, who is married to Peta, 54, with whom he has a 20-year-old daughter, Philippa, said last night: 'This is really unfortunate, these were personal cards paid for by myself and I will personally refund any costs incurred due to this.'
