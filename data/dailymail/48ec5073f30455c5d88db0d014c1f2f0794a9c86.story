A Japanese girl's shocking anti-Korean rant has gone viral as protests against immigrants in the country increases.

The girl is cheered by crowds during a protest in Osaka as she says she wants to kill all the Koreans living in the area.

The video, which has been seen more than 45,000 times, comes as Japan sets about preparing itself against a missile attack by North Korea.

Japanese media are reporting that the army is readying itself for another missile launch or nuclear test from the Communist country.

Threats have been increasing from Pyongyang in recent weeks, ramping up tensions in the region.

News outlets in Japan quoted the country's defence minister as saying that destroyers with missile interception systems have been put on alert.

'We are doing all we can to protect the safety of our nation,' chief 
Cabinet spokesman Yoshihide Suga was quoted as saying on Fox News.

However, he refused to elaborate on the plans.

North Korea has made repeated threats to Japan in the past weeks and there are fears the country, an ally of the U.S., would be in range of its missiles.

North Korea has unleashed a flurry of war threats and provocations over the U.N. sanctions and ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills, which the allies say are routine but Pyongyang says is a preparation for a northward invasion

It is believed the rising tensions have contributed to increasing numbers of ultra-nationalistic protests against Koreans in Japan.

Protests are regularly held but they have been growing in past weeks, according to Japan Daily Press.

The South Korean minister who said the North is showing signs it could be preparing to carry out a new nuclear test has backtracked on his comments

The girl, dressed in cat-ears and long socks, calls on Japanese people to kill Koreans living in the country.

She said Koreans living in Japan should be massacred and referred to the Massacre of Nanking, in which up to 300,000 Chinese people were killed by the Japanese in 1937.

Standing in front of rows of uniformed police, she shouts into a microphone: 'I hate the Koreans so much I can't stand it. I just want to kill them all now.

'We will start a massacre like Nanking Massacre. If the Japanese people are angry, we can do that.'

The anti-Korean protesters were met by opposition Japanese demonstrators who said their racism 'shamed' Japan.

Today, North Korea announced it was halting work at the Kaesong industrial complex, that is jointly run with the South.

The decision has been seen as a step further into isolation by North Korea, as the complex, situated north of the Demilitarized Zone, was the last sign of cooperation between the two Koreas.

There were fears the North was preparing to for a fourth nuclear test after South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo 
Kihl-jae told lawmakers there were signs of increased activity in the 
North's main nuclear test site.

However, he said a few hours later 
that he had made a mistake and claimed he could not remember making the 
statement, despite it being videoed.

sanctions for its last nuclear test, and over ongoing U.S.-South Korean 
military drills, which the allies say are routine but Pyongyang says is a
 preparation for a northward invasion.
