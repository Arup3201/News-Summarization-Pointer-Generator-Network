Supermarket giant Coles is facing a hefty fine of at least $4 million for lying to shoppers about the freshness of its bread.

Last year, Coles was found guilty for its ‘made today, sold today’ slogan, which was deemed misleading by the Federal Court in June.

The supermarket was slapped with a three-year ban to no longer promote its bread as baked on the day it is sold or made from fresh dough.

But lawyers for Coles claimed that the average shopper 'doesn't care' that the supermarket's in-store bread offering isn't entirely fresh, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

The Federal Court banned Coles from advertising its par-baked bread from being baked fresh on the day it is sold for three years

 The falsified fresh bread has generated a revenue of about $300 million for Coles

After an investigation into the marketing tactics conducted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Federal Court on Tuesday has sought penalties of at least $4-$5 million over the breaches to the Australian consumer law.

The falsely labelled bread has generated an income of around $300 million over three years before former premier Jeff Kennett found that the some of the bread that was advertised as fresh was actually made in Ireland.

In many instances, the breads were partially baked in factories overseas, frozen, and shipped to Australia months later to be sold as freshly baked loaves to consumers.

Coles was also ordered to display a Federal Court corrective notice in its stores and on its website informing shoppers that it had broken Australian consumer law by falsely advertising bread products as 'Baked Today, Sold Today' and 'Freshly Baked In-Store'.

After a thorough investigation, the ACCC is seeking $4-5million in penalties from the supermarket giant

The ban only applies to products that are partially baked off-site and then finished in-store. 

They also reported that Coles lawyer, Phillip Crutchfield, SC, said 'just because we're big, we shouldn't get hit with a record fine,' but Colin Golvan, SC, said a hefty fine was appropriate as 'this case is one in which consumers are led to the cash register on the basis of misconceptions about the manufacturing process.'
