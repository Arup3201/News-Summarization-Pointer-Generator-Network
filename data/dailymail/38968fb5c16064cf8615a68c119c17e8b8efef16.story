The search for Madeleine McCann is to move to scrubland around a water treatment plant where a prime suspect may have worked.

Portuguese police sources have revealed that British officers are due to start scouring the area near the resort of Praia da Luz on Wednesday.

A fingertip search of wasteland in the centre of Praia da Luz is due to be completed today.

It comes as it has emerged Scotland Yard detectives searching for Madeleine in Portugal have been granted permission to question their prime suspects.

Police identified eight local men 
earlier this year who they believe could hold the key to solving the 
mystery of Madeleine’s disappearance.

The suspects, three of whom
 are convicted drug dealers, were traced from phone records linking them
 to Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine was last seen alive.

Officers will next turn their focus to two areas by a small water treatment sub-station, a derelict farmhouse and an abandoned well, in their search.

Heroin addict Euclides Monteiro was working at a water and sewage plant in Lagos, four miles from the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz where Madeleine was staying with her parents, Gerry and Kate.

Ex-colleagues of Monteiro, who was born in Cape Verde, have suggested that his duties included visiting other treatment plants in the area.

Police continued to investigate the 2007 disappearance of the girl after
 she vanished from her family's holiday apartment while her parents were
 having dinner at a nearby restaurant

Monteiro
 used to work as a waiter at the Ocean Club but was sacked for stealing 
tips a year before Madeleine, then three, vanished in May 2007 – amid 
fears she had been abducted in a botched break-in by a thief looking for
 cash.

He was signed off sick several days before she disappeared and did not return to work for two months.

Suspicions about him were heightened after analysis of his mobile phone data placed him near the apartment when Madeleine vanished.

The police will then turn their focus to two different areas by a small water 
treatment sub-station, a derelict farmhouse and an abandoned wall

One of the new areas, which will be searched once this wasteland has been fully scoured, is a ten-acre area of thick undergrowth

Monteiro, who had served a jail term for burglary, died in a tractor accident, aged 40, in 2009. His widow Luisa has insisted he had nothing to do with Madeleine’s disappearance.

The two new areas reportedly due to be searched are on a back road, half  a mile from the Ocean Club. One is a ten-acre area of thick undergrowth.

It is believed that the sites were identified by British officers before they flew out to Portugal.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said yesterday: ‘We will not provide a running commentary on the progress of an investigation.’
