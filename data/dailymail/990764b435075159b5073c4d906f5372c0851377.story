Members of the Muslim community feel they were set up by police who contacted them asking for an ISIS flag during the Sydney siege, a prominent activist says.

Rebecca Kay, who converted to Islam and is now a well-known and outspoken community member, was called by an officer from NSW Police Counter-Terrorism about four hours after Man Haron Monis took 18 hostages in the Lindt café in Martin Place on December 15.

The officer said Monis was demanding an ISIS flag and asked Ms Kay to help police find one, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

She agreed to make phone calls even though she knew it would be a difficult task finding someone willing to admit they owned a flag relating to the terrorist group.

'A lot of people in the Muslim community were devastated. We were ready to jump – "just say how high" – to help police prevent a tragedy,' Ms Kay said.

Ms Kay said the officer called her back multiple times requesting she get an ISIS flag to Bankstown Police Station so it could be taken to downtown Sydney in a patrol car.

But Ms Kay said the situation compromised her relationships with some people she contacted, who were suspicious about her request and accused her of being a police informant.

The next day police searched the house of one young man she spoke to who said he had a flag but decided not to hand it over. Police also searched the homes of two other men who were contacted.

'Obviously, they were listening to all our phone calls,' Ms Kay said.

'I want to be able to have dealings with police, but when it gets thrown back in your face, it sets us back two steps.'

Counter-terrorism police also contacted Sydney man and onetime terror accused Zaky Mallah and asked him for an ISIS flag.

Mr Mallah, 30, from Westmead in western Sydney offered the Counter Terrorist police the flag that hangs on the wall of his apartment, the moderate Islamic Front flag, but 'they weren't interested'.

Police eventually found their own flag but changed their strategy and decided not to give into Monis' demands.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted police for comment. 

Monis forced his captives to relay his demands in videos uploaded to YouTube, posts on Facebook and calls to media outlets.

His demands included a phone conversation with Prime Minister Tony Abbott, to be broadcasted live on radio, a public declaration from the government that the attack was being carried out by Islamic State terrorists, and the delivery of the flag.
