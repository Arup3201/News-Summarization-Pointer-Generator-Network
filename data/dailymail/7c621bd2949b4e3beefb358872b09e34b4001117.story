A teenager rushed to his grandmother's aid, stopping her from eating a dead cricket, floating ominously in a can of fruit salad.

Sharon McBride was desperate for a sweet treat, when she opened the tin of Del Monte fruit.

But seconds later her 16-year-old grandson shouted at her to stop, after he spotted the black lifeless insect lying in among the cherries and peaches.

Conner Key raised the alarm, rushing to stop his grandmother Sharon McBride eat the dead cricket, after he spotted the bug floating at the top of a can of fruit salad

The 53-year-old said her grandson Conner Key made the discovery on Saturday.

'My mouth was feeling really dry and I really wanted something sweet to eat, so I opened the can of fruit salad,' she said.

'Inside was what looked like a baby cockroach. It looked disgusting.

'I could have been really ill if I had eaten it. It is not good enough.

'No one expects to find a dead insect in their tin of fruit salad.'

Ms McBride bought the can of fruit two weeks' ago, during her weekly shop at Heron Foods in east Hull.

She said: 'I took the can back to Heron on Sunday and the manager, along with two assistants, looked at it.

'My family and the staff at the store think it's a baby cockroach.

'It doesn't look much like a baby one to me, it's pretty big.

'The manager told me to take some photographs of it and send them to Del Monte, which is based in Middlesex, which is what I have done.'

Ms McBride said she believes Del Monte should apologise for the distress this has caused her.

She added: 'I could have been really ill if I had eaten it, it's not very nice.'

Mike Igoe, commercial director at Heron Foods, said the chain was taking the complaint seriously and would be speaking to Del Monte.

Mr Igoe said: 'We have been made aware 
that a customer purchased a Del Monte fruit cocktail from our Holderness
 Road store and reported to us that it contained a foreign body.

'We are investigating this complaint with the supplier of the product.

'In rare, isolated cases such as this, Heron Foods will always take prompt action to ensure the welfare of our customers and to ensure the high quality of the product range is maintained.

'We will continue to work closely with the manufacturer to deal with this issue.'

Dr George McGavin, an Honorary Research Associate at Oxford University Museum of Natural History and The Department of Zoology of Oxford University, told MailOnline confirmed that the insect was an adult cricket.

Del Monte were unavailable for comment this evening.
