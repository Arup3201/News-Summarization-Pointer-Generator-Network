Reggie Wayne's 14-year career with the Indianapolis Colts is over.

The 36-year-old six time Pro Bowler is second in franchise history in receptions (1,070), receiving yards (14,345), touchdown catches (80) and 100-yard games (43).

He was a cornerstone of the Colts' Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears, hauling in a 53-yard touchdown pass to open their scoring in Miami.

Wayne did not miss a game from 2003-2012, but his career stalled after an ACL injury in 2013 and an elbow injury the following year. 

Reggie Wayne joined the Colts in 2001 as a first round draft pick and won the Super Bowl in 2007

Wayne remains one of the Colts' most popular players with fans celebrating their hero in 2011

'Reggie is one of the greatest men to ever wear the horseshoe, and we have been blessed to watch him play for the past 14 years,' Colts owner Jim Irsay said in a statement.

'When he first took the field with us in 2001, we knew this day would eventually arrive. That reality is one of the things that makes pro football such a tough business.'

He remains the league's active leader in receptions and receiving yards, and third in touchdowns.
