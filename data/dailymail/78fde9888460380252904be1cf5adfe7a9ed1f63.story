Pets cause a staggering £872million worth of damage to our homes each year, according to research.

Badly behaved pets bring in dead animals, rip wallpaper, tear up pillows, chew pipes, go to the toilet where they shouldn’t and even eat up our food – to the tune of £231.50 per home per year.

Other damage includes ink stains on carpets from chewed up pens.

The study by BT found homes shell out £231.50 every year to clear up after their pets, with dogs proving to be the most badly-behaved

Nearly half of UK households have a pet, and dogs are the most likely to leave a trail of destruction – with cats not far behind.

Guinea pigs, however, are the best-behaved.

The study was carried out by BT, which now offers an HD camera which lets owners keep an eye on home alone  pets via a smartphone app.
