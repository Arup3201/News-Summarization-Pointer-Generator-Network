Michael Buckley died in hospital after breaking a hip when he was struck with a shopping trolley

The victim of a ‘trolley rage attack’ in a Marks & Spencer store has died – meaning the suspect could face murder charges.

Michael Buckley, 60, suffered a broken hip and wrist when he was knocked to the ground in a busy branch three days before Christmas.

A 30-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.

But the injured man’s condition deteriorated, he suffered a heart attack and on Tuesday he died at Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough.

Mr Buckley was a frail man who stood around 5ft 4in and weighed just 8st. Suffering from severe ear problems, he wore two hearing aids and had retired from his long-term gardening job at a cemetery due to ill health.

Following the death of his wife, Irene Christie, a model and actress, two years ago, Mr Buckley lived alone, grieving for her and caring for her macaw, Max, which had appeared in For Your Eyes Only alongside Roger Moore.

A neighbour said: ‘Michael wouldn’t say boo to a goose – he was very frail.  And I heard that in the Marks & Spencer when this woman asked to go past he said, “OK, just a minute” – but she then barged into him. 

‘I heard it wasn’t just once, but she came back for another go. Then he fell to the ground. And after he went to hospital he never came back.’

Michael Buckley and his wife Irene kept exotic birds and trained them for films including James Bond.

The incident took place in the last few days before Christmas, when stores were crammed with customers.

Mr Buckley was shopping at a large 
Marks & Spencer food hall at around 1pm, in the Glades shopping 
centre in Bromley, south-east London.

Witnesses told police the woman at the centre of the inquiry shoved him with her trolley, knocking him to the ground.

A member of staff said at the time that Mr Buckley was left sprawled on the floor in agony after the ‘moment of madness’.

The employee said: ‘She just seems to have got enraged that he did not move out of her way quickly enough and rammed into him. 

‘It is everyone’s nightmare. We have seen it so many times in the food hall, people are just so impatient these days.’ 

Another neighbour said Mr Buckley had looked ‘like a strong breeze would blow him away’.

Death: Michael Buckley, 60, has died after being knocked to the ground at The Glade shopping centre in Kent

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said:
'A 60-year-old man who was struck with a shopping trolley and knocked 
to the ground on 22 December in Bromley, Kent has died.'

They added: 'Police were called to a 
store in The Glades shopping centre, in Bromley, at 1pm on December 22, 
following reports of a man injured during an altercation.

'It is understood that the man, aged 
60, was struck with a trolley being pushed by a woman.

'He fell to the 
ground and sustained injuries including a broken hip and wrist, and was 
taken to a Kent hospital for treatment.

'On Wednesday, December 26, officers 
were informed that the man had suffered further health complications and
that he was now in a critical condition.'

A
neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she had known Mr Buckley 
for 15 years, and told News Shopper: 'He loved wildlife and he was a 
very generous man and very well liked man.'

She
said he was married to Irene, who died two years ago, and that the 
couple would go to Arizona every year on holiday because they enjoyed 
filming hummingbirds.

Shopping shock: The row allegedly broke out while the man was shopping in a Marks and Spencer

The neighbour added: 'He loved Elvis Presley and was a consummate fan. He was just a nice quiet pleasant man.' 

But she also described him as frail 
and said he had taken early retirement from the office of Camberwell New
Green Cemetery some years ago because of a knee injury.

She said: 'He wore a hearing aid and 
even though he was 60 he looked much older and looked like a strong 
breeze would blow him away.'

Staff at M & S had said the woman
appeared to have launched the attack because the man had failed to get 
out of her way fast enough.

The clash appears to be the latest in a growing number of so-called ‘trolley rage’ incidents in our supermarkets.

In November 2011, Hayley Cook, then 
a  24-year-old pregnant mother, was jailed for a year after breaking a 
woman’s pelvis outside a branch of Tesco in Ramsgate

The court heard she swore violently at Lynne White and crashing her trolley into her, also trapping her own son’s hand.

In March that year police were called to Morrisons in Weymouth, Dorset, to break up a fight between shoppers.

An elderly man was left with a head 
wound after two shoppers bumped their trolleys into each other and a 
brawl broke out.
