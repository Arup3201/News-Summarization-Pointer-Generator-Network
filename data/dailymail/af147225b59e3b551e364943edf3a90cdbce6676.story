They're every girl's secret slimming saviour - just ask fans Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey and Princess Beatrice.

But, as Renée Zellweger proved in the hilarious bedroom scene with Hugh Grant in 2001 film Bridget Jones, Spanx, whilst super slimming, aren't the sexiest undergarment. Until now.

The folks at Spanx have finally unveiled shapewear that aims to trim figures and still look good in the bedroom.

Slimming and sexy? Spanx, who are famed for their figure trimming underwear, have unveiled a new £82 lace teddy, which they say is slimming and sexy - a far cry from their more traditional shapewear

Named the Lust Have collection, the company say they've combined the most sought-after trends of the season  with their famous slimming technology to create a 'luxurious lace slimming teddy'.

Available in black and cream, the teddy comes with adjustable straps and un-structured cups to fit any bust size, whilst the poppered gusset gives a practical side to the teddy, say the makers.

One for the bedroom? Named the Lust Have collection, the garment, available in black and white, comes with lace inserts, which the brand say are inspired by this season's trends

Famous fans: Both Kim, left, and Kourtney Kardashian are fans of the form-fitting shapewear, which was founded back in 2000

Her secret weapon: Singer Adele even revealed that she wore Spanx under her dazzling black gown at the 2012 Grammy Awards

The undergarment, which can be worn without a bra, has also been designed with a cotton gusset with snaps for when nature calls and added back ruching aims to conceal any back fat.

However, looking good doesn't come cheap - the teddy, which is available online and at Harrods, will set you back £82.

Previously a red carpet secret, Spanx are now proudly worn by A-listers such as Kim and Kourtney Kardashian, Princess Beatrice, Jessica Alba and Beyonce.

Even tiny-waisted Rochelle from the Saturdays admitted to wearing them under her wedding dress last year.

Over 36,000 body-shapers are manufactured each day

To date, more than 5.4 million Spanx Power Panties have been sold worldwide – when Oprah announced she’d 'given up panties' and only wore Spanx, more than 20,000 pairs were sold that day alone

Founded in 2000, Spanx is headquartered in Atlanta

During the eight-hour manufacturing process of Spanx hosiery products, more than 40 women touch each pair

After kickstarting a shapewear revolution, the company now makes more than 200 figure-fixing products – from back-fat busting bras to bottom-boosting bodysuits
