Ronny Deila's former right-hand man has revealed how the new Celtic boss had talked himself into an instant promotion - moving from potential Parkhead backroom boy to No 1 contender for the top job.

Lifting the lid on a process that saw the relatively unknown Stromsgodset manager handed control of the Champions League hopefuls, David Nielsen said his close friend and confidant would have been willing to work under a more high-profile head coach like Roy Keane.

But Nielsen, former assistant and now interim successor to Deila, insisted that Celtic majority shareholder Dermot Desmond and chief executive Peter Lawwell had been completely won over in the space of a single interview - so much so that they put all their faith in a 38-year-old who has never worked outside of Norway.

‘He went in to interview for the assistant’s job and I think he would have taken it, because it’s such a big job,’ said Nielson.

‘But Ronny knew within his heart that he could do the top job. He went into the meeting and, when he came out, there was no more talk of him being an assistant manager.

‘He blew them away. The board knew that wasn’t an option – he was their man. That’s what happened.’

Deila is guaranteed a rousing send-off as he takes to the field for an emotional farewell at half-time during Monday’s home game against Kamper.

He’ll be back in Scotland by Tuesday, ready to start serious planning for Champions League qualifiers that could yet see his new team pitched against his former employers.

Nielsen said: ‘We were on the bus back from our away game last Wednesday night and Ronny and I turned in our seats, looked into each other’s eyes.

‘He said: “You know we’re going to end up on the touchline against each other going for the Champions League”. And we burst out laughing. I think it will happen – it’s destiny. It’s great for us.’

Meanwhile, John Collins has edged closer to becoming Deila’s new No 2 after weekend talks in Glasgow.

As Sportsmail revealed last week, the former Celtic, Hibs and Scotland midfielder is favourite to become the Norwegian’s right-hand man following a meeting described by sources as ‘positive and productive’.

However, Celtic chief executive Lawwell says the club are talking to ‘two or three’ candidates for the assistant’s post and Sportsmail understands Parkhead development coach John Kennedy is also firmly in the frame.

Collins has yet to discuss financial terms and no deal is concluded as yet.
