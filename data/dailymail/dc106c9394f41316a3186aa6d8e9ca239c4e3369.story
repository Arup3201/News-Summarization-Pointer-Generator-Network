A wife from hell who was given an Asbo for repeatedly shouting at her husband has been arrested for allegedly thumping her husband during a row, it has been revealed. 

Julie Griffiths, 45, has been taken to court on several occasions for launching loud rants at her other half, Norman - earning her the nickname 'nagsbo'.

Now it has been revealed that she was arrested for assaulting her 64-year-old husband - but after being hauled before court, the charge was dropped.

The Sun has reported this morning that neighbours say police have made a series of visits to the couple's home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, amid reports of bust-ups.

The newspaper quotes doorman James Clarke, 52, as saying: 'Police have been a few times. When she was arrested, we were all overjoyed.'  

Staffordshire Police confirmed in a statement that they were called to a 'domestic incident' in a street in Stoke-on-Trent.

A spokesman added: 'Julie Griffiths, 45, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of common assault.

'She was subsequently charged with assault by beating.'

The statement added that she was later bailed to appear before the North Staffordshire Domestic Violence Court, sitting at Newcastle Magistrates' Court earlier this month. 

A court official confirmed the case was discontinued. 

The couple are believed to be coming up to their 25th anniversary this weekend. 

Those living near their former home in Talke, Staffordshire celebrated last month after it emerged the couple were moving out after more than a decade living in their pink terraced house.

Mrs Griffiths was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting.

But earlier this year she was accused of breaching the order, landing her back in court. The case was later axed.

Neighbours of Mrs Griffiths were said to be 'popping champagne corks' when she left her former home.

Complaints had been made against her moaning since 1999, but it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo.

The ruling prohibited her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours.

Earlier this year she was fined for the noise she made when berating 64-year-old Mr Griffiths for buying the wrong type of scratch card.

This was before a third court appearance where she was accused laying into her partner's hygiene.

Friends say the couple have been married for more than 20 years but Griffiths' nagging only became an issue three years ago. She has reportedly been banned from numerous family events because of her tantrums.
