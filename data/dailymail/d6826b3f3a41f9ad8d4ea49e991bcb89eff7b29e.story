Criminal charges against a man whose homemade wristwatch triggered a full-on terror scare at a California airport last week will not be pressed prosecutors have announced.

The watch described having a toggle switch, fuses, and wires while running on a timer led to Geoffrey McGann's arrest on Thursday after he presented it to security at the Oakland International Airport.

The 49-year-old artist from outside Los Angeles, defended the unique timepiece as having been a harmless work of art.

Not a threat: Charges against a California man arrested for wearing this homemade wristwatch mistaken for a bomb will not be pursued according to prosecutors

Motive: Geoffrey McGann, who was arrested at the Oakland International Airport on Thursday, told officers he's an artist and the watch was a part of his art

McGann was instead charged of possessing materials to make an explosive device.

He was released on Saturday after posting $150,000 bail

'The watch had on it a toggle switch, a series of fuses, a series of wires protruding from it, a circuit board and the watch itself was on a direct timer,' Alameda County Sheriff's Sergeant J.D. Nelson said at the time of his arrest on Thursday.

TSA agents said they became suspicious of McGann when he tried to get the object through airport security by putting it in a bin covered by his jacked.

Sgt Nelson said that was just one of many irregularities which led officers to be disturbed by his demeanour and attire.

'He was wearing a military style shirt that has a built-in tourniquet in the sleeves,' he said.

McGannwas also wearing shoes two sizes too big and packed with layers of insoles - an eery similarity to the explosive device worn by the 2001 shoe bomber, Richard Reid.

Suspicious: TSA agents reported McGann placing the wrist watch in a security bin before suspiciously covering it with a jacket that revealed his military-style shirt with a built-in tourniquet in the sleeves

Eerie similarities: In addition to his suspicious watch McGann was found wearing shoes two-sizes too big that were stuffed with shoe insoles, much like the 2001 shoe bomber Richard Reid

Free to go: McGann, a managing creative director according to his Facebook profile, was released after posting $150,000 bail on Saturday

'They also had what appeared to be a homemade cavity in them and he was very evasive on everything that he was doing,'Â  Nelson said.

The official said the bomb squad arrived within five minutes and determined there were no explosive materials in the watch.

'Obviously he was missing a couple of things along the way,' Nelson admitted, while insisting police regarded the watch as a possible 'triggering device.'

According to McGann's Facebook page he is managing creative director of a media, marketing and advertising group, having studied visual communication design in college. He is also a father to a little girl.

Asked at the time if the sheriff's department had any idea of a possible motive for smuggling the device onboard, Nelson suggested it was possible McGann was testing out airport security systems in preparation for a full-blown attack at a later date.

'That's always a concern that someone is making a dry run,' he said.
