A mother has been arrested in Russia after she cut off her disabled daughter's head, telling police that she heard the voices of demons in her head telling her to do it.

Nadejda Voronova, 33, is being held in a secure psychiatric ward for tests following the grisly discovery of the headless corpse of a seven-year-old girl in the city of Yekaterinburg.

The single mother had been looking after her young daughter Yana - who suffered from cerebral palsy - alone since she divorced her husband four years ago.

According to neighbours, she had been struggling to get by without him, and had taken it badly when her mother had died at the start of the month, leaving her without any support in caring for Yana.

One neighbour told local TV: 'She looked worse every day but she didn't ask anyone to help, we thought she was managing.'

Police were called to the woman's apartment when they got an anonymous tip-off that she had killed her daughter, and turned up to check on the child's welfare. 

Voronova, who was sitting in the front room, told them she had killed her daughter after hearing voices she believed to be demons who had told her to do it.
