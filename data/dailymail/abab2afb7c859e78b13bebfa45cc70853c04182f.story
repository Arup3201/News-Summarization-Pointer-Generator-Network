A father of two has been charged with murdering his American-born beautician wife at their home.

Janee Parsons, 31, died of multiple stab wounds at the detached house in Bicester and her husband Andrew, 38, will today appear at Oxford Magistrates Court, according to Thames Valley Police.

Mrs Parsons was found by police after they were called to her home on Saturday. Officers and paramedics tried to resuscitate her, but she was declared dead at hospital.

Violence: American-born Mrs Parsons was stabbed to death at the family home in Bicester, Oxfordshire on Saturday after police were called by neighbours heard chilling screams and dialled 999

Detective Chief Inspector Joe Kidman,
 who is leading the investigation, said: 'We are keen to speak with 
anyone who may have important information to help us establish the 
circumstances of this tragic incident.'

Detectives were last night given 
extra time to question Parsons, after he was found in their rented house
 with his severely injured wife after neighbours heard chilling screams and dialled 999.

The couple’s sons, aged eight and five, were not in the house at the time their mother was 
killed, although police would not confirm where the children were.

A post mortem examination by a Home Office pathologist revealed she had died from multiple stab wounds.

Mrs Parsons’s father and sister were flying 
to the UK from her childhood home in Oklahoma, USA. They were expected 
to arrive later today.

The pair had lived in the £300,000 rented house in Bicester in Oxfordshire, for around 18 months.

As lessons at nearby Bure Park Primary
 School finished for the day, young friends of the couple's sons 
walked up to the house and left tributes to Mrs Parsons.

They added teddy bears holding hearts,
 flowers and handmade cards to the pile of bouquets placed outside by 
police on behalf of grieving friends and neighbours.

Police tape hung across the alleyway leading to the three-bedroom family home, with uniformed police officers standing guard.

Officers dressed 
head-to-toe in forensic examination suits were going to and from the 
home with bags of evidence.

The normally quiet road had several liveried Thames Valley Police vehicles parked near the house.

Shocked neighbour Andrea Duggan, 69, said: 'It’s such a horrendous thing to happen to a young family.

'You just can’t imagine what those two little boys are going through and you can only pray that they’ll be okay.

'It must be awful for their relatives too, being so far away in the US. It must be like a nightmare.

'I haven’t lived here long but it’s quite a close community. I think everyone is a bit shaken up by it, and a bit nervous.'

Many of the heartrending notes left at the house made reference to the boys, who attended the nearby school.

Make-up artist: The couple are believed to have moved to Britain from the US after Mrs Parsons sold her health spa business in Oklahoma when it ran into financial difficulty

The are both in the care of social 
services and will be interviewed by specially trained officers about the
 weeks leading up to their mother’s death.

The two sons were taken away by police and will be cared for by the victim’s father 
and sister.

Neighbours said the family were under financial pressure and had recently set up two businesses in a bid to raise money.

One said: ‘My children are friends with the kids and they feel like they want to help but they just can’t.’ 

The victim’s sister, Jocelyn Brady, said her family, who live in Yukon, Oklahoma, have been devastated by her death.

Boarding
 a plane to London, she said: ‘Everybody loved Janee. She was a very 
special person and very tenacious and she was my best friend.’

Police
 were called to the Parsons’ home on 
Saturday at 10.30am after neighbours reported hearing a heated argument 
and screams.

Witnesses described half a dozen 
emergency services vehicles descending on the street. Paramedics 
discovered Mrs Parsons with fatal stab wounds, and despite desperate 
attempts to save her life she died at the scene.

Tribute: One of many cards left outside the house by friends, neighbours and classmates of Mrs Parsons' sons

Last night neighbours left floral 
tributes outside the house.

One
 said: ‘To my wonderful friend Janee, you were taken away from us and 
you are now looking down on us. I will never understand why?’

Another added: ‘Your boys will grow up knowing you’ll be watching over them, guiding them in every way, every day.’

The
 couple are believed to have moved to Britain from the US after Mrs 
Parsons sold her health spa business in Oklahoma when it ran into 
financial difficulty.

Parsons, who has also worked as a fencer and builder, graduated from 
Bicester Community College in 1990. His mother Jean lives a short 
distance away.

Companies 
House records show he set up a heat pumps firm in October and his wife 
set up a company, called Wink Ink Ltd, two months earlier.

Mrs Parsons, a make-up artist and skin
 expert, worked for a series of cosmetic companies and at a Bicester 
beauty clinic. She specialised in make-up for professional modelling 
shoots and wedding days in the US and Britain.

'Great gift from God': Mother Mary Brady said Mrs Parsons was a 'wonderful mother' and a 'tireless worker'

The couple’s two sons, who enjoy rugby and martial arts, attend a nearby primary school.

Neighbours
 described Mr Parsons as a ‘quiet, normal man’. Next-door neighbour Alan
 Parsons, 64, said: ‘They were always a very pleasant family and it’s 
very shocking that something like this could happen.’

Maria Evans added: ‘It is incredibly upsetting. It is such a quiet neighbourhood and the thoughts have to be with the children.

'It is such a huge shock to hear something like this has happened, absolutely devastating.’

Another neighbour, who arrived with a 
bouquet of flowers, said: ‘It’s a massive shock for everybody. We’re all
 quite a close-knit community, especially the mums.’
