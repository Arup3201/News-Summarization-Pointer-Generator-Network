A doctor wrongly told three patients they had the all-clear from breast cancer after they underwent tests.

A total of 462 male and female patients had a series of examinations before being told they were given the all clear.

It was only when two consultants spotted that a doctor was not screening patients correctly that the mistakes were realised.

The Royal Bournemouth Hospital had to send letters to 462 people asking them to be re-examined

The Royal Bournemouth Hospital had to send patients who were examined between January 2011 and July 2012 letters telling them they needed to undergo tests again.

After being re-examined a 63-year-old man was diagnosed with the disease and two women had already been told they had cancer and were being treated at a different hospital.

The doctor no longer works at the hospital.

Consultants who run the breast clinic raised concerns regarding a doctor

A hospital spokesman: 'Earlier this year the Trust invited back a number of patients who attended the breast clinic at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital between January 2011 and July 2012.

'This was because the consultants who run the breast clinic raised concerns regarding a doctor, who is no longer working in the Trust.

'We carried out a careful review of the management of the patients who were seen by this doctor and invited 462 patients back for a clinical appointment with a consultant.

'Of those invited back, one has been diagnosed with breast cancer.

'Two other patients had been treated for breast cancer at other hospitals in the interval period between when they were originally seen by the doctor, and when they were invited back.

'We apologise to all patients involved for the distress this has caused.

'The review team worked extremely hard to ensure all patients invited back did receive the invite letter.

'Copies of the letters were sent to the patientâ€™s GPs and new addresses were found for those who did not respond with offers of appointments closer to where they now live.

'A helpline was set up for patients and extra clinics put on for those patients who could not make the earlier appointments.

'Some patients chose not to attend after discussions with clinical staff and for individual reasons a few patients are still coming in for appointments.

'The Board will continue to look closely at this case and we have invited the Royal College of Surgeons in to review what happened.'
