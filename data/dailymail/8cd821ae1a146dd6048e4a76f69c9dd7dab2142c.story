Britain has been named as the gout capital of Europe with one in 40 people suffering the condition which commonly causes swelling and pain to the big toe

Our love of alcohol and reliance on junk food has made Britain into the country worst affected by gout in Europe, researchers claim.

A record one in 40 people in the UK have been diagnosed with the painful arthritic disorder that famously afflicted Henry VIII – bringing the total number of patients with the condition to around 1.5million.

Historically known as ‘the disease of kings’, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle.

A new study, published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, suggests 21st century diets are fuelling a surge in cases, with the UK ahead of Germany and Italy.

However two-thirds of sufferers are still not being prescribed drugs for the condition – a statistic that has remained unchanged since the late 1990s, according to scientists.

Lead researcher Dr Weiya Zhang, from Nottingham City Hospital, said ‘We are eating too much junk food.

'We are also drinking a lot of alcohol. All these things cause gout.

‘The prevalence of gout has risen in the past 16 years and is now the highest reported within Europe.’

‘But it is curable, with the right drugs, and that is also something we are not doing very well at because gout is extremely painful if left untreated.

Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis, with sudden onset of acute pain, redness and swelling in peripheral joints, most commonly the joint in the big toe.

It is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which is related to high uric acid in the blood, and can be alleviated with urate-lowering treatment (ULT).

The condition used to be rare among young people, but research suggests it is becoming more common with the obese getting it a decade earlier than healthy weight people.

'Despite being the commonest inflammatory arthritis the management of gout continues unchanged with just a minority of patients receiving ULT and new patients not being treated in a timely fashion,' Dr Zhang added.

The study found wide variation in both the number of existing and new cases with the most occurring in Wales and the North East of England.

Analysis of primary care records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) between 1997 and 2012 found among more than 4.5 million eligible people almost 116,000 already had gout.

This is a prevalence of 2.5 per cent,
 almost twice as high as previous estimates and topping Germany (1.4 per
 cent) and Italy (around one per cent).

Men
 were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed than women, 
mostly between the ages of 35 and 39 at a ratio of 11 to two.

More than 7,000 new cases were identified giving an overall incidence of 2.26 per 1,000 person years, rising to 3.5 among men. They were highest for both sexes among those aged 80 to 84.

During the study period the prevalence of gout rose by 64 per cent, increasing by around 4 per cent every year. Rates were around four times higher in men.

The number of new cases rose by 30 per cent during this time, increasing by around 1.5 per cent each year.

New cases were highest in Wales and the North East of England, and lowest in the East of England and Northern Ireland.

Only a third of people with gout were getting urate-lowering drugs, a proportion that remained constant over 15 years, says a report online in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (must credit).

In 2012, fewer than one in five patients was prescribed drugs within six months of their diagnosis, and only around one in four was still on treatment a year later.

This rate was virtually unchanged since 1997, despite the publication of guidelines on optimal management of the condition.

Patients got better at taking their drugs, with around four out of 10 doing so in 2012, compared with 28 per cent in 1997, but these figures suggests more needs to be done, said Dr Zhang.

‘It is apparent educational initiatives to improve practitioner knowledge, interest and standard of care of the only ‘curable’ form of inflammatory arthritis are urgently required’ he added.

Rheumatologist Dr Tim Tait, medical trustee of the UK Gout Society said ‘We welcome this new data which reaffirms gout as a significant health problem.

‘The increase in gout is a result of a combination of factors - primarily an ageing population and a growing obesity problem in the UK.’

Researchers last month found gout may run in the family, partly because of genetics and also through sharing similar diets.
