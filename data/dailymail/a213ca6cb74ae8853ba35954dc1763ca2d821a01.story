Speech: Sir Winston Churchill used the phrase in 1952

It is not every day that George Osborne is described as being Churchillian.

But the Chancellor’s insistence that ‘We are all in this together’ when talking about the spending cuts echoes a phrase used by Sir Winston Churchill at a private dinner more than 50 years ago.

The wartime Prime Minister said ‘We’re all in it together’ in  a speech to tax collectors and former Chancellors of the Exchequer about the economic and political threats facing Britain in the 1950s.

Until now historians had no idea that Churchill had ever made the remark.

But a sound recording of the speech, which was made on May 28, 1952, has been found among the politician’s private record collection – currently being digitised by experts at the Churchill Archive at the University of Cambridge.

The recording, which was played for the first time on BBC Radio 4 programme Churchill’s Secret Cabinet last night, is one of several Churchill had privately commissioned for his own benefit.

In many instances they are the only surviving public record of his attendance at private events.

Historian and Churchill biographer Andrew Roberts said: ‘Both George Osborne and David Cameron have used a near identical phrase and they are being Churchillian without actually realising it.

‘Of course they were both unaware that Churchill had  ever said it.’

Churchill, who kept his record collection in a mahogany cabinet in the dining room of his Chartwell home, shared his concerns about Britain’s future  at a Jubilee dinner organised by the National Association of Her Majesty’s Inspector of Taxes.

Favourite phrase: Chancellor George Osborne is being unwittingly Churchillian every time he uses his mantra

He said: ‘I feel a great burden upon me at my age having seen so much and been through so much.

‘Not that I cannot bear it in the ordinary physical sense but I do see great perils hanging over the country. We have all got to fight together for the life of the nation...Our feeling is to some extent alleviated by the fact that we’re all in it together.’ Experts say the fact the Prime Minister was so open about his feelings might mean the speech was impromptu.

Churchill becomes more light-hearted as the speech progresses, paying tribute to members of the audience.

He says the country owes them a debt of gratitude and thanks them for their help ‘in extracting more and more money from those who guilelessly voted us into office’.

Nearly identical: David Cameron is also famous for using the phrase in this time of austerity

He jokes about his last visit to the association some 25 years earlier, when he was ‘only’ Chancellor of the Exchequer and Second Lord of the Treasury, compared with his new positions as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury. Mr Roberts said it was ‘extraordinary’ to learn new things about Churchill, who died in 1965.

The record collection also includes a previously unheard recording of a speech Churchill made to RAF personnel at Biggin Hill in 1951.

He recalls how he crashed while taking flying lessons in the years leading up to the First World War.

He says that his dinner companion on that night thought he looked like ‘a ghost’, before telling the officers: ‘I suspect you’ve had many more exciting adventures than that.’

There is also a recording of Churchill explaining to the French people his decision to sink the country’s fleet in July 1940 in a bid to stop it falling into enemy hands. He speaks in the schoolboy French he learnt at Harrow.

Mr Roberts believes that Churchill kept recordings of his speeches so he could study them to improve his technique.

But the collection also includes a number of musical and comedy works, including Noel Coward’s Don’t Let’s Be Beastly To The Germans as well as songs by music hall acts.

Experts at the Churchill Archive are racing against time to digitise the recordings, which are in a poor state and on the verge of collapse.
