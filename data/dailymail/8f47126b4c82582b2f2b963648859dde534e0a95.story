A six-feet tall, 310-pound student  is facing criminal charges after he broke into a party and stole Chinese food while dressed as a yellow Teletubby. 

Terez Owens, a student from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was dressed as the Laa-Laa from the BBC children's series when he went into the  refrigerator and dumped leftovers into a 'man purse' before leaving.

While trying to steal the food, he spilled sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken onto the floor. He also cut himself and left parts of the property covered in blood.

On the way into the party, the former football player also damaged a door, according to reports. 

Before the incident, 20-year-old Owens posted a photo to his Instagram saying, 'what's a n**** gotta do for some general tso' which has since been deleted.

Initially Owens was not going to face criminal responsibility.

However the occupants changed their mind when their landlord became involved in the incident.

Bethlehem police Chief Mark DiLuzio told The Express Times: 'I guess the victims thought about it and the landlord got involved with the damage.'

He added: 'Not that many Teletubbies get arrested. You can't make it up.'

Owens, an undergraduate business/supply chain management major, declined to comment Wednesday night.

DiLuzio says a disorderly conduct and criminal mischief summons will be sent to the 20-year-old.
