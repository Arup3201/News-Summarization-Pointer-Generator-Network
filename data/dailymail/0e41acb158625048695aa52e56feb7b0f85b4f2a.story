Emily Baker has won a Penguin publishing deal after writing a piece of One Direction fan fiction

EL James paved the way for adult writers of fan fiction, proving (with Fifty Shades Of Grey) that posting your stories online is an excellent way to secure a publishing deal.

And now one teenage pop music fan from North Lincolnshire has done the same for young adult writers.

One Direction super-fan Emily Baker, 16, has won a coveted deal with Penguin publishing group after writing a fictional love story inspired by her favourite boy band and posting it online.

Loving The Band, which Emily wrote while 
studying for her GCSEs, details an imagined relationship with a band 
based on the boys in 1D.

The short story quickly became the post 
popular piece of fiction on youth writing community website Movellas.

And 30,000 of Emily's avid online readers begged her to write another 
installment.

Meanwhile, Penguin's Razorbill imprint had been looking to commission a writer to pen a
romantic young adult fictional novel that tapped into the market's current obsession with
boy bands.

Senior Fiction Editor, Lindsey Heaven, 
was browsing the site when she came across Emily's story, and felt the 
teenager was 'just the right kind of new talent to 
write such a novel with powerful emotion and authority'.

The publishers immediately acquired world rights from Movellas, who have since removed the story.

She was commissioned by Penguin to update the story for publication.

Speaking to MailOnline during her college
lunch break, Emily explained how she felt upon receiving the news 
from Penguin.

'I couldn't really believe it, and it still hasn't sunk in!

'The story is a typical girl-meets-boy love story, except it's girl-meets-band.

'It's about a girl who lives in Scotland and comes down to London to visit her best friend.

'When she gets there she bumps into a boy band and hangs out with them, and eventually she finds out two of them - Shaq and Reily - have fallen for her.

'After Penguin commissioned me we worked together to change quite a lot of it and turn it into a new book.

'And if you want to know what happens next you'll have to wait and read the book!'

Though the names of the band and its members have been changed, Emily admits Loving The Band is based on One Direction, her favourite pop act.

But when it comes to her favourite member, she can't decide between Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson.

'I don't really have a favourite One Direction boy. I like them all,' she confessed. 'I've still never seen them live because the tickets always sell out so fast.

'I'd really love them to read my book when it comes out, though! That would be nice.'

Lindsey Heaven said: 'We at Penguin Children's are delighted to be 
publishing Loving the Band.

'Emily's novel is fresh, romantic, current 
and completely taps into today's pop culture.

'Her love of a certain boy 
band is heartfelt, and her passion feeds into every bit of her writing.

'We were incredibly excited to discover Emily's writing originally on the
teen writers' site movellas.com where she had amassed the most 
incredible fan-base already. I'm sure they will be thrilled to see her 
published too!'

Emily added: 'I wrote my original novel on 
Movellas at the time that I was taking my GCSEs, so I had to balance my 
studies with writing.

It was hard work, but it all paid off when 
everybody on Movellas was so supportive of what I was doing, which just 
urged me to continue writing chapter after chapter.

'I am very excited to be 
published by Penguin and it also helps that everyone there is so 
lovely!'

Loving the Band will be published in ebook form on 1 November.
