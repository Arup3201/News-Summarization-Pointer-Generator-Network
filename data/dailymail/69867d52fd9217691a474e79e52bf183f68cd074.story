A young mother 'died from deep vein thrombosis' three weeks after she gave birth through an emergency caesarean, an inquest heard.

Maxine Nour, 24, from Hanwell, west London, gave birth on August 16, 2011 but complained to her husband of shortness of breath and chest pains after she left hospital - saying she was too tired to even get out of bed, the hearing was told.

She passed out on August 29 while a community midwife was visiting the family at their home in Hanwell, west London.

Her husband, Zaki Nour, told West London Coroners' Court how she was taken to Ealing Hospital where she told staff how tired she was and was advised by nurses to rest - moments before collapsing again.

Maxine Nour, 24, from Hanwell, west London, gave birth in August 2011 but complained to her husband of shortness of breath and chest pains. She was taken to Ealing Hospital following a collapse

However, the DVT was not spotted and she was sent home following more tests, the inquest was told.

Although she had been given an electrocardiagram (ECG) by paramedics, which showed tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat which can be linked to a caesarean - before she was taken to the hospital, her doctor said she was never told about the condition.

Dr Joanna Cook said she was not told about the results of the ECG carried out by the paramedics - which she admitted at the inquest were abnormal.

She added if she had been told of the suggestion of tachycardia she would have asked for another ECG to be done at the hospital.

She said: 'Mrs Nour spoke normally without shortness of breath.

'I didn't request an ECG because I didn't hear of any symptoms.

Mrs Nour was found to have tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat - by paramedics but a doctor at the hospital says she was not made aware of it

'The observations (about the patient) were on a paper towel when I first assessed her as the notes hadn't been made up yet. The tachycardia was not on the paper towel.'

But the tachycardia had no bearing on her death, according to experts.

It was as Mrs Nour was leaving hospital that she collapsed for a second time. Mr Nour said: 'She was told to go to the desk to be discharged and she was walking really slowly there.

'She asked or a chair and she collapsed again and was taken back to the room, where she had some food and drink and rest and was sent home.

'Over the next few days, she was the same - really tired and had problems breathing.'

He said his wife had told ambulance staff on an earlier occasion she was suffering chest pains.

He said: 'She told the ambulance she always has chest pains.'

A post-mortem examination showed the DVT had started in her pelvis and spread to her lungs in the space of around a week.

She had not complained of pain in her legs prior to her death, which is a key symptom of DVT.

Community midwife Grace Lee said she saw Mr Nour on the 21st and he did not express any concerns about his wife's health. She said she had no notes of her complaining about chest pain of shortness of breath.

Paramedics called to the house on August 29th did not record any mention of chest pains or shortness of breath either - claiming Mrs Nour simply did not tell them.

Expert witness, Mr Luca Fusi, said: 'Even if the massive embolism had been spotted on August 29th, it might not have helped Mrs Nour.'

Coroner Lorna Tagliavini adjourned the inquest until Friday.
