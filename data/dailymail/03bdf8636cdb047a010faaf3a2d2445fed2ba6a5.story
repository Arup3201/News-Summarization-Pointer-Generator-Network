She was rushed to hospital on Friday morning after what was first suspected as an overdose but later diagnosed as 'exhaustion and dehydration'.

And during her absence concerns were quickly raised about the safety of Brooke Mueller and  ex-husband Charlie Sheen's three-year old twin sons, Bob and Max.

It has now been reported that the toddlers were in the care of Mueller's live-in nanny during her hospital dash.

Sources tell TMZ that the caretaker looked after the tots during the former real estate agent's absence.

The boys stayed at Mueller's house with the nanny, who has lived in the household for several years, and did not go to their father Sheen's house nor were put under the care of the actor's other ex-wife Denise Richards, who has looked after them in the past.

Brooke was rushed to hospital on Friday morning after what was first thought to be an overdose.

The previous evening she was seen looking glassy-eyed as she stepped out of a car upon her arrival for dinner at Mr Chow.

However, the troubled ex-wife of Charlie Sheen's publicist has spoken out to claim that no drugs were involved.

Instead, Steve Honig said in a statement that Brooke was mistakenly believed to be unresponsive while sleeping telling MailOnline: 'An assistant thought Brooke was non-responsive while she was napping and hastily called an ambulance.

'As a precaution, Brooke was brought 
to a local hospital and discharged after an hour. She was diagnosed with
exhaustion and dehydration and is now fine and resting at home. That's 
it.'

The 35-year-old, who has a long history of drug abuse, was taken to a Los Angeles hospital in the late morning, according to TMZ.

But in a video posted on the website today Brooke was seen leaving the hospital after being discharged with blackened hands , leading to speculation that she had been using crack cocaine and burnt herself.

But the socialite claimed that her hands were in fact covered in spray paint from an art project.

The troubled mother-of two also blamed her exhaustion on a line of jewelry making she’s been making for her new boyfriend jeweller Pascal Mouawad with whom she was having dinner at Mr Chow's the night before the incident.

'See? Look,' she said, clutching a wad of trinkets with mysteriously blackened fingertips. 'Jewelry. Everywhere is jewelry.'

Resting: According to her publicist Brooke was diagnosed with exhaustion and dehydration and is now resting at home

The website reports that the Los Angeles City Fire Department informed them that Brooke was transported to the hospital from her Tarzana home at 11.42am.

Sources reportedly told the website that people around Brooke are 'deeply concerned' and alleged that she had been taking drugs for several weeks, it was claimed.

But Brooke is so determined to prove she was not on drugs, she told Radar Online: 'I am going back to the hospital to get the test results that will prove that I wasn't on drugs.'

For her meal out on Thursday night, Brooke went for a boho look, sporting a jewelled headband and a leather jacket, trousers and studded boots.

Brooke was placed on probation for one year after she plead guilty to possession of cocaine on March 19.

The Witchouse actress and mother-of-two has been in rehab multiple times.

Brooke married Charlie Sheen in May 2008 and gave birth to their twin sons Bob and Max nine months later.

Charlie filed for divorce from Brooke in November 2010, and the pair's divorce became effective the following June.
