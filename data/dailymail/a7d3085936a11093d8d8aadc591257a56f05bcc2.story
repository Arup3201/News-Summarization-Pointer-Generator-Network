The Dalai Lama has said he should be the last Tibetan spiritual leader, as a weak successor would only disgrace the position.

He told a German newspaper that the centuries-old religious tradition should finish with a 'popular' Dalai Lama.

He has previously said that 'the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose'.

In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper he said: 'We had a Dalai Lama for almost five centuries.

'The 14th Dalai Lama now is very popular. Let us then finish with a popular Dalai Lama.'

'If a weak Dalai Lama comes along, then it will just disgrace the Dalai Lama,' he added with a laugh, according to a transcript of the English language interview.

He also said: 'Tibetan Buddhism is not dependent on one individual. We have a very good organisational structure with highly trained monks and scholars.'

China has governed Tibet since 1951, a year after invading, and the Dalai Lama fled across the Himalayas to India after a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.

The Dalai Lama and his 13 predecessors have wielded political and religious power over Tibetans for hundreds of years. Each dead Dalai Lama has been thought to be reincarnated in the body of a male child.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2011 retired from political duties and has upgraded the role of prime minister of the Tibetan exile community.

Though he remains the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, his decision to abdicate as political leader was one of the biggest upheavals for the community since a Chinese crackdown led him to flee Tibet in 1959 into exile in India.

But he is still the most powerful rallying point for Tibetans, both in exile and in their homeland, and remains the universally recognised face of the movement.

Asked by the German newspaper how much longer he may carry on his advocacy duties, the 79-year-old said: 'The doctors say I could become 100 years old. But in my dreams I will die at the age of 113 years.

'I hope and pray that I may return to this world as long as sentient beings' suffering remains. I mean not in the same body, but with the same spirit and the same soul.'

On the question of whether he may ever be able to return to Tibet, he said: 'Yes, I am sure of that. China can no longer isolate itself, it must follow the global trend towards a democratic society.'
