A former Royal Navy officer has become the 10,000th person to receive government help to start their business after banks refused to help.

David Cameron today revealed Iraq and Afghanistan veteran Allen Martin will receive £10,000 towards launching his own business, just months after leaving the forces.

The Prime Minister said he was determined to make money available to people with business ideas but who ‘through no fault of their own they can’t get the money to make a go of it’.

Ex-Royal Navy officer Allen Martin is the latest to receive a Start-Up Loan, launched after ministers became frustrated with high street banks refusing to take risks.

After being medically discharged from the forces, Mr Allen plans to launch a property management firm in Cornwall

The state-backed Start-up Loans initiative has now lent £50 million to entrepreneurs across the country, and has a target to help 30,000 new businesses with £151 million by 2015.

It was launched after ministers became frustrated with high street banks refusing to take risks with entrepreneurs wanting to go it alone.

Mr Martin is one of the first ex-forces personnel to benefit from the scheme, after ministers agreed to lift the age limit which meant only people aged 18 to 30 could apply.

After two decades in the Navy, rising to Petty Officer, he was injured in an accident re-fuelling an aircraft and was left with chronic seborrheic dermatitis which led to a reaction with dealing with fuels and oils.

Mr Marting told MailOnline: ‘I had a medical discharge so I had a short space of time to get from the military into Civilian Street.

‘I found a company called X-Forces. They helped me deal with the transition. It is a lot easier for us from the forces to get on the business ladder now.’

After finding out that his military career was over, he says he needed to find a ‘game plan’ and ‘knew in my heart that I wanted to be my own boss’.

He plans to launch Eclipse Property, a property management company in Truro where he lives with his Gayle and three children, Lauren 15, Harrison 7 and Aston 3.

‘I have spent the last two or three months planning, getting things in place. We should be ready to go in January,’ he added.

He plans to use the money to set up an office and launch an advertising campaign online and through billboards to establish a foothold in a competitive market.

In addition to the repayable loan, the scheme also offers a business mentor for entrepreneurs across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Ministers argue that the scheme has a positive economic benefit, even allowing for some of the businesses to fail.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Start-Up Loans are helping budding entrepreneurs across our country achieve their dreams - people who have got ideas, determination and costed business plans but through no fault of their own they can’t get the money to make a go of it.

‘New businesses are the lifeblood of a healthy, expanding economy: a symbol of aspiration and a source of jobs, that’s why Start-Up Loans matter to me - and it’s why they’re a key part of my plan for Britain.’

Mr Martin had just a few weeks to adjust to life out of uniform as he planned what he would do in Civvy Street

The businesses get help drawing up a business plan and preparing a pitch for the money, and after securing funding will be offered advice by mentors for several months.

Business Secretary Vince Cable admitted that not all of the businesses would succeed, but it was better than people living on out-of-work benefits.

He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘Of course what we’re talking about here, about a third of the people on the scheme haven’t got a job, they would be unemployed otherwise, but they’re trying their hand at business.

‘They’re properly vetted, there are professional people vetting them, they’re given mentoring, they’re given advice, they’ve got every opportunity to launch a successful business.

‘But business is competitive, it’s risky, that’s the nature of it and some of our most successful businesspeople failed before they succeeded, so not all of them are going to succeed.’

‘The banks have walked away from high-risk lending, it’s one of the consequences of the banking crisis.

‘The people we’re talking about here, who get these start-up loans don’t have any collateral, they don’t have any property to offer as security, so the banks won’t go anywhere near them.’
