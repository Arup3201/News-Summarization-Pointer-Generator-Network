An 81-year-old Michigan man met his son for the first time on Sunday.

Tony Trapani of Grand Rapids was cleaning out some filing cabinets following the death of his wife when he discovered a letter written over 50 years by a woman revealing that she had given birth to a son, and he was the father.

That son, Samuel Childress, who was just five-years-old when the letter was written, is now 61.

As for why his wife would intercept and hide the letter for all these years, Trapani points out the difficulties the couple faced trying to have children of their own.

'She wanted children,' said Trapani of his late wife in an interview with Fox 17. 

'She couldn’t have any. She tried and tried.'

That being said, Trapani still seems to resent her decision, no matter what her motivation may have been, saying; 'He’s my full son that I’ve had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me.'

The reunion was just as poignant for Childress, who long ago resigned himself to the fact that he had been abandoned by his father. 

'Just to know him now is so important to me. It’s going to fill that void,' said the man, who spent his youth in Pennsylvania.

As for the letter, written in 1959, it began; 'I have a little boy. He is five years old now. What I’m trying to say Tony is he is your son. He was born November 14th, 1953.'

When he never responded, Childress' mother simply assumed the man wanted nothing to do with the boy, and informed the child of his decision.

'I always asked my mom, I said, "Well what does he look like?"' says Childress. 

'She said, "Well, go look in the mirror."'

And while the two men are enjoying their time together, and all the catching up they have to do, they are still planning a paternity test just to make certain this news is not too good to be true.
