A statue honouring Penn State football head coach Joe Paterno has been torn down as the university bows to massive public outcry.

Penn State ordered the removal of the statue of Hall of Fame coach early on Sunday morning.

Workers lifted the statue off its base and used a forklift to move it into Beaver Stadium early Sunday as the 100 to 150 students watching chanted, 'We are Penn State.'

Gone: The site outside Beaver Stadium where Joe Paterno's statue once stood has been stripped of all monuments after workers uprooted the statue honouring the late coach

Farewell: Workers are seen carting away the covered statue of ex-Penn State football coach Joe Paterno on Sunday morning

Coming down: Police and construction workers have surrounded the Joe Paterno statue in State College, Pennsylvania as Penn State prepares to remove it

The university announced that it was 
going to take down the monument in the wake of an investigative report 
that found the late coach and three other top Penn State administrators 
concealed sex abuse claims against retired assistant coach Jerry 
Sandusky.

Paterno, who coached the team for nearly
50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year at the height of the case

The statue turned into a target for Paterno’s critics after former FBI Director Louis Freeh alleged a cover-up by Paterno and others that allowed Sandusky to continue molesting boys.

Police and construction workers barricaded both sides of the street and the sidewalks near the statue.

Before and after: Workers gutted the location of the Paterno statue outside Beaver Stadium on Sunday morning

Removal: The Paterno statue was surrounded by a fence and a tarp before it was taken down by construction workers on Sunday

A chain-link fence was also erected around the area and a tarp was raised that concealed most of the statue.

In a statement released later on Sunday morning, the Paterno family said: 'Tearing down the statue of Joe Paterno does not serve the victims of Jerry Sandusky's horrible crimes or help heal the Penn State Community. We believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth.'

The family also chided the media for what they called one-sided reporting on a document that Paterno is unable to defend himself against.

The Freeh report, though it has been 
accepted by the media as the definitive conclusion on the Sandusky 
scandal, is the equivalent of an indictment - a charging document 
written by a prosecutor - and an incomplete and unofficial one at that.

'To those who truly want to know the truth about Sandusky, it should matter that Joe Paterno has never had a hearing; that his legal counsel has never been able to interview key witnesses, all of whom are represented by lawyers and therefore unavailable; that there has never been an opportunity to review critical evidence which has not been made public; that selective evidence and the opinion of Mr Freeh is treated as the equivalent of a fair trial.'

The statement went on: 'Despite this obviously flawed and one-sided presentation, the University believes it must acquiesce and accept that Joe Paterno has been given a fair and complete hearing. We think the better course would have been for the University to take a strong stand in support of due process so that the complete truth can be uncovered.'

Construction vehicles and police arrived shortly after dawn Sunday, barricading the street and sidewalks near the statue, erecting a chain-link fence then concealing the statue with a blue tarp.

Penn State President Rod Erickson 
said he decided to have the statue removed and put into storage because 
it 'has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing.'

'I
believe that, were it to remain, the statue will be a recurring wound 
to the multitude of individuals across the nation and beyond who have 
been the victims of child abuse,' Erickson said in a statement released 
at 7am on Sunday.

Reaction: Some students and State College residents could not contain their emotions as they saw Beaver Stadium without the statue

Down and out: Penn State President Rod Erickson said he decided to have the statue removed and put into storage because it 'has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing'

He said Paterno's name will remain on the campus library because it 'symbolizes the substantial and lasting contributions to the academic life and educational excellence that the Paterno family has made to Penn State University.'

Last week, a plane was spotted over State College towing a banner that read 'TAKE THE STATUE DOWN OR WE WILL.'

Also last week, the group that runs the 
parking area 
dubbed 'Paternoville,' where students camp out for tickets before games,
stripped that title and changed the name to 'Nittanyville.'

Demands: The banner referred to a monument to Paterno, who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year

The Penn State student group that 
manages the newly-renamed fan area said that their decision would help 'return the focus to the overall team and the thousands of students who 
support it.'

But that may soon be a moot point, as the NCAA has said it isn't ruling out the possibility of shutting down 
the entire Penn State football programme in light of the Sandusky case.

The NCAA will announce a punishment against Penn State and its football programme tomorrow morning.

A source told CBS News that the penalties against the university will be 'unprecedented.'

Getting rid of all traces: Since a scathing report which detailed how much former football coach Joe Paterno (pictured) knew about the child sex scandal, his name is being pulled from much of the school

The bronze sculpture outside Beaver Stadium has been a rallying point for students and alumni outraged over Paterno's firing four days after Sandusky's November 5 arrest - and grief-stricken over the Hall of Fame coach's Jan. 22 death at age 85.

But it turned into a target for critics after the Freeh report's stunning allegation of a cover-up by Paterno, ousted President Graham Spanier and two Penn State officials, Athletic Director Tim Curley and Vice President Gary Schultz.

Their failure to report Sandusky to child-welfare authorities in 2001 allowed him to continue molesting boys, the report found.

The statue has been sitting in front of the stadium since 2001.
