A thug who was caught on camera holding his dog in the air as he throttled it has been spared jail.

Bradley Robertson, 27, of Tilbury, Essex, was investigated after shocking CCTV footage emerged of him suspending his Yorkshire terrier Scamp - who has since been rehomed - in the air by its neck.

Robertson was then seen beating the dog over its head. He said he had been holding Scamp in the air in a bid to stop him urinating in the lift, which he claimed the dog had done on other occasions.

Robertson appeared at Basildon Magistrates’ Court where he was banned from keeping animals for five years. He was also ordered to complete 80 hours of unpaid work and pay £560 costs.

He was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to his dog at an earlier hearing. The RSPCA began investigating last October after concerns were raised about how Scamp was being treated.

Officers were sickened when they viewed CCTV from the block of flats where Robertson lives. He could be seen inside one of the lifts holding Scamp up by the neck and beating him.

Speaking after the sentencing, Lewis Taylor, an RSPCA inspector, said: ‘The footage shows this terrier being strung by his neck on the lead and then hit in a callously casual way.'

Mr Taylor added: ‘Poor Scamp would have been in a lot of pain.

'Poor Scamp would have been in a lot of pain. There is just no excuse for treating a defenceless animal'

'There is just no excuse for treating a defenceless animal, and one which he was responsible for, with such a complete lack of care and I am very pleased he has been given a ban. Hopefully this will protect other animals from a similar fate.’

Roberson voluntarily handed Scamp and his other dog, a two-year-old whippet cross called Dash, into RSPCA care.

Both dogs were treated by a vet and cared for at a rescue centre before being rehomed.
