Generally people like their chicken and soft drinks to come in separate containers, and don't even particularly enjoy mixing them together in their mouths.

But the Chinese division of U.S. potato chip maker Lay's (owner of Walkers Crisps in the UK) is banking on tastes in the People's Republic being far more adventurous.

The Willy Wonka-esque Pepsi and chicken is just one of the bizarre flavours they have introduced to tempt increasingly affluent easterners into picking up a pack.

Others marketed by the global brand - which incidentally also owns Pepsi - include Numb and Spicy Hot Pot, Cheese Lobster, Hot and Sour Fish soup and the comparatively normal sounding Braised Pork.

Other firms, not to be outdone, are producing flavours including Kimchi (a Korean dish made of fermented vegetables), Tomato Seafood and even Chicken Wing and Pizza (together, on one crisp).

As the world's fastest growing major economy, with growth rates averaging 10 per cent over the past three decades, China is a market any company that cares about its future is keen to crack.

The West's junk-food giants are no exception and they have come up with a range of adaptations to their popular but generally unhealthy snacks to appeal to the eastern palate.

Cultural differences, it has often been noted, do make Chinese tastes seem odd to those of us in the West. But can that explain the apparent gap in the market one manufacturer has found for chicken and pizza wing flavour?

Willy Wonker himself would be proud of these concoctions including cheese lobster and kimchi

Shanghaiist, which tested out the bizarre flavour, describes it as a 'gangbang of sodium, corn syrup, and other chemicals' with the texture of 'stale McDonald's fries'.

The blog's food editor selected what he sees as the eight wierdest. Pepsi and Chicken, he said, actually succeeded in pairing the cinnamon sweetness of Pepsi with the the pang of a real roast.

Cheese and Lobster was more hit and miss. Shanghaiist says the flavour 'invokes listening to a toddler bang on the piano; once in a while you think you're picking up some semblance of a melody, but it could be your imagination.'
