England batsman Gary Ballance escaped any punishment on Wednesday night despite pictures emerging of the boozy star stripped to the waist in a Nottingham nightclub hours after the first Test draw against India.

Witnesses claimed Ballance, partying with team-mates Jimmy Anderson, Joe Root and Liam Plunkett, was carried from the bar at the Pandora’s Box club on Sunday night and was heard shouting: ‘I’m not a cricketer tonight. I’m just a drunken b*****d.’

The Ballance incident is the last thing England need, coming just 24 hours after paceman Anderson was hit with a Level Three charge of assault against India’s  Ravindra Jadeja.

England head coach Peter Moores 
insisted there would be no disciplinary action after the pictures of 
Ballance appeared on The Tab website.

Moores said: ‘As the players had been 
released at the end of the first Test and were not due to meet up to 
begin preparations for the second Test until Monday evening, and there 
were no suggestions of impropriety, there is no need for any 
disciplinary action.

‘I will, however, be reminding all players of their responsibilities to uphold the best possible image for England cricket.’

Earlier, England captain Alastair Cook accused India of trying to get Anderson banned.

Cook labelled the affair a ‘big 
mountain out of a molehill’ but India skipper MS Dhoni insisted Anderson
 had committed a serious offence as relations between the sides worsened
 ahead of today’s second Investec Test at Lord’s.

If Anderson is found guilty of 
‘abusing and pushing’ Jadeja, the England fast bowler could miss up to 
four Tests. The incident arose after Anderson and Jadeja exchanged words
 as the players left the field for lunch on the second day at Trent 
Bridge. As they walked up the narrow steps to the dressing rooms inside 
the pavilion, England claim Jadeja got in Anderson’s personal space.

India allege Anderson pushed Jadeja, at which point Jadeja was led away by his batting partner Dhoni.

Both sides claim they have witnesses who will testify in their favour.

India’s reserve seamers Ishwar Pandey and Pankaj Singh will give evidence against Anderson.

Cook was asked if he thought the Indians were motivated by the thought of depriving England of their spearhead.

‘I think that’s pretty much where it’s come from,’ he replied.

But Dhoni maintained India were right 
to press charges. ‘We felt what happened was wrong,’ he said. ‘This is 
not something we have done. We can do a press conference and I can 
choose to answer questions or not answer them, but in no way can I touch
 you or you can come and touch me.'
