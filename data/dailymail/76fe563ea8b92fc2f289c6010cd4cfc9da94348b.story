The bill arrives at the end of your meal in a restaurant and you look to see how much you should tip – 5 per cent? Ten per cent?

Not at Noodles & Co, an American fast-food restaurant serving noodles, sandwiches, salads and soups inspired by cuisines from around the globe.

Its chairman Kevin Reddy has introduced a no-tip rule at his eateries and says that the policy has been a success.

No tipping here: Customers at Noodles & Co do not leave a gratuity, a policy introduced by chairman Kevin Reddy who took over in 2006. ¿Being nice doesn't cost you anything,¿ he said

‘Respect doesn't cost you anything. Being nice doesn't cost you anything,’ he said, ‘and we don't really feel that folks should have to pay something additional for us to appreciate that they're choosing us over another restaurant.’

The no-tipping scheme is in place at Noodles & Co's 380 locations in 29 states and Washington, D.C.

The average cost of eating at Noodles is $8 (£4.80), which is more expensive than McDonald's where Mr Reddy used to work.

Since taking over in 2006 Mr Reddy has increased the number of Noodles from 284 to 380. He believes that the no-tipping policy is one reason for that success.

He also says that he pays his workers above minimum wage so they are not reliant on tips.

‘Either you enjoy people, and you treat them right, or you don't,’ he told Market Watch. ‘You're either genuine, truthful and nice, or you're not. If you would throw somebody under the bus to get ahead, nobody wants to work with you. You’re not going to make it in our culture.’
