A New Jersey woman has admitted to killing her neighbor's small dog by throwing it into traffic during an argument over a parking space.

Haniyyah Barnes, 27, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to breaking into her neighbor's home in Fabyan Place, Newark in August 2011 after she found the neighbor's car had blocked in a relative's vehicle.

She grabbed the victim's two-year-old Shih Tzu named Honey Bey by the neck and threw it into oncoming traffic, where she was struck by a vehicle and killed.

Barnes pleaded guilty to burglary, animal cruelty and theft charges and Essex County prosecutors will recommend that she receive a six-year state prison term when she's sentenced July 14, the New Jersey Star-Ledger reported.

Barnes also would have to pay up to $2,600 in restitution and would be barred from owning, buying or living with animals for 10 years.

Barnes also will have to participate in anger management and drug and alcohol counseling.

A Newark police officer who was sitting in a patrol vehicle saw what happened and immediately arrested Barnes.

Penalty: She faces six years behind bars when she is sentenced for the cruel crime in July

Scene: The incident came after the victim had blocked in Barnes' relative's vehicle along this road in Newark

She acknowledged that the neighbor had followed her outside, begging her to stop and not hurt the dog.

'It was a horrific crime and I think the punishment reflects that,' Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Michele Miller told the newspaper after the hearing.

'She broke into someone's home and killed their dog and they watched it happen. Not too many things are more disturbing than that.'
