A Mercedes left unlocked abandoned in a multi-storey car park has been towed away after gathering dust for three years. 

The car has been sitting idly in the Broadway Plaza car park in Birmingham after being deserted by its owner. 

After repeated failed attempts to have it collected, parking company APCOA towed the vehicle away this week. 

A Mercedes left unlocked in a city centre car park in Birmingham has been removed after sitting idle for around three years

The tax disc on the car's blackened windscreen expired in July 2012. Authorities were unable to track down its owner after numerous attempts

With spaces in the city-centre costing £13-a-day, the Mercedes C Class racked up £14,000 in unpaid fine over three years.

For years drivers skirted around the black car which was propped up by a safety barrier. 

While the owner was traced through a log book left inside, they did not respond to any of the parking company's numerous attempts to make contact.

And with the vehicle never having been reported as stolen, missing or involved in a crime, West Midlands Police saw no need to intervene. 

Birmingham City Council shrugged off responsibility for case too, with privately-owned APCOA forced to call in a third party to have it removed. 

'The car in question has been in situ for years,' an APCOA spokesman said.

The company which owns the car park made numerous failed attempts to contact its owner over the years

It was taken away by a third party brought in by APCOA after West Midlands Police and Birmingham City Council failed to intervene

Such a long-term stay in the car park would have cost the owner £14,000 if they had returned to claim the car

'The reason why the vehicle is effectively cordoned off is because one of the back wheels/axles is loose, and the car is propped up on one side for reasons of safety.

'West Midlands Police were made aware of the vehicle in the event that it may have been stolen. However, police records confirmed otherwise.

'The police recommended APCOA write to Birmingham City Council to request the removal of the abandoned vehicle.'

While local authorities are at a loss as to where the car came from, other drivers at the car park offered up their own bizarre theories.  

'What is it doing there? Why hasn’t it been moved? Is there a dead body in the trunk? Is it haunted?

'Thousands upon thousands of people must have driven past it over the years and thought similar things,' said one motorist.
