A man has reportedly claimed he lured six-year-old Etan Patz with candy, before stabbing him to death and chopping up his body - nearly 33 years after the boy vanished as he walked to the bus from his Manhattan home.

Pedro Hernandez, who worked as a shopkeeper and lived just blocks from Etan at the time of the boy's disappearance, reportedly told police he dumped the youngster's remains in the garbage.

Investigators swooped on him in Camden, New Jersey on Wednesday evening after a relative tipped off police that Hernandez had admitted to killing a boy shortly after Etan vanished.

Missing: Six-year-old Etan Patz vanished on the way to the school bus in 1979 and has never been found. Police have questioned a man who claims he stabbed the boy and dumped his body

The relative only called police after investigators excavated the basement of Othniel Miller, a handyman who had known Etan, in search for evidence last month. None was found.

Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said in a statement on Thursday that the man 'has made statements to NYPD detectives implicating himself in the disappearance and death of Etan Patz 33 years ago'

Commissioner Kelly added that further details would be released later today.

According to a source speaking to The New York Post, Hernandez told investigators he had enticed the boy with sweets, stabbed him, cut up his body and put him in plastic bags.

But in a conflicting report from The Associated Press, another source said Hernandez claimed he suffocated the boy and left the body in a box in a Manhattan alleyway.

After moving to New Jersey shortly after, Hernandez told family members he had killed a boy but did not mention his name, sources said. He also told a spiritual adviser in the 1980s about killing a child.

The confession led a relative to call police after the high-profile search of Miller's SoHo basement.

Unsolved: Etan Patz vanished on the way to the school bus in SoHo, New York City in May 1978

Police told DNAinfo.com they have no hard evidence to support the confession.

But if true, the claims - which come almost exactly 33 years after Etan vanished - could solve a case that shocked America and raised awareness of the plight of missing children across the country.

It will also bring closure to Etan's parents, Julie and Stanley, who have not moved from their SoHo home since his disappearance in the hope that he will someday return.

The revelations come a day short of the anniversary of his disappearance; he was last seen on May 25, 1979 as he walked to the bus stop - the first time his parents had let him go alone.

It sparked an international manhunt and he became the first child whose 'missing' photo appeared on the side of a milk carton. May 25 is now National Missing Children's Day.

He was officially declared dead in 2001. In May 2010, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said they were taking a fresh look at the decades-old case of the missing six-year-old.

Questions: In the 1980s, Jose Ramos, right, was identified as a prime suspect but no hard evidence has ever linked him to the crime. Last month, police searched the basement of handyman Othniel Miller, left

Search: In April, police swooped on Miller's basement - under the blue tarp - in a renewed search for evidence

Just weeks ago, police launched an intensive search for the missing boy when they dug up the basement workshop of Miller, who knew the six-year-old from the area.

Miller, now 75, was questioned several times by police after his ex-wife told them about the alleged rape of his niece. He 'sky rocketed to the top of the list' of suspects after the claims, police said.

The missing boy's mother, Julie Patz, was also said to have told agents to look again at the handyman, who befriended Etan before he vanished and hired Ramos to do odd jobs for him.

Concrete had been laid over the foundation of the basement shortly after the youngster vanished - but the search did not yield any new evidence.

When authorities told Miller cadaver dogs picked up the scent of human remains at his basement he allegedly blurted out: 'What if the body was moved?'

In light of the claims by Hernandez, Michael Farkas, Miller's lawyer, told the Post he 'has said all along that Miller had nothing to do with the case'.

Renewed search: The FBI searched the basement belonging to Miller, a handyman who knew Etan from the area, after his ex-wife claimed he had raped his niece. The search yielded no new evidence

Hope: Investigators sent off concrete, which was laid down shortly after Etan's disappearance, for analysis

'[Miller] has nothing to do with this latest suspect, that I know of,' Farkas added.

While no one has ever been arrested or charged with Etan's disappearance, Jose Ramos - a drifter whose girlfriend was the boy's babysitter - was identified as a prime suspect in 1985.

Jailed for an unrelated crime, Ramos, 68, later told a prison cell mate he knew every stop of the bus route that took Etan to school and knew the six-year-old got off at the third stop.

He admitted to taking a boy back to his apartment to rape him on the day Etan disappeared, but he said he let the boy go. He said he was '90 per cent sure' it was the same boy he later saw on TV.

No hard evidence has linked him to the crime. He is now in a Pennsylvania jail on a 20-year sentence for abusing two boys and is due to be released in November.

Etan's father has previously said: 'Jose Antonio Ramos is the man who abducted my child. We lost our child to a pedophile, and that's not comprehensible.'

Pain: Stanley Patz, Etan's father, watched over the search from the family's home half a block away

Grief: Julie Patz watches the search for clues to her son's disappearance in April from her window

Family: After the disappearance in 1979, Julie Patz, left, appeared on a number of TV shows to try to find her son. Right, Stan Patz, holds a photo of Etan as he poses with his other son Ari

Along with Etan's mother Julie, Stanley Patz watched over the search in April from their apartment just half a block away.

They have never moved from their home, in the hope their son would one day find his way back. Nor have they changed their phone number, as Etan knew it off by heart.

His father said another reason they did not want to move was because of their other two children, Shira, who was eight at the time of the disappearance, and Ari, two.

Stanley and Julie Patz have continued to fight for a legal resolution to their son’s death. In 2000 they spoke with CBS's 60 Minutes about their refusal to give up hope.

Julie Patz said at the time: 'We have his belongings all over the house. To put them away, it seems to us and to our children that he's gone and he's not coming back.'

Convinced that Ramos is guilty of the crime, Stan Patz sends him a copy of the missing child poster twice a year with the words 'What have you done with my little boy' written on the back.

Police said they expect to provide further details on the new developments later today.

Etan’s disappearance came before a time when the faces of missing children would peer out from milk cartons and TV movies explored a seeming epidemic of vanishing children.

The only small comfort his parents ever received from their son's abduction was knowing that it had become the catalyst in the search for missing children.

His disappearance prompted such an extensive search that by 1985, it had taken in the whole of America, parts of Europe and even reached Israel.

May 25, the day Etan disappeared, is National Missing Children's Day, which was named by President Reagan in 1983 in honor of the missing six-year-old.

An entire network for tracking missing children emerged since then, including Amber Alerts and pictures on milk cartons - Etan's was the first picture of a missing child to ever be put on a milk carton.

After 30 years the case is still officially open and the world has never forgotten the face of the blue-eyed, blond-haired boy who captivated a nation.

Each administration since Reagan has honored the annual reminder to the nation to renew efforts to reunite missing children with their families and make child protection a national priority.

On the day he disappeared, the school noted Etan's absence but did not notify his parents. It wasn't until 3.30pm his mother Julie realized he was missing and called police.

His father Stan, a professional photographer, dispatched black-and-white photographs of Etan in an effort to find him.

The massive search and media attention that followed focused the nation’s attention on the problem of child abduction and lack of plans to address it after it became apparent there was no coordinated effort between federal, state, and local law enforcement, no national response system in place and no central resource to help searching families.

Etan's parents have since become outspoken advocates for missing children.

For years, they refused to change their phone number, in the hope that Etan was alive somewhere, and might call. They never moved in the hope he would return home.
