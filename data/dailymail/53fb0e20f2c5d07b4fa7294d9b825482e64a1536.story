Swap: The traditional red poppy should be replaced with white poppies according to actor Mark Rylance

The traditional red poppy should be replaced with white poppies on  Remembrance Sunday according to actor Mark Rylance.

He believes the white poppy should be worn to commemorate civilian victims rather than Britain's military dead, with red poppies making war seem 'inevitable.'

Traditionally the red flower is worn every
November as a mark of respect to war veterans, members of the Armed 
Forces who have lost their lives, and their families.

Every year 40 million red paper poppies 
are made and sold by the Royal British Legion, with all the money raised
providing support for the Armed Forces and their families.

But Mr Rylance, a former artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, said he decided to wear white because 90 per cent of casualties of war are now civilians, not soldiers, according to The Daily Telegraph.

If the country is to remember 'the tragedy of war' every year, civilian casualties should be recognised, he told he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

The flower was chosen as a symbol of 
remembrance in the aftermath of the First World War, during which the 
shells and shrapnel which fell on the trenches and craters of Flanders 
led to a mass of poppies covering the killing fields.

Mr Rylance, said he had 'enormous 
sympathy' for the suffering of soldiers and their families.

But he added: 'I think it's a slightly 
different thing if you sign up to go out and fight in one of these wars 
and you know that 90 per cent of the people who are going to suffer will
be civilian people who have not signed up to the war.

'So it is a
slightly different thing if you have agreed to be part of it than if 
you are just a bystander or a child or people at a wedding who get hurt.

He said he was concerned that the red poppy had 'become a way of raising money to cover the cost that I think the 
government or perhaps the arms manufacturers themselves would be better 
to pay for.'

The White Poppy was first introduced by the Women's Co-operative Guild in 1933 and was intended as a lasting symbol for peace and an end to all wars.

It was was produced by the Co-operative Wholesale Society because the Royal British Legion had refused to be associated with its manufacture.

But many veterans felt that its significance undermined their contribution and the lasting meaning of the red poppy.

Such was the seriousness of this issue that some women lost their jobs in the 1930s for wearing white poppies.

The Peace Pledge Union (PPU), meanwhile, which began producing and distributing the white poppy in association with the Co-operative Women's Guild in 1934 after falling out with the Legion over the wording of the tribute.
