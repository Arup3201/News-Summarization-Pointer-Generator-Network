Cameron cutie: Caroline Dinenage has left her husband and is now dating a fellow Tory MP

A Tory government whip who walked out on his four-month-old daughter is dating a ‘Cameron cutie’ who left her husband.

Mark Lancaster and mother-of-two Caroline Dinenage admitted to their  relationship after they started attending party events together.

Mr Lancaster, 43, an army major, began seeing Miss Dinenage, 41, after she left her Royal Navy husband.

Miss Dinenage, referred to as one of Cameron’s cuties because she was among the many Tory women selected to stand at the last election, said yesterday: ‘Yes, I am seeing Mark Lancaster.’

The Westminster relationship is the latest chapter in Mr Lancaster’s complicated love life.

In 2007, he split from his wife Katherine, a lawyer, after 12 years and started dating journalist Amanda Evans.  He and his wife later divorced.

Miss Evans became pregnant with a daughter, but they split 18 months into their relationship when the baby was four months old.

The MP for Milton Keynes North claimed that the break-up was  amicable and blamed it on ‘incredibly long hours’.

But Miss Evans is said to have thought he was ‘not taking an active interest’ in their daughter Lily-Mae.

A year after the breakdown of that relationship he began dating Kathryn Buckle, an election agent for Daventry Conservative Association in Northamptonshire, but they split last year.

Mr Lancaster and Miss Dinenage, daughter of TV presenter Fred Dinenage, were first seen together when she took him as her guest to a black tie dinner.

In the campaign for her Gosport seat in Hampshire, where she replaced Sir Peter Viggers, who retired after claiming for a duck house on parliamentary expenses, Miss Dinenage boasted that she was a ‘navy wife’.

But she estimated her Royal Navy 
officer husband Carlos Garreta had been away at sea for six or seven of 
their ten years of marriage. She said: ‘We managed the childcare through
 a combination of professional and family help, but it’s not been easy.’

The businesswoman, who 
runs a badge-making company, was last month appointed one of 12 small 
business ambassadors by the Prime Minister.

She
 started her political career as a local councillor in Winchester before
 unsuccessfully standing as a candidate in Portsmouth in 2005.

The other man: Mark Lancaster, MP for Milton Keynes North East, walked out on his the partner and their four month old daughter last year after an 18-month relationship

She won her seat in Gosport with a majority of 14,413.

She recently voted against same sex weddings, arguing that banning gay couples from marrying ‘takes nothing away from their relationship’.

Mr Lancaster was made a whip  by Mr Cameron last September.

He lives in a £750,000 home in Olney, Buckinghamshire.

Before becoming an MP at the 2005 election, Mr Lancaster served as an officer in the Queen’s Gurkha Engineers, based in Hong Kong, and was a director of his family’s company, Kimbolton Fireworks, which is named after their home village in Cambridgeshire.

He continues to serve as a major in the Territorial Army and spent the 2006 summer recess on active service alongside British troops  in Afghanistan.

When asked whether he was in a relationship with Miss Dinenage, he said: ‘Absolutely.’

Miss Dinenage is the eldest daughter of Fred Dinenage, 71, who presented children’s television show How as well as ITV News Meridian.

After filing for divorce in 2011 she was divorced in May 2012 and started dating Mr Lancaster at the end of last year.
