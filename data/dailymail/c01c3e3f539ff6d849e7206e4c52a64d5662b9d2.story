A woman who ran a drink-drive awareness course for more than 20 years has been banned from the road after being caught behind the wheel while three times over the limit.

Alison Baker, 59, was found to have 104mg of alcohol in her breath after driving to her local garage in Exeter, Devon, to buy wine twice in one morning.

Exeter Magistrates' Court heard how a garage worker tipped police off about her being drunk after becoming concerned that she was not in a fit state to drive.

Officers were sent to her home and when she eventually answered the door she was so drunk that she had to grip walls and furniture to stand.

She told police she had only had a gulp of wine but was found to be three times over the legal top limit.

Baker, who ran drink-drive awareness courses for Devon County Council for 20 years, denied drink-driving and blamed the high reading on 'post-driving consumption'.

However, district judge Stephen Nicholls convicted her of drink-driving and handed her an interim driving ban until she is sentenced next month.

During the trial, Baker denied using her intimate professional knowledge of alcohol units and driving to 'tailor her defence'.

She said she drove to the garage at 8am on May 13 last year to buy the first bottle of wine because she 'could not cope'.

The court heard Baker used alcohol for pain relief for arthritis and had problems with her knees, legs and wrist.

Giving evidence, she admitted that she drank herself into 'oblivion' while self-medicating and would often drink until she passed out.

She also admitted that she would decant wine from bottles so that she could hide them from her disapproving landscape gardener husband Andy who hated her drinking.

She said she had only drunk a small mug of wine after her first visit to the garage on May 13 but realised by 10.30am that 'it was not enough wine to knock me out' and so drove back to the garage to get a second bottle.

Garage worker Devon Greening claimed he saw Baker 'stumble and trip' the second time she entered the shop to buy her second bottle of wine.

CCTV was shown to the court but Baker did not appear unsteady on her feet.

However, Mr Greening said that he was also concerned that she smelt strongly of alcohol and said he would have 'felt bad if she hit someone'.

He reported Baker to police after she left the garage to drive home.

Police officer John Larcombe-Ford arrived at her Exeter home ten minutes later.

Baker claimed to the officer that she had drank more than one and a half bottles of wine at her home in the ten minutes between arriving home and him arriving.

She told the court: 'I can't remember the police coming to the house.'

Mr Larcombe-Ford said she 'was clearly drunk and unsteady on her feet' when she answered the door.

He said she gripped the walls, door and furniture for support and slumped into a reclining armchair.

Baker told him she had had 'a swig from a bottle of wine' in the previous 20 minutes but she was arrested.

On the trip to the police station, she told him that she was 'a trainer and facilitator for drink-driving awareness courses'.

The officer said colleagues searched for empty bottles at her home but found nothing apart from a full water bottle which had had wine poured into it.

The court heard how she would often hide empty bottles of wine from her husband, even scurrying them away in the equipment she used for her drink-drive courses.

Appearing at court, Baker claimed she downed just 'two units' between trips to the garage saying five units is the legal limit.

She added: 'I would not normally drive with any alcohol in my system.

'I knew I was not over the legal limit. I knew I had not drunk enough to put me over the limit.'

Baker was convicted of drink-driving at Exeter Magistrates' Court (pictured) and will be sentenced next monthÂ 

She denied downing the first bottle of wine before driving back to the garage and said: 'I had had a mugful - 175mls.'

Prosecutor Sarah Hornblower said the high alcohol reading was not contested by Baker who claimed she was under the top limit of 35mg of alcohol when she drove.

However, the district judge concluded that Baker had drunk most if not all of the first bottle of wine before driving back to the garage to get some more.

Baker will be sentenced next month but may not be ordered to go on the drink-drive rehabilitation course which she used to run after the prosecutor said it would not be appropriate.

The former drink-drive tutor has previously condemned driving while over the limit and said in a previous interview: 'The realities of life without a driving licence can be difficult to bear, some people lose everything.

'They struggle to pay their mortgage, lose their home, their wife walks out and takes the kids.

'There is also a real stigma and sense of shame attached to drink driving convictions. Some people find it difficult to live with the guilt of having committed an offence.'
