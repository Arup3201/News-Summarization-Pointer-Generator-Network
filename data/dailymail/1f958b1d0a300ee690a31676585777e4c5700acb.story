Playing again: Paul Gray says years of loud music shattered his hearing

Musician Paul Gray first suspected he might have tinnitus while mid-way through a tour with punk band The Damned more than 30 years ago.

‘I was in my hotel room one night, and I’d turned the TV off, but could still hear a high-pitched whiney sound,’ he says. ‘I wondered where it was coming from, looked all around the room, opened the windows, and then figured that it might just be tinnitus.’

This was in 1981, and back then few, if any, musicians wore earplugs when they played live. ‘The yellow foam ones looked uncool and the wax ones were totally unsuitable for musicians as they cut out too much sound,’ says Paul.

Besides, a lot of musicians — not to mention young fans — saw temporary hearing loss after a gig as something of a badge of honour.

‘Back then, it was a case of “Oh, it must have been a great gig, my ears are still ringing”, ’ says Paul, who first found fame as a bass guitarist with Eddie And The Hot Rods before going on to join The Damned and then later working with former Wham! star Andrew Ridgeley.

Tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree, according to the British Tinnitus Association. Many have hearing damage as a result of being exposed to loud noise, be it in industry, the armed forces or the music business. Last month, the World Health Organisation said people should listen to music for no more than an hour a day, to prevent damage to their hearing.

Tinnitus can also be triggered by conditions such as Meniere’s disease, or in older people it can occur as a result of age-related hearing loss. Sufferers experience a constant whirring or whistling in their ears and many struggle to find an effective treatment.

At first Paul, now 56, experienced ‘a whine in my ears that was louder in my right ear, a bit like the sound of a jet turbine cranking up.’ It was worse after gigs, but it would come and go, until one night in 1995 while Paul was on stage with Captain Sensible (who topped the charts with his cover of Happy Talk in the Eighties).

‘There was this deafening screech of feedback, so loud that it physically knocked me several feet back,’ he says.

‘I ran off before the next song and stuffed toilet paper in my ears, but the damage had been done.’

Afterwards any sudden noise — doors banging, car breaks, shouting — would make him jump.

Back home in Cardiff, Paul’s doctor referred him to a specialist at the University Hospital of Wales Ear, Nose and Throat Department, who diagnosed ‘high-frequency hearing loss’ after acoustic trauma, and advised him to limit his exposure to noise — and to get a new career. But for Paul, being a musician was more than a job.

‘It was my life. So I carried on for a couple more years.’

However, the tinnitus gradually worsened. ‘It was exacerbated by extraneous noises I had no control over, such as knives on plates, glasses clinking, children shouting — and I was hugely stressed.’

By 1997, Paul had to admit defeat and call time on his musical career. He returned to the hospital and was prescribed maskers — a hearing aid-type device that played a hissing noise in his ears, now more commonly known as white noise generators.

‘We were trying to retrain his brain into not focusing on the tinnitus — it was a distraction technique,’ says Tim Bord, a senior audiologist at the hospital, who has been treating Paul since the mid-Nineties.

Paul was supposed to wear maskers for eight hours a day for a year. ‘But I couldn’t follow conversations or hear the television properly, because I had great big pieces of plastic in each ear,’ he says.

By now, even the click of a light switch aggravated his condition. ‘I pretty much became a recluse for the next few years, which contributed to my divorce,’ he says.

In the late Nineties Paul was referred for counselling with a clinical psychologist, but this didn’t work. He turned to alternative treatments, from the Alexander Technique (a method of relaxation) to acupuncture. 

At one stage he tried ‘laser pen therapy’ — shining a torch into your ear to stimulate the growth of hair cells in the inner ear, as tinnitus has been linked to damaged hair cells.

‘You name it, I threw money at it, but they were all useless,’ says Paul, who resorted to hiding earplugs around the house to cope with the noise when his young son Jeff had friends round to play.

Nowadays, one of the most common treatments is cognitive behavioural therapy — a psychotherapeutic approach that tries to get the patient to change how they think about tinnitus.

While this was some help, Paul concluded he was just going to have to learn to live with his condition. He carries custom-fitted maximum protection earplugs ‘which keep the frequencies down and cuts external noise by about 25 decibels’.

Basic sets can be bought from most music shops, while Specsavers charges between £50 and £100 for a made-to-measure pair.

Paul also avoids noisy places as, like for many sufferers, background noise makes the problem worse.

‘If I’m in a pub or restaurant I always try to position myself against the wall, so I only have sound coming from one direction,’ he says.

There have been some advances in treatments since Paul was first diagnosed — such as the introduction of smaller ‘in-ear’ white noise generators, and devices that combine a hearing aid and sound generator in one.

Paul  has now learned to live with his condition and is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music

A new treatment, neuromodulation — an earplug-type device designed to target the specific frequencies that distress an individual — is available privately, but is still undergoing trials.

Recently, researchers at the University of Western Australia said they’d identified a drug that blocks ‘hyperactivity’ in the area of the brain that processes sound — although they are yet to test the effect in humans.

Meanwhile, Paul is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music.

‘We run a scheme called the Musician’s Hearing Passport, which gives comprehensive tests and advice on hearing protection by an audiologist,’ he says.

‘Often when I ask students to raise their hands if their ears have ever rung, eight out of ten will put their hands up. These kids are 18, 19 years old, and don’t realise the damage that’s already been done.

‘There’s still the attitude that I had, that noise is fun and that “if it’s too loud, you’re too old”.’

Paul, who has recorded a new album, A Postcard From Britain, with his old bandmate Captain Sensible, is able to play again for up to an hour at a time, so long as he wears his earplugs.

He says his father had always warned him being in a rock band would ‘make me go deaf’ but he had ignored him.

‘If I knew then how my life was going to be affected by noise damage — I’m pretty deaf now — I would definitely have taken steps to protect myself. After all, a musician needs ears . . . they’re pretty vital tools of the trade.’
