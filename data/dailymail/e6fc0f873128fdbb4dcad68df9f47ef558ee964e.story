A retired couple have hit out at a hotel's food standards after they contracted gastroenteritis while on holiday in the Canary Islands.

David and Lynne Fossey, from Bristol, claim they were left bed-bound just days into a two-week stay at ClubHotel Riu Oliva Beach Resort, Fuerteventura. 

David, 71, said he was struck down with severe stomach cramps, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting within hours of Lynne, 65, suffering similar symptoms a few days into their trip.

David said the all-inclusive hotel - which they booked through Thomson - 'regularly' left food uncovered, and meals were served 'lukewarm'. 

They claim they ate all of their meals during the holiday at the hotel.

The couple, who have been married for 47 years and visited the hotel in 2013, allege they spent two days confined to their room, too ill to leave.

The resort doctor, called when their conditions worsened, diagnosed the couple with gastroenteritis and prescribed capsules and rehydration salts. 

David said: 'My wife and I wanted a relaxing holiday together in the sun and were looking forward to returning to the Riu Oliva Beach Hotel after visiting the year before and having a wonderful time.

'But this was ruined when we both began to feel unwell midway through the holiday. We were unable to leave the hotel, enjoy the weather, the facilities or our remaining time away together.

'I was disappointed with the hotel this time. My wife and I noticed in the restaurant that some of the food was regularly left uncovered and on occasions the food was served lukewarm and I noticed that on occasions freshly produced food was often added to food already out on the buffet.

'Compared to our last visit the previous year, the hotel looked run down and required decorating. 

'I noticed plaster coming off the wall. It was simply not the same hotel I had holidayed at the previous year.'

The couple have instructed lawyers Irwin and Mitchell to investigate on their behalf, adding that 'we would like answers on what caused us to become ill', adding that they have ongoing symptoms.. 

Amandeep Samra, spokesman for Irwin Mitchell's international personal injury team, said: 'Aside from making holidays extremely unpleasant, gastroenteritis can have a long-term impact on a sufferer's health.

'Our clients have described how they had been looking forward to their holiday. 

'They did not expect to fall ill or continue to suffer illness upon return home. These new claims are still being investigated and we hope tour operator Thomson will work with us to ascertain what caused our clients to fall ill. 

'The tour operator also continues to investigate these claims and their position on whether liability is admitted or denied is awaited.'

Thomson issued this statement after being contacted by Travelmail: 'Thomson is sorry to hear of Mr and Mrs Fossey’s experience at the ClubHotel Riu Oliva Beach Resort this summer.

'As we understand legal proceedings for this case have started, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.

'We would like to reassure customers that Thomson closely audits all resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards.'
