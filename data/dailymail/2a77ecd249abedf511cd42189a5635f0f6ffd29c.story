It might make your heart stop just looking at it but a brioche filled with a fry-up has beaten all other innovative breakfasts to come top at this year's Best Breakfast Awards.

The  Full English Bunny from London restaurant Bunnychow consists of a hollowed-out loaf filled with sausage, lean bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, spicy baked beans, black pudding all topped with a fried egg.

And now the £4 dish has been named the UK's Most Innovative Breakfast in the 2015 Best Breakfast Awards.

The brioche is locally sourced and baked fresh each day, supplied by The London Bakery Company, while the spicy beans and black pudding are made to a special in-house recipe.

Bunnychow CEO Atholl Milton said: 'Everyone loves a hot breakfast so we wanted to take our South African heritage of using the loaf and then packing it full of fresh breakfast produce. 

'Since we opened three months ago the Full English Bunny has been popular with the local office workers and commuters on the hop. We're delighted they are now award-winning!'

From hundreds of entries Soho-based Bunnychow was deemed to have the most innovative breakfast dish. 

Judge Karen Levy, who works for the cereals company that organised the awards, said: 'We loved the classic cooked breakfast ingredients being served in a new and innovative way. It's great for busy commuters and fits with the growing trend for on-the-go breakfasts'.

TV chef and breakfast lover Phil Vickery, who helped judge the innovative award category, presented Bunnychow with their award and tasted the Full English Bunny for himself.

Phil said: 'From the hundreds of entries we received Bunnychow's dish was a standout winner. It's great to have a hot breakfast that you can eat without a knife and fork.'

Breakfast Week, which runs until 31 January, is a national campaign organised on behalf of UK cereal farmers and producers, to celebrate the importance of breakfast.

It is now in its 16th year and aims to raise awareness of the importance of eating breakfast. 

The campaign is organised by HGCA, which is the cereals and oilseeds division of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB).
