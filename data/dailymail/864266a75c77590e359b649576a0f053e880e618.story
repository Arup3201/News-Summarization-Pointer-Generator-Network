Spy chiefs may have been operating a secret ‘snoopers’ charter’ to track people’s internet use in the UK, a senior Government minister has admitted.

Business Secretary Vince Cable made the claim after it emerged GCHQ trawled through private information, including emails, photographs and social networking pages, harvested by a secret U.S. surveillance programme.

Critics accused agents at the listening post of attempting to bypass British law by sending requests for intercepts to American authorities – a claim denounced as ‘fanciful nonsense’ by Foreign Secretary William Hague.

'Snoopers' charter': Vince Cable admitted the Government had used a U.S. spy programme to monitor people's internet use

Investigators usually need a court order or warrant to access personal communications.

But they have been able to sidestep this crucial safeguard by asking for details of individuals’ web activity hoovered up by Prism, a system run by the US  National Security Agency (NSA).

GCHQ compiled 197 intelligence dossiers from Prism in a single year. It has had access to the programme since at least 2010.

Mr Hague faces a ferocious Commons grilling today when he is sure to be asked exactly when ministers knew about the intelligence trade-off.

British agency: GCHQ, based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was said to have generated 197 intelligence reports through the system in the 12 months to May 2012 - a 137 per cent increase on the previous year

Asked yesterday if the system had 
allowed the Government to operate a covert ‘snoopers’ charter’, Liberal 
Democrat Mr Cable said: ‘It may well have been.’

The Lib Dems oppose controversial  
£400million plans to give intelligence agencies powers to monitor the 
public’s every phone call, email and internet click.

But supporters claim that, without the new laws, paedophiles, organised criminals and terrorists will escape detection.

Mr Hague repeatedly declined to say whether or not he had personally authorised GCHQ to engage with Prism.

But he insisted the eavesdropping centre operated within a ‘strong’ legal framework, with reviews of decisions by the Interception Commissioner.

Mr Hague said: ‘I can't ever confirm 
or deny in public what Britain knows or doesn't know about.

'We can talk 
about the framework that we do things. We can't possible go into “we 
exactly do this”.

‘Ministers
give authority to the actions of GCHQ and what it does has to be in 
line with those authorities. Intelligence gathering operations come to 
me or the Home Secretary personally.

‘We
take our duties on that very seriously. We spend hours on these things 
every week. Our decisions are then subject to continual review by an 
Interception Commissioner.'

Tory MP David Davis, a former shadow home secretary, said: ‘Nobody will argue against target surveillance of individuals but there are problems with mass sweeps of information. It invades people’s privacy and you lose support.’

Mr Cable said 
it was a possibility that the Prism system may have allowed the 
Government to operate a covert sort of snoopers' charter.

He added: ‘One
is that the Americans have developed this very sophisticated Prism 
system, which enables them to get access to data in other countries, 
with or without our knowledge.

'And there is a separate issue about 
whether GCHQ were involved in some collaborative exercise,’ Mr Cable 
told Sky News.

‘I think a lot of people will be 
reassured that we do work well with the Americans, but the whole point 
about surveillance is you have got to have it when you're dealing with 
terrorism or other crimes.’

But he added that all surveillance had to be ‘proportionate’, with ‘some oversight, legal and political’.

government direct access to its servers

The existence of Prism was disclosed in reports by The Guardian and The Washington Post.

It is said to give America's National Security Agency and the FBI easy access to the systems of nine of the world's top internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo and Skype.

It was reportedly established in 2007 under changes to US surveillance laws passed under President George Bush and renewed last year under Barack Obama in order to provide in depth surveillance on live communications and stored information on foreigners overseas.

The row crossed the Atlantic after The Guardian said it had seen documents showing that GCHQ had access to the Prism system since at least June 2010.

The British agency, based at Cheltenham, was said to have generated 197 intelligence reports through the system in the 12 months to May 2012 - a 137 per cent increase on the previous year.

According to the newspaper, the Prism programme appeared to allow GCHQ to circumvent the formal legal process required to obtain personal material, such as emails, photographs and videos, from internet companies based outside the UK.

GCHQ refused to comment directly on the report, but in a statement it insisted that it operated within a 'strict legal and policy framework'.
