The Gulf Stream, the ocean current that brings mild weather to northern Europe and balmy conditions to the south east of the US, is slowing at its fastest rate in  1,000 years.

New research has revealed that the enormous currents that circulate warm and cold water around the Atlantic ocean has slowed by 15-20 per cent over the past century.

Scientists say that the increasing flow of fresh water from melting Greenland ice sheets may be driving the slowdown.

The graphic above shows the sea in the North Atlantic is cooler than the surrounding ocean due to the influx of fresh water from the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which has slowed the gulf stream, say scientists

Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, an oceans physicist at the Potsdam Insittute for Climate Impact Research, said: 'It is conspicuous that one specific area in the North Atlantic has been cooling in the past hundred years while the rest of the world heats up.

'Now we have detected strong evidence that the global conveyor has indeed been weakening in the past hundred years, particularly since 1970.

Climate change could make the food we eat taste worse, according to recent research.

A major report on the impact of global warming on food has predicted that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase.

The researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common, meat like chicken and beef will become stringier and tougher.

Carrots are likely to lose their flavour and develop a less pleasant texture.

Beetroots and onions will become smaller while milk will contain less protein needed to make cheese.

A separate study by marine biologists has also shown that  shellfish will take on a sour flavour as our oceans acidify.

They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising.

Shrimp raised in water with a lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting, while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. 

The findings suggest that as global temperatures rise due to climate change, areas that are warmed by the Gulf Stream could see temperatures fall, particularly in the winter.

The Gulf Stream is a powerful current that forms part of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

This is a system of currents that are driven by the rising and sinking of water in different regions of the Atlantic.

Warm water from the equator is driven north towards the Artic where it cools, increases in salinity and sinks to the ocean depths.

This drives deep sea currents that pump water back to the equator, where it is warmed, rising to the surface and feeding the currents towards the pole.

In the Arctic, cold salty water sinks to the ocean depths, driving deep sea currents down to the equator where warmer water then rises to the surface and feeds the Gulf Stream.

The influx of warm water from the equator, which travels up through the Gulf of Mexico, past Maine and then up the west side of Britain and Norway, helps to warm weather systems in Northern Europe.

It makes winter conditions in much of northern Europe far milder than they normally would be, keeping Britain and the west coast of Norway largely snow and ice free through the winter months.

The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the sea in the northern Atlantic is colder than predicted by computer models.

They estimate that 8,000 cubic kilometres of fresh melt water haver flowed into the northern Atlantic from Greenland's icesheets between 1900 and 1970.

The North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is the northwards flow of warm surface water (shown in red by in the graphic above) and the southwards flow of cold water in the deep ocean (shown in blue)

They say between 1970 and 2000 an additional 13,000 cubic kilometres of fresh water has poured into the Atlantic from Greenland.

This fresh water is less dense than the salty water of the ocean and tends to float on the surface, disturbing the balance that causes cold water to sink in that region.

Usually freezing sea ice in the arctic causes the salinity of the ocean water to increase and so become more dense. Adding fresh water dilutes this effect.

Using recent sea surface and atmospheric temperature data, along with data from ice-cores, tree rings and sediments, they found that the changes in the ocean currents are unprecedented since the year 900AD.

However, the researchers also found that the cooling above the Northern Atlantic may also help to slightly reduce the effect of warming on the continents due to climate change.

The melting of Greenland's ice sheets (above) is leading to an influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic

They warn, however, that if the circulation weakens too much it could even break down completely.

Professor Ramhmstorf said: 'If the slowdown of the Atlantic overturning continues, the impacts might be substantial.

'Disturbing the circulation will likely have a negative effect on the ocean ecosystem, and thereby fisheries and the associated livelihoods of many people in coastal areas.

'A slowdown also adds to the regional sea-level rise affecting cities like New York and Boston.

'Finally, temperature changes in that region can also influence weather systems on both sides of the Atlantic, in North America as well as Europe.'

Professor Jason Box, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, said it appeared man-made climate change was responsible for the slow down of the Gulf Stream and may worsen as global temperatures increase.

He said: 'The human-caused mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet appears to be slowing down the Atlantic overturning – and this effect might increase if temperatures are allowed to rise further.'
