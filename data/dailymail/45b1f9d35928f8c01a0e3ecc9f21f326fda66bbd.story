New direction: Casey Anthony has become so experienced with the legal system since her daughter disappeared that she may be considering a job as a paralegal

Casey Anthony could become a paralegal after gaining legal experience while being tried for her two-year-old daughter's murder, her attorney said today.

The 26-year-old expected to make millions off book deals, movies and TV shows after she was acquitted in 2011 of murder in the death of her daughter Caylee.

But those big-money contracts for her story never materialized and now she faces three lawsuits and owes nearly $800,000, mostly stemming from the criminal case against her.

She has been out of work for four years and when asked what she may be interested in doing, her attorney Charles Greene said she might want to be a paralegal

'I truly believe that she has a lot of skills,' Mr Greene told ABCNews.com.

'She's better than many paralegals I know. She could be a paralegal or something like that right away.

Mr Greene said Anthony 'believes strongly in our justice system' and constitutional rights.

'I think she may be the type that ends up trying to work within our system to make our system better rather than being a person who's trying to break it down,' he said.

Anthony filed for bankruptcy in 
federal court in Tampa, Florida, on Friday, claiming she is unemployed 
and has had no recent income

Anthony was acquitted of killing her daughter in July 2011 after a sensational trial that divided America.

Caylee Marie Anthony, 2, went missing in June 2008 and was found in woods near her grandparents house six months later

A jury believed Anthonyâ€™s version of events that Caylee had accidentally drowned and she had panicked and buried the girl by her father George.

A search and rescue organisation today vowed to claw back $100,000 from Casey Anthony for the time they wasted searching for her missing daughter.

Texas based Equusearch are named as one of the creditors America's 'most hated' mom owes in her recent bankruptcy filing.

Investigation: Caylee Marie Anthony, 2, daughter of Casey Anthony, went missing in June 2008 and was found in woods near her grandparents house six months later

They are listed among more than 70 organisations and individuals who are owed money by Anthony who has debts of close to $1m.

Casey Anthony filed for bankruptcy in Florida on Friday, claiming about $1,100 in assets and $792,000 in liabilities.

Court records show that Anthony, who was acquitted of killing her 
2-year-old daughter Caylee in 2011, sought Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
protection in federal court in Tampa.

Her listed debts include $500,000 for attorney fees and costs for her 
criminal defense lawyer during the trial, Jose Baez; $145,660 for the 
Orange County Sheriff's office for a judgment covering investigative 
fees and costs related to the case; $68,540 for the Internal Revenue 
Service for taxes, interest and penalties; and $61,505 for the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement for court costs.

The filling also states that she is a defendant in several civil suits, 
including one brought by Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez for defamation in 
Orange County Circuit Court.

Fernandez-Gonzalez claims her reputation was damaged by Anthony telling 
detectives that a baby sitter by the same name kidnapped Caylee. The 
detectives were investigating the 2008 disappearance of the girl, who 
later was found dead.

Anthony's attorney said details offered by Anthony
did not match Fernandez-Gonzalez and clearly showed Anthony wasn't 
talking about her.

An attorney for Anthony, David Schrader, did not immediately respond to messages from the Associated Press.

Anthony lists about 80 creditors in the 60-page court filing. The claims
largely cover fees for legal, medical, psychiatric and forensics 
consulting or services. But one claim covers a debt for scuba diving 
services.

According to the courts, the aim of seeking Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
protection is to be discharged of most existing debts - essentially to 
obtain a fresh financial start.

A trustee may have the right to take 
possession of and sell non-exempt property and use the sale proceeds to 
pay creditors, but Anthony lists little in the way of assets.

A debtor 
may still be held responsible for some obligations, such as taxes and 
student loans.

The filing came on the same day that a Florida appellate court set aside
two of the four convictions she faced for lying to detectives during 
the investigation into her missing daughter.

Though Anthony was acquitted of killing Caylee, jurors convicted her of 
four counts of lying to detectives, and her attorneys appealed those 
convictions.

Anthony was sentenced to time served for the misdemeanors.

She was sentenced to a year of probation after her release from jail for
an unrelated case. For her protection, her whereabouts have been kept 
secret since she was released from state supervision last year.

She was offered $1m for the first interview after her acquittal but public revulsion towards her meant no network TV station would agree to air the chat.

NBC were threatened with an advertisers boycott after it was reported they were in negotiations to sign a deal with her.

The bankruptcy filing happened on the same day an appellate court in Florida threw out two of her four convictions.

Court records show that the bankruptcy petition was filed in the middle district of Florida.

It means Anthony must be residing in Florida and covers towns such as Fort Myers, Tampa and Jacksonville.
