Prosecutors said today that they have filed an additional sexual assault charge against the teenage boy accused of kidnapping and killing ten-year-old Jessica Ridgeway.

Austin Sigg, 17, allegedly used physical force and threats to sexually assault the Colorado girl, according to the latest charge.

Jessica was abducted as she walked to school in the Denver suburb of Westminster on October 5. Her body was so gruesomely dismembered that police struggled to identify the body.

Sigg is also accused of attacking a 22-year-old woman in Jessica's neighborhood in May.

The 22-year-old woman said she was 
running in a Westminster park when a man grabbed her from behind and 
placed a rag with a chemical smell over her mouth but she managed to escape.

During a hearing on Wednesday, District Court Chief Judge Stephen Munsinger said he would bar the public and the media from a preliminary hearing for Sigg. He explained that he wanted to avoid influencing any potential jurors if Sigg's case goes to trial.

Sigg's public defender, Mitchell Ahnstedt, argued for closing the February 22 hearing because of 'massive and pervasive' media coverage of the case.

Prosecutor Hal Sargent objected, arguing that juries in Jefferson County have fairly tried a number of high profile cases.

Sargent argued: 'I don't think having it (a preliminary hearing) in public will impact having a fair trial.'

Preliminary hearings are where prosecutors present evidence against a suspect, sometimes publicly revealing previously undisclosed information. A judge decides whether to hold a trial or release the suspect.

Police arrested Sigg on October 23. His mother called police and her son turned himself in.

Sargent, the prosecutor, said during the hearing that Sigg had not been a suspect prior to his arrest despite hundreds of police scouring the neighborhood and collecting cheek swabs for DNA.

Sigg, who turns 18 next month, was charged as an adult and is being held in an adult jail.

The original charges included four counts of murder, two counts of kidnapping, and one count each of sexual assault on a child and robbery in Jessica's abduction and slaying.

He was also charged with attempted murder, attempted sexual assault and attempted second-degree kidnapping in the attack on the runner and with six counts of crime of violence.

If convicted as an adult, Sigg faces up to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years.

Prosecutors said he confessed to kidnapping and killing Jessica and attacking the jogger. It's not clear if he has made any comment on the charge of sexually assaulting the girl.

The judge issued several orders in the case, including the preservation of evidence and investigator notes and emails sent between prosecutors and law enforcement.

Munsinger also barred prosecutors from using the jail's electronic record keeping system to keep track of his defense team's visits to the jail or to get updates on Sigg's medical and mental condition. He granted the request after public defender Katherine Spengler raised concerns that such tracking has happened in other cases.

The next hearing in the case will be February 8.
