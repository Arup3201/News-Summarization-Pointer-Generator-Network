Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time with their children, saying: ‘You can’t be a great mum and keep working all the time.’

The actress recently put her Hollywood career on hold of 12 months to look after her children ... but with a wealth estimated at about £30 million, she is better placed than most to be able to afford the time off.

The 55-year-old said: ‘I wanted to spend more time with my family.

The Love Actually actress - who has a 14-year-old daughter, Gaia (pictured with her), and a 26-year-old adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba - said she had come to the conclusion that it wasn't always possible to juggle parenthood and a career

‘A year off was my birthday present to myself. I didn’t actually act or write. I was just a mum.

‘I taught drama at my daughter’s school, cooked meals and had fun. 

'I highly recommend others to do the same if they can afford it.’

The Love Actually actress – who has a 14-year-old daughter, Gaia, and a 26-year-old adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba – said she had come to the conclusion that it wasn’t always possible to juggle parenthood and a career.

She said: ‘Sometimes in life you’ll have some things, at other times you will have other things.

'You don’t need it all at once, it’s not good for you.

‘Motherhood is a full-time job. 

'The only way I could have continued working would have been by delegating the running  of the home to other people.

'I never wanted to do this as I find motherhood profoundly enjoyable.’

The star who recently played Mary Poppins creator P.L. Travers in Saving Mr Banks, also described her husband Greg Wise as ‘a great aesthetic pleasure’.

She said: ‘He is the only luxury I can’t imagine ever being able to give up.

'Because he can cook, wash up, clean, entertain children, understand maths homework, put up shelves, take them down and put them up elsewhere and repair the little holes left behind, garden with a purpose, drive sensibly but very fast on motorways and let me get on with my life.
