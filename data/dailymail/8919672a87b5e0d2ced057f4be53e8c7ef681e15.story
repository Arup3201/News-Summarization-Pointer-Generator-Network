Legendary paparazzi photographer Ron Galella is releasing a book featuring hundreds of iconic images of celebrities such as Jackie O, Michael Jackson, Andy Warhol and Brigette Bardot.

He was dubbed the 'paparazzo extraordinaire' by Newsweek - a name that has become the title of his new book, released this month.

Whether it was snapping Michael Jackson and Brooke Shields at the Shrine Auditorium in 1984, Jackie O without her sunglasses on, or Brigitte Bardot in a bikini in St-Tropez, the now 81-year-old was the pioneer of high-stakes, stake-out paparazzi photography, which ultimately lead to the former First Lady filing a restraining order against him.

King of Paparazzi: Following Jackie O (right) around New York's Upper East Side for years, Ron Galella (inset) was eventually ordered to stay 50 yards away from her, but still captured some of her most iconic images

Following Onassis around New York's 
Upper East Side for years, he jumped out of bushes as she cycled in 
Central Park, hovered around her tennis matches and even followed her to
Greece, where he dressed up as a Greek sailor in order to snap pictures
of her in a bikini.

She eventually pressed charges 
against him, and he was forced to stay 100 yards from her home and 50 
yards away from her and her children.

Mr Galella snapped his now iconic photographs using his ability to outsmart stars, capturing them at the perfect moment by popping out of a bush, jumping from around a corner, or hanging out the window of a taxi.

Stealth and precision: Mr Galella snapped his now iconic photographs by outsmarting stars, by popping out of a bush, jumping from around a corner, or hanging out the window of a taxi

Biggest fan: Andy Warhol famously called Ron Galella his favourite photographer, after the artist explained, 'My idea of a good picture is one that's in focus and of a famous person doing something unfamous'

When he photographed Greta Garbo in 
1978 leaving New York's Rizzoli bookstore, the photographer hid in a 
phone booth down the block.

He then jumped out to take her picture, 
according to The Daily Beast.

Superstars: Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton were also snapped by the famed photographer

Celebrity following: Mr Saturday Night fever, John Travolta, was also captured by the photographer's lens

His book Paparazzo Extraordinaire is a 
collection of his greatest hits, showing old-Hollywood stars in various 
surprised moments that have ultimately helped to define the public's
perception of them today.

The book also includes an accompanying essay arguing that his often 
provocative method mixed with his innate eye resulted in aesthetically 
superior images to the paparazzi shots flooding today's media.

Although
the photographer has since retired from the paparazzi game, he will be 
attending the Metropolitan Museum of Artâ€™s Costume Institute Gala on May
7 to take pictures of the fashion world's elite.

He will be next to a mosh-pit of other 
screaming paparazzi, but said he will reignite his famous focus and stealth, with his eyes set on Taylor 
Swift: 'I hope she shows up, he said.

Paparazzo Extraordinaire, published 
by German publisher Hatje Cantz, features images of Frank Sinatra, 
Micheal Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor, Brigette Bardot, Mick Jagger, John 
Lennon, John Travolta and Andy Warhol.

Mr
Galella was also the subject of a documentary in 2010, Smash His 
Camera.

It chronicled some of his greatest stake-out stories and 
most-prized photographs.
