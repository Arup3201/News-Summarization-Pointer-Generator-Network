Thousands of police officers who retire at 50 are walking into well-paid civilian jobs at their old stations while also enjoying generous pensions.

Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that at least 3,600 former constables, sergeants and inspectors are ‘double-dipping’ after leaving the front line while still relatively young then going back to work in the same forces.

They can take up their new positions just weeks after retiring with a tax-free cash lump sum and an annual pension averaging £15,000.

Altogether, they are earning a total of £73 million a year by becoming chauffeurs, call handlers, receptionists, crime-scene technicians and even dog kennel assistants.

Senior officers have also retired to take on top posts. They include Andy Trotter, a former deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard who now runs the British Transport Police, and Sir Ian Johnston, another former Met chief who became Director of Security and Resilience for the Olympics.

But the widespread practice is under threat as the Government forces through plans to raise the normal pension age to 60 for police officers, in line with other public-sector workers.

Edward Boyd, a Research Fellow at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: ‘Police officers remain extremely employable even after the average retirement age of 50.

'Given this, and in the absence of evidence that police officers have a lower life expectancy than the general population, raising the pension age to 60 would be a sensible approach to make policing more affordable in these straitened times.’

'Double-dip: Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers' Alliance says police officers should continue to draw a salary or their pensions, not both

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Police officers retiring must either claim their pension or a salary if they continue to work for the force.

'They shouldn’t be allowed to double dip and do both at taxpayers’ expense.’

The majority of the 134,000 police officers in England and Wales are members of an old pension scheme that means they can retire by 50 if they have served for 30 years.

They are entitled to a pension worth two-thirds of their final salary and a lump sum.

Those who joined after 2006 must wait until 55 to retire and receive half of their final salary.

Home Secretary Theresa May wants to raise the pension age to 60 and increase officers’ contributions as part of a wider shake-up of pay and conditions.

These changes are being fiercely resisted.

Police say early retirement ages are justified because of the physical demands and risks involved in fighting crime, and that the public would not be kept safe by unfit or older officers.

Clint Elliott of the National Association of Retired Police Officers said: ‘Our argument has always been that it should be the best person for the job. I don’t see any reason why police officers’ employment opportunities should be restricted.’
