BBC chairman Lord Patten was under fire last night after blocking the release of a secret report on a disastrous £100 million IT project.

Auditors are expected to release a devastating report this week on the BBC’s botched Digital Media Initiative (DMI), which was scrapped in May.

A review by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) is expected to be sharply critical of the BBC’s management of the project, which was meant to digitise the BBC’s archives.

Lord Patten has allegedly vetoed the release of the report under Freedom of Information laws, saying its publication would be likely to 'inhibit the free and frank provision of advice from BBC staff to senior managers'

But is has also emerged that Lord Patten has frustrated attempts to get to the bottom of exactly how much the BBC’s senior management knew about the project.

Minutes of a meeting of the BBC’s executive board in June 2011 show that the board discussed a report on the progress of the initiative.

But the Guardian yesterday reported that Lord Patten has vetoed the release of the report under Freedom of Information laws, saying its publication would be likely to ‘inhibit the free and frank provision of advice from BBC staff to senior managers’.

Criticism: Tory MP Rob Wilson said Lord Patten was making a 
'dreadful mistake' in trying to cover up the BBC's mistakes

Tory MP Rob Wilson last night said Lord Patten was making a ‘dreadful mistake’ in trying to cover up the BBC’s mistakes rather than opening them up to scrutiny.

Mr Wilson said: ‘It is no surprise that a report from PWC criticises the BBC’s system of governance, as the past year’s events have shown there is very little real leadership and management taking place at the most senior levels.

‘Lord Patten is once again making the dreadful mistake of hiding the truth and failing to expose the BBC to any form of openness and transparency.

One wonders how much more management failures the ordinary, hardworking and decent members of BBC staff can take.’

The
 revelation comes just days after the Commons public accounts committee 
warned that the BBC’s leadership system was ‘broken’. MPs accused the 
BBC management of a ‘culture of cronyism’ in a damning report on the 
huge pay-offs handed to senior figures.

The
 secret 2011 report on the DMI is potentially embarrassing for the BBC, 
which did not finally abandon the initiative until May this year, when 
it was scrapped by Lord Hall in one of his first acts as the 
corporation’s new director-general.

Lord Hall said the project had ‘wasted a huge amount of money’ - estimated at £98.4 million.

At the time he said he had ‘serious concerns’ about the way the scheme had been managed.Whistleblowers have revealed that BBC bosses were told three years ago that the DMI initiative was heading for the rocks.

Senior
 managers were warned in 2010 that the projected £95 million benefits of
 the scheme were ‘hugely optimistic and difficult to deliver’.

Bill
 Garrett, former head of technology in the BBC’s programme making 
department, also wrote to Lord Patten also wrote to Lord Patten 
personally in May 2012 to warn him of ‘serious concerns’ that costs were
 spiralling out of control.

The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was meant to allow BBC staff to access everything in the archive from their computers, doing away with the need for video or audio tapes

But despite the warnings, the project was allowed to continue for years, clocking up millions of pounds of waste.

The DMI, which was dubbed ‘Don’t Mention It’ by BBC staff because of repeated problems, was meant to allow all footage to be recorded digitally, doing away with the need for video and audi tapes.

But it proved so unreliable that traditional tape editing machines had to be installed at the BBC’s headquarters.

The National Audit Office is expected to launch a fresh investigation into the affair following the release of the PWC report.

The Commons public accounts committee is also expected to summon former BBC director-general Mark Thompson to explain why the corporation continued with the project for so long.
