For most travellers, reaching the world’s most extreme locations can be a formidable challenge.

But for 23-year-old Callum Snape, the hard work is just beginning as he arrives at his isolated destinations.

The Canadian photographer sets about capturing the spectacular scenery in the country’s most remote areas.

Callum has shot a series of images during a recent trip to the wild and icy province of Alberta in the Canadian Rockies.

He captured the breathtaking stills using the area’s rugged terrain as a backdrop.

Callum, who works as a freelance photographer and travel blogger, said that some of the locations he visits can take hours, or often days to reach.

Temperature’s in Alberta can drop to as low as -10C during winter.

Each year he spends around six weeks backpacking, working on his spectacular series, which he snaps across Canada.

As the locations he visits are so remote, the trips take anything up to a year to plan.

To take the snaps he either uses a self-timer or a remote controlled device that allows him unlimited time to take portrait shots.

Callum, from Banff in Alberta, Canada, said: ‘The best thing about most of my locations is I have to work really hard to get there.

‘Most of them involve anything from several hours to several days to get to, so the reward is not only the incredible destination but the physical journey to get there.

‘The feeling is overwhelming when I reach my destination - the first thing I do is take my hiking pack off and sit there speechless at the view.

‘I'm more creative when I work alone, so a lot of my trips are solo but every now and then I go with a few other people.

‘A rush of accomplishment, satisfaction, adrenalin and awe takes over and my all body pain and worries disappear instantly.’

Callum, who also runs photography workshops in Canada, added: ‘My work is all reflections of my passions and is layered with mountain landscape, lifestyle, adventure and all things snowy.

‘I have a thirst for knowledge of the great outdoors and learn by climbing the highest summits, descending the lowest canyons, exploring the coldest, most surreal locations that the Canadian Rockies have to offer. 

'I'm an adventurer through and through.’
