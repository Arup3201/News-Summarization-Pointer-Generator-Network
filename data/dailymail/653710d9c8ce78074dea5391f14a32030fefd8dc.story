A couple who appeared on ITV's This Morning to discuss the fact they drink their own urine have become the subject of a Twitter backlash from horrified viewers.

Bex Long and John Dixon say their own home brewed elixir has banished symptoms of depression, made their eyes brighter and their skin clearer.

The couple, who have been dating for two years, told an aghast Holly Willoughby and Dermot O'Leary on ITV's This Morning that their urine was so potent it was 'like an energy drink'.

They also admitted to dabbing it on cuts and burns to help them heal.

At one point they even downed a champagne flute of the liquid live on air, as Holly shielded her eyes with her hands.

But viewers took to Twitter to 
complain that the segment - aired at 10.50am - was too much for morning TV.

One wrote: 'Stomach is churning. Just watched people drink their own urine on This Morning. I physically feel sick. Just want to vomit.'

Another said: 'Do you chill it or drink it straight from the tap?? "Straight 
from the tap" @itvthismorning WHAT AM I WATCHING?

Another added:
 'Can not believe I have just watched a segment on this morning about 
people drinking there own wee. What goes on in some people's minds?'

Disgusted: Some repulsed viewers took to Twitter to complain the piece was 'too much' for morning TV, after Willoughby asked if they drank the liquid 'warm or chilled'

Mr Dixon explained that he has been 
drinking a cup or two of his own urine every day for seven years after a
 friend extolled the virtues of it.

When he met Miss Long two years ago, he introduced her to it - and after finding it relived symptoms of her depression, she has continued with it.

The couple now firmly believe the practice is a key part of staying healthy.

Mr Dixon told the programme that he'd
 started drinking his own urine seven years ago after being 'a naughty 
kid' - and noticed the difference straight away.

He said: 'I found it balanced my head, things were calmer and I could think clearer.'

Miss Long added that when she met him she'd suffered from depression for 10 years and was taking medication for it.Â 

Wanting to come off the tablets, Mr 
Dixon told her about the health benefits he'd discovered from drinking 
his own urine every day.

Happy: Mr Dixon explained he has been drinking a cup or two his own urine every day for seven years after a friend extolled the virtues of it

Doing it together: When Mr Dixon met Miss Long two years ago, he introduced her to 'urine therapy' - and after finding it relived symptoms of her depression, has continued with it

She
 said: 'I spoke to people where John works and heard stories about how 
they had got better [from doing it] and thought I would try it.

'For the first couple of months I felt happy and bouncy - it worked straight away,' she added. 'If I had forgotten to take a tablet then I would do that instead.'

She added that the taste and smell of the urine 'depends on what you've been eating and drinking' - and that it 'definitely wasn't an acquired taste'.

Mr Dixon added: 'It smells and tastes like wee - there's not getting around it. But it cleans you out.

'When you carry on doing it, you can taste what food you eat.'

This was backed up further after the couple knocked back a shot of their urine live on air - with Mr Dixon declaring he could 'taste the coffee' he had just drunk.

Caution: But Dr Ranj Singh (right) warned that 'urine is one of the body's ways of getting rid of stuff - and it could contain toxic byproducts'

And when quizzed by an incredulous Holly Willoughby, the couple admitted they tended not to sip the first 'go' of the day, due to it being 'quite strong'.

And Dr Ranj Singh cautioned against the practice. He warned: 'It's not necessarily recommended. If you are on medication and you are going to come off it, then it's important to talk to a doctor first.

'Urine is one of the body's ways of getting rid of stuff - and it could contain toxic byproducts.

'Yes, it is sterile in the bladder, but once it leaves the bladder it can come into contact with bacteria. if you drink it, you are re-introducing that bacteria back into the body.

Urine therapy is said to date back to the Bible. Historical documents suggest that the Aztecs disinfected wounds with it, while the benefits are also mentioned in Indian and Chinese literature.

Urine is highly sterile, consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. During the digestive process, the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted.

The blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine.

But GP Dr Rob Hicks said: 'Over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine, but as far as I'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back-up these claims.

'The kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body doesn't need, so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive.

'Personally, I believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking, eating a healthy diet, and keeping stress under control.'
