A new father  was burned to death at the wheel of his car when it exploded after a 100mph chase in which he was shot at by three gunmen on mopeds, it emerged today.

The unnamed 32-year-old electrician who died in his sportscar may have been a victim of a failed car-jacking, friends have said. 

He died when his vehicle careered into a bus stop and burst into flames on the Old Kent Road in south London.

Part of the black Audi RS4's engine block was thrown several metres down the carriageway by the force of the explosion.

Tragedy: A 32-year-old man died at the wheel of his car after a high speed chase down the Old Kent Road in south London

Attack: Witnesses said they heard gunshots just before the car crash and friends of the dead man fear it was a car-jacking that led to the death

Witnesses reported shots being fired at the vehicle in the moments leading up to the crash at 2.30am on Sunday morning. 

Devastated friend Donald Homan, 33, was laying flowers at the scene refused to name his pal who he knew since school.

He said 'We can't understand what's happened here, his partner is devastated, they have a ten-week-old baby together and we are all grieving.

'I've been in close contact with his girlfriend, she's obviously very upset, he loved his family and was so happy and proud to be a dad.

'He was an electrician, self employed and worked hard for his family and drove a nice car.

'We are in really deep shock, he was just a really lovely guy, just 32-years-old and we had been friends since school. 

'As for what happened, it's an absolute mystery to us, we don't even know why he was out at that time.

'All can think it was a case of mistaken identity or they could have been trying to steal his car.

'He had nothing criminal about him and a ten-week old baby boy at home and a partner who loved him.'

Carnage: Witnesses described how the incident unfolded like something 'out of a film' when the man died at 2.30am on Sunday

Murder squad detectives appealed for witnesses.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said forensic officers were trying to establish if holes in the vehicle, which had been speeding at up to 100mph, were caused by bullets.

Witnesses said a passer-by tried to pull the victim from the burning car but was beaten back by 12ft flames before it exploded.

They said the driver appeared to be trying to escape three men on mopeds, who reportedly fired at least three shots.

Residents woken by the explosion called 999 and firefighters quickly extinguished the flames, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Residents of the Avondale Square Estate where the car crashed said bystanders tried to rescue the driver from the burning sports car. 

'There was a huge bang and the screeching sound of metal on metal,' said one resident who preferred not to be named. 

'At first we thought it was something to do with the storms, but there was a huge woosh straight after as the car went up in flames.

'We called the fire brigade and they were here in five or ten minutes, but even if the station was 200 yards away they wouldn't have stood a chance.

'Our kids were hysterical, the fireball was so immense half the tree was on fire.

'There was nothing that could be done for him, there were passers-by who tried to help. I watched a guy trying to open the passenger side door but it was blistering hot and he was pushed back, a woman with him was screaming "there's someone in there."

'It was horrific, whoever was in there either died on impact or very quickly afterwards.

'There were a few explosions and bangs go off before the fire brigade arrived and the flames were out quickly, but it was too late.

The father-of-three continued: 'In the light you could see absolute devastation. There was debris strewn all over the green.

'The motor was metres from the car itself, it must've been thrown out in the crash or blown out by an explosion.

'You couldn't even recognise the car. It was just a melted lump about waist height.'

Another resident of the block of flats told how the car burst into flames just yards from her home.

Margaret Tompkins, 67, said: 'It was like a war zone, frightening. It was a very loud bang which I assumed afterwards was an explosion - it could have been anything on the Old Kent Road.

'It happened so close and it could've been so much worse for us.

'As the day went on we saw forensics searching every little inch. I saw the car, what was left of it. It didn't look like a car at all - it looked like when they crush motors in those yards.

'It looked horrific. Absolutely horrific.' 

After the crash Old Kent Road was closed between Burgess Park and Rotherhithe New Road in south Bermondsey. No arrests have been made and a post-mortem examination will take place today.

Detective Inspector Dave Reid, who is leading the inquiry, said : 'At this stage our forensic team are working to establish the cause of the holes that were found in the car that had crashed.

'One line of enquiry, which we are unable to confirm until those tests are complete, is that the holes were caused by shots being fired at the car.

'I would appeal for anyone who saw a Black Audi RS4 car being driven early that morning around that area or along the Old Kent Road to contact us.'
