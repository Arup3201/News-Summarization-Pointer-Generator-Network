It is the bane of every household – and following a ruling by Brussels bureaucrats it is about to get worse.

Home owners will find their armoury in the battle against dust and dirt weakened by a ban on powerful vacuum cleaners.

Under European Commission ‘eco’ rules that will come into force next September, the power of new vacuum cleaners must not exceed 1,600 watts.

Under threat: The 2,300W Hoover Dust Manager (left), which will be outlawed by new EU regulationsand the Vax U90-MA-R (right), which outsells its rivals on Amazon.co.uk

That figure will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017. Current cleaners boast an average of 1,800 watts.

The
 move angered manufacturers, who say it will do nothing to make cleaners
 more environmentally friendly and will simply reduce efficiency in the 
home.

Justin Binks, director
 of Sebo UK, which produces a range of vacuum cleaners, said the 
regulations would limit performance using ‘unrealistic criteria’.

‘If
 the proposed regulations come into force as planned next year, they 
could hugely frustrate anyone trying to clean their home,’ he said.

Critics
 say cleaners satisfying the new rule may use less power, but 
householders will have to use them for longer so they are likely to use 
the same amount of electricity in the long run.

European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso says the new rules will save energy equivalent to that produced by four nuclear power stations

Here are five of top selling vacuum cleaners on Amazon.co.uk that will be banned when new regulations come in

1. Numatic HVR200A Henry A1 Bagged Cylinder Vacuum Cleaner. 1,200W.

BANNED BY 2017

2. Vax W90-RU-P Rapide Ultra 2 Pre-Treatment Upright Carpet and Upholstery Washer. 1,000W.

BANNED BY 2017

3. Vax U90-MA-R Air Reach Multicyclonic Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner. 1,200W.

BANNED BY 2017

4. Sebo X4EXTRA Automatic Upright Vacuum Cleaner. 1,300W.

5. Hoover Smart Pets SM1901 Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner. 1,900W.

BANNED BY NEXT SEPTEMBER

Under
 the regulations, appliances will be rated from A to G depending on how 
much noise they make, the energy efficiency of their suction and the 
levels of dust pumped out by their ‘exhaust air’. Similar labels are 
already displayed on washing machines.

Despite
 his company not producing any vacuum over 1,400 watts, Sir James Dyson,
 the billionaire entrepreneur who pioneered ‘bagless’ vacuums, is also 
angered by the proposal.

He 
says the eco-labels will be misleading because they will not take into 
account the cost and waste of vacuum bags and filters and will give an 
advantage to competitors who use ‘bag’ technology. He is seeking a 
judicial review of the proposal at the European Court of Justice.

The new measures will be extended to other appliances, including water pumps, water heaters and tumble dryers.

The Brussels bureaucrats have also angered British farmers with changes to meat labelling.

Meat and poultry is currently labelled with information about where the animal was born, reared and slaughtered.

But
 in a proposal to deal with the trade in animals raised in one country 
and fattened for market in another, they will be required to spend only a
 few weeks in the UK for the meat to be labelled British.

UK farmers fear the new rules may trigger imports of cheap chickens from former Eastern Bloc countries.
