Andreas Lubitz's fear that he was going blind - thought to be the reason for him deliberately crashing the Germanwings jet - may have just been in his head, it emerged today.

The killer pilot had reportedly been living 'on the edge' because he feared his deteriorating vision, possibly due to a detached retina, would cost him his pilot's licence.

But investigators now believe his condition was simply a nervous, psychosomatic disorder and not physical at all.

Doctors say the symptoms brought on by stress can be cleared up with rest and therapeutic drugs, raising the harrowing scenario Lubitz needlessly took his own life and those of 149 others.  

An investigator close to the criminal investigation: 'If this is indeed the reason why he killed himself, and all those others, then he may have chosen to die for entirely the wrong reasons.

'He lived for flying and was terrified that he would lose his pilot's licence. In his mind that would have been worse than death.'

Madness: Lubitz was 'on the edge' over his deteriorating eyesight, fearing it would cost him his pilot's licence

Health issues: Lubitz , 27, pictured masked his true condition from his employers and was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was

Detectives and prosecutors will examine the hitherto sealed medical files of the University Clinic of Dusseldorf to see if his complaint really was all in the mind. 

But these are often linked to psychosomatic disorders. 

The Internet is filled with chatrooms where people who thought they were going blind were relieved to find anxiety, stress and depression behind their problems.

His aunt Brigitte W, today said she was unaware of Lubitz's health problems only knew him as a normal and happy man.

The 79-year-old told Germany's BILD newspaper: 'I knew nothing of mental health problems and eye problems. 

'When we celebrated family celebrations, he was happy. He never spoke of stress at work.

'We were proud of him, that he fulfilled his childhood dream.' 

She added: 'He flew intentionally into that mountain ridge. It is difficult for the family to cope now.' 

It is understood Lubitz complained of blurred vision involving dark spots in front of his eyes, halos and flashes of light, causing him to misjudge distances on occasions. 

It was claimed yesterday that Lubitz was concerned he was losing his eyesight, possibly because of a detached retina - with his vision already restricted to 30 per cent.

The condition causes the thin lining at the back of the eye to detach from blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients - and is often marked by flashes in the eye.

It also emerged today that Lubitz had been treated for 'suicidal tendencies' several years before becoming a pilot and trawled gay porn websites in the days before his death. 

German prosecutors revealed Lubitz had previously received psychotherapy 'with a note about suicidal tendencies' several years ago before he became a pilot.  

Speaking of the complex operation to build a complete psychological profile of Lubitz in the days before the crash, the police source in Dusseldorf told International Business Times that investigators have been trawling through his internet usage.

'We have a team disassembling his computer, and that of his girlfriend, because the information that we received was that he trawled the dark side of the web visiting, among other things, sites containing, suicide themes and sexual perversions,' the source said.

Lubitz was reportedly the subject of gossip about his sexuality after a brief spell working as a flight attendant, and was nicknamed 'Tomato Andy' - a gay slur based on the fact that although many people believe tomatoes to be vegetables, they are actually fruits.

Yesterday, it was revealed by police that Lubitz suffered from a 'severe psychosomatic sickness' that required the care of several neurologists and psychologists. 

Police said they took away a plethora of medicines from his apartment in Dusseldorf and from his parental home in the small Rhineland town of Montabaur.

Police have moved to seize the confidential medical records of the mass killer hitherto protected by labyrinthine privacy laws in Germany. 

They particularly want to know if his blurred vision was a contributing factor to his catastrophic psychological collapse which led him to pilot his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside, killing himself and 149 innocent passengers and crew. 

Yesterday, The Mail  told how investigators believe his eyesight problems - coupled with a breakdown in his relationship with his long-term girlfriend - triggered the 'madness' that ended in mass murder.

Lubitz masked his true condition – described by police as 'severe burnout syndrome' – from his employers.

He was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was. 

Break: Kathrin Goldbach still lived with Lubitz in his Dusseldorf flat (pictured) but was looking for a new place

But police still don't know whether his vision problems, which are understood to have begun several years ago, were caused by his psychological condition or whether, as one officer said, he was in fact 'slowly going blind'.

German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that it was unclear whether Lubitz's vision problems had physical or psychological causes.

Meanwhile, another report in France from Le Figaro claimed Lubitz's vision was at just 30 per cent at the time of the crash, which saw the 27-year-old fly his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside.

It is understood he once planned to marry pretty blonde teacher Kathrin Goldbach, 26, but she called time on his increasingly erratic and controlling behaviour which made her fearful for her own safety during his rages. 

One friend said: 'He tried to order her what to wear, what men she could speak to, even the length of her skirts. He was a control freak of the highest order.'

Another friend added: 'She said he was very kind and attentive, but that he had problems with mood swings. And I think we sensed that she became more fearful over time.'

The break, according to friends, came just weeks ago. She still lived with him but it is understood she was on the lookout for a bachelor-girl flat.

Frantic that he would lose her, Lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two Audi cars. He took delivery of one vehicle just five days before Tuesday's horror. 

His obsessive need to be in charge extended even to fast food. Habib Hassani, who runs a pizza restaurant near Lubitz's Dusseldorf home, said: 'He was extremely particular about pizza toppings. 

'He wasn't interested in what was on the menu. It was often paprika, ham, onion and broccoli. He had to have it his way. He was compulsive about it.'

On Friday, it was revealed that his illness was so chronic that he had multiple sick notes from doctors, including one issued to him for the day of the disaster, discarded and ripped up in his home. 

As his complex and disturbed personality was reconstructed by investigators, the agony of his murder mission struck at the heart of his home town of Montabaur, for ever changed because of the actions of a Jekyll and Hyde figure whose warped personality made him lead two lives.

On the surface, he projected stability, confidence and calm: the cool pilot who turned up at his grandparents' home wearing his crisp Germanwings uniform. 

He was a fanatical runner, and he liked discos, cars, cooking and music. 

But his insecurity demanded constant attention – which led him to betray Kathrin with a five-month fling with a Germanwings stewardess conducted in cheap hotels where they stayed while working.

'He was always seeking assurances about the way he looked and the way he was viewed by others,' said the former lover, identified only as Maria, 26. 

She painted a portrait of a 'tormented and erratic' man who would wake up from nightmares screaming: 'We're going down, we're going down!'

She added: 'He once told me he would do something to change the whole system, that the world would know his name and remember him.'

He lived up to the macabre promise when he smashed his aircraft into a mountainside on Tuesday when the emotional volcano within him finally erupted. 

His mind disorders, despite treatment, could no longer be restrained.

A spokesman for Lufthansa, the parent company of the budget airline, said the carrier was unaware of a psychosomatic or any other illness affecting Lubitz.
