The three will appear at Oldham Magistrates Court, Greater Manchester Police said.

A post-mortem examination revealed that Thomas died as a result of serious head injuries 'consistent with a non-accidental injury', the force said.

In a statement, his family said: 'As a family, we are all truly devastated and deeply shocked by the tragedy we have all suffered and the loss of our little baby boy.

'We are a private family and, as such, we would ask the media allow us time to grieve in peace and come to terms with this tragic situation we have all found ourselves in.

'We are aware that there are numerous stories in circulation at present. However, we would ask that only official police statements given by Greater Manchester Police are taken as factually correct.'

Police were called to the Royal Oldham Hospital at 2.10am last Sunday following reports that a baby had been admitted with severe head injuries.

Thomas was later transferred to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where he died from his injuries.
