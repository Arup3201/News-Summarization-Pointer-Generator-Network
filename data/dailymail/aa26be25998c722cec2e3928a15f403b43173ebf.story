Scientists are in the process of developing a substance that could be used to create everything from armour to smartphone screens.

Nanocellulose, which is made from plant matter that is broken down into tiny pieces, is not only fast and cheap to make, but its creation only requires water, sunshine and time.

Scientists claim that they are close to being able to produce the substance from the Acetobacter xylinum bacteria which is used to produce vinegar.

Is algae the next super-material? Researchers have found a new method to create Nanocellulose, which can be used in everything from body armour to phone screens. Here, a Chinese man sails his boat along the algae-filled coastline of Qingdao, in eastern China's Shandong province.

The substance could be used in a huge range of ways.

It is a vegetable compound so could act as a food bulker or a bandage.

It could also be used in speakers, computers and cigarette filters .

Firms are also experimenting using it in body armour, while others are developing tablet and smartphone screens.

Until recently this bacteria could be used to synthesis nanocellulose but it was not possible to make it sufficiently cheaply for it to be useful commercially.

However, there is now a new process which involves creating a nanocellulose ‘factory’ in which the algae, when given water, sunlight and time, could produce the substance without intervention.

This now means that nanocellulose could be produced in the quantities needed to make it commercially viable.

Professor Malcom Brown of the University of Texas said: ‘If we can complete the final steps, we will have accomplished one of the most important potential agricultural transformations ever.

‘We will have plants that produce nanocellulose abundantly and inexpensively. It can become the raw material for sustainable production of biofuels and many other products.

‘While producing nanocellulose, the algae will absorb carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas linked to global warming.’

Is this the next supermaterial? Nanocellulose is made from plant matter that is broken into tiny pieces

It has a long history - In
 the 1800s, French scientist Louis Pasteur first discovered that 
vinegar-making bacteria make 'a sort of moist skin, swollen, gelatinous 
and slippery' - a 'skin' now known as bacterial nanocellulose.

Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth, a material, like plastics, consisting of molecules linked together into long chains.

Cellulose makes up tree trunks and branches, corn stalks and cotton fibers, and it is the main component of paper and cardboard.

People eat cellulose in 'dietary fiber,' the indigestible material in fruits and vegetables.

Cows, horses and termites can digest the cellulose in grass, hay and wood.

Most cellulose consists of wood fibers and cell wall remains.

Very few living organisms can actually synthesize and secrete cellulose in its native nanostructure form of microfibrils.

At this level, nanometer-scale fibrils are very hydrophilic and look like jelly.

A nanometer is one-millionth the thickness of a U.S. dime.

Nevertheless, cellulose shares the unique properties of other nanometer-sized materials -- properties much different from large quantities of the same material.

Nanocellulose-based materials can be stronger than steel and stiffer than Kevlar.

Great strength, light weight and other advantages has fostered interest in using it in everything from lightweight armor and ballistic glass to wound dressings and scaffolds for growing replacement organs for transplantation.
