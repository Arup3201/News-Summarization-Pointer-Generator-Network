Development: A local TV station claims the new evidence could have resulted in Casey Anthony's conviction

A bombshell new investigation reveals that a key piece of evidence that could have resulted in the conviction of Casey Anthony for the murder of her two-year-old daughter was missed.

On the last day Caylee Anthony was seen alive, someone searched 'foolproof suffocation' on the Anthonys' home computer, police confirm.

Somehow, investigators never discovered this before the month-and-a-half-long trial last year.

Casey Anthony was acquitted of murder charges in July of last year.

WKMG-TV claims the revelation, which was never brought up by prosecutors in the case, is a new development that 'points right to Casey' and 'could have changed the jury's mind.'

The 'foolproof suffocation' search was known to Anthony's defense attorney Jose Baez, who admitted that he was waiting for the damning evidence to be brought up during the trial.

But Baez told the network that he was 'shocked' when the evidence, which the defense team was planning to pin on Casey's father George Anthony, was never mentioned.

The station claims that prosecutors in the case didn't even know about the suspicious search until reporters brought it to their attention last week.

According to WKMG's timeline of the day Caylee was last seen, Casey was in her parents' home - as confirmed by cell phone pings - when the search was typed in at 2:51pm (which was misspelled as 'suffication').

Seconds later, the user was pointed to a website with writing that suggested: 'Poison yourself and then follow it up with suffocation' by placing 'a plastic bag over the head.'

One minute after that, a MySpace account
was accessed. Casey was the only person in the house who used the 
social networking site.

Sheriff’s Capt Angelo Nieves admitted to WKMG that the investigators may have botched the investigation by not compiling the full browsing history of the day.

'There was an oversight,' Nieves said.

Prosecutors argued that Anthony suffocated Caylee with chloroform, then taped her mouth shut.

Her partially-decomposed body was found in a garbage bag dumped in a swamp on December 11, 2008 - nearly six months after she was left seen alive by her grandparents.

That same day, Casey visited her parents at their home in Orange County, Florida, along with her daughter Caylee.

It was the last time the child was seen alive.

The next day, Caylee went missing and George and Cindy repeatedly asked Casey what had happened to their granddaughter.

Prosecutors tried to convict Casey Anthony using key pieces of information that they claimed proved her guilt in the murder.

It was alleged that that Anthony used chloroform to knock out her daughter Caylee.

While the girl was unconscious, prosecutors said Anthony put duct tape over Caylee’s mouth, which suffocated the toddler.

The word ‘chloroform’ was searched on a computer in the Anthony home 84 times as well as 'neck breaking' and 'household weapons' before the girl's disappearance.

In addition, a police K-9 agent testified that his cadaver dog, Gerus, detected human decomposition in the trunk of Anthony’s car.

Another agent testified that her dog, Bones, had detected human decomposition in the backyard of the Anthony family home.

When she was first questioned by police, Anthony insisted that she had not seen Caylee since she left her in the care of a babysitter, whom she identified as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, a woman who police could never link to the murder.

However, a woman with that name was not involved with Caylee’s disappearance.

That woman is now suing Anthony for defamation, claiming she was fired from her job, kicked out of her apartment and subjected to death threats as a result of her questioning.

Finally, on July 15, 2008 - 31 days after that visit - Cindy Anthony called police to report that Caylee had vanished.

On March 17, 2008 - months before the
toddler's disappearance - chloroform, neck-breaking, head injuries, 
ruptured spleen, chest trauma, inhalation and internal bleeding, were 
all searched in either Google on Wikipedia on the family computer.

The
fragmented search results were recovered from the hard drive, even 
though the computer's internet browsing history had been deleted.

The
search for 'chloroform,' typed in 84 times before Caylee's 
disappearance, became a key piece of the prosecution's case - brought 
up during opening statements and several times during the trial.

Cindy
Anthony claimed she was the one who had searched for the word, saying 
that she thought her dog was being poisoned by eating bamboo leaves from
the garden.

She said the 
initial search was for 'chlorophyll,' Cindy said she later found herself
searching for information on the toxic chemical.

Prosecutors later proved the Cindy was at work when most of the searches took place.

Chloroform vapors can knock even healthy adults unconscious when they are inhaled. In large doses, the gas can be fatal.

'There is something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car,' she told a 911 operator.

It is unknown how detectives missed that key piece of evidence.

Other searches on the Anthonys' computer had been introduced into evidence.

Baez rejected the report as an example of 'the standard anti-Casey spin.'

He told the Orlando Sentinel that any revelations coming from the WKMG report are '100 per cent false.'

Concerned: George and Cindy Anthony last saw their granddaughter on June 16, 2008 - the day she came to visit with Casey

Tragedy: Caylee's body was found in December 2008 - about six months after she was last seen. Her mother Casey was the prime suspect in her death
