George Osborne announced plans to fast-track Chinese visa applications during a visit to the country

Visa applications by wealthy Chinese businessmen and tourists are to be fast-tracked as part of a charm offensive designed to attract billions of pounds of investment.

The move was announced by Chancellor George Osborne, who is on a week-long tour of China aimed at drumming up trade.

This week’s visit comes amid signs of a thaw in relations with Beijing, which have been in deep freeze since David Cameron met the Dalai Lama in London last year.

Mr Osborne is in China at the same time as London Mayor Boris Johnson, who arrived in Beijing for a six-day trade visit yesterday.

The visa decision comes despite reservations from Home Secretary Theresa May, who warned last year that relaxing rules could pose a threat to national security.

The changes will reduce the need for Chinese visitors to the European Union to submit separate visa applications for Britain.

Selected Chinese travel agents will be able to apply for UK visas by submitting just the visa form for entry to the EU’s Schengen area, of which Britain is not part.

A new 24-hour 'super priority' visa 
service will become available from next summer next year, while 
officials are also looking at expanding a VIP mobile visa service, 
currently operating in Beijing and Shanghai, to the whole country.

The
service involves visa teams going out to applicants to collect their 
completed forms and biometric data, with the whole process taking less 
than five minutes.

In 2012, 210,000 visas were issued to visiting Chinese nationals who went on to contribute around £300million to the economy.

The Government has a target of trebling the number of Chinese tourists coming to Britain by 2015.

Mr Osborne, said: ‘These changes will streamline and simplify the process, while ensuring the system is strong and secure. This is good news for business and tourism.’

The move will be welcomed by 
businesses in the UK who have complained that the existing regime is 
discouraging high-spending Chinese visitors from coming to Britain.

In a sign of the changing balance of power in Britain's relations with China, neither the Chancellor nor the London Mayor is expected to raise the country's abysmal human rights record.

In an interview with Sky News yesterday Mr Johnson refused five times to discuss human rights in China, or the status of the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibet.

Mr Osborne also announced details of an £800million Chinese investment in the revamp of Manchester Airport. Pictured, a graphic showing how the airport would look

Mr Johnson, normally no stranger to controversy, said: 'It's not my job as Mayor to insert myself into controversial areas of international dispute.'

Aides to the Chancellor also confirmed he has no plans to raise the human rights issue - a stance which will anger campaigners on the issue.

Mr Osborne also announced details of an £800million Chinese investment in the revamp of Manchester Airport Later this week, ministers are expected to confirm billions of pounds of Chinese investment in a new generation of nuclear power stations in Britain.
