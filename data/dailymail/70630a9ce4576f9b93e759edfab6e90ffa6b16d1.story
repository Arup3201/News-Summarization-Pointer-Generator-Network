A BBC reporter was given the surprise of his life when he unknowingly interviewed a former Liverpool footballer about a match he had played in.

Reporter Stuart Flinders was out on the streets of Liverpool asking members of the public whether they remembered the 1967 Merseyside derby.

A heart-warming interview followed as he asked one man whether he had any recollection of the game, only to find out he had played in the match.

The 74-year-old man turned out to be none other than former Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence who made more than 300 appearances for the club.

Flinders asked: 'I'm just wondering whether you remember the derby match in 1967 at Goodison, FA cup, fifth round, and it was shown on a big screen at Anfield at the same time. Do you remember it?'

'That's right', Mr Lawrence said, nodding. 'Yeah I do, I played in it. I was goalkeeper for Liverpool.'

'It was a great game,' he added, 'Alan Ball scored the winner.'
