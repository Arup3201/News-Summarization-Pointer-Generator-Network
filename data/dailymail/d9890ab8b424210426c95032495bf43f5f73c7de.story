'I never read any of the first 
editions. If I wanted to, I would go out and buy a paperback version,' says collector

A pensioner who did not touch his precious library of rare books for 30 years is to be rewarded for his patience when it sells for an expected £1million at auctioneers Bloomsbury of London later this month.

Clive Hirschhorn, 72, has amassed one of the world’s finest collections of first edition books, which reads more like a Who’s Who of 20th century fiction.

The retired theatre critic, from Midhurst, Sussex, knew the value of the books relied upon the condition of the original dust-jackets and so has hardly removed them from the shelves over the years.

Casino Royale: Set to fetch Mr Hirschhorn £10,000-£15,000 at auction at the end of the month

Rare edition: Harper Lee's To Kill A Mocking Bird is expected to sell for £1,000-£1,500

Nice catch: Catcher in the Rye should be worth £4,000-£6,000

If he wanted to read one, he bought a paper back version as the slightest blemish or tear on the jackets would have knocked hundreds of pounds off their price.

Mr Hirschhorn has now decided to part with his collection of about 500 books that he bought from second-hand shops and private dealers around the world.

A first edition copy of the literary classic The Great Gatsby he paid £1,500 for in 1987 is being tipped to sell for a staggering £75,000.

One of the earliest versions of Ian Fleming’s first James Bond novel Casino Royale that still has a first-issue dust-jacket is valued at £15,000.

Great value: F Scott Fitzgerald's classic The Great Gatsby may fetch £75,000

Golden: William Golding's Lord of The Flies is valued at between £8,000-£12,000

Classic: Brighton Rock, by Graham Greene, could be worth as much as £60,000

An excellent copy of Graham Greene’s book Brighton Rock that has a ‘near-fine’ jacket has a pre-sale estimate of £60,000. First editions of this book are extremely rare as a warehouse fire destroyed most of them in 1938.

Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon is set to sell for £50,000 while a first edition of William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies is valued at £12,000.

King's speech: Author Stephen King has signed the book for Mr Hirschhorn, saying 'Best wishes, and shine on!'. The book may fetch £1,200-£1,800

The world of crime is represented by a £3,000
 early copy of Agatha Christie’s 1932 work Peril At End House while four
 volumes of AA Milne’s The Christopher Robin Books are expected to fetch
 £10,000.

Mr Hirschhorn managed to get a number of his books signed by the authors, with Stephen King writing ‘shine on’ in the front of a first edition copy of The Shining.

Harper Lee’s classic To Kill A Mocking Bird, John le Carre’s Call For The Dead and Margaret Mitchell’s Gone With The Wind are tipped to sell for a total of £27,000.

Mr Hirschhorn said he stopped collecting about three years ago and is now selling the books to help fund his retirement.

He said: 'I started the collection in 1984 after I read a newspaper article about first edition books while on a bus.

'After that it was like a virus or infection that was in my blood and I couldn’t pass a second-hand bookshop without going in to look for first editions.

'I always had with me a useful price guide telling me how much each book was worth and I would always pay less than that price.

'But with first editions, the condition of the dust-jacket is everything.

'I never read any of the first editions, if I wanted to I would go out and buy a paperback version. Any mark or tear on the jacket would take hundreds or thousands off the value.

'I kept them on shelves in my bedroom well out of the sunlight. As I used to say, they were for show not for blow.

'It is quite extraordinary just how much in value some of them have gone up by.

Going, going, gone: Margaret Mitchell's classic Gone with the Wind is worth £6,000-£8,000

Rare: Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier has been valued at between £3,000-£4,000

The big pay day: Raymond Chandler's American classic The Big Sleep should fetch £8,000

The record for the most expensive printed book sold at auction is a complete first edition of The Birds Of America by John James Audubon (right), which was sold at Sotheby's in London in December 2010 for £7.1m.

A rare first edition copy of the book Ulysses by James Joyce sold for £275,000 in 2009, the highest price recorded for a 20th Century first edition.

'I paid about £1,500 for the Great Gatsby in 1987 which wasn’t an inconsiderable sum at all but it could sell for about £100,000 now.

'It is possibly one of the most iconic of all American novels and was turned into a film three times.'

Mr
 Hirschhorn said it was now costing more and more money to insure his 
library and he hopes to use some of the proceeds to buy a new flat to 
rent out.

One of his smartest investments was paying about £120 pounds for To Kill A Mocking Bird which is now worth 100 times that amount.

Rupert Powell, the deputy chairman of auctioneers Bloomsbury of London, said: 'This is one of the most important private collections of modern first editions to come onto the market the last ten years.

'A particularly remarkable aspect is the near-perfect condition of the original dust-jackets, and this will appeal to all true collectors.'

Other rare first editions in the sale include Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell To Arms, Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca and John Steinbeck’s The Grapes Of Wrath and Bram Stoker’s Dracula.

The auction takes place on October 25.
