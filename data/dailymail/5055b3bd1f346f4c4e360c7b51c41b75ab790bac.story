A council has demanded a ban on electronic betting 
machines – dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling – because of the growing
problem of addiction.

Fixed-odds betting terminals allow punters to use debit cards and gamble
up to £300 a minute – more than four times faster than casinos’ rate of
play.

According to recent research, bookmakers are becoming increasingly reliant on them for revenue, with 80 per cent of their turnover coming from the machines.

Money sink: Punters can lose up to £300 per minute on fixed-odds betting machines

Now Liverpool City Council warns people are losing their jobs and homes and turning to loan sharks and crime because they’re hooked on the high-stake, high-speed casino-style games.

Last year, an estimated £607million was gambled on the 559 fixed-odds terminals in bookmakers across Liverpool – £1,302 for every man, woman and child in the city.

Unlike fruit machines, where cash stakes are limited to £2, gamblers can use their debit cards to lose up to £100 every 20 seconds - more than four times as fast as the rate of play in casinos.

The machines, which are highly addictive and have been dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of the gambling world, lead to crime and poverty, say critics.

But the gambling industry claims there is no hard evidence that electronic roulette games are dangerous and instead have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes.

Nick Small, the Labour councillor who tabled the motion, said: ‘At the moment we (Liverpool) haven’t got the power to ban these high speed, high stake machines ourselves, but we want the Government to outlaw them, or at the very least give us the power to try to stop their proliferation and bring the rate of play and maximum stake right down.

‘At the moment people can lose £300 a minute and £607million was gambled on these machines in our city alone last year - that’s a staggering amount.

‘I’ve heard stories of ordinary people, doing ordinary jobs, who are going into the bookies on pay day and losing a whole month’s salary or wages in one session.

‘These machines are causing real problems in Liverpool. People are losing their jobs, their relationships are breaking down, they are losing their homes, turning to loan sharks or payday loan firms and even committing crimes because of gambling.

‘Those who say this isn’t a problem should listen to these stories and they will see for themselves that self-regulation isn’t working. Liverpool’s vote is about localism - we need new powers to stop the FOTBs.’

Big draw: Ladbrokes has said that FOBTs account for around 80 per cent of its turnover

According to recent research, bookmakers are becoming increasingly reliant on FOBT for revenue, with more than 80 per cent of their turnover coming from such machines, compared to 20 per cent from traditional over the counter horse racing and sports betting.

Ladbrokes announced that £5.9billion was staked on these machines from January to June last year, compared with only £1.2billion for over-the-counter bets.

According to the Gambling Commission, there are now more than 33,000 FOBTs in the UK each generating an average weekly profit last year of £825 - up from £760 in 2011.

But although the Prime Minister has vowed to ‘have a proper look’ at FOBTs, which have been banned in Ireland and are much more tightly regulated across Europe, the Government has so far refused to act.

Last month Culture Minister Maria Miller announced that, following a review, she had rejected calls to cut the maximum stake on electronic roulette machines.

In a report, the culture department admitted the ‘potential for harm’ among players using fixed odds terminals was ‘high’, but said it was ‘not clear how great an impact a reduction would have on gambling-related harm’.

Derek Webb, founder of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: ‘FOBTs have been a hidden problem for the last 10 years, but the scale of the problems created by these machines is becoming more exposed by the day.

‘I commend the action of Liverpool council in demanding a ban, or at the very least, more powers. Betting shops are no longer about traditional race and sports betting, they are now driven by high speed, high stake, addictive gaming machines that should have no place on the high street.’
