If you go down to the woods today you could be in for a big surprise - if you encounter somebody using one of these sleeping bags to go camping in.

Made in the shape of a brown bear, the sleeping bag is over 7ft long, weighs 12lb (5.5kg) and costs a staggering £1,400.

The unique piece of equipment is made using artificial fur, a handmade plastic nose, imitation leather and polyester.

Designer Eiko Ishizawa from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, was inspired after a wild bear was spotted for the first time in Bavaria, Germany, in 170 years.

The 32-year-old said: 'The news was about a wild bear which appeared in the mountains for the first time in 170 years.

'The bear came from Italy but started to wander and ended up making its way into neighbouring countries.

The bag was created after Ishizawa read an article about the first bear being found in Bavaria for 170 years

'This incident evoked a huge debate and in the end, it was decided that the bear was to be hunted down.

'I became interested in this tragic story and decided to create a giant sculpture of the giant bear.'

After creating the sculpture, the artist then wanted to make it on a larger scale and produced the fascinating sleeping bags.
