New Orleans police have identified a suspect in the mass shooting at a Mother's Day Parade that left 19 wounded, including two children.

The police said Akein Scott, 19, is being sought in the crime and they had executed search warrants at three locations Monday evening but the teenage suspect remains at large.

'We are coming to find him. We will find him,' said New Orleans Police Supt. Ronal Serpas.

Wanted: Akein Scott is wanted for allegedly shooting 19 people, including two children, during Mother's Day Parade in New Orleans

More than one witness had positively identified Scott as the shooter, Serpas said, according to a local television station.

Scott has two previous arrests, one for illegal possession of a stolen firearm and another for resisting an officer, illegally carrying 
weapons, possession of heroin and illegal possession of stolen firearms 
and illegally carrying weapons with controlled dangerous substance.

For the first arrest, the district attorney declined to prosecute and on the second case, all charges were dropped except carrying a weapon, for which he was indicted on April 22 of this year.

He is due back in court on that charge on Thursday.

Scott allegedly unleashed the carnage Sunday afternoon, which was caught on surveillance footage.

The grainy footage shows a crowd suddenly scattering in 
all directions, with some falling to the ground, in a scene of confusion and chaos.

They appear to be 
running from a man, who is wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, who turns and runs out of the picture. The image isn't clear but police
say they hope someone will recognize him and notify investigators.

The shooting - described by the FBI as a flare-up of street violence - shattered the festive mood surrounding the parade that drew hundreds of people to the 7th Ward neighborhood of modest row houses not far from the French Quarter.

Cell phone video taken in the aftermath of the shooting shows victims lying on the ground, blood on the pavement and others bending over to comfort them.

At least three of the victims were seriously wounded. Of the rest, many were grazed and authorities said that overall most wounds were not life threatening. No deaths were reported.

The victims included 10 men, seven women, a boy and a girl. The children, both 10-years-old, were grazed and in good condition.

Police vowed to solve Sunday's shooting but said it was not initially clear if particular people in the parade were targeted, or if the shots were fired at random.

'We'll get them,' Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas said. 'We have good resources in this neighborhood.'

Mayor Mitch Landrieu urged witnesses 
to come forward with information during a news conference Sunday night 
at a hospital where gunshot victims were taken.

'These kinds of incidents will not go 
unanswered. Somebody knows something. The way to stop this violence is 
for you all to help,' he said.

Mary Beth Romig, a spokeswoman for the
FBI in New Orleans, said federal investigators have no indication that 
the shooting was an act of terrorism.

Commotion: This image shows the moment police arrived on the scene. One officer described it as 'simply an act of street violence'

'It's strictly an act of street violence in New Orleans,' she said.

As many as 400 people came out for 
the second-line procession - a boisterous New Orleans tradition - though
only half that many were in the immediate vicinity of the shooting, 
said Serpas.

Officers were interspersed with the marchers, which is routine for such events.

Police saw three suspects running from the scene. No arrests had been made as of early evening.

One suspect was videoing the parade and captured some of the chaos as he fell to the ground when the shooting started.

No suspects were in custody and police are still looking for leads in connection with the shooting, which took place around 2pm. Police believe there was more than one shooter

New Orleans Police Department Supt. Ronal Serpas said: 'Maybe two different types of weapons. Immediately after the shots were fired, our officers saw three people running away on Frenchmen toward Claiborne

Outside the hospital on Sunday night, 
Leonard Temple became teary as he talked about a friend who was in 
surgery after being shot three times during the parade. Temple was told 
the man was hit while trying to push his own daughter out of the way.

'People were just hanging out. We were
just chilling. And this happened. Bad things always happen to good 
people,' said Temple, who was at the parade but didn't see the 
shootings.

In the late afternoon, the scene was taped off and police had placed bullet casing markers in at least 10 spots.

Second-line parades are loose processions in which people dance down the street, often following behind a brass band.

They can be planned events or 
impromptu offshoots of other celebrations. They trace their origins to 
the city's famous jazz funerals.

A social club called The Original Big 7
organized Sunday's event. The group was founded in 1996 at the Saint 
Bernard housing projects, according to its MySpace page.

The neighborhood where the shooting happened is a mix of low-income and middle-class row houses, some boarded up. 

As of last year, the 7th Ward's population was about 60 per cent of its pre-Hurricane Katrina level.

The crime scene was about 1.5 miles 
from the heart of the French Quarter and near the Treme neighborhood, 
which has been the centerpiece for the HBO TV series 'Treme.'

Sunday's violence comes at a time when
the city is struggling to pay for tens of millions of dollars required 
under a federal consent decree to reform the police department and the 
city jail.

Shootings at parades and neighborhood
celebrations have become more common in recent years as the city has 
struggled with street crime.

Earlier this year, four people were 
shot following an argument in the French Quarter during the last weekend
of partying before Mardi Gras. The victims survived, and several 
suspects were eventually arrested.

Police vowed to make swift arrests. 
Serpas said it wasn't clear if particular people in the second line were
targeted, or if the shots were fired at random.

'We'll get them. We have good resources in this neighborhood,' Serpas said.
