'The biggest mistake of my life': Paul Hollywood and his former lover Marcela Valladolid

She hit the headlines for her scandalous affair with Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood.

But now his ex-mistress Marcela Valladolid is celebrating moving on with her life – by announcing she is expecting her second child.

Chef Valladolid, 36, embarked on a fling with Hollywood – dubbed the ‘George Clooney of baking’ – after they co-starred together in a US version of the baking show last year.

He briefly split with wife Alexandra but the pair have since reunited.

Valladolid is now dating top Hollywood agent Phillip Button and took to her Instagram page last week to post a sonogram snap of their unborn child saying: ‘Good morning, world, what’s happening out there?’

Valladolid has a ten-year-old son Fausto from a previous marriage.

She confirmed her happy news in a statement, saying: ‘Fau asks daily about the gender of the baby and has already picked out names for both a brother and a sister.

‘He’s been asking for a really long time for a baby brother or sister and is thrilled it’s finally happening.’

Hollywood called the affair ‘the biggest mistake of my life.’

Hollywood co-hosted The American Baking Competition with Marcela Valladolid and ended up having an affair with her. The pair no longer speak and Hollywood went back to his wife

He met Valladolid in March 2013 when they co-hosted The American Baking Competition, which was cancelled after just one series due to low ratings. The pair enjoyed holidays in Europe together before splitting. Hollywood then returned to his wife of 15 years and their son, Josh.

Afterwards he told BBC Radio host Richard Bacon: ‘I did have an affair with my co-judge. It’s something which was the biggest mistake of my life because, actually, I still love my wife.’

A family friend of Valladolid said: ‘Marcela and Paul no longer speak. She doesn’t talk about what happened last year. She doesn’t want the scandal rearing it’s head again. She is with a new man, is happy and has moved on.’

Hollywood has enjoyed record ratings for the latest series of The Great British Bake Off, which drew to a close earlier this month.
