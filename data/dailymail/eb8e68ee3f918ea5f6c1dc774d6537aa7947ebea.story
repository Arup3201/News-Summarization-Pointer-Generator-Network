TV personality Millie Mackintosh has attempted to defend her recent selfie which caused uproar after husband Professor Green joked she was a ‘thinspiration’.

The former Made In Chelsea star claimed she was surprised that her rapper partner’s comments had been taken out of context and it wouldn’t stop her from posting nearly nude pictures again in the future.

Speaking during a phone interview on Loose Women on Thursday she said of the picture which showed her looking slim in her underwear: ‘I am surprised that it’s been taken out of context. I think I look healthy in the picture.

picture which she posted online. Her husband quickly joked that she was a 'thinspiration' - a term favoured by followers of pro-anorexia websites

‘I know that I look slim but I think you can see I’ve got muscle definition. I think if I was putting pictures up of my ribs sticking out and bones showing like I looked unhealthily thin, then I’d say of course I was being irresponsible.’

The Quality Street heiress insisted: ‘I think anyone that looked at that picture would not say I was anorexic or looked anorexic.’

Explaining to panellists Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Jane Moore and Myleene Klass her reasons for posting the selfie, she said: ‘I was there for a photoshoot doing a swimwear shoot and I was feeling really proud of my body as I’ve been working out really hard to feel really good on the day and I don’t promote unhealthy dieting.

‘I’m really into the gym and a healthy lifestyle and I am always promoting that on my twitter and instagram. If you generally follow my instagram you’ll see that I am constantly hashtagging ‘strong not skinny’, posting loads of food pictures.’

Asked by the panel why husband Professor Green had used the term ‘thinspiration’ to comment on the picture, she insisted: ‘He was clearly taking the mickey out of me for posting the picture of myself nearly naked. I’m obviously not his thinspiration.’

And when asked if would think twice about posting bikini or underwear pictures in future, she defiantly answered:  ‘I will keep sharing my fitness and workout tips but I am still going to be spreading the message that this isn’t about being skinny, it’s about being strong and healthy and I’m actually going to put up a blog post today.’

Her husbands comment and the term ‘thinspiration’, which is favoured by followers of pro-anorexia websites, provoked a backlash from anorexia campaigners.

Miss Mackintosh, who regularly shares images of herself training at a gym, replied ‘fitspiration!’

Experts on Wednesday accused the pair of encouraging young girls to starve themselves.

Dozens of Twitter users immediately echoed Professor Green’s comments with one writing: ‘I need Millie Mackintosh’s figure #thinspiration,’ while another wrote: ‘Millie Mackintosh is my thinspiration, absolute worldie #girlcrush.’

Many said they were heading for the gym after seeing the image, or embarking on a diet, and begged Miss Mackintosh to share her slimming secrets.

Miss Mackintosh, 24,  joins a growing number of celebrities including Victoria Beckham, model Miranda Kerr and TV presenter Alexa Chung who have become part of a trend dubbed ‘thin-stagram’ whereby they post pictures on Instagram in which they appear worryingly slender.

Many of them have also been labelled ‘thinspiration’ by eating disorder sufferers in the past, who aspire to be just as slim.

On Wednesday a spokesperson from eating disorders charity b-eat said celebrities have a responsibility to think about the body image messages they are sending out.

The spokesperson said:  ‘With the growth of social media sites comes more pressure on individuals to aspire to often unhealthy and even dangerously underweight role models.

Role model: One of the tweets sent in response to the Quality Street heiress' picture. Dozens of Twitter users immediately echoed Professor Green's comments with one writing: 'I need Millie Mackintosh's figure'

Those in the public eye with the opportunity to encourage and influence should remember that they are icons for many young people and think responsibly about the messages they are conveying. 

‘All too 
often we hear of young people damaging their health by trying to emulate
 celebrity role models with the added danger of the possibility of 
developing an eating disorder causing future serious health 
consequences.’

It is not the first time Miss Mackintosh has been dubbed a ‘thinspiration’. In 2012 Nicola Ross wrote on Twitter:

Fitness fanatic: The former Made In Chelsea star frequently posts photos of herself exercising on her Instagram and Twitter accounts. Young girls took to Twitter asking Mackintosh how they could be slim like her

‘Heading to my first gym class again in weeks, please be kind to me. Millie Mackintosh you are my thinspiration.’

Lauren Kinsella posted: ‘I am going to print off pictures of Millie Mackintosh and put them in my room and on the fridge to stop me from eating #thinspiration.’

Miss Mackintosh married Professor Green, whose real name is Stephen Manderson, in September last year at Babington House in Somerset.
