Back in the Swinging Sixties, getting ready was a bit of a chore.

After scrubbing yourself in the bath with a bar of Pears soap, you might have doused yourself in talc, applied your pat-on deodorant and revamped your hairdo with a generous coating of hair lacquer.

These days it seems we’re too busy – and hi-tech – for all that faff, relying on quick-fix dry shampoo to freshen our hair, electric face cleaning brushes to buff our skin and anti-ageing serum to protect it.

Gone are the days when a girl would need hours to preen herself ahead of a big night out, scrubbing in the bath with a bar of Pears soap, applying pat-on deodorant and applying generous coatings of hair lacquer. Today our lives are too busy for all that faff, leaving women to rely on a spritz of dry shampoo and lashings of lip gloss

The contrast between the beauty regimes of women 50 years ago and today has been revealed by cosmetics chain Superdrug, which has marked its half-century by compiling a selection of its best-selling beauty products.

A Rimmel advertisement for ‘beauty on a budget’, which featured in a 1964 edition of Woman magazine, shows how women stocked their bathrooms and dressing tables with cleansing milk, perfumed talc and cologne.

But while we might be saving time on our beauty regimes today, we’re forking out a lot more than our 1960s counterparts did. When Superdrug first opened its doors, the Rimmel products in the advertisement, ranging from block mascara to pat-on deodorant, all cost one shilling and sixpence, or 7.5p in today’s money.

Now you’d have to part with £10.99 for a Max Factor mascara, while a deodorant spray costs £1.

In the 1960s Rimmel’s quaintly named anti-wrinkle cream cost pennies. Today L’Oreal’s Revitalift anti-ageing serum will leave you £14.99 worse off.  Meanwhile hi-tech gadgets such as a sonic face brush for exfoliating the skin would set you back £129.99, while a red light therapy spotlight, which helps reduce blemishes, costs £69.99.

Two other items on today’s  list of essentials that have grown  in popularity since the 1960s include face cleansing wipes and dry shampoo, a fragranced powder used between washes to refresh the hair.

Then there are the products that have stood the test of time.

We still can’t live without make-up essentials such as lipstick, eyeshadow, liquid eyeliner, bronzer and moisturising lotion – although the 1960s packaging and applicators may look rather old-fashioned.

And colour-enhancing shampoo was also on shopping lists 50 years ago.

Yesterday singer Lulu, who shot to stardom in 1964 following the release of her single Shout! kicked off the Superdrug anniversary celebrations.

Recalling how she achieved her wide-eyed 1960s look with mascara, the 65-year-old said: ‘We used to have a dirty block and a little brush and you used to have to spit on the block. It was so unsophisticated. The make-up was harsh and thick.

‘Today there is so much choice when it comes to hair and make-up, even compared to ten or 20 years ago.

'That said, the classics still prevail and there are many names around that I remember buying as a teenager such as Rimmel, Pears soap.’

She added: ‘Teenage girls still have the same problems now as I did then. They still obsess about their looks.

And her own beauty essentials? ‘I always have to have a lip pencil and mascara and a good pair of sunglasses. But as you get older, I’d say that less is more when it comes to make-up,’ she said.
