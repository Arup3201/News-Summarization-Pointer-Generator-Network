Paris Saint-Germain are back in the full flow of pre-season training, with deadly strike duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani going through their paces.

Although Laurent Blanc's men cantered to the French Ligue 1 title last season, they dropped out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage after losing to Chelsea.

Now Ibrahimovic and Cavani will be spearheading a fresh assault on Europe's premier competition.

And Uruguayan hitman Cavani insists he will be around for the challenge, despite interest from Manchester United.

'I am sure to stay, why would I not?' he told L'Equipe while with PSG in Beijing on Thursday morning.

'I'm well in Paris. I have a contract to honour. I'm calm, I'd rather be here. I feel good here. However, I know it does not depend solely on the player but also on the club.'

Cavani finished his first season as both a Ligue 1 champion and a Coupe de la Ligue winner. He scored both goals in the cup final, 2-1 win over Lyon, but throughout the season often found himself playing out wide - supposedly leading to his unhappiness at the club.
