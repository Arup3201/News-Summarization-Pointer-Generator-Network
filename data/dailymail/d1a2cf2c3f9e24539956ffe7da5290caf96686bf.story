A university doctoral student with acute colon cancer and his wife were refused entry on a Delta flight because of his attire, he wrote on his blog. 

On August 18, Arijit Guha, who is working on his PhD at Arizona State University, was at the Buffalo-Niagara Airport with his wife waiting to board his Delta flight.

However, the 31-year-old student said he was told by a Delta agent that his T-shirt which read ‘Bombs ZOMG ZOMG Terrists (sic)’ was making other passengers feel uncomfortable, and he was told he could not board the flight.

Mr Guha, who wrote about the experience on his blog, said ‘Delta Airlines gave in to (sic) the fears of bigots and refused to let me board a flight out of Buffalo-Niagara Airport.’

The experience, he said, began smoothly enough. He and his wife made it through the Transportation Security Administration checkpoint without incident. They were returning back to Arizona after the funeral for his wife’s grandfather.

However, at the gate for Delta flight 1176, Mr Guha said that he was stopped by a Delta agent who said the shirt was making several passengers as well as Delta employees ‘very uncomfortable.’

Mr Guha wrote: ‘I was then questioned by TSA about the significance and meaning of the shirt. I politely explained that it was “mocking the security theatre charade and over-reactions to terrorism by the general public — both of which we're seeing right now, ironically.”

'The agents inquired as to the meaning of the term “ZOMG” (which means Oh My God) and who it was that I thought was “gonna kill us all.”

‘As best I could tell, they seemed to find my explanation that I didn’t think anyone would be killing us all and that I was poking fun at overwrought, irrational fears exhibited by certain members of the flying public to be satisfactory. 

'And moreover, they clearly deemed my shirt to be no legitimate threat.’

The security agent then told him he would need to change his shirt, and that he and his wife would have to go through additional screening ahead of the flight. He and his wife were then re-inspected by three TSA agents, who photographed his shirt and went through their luggage again.

After the inspection, they allowed the couple to proceed.

But by that point, Mr Guha said, the Delta pilot would not allow them on the flight, citing other passenger’s discomfort with the situation.

He said he and his wife had to rent a car and drive four hours to a relative’s house to spend the night, as Delta didn’t offer hotel vouchers.

Arriving at the airport the next morning, Mr Guha had changed his shirt to one that read: ‘Keep Calm and Poop Strong’ with a sketch of the large intestine.

In May, days after the killing of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, two Muslim scholars heading to a conference on American fears of Islam were pulled from a morning flight, and were later told that the pilot had refused to fly with them aboard.

Masudur Rahman, a professor of Arabic at the University of Memphis, and Mohamed Zaghloul, Imam at the Islamic Association of Greater Memphis, were asked to deplane Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight 5452 from Memphis to Charlotte. They were subjected to additional security checks after the plane had pushed back from the gate, Rahman told Reuters by telephone.

After additional screening, the two men were cleared by Delta representatives to re-board the plane, but were then told the pilot would not take them, Rahman said.

Rahman said both men had been cleared for check-in and boarding by airline and Transportation Security Administration officials during normal pre-flight procedures.

According to a TSA spokesman, the decision to remove the two passengers was made by the airline.

Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a regional partner operating as a Delta Connection, apologized for any inconvenience caused, but offered no further explanation.

The flight 'returned to the gate to allow for additional screening of a passenger and the passenger's companion. We take security and safety very seriously, and the event is currently under investigation,' an airline statement said.

The two men were headed to a North American Imams conference where they were scheduled to lead prayers. This year's conference is discussing Islamophobia or fears of Islam and discrimination against American Muslims.

The 31-year-old has battled advanced colon cancer, and apparently selected the shirt as a less-offensive option than the TSA screening one.

Throughout the process, the doctoral student was sharing the ordeal on social media. He wrote on Twitter early in the morning on August 19th: ‘Said @Delta, “it’s not you, it’s the shirt.” Yet changing the shirt wasn’t good enough and the pilot refused to let me board.’

Wrote Mr Guha: ‘In short, security screenings and any other evidence-based assessment method have been deemed irrelevant. Whatever I do, I am suspicious. Why? Not because the shirt I’m wearing presents some sort of legitimate threat…

'Rather, the pilot and some Delta rep can project upon me their worst fears of what I am possibly capable of.  If that’s the case, why even bother with the bloated security apparatus — since Delta pilots have discretion to kick off passengers who've passed multiple checks, after all?’

The shirt, designed by Boing Boing blogger Cory Doctorow, reads in full: ‘Bombs ZOMG ZOMG Terrists (sic) Gonna kill us all ZOMG ZOMG alert level bloodred run take off your shoes moisture’ and shows a picture of an eagle holing a pair of trainers in one talon, and a water bottle in the other.

The description goes on the say that the shirt may be worn to ‘reassure your fellow citizens with a message of anxiety and suspicion,’ but warns the buyer not to wear the shirt to ‘an airport security checkpoint, or anywhere near a secure federal installation.’

Delta spokesperson Betsy Talton told MailOnline that the airline does not discriminate against any of its passengers.

‘We serve thousands of customers around the world,’ she said. ‘Delta does not condone discrimination against anyone, at the same time, providing a safe and secure operation is the primary obligation to its employees and customers.’

Mr Guha cited a landmark 1968 Supreme Court Case, Cohen v. California, in which they found a man wearing a leather jacket which read ‘F*** the Draft’ was protected under free speech.

In the case, the Court found that the man was not conducting him in such a way that that would present a danger to anyone.
