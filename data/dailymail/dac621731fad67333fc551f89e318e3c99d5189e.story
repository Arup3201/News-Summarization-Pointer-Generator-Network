Beating Arsenal to the signing of Alexis Sanchez last summer would have allowed Liverpool to battle for the Premier League title this season.

That's the view of former Reds striker Stan Collymore, who is convinced Brendan Rodgers' side would be near the top of the table with Chelsea and Manchester City had they signed the Chilean.

The Anfield club were keen on a move for the former Udinese star but he eventually joined the Gunners from Barcelona in a £30million deal.

Writing for his Bleacher Report column, Collymore said: 'I know for a fact Liverpool were interested in Alexis Sanchez this summer, but instead they decided to spread their money over a number of other deals.

'Alexis went to Arsenal, and the rest is history - he's scoring goals, playing at a high tempo and has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water.

'Liverpool missed out on the closest thing they could have got to Luis Suarez. I honestly believe had they signed Alexis, they'd be challenging for the title, and the good times would still be rolling at Anfield.'

Sanchez has proved an instant hit with the Emirates faithful having already scored nine Premier League goals, the most recent of which was the winner against top four rivals Southampton on Wednesday. 

Collymore added: 'Liverpool fans must be kicking themselves.'
