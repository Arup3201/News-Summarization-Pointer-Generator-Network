Her style has influenced the planet's most fashionable women and at 58 the editor, stylist and muse Carine Roitfeld shows no signs of slowing down.

The fashionista and grandmother is the latest star to front fashion website net-a-porter's weekly eZine following in the designer-clad footsteps of English roses Alexa Chung, Poppy Delevingne and Laura Bailey who posed for the site ahead  of London Fashion Week.

Editor of French Vogue for ten years Carine is one of the queens of the fashion world, but she admits she wasn’t always so confident about her style.

Carine shows off her slim figure (the result of daily ballet classes) in a jacket by Rick Owens and skirt by Bottega Veneta, both available at net-a-porter.com

In the interview and self-styled photoshoot for net-a-porter, the former model admits she only began to gain confidence about her style after Tom Ford gave her his ‘stamp of approval’.

Her advice now? ‘Use what’s underneath- put it outside.

‘Do what you are not supposed to do, like wear white shoes all year round.’

As well as turning to Tom Ford, who Carine worked with frequently during his 14 years at Gucci, and then at Yves Saint Laurent, for fashion advice, the beauty admits she also relies on the opinion of her long term partner.

Carine and Christian Restoin, founder of cult label Equipment, have been together for decades and Carine admits: ‘I always ask him what he thinks.’

It is hard to believe Carine Roitfeld is a grandmother as she smoulders in the shoot

Celebrated photographer Mario Testino also is a fount of fashion advice for Carine, and it was apparently he who was behind her evolution from ballet pumps and flat shoes to high heels.

She favours Gianvito Rossi’s footwear for seductive stilettos which are both ‘chic and comfortable.’

The renowned editor- who launched the
sell-out CR Fashion Book last year- also discloses her style and beauty
secrets including her ‘difficult’ daily hour-long ballet sessions, 
facial massage and long stints at Chiva-Som, the Thai spa recommended by
Kate Moss.

When it comes to fashion she confesses her signature black wardrobe is less of a style statement and more ‘because it’s easy.’
