Germany will wear black armbands and observe a minute's silence before their friendly clash with Australia on Wednesday night in memory of the victims of the plane crash in the French Alps.

Reports indicate there were no survivors from the 144 passengers - including 16 schoolchildren and two teachers - and six crew after a Germanwings plane travelling from Barcelona to Dusseldorf crashed near Digne on Tuesday.

Around half the victims are believed to be German and national Football Association president Wolfgang Niersbach confirmed the team would honour them against the Asian Cup champions at the Fritz-Walter-Stadion in Kaiserslautern.

Niersbach said in a short statement on the governing body's website: 'It is the one clear thought which overshadows everything else.

'We owe it to the victims and their families that the football family share in their grief.'

National team manager Oliver Bierhoff added: 'We are deeply saddened and stunned. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims.'

Real Madrid and Bayern Munich also observed a minute's silence at training on Wednesday.
