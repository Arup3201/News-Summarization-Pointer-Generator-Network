A £30,000-a-year vegetarian private school is being sued by parents who claim their son was subjected to 'racist bullying'.

St Christopher School, in Letchworth, Hertfordshire - known as 'St Chris' - differs from similarly-priced traditional boarding schools, such as Eton and Harrow.

Staff and pupils are required to eat no meat, there is no school uniform and pupils address teachers by their first names, rather than as 'Sir' or 'Miss.'

St Christopher School, in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, is being sued by parents who claim their son was subjected to 'racist bullying'

The school was founded in 1915 'to promote understanding amongst students of other cultures and religions' and create an environment 'where all children are celebrated as individuals, regardless of their particular abilities.'

Twenty-six per cent of its pupils are non-white.

However, the idiosyncratic school is now at the centre of a High Court row, after the parents of a pupil - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - refused to pay £25,000 in fees, claiming that 'members of staff at the school were racist.'

London¿s High Court heard allegations made by parents who claim their son was subjected to racist bullying

London’s High Court heard the school aims to promote the personal and creative growth of pupils as individuals through its libertarian approach to education and is the alma mater of film director Michael Winner, critic AA Gill and presenter George Lamb.

St Chris’s lawyers vehemently deny the parents’ accusations, but Mr Justice Holroyde must now decide whether the 'atypical independent school' has betrayed the principles laid down by its founding fathers.

The judge was told that controversy began brewing when the pupil’s parents stopped paying their fees and the company that runs the school, St Christopher School (Letchworth) Ltd, launched a claim against them, saying they were contractually obliged to pay up.

However, the parents countered with allegations that the school had failed their son and launched a High Court counter-claim alleging breach of duty against the school and seeking damages 'substantially in excess of the fees claimed.'

Anna Dilnot, for St Chris, told the judge today: 'The allegation is that a class teacher and a PE teacher discriminated against (the boy) on grounds of race...the allegation is that (he) was subjected to racial bullying which was not properly addressed by the school'.

The parents claim their son was given 'less favourable treatment on grounds of race', said the barrister, who added: 'The nub of the parent’s counter-claim is that the school was a harmful environment.'

'The allegations being made by the parents are serious: that members of staff at the school were racist...that certain members of staff encouraged an atmosphere where other students could bully...and that the school failed to investigate and then deliberately covered up the truth,' she added.

Among other things, the parents claim a PE teacher 'intimidated their son by shouting at him, causing him to wet himself' and 'called him an idiot in front of other pupils.'

The school was founded in 1915 'to promote understanding amongst students of other cultures and religions'

They allege that the atmosphere at the school 'caused a loss of confidence and self-esteem' in their son and left him 'anxious and fearful of bullying and sustaining injuries'.

The parents say their complaints should have been referred to Hertfordshire County Council as a child protection issue, rather than being dealt with internally by St Chris.

Flatly denying that the allegations, Miss Dilnot told the judge: 'The nature of the allegations is extraordinary. 

'The school strenuously denies all of them. Although it accepts that the parents genuinely believe that they are correct...there is no evidence to support their allegations.'

Sketching out the school’s founding principles, she added: 'St Chris is an atypical independent school. It is not like Eton or Harrow. 

'It is quite informal, there is no school uniform, pupils and staff have a vegetarian diet and the children call teachers by their first names. 

'It was founded to promote understanding between the different cultures and religions and on the principle that each child is different and should not be treated all the same.'

She said that the parents had signed a contract agreeing to pay the fees before their son enrolled and disputed their claim that the school’s alleged failings had absolved them of the debt.

She added: 'The issues for decision amount to whether the school acted in such a way as to breach its contractual duty, whether any breach was repudiatory and thus had the effect of discharging the (parents) from a future obligation to pay and whether any breach caused them any loss.'

The barrister also told the judge that the pupil at the centre of the row is now no longer at the school.Outside court, Miss Dilnot said: 'The counter-claim is for damages for alleged breach of duty and is substantially in excess of the fees being claimed. This is really all about the counter-claim.'

The boy’s mother is representing the family in person.

The hearing, set to last a week, continues.
