Reebok Australia has been fined $350,000 and ordered to issue refunds after the company was found to have misled customers about the benefits of their shoes.

Promotional material for Reebok's EasyTone shoes claimed that the runners would increase the strength of the wearer's various leg muscles through the footwear's unique design.

'EasyTone uses balance pods in the shoes to create natural instability, much like walking on a sandy beach, which encourages toning through increased muscle activation in three key areas of the leg,' the advertisements, which ran on shoe boxes, on Reebok's website and on information cards, read.

They were accompanied by images of women running and the claim that the runners could tone calves by 11 per cent, hamstrings by 11 per cent and buttocks by 28 per cent.

'The best part is that EasyTone works while you walk the dog, walk down the aisle, country line dance, chase after a bus, do the walk of shame… actually, when doesn't EasyTone work?'

Reebok continued to issue these promotions in Australia long after their international firm was fined $25 million by the US Federal Trade Commission in September of 2011 for making false claims about the shoe's benefits.

On Thursday, the Federal Court hit Reebok Australia with a $350,000 fine for 'for making false and misleading representations about the benefits of Reebok EasyTone shoes'.

The shoe company was also ordered to refund $35 to anyone who bought EasyTone shoes from September 2011 to February 2013.

'The Court found that Reebok's representations on the shoe boxes and swing tags on shoes, and information cards/booklets and in-store promotional material that if a person walked in a pair of EasyTone shoes, they would increase the strength and muscle tone of their calves, thighs and buttocks more than if they were wearing traditional walking shoes were false and misleading and consequently contravened the Australian Consumer Law (ACL),' the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement.

'Further, the Court held that Reebok had no reasonable grounds for making the representations.'

'Where businesses claim their products have certain performance characteristics and benefits, they have a responsibility to ensure that those claims are accurate and supported by credible evidence. This is particularly important in cases such as this where it is difficult for consumers to independently verify the claims,' ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said.

A spokesperson for Reebok Australia told Daily Mail Australia, 'We are happy to have resolved the ACCC's inquiry over our historical EasyTone advertising so that we can return our focus to inspiring people everywhere to be their absolute best - physically, mentally and socially.'
