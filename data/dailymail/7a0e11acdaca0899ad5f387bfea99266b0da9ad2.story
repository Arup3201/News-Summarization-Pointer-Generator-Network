One in five newlyweds are opting for a Kimye honeymoon – taking a short post-nuptial getaway while saving for a bigger trip later in the year.

As rumours swirl that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have started married life with a five-day trip to Ireland, new research reveals the trend for taking a mini-moon is on the rise.

Brits are shunning exotic honeymoons with nearly a third (31 per cent) preferring to stay in the UK to celebrate their newly-wedded bliss.

The UK was crowned romantic honeymoon destination of choice, with the nation picking cream teas, rolling hills and cooler climes as the place to celebrate their new life together, according to the vouchercodes.co.uk survey.  

America came in second with one in 12 Brits (eight per cent) planning their honeymoon adventure there, while the glorious beaches of the Caribbean take third place. 

European hotspots Greece and Italy complete the top five. 

Those living in the South West of England are most likely to enjoy an at-home honeymoon, with more than two-fifths of residents (43 per cent) claiming they'll stay at home. 

Brummies are the most likely to enjoy an adventure honeymoon, while one in five couples from Devon, Cornwall and Dorset are most likely to satisfy itchy feet by travelling to more than one destination on their romantic getaway.

The mini-moon trend is being led by the squeezed younger generation, with a quarter of those under 35 (24 per cent) choosing to save and take their dream trip at a later date. 

This is compared to their parents' generation; 85 per cent of whom chose the traditional route of taking a full honeymoon straight after the wedding.

Mini-moon: More newly-weds are opting for a staycation honeymoon, saving for a bigger trip later in the year

Anita Naik, lifestyle editor of vouchercodes.co.uk, comments: ‘Kim and Kanye's wedding has been one of the most talked-about events of the year and whilst the couple are rumoured to be enjoying a mini-moon in Ireland it seems savvy Brits will be taking advantage of the delights on their own doorsteps.

‘With so many beautiful locations and exciting activities to choose from on home turf - including culture-packed city breaks, secluded countryside jaunts or relaxing beach holidays – Brits can enjoy the honeymoon of their dreams without breaking the bank. 

‘Newly-weds should take the time to shop around before booking; travel companies do some fantastic offers and there are always vouchers to be found for hotels and activities.’
