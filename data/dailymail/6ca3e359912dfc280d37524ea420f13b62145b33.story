A man known as 'Fat Boy' and 'Biggie' has been arrested after police found 23 grams of marijuana hidden under his stomach fat.

The unusual hiding spot was discovered by police when they pulled over a vehicle after noticing 450 pound Florida man Christopher Mitchell, 42, was not wearing a seat belt.

The packet of marijuana was hidden on Mitchell, while traces of cocaine, a handgun and cash were found in the vehicle during the routine traffic stop.

Mitchell is known locally as 'Fat Boy' or 'Biggie', according to the New York Daily News.

According to police documents, when Mitchell and driver Keithian Roberts, 38 were pulled over, Mitchell told police he was too big to fit the seat belt.

Police reported they both appeared nervous and the car was covered in carpet freshener and scented dryer sheets - typically used to mask the smell of drugs while being transported.

A sniffer dog was then called in and police collected 1g of cocaine from the vehicle and a packet of marijuana concealed underneath his large belly.
