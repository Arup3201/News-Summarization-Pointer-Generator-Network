From a distance it could have been 007 himself, tearing along the River Thames on a speed boat.

But the scruffy bundle of blond hair, crumpled suit and confusion which clambered from the Royal Navy RIB could only have been London Mayor Boris Johnson.

The London Mayor made the dramatic entrance to launch the London Poppy Day Appeal, which organisers claim is the most ambitious ever.

After speeding along the river past some of the capital’s famous landmarks, Mr Johnson waved his helmet in the air as he pulled alongside HMS Severn at Canary Wharf.

In a spectacular scene, the RIB was then winched on board the warship, where Mr Johnson met the captain and crew.

It is just the latest unusual mode of transport chosen by the top Tory, who famously got trapped on a zipwire before the London Olympics, travelled in a cable car across the Thames with Arnold Schwarzenegger and launched the popular Boris Bikes cycle hire scheme.

The RIB was winched out of the water to allow the London Mayor to climb aboard HMS Severn with his usual style and grace

Mr Johnson said: ‘It’s been a real 
honour to fly down the Thames on a Royal Navy RIB to help raise 
awareness for London Poppy Day and I am humbled to be standing shoulder 
to shoulder with those who serve.

‘I know that Londoners will join me 
in showing their support for the Armed Forces and dig deep to help raise
£1 million in a day.’

Mr Johnson carried was seen boarding HMS Severn carrying huge poppy, before posing for photographs with crew members.

The spectacular stunt was part of the launch of London's Poppy Appeal for the Royal British Legion

In his usual chaotic style, Mr Johnson clambered aboard HMS Severn carrying a huge poppy to launch the London Appeal

He also made a donation to the Royal 
British Legion’s appeal using ‘contactless’ technology, helped by Lt 
Commander Marcus Hember of the Royal Navy.

For this year’s campaign, 
Barclacycard has donated 400 mobile card payment machines to help people
to make donations using their debit cards.

Mr Johnson later became the first person to make a 'contactless' donation to the appeal with Lt Commander Marcus Hember of the Royal Navy

From November 1 more than 2,000 2,000 
from the Army, Navy, RAF and companies will start collecting for the 
appeal at 70 Tube and mainline rail stations. They hope to raise 
£1million in just 12 hours.

Mr Johnson's arrival was reminiscent of David Beckham's dramatic entrance to the London Olympics opening ceremony., when he used a speed boat to carry the torch to light the iconic cauldron.

Mr Johnson bolstered his reputation as a Tory high flier after getting stuck on a zipwire in London's Victoria Park when a stunt promoting the Olympics went awry

Charles Byrne, fundraising director at The Royal British Legion, added: ‘At a time when pride in the capital has never been higher, London Poppy Day is a chance for Londoners to show their support and gratitude for those who serve.

‘Every year we have more than doubled the amount raised on the day. In 2011 we hit £450,000 - and this year we're aiming to hit £1 million.’
