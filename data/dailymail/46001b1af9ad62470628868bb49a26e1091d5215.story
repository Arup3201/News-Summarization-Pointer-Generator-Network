Natasha Hugh has been jailed after lavishing £40,000 of her boxer husband's ill-gotten gains on a luxury wedding and dream honeymoon

A 'gangster's moll' has been jailed after lavishing £40,000 of her boxer husband's ill-gotten gains on a luxury wedding and dream honeymoon. 

Natasha Hugh, 27, splashed out on an opulent wedding to  former heavyweight champion boxer turned international cocaine dealer Justyn Hugh, in Cardiff. 

A court heard beautician Hugh paid out for a luxury ceremony including chocolate fountains and casino tables and was seen paying a hairdresser from a 'blue gym bag' stuffed with bank notes.

The mother-of-two and her drug dealing husband then flew off on a dream honeymoon to Barbados.

Her extravagant lifestyle came to an end when 29-year-old former Welsh light-heavyweight champion boxer Justyn Hugh was jailed for running an international cocaine ring.

Hugh was found guilty of eight charges of laundering nearly £70,000 of her husband's £500,000 drug operation.

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'There was a lavish lifestyle which wasn't sustainable on the declared earnings of Mr and Mrs Hugh.

'The majority of transactions were dealt with in cash instalments.

'Mrs Hugh knew or should have known the money had come from crime.'

Hugh splashed thousands of pounds in her home town of Newport, South Wales, during a four year spending spree.

A court heard she had a £10,477 wedding at the Vale Resort - a luxury four star golf, spa and leisure hotel near Cardiff.

Hugh spent £2,260 on dental work and £2,435 on bridal wear and accessories ahead of her plush ceremony.

Hugh also paid for the £3,900 holiday to Barbados using cash, staying at the Almond Causarina hotel on the Caribbean island.

She bought a Mini Sytner with almost £5,000 paid in cash - she later exchanged the car for a £19,570 Mini Countryman.

She spent £4,000 on hairdressing equipment for a beauty salon she set up called Glamorous U.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how she also spent £13,000 putting her child in nursery.

Hugh claimed her husband had a 'controlling and violent nature'.

She wept in the dock as Judge Stephen Hopkins QC jailed her for 18 months and told her: 'To adopt the expression - you were willing to become a gangster's moll.

'I do not accept you were genuinely remorseful, just sorry you were caught.

'It was pure greed and you were willing to tolerate your husband's behaviour because of the financial benefits of his drug dealing activities.

'After a time you knew exactly what he was doing and exactly where his money was coming from.'

Welsh light-heavyweight champion Hugh was jailed for 11 years earlier this year after running a £500,000 drugs operation which had links to Albania and the Netherlands.
