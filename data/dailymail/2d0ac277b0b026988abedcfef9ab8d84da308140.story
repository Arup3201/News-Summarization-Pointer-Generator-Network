Prince Albert of Monaco’s new wife Charlene Wittstock has become ‘depressed’ at her failure to provide her husband with a legitimate heir, it was claimed today.

Princess Charlene is said to have struck a ‘deal’ with the principality’s playboy ruler to bear him a child after she tried to flee before their wedding last summer.

But the 33-year-old South African is now unable to get pregnant, France’s Voici magazine reported.

Albert already has already fathered two love-children, but neither can succeed him as they were both born out of wedlock.

Voici magazine said: 'Charlene has made the subject of pregnancy a taboo topic around the Royal palace.

'She might have a smile on her face at official functions, but inside she is stressed and frustrated.

'This subject is weighing more and more heavily on her shoulders.'

Rumours of a rift and a ‘pregnancy pact’ erupted even before the couple married in a lavish state wedding ten months ago.

Charlene was said to have bolted for Nice airport two days before they married after hearing Albert had had a third love-child during their relationship.

Monaco officials were said to have coaxed her back by brokering a deal between the Prince and his reluctant bride that she provide him with a legitimate heir.

After that she would be free to leave of her own free will, it was reported last July.

One source said at the time: 'Charlene will provide an heir, then if things don’t go well, she will receive a generous divorce settlement once she’s served a decent amount of time.'

Albert, 54, has one seven-year-old son Alexandre with Togolese air hostess Nicole Coste. He has another daughter Jazmin, 20, born after a brief affair with American estate agent Tamara Rotola.

Charlene last year called suggestions that she was reluctant to marry 'hilarious' on the Today show.

'Why would we go to all this effort, to have this fantastic couple of days, and have our most intimate and dearest friends come and join us, for us to be reluctant,' she said.

Her husband suggested the rumours might have been triggered by jealousy from people who 'did not like the fact that we were finally together and married.'

He was apparently told on the day of his 
wedding that he would have to take a paternity test to determine whether
 he was the father of the third illegitimate child.

Charlene, who was accused of trying 
to run away three times before she married, claimed the rumours were 
purely generated to sell magazines.

But she spoke earlier this year about her ‘loneliness’ in Monaco, and added: 'I only have two people I consider friends here.'

Before he met Charlene four years ago, Albert dated dozens of the world’s most famous and beautiful women, including Angie Everhart, Brooke Shields, and supermodel Claudia Schiffer. He also battled persistent rumours he was gay.

A Monaco government spokesman insisted that once he met Charlene, Albert knew he had finally found the woman he wanted to provide an heir.

The spokesman told France’s high society Point de Vue magazine last year: 'Charlene has beauty and style, and we are all praying that she will ensure the royal succession in our principality.

'Albert has never settled down in the past, but knows that the time is now right to produce the next ruler of Monaco.'
