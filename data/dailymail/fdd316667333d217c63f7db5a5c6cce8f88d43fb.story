Sex tapes have just been given a 21st century makeover thanks to the new Sex with Google Glass app.

Forget mirrors on the ceiling or handheld cameras, couples can now use the wearable technology to record their most intimate moments. 

The app also lets couples see sex through their partner’s eyes by streaming the view from their respective device.

The Sex with Google Glass app was created at the Wearable Tech Hackathon in London. During intercourse, each partner can stream what their other half is seeing while wearing the headset. A video is recorded throughout and can be replayed for up to five hours before being deleted automatically

Google has previously taken a firm 
stance on apps that feature explicit content, and most famously banned 
the pornographic app ‘T*** & Glass’ by developers MiKandi.

The
 app was downloaded from the developer's website by 17 Google Glass 
owners on its debut day, while the site was visited by some 10,000 
people before Google pulled the plug.

‘T***
 & Glass’ let viewers browse adult content and, with Glass’s 
capability of displaying and recording, the app also reportedly let 
users record and upload their own intimate content – similar to the Sex 
with Google Glass app.

Maktabi claims people at Google are aware of the project but he has not had an official word from the firm. 

Sex with Google Glass was developed by Lebanese product design student Sherif Maktabi during the Wearable Hackathon event in London in November. 

Explaining why he created the app, Maktabi said: ‘We want to change the way people experience things.

‘We love using design and strategy to disrupt at scale. So when we asked ourselves the question "How can we make sex more awesome with Google Glass?" We came up with Sex with Glass.'

The app is controlled via voice commands. For example, saying ‘Ok glass, it’s time’ begins the recording and streaming process.

Wearers can then either film their partner during sex, or swipe the side of the device to change the view and perspective.

This includes streaming the footage being recorded by the camera on their partner’s device.

Once intercourse is over, wearers say ‘Ok glass, pull out’ and Glass will create a video of the event. This video can be replayed for up to five hours before being automatically deleted from the app.

If the wearable tech is connected to smart lamps, or other household devices, for example, wearers can control music, lighting and even search the web for sexual positions and other inspiration.

Maktabi is studying at London's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design.

Google launched its Glass, pictured, device in 2012 and only select customers, known as Explorers, have been able to get their hands on the technology. Rumours suggest the glasses will go on general sale later this year
