An Australian traveller took to the streets of America to film foreigners having a crack at guessing the meaning behind a string of Aussie slang - and the results are hilarious.

From bloke and dunny to esky and bogan – it’s among some classic words that appear to be a mystery to our foreigner friends when Kieran Murray, from Brisbane in Queensland, put them to the test.

The footage, uploaded to his YouTube account, shows the filmmaker asking a number of people on the streets of Los Angeles in the United States what a ‘dunny’ means, with one man responding: ‘A dunny is a little boy’.

An Australian traveller took to the streets of America to film foreigners having a crack at Aussie slang

Looking puzzled and confused, the people are heard throwing out clueless guesses as they stare blankly into the camera or at Murray.

When Murray asked if they knew what esky meant - a portable insulated container for keeping food or drink cool – one man responded: ‘Definitely a fine Eskimo lady’.

‘Like a fat person,’ one girl suggested.

Another word Murray said was bogan - an uncouth or unsophisticated person, regarded as being of low social status – one man said: ‘Bogan is a cloth made from a fur of a badger.’

When asked what a 'dunny' is - one man suggested it was an expression on a person

This woman was asked what 'bloke' meant. When she found out it means 'man' - her response was hilarious

While one woman was heard wording ‘bogan’ over and over and then she pauses and looks blankly onto the ground.

‘It [bogan] sounds like awesome – like it’s bogan,’ one woman said.

Murray told one man to use ‘bogan’ in a sentence – so he says: ‘You know, this guy has been acting bogan to my daughter’.

It seems not everyone is on board with our Aussie McDonalds slang when asked what 'maccas' was

One man asked whether maccas was a fish?

While ‘maccas’ is a term used quite frequently in Australia, most people questioned had no idea it was another word for the popular fast food giant – McDonalds.

‘Is that a fish?’ one man said.

‘Oh I immediately thought breasts – I don’t know why,’ another woman guessed.

‘Damn that girl got some nice maccas,’ one woman said.

Other words that left foreigners muddled were full stop and fortnight.

Most suggested it was just a term used for stopping on the road.

This man was asked to give a meaning behind a 'full stop' - he suggested it meant to stop at a traffic

This woman guessed it meant woman's breasts

With hilarious results - one man thought 'fortnight' was another word for trees

When Murray said full stop was another term for ‘period’, one man said: ‘It’s a period? For like woman?’

The last word Murray dropped was ‘fortnight’ – a period of two weeks – but people were heard repeating the word, with some asking Murray to pronounce it again.

‘Kinda sounds like medieval,’ one young woman said.

Many said it’s ‘the night before’ while one man suggested ‘it’s trees - some trees'.
