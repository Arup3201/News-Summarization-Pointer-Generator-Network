A ten-year-old boy has died after a teacher 'told him' to jump from a building.

The Chinese youngster, named as Jun Jun, fell 30 floors to his death after failing to write a self-criticism letter demanded by his teacher.

The fifth-grade primary school student had been told to write a 1,000-character apology by his teacher, Miss Chen, for talking in class.

His devastated parents have now launched a campaign against the extreme pressure put on Chinese students.

Devastated: The parents of ten-year-old Jun Jun who jumped to his death from a 30-storey building in China. The parents left devastated by the loss of their son have now started a campaign against the pressure students are put under in Chinese schools and are demanding that the teacher be sacked

Tragic: Jun Jun jumped from the 30th floor of a building and landed on a parked car outside the family home at a residential building in Chengdu, Sichuan province, in southwest China

Jun Jun wrote 'teacher, I can't do it' in his textbook. He also wrote 'I flinched several time when I tried to jump from the building'

Neighbours say the 30-year-old teacher told him to jump out of a building after he didn't do the task.

'Teacher, I can't do it,' was found written in one of his textbooks, along with 'I flinched several times when I tried to jump from the building.'

The child smashed into a parked car beneath the flat where his family live in Jinjiang district.

Due to China's strict one-child policy, it is likely Jun Jun was the couple's only child.

His family have posted a banner outside the school in the southwestern city of Chengdu saying 'The teacher forced our kid to jump off the building'.

'The police investigation is still under way,' an official in Jinjiang district said, refusing to comment further, the Hindustan Times reported.

The
boy's school said today on its verified account on Sina Weibo, a 
Chinese equivalent of Twitter, that the child and some of his classmates
had been ordered to write reviews of their behaviour after they 
disturbed a speaking competition.

He died 'by accident', it said.

Strict
discipline is an essential part of China's education system and 
culture, and tradition demands deference to authority, putting children 
under pressure to obey instructions.

Campaign: A banner outside Jun Jun's school was put up by his heartbroken relatives. He was reportedly told to jump from a building by his teacher Miss Chen as punishment for not completing a task he was set

Fired: Jun Jun's parents are calling for the teacher that allegedly told him to jump from a building to be sacked

Messages: Photographs of the boy's study book pasted around the school by his parents showed that he had written several times that he had tried to jump from a building

School: The school is based in the southwestern city of Chengdu (pictured here)
