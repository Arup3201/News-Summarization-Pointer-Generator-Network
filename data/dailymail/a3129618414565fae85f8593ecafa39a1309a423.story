On Monday night, a witness says they saw a vehicle speeding out of the upscale Alabama neighborhood where NFL linebacker Rolando McClain lives.

The Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's department says that car could be connected to a fire that consumed McClain's six-bedroom brick home home, and deputies are now considering arson.

Lt Andy Norris said that investigators have yet to determine whether the fire was intentional, though detectives were on the scene searching for clues.

Suspicious: The Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's department says a car speeding out of the neighborhood could be connected to a fire that consumed Rolando McClain's home

A K9 unit will be brought in to determine any signs of accelerants  after the fire that could point to arson, Norris said.

'Anytime you have a vacant house go up, particularly one of that value, you have to consider it suspicious,' he said. 'Every house in that neighborhood is probably over $1 million.'

Located on four acres of land next to Lake Tuscaloosa, with a three-car garage and a boat house, the six-bedroom, five bathroom home was listed for sale in June for $1.5million with RE/MAX.

After news of the fire, the linebacker tweeted, 'It can't be real! To (sic) much of my "history" in that house for it to be gone...'

McClain grew up in Decatur and went on to play college football in Tuscaloosa at the University of Alabama.

The house was listed as the player's home address in a  document filed in court in September involving visitation rights for his and his ex-wife's 3½-year-old daughter.

Standout: After college, McClain was drafted eighth overall, eventually inking a deal with the Oakland Raiders for $40million in 2010, retired twice, and now at 25 is playing high-level football at Dallas

McClain has already seen his fair share of ups and downs in his life. After a standout college career, he was drafted eighth overall, eventually inking a deal with the Oakland Raiders for $40million in 2010.

He was released in 2013 by the team, picking up several arrest charges, one of which was dropped, along the way.

He was eventually signed by Baltimore, though he failed play a single game in a Ravens jersey, announcing he was retired a month later.

He was reactivated in 2014 then retired again, before being traded to the Dallas Cowboys, where he has shocked as a formidable linebacker, replacing Sean Lee who was lost to injury.
