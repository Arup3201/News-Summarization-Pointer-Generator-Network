A 'shambolic' overhaul of the Government's computer systems has left some departments in chaos and unable to work properly, it has emerged.

Lib Dem Cabinet ministers Vince Cable and Ed Davey held crisis talks with David Cameron last week after staff at their departments were left struggling to cope.

Mr Cable, the Business Secretary, is said to blame Tory ministers for forcing departments to slash costs and use small companies instead of tried-and-tested larger firms.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey - pictured on the top of his department in Whitehall, has been accused of overseeing a 'shambolic' IT upgrade leaving his staff unable to send emails and get on the internet. The Energy Department's rooftop - where Mr Davey is pictured above - was used

The Tories had demanded that smaller companies are given the chance to help bring Whitehall's creaking IT up to date.

But this has left staff at the Business and Climate Change departments struggling with email problems and a dodgy internet connection since the new system was introduced in early May.

Some have allegedly resorted to using their personal accounts, such as Hotmail or Gmail, to email messages and documents.  

Mr Cable is so concerned about the IT failures that he has urged other cabinet colleagues not to overhaul their IT systems until 'lessons could be learnt' from the fiasco.

One official who has been left struggling to cope the new system told the Financial Times: 'Getting more SMEs in was an idealistic Tory policy in 2011 to shake up Whitehall.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has told David Cameron about the problems his staff are facing after a botched IT upgrade. He is said to have warned other ministers not to touch their computer systems until 'lessons are learned' from the fiasco

'But in effect they are not necessarily the best fit for this sort of task.'

One source added that the IT overhaul had been 'shambolic'.

Officials have allegedly been left struggling to cope with lost work, painfully slow internet connections and screen freezes.

But one Whitehall official, who admitted the two departments had been suffering from 'transition issues', defended the upgrade.

The official said: 'This looks, quite unfairly, like an attempt by DECC and BIS to shift blame for their own mistakes. All departments remain responsible for their own technology and service procurement.'

The energy department said it had suffered some disruption from the new system but most people had been able to continue with their work.

'It’s a very bumpy ride for the last few weeks but everyone has worked through it and carried on delivering,' an official said.

The business department said: 'Much progress has now been made. BIS and DECC were the first government departments to implement the Cabinet Office’s new ICT strategy and lessons learned will help other departments when they renew their IT in the future.'

The Cabinet Office said: 'Civil servants need modern technology to do their jobs so we are replacing the expensive, inflexible and outdated contracts which we inherited in 2010. Our government IT reforms are saving taxpayers’ money and ensuring SMEs can compete alongside bigger providers.'
