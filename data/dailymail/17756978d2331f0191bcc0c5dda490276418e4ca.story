Brendan Rodgers has revealed Luis Suarez sent him a text wishing his former club the best for their clash with Southampton on Sunday.

The Reds started life post-Suarez with a 2-1 win after the Uruguayan left the club in the summer for £75million to move to Barcelona.

And Rodgers said the striker had sent him a 'lovely text', which he replied to.

Rodgers said: 'He [Suarez] sent me a lovely text this morning wishing us all the best and telling his old team-mates to start strongly. He’s a friend of Liverpool now,'

'I sent one back. He’s a good boy but he’s gone. His heart is with Liverpool. He’ll always be Liverpool and it was a lovely touch.'

Goals from Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge came either side of Nathaniel Clyne's equaliser as Liverpool stumbled to a victory at Anfield.

Suarez scored 31 goals for Liverpool in 33 Premier League appearances last season, and the club have recruited Rickie Lambert so far in the forward area to make up for his loss.

Suarez discovered earlier in the week he was able to return to training with Barcelona after appealing against his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini, but still won't be able to return to action until late October.
