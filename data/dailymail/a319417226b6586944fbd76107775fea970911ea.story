Melbourne will be the most popular family holiday destination for Australians over the next two years, a new report has revealed.

Travelling as a family can bring its own particular problems, but the survey by Roy Morgan Research shows that Melbourne has a little bit of everything to satisfy all needs.

Melbourne topped the poll with 25% of families surveyed plumping for it. Its main attractions being culture, museums, sport and shopping for all ages.

The Melbourne Cricket Ground has always been a great place for a family day out no matter what sport is played there

Surfer's Paradise comes in at second place as the most popular family place with its beaches being a real favourite 

 Theme parks, amusement arcades and endless sunshine also made Surfer's Paradise a good family destination

The Great Ocean Road area along with the likes of Torquay and Lorne came in fourth place in the survey

Surfers Paradise comes in second place. It has beaches, theme parks, amusement arcades and endless sunshine, and is another popular potential holiday destination among Australian families, 15% of whom say they’d like to visit.

It’s a close call between the state that Australian families would most like to visit. Queensland won out with 46% of families saying they’d like to holiday there in the next two years, closely followed by Victoria on 45% and New South Wales on 43%.

Thredbo/Perisher is the ski-spot with the most appeal for families as a potential holiday destination, with 54%.

‘Our latest findings reveal that the domestic destinations with particular appeal for families are those with plenty of scope for outdoor activity,' Angela Smith, Group Account Director, Roy Morgan Research, said. 

'Whether it’s on the beach or a coastal drive, in a big city or at the snow. 

“Knowing what Australian families look for in a holiday spot and how their needs and expectations differ from those of other travellers allows destination marketers, tourism operators and travel agents keen to reach this lucrative market.' 

Smith also said that among overseas destinations Australian families are more likely to name as potential holiday spots tropical paradises such as Fiji, Bali and Hawaii.

 

Sydney, and the likes of Circular Quay, put the city in third spot with holidaying families
