The final passenger plane has flown out of Blackpool airport, bringing to an end its illustrious 105-year history.

Staff wept as the last flight departed for the Isle of Man at 5pm, with the Lancashire airport preparing to officially shut its doors for the final time at 6pm, leaving 118 people out of work.

The airport, which was formerly known as Squires Gate Airfield, became one of the first UK aviation sites in the UK after opening in 1909, but has suffered from financial problems in recent years.

Check-in staff were in tears and were seen consoling one another as they waved the final few passengers through the departure gates this evening.

Balfour Beatty, who bought the site in 2008, put the airport in Lancashire up for sale in August following years of financial struggles, which saw them losing around £2m a year.

However, despite being one of the UK's smallest airports, Blackpool International airport  has a huge history.

The Lancashire airstrip has played host to a string of celebrity guests over the years.

It was 1909 that more than 200,000 spectators gathered to watch legendary airman Frenchman Henri Farman take to the air to perform in an air show on the site at Squires Gate on the Fylde coast.

Blackpool airport, which is being closed this afternoon at 6pm following years of financial struggles, dates back more than a century and has played host to a string of celebrity guests since it was first opened in 1909

In 1927 it was finally opened to the paying public, offering flights to and from the Isle of Man.

It later began short haul holiday flights to countries such as Spain and the former Yugoslavia and by 1950 had become a vital transport link, with 25,000 passengers passing through the airport to travel to Manchester, London, Leeds, Birmingham, Southport and Glasgow.

According to Stuart Menzies, who has worked at the airport for 28 years and who manages a fleet of aircraft from the site, the airport has been popular with royalty as well as VIPs.

He told ITV: ‘It is a small airport and they can arrive without encountering the paparazzi.

‘Very early on I remember the Sultan of Brunei came through on his way to the Lake District.

‘The Queen usually arrives once a year, very quietly, when she is travelling to see the Duke of Westminster.’

The most recent was pop legend Rod Stewart, who landed at the airport ahead of his summer gig at Blackpool FC.

In the 1983 General Election campaign, Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher used the airport to arrive in nearby Fleetwood for one of her final election rallies.

Pilot Brian Bateson, a flying instructor based at the airport, famously bought a Vulcan bomber in 1983 which he placed at the entrance to the airport. It was finally sold on eBay in 2004.

Former baggage handler Graham Spray, 72, remembers the airport's glory days when he watched stars such as Tommy Cooper pass through the airport on their way to their glitzy shows on the piers and in the Tower Ballroom.

In 1941, Britain's most famous female aviator Amy Johnson set off from Blackpool for RAF Kidlington in Oxfordshire on what proved to be her final flight.

The pilot, who found fame in 1930 as the first woman to fly solo to Australia, was a member of the Air Transport Auxiliary which flew aircraft from factories to RAF bases.

The airport is on a road named after the Hull-born pioneer, whose body was never recovered after her crashed plane was found in the Thames Estuary.

It was from Blackpool airport that the helicopter ferrying five Centrica workers to an offshore oil rig took off before tragically crashing in Morecambe Bay in 2006.

The final commercial flight will take off from Blackpool airport at 5pm today before travelling to the Isle of Man. The airport will close an hour later.

It will continue to operate flights to the Irish Sea gas rigs, but will no longer serve as a passenger airport.

Balfour Beatty, which bought the site in 2008, put it up for sale in August after several years of losses totalling around £2m per year, but no buyer has been found.

There are 118 staff members employed at the airport, which served 235,000 passengers last year - way down on the figure of two million per year that bosses had hoped for when they undertook a costly refurbishment of the airport in 2006.

Blackpool Council said the the airport's owners should have done more to save the airport from closure

Blackpool Council said the firm should have done more to save the airport from closure and find new businesses and airlines to operate out of the airport.

The Unite union was meeting management at the airport today as attempts continue to find a buyer, and a spokesman said the airport was working ‘with the independent aviation businesses and tenants to understand if their operations can continue in the future’.

‘Working in partnership with the local authorities, regeneration plans are also being developed which will be designed to create future employment and sustainable economic development opportunities,’ he said.
