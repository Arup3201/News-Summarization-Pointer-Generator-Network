It was Merseyside’s strongest league campaign in years, a season when Liverpool and Everton served notice that they are on the move again.

Though the Barclays Premier League trophy remained tantalisingly out of Liverpool’s reach and Everton faltered when Champions League football appeared in their grasp, the disappointments should not detract from the work the respective managers Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez have overseen.

So near: Brendan Rodgers came close to guiding Liverpool to the title but lost out to Manchester City

Leading the way: Everton manager Roberto Martinez has had a good first season at Goodison Park

There have been many outstanding performers in Red and Blue shirts but if you were to make up a combined starting XI, which players would make the cut – and, more significantly, who would be left on the sidelines?

See if you agree with Sportsmail’s selection; the formation would be a modern 4-2-3-1 and that has led to a few difficult decisions. But this team has pace, energy, balance and attacking flair and the players included have all had years to remember. 

GOALKEEPER: Tim Howard – Back to his best under Roberto Martinez and takes the place between the posts ahead of Simon Mignolet after keeping 16 Premier League clean sheets compared to the Liverpool man’s 10. Safe, reliable and vastly experienced and recently won a new contract.

Top stopper: Tim Howard helped Everton qualify for the Europa League next season

RIGHT-BACK: Seamus Coleman – Everton’s Player of the Season and a man whom Martinez dubbed the best in his position in the league; the fearless Republic of Ireland international has flourished under Martinez and scored seven goals in all competitions.

Coming of age: Seamus Coleman was Everton's player of the season this year

CENTRAL DEFENDER: Martin Skrtel – Defending was the reason Liverpool’s title charge fell down but Skrtel was the pick of Brendan Rodgers’ back four and made 36 Premier League appearances, scoring seven goals. He put through his net on four occasions but he was not a weak link by any means.  

Hard man: Martin Skrtel has been a rock at the heart of the Liverpool defence

CENTRAL DEFENDER: Sylvain Distin – It was significant that two of Everton’s poorest defensive displays, against Southampton and Manchester City, came when Distin was nursing a hamstring problem. A calming influence and model professional, his abilities often go under-rated.

Calming influence: Sylvain Distin was key at the back for Everton last season

LEFT-BACK: Leighton Baines – Nobody would describe this as being a vintage campaign from the England international but, equally, nobody would preclude him from a composite team. Always a threat at set-plays and his left-foot can be like a magic wand. A first class defender, too.

Always a threat: Leighton Baines and his dangerous left foot always gave Everton options

HOLDING MIDFIELD: Steven Gerrard – The abiding image of his season should not be his slip against Chelsea; it should be of him inspiring Liverpool, passing with elan and keeping cool under pressure to lead the title charge. 'Absolutely outstanding,' was Rodgers assessment. It is hard to disagree.

Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard helped keep Liverpool in the title race until the final day of the season

HOLDING MIDFIELD: James McCarthy – Many Evertonians wondered what they were getting for £13.75million when he was brought into replace Marouane Fellaini. What he soon showed was that Everton were significantly better with him in the engine room, a combination of class and graft. 

Star signing: James McCarthy has played a big part in Everton's sucess since signing from Wigan

RIGHT MIDFIELD: Jordan Henderson – Liverpool desperately missed his energy, work rate and technique during the three games he was suspended on the run-in. He said back in July that this season had to be 'my time' and his hard work has paid off with a trip to Brazil looming.

ATTACKING MIDFIELD: Ross Barkley – It must be pointed out that the 20-year-old hasn’t been consistently brilliant. But when he shines, when gets the bit between his teeth and torments opponents, he is a joy to watch and capable of moments that get you out of your seat. For that reason, he gets accommodated and Daniel Sturridge drops to the bench.

Boy for Brazil: Ross Barkley's performances this season have earned him a place in England's squad

LEFT MIDFIELD: Raheem Sterling – Started the season under a cloud, ended it in Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad. Quick, tough, skilful and blessed with a big game temperament, Sterling’s performances were special. We will hear more and more of him in the coming years, as he shows the hype that accompanied his reputation in Academy football was not without substance.

Proving his worth: Raheem Sterling is another young player who has earned his spot in England's squad

CENTRE FORWARD: Luis Suarez – The first name on the team sheet. For the goals and the individual awards, the man who had a nose for trouble has catapulted himself into the bracket of the modern greats. Scored every type of goal in every type of game and it was impossible to accurately assess just how many points extra he was worth to Liverpool. 

Player of the season: Luis Suarez scored 31 goals for Liverpool this term

SUBSTITUTESSimon Mignolet (GK), Glen Johnson, Romelu Lukaku, Daniel Sturridge, Gareth Barry, Philippe Coutinho, Kevin Mirallas

So there you have it. Six starters from Everton may come as a surprise, given the respective finishing positions of the two clubs, but the key choice boiled down to whether to stick with Daniel Sturridge or opt for Ross Barkley.

Missing out: Romelu Lukaku and Daniel Sturridge fail to make the starting XI of our team

The Liverpool striker broke through the 20-goal barrier – and equalled a club Premier League record of scoring in 19 games, like Robbie Fowler did in 1994/95 – Barkley’s ability to produce the unexpected demands his inclusion. That he is going to the World Cup merely strengthens his claims.
