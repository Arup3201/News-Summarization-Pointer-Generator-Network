Frank Lampard more than anyone else - more than John Terry even - symbolises everything that’s been positive about Chelsea in the Roman Abramovich era.

In fact, he’s the man who really should have been Chelsea captain through all their years of success since the Russian billions arrived.

Giving the armband to a professional like Lampard would have improved the club’s image and reputation dramatically.

Time to go: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has let Lampard hold talks with New York City FC in the MLS

He’s played his heart out on the pitch, and he’s been brilliant as a club ambassador off it. Anyone who has seen Lampard devote time to fans after games will know exactly what I’m talking about.

You might think it’s the least he should be doing given the amount he earns, but he does it, and he does it with a sincerity few others can match.

On the field he doesn’t seem to have given any manager a problem, even when Jose Mourinho wasn’t picking him last season, he was ready to give everything when called on.

On the training ground there is no better man to set the example than Lampard. He has enjoyed a very successful career thanks mainly to the hours and hours of work he has put in on the training ground.

His decision to go to the MLS in America is a huge loss for Chelsea. It’s widely believed what made Roy Hodgson’s mind up about taking Lampard to this World Cup is his positive influence in the dressing room.

They will miss that at Stamford Bridge. Sure, Terry is there, but he’s hardly unblemished off the pitch, and it remains to be seen if the captain can take the weight of responsibility solely on his shoulders without Lampard.

Positive influence: Roy Hodgson selected Lampard in his World Cup squad partly for his mentoring of the young players

At the height of the Wayne Bridge scandal, I strongly felt Lampard should have replaced Terry as captain. It would have won Chelsea a lot more friends, that’s for sure.

To lose Ashley Cole is one thing – that’s a true winner gone. David Luiz, a big positive in the dressing room has also gone – that will be hard to replace.

But to then lose Lampard – a great club man, a terrific player, and a hugely important leader in the squad - in the same summer, is just too careless from Mourinho.

If Lampard can exploit the connections his new club New York City has with Manchester City and returns to the Premier League on loan with the Champions next season, it could leave Mourinho looking very stupid.

Departing: David Luiz is also set to leave Chelsea and join Paris Saint Germain this summer

How dare Southampton hold Adam Lallana back?

This is a player who has given everything for the club: he was one of the best players in League One when they achieved promotion, likewise when they went up from the Championship, and he has improved again to be recognised as one of the elite footballers in the Barclays Premier League.

Could this player have done more for the club? No way, he’s given everything since Southampton took him from Bournemouth as a 12-year-old for an initial compensation fee of just £3,000.

Southampton will defend their right to ask for a bigger fee for Lallana, who could have joined Juande Ramos’ Spurs for £5m six years ago.

Disrespectful: Southampton should allow Adam Lallana to leave for Liverpool given his service to the club

Saints have been the club that turned him into a probable England World Cup player, and they will have to pay Bournemouth 25 per cent of any transfer fee they receive.

But if they have turned down a £25m offer from Liverpool, simply because they want to squeeze more money from the deal, then I find that disrespectful to the player.

He’s earned his move to a bigger club with bigger wages and Champions League football, after delivering on the field for Southampton. 

Saints should let the Liverpool deal happen before the World Cup so that the player can focus on Brazil.

Isn’t that what Lallana deserves after everything he’s given to Southampton Football Club?
