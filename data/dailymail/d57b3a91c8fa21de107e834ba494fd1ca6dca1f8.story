Celebrity chef Todd English's debauched partying has once again landed him in trouble with a former lover and back in the spotlight.

A photo emerged last month of the sweaty and bleary-eyed 53-year-old in a steaming hot tub with his arms draped over topless young women.

The picture, taken on a cellphone, was snapped during English's apparently wild night at the guest-list only club Provocateur in Manhattan's Meatpacking district.

Wenjie Song, who is close friends with Todd English (pictured), denied she was one of the topless women in the hot tub picture

One woman in the photograph resembles a friend of English, Wenjie Song, according to the New York Post.

Miss Song is a Chicago-based derivatives trader who shared a picture of herself 
hugging English on her Instagram account around Valentine's Day. She has
 denied that she is in the photograph, saying 'her breasts are bigger'.

English,
 who is worth an estimated $15million from his chain of restaurants 
including Olives, Figs and Ca Va, was reportedly 'annihilated' at the 
time, a source told the Post.

The seedy picture was not the only scandal English caused at the exclusive club last Saturday.

He
 was reportedly making out with two women at the same time in a booth 
when his ex-girlfriend, fashion designer Candice Sonneman, became upset 
and threw her drink in his face before fleeing the venue, the Post reported.

On March 1, Miss Sonneman tweeted:
 '@ChefToddEnglish I would greatly appreciate it if you'd please stop w/
 the unnecessarily nasty msgs & rubbing in the cheating.

'Living
 it & then having to read about it was more than enough. I am doing 
everything I can to have a peaceful conclusion. Work w/ me.'

English has become a well-known presence on the party circuit since jilting his fiancée Erica Wang weeks before their wedding in 2009. He had also been engaged twice before.

The chef allegedly fired a fake gun into the air at his lavish, private birthday party in 2012 at the W Hotel in lower Manhattan, according to the Boston Globe.

The terrifying moment was captured on camera for his E! chef reality series Playing With Fire.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from English's representative.

The
 chef divorced in 2002 from his ex-wife Olivia whom he met at culinary school.
 The couple have three grown-up children Isabelle, 20, Oliver and Simon.
