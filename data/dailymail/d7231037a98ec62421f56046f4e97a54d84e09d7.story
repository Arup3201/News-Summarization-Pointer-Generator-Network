A man was thrown into jail in Spain for nine months after leaving a sarcastic comment under his ex-girlfriend's Facebook profile picture.

In October 2012 the man, who has not been named, was banned from contacting his former partner by any means after a specialized Domestic Violence court in Palma, Majorca passed a protection order.

But just five days later the hopeless individual posted a mocking comment under her profile picture which read: 'Showing them what you've got I see, babe.'

After reading the comment, 'a la vete a enseñarlo guapa’ in Spanish, the woman alerted the authorities and the ex-boyfriend was once again brought before a court in Palma.

He was charged with breaching the restraining order and  sentenced to nine months behind bars.

He appealed his conviction, citing that the court could not prove who sent the Facebook message or that he had actually breached the order.

But the court in Palma said the man was 'completely conscious' of the fact his Facebook message 'was an infringement of the restraining order'.

Five days after being issued with a restraining order banning contact with his ex-partner the hopeless individual wrote a comment under her profile picture which read: 'Showing them what you've got I see, babe'

It is not the first time that Facebook comments have landed someone behind bars.

In 2013, a Texas teenager was jailed after making an offhand comment on Facebook about a video game he had been playing.

Justin Carter was 18 when he and a friend got into an argument with someone over a multiple player online video game, leading the teenager to post a comment he now regrets.

Rejected appeal: The unnamed individual lost his appeal against his nine-month jail term at a Domestic Violence court in Palma, Majorca (above)

He spent nearly six months in prison after saying: 'I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still beating hearts' only two months after the Sandy Hook school massacre. 

Although the teenager, who turned 19 while in prison, added 'lol' (laughing out loud) and 'jk' (just kidding) to his post, a woman from Canada who saw it reported Justin to police after finding out that he lived near an elementary school.
