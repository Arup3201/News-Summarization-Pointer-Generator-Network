This is the shoddy work of a cowboy builder caught in a TV sting after tricking homeowners into handing over 90 per cent of the payment upfront - and then leaving before the job is done.

John Guerin, 56, left dozens of homes across London in a 'state of ruin' and in need of emergency structural repairs over a five-year period in a £370,000 rip-off.

Many of the homes he targeted were left with gaping holes in walls or with full skips in the driveway which had not been paid for.

Others had to be re-wired or re-plumbed because they work was unsafe.

At one property Guerin had fled with the roof uncovered after the old one had been stropped away - but before a new one had been fitted.

In another instance, foundations were laid for an extension and the first few layers of bricks were laid before the conman fled.

Some were left in such a dangerous condition they were in peril of collapsing and homeowners had to stump up tens of thousands to get professional builders in to complete the job before they could move back in.

Many owners had to re-mortgage their homes in order to pay for builders to come in and fix Guerin's shoddy work.

John Guerin was jailed for five years at Croydon Crown Court earlier this month after being found guilty of 10 charges of fraud and one of obtaining money by deception.

The conman, from Biggin Hill, Kent, targeted vulnerable people and after starting work convinced customers to hand over as much cash as possible before he vanished.

The deception - which happened between 2006 and 2010 - was exposed on Channel Five's Cowboy Builders.

In total, cowboy builders rip off homeowners by a staggering £260m a year, a study has revealed.

According to research done by the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), people who pay builders in cash lose the equivalent of £712,000-a-day in shoddy work, which then has to be repaired.

A spokesman for the FMB, the largest trade association in the UK building industry with a membership of 12,000 building firms, said that paying for work in cash was ‘dangerous’.

The research by the FMB showed that of the 1,000 people quizzed in the poll, a total of 11 per cent said they had ended up with shoddy workmanship which they then needed to get redone.

Of that 11 per cent, 76 per cent had paid in cash - showing that using ready cash to pay builders was more likely to lead to poor quality work.

Brian Berry, spokesperson for the FMB, said today: 'Before employing a builder, it is vital to carry out checks to make sure you are using someone reputable, such as an FMB builder.

'Choosing your builder on price alone can be a false economy which may neither add value to your property nor make for a smooth building project.'

George Clarke, the presenter of Restoration Man on Channel Four, said: 'If you pay a builder large amounts of cash upfront then you leave yourself vulnerable to them increasing the price or walking off the job half-way through and you don't have any warranty if it all goes wrong.

'By using a reputable builder, signing a contract, and organising staged payments with receipts, you will have recourse if it all goes wrong.'

Many of Guerin's crimes took place in the London Borough of Bromley.

After he was jailed, Bromley Borough Council released photos of some of his shoddy building work.

The council said Guerin traded under a range of company names, including Bluewood Constructions Ltd, Greyfox Project Management and Merlyn Refurbishment Ltd, before he was snared.

In one case, Guerin was asked to build an extension for a man suffering from Parkinson's disease, but left with the project in a 'total mess' after getting more than £20,000.

Sentencing Guerin to five years in jail, Judge Heather Baucher said: 'It beggared belief that he would inflict such harm.

'Nothing will compensate the victims for the distress and misery caused.'

The court heard how the total amount paid by victims was £370,000 - but that with the increased costs of getting the job done properly meant victims would be 'left considerably out of pocket'.

Bromley Council added that it had made an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize Guerin's assets.

Councillor Tim Stevens said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case and the time is now conducting a financial investigation into any financial gains made so the council can seek to recover any sums that were overpaid.

'The outcome of this case sends out a very strong message that we will not tolerate criminals preying on Bromley residents and our trading standards team is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.'

During his appearance on Cowboy Builders, Guerin was challenged by Mr Littlewood about the quality of his workmanship.

The show is co-presented by former glamour model Melinda Messenger.
