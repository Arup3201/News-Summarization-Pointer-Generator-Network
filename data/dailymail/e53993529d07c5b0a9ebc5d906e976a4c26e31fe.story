Eating too much shark meat in fish and chips may be harmful to a person's health due to the high level of mercury in some species, a new study shows.

High levels of metals including mercury were found in the tissue of 30 dusky, sandbar and great white sharks that were caught in nets off the NSW coast, the Marine Pollution Bulletin found.

While fish is a good source of protein, Food Standards Australia New Zealand warns people should only consume some species like shark, marlin, broadbill and swordfish no more than once a week due to higher levels of mercury.

Pregnant women should limit consumption to once a fortnight, the website advises.

Analysis of shark tissue in the study found the two highest concentrations of mercury showed two 120g servings of dusky and sandbar shark would exceed the food standard's recommendations for weekly mercury level intake, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

The report revealed about 75 percent of samples from dusky sharks and 58 percent from the sandbar surpassed the food standard's mercury limit.

Shark fins were also found to have high levels of arsenic, which may cause health problems for people who regularly consume products like shark fin soup, the report stated.

'People can safely eat two to three serves a week of most types of fish. However, because of the presence of higher levels of mercury in some fish there are a few types you should limit in your diet, especially if you are pregnant,' Food Standards Australia New Zealand says.

'The named fish may contain more mercury than other species because they are long living fish and/or predators and can accumulate higher levels of mercury by eating other fish.' 

Sharks store mercury and  arsenic from species they hunt, according to Amanda Reichelt-Brushett, an associate professor at the Marine Ecology Research Centre of the Southern Cross University and co-author of the report.

She said while additional research was needed to reveal the toxicity of arsenic found in shark fins, food preparation was unlikely to reduce high concentrations. 

'The large males of the species are the ones to avoid in terms of accumulation,' Dr Reichelt-Brushett said.
