On the day Manchester United revealed they continue to explore ways of filling empty European dates with lucrative overseas friendlies, centre forward Robin van Persie claimed it won’t be long before the club are back in their favourite competition.

United’s commercial director Richard Arnold said on Monday that manager Louis van Gaal was happy for the club to look at ways of making up for lost Champions League revenue this winter by playing friendly exhibition games.

Van Persie said: ‘Our aim this year is to be in the top four. We have a great manager, great staff, great fans.

‘Everything is in place to be up there competing with the very best teams. I think we can do it and we will.’

After a battling 2-1 victory over West Ham on Saturday, Van Persie is convinced that Van Gaal’s theories are beginning to work.

‘Only me and Daley Blind knew how he works,’ said the Dutch striker. ‘He’s trying to get his philosophy into a lot of new players. It’s very demanding in a good way as you have to be focused every single day of the sessions or the meeting.

‘He wants players to get involved in the meetings too. That’s a bit of the Dutch thing, everybody gets involved in the project.

‘Some training sessions are incredible and we are showing that in games as well.

‘We had a setback against Leicester (they lost 5-3) but to win in circumstances like the weekend sends a message and shows that even in these difficult games we can win.

‘Now we have to extend that and make at least the top four.’

Van Persie was speaking at the launch of Abengoa, Manchester United’s first global sustainable technology partner.
