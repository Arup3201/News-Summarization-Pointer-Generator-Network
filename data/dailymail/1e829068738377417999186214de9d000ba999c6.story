Members of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy say they will have to be forcibly removed from the site of a multi-million dollar redevelopment after receiving an eviction notice on Friday.

The 'peaceful protest' was established in response to the commercial development of an area of land called 'The Block' in Redfern, Sydney, which protesters claim to be Indigenous land.

The eviction notice was issued by the Aboriginal Housing Corporation, accusing the protesters of trespassing on land pigeon-holed for a retail and commercial redevelopment since last year.

The Pemulwuy project has been approved for commercial and retail redevelopment of the site. It consists of student accommodation for 154 people, a childcare space for 60, a gymnasium, a gallery and affordable social housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families.

Many protesters, such as the embassy's founder Jenny Munro, say the land is being stripped from the indigenous community in an effort to push Aboriginal people out of Redfern. 

'The development of commercial and student housing does not assist the housing needs of our people in any way, shape or form,' Munro told Daily Mail Australia.

Not happy: Although the group has been promised affordable housing for aboriginal families, protesters believe the site won't benefit the wider indigenous community

Jenny says a scheduled meeting for Tuesday was cancelled by the Aboriginal Housing Corporation due to to heavy media presence. 

She welcomes the eviction challenge saying their 'peaceful protest' will not be going anywhere.

‘They will have to move us physically,’ she said in a statement. 

Mick Mundine, chief executive officer of the Aboriginal Housing Company, says the land is private and as long as they are occupying it, it’s simply trespassing.

Mr Mundine, who leads the push for the Embassy's removal, says the development will improve social conditions and ensure ‘Aboriginal people enjoy the same standard of living as all other Australians.’

Protesters are doubtful of their future inclusion as developers had previously advertised that Aborigines had moved out of the suburb as well as stipulations that housing will not to be offered to those with a criminal history. 

This means many socially disadvantaged members of the aboriginal community would be excluded from the redevelopment.
