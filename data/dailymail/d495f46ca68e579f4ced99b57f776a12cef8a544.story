Ever wondered how good you look in bed? Well now you can have the answer.

An app on Google Glass called Glance will soon allow users to see sex from your partner's point of view. 

With the addition of your phone, you can also see what sex looks like from another angle in the room. 

Glance app will stream the view from your partner's Google glasses to yours. Users can also record the view to watch back later on an iPhone. It claims to bring a completely new perspective on personal experiences 

To get started, a couple who are both wearing Google glasses will have to say 'Ok, glass, it's time.' 

The technology will then stream what they are seeing to each other. 

To end the session, the person wearing the glasses just needs to say, 'Ok Glass, pull out.'

The app was created by a team of three people, who came up with the idea during a hackathon in London at the end of last year.

Since Google Glasses were invented, a range of apps have been designed to enhance the product (picture posed by model)

They said of the invention: 'Glance let’s you see two different perspectives, seamlessly. It changes the way you experience something personal. Like sex.

'It’s an experiment. We are learning on the fly.

Having sex with Glance brings a completely new perspective.'

Anyone who wants to watch the footage back for a critique can also save the stream as a film. 

But the inventors are keen to point out that they have strict privacy guidelines and all footage is only available on individual phones, not on the app database. 

They said: 'Your videos belong to you. Not the Internet. 

Couples will be able to record the view from their glasses straight onto their phone to watch back later (picture posed by models)

'That’s why we’ve decided to upload anything to the cloud. And not host any videos. Not only that, but if you leave the app, everything disappears forever.

'Unless you deliberately save to your camera roll, everything is wiped.'

The Google Glass app hasn't launched yet, but it is now available as an app on the iPhone.
