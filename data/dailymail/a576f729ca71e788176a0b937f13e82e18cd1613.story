The mourning widow of Eric Garner spoke out Wednesday night following a grand jury's decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo for killing her husband with a chokehold and said she does not accept the officer's apology.

'Hell no,' Esaw Garner, 46, told a reporter who asked her if she accepted the 29-year-old cop's condolences. 'The time for remorse was when my husband was yelling to breathe…when he was screaming 11 times that he can’t breathe.'

The widow's angry reaction came out at the tail end of a press conference held for her and Garner's mother Gwen Carr alongside Reverend Al Sharpton.

'H*** no I don't accept his apologies': The mourning widow of Eric Garner spoke out Wednesday night following a grand jury's decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo for killing her husband with a chokehold and said she does not accept the officer's apology

Rev. Al Sharpton (left) President of the National Action Network, Gwen Carr (center), mother of Eric Garner, and Esaw Garner (right), his widow gave at times tearful, and at others angry, comments during a press conference held after a New York grand jury failed to indict the cop who killed Garner over the summer

'He’s still working, he’s still collecting a paycheck, feeding his kids,' Garner said of Pantaleo as Sharpton told reporters that would be the first and only question of the evening.

Pantaleo said in an earlier statement, 'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner...I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.'

Pantaleo had been stripped of his gun and badge and will remain on desk duty pending an internal police investigation that could result in administrative charges.

Garner continued:  

'My husband is now six feet under and I’m, looking for a way to feed my kids,' she said as she asked the question, who's gonna play Santa Claus for their kids this year?

It was an emotional punctuation to an otherwise straightforward press event.

Al Sharpton introduced Garner and her mother-in-law after calling for peaceful protests and condemning looters who've taken advantage of the situation in Ferguson.

Reverend Al Sharpton addresses reporters at the press event. The decision in Eric Garner's case has further fueled flames of unrest in communities who feel police racial bias is a rampant problem in America, where they say the legal system is tipped in police favor

Garner's mother Gwen Carr addresses reporters and expressed her shock over the decision. 'I don’t know what video they were looking at,' she said. 'It wasn’t the same one the rest of the world was looking at'

'There are some that take advantage of protests, they are not the protesters' he said, before clarifying his and his allies' stance on police. 'We are not against all police, but those who break the law should pay and be held accountable.'

Garner spoke after Sharpton and assured her supporters, many of them as furious as she over the grand jury's decision, that the fight would go on.

'This fight ain’t over, its just begun,' she said, before emotions took over. 'He should be here celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas with his children...He’s not here because a cop did wrong.

'As long as I have a breath in my body,' she said, 'I will fight.'

Garner's bereaved mother then addressed the reporters and expressed her extreme disappointment with the decision.

'I don’t know what video they were looking at,' she said. 'It wasn’t the same one the rest of the world was looking at.'

Like Sharpton, Carr ended her comments with a call for peace in all the protests nationwide.

'No Christmas': Garner, a father of six, won't be around to play Santa for them this year, a thought that had his wife in tears at Wednesday's press event
