After every England game at Wembley, when Roy Hodgson's post-match duties are almost done, a separate huddle forms around the country's head coach.

In these precious moments the soundbites that immediately follow a 5-0 victory over San Marino are designed to give way to some reasoned and considered thoughts in the wider context of the national team's development.

Hodgson speaks passionately about a group of players who are young, ambitious and upwardly mobile. Many of those travelling to Estonia for Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier in Tallinn have been sourced from The Arsenal, as Hodgson still respectfully refers to the north Londoners.

Roy Hodgson is pleased to see a group of Arsenal players forcing their way into his plans for Euro 2016

Five representatives — Calum Chambers, Kieran Gibbs, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain — were on the field at the start of the second half against San Marino. In a few weeks' time, when England prepare for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and a feisty friendly with Scotland, that figure could reach six if Theo Walcott is back from injury.

'It was not long ago that we had five Liverpool players, but it's nice to see people like Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere really starting to reach the potential that I know Arsene Wenger always believed they had,' revealed Hodgson.

Historically, the dressings room of international teams are packed with players from their country's top clubs.

Take Germany's success at the World Cup in Brazil last summer. Bayern Munich boasted six players —Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Jerome Boateng, Toni Kroos, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller — in the starting line-up against Argentina. Mario Gotze, another player from Bayern Munich, came off the substitutes' bench to score Germany's winner in extra-time.

Two years previously, when Spain won Euro 2012 with victory over Italy in the final, Vicente del Bosque started with five players from Barcelona and four from Real Madrid.

Oxlade-Chamberlain, who created two of England's second-half goals after coming on at the interval, believes the familiarity with his Arsenal team-mates benefits the national team.

He said: 'When you play week-in-week-out and then bring that to international football, it does really help in gelling the team together.

'The Germans and the Spanish have been able to do that. When you go and watch Spain play it's almost like watching Barcelona or Real Madrid play at the times, with the number of players on the pitch.

'It is a nice thing to have that with Arsenal at the moment. Liverpool have got a good number of players as well. It's not just those two clubs, everyone who comes away gels well — hopefully it will help us be successful. You know their characteristics and where they're going to pass and where they like the ball to be passed.

'When I got that ball down the line I knew Calum (Chambers) was going to be able to find me first and foremost and I knew that Danny likes to make that run to the front post.'

Estonia vs England probable teams

Of course, let's remember that the opposition so far this season have comprised Switzerland (beaten by Slovenia on Thursday) and San Marino (beaten by everybody).

Hodgson has focused on youth for this campaign, turning to the emerging talent in the country as England head towards the finals in France in June 2016.

At St George's Park on Tuesday, when Hodgson was a man short for the session he wanted to put on, he sent for Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker from Gareth Southgate's Under 21s.

It gave Baker a glimpse of the future, showing the youngster what is in front of him if he continues to develop as a player with England's junior teams. Blooding these players could yet be Hodgson's legacy.

'Realistically this team is mostly 21 or 22. People will tell me they don't reach their best until they are 27 or 28 so perhaps not.

'A, I want to win matches and B, plan for the future. I am picking people I think can do the job. A good example of that is Chambers. Here is a guy who played a few times for the Under 20s, jumped straight over the Under 21s and went into the first team. 

'That is a great pat on the back for our development system. I know not everyone agrees with this, but the pragmatic reason you have development teams is to get into the first team. You are an Under 21 player because you want to be a senior player. We didn't know how Sterling would turn out a year ago to the player he is today.

'We did not know the early days of Jordan Henderson at Liverpool that he would become the player he is. We didn't know Ross Barkley would kick on.

'I have been lucky enough to be there when it happened and I suppose, bright enough to realise that I don't have to hang my hat on 30-year-olds. If these guys are that good, I can put them in the team.'

As ever, the acid test for this team will be tournament football.
