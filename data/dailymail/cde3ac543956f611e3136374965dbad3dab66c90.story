Diabetes could become a global epidemic affecting one in 12 adults around the world (file picture) 

Diabetes has become a global epidemic, affecting one in 12 adults, scientists say.

And the number of sufferers is set to soar by 55 per cent in the next two decades unless the human population drastically changes the way it eats and exercises.

The study by researchers at the University of East Anglia estimates that 382million people had diabetes in 2013. At current rates, that figure is expected to reach 592million by 2035.

Around 10 per cent of sufferers have type 1 diabetes – an auto-immune disorder that is usually present from childhood. But the other 90 per cent have type 2 diabetes – an illness driven by a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet.

The chronic illness is a particular problem in fast-developing countries. In China and India, almost 10 per cent of adults have diabetes, compared with the global average of 8.3 per cent, reveals the study published in the journal Pharmaco Economics.

In Britain, around 3.2million people have diabetes. Lead researcher Till Seuring said: ‘Diabetes has become an epidemic.

‘The rising prevalence of diabetes in these countries has been fuelled by rapid urbanization, changing eating habits, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles.

‘Diabetes affects 382 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to grow to 592 million by 2035.

‘It is a chronic disease that has spread widely in recent decades - not only in high-income countries, but also in many populous low and middle-income countries such as India and China.’

He added: ‘We would hope that the findings further increase the policy attention being paid to diabetes prevention and management in rich countries and it should in particular make health and economic policymakers in developing countries aware of the economic damage that diabetes can do.’

The study, published in the journal Pharmaco Economics, cited data from the International Diabetes Federation estimating that 8.3 per cent of adults aged 20 to 79 now suffer from diabetes.

In China and India the number is closer to 10 per cent, with 165million diabetics living in those two nations alone.

Mr Seuring and his colleagues analysed the impact on increasing number of diabetics on the economies of 20 countries.

They found that increased healthcare costs and reduced workforce productivity could severely dent economic growth.

And Mr Seuring warned of a hidden cost of carers, many of whom leave their jobs to care for loved ones.

In Britain, where 3.2million people suffer with diabetes, Mr Seuring estimated the cost to be significant.

He said: ‘People in the UK with diabetes experience an income loss of £887 per year. But it is carers in the UK who are the worst hit financially, with a reduction in income of £1327 annually.’

That pales in comparison, however, with the US where the annual diabetes healthcare cost is $6,800 (£4,600) – and the total economic burden per person reaches $283,000 (£191,200) over a lifetime.
