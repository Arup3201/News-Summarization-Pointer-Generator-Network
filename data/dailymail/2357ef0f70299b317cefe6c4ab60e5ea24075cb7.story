The girlfriend of Manchester City’s Samir Nasri launched an extraordinary Twitter rant after learning her boyfriend was being left out of France’s World Cup squad.

Nasri, who won the Premier League title with City on Sunday, was omitted by the French manager Didier Deschamps when he announced the 23-man squad yesterday.

And after finding out he wouldn’t be on the plane to Brazil for this summer’s tournament Anara Atanes, who has been dating Nasri since last year, tweeted: ‘F*** France and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager.’

The model, who has also been linked to fellow footballers Freddie Ljungberg, Darren Bent, Kieran Richardson and Jermaine Pennant in the past, also posted: ‘Lets just get this straight! Im not mad i get my bf for 2 months.... I just think theres a level of respect to be had!’

Nasri then replied to his girlfriend on the social network posting: ‘Love you don't get upset life sometimes is unfair but you have to accept it and deal with it.’

The Frenchman is thought to have fallen out of favour with the French national side manager Deschamps due to disciplinary reasons, despite his impressive performances for City.

Unveiling his squad Mr Deschamps said: ‘He has important status with Manchester City because he starts, which is not the case today in the France team.’

‘But speaking before the squad announcement, Nasri told Canal+: 'I think the dye is cast. I respect [Didier Deschamps'] choice. I'll watch the World Cup on TV.

'If starting games in a club like Manchester City and winning two titles isn't enough, too bad, I won't regret anything.'

France are in Group E at the World Cup this summer, and kick off their tournament against Honduras on June 15.
