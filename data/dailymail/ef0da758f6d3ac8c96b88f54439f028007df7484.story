A 36-year-old man has been arrested over the murder of a wealthy socialite who was found collapsed with head injuries at his £2million home.

Roberto Charles Troyan, 63, who was known as Robert, died on March 8 at his flat in Mount Street, Mayfair, central London.

Police believe that he was attacked at some point before 4pm that day, and are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward.

Trusting: Friends of Mr Troyan described him as a 'larger than life' character, who 'trusted strangers too much'

Murder probe launched: The body of Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered at his luxury flat in this apartment block in Mount Street, Mayfair

Last night they arrested the 
36-year-old on suspicion of Mr Troyan's murder and he is being 
questioned at a police station in south London.

Mr Troyan's friend Sean McGuigan told the Evening Standard last week that he believed the 63-year-old was 'too trusting'.

Mr Troyan was discovered with a gash to his head in a pool of blood in the kitchen of his luxury rented Mayfair flat

He said: 'A lot of people around him 
were after his money. He had some incredibly expensive antiques in his 
flat including a vase worth £100,000.

'He was incredibly trusting, too trusting. He would lavish gifts on people and was quite carefree with his money.'

Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered 
with a gash to his head in a pool of blood by his maid in the kitchen of
his luxury rented Mayfair flat.

A post-mortem examination confirmed he died of head injuries.

His
mother, Marie, 83, described her son as 'one in a million' but said
there had been a 'terrible change in circumstances' after the death of 
his late partner, architect and interior designer Anthony Feldman - 
whose clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Tory Cabinet 
minister Jonathan Aitken.

The couple were the first to become civil partners, and the ceremony was held just a month before Mr Feldman’s death at 52.

Friends of Mr Troyan described him as a 'larger than life' character, who 'trusted strangers too much'.

Mr Troyan was born in Italy to a wealthy 
family but lived in the US for most of his youth. Mr Troyan studied art 
at college in Boston before moving to Britain, where he met Mr Feldman 
in 1983.

An obituary in the Times after Mr 
Feldman’s death said: ‘They were both immensely kind and generous to 
people in need and to charities for the homeless. Trudie Styler enlisted
them for her and Sting’s campaign for Tibet.’

Mr Feldman came to London from 
Johannesburg as an 18-year-old to study and went on to become an 
internationally successful interior designer and architect who took on 
commissions in London, Paris, New York, Hungary and Turkey.

Affluent: Flats on the street sell for £2-3million, while a nine-bedroom property on Mount Street is currently on the market for £32million

Mr Troyan and Mr Feldman worked on 
many design projects together, but their most cherished one was the top 
two storeys of the 1782 Henry Holland house in Mayfair they shared, 
where they painted the floors and fireplace in eight shades of pale grey
and several shades of white.

Their large drawing-room was adorned 
with a Bechstein grand piano and a dining table laid with mixed old 
china, napkins specially sewn in Turkey and Bohemian glasses for their 
extravagant dinners.

They became the first to take part in a
civil partnership in Westminster in 2005 after being given dispensation
to pre-empt the official start date because Mr Feldman had terminal 
cancer. He died aged 52 eight days after the ceremony.

About six years after Mr Feldman’s 
death, Mr Troyan moved out of that flat and into the flat, also in 
Mayfair, where he was found murdered.

A neighbour in his former flat said: 
‘He [Mr Troyan] came from a very moneyed background in America.

'He was 
totally devastated by Anthony’s death. It was Anthony that really kept 
everything running smoothly in both their lives.

‘After Anthony died, there was quite a
lot of coming and going of various characters, and it caused some 
problems. Nothing would surprise me.’
