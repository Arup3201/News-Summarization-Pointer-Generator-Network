Sajid Javid owed to change counter-terror laws used for official snooping on reporters

The Culture Secretary declared ‘journalism is not terrorism’ yesterday as he vowed to change counter-terror laws used for official snooping on reporters.

Sajid Javid said he was ‘shocked’ by the extent of police accessing journalists’ phone records revealed in a report this week.

He said new safeguards requiring the authorisation of a judge before such evidence is released would be rushed through before May’s general election.

Mr Javid said journalists were ‘just as much part of our democracy as the MPs that sit in the chamber’ and told an audience of political journalists: ‘If you are not free to go about your legitimate business, it is our democracy that suffers. Democracy needs journalists to function.’

A report by the Interception of Communications Commissioner Sir Anthony May this week revealed the extent of the use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to monitor journalists.

It was prompted after it emerged Scotland Yard had accessed the phone records of reporters to try to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row.

The report found that Ripa did not ‘provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources’ – and found that over a three-year period, 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into contacts between public officials and journalists.

Mr Javid said there was ‘no excuse’ for the authorities to use powers created to tackle terrorism as a tool to investigate reporters. He added: ‘Democracy needs journalists to function. That is why last month’s attacks in Paris struck a chord around the world. They weren’t just an attack on a magazine, they were an attack on the ideals that underpin our way of life.

‘Our journalists also face insidious threats from other quarters, be they commercial, judicial or political. Yesterday, we learnt the full extent to which Ripa was used to monitor journalists and their contacts.

Mr Javid said he was 'appalled' to learn legislation used to catch terrorists such as the Charlie Hebdo attackers was being used on journalists

‘Like many of you, I was shocked. In Paris we saw terrorists attacking the fundamental freedoms of the media, so I was appalled to discover that legislation created to hamper terrorists was now being used to undermine those very same freedoms.

‘Judicial approval will now be required before Ripa is used to access journalists’ data. It is a great victory for everyone who believes in press freedom.’

Mr Javid also referred to speculation that he plans to bid for the Conservative leadership when David Cameron stands down. He joked as he opened his address: ‘I have today agreed to let my name go forward for the leadership of... Oops, wrong speech.’
