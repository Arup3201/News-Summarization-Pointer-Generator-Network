It has been revealed that the Census Department may have faked the jobs report in the final month of the 2012 presidential campaign.

Unnamed Census employees are said to have inflated their reports for the national employment figures for last September, which would have attributed to why the unemployment rate dropped from 8.1 per cent in August to 7.8 per cent in September.

A columnist for The New York Post claims that he spoke with an unidentified source who says that there are a number of Census employee who falsifying the monthly numbers.

Working for him: There are new reports that Census Bureau employees may have inflated their findings in surveys about the national unemployment rates, which could have helped President Obama in 2012

The way that the closely-watched unemployment rate is determined is by having members of the Census Bureau interview 60,000 households from across the country about their job status.

The Labor Department requires that in order to submit a set of results for one of the six regions of the country that are surveyed, they have to have a 90 per cent success rate, meaning that for every 10 numbers dialed, they need to speak to someone about their job status on nine of those calls.

Julius Buckmon was named as a Census Department employee who was fired in 2010 for bolstering the numbers by saying that he spoke to more people than he actually did.

Mr Buckmon, who was working specifically in the New York and Philadelphia region, had not been hitting the 90 per cent mark but he reportedly had a conversation with a superior who said it was not a problem.

Final days: The most dramatic instance is said to be in September 2012 which came at a critical point in Mitt Romney's presidential campaign (seen here with his wife Ann before giving his concession speech)

'It was a phone conversation — I forget the exact words — but it was, "Go ahead and fabricate it" to make it what it was,' Mr Buckmon told The Post's John Crudele.

Mr Buckmon had been fired by the time President Obama was facing re-election, but The Post columnist says that he spoke to a source who told him the inflation of reports remained a problem long after he left.

'He's not the only one,' the source told Mr Crudele.

He goes on to claim that the problem 'escalated' towards the end of the campaign, but gives not specific reasons why the September 2012 figures have been singled out.

That shift- from 8.1 per cent to 7.8 per cent- was the most dramatic drop through all of 2012.

It undoubtedly helped President Obama during the final weeks of the campaign against former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.
