Australian troops will hand-deliver weapons to Kurdish fighters as part of the United States' request to supply vital military equipment to parts of the war-torn middle east in the fight again the Islamic State.

RAAF transport planes with elite special forces soldiers will deliver arms and munitions to Kurdish fighters battling militants in Iraq instead of air-dropping weapons, Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said.

It comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott talked down involvement saying there was no 'boots on the ground' role planned for Australian forces in the multinational effort.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed to reporters in Canberra on Sunday Australian planes would deliver military equipment to Iraq

'We want to make sure that we know where the arms and munitions go when we deliver,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said on Sunday at a joint press conference with the Prime Minister.

'They will be landing and handing them over to officials from the Peshmerga.'

The SAS soldiers are believed to be at Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and will accompany the RAAF C-130J Hercules and C-17A Globemaster aircraft when the equipment is transported, Fairfax Media reports.

'This is about what is right for our country and what is best for our world,' Mr Abbott said on Sunday.

He described the situation overseas as 'severe' and spoke of a specific type of terrorist 'who hate us not because of what we do, but because of what we are'.

Mr Abbott said he agreed to join the US-led effort and Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop to northern Iraq.

The Prime Minister also assured that no specific request to step up Australian military involvement in the area had been made and if we were asked the decision would be made under very specific criteria.

'Australia will join international partners to help the anti-ISIL forces in Iraq,' Mr Abbott said.

'The situation in Iraq represents a humanitarian catastrophe.'

He remains in close contact with the US and other allies.

Meanwhile, Greens senators are out outraged by the decision the Abbott government made without the consultation of parliament, The Age reports.

Independent Andrew Wilkie is said to have told reporters in Hobart that cabinet should have had an input on the matter.

'If Tony Abbott wants us to be gun runners for the Kurds at the behest of the United States then we are part of the war,' he said, according to the website.

Greens leader Christine Milne sided with Mr Wilkie, urging Mr Abbott to put Australia's involvement in Iraq at the top of the list for discussion in parliament on Monday.

Australian planes will fly alongside aircraft from Canada, Italy, France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison declined to comment on reports Australia could also be asked to consider deploying
Super Hornets for air strikes. The US had not made that request.

'We're not going to get ahead of ourselves,' he told Sky News. 

However, the government was looking at Australia's military capability across a range of areas and would consider other
requests. 

'Defining the mission and the objective was critical,' Mr Morrison said. 

'Let's not kid ourselves either, (IS) does present a threat. What we're seeing there is evil incarnate,' he said. 

Labor's foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek gave bipartisan support for the weapons drop, saying international
backing for anti-ISIL forces was the 'logical next step'. 

'Where you have reasonably effective fighting force ... being the only thing standing between IS and civilian
populations ... at risk of genocide or ethic cleansing, then there is an international

The US has stepped up its strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq this month, and is considering extending air strikes to Syria.

Since August 8 the US has conducted more than 80 air strikes, according to Central Command.

US warplanes have hit a wide range of Islamic State militant targets, including artillery, armoured personnel carriers, armoured Humvees, light trucks, mortar positions, checkpoints and roadside bomb emplacements.

There's potential for the air campaign to expand into Syria, in which case the US would have to call on aircraft and other elements of its military based in the Middle East and possibly Europe.

Australia could also join the US's air campaign, as well as extend its military role in Iraq more generally, as was laid out in Mr Abbott's foreign policy speech at Adelaide University last week, The Australian reported.

'We will do what we reasonably and prudently can to encourage American leadership because that leadership provided global security and stability,' the Prime Minister said.

'We are talking to our partners about how we might contribute to international efforts to protect people against the advances of the ISIS terrorists.

'This is a potential humanitarian disaster,' Mr Abbott said, in reference to the tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - surrounded by Islamic State fighters threatening to kill them.

Previously, Australia has been unable to answer US calls for air strike assistance due to concerns about the self-defence capabilities of RAAF aircraft. But The Australian reports that the RAAF now have aircraft suitable for Iraq.
