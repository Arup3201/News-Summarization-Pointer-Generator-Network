Seven years ago Steve Way had high blood pressure, smoked 20 cigarettes a day and weighed 16-and-a-half-stone after gorging on takeaway curries and chocolate.

On Saturday morning he will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games.

Way, who now weighs just 10st 8lbs, will not just be running to make up the numbers, either.

Going the distance: Steve Way will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

The 40-year-old was the third British man home in this year’s London Marathon, crossing the line in 15th place, just eight minutes behind Mo Farah, to earn his place at these Games.

Not bad considering he had slept in a camper van on his cousin’s drive the night before to save money.

Way, who works full-time in a bank in Bournemouth, found himself shepherded towards the recovery area in London with the elite athletes after earning his largest cash prize to date, £896.

He had to politely explain to stewards that his kit was with the mass participants.

Turnaround: Steve Way was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running

His next target is to shave another 45 seconds off his personal best and break Ron Hill’s 1979 British record of 2hours 15.46secs, for runners aged 40 or over. It has been a quite extraordinary turnaround for a ‘fat bloke’ who decided to run the 2006 London Marathon ‘on a whim’ and ended up beating many younger, thinner, fitter club runners by clocking 3hrs 7mins 8secs.

Fighting fit: Steve Way now runs 130 miles per week

Such an impressive time did not prompt Way to take up running properly. It was only 18 months later that he realised he needed to: not with any ambitions of joining the elite but for the good of his health.

‘Towards the end of 2007 I could hardly sleep,’ he told The Guardian. ‘I was coughing and waking up because of the smoking and it was impacting on my wife Sarah, too.

‘At that point half our meals were takeaways and I would eat chocolate and sweets all the time. I realised I had to do something radically different to break the cycle.’

Way trained for the 2008 London Marathon for 24 weeks, finished in 2hrs 35mins and changed his lifestyle completely.

He now runs around 130 miles a week — averaging 11 miles a day for the past seven years — and believes he could win gold in the 100km (62-mile) World Championships in Doha in November if he can clock under 6hrs 20mins.

He is a self-confessed ‘running nerd’ but still struggles to define himself as an elite athlete. There is clearly still disbelief that he found himself posing for pictures with Sir Bradley Wiggins in the athletes’ village in Glasgow and ‘casually ‘‘hanging out’’ with the guys I’m normally watching on the Diamond League circuit — even though I’m old enough to be most of their dads!’.

Whatever happens during those 26.2miles around Glasgow tomorrow, Way has certainly earned a celebratory takeaway, that’s for sure.
