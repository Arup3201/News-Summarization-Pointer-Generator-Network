A furious NHS matron has accused midwives of being 'rude' to women in labour and providing such a poor service that it could close the maternity ward, a leaked letter reveals.

In a damning indictment of midwives, medical and nursing staff, the Lead Nurse raises concerns about a 'worrying trend' in the lack of professionalism.

The four-page letter was written by Linda Birch, who runs the women and children's division of the Wirral University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, after a series of spot-checks.

Unhappy: Bookings from expectant mothers are down at Arrowe Park Hospital because staff are considered to abrupt and rude, says Lead Nurse Linda Birch, who fears the unit could close as a result (File picture of midwives not connected to the hospital)

In the letter Ms Birch states: 'The standard of care we are giving to our patients is not good enough and is deteriorating.

'Patients describe scenarios where they believe staff have been rude to them, abrupt with them and have been very unhelpful.'

Among issues raised are concerns over record-keeping, lack of privacy and dignity for patients who are not given 'what they need'.

Storage of medication and poor communication between patients and midwives is among the major issues forming another blow to the capability of the NHS.

Critically the number of bookings made by expectant mothers has fallen from 300 bookings per month in January 2011 to just 245 a month.

That means fewer than 3,000 births per year happen at Arrowe Park prompting concern that the maternity ward is not 'financially viable' and could face closure.

Lead Nurse Birch writes: 'At less than 3,000 births, our unit is not financially viable.

'We know that the overall birth rate is up locally, regionally and nationally.

'However, we are losing patients to other providers because we are rude to them, we are not giving them what they need, we are not providing good care for them.

'They are going away from us unhappy.'

The hospital serves an estimated 308,800 residents on the peninsula which lies between Liverpool and North Wales and 29 per cent of the population is below 30 years-old.

A spokeswoman for the Trust said: 'Our Wirral Women and Children's Hospital is absolutely committed to providing the highest possible standard of care.

'We recognise there are always areas for improvement and we take comments, concerns or feedback very seriously.

Rude: Midwives are accused of being 'rude' to women in labour, Lead Nurse Linda Birch said after spot checks at the Wirral Women and Children's Hospital within Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, Merseyside

'This letter reflects the passion within our Trust to address any deviation from the very high standards we set.

'The aim of sharing information is to engage every single member of staff in the part they have to play in keeping our patients at the centre of everything we do."

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) perform random checks at hospitals to ensure that standards of care are being maintained at a high level.

A spokesperson for the CQC said: 'We are aware of the concerns raised in the leaked letter and the information will form part of our intelligence gathering.

'The Trust will be expected to answer questions based on what we have collated when we pay a visit to carry out a full inspection of the premises and procedures.'
