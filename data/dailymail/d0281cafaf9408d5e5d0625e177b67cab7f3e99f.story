The number of U.S. sailors who claim to have been poisoned by radiation while serving during the 2011 tsunami in Japan - resulting in cases of leukemia, thyroid and testicular cancers, chronic bronchitis and brain tumors - has jumped to 51, as the group continue to fight the company they say didn't report the contamination when it happened.

The U.S. Navy members who were allegedly infected - who served aboard the USS Ronald Reagan and its sister ship the USS Essex - started to develop strange symptoms and sicknesses in the months following their mission near the Fukushima nuclear power plant, such as lumps, night sweats and dramatic weight-loss.

Now the majority of the group who worked in the rescue effort have been diagnosed with an assortment of diseases, after their ships' desalination systems pulled in contaminated seawater that was used for drinking, cooking and bathing.

Sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) conduct a counter-measure washdown to remove potential radiation contamination while operating off the coast of Japan providing humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami. Some 51 sailors involved in the effort are claiming to have been contaminated

Sailors working aboard USS Ronald Reagan during the 2011 tsunami effort in Fukushima, where a nuclear power plant went into meltdown, have been diagnosed with a variety of cancers they claim is a result of radiation contamination

In a lawsuit filed against Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plaintiffs claim the power company delayed telling the U.S. Navy the tsunami had caused a nuclear meltdown, sending huge amounts of contaminated water into the sea and, ultimately, into the ship's water system.

'At our level, we werenâ€™t told anything,' Jamie Plym, who has been fighting bronchitis and hemorrhaging, told FoxNews.com.

'We were told everything was OK.'

'They said as long as the plume was avoided we would be fine.

'But we knew then that something was going to happen.

'Common sense tells you that the wind would blow it everywhere. You donâ€™t need to be a nuclear scientist to figure that out.'

San Francisco Attorney Charles Bonner, who is representing the allegedly cancer-stricken sailors, initially filed a federal suit in the Southern District of California more than a year ago on behalf of a dozen sailors.

Aftermath: Aerial view of tsunami damage in an area north of Sendai, Japan, taken from a U.S. Navy helicopter assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan on March 13, 2011. An earthquake measuring 8.9 on the Richter scale hit the northeast coast of Japan causing a tsunami

The lawsuit was initially dismissed, when the court ruled that any ruling would hinge on interpreting communication between the Japanese and U.S. governments, which could violate the separation of powers.

But Bonner is amending the suit to add new allegations that would fall under the court's jurisdiction.

And the number of plaintiffs has more than quadrupled as more service members come forward with radiation-related illnesses, he said.

'They went in to help with rescue efforts,' said Bonner.

'They did not go in prepared to deal with radiation containment.'

The new suit will be refiled on January 6.

The plaintiffs don't blame the U.S. Navy, which they believe acted in good faith, Bonner said.

It was the plant's operators who sat on the meltdown information during the crucial hours following the March 11, 2011 disaster, he said.

'TEPCO pursued a policy which caused rescuers, including the plaintiffs, to rush into an unsafe area which was too close to the [Fukushima nuclear power plant] that had been damaged,' Bonner charged in an April filing now being updated to add more plaintiffs.

The damaged roof of reactor number No. 1 (L) is seen next to an undamaged reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after an explosion that blew off the upper part of the structure in Fukushima Prefecture, northeastern Japan, March 12, 2011. Japanese authorities battling to contain rising pressure in nuclear reactors damaged by a massive earthquake were forced to release radioactive steam from one plant  after evacuating tens of thousands of residents from the area

'Relying upon the misrepresentation regarding health and safety made by TEPCO, upon information and belief, the U.S. Navy was lulled into a false sense of security.

'The officers and crew of the U.S.S. Reagan (CVN-76) and other vessels believed that it was safe to operate within the waters adjacent to the FNPP, without doing the kinds of research and testing that would have verified the problems known to the defendant TEPCO at the time.'

Nathan Piekutoski, 22, who served aboard the USS Essex, which was in the same deployment as the Reagan, said sailors had no choice but to trust what they were told.

'They did say it was safe at the time,' Piekutoski said.

'We had to take their word for it.'

Piekutowski now suffers from leukemia and, while he is currently in remission, doctors have told him that he may need a bone marrow transplant.

The Pentagon has been monitoring and collecting data on radiation exposure in the region, a Department of Defense spokesman said.

TEPCO officials have not responded to requests for comment.

Soldiers aboard the USS aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan (pictured) were unaware they were being contaminated by radiation while serving in the 2011 Japanese tsunami effort Fukushima and were told by authorities the conditions were safe, claims their attorney

But during a recent meeting before members of the Japanese press on December 12, former Prime Minister Naoto Jan said the first meltdown occurred five hours after the tsunami, not the next day as reported at the time.

Bonner believes the statement means the Japanese government knew radiation was being leaked and did not inform the U.S. Navy.

'They knew there was an active meltdown and they deliberately hid it from the public as well as the Navy,' Bonner said.

'Those sailors went in there totally unaware and they were contaminated as a result.'

Plym says she is prepared to have her symptoms questioned in court, should the case go to trial.

But with so many U.S. sailors coming forward, she believes justice will prevail.

'People will say that out lawsuit is fake and that we are doing this for money, but itâ€™s really about getting the correct information out there,' she said.
