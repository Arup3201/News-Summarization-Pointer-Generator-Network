This is the moment a giraffe gives birth to her calf under the watchful eye of a concerned father.

In remarkable pictures, the giraffe Eura can be seen giving birth to her newborn at the GaiaZOO in Kerkrade, Netherlands.

She then rather touchingly tends to the calf as it lies looking startled on the floor of the enclosure.

The birth, which took place on June 20, followed a 15-month pregnancy.

The calf, pictured, would have dropped two metres during the birth. Giraffes are usually born feet first - breaking the foetal membranes before falling to the ground - severing the umbilical cord

As the giraffe is the tallest living animal on earth - the newborn would have fallen about 6ft 6ins (two metres) during the birth.

Luckily, this calf looks to have survived its fall without any major incident - although it does appear to be a little shell shocked.

The birth comes as another gave birth in front of a jubilant crowd at San Diego Zoo in California.

Spectators waited for two and a half hours for the mother to deliver the creature - with one person even capturing the moment on their camera.

Onlookers are said to have cheered when the calf finally arrived covered in slime moment before a sack of fluid followed.

The giraffe - full name Giraffa camelopardalis - is an African even-toed mammal and is the tallest living creature on earth.

The species name of the animal refers to its camel-like appearance and the patches of colour on its fur.

A giraffe pregnancy usually lasts between 400 and 460 days. Usually, the mother only births one calf - althought twins have been recorded on rare occasion.

The mother gives birth standing up - with the calf usually emerging head and front legs first.

This means the calf breaks through the fetal membranes before falling to the ground and severing the umbilical cord.

The mother will then usually tend to her calf before helping it stand. Most can run within a couple of hours.

Newborns are usually about 5ft 10 in (1.8 metres) tall.
