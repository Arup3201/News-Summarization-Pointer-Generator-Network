A six-week-old baby boy at the centre of a murder probe has been named as
Mohammed Ismail Malik.

His parents, father Shakeel Hussain and mother Rabeel
Malik, are being questioned by Greater Manchester detectives on suspicion of
his murder.

They are also being quizzed on suspicion of causing or allowing the
death of a child.

Police said they are not looking for anyone else in
connection with the boy's death. 

Mohammed Ismail's devastated family described the
little boy as 'absolutely gorgeous' and said that the couple would never
harm a child. 

The youngster was taken by paramedics from the family
home in Heaton, Bolton, to the Royal Bolton Hospital just before
4pm last Thursday.

He was transferred to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in
Liverpool, where he died the next day.

Police were informed of his death at
11am on Saturday and launched an investigation.

Mr Hussain, 24, and Ms Malik,
22, who are believed to have moved into the property just six months ago, were
arrested yesterday morning after a post-mortem examination was carried out.

Further tests are ongoing to establish the exact cause of the baby's death.

The
couple, who have connections in West Yorkshire, were not known to social
services in Bolton.

Mohammed Ismail's grieving aunt, Mr Hussain's sister
Parveen Fardous, said the family have been devastated by his death.

She said: 'He would smile and look around even though it was early days. He was absolutely
gorgeous.'

And she said of his parents: 'They are not capable of doing
such a thing - they would never harm a child.'

Ms Fardous said: 'Rabeel rang
from the police station and she doesn't understand what's going on. My brother
is in shock.'

Ms Fardous added that the family was gathering at her parents'
home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, to support each other.

She said: 'They love
kids. It doesn't make sense to me. They wouldn't harm the child intentionally.

'We're all devastated. It's just heartbreaking - a baby being brought into the
world, then taken away so soon.'

Neighbours told how Mr Hussain ran screaming
into the street.

Deaglan Finn, 46, said: 'A man
just came flying out of the house screaming "My baby's dead, my baby's dead".

'There was a lot of commotion on the street and the parents went into the
neighbour's house and then all the ambulances came. There must have been about
20 paramedics working on the baby.

'They were a quiet couple and they had only
been there for a few months. They kept themselves to themselves.'

Samina Ali,
who lives three doors away from the couple, said: 'They were really nice,
pleasant people and it has come as a bit of a shock.

'They are very quiet but
everyone who knows them says that they are really good people.'

Detective Chief Inspector
Dave Warren, from Greater Manchester Police's Major Incident Team, said: 'Tragically, a very young baby has died and our thoughts are with his family
and friends.

'We are in the very early stages of this investigation but I want
to reassure all those close to the baby and the local community that we are
doing everything we can to establish the full circumstances leading up to and
surrounding his death.'
