The first all-girl rock band to come out of Kashmir has been forced to cancel their live shows after receiving rape and death threats on Facebook.

Award-winning Pragaash, which means light, have been targeted since December when they won a prize at their first public performance.

Following the concert, comments appeared on Facebook from extremists who said the teenage girls should be raped and then drowned.

A Facebook page KashmirNews posted a photograph of the band with a caption stating: 'Personally, I consider them as shameless and spoiled brats...

'A lot of people criticised the girls. Some even went on to say, "Post this status in advance. The three band girls raped in Jammu and thrown in river."'

The band members, Farah Deeba, guitarist Aneeka Khalid and vocalist-guitarist Noma Nazir, refused to talk on the issue but were reportedly shaken by the threats.

Their parents are said to have advised the band to stay out of the limelight for a while and the girls are now believed to be in New Delhi.

Omar Abdullah, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, is one of the most high profile people to speak out in support of the band.

He said: 'Shame on those who claim freedom of 
speech via the social media and then use that freedom to threaten girls 
who have the right to choose to sing.

'I hope these talented young girls will not let a handful of morons silence them.'

He added that police would look into whether any of the people found making threats can be charged.

Adnan Mattoo, owner of Band Inn, a musical academy where the girls trained, said their talent is 'astonishing'.

He was quoted in the Times of India as saying: 'They are just 15 and too young to face such abuse.

'They are hurt. They cried, but I tried to convince them to continue.'

Other supporters have taken to Facebook to defend the band.

One wrote: 'Why the hell are people not minding their own business and let 
the girls live their own lives! It's their choice, who are u to question
them... idiots!'

Another
wrote: 'The f****** who are abusing these girls should be caught and 
then shot. These f****** elements should be cleaned from the society! 
Girls you rock! India is with you...'
