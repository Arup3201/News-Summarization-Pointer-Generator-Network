A brother and sister claim their elderly mother lay dead in her hospital bed for two hours until they discovered her - because nurses had failed to notice she had passed away.

Helen Weldon's body was found cold and with food dried to her mouth at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham.

Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon then faced a 20-minute wait for medical staff to come to their mother's bedside to check her pulse and confirm she had died.

Helen Weldon's children found her dead in her bed at Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital

The 85-year-old from Birmingham was admitted to the hospital for a routine check-up after being taken into A&E when she choked on some water.

Mrs Weldon, who suffered from dementia, was due to be discharged three days later.

But when her children arrived to visit her they realised she was dead.

Despite making a complaint to the hospital days after she died, four years on they have never received a response.

Ms Weldon, 45, gave up her job in IT at Birmingham City Council to care for her mother at home after she became concerned about the care she had received in a hospital two years previously.

She said: 'As soon as I walked through the door and saw my mum I knew something wasn't right.

Mrs Weldon (pictured in her early 20s) is thought to have been dead for as much as two hours, her children say

Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon say nurses had failed to notice that their mother was dead

'I said to my brother - Mum is not OK. She was yellow and her skin was waxy. It was awful.

'She was cold but still had food in her mouth.

'There was a glass of water by the side of her water which had some starch in.

'A doctor had recommended adding it to her drinks to help her swallow more easily.

'But the water in the glass next to her bed had set like wallpaper paste.

Mrs Weldon's children say that even when they raised the alarm it took 20 minutes for staff to help them and to confirm that she was dead. Mrs Weldon is pictured with her daughter, Anastasia

'She must have been lying there for at least two hours for no-one to have noticed.

'She couldn't feed herself - whoever fed her had left as she was and then she couldn't do anything.

'Other staff definitely would have passed her bed in the time that she was lying there dead.

'I approached the staff - they had changed shifts and were standing in a group chatting.

'I told them, "I don't know how to say this but I've just found my mother dead".

Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon say they complained to the hospital but that they never received a response

'She just looked at me blankly and said, "we'll be with you".

'But
 it was 20 minutes before anyone came over. In that time a friend of 
mine had managed to drive from Walsall to the hospital to see me because
 I was so upset and even she arrived before a nurse.

'It was so insensitive and I want answers. I want to know why my mum was neglected.

'The person responsible for the ward wasn't even around to answer my questions.

'We logged a complaint as soon as we got the death certificate a week later but we never had a response.

Just days ago Martyn James says that he also found his mother, Joan James, dead in her bed at the hospital

'I am still haunted by it. I surround
 myself with photos of her in happier times but I can't get rid of the 
vision of her lying there dead.'

Mr
 Weldon, 60, had to pull a curtain round his mother's bed in a bid to 
try and preserve her dignity and not distress other patients on the open
 ward.

A Heartlands 
Hospital spokesperson, said: 'We would like to again send our sincerest 
condolences and apologies to the Weldon family for the care and 
treatment given to Helen Weldon in August 2010.

'This is not the standard of care we aim for and behaviour we expect from our staff.

'We continue to invest in training for our doctors and nurses to ensure we provide the best possible care to all our patients at all times.'

Mr James says when he found his mother (pictured with her grandson, Sam) nurses had no idea she had died

Mr Weldon said: 'The nurses just gawped in shock when we told them.

'We knew she was dead and I pulled the curtain round her to give her a bit of dignity.

'But her starched water had gone solid as a rock, so she must have been there for at least two hours.

'That is the lasting image of my mother I have in my head - it's the stuff of nightmares.'

The news comes just days after a retired policeman claimed he found his mother dead in a bed at the same hospital.

Martyn James, 54, says he found Joan James, 85, 'propped up' and 'cold' when he went to visit her on January 22 last year.

He says nurses at the hospital had no idea she had died until he raised the alarm.
