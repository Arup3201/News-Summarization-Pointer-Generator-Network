Disgraced former CIA chief David Petraeus has agreed to plead guilty to sharing classified information with his mistress, it emerged today.

The former U.S. Army General will plead guilty to one felony count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, according to documents filed in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The plea deal, which Petraeus signed on February 22, shows the government has agreed to recommend no prison time but will enforce a sentence of two years probation and a $40,000 fine.

A judge, who is not bound by the recommendation, will make the final decision. The charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison, a $100,000 fine and five years of probation.

No immediate date has been set for Petraeus to enter the plea.

By striking the deal, he avoids an embarrassing trial that would detail his relationship with Paula Broadwell. He stepped down as head of the CIA after their affair emerged in November 2012.

Documents filed in federal court state that between August 2011 and April 5, 2013, Petraeus did 'unlawfully and knowingly' take classified materials and retain them at 'unauthorized' locations. 

Prosecutors say that while Broadwell was writing Petraeus' biography, he gave her binders of the classified materials that included notes about his discussions with President Obama.

The binders, known as 'black books,' were seized by the FBI in a search of Petraeus' home. He lied to FBI agents about providing them to Broadwell and said he never gave her classified material, according to court documents.  

In late August 2011, he took the books to the home where Broadwell was staying during a week-long trip to Washington, D.C., according to the documents.

He left the books with her so she could use them as source material for the biography, prosecutors said. Days later, Petraeus brought the books back to his home in Arlington, Virginia.

An attorney for Petraeus, Robert Barnett, said he had no immediate comment. 

Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing.

Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him.

She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012.

But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails.

The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two.

As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. 

Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down.

In May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the affair.

'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC.

'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' 

Petraeus was a celebrated general who was credited with helping pull Iraq from the brink of an all-out civil war. President Barack Obama turned to him to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan before moving to him to the CIA in 2011.
