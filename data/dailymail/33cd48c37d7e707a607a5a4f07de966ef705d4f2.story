Build a cubby house in the lounge room, pitch a tent in the backyard, fall asleep together and enjoy some story time - these are some of the family activities on the bucket list created by the devastated parents of a three-month-old who might not live to see her 1st birthday.

Kim Fulko Lim, 29, and his wife Renee, 28, are determined to tick their way through as much of the list as possible before their time with little Maddison, who was diagnosed with a rare brain condition, runs out.

The couple from Camden in New South Wales, had no idea of the emotional struggle they would come to endure during what they described as a regular and healthy pregnancy.

Kim and Renee Fulko Lim's daughter Maddison has been diagnosed with a rare brain condition that wont see her live past her first birthday 

'With this condition Maddison will never reach any milestones. She will never smile, never sit, never support her own head, never eat solids, never talk and the list goes on. This condition is aggressive,' the explained

'It was all normal leading up to the labour and then when Renee gave birth, Maddison was a bit flat - she was unresponsive at first. Then they whisked her away to be resuscitated and check on her and then she finally came to,' Mr Fulko Lim told Daily Mail Australia of the couple's first indication that there was a problem.

A midwife later noticed that the baby had a strange breathing pattern and at less than two-weeks-old, Maddison was put through blood tests, ultrasounds, EEGs, a lumber puncture and finally an MRI which led her to be diagnosed with Pontocerellbar Hypoplasia Type 6.

The condition is extremely rare, with only 16 cases around the world. Maddison presented the first ever case of the illness in Australia.

'The paediatrician told us that the size of her brain - it's under-grown. The parts that are underdeveloped are parts of the central nervous system that allows us to move, talk, walk and look around,' Mr Fulko Lim said.

The now three-month-old spent her first few weeks of life undergoing blood tests, ultrasounds, EEGs, a lumber puncture and finally an MRI, which led her to be diagnosed with Pontocerellbar Hypoplasia Type 6

The couple are determined to spend as much time with their daughter as possible and have begun checking off points on a bucket list of family activities they always imagined themselves doing as a family 

'All those cognitive and motor skills on Maddison aren't there due to that part of the brain being underdeveloped. 

'With this condition Maddison will never reach any milestones. She will never smile, never sit, never support her own head, never eat solids, never talk and the list goes on. This condition is aggressive and will shorten baby Maddy's life to approximately one year.'

When asked if he could remember how he felt when he was told of his child's fate, Mr Fulko Lim said: 'I can remember it clear as day - I was just shell shocked. 

'There are no words to describe it. Our life had just been turned upside down.'

Part of the bucket list included a family holiday to Queensland, where they took this photo in Movie World

A family trip to Sydney's Taronga Zoo was also on the list, where they met giraffes and koalas 

'We want to take her fishing, camping, get a celebrity photo with Kyle and Jackie O, pitch up a tent in the backyard, build a cubby house in the lounge room, fall asleep together, have story time - nothing extravagant'

But the family's heartache doesn't stop there, as they must also watch Maddison suffer through multiple seizures each day.

'The seizures happen because the parts of the brain that are underdeveloped are trying to send messages, but they're being shortened and not transmitting. If it hasn't got the right parts, it won't communicate so they have seizures,' , Mr Fulko Lim said. 

'They happen every time she's awake and even when she's asleep, on and off, on and off about 10 or 12 times.

'It's sad. Seeing that it hurts her, that's when it hurts us.' 

Kim and Renee also have to help Maddison through the multiple seizures she endures each day 

Christmas as a family: Maddison's condition is extremely rare, with only 16 cases around the world. She is the first ever case  in Australia

The family are now reaching out the public for donations so that they can spend each of Maddison's remaining days with her. They have so far reached an overwhelming $27,000 in support since sharing their story three days ago.

'If heaven forbid something happened sooner rather than later – I'll be regretting [not spending time with her] for the rest of my life,' Mr Fulko Lim said. 

Since starting their bucket list, the family have fulfilled a number of checkpoints including a plane trip, going on a family holiday, a visit to the zoo and plenty of pictures along the way.

'They are all just little things we wanted to do as a family and we now have to cram it in in a short time,' Mr Fulko Lim said.

'We're still going through the motions, but this isn't the hard part – it's the easiest part. Just her face and her presence is keeping us going,' Mr Fulko Lim said

'We want to take her fishing, camping, get a celebrity photo with Kyle and Jackie O, pitch up a tent in the backyard, build a cubby house in the lounge room, fall asleep together, have story time -nothing extravagant. 

'If we can, we want to visit family and friends in other states so that she can meet them too. We just have to live out what we can and make the best of what we have.'

'To people in similar situations: I would suggest to love your child and make the most of it. Mourn them afterwards because if time with them is short, you don't want to be sad while they're here - it doesn't make things any easier.
