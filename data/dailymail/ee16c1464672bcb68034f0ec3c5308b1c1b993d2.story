An eerie ghost cloud was seen forming high in Earth’s atmosphere by astronauts on board the International Space Station on Thursday.

‘Saw something launch into space today. Not sure what it was but the cloud it left behind was pretty amazing,’ tweeted Nasa astronaut Mike Hopkins.

That same night YouTube videos revealed incredible footage of the same mysterious glow lighting up the clouds in Russia.

The image was captured from the International Space Station by Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano. His colleague Mike Hopkins tweeted: 'Saw something launch into space today. Not sure what it was but the cloud it left behind was pretty amazing'

Writing on the Above Top Secret forum, NBC News space analyst said: ‘Russia just test-fired a Topol ICBM from the Kapustin Yar range on the lower Volga, to the Shary Shagan impact zone in Kazakhstan.

‘In the past, such launches have been seen over a wide area, as far away as Israel and Syria, and reported as UFOs. ... If the weather was clear, we might expect some spectacular videos to show up on YouTube and RUTube.’

The Topol RS-12M missile is the latest addition to Russia’s military armoury.

Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces carried out a successful test launch of a Topol/SS-25 missile on October 10, 2013.

The missile was launched from Kapustin Yar to the Sary Shagan test site in Kazakhstan.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as this are used as nuclear weapon delivery systems, capable of delivering their payloads thousands of miles away.

The 52 tonne missile has an operational range of 11,000 kilometers (6,800 miles).

The missile plume seemed to have some shape and was composed of gas particles moving at around 10,000 feet per second, according to Oberg.

While astronauts on the space station were able to see the rocket blast, experts claim it posed no threat to them.

‘This wasn't anywhere near a 'Gravity' Hollywood space debris cascade-triggering possibility,’ Oberg told NBC news.

This isn’t the first time a missile launch has been mistaken for a UFO.

Last year, thousands of people in 
Israel, Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon and Jordan called police as a white, 
gleaming light danced high up in the atmosphere.

Theories
 abounded over what it could be - a failing missile test, a satellite 
breaking up in our atmosphere, or a visit from an alien spacecraft.

However, the mysterious light was in fact another Russian missile test.

The spirals of light in the sky were fuel spewing out from the missile as it burned in a fierce cartwheel through the sky, creating the startling geocentric shapes.

In 2009, Norway’s northern town of Tromso was given a similar display. The Russian Defense Ministry admitted later this was a failed test of a Bulava intercontinental missile.

This amazing, mysterious beam was spotted over Norway in December 2009: This was later confirmed as a Russian missile breaking up, with the light display made by the missile spinning as it flew into the atmosphere
