In what marks the first fatality during a Formula One race in more than a decade, a marshal was tragically killed Sunday at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal.

According to a statement issued by the International Automobile Federation, the unidentified marshal was run over by a mobile crane as he was helping remove a car from the track after it had crashed towards the end of the 70-lap race.

'The worker was helping to recover a car which had stopped during the race,' the statement says. 'The recovery vehicle had lifted the car to return it to the pits and 
while doing this the worker dropped his radio and attempted to pick it 
up.'

As the marshal was picking up his radio, he 'stumbled and was hit and run over by the recovery vehicle."

The marshal was helping to retrieve Esteban Gutierrez's wrecked car when he tripped and fell under the wheels of a mobile crane

The man was then airlifted to the Sacre-Coeur
hospital in Montreal, where he was pronounced dead.

'The FIA, l'Automobile Club de l'ÃŽle Notre-Dame and the Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada, want to communicate their deepest condolences to the family and friends of the victim,' the statement says.

The last fatality at an F1 race happened in 2001, when Graham Beveridge was killed by a tire that flew through a gap in the safety fencing after a collision between Jacques Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher.

Prior to that, another marshal was killed at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix. He, too, was struck by a tire that flew off the track during a wreck.

According to Reuters, the death prompted a review of safety procedures at race tracks across the world.

Sunday's race was won by Red Bull's triple world champion Sebastian Vettel.
