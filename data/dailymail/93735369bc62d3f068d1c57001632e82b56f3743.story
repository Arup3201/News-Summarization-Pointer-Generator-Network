An art student who dedicated her A-level project to painting and sketching pictures of her dying mother has achieved top marks for the moving work.

After Denise Powis, 51, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given just months left to live, her daughter Becca chose to stay at home to spend as much time with her as possible.

The 17-year-old pored over old photographs of her mother, a former model, at her bedside and became so inspired by them she decided to centre her art course around them.

Becca's A level art coursework featured paintings and pictures of her mother Denise who died in December

She created seven pieces from Mrs Powis' modelling portfolio which included oil paintings, pencil sketches and watercolour pieces.

Mrs Powis died last December, midway through Becca's course and just three months after being diagnosed with metastatic cancer.

Becca, one of four brothers and sisters left by Mrs Powis, continued working on her A-level project in memory of her mother and submitted it in May.

And despite having just a 52 per cent attendance record in her final year at sixth form, Becca achieved an A* grade in art. She was also awarded the same grades for photography and fashion.

Becca, who lives with her father Barry, a company director, and siblings Gemma, 16, and Ashley and Luke, 13, in Ferndown, Dorset, now intends to study a foundation art course and apply to university.

She said: 'I had started doing my project about the Rokeby Venus painting, but when mum was diagnosed I had a rethink.

'Mum used to be a model when she was younger and so I made my mum my project.

'We dug out all these old photos and newspaper cuttings about her, it was so moving to see her at her most beautiful.

'I was going to school like normal but I found it really hard to concentrate so I spoke to my teachers and they said if I felt more comfortable working at home that was fine.

'My mum was on an electric bed in the lounge so I set up a section in the same room and did all my work from there.

The beautiful pictures include Mrs Powis posing on a car bonnet, winking into the camera, and a stunning black and white portrait

'I think she really enjoyed getting all the albums out and looking through everything again.'

All of Becca's artwork was created from oil paints, sketches, and watercolours and was based on pictures of her mother in 1980 when she was 18.

The beautiful pictures include her posing on a car bonnet, winking into the camera, and a stunning black and white portrait.

Despite having just a 52 per cent attendance record in her final year at sixth form, Becca achieved an A* grade in art

Becca said: 'Mum did lots of beauty pageants and was a former Miss Wimborne.

'I created oil paintings, sketches, and watercolour pieces from some of the photographs and submitted seven in total.

'In a way, I guess it helped me. Sometimes it was really hard to get motivated and I just didn't want to think about it, other times it was a good distraction.

'She was really proud of all the work that I did, I knew I had to carry it on.

'When I found out my results I was really pleased and my dad cried, he was over the moon.'

Mr Powis, a bathroom designer, said: 'I am so very proud that she has got so much strength in her, to concentrate on her studies at such a hugely emotional and difficult time, and I know her mum would be too.

Becca's headteacher Alex Wills, of Ferndown Upper School, also paid tribute to the teenager's courage.

He said: 'She is a very talented and modest young lady who is a great credit to her family and has a very bright future ahead of her.

'All of us at Ferndown Upper School are really proud of this incredible achievement.'
