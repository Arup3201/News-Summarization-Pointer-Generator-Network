A thief snatched a package right off someone's doorstep yesterday--and it was all caught on tape.

Diana Lougnot of North Glendale in Phoenix, Arizona was shocked to see a man pull up to her home in a white SUV, grab the package on her doorstep, and walk away with her personal property.Â 

At first the woman thought her package was late but after looking at footage on her surveillance system she'd had for only a month, she was able to identify foul play as the culprit.

'The nonchalant attitude with which he does that is just shocking to me. It's just something else,' said Lougnot to CBS 5.

'It was like no big deal to him. You could tell from the expression on his face. It was just, 'Hey the package was there, let's just take it.'

'This was two hours later and so I believe that he just drove by and saw the package sitting by the door,' she said.

The male suspect unknowingly took a pair of women's shoes, which luckily the shoe company offered to replace for her.

Lougnot had her next package delivered to work, something that Fedex recommends for safety if the home is not a viable option.

Coincidentally, this was not the first package stolen in Phoenix that day. Two hours earlier, another white SUV pulled up to another driveway and stole a package.

Even though the SUVs look similar, it's not the same car. The two SUVs have different rear view and backseat windows with different door handles and hubcaps.

A Fedex spokesperson told CBS 5 that couriers are instructed not to leave packages at people's doorsteps if they feel that is is safe to do so.

The Mail Online spoke with the Phoenix police department who said that they are still looking for the suspect behind the package theft. Those with information are asked to call (602) 262-7626.
