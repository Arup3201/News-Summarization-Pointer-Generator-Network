The blue tracksuits and white trim of Lionel Messi and the Argentina squad stood out like beacon in the stands as the Indiana Pacers took on the Washington Wizards on Wednesday. 

The World Cup finalists took time away from their training camp in the Capital ahead of Saturday's friendly against El Salvador to lend their support to countryman Luis Scola, who was in action for the visiting team. 

Messi and Barcelona team-mate Javier Mascherano appeared to be particularly enjoying themselves as the in-stadium camera singled out the former Ballon d'Or winner as the Pacers edged out the Wizards 103-101.

Gerardo Martino's side have been training at Georgetown University and will be there all week in the lead-up to their match at FedEx Field, home to the Washington Redskins. 

Hundreds of spectators turned out to their session on Tuesday and although it was supposedly closed to the public, Messi and Co were happy to sign some autographs for locals at Shaw Field.

They turned spectators from a private box to watch Scola, the 34-year-old Argentine who stands 6ft 9in to Messi's 5ft 6.5in and whose career also took him from South America to Spain where he starred for Basque club Saski Baskonia in the Euroleague. 

The NBA came calling though in 2007 and he's lined up for the Houston Rockets and Phoenix Suns before his 2013 move to the Pacers.
