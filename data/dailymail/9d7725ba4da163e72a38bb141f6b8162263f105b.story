Jodi Arias said last night that she would prefer to be given the death penalty rather than life in prison after she was yesterday found guilty of first degree murder.

Because of her emotional state, Arias is now on suicide watch as she awaits her sentencing hearing which begins today.

'The worst outcome would be natural life because longevity runs in my family,' she told MyFoxPhoenix.

Speaking out: Jodi Arias gave an interview to a local news station just minutes after the verdict and she said that she hopes she gets the death penalty because she doesn't want to 'spend the rest of my natural life in one place'

'The worst outcome would be natural life. I would much rather die sooner rather than later because Longevity runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and  I'll probably live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward to.

'I believe death is the ultimate freedom and I'd rather have my freedom as soon as I can get it.'

The interview took place in a holding room inside the courthouse just 20 minutes after the verdict was rendered.

And now, because of the suicidal comments she made in the interview as well as prior threats, police have put her under psychological watch to insure that she does not hurt herself while in court custody.

The moment: Arias showed little reaction when the verdict was read

Since she admitted that she killed Alexander, there was no chance that she would have been found innocent, but the question of whether or not she planned the murder or whether it was committed as an act of self defense.

Today five members of the 12-person jury found it was premeditated and the seven others found that it was both premeditated and a felony murder.

'It was unexpected for me yes because there was no premeditation on my part,' she said in the interview.

'The whole time I was fairly confident that I wouldn't get premeditation because there was no premeditation.'

She said that she would have 
understood if they simply found her guilty of felony murder 'because of 
the way that the law is written' but also attributes some of her own 
actions that caused the jury not to believe her.

'I can understand that because of the lies I told in the beginning, to try to cover this and hide that,' Arias said.  

Spectacle: Court officials told the public that the verdict was going to be read three hours before it actually happened, giving followers time to gather outside of the Maricopa Courthouse

She took shots at prosecutor Juan Martinez, who she sparred with for weeks during her questioning.

'Prior to trial, I respected Juan as a capable attorney even though he’s done some very shady things in my case as far as hiding evidence,' she said in the Fox interview.

'In the end what does it matter it doesn’t help my case.'

Some of the hundreds of Alexander supporters who gathered outside of the courtroom awaiting the verdict held posters praising Martinez, one even suggesting he runs for governor of Arizona.

Arias said that she was 'overwhelmed' and 'went blank' following the verdict, but showed little emotion.

She did not apologize to the Alexander family, saying only that 'now that a verdict has been rendered that they can find peace, or some semblance of peace.'

When asked what she would do if she were to go back to the moment when she was standing by her car in the desert with her hands covered in Alexander's blood, she said that she would drive directly to the Mesa, Arizona police department. In the courtroom, she repeatedly said that she did not know what she would have done.

Though she has been separated from her original pod of cellmates, Arias said that she got a sense of how big the trial was getting when new inmates would enter the prison and seek her out.

'They want to shake my hand, they want to give me a hug. They want my autograph- I'm not going to sign anything,' she said.

Arias was originally scheduled to speak to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren at 10pm on Wednesday, but now that she is on suicide watch, she may not be able to grant media requests.

The jurors will reconvene tomorrow to begin the two-part process of deciding whether or not she will receive the death penalty.
