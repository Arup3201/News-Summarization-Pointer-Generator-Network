There's nowhere to hide when a goalkeeper makes a mistake as young Everton stopper Jindrich Stanek found out on Monday afternoon.

While the Toffees' Under 21 side beat their Leicester City counterparts 3-2, Stanek had a game to forget as two glaring errors cost Everton two goals.

The 18-year-old Pole, signed from Sparta Prague in January, made his first blunder on 38 minutes as he failed to clear Ryan Ledson's back pass and sliced the ball into his own net.

Things got worse five minutes after the restart - Stanek received a pass in his area and managed to beat an oncoming Foxes attacker but then over-hit the ball before hauling down Tom Hopper in the box.

Hoping to make amends, the Everton keeper was unable to keep out the resulting penalty from Jacob Blyth as the youngster's afternoon went from bad to worse.

Meanwhile, Ledson marked his 17th birthday by signing his first professional contract with the club on Tuesday
