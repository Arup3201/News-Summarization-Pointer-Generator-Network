Cristiano Ronaldo would be a perfect match for Monaco. It should be no surprise they tried to lure him to a poser’s paradise where security is as high as the tax is low, and where the yachts are as big as the dogs are small.

You can picture the hair gel glistening in the sun as his Ferrari glides by Casino Square. It is not so easy to envisage him performing to sparse crowds at the Stade Louis II, but maybe one day it will appeal.

‘It’s true we met Ronaldo,’ nodded Vadim Vasilyev, Monaco’s vice- president and right-hand man to billionaire owner and president, Dmitry Rybolovlev. ‘I know Ronaldo, but it was not quite on.

‘We were joking one day he might come. He likes Monaco, the project, and our president, they know each other. We sat down with Ronaldo but knowing we were looking a bit more in the distant future. We did not enter into serious discussions with Wayne Rooney, but we had contact about signing him. We were almost at the point of meeting Rio Ferdinand but he did not want to come.’

These targets were set in the heady days after the Rybolovlev takeover saved AS Monaco from relegation to the French third tier and the threat of extinction in December 2011, and then restored them to Ligue 1 within 18 months.

Since then, strategy has changed. A-list players are no longer such prime targets. Stars like Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez have left, but the ambition remains to keep this club at the top.

‘Monaco is an attractive place,’ said Vasilyev. ‘Families and wives of players fall in love with it. For some, it’s important to have a stadium full of 60,000 fans. For others, it is to have the feeling and security this country can offer. With equal terms, some players will say no, no, not Monaco, and others will say yes, yes, every time. This was the case with Falcao.’

When Falcao moved on loan to Manchester United, soon after James had been sold to Real Madrid, fans protested and rumours were rife Rybolovlev was bored, feeling the pinch of his divorce or had fallen out with Prince Albert, after failing to acquire Monegasque citizenship.

These were refuted by the owners, who put the policy shift down to UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules and a £41.5million bill from the French FA to offset the club’s tax-free status.

‘To jump-start the project, massive investments were needed,’ said Vasilyev. ‘Our president is a very ambitious man and we accomplished what we did. But since the summer 2013, I said: “Look, there won’t be massive investments.”’

FFP rules squeezed this club, with its tiny fan base inside a nation with a population of 35,000. ‘Nobody wants an unfair competition,’ said Vasilyev. ‘The trick is how to implement this in real life. Is the recent (£5billion) TV rights deal in England unfair to other European clubs? Can they compete at the same level when Premier League clubs can buy almost any player?

‘Under these rules, a project like Chelsea or Manchester City is no longer possible. Is it good big clubs stay big and small ones stay small?’

One arm of Monaco’s new strategy is to revert to the strengths of the era when Arsene Wenger was in charge, producing talent like David Trezeguet, Lilian Thuram and Thierry Henry. Leonardo Jardim’s squad is the youngest left in the Champions League, even with Ricardo Carvalho (36) and Dimitar Berbatov (34) boosting the average age to 23.9 years.

‘When we signed Ricky (Carvalho) there was so much criticism because of his age,’ said Vasilyev. ‘But when I met him for the first time, at night in Madrid, in his jeep so no one would see us, I recognised his positive personality and it has helped us a lot.’

Another arm of the plan is to lean on Monaco’s global appeal and association with its Royal Family and Grand Prix. The club crest has been redesigned to include the word Monaco rather than the initials ASM and this season’s team photo was taken at the opulent Opera de Monte Carlo.

‘Monaco is a historic club — one of the major clubs in France — and the ambition was always to give back this identity,’ said Vasilyev. ‘We are unique. We consider ourselves part of the principality, which stands in this world for many things: luxury, sports, ecology.’

They are into the knock-out stages of the Champions League for the first time in a decade and the draw against Wenger’s Arsenal laces the revival story with emotion.

‘Wenger is revered as one of the great coaches in Monaco history and one of the iconic coaches in modern football,’ said Vasilyev, but he quashed the idea the 65-year-old may return to the club he led to the French title in 1988.

‘We have to accept Arsenal is a different level in European football. He has been there for nearly 20 years and done an amazing job. We have the greatest respect but to come back to Monaco is not on the agenda. We are going for coaches who still have to grow and prove themselves and develop as part of the project.’
