Alan Pardew suffered his first defeat as Crystal Palace manager in frustrating fashion as his side failed to respond to conceding an early goal against Everton.

It was bitty, gritty and grinding from Everton. There were delayed free kicks and balls pettily poked away when the whistle had gone.

But that is exactly what is required for the relegation battle manager Roberto Martinez admitted his team are now in. And it worked.

Pardew and counterpart Martinez had barely taken up position on the edge of their technical areas when Romelu Lukaku bundled the ball in from close range.

Given the contrasting fortunes of the sides in recent times — Palace on the back of four wins since Pardew took over and Everton with just one victory in 13 — the visitor’s early lead was a shock.

Only two minutes were on the clock when Steven Naismith was played down the right and had time to power in a low ball.

Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni could only palm the cross into the sliding Lukaku. He was lucky, the ball cannoned off his knee and went in.

Three minutes later, parity was almost restored when Dwight Gayle cleverly flicked the ball past Joel Robles in Everton’s goal. The effort was bouncing over the line until Phil Jagielka rushed back to clear.

‘Whoever invented that goal-line technology needs a kick up the bum,’ joked Palace manager Pardew afterwards.

The resulting corner fell to Yaya Sanogo, whose low shot was destined for the bottom-right corner but the strike was cleared again.

Pardew said last week, following the FA Cup fourth-round win over Southampton, that he would have sleepless nights deciding who to play up front after Gayle, Marouane Chamakh and loan signing Sanogo had all scored. He opted to throw them all into the melting pot which resulted in early Palace pressure, despite going behind.

But Pardew’s hand was forced 21 minutes into the match, regardless of his intentions, when Chamakh leapt to head the ball and instead smacked into the back of Seamus Coleman’s skull.

Blood spurted from Chamakh’s nose and his face and hands were covered in claret as the striker was carried off on a stretcher. ‘He’s got a broken nose, we fear,’ said Pardew. ‘Fingers crossed he doesn’t get my cold. He wasn’t concussed, but it was a heavy blow to the nose with a cut on it as well.’

Jordan Mutch came on to make his debut following a £5.75million move from Queens Park Rangers on Thursday.

Palace proceeded to dominate possession as Everton retreated into their defensive shell for the remainder of the first half and well into the second. Palace’s next good chance came in the 57th minute when Gayle delivered an inviting ball into the box from the left-hand side and Sanogo got a head to it but directed his effort just wide.

Their attacks continued to flow —without managing to click in the final third — and so did the blood, this time Scott Dann going down with a cut above the right eye and blood gushing after clashing with Lukaku.

But for all Palace’s dominance without end product, Everton had the clearer chances of the second half. They almost added to their lead on 78 minutes when Aiden McGeady played an angled ball between defence and goalkeeper and Lukaku came sliding in again but could not connect with the ball.

With three minutes remaining, McGeady then bent an effort towards the left corner of the goal but Speroni pulled off a diving, one-handed save.

‘We don’t live in a hermetic chamber,’ said manager Martinez. ‘We know we’re playing catch-up in the league. We want to be in a better position.We had to be perfect to get the three points because we played a team full of confidence who have been scoring goals.

‘Eight in the last three games — that shows you the form they had. It was very professional, strong intent from the beginning to win the game.

‘When you score early you’re going to be tested and you have to defend the box well, but we managed the game very well.’
