These photographs show the scenes of sheer poverty in a remote part of the world’s newest country where children are deeply malnourished and surrounded by violence every single day.

The pictures from Leer in South Sudan show starving children, burnt-down homes and youngsters playing with dangerous military hardware.

They highlight the plight of the country where more than 1.3million people have been forced to flee their homes because of widespread violence.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the Security Council on Monday that he visited South Sudan this month in order to 'sound the alarm about the violence and the risk of catastrophic famine'

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned that if the fighting continues, half of South Sudan's 12 million people will be displaced, starving or dead by the end of the year

More than 1.3million people have been forced to flee their homes in South Sudan because of widespread violence which started in December

Many have spent months living in an area referred to in the country as ‘the bush’ - the untamed wild where dirty water and disease lie in wait.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the Security Council on Monday that he visited South Sudan this month in order to ‘sound the alarm about the violence and the risk of catastrophic famine’.

He warned that if the fighting continues, half of South Sudan's 12 million people will be displaced, starving or dead by the end of the year.

People who have fled the town in recent months are only just starting to return to their homes, many of which are now burnt-out or empty.

With the rain season upon the country, many families have been left without a roof over their head and have been forced to either stay with neighbours or live out in the rain.

Sarah Maynard, a project coordinator with the Doctors Without Borders organisation which is trying to help those most vulnerable, said: ‘To be living in a place where you don't even have a roof is awful.

‘With the rain coming it will only get worse. People need help here.’

Doctors Without Borders has started offering support and help to severely malnourished children again after the aid group's hospital was destroyed in violence that has been ripping apart the country since December.

The group re-opened its clinic doors last Thursday to a flood of residents seeking help for malaria, measles, diarrhoea, respiratory tract infections - and hunger. The group screened 600 children and found 50 faced the most dire level of malnutrition.

Nyagaaw Biel Dhoar brought two-year-old son Jacob Rit Wadaar to the clinic in the hopes that the medical personnel could save him. She tried to keep breastfeeding him as he lay dying in her arms, but he died the next morning.

Government troops led by President Salva Kiir and rebel forces loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar battled each other on Sunday, only two days after the pair met in Ethiopia to sign a cease-fire deal, the second peace treaty of the conflict. The first one fell apart soon after it was signed.

World leaders like the U.N. 
secretary-general and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry both worked to 
get Kiir and Machar to agree to the latest cease-fire because the aid 
community says that if residents don't return home this month and plant 
crops before the rain properly sets in, the country will have no food to
 eat.

‘Hunger and malnutrition are already widespread. If this planting window is missed, there will be a real risk of famine. That is why we are calling for 30 days of tranquillity backed by both sides. I am troubled by the accusations by both sides of breaches of the cease-fire already,’ Ban told the Security Council.

He said South Sudan still needs £465million for aid operations this year. A donor conference is being held in Norway in one week.

Violence has upturned the rhythm of daily life in the country.

Although her home and grain store has been reduced to a burned-out shell, she keeps returning to it in the hope of finding something that might have escaped the looting fighters and their fires.

‘This was my home,’ she said. 'It was burned by the soldiers.They killed three of my children and they took all the sorghum and whatever we had in our house. 

‘Now we are left to die without any food, water or shelter. They have taken away everything.’
