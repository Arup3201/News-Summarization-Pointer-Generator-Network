A 27-year-old Florida woman is accused of killing her newborn baby girl in the shower after giving birth then hiding the infant's body in her bedroom inside a plastic bag.

Maria Macdalena Castillo told detectives that she didn't know she was pregnant when she began giving birth in the shower in late April.

Castillo was arrested Wednesday following confirmation from the state medical examiner that the baby was alive at birth.

Manslaughter: Police say Maria Castillo gave birth in the shower then put the baby in a plastic trash bag and hid her under clothing in her bedroom

She is being held at the Hernando County Detention Center in lieu of $30,000 on a charge of aggravated manslaughter.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Castillo told detectives she became scared when she went into labor while showering on April 28 in the Brooksville apartment where she lives with her mother and adult siblings.

She allegedly gave birth to the baby girl then put her in a trash bag which she concealed beneath some clothes in her bedroom.

The child remained in the bag for about an hour before Castillo's brother went to the bathroom to take a shower and discovered what had happened.

Grisly discovery: Family members discovered the baby in Castillo's bedroom and attempted to resuscitate her without success

Family members made Castillo open her door and entered the bedroom where they found the baby girl partially covered by clothing.

Her brother began CPR, reports the Tampa Bay Times, while her mother called 911.

The baby, which was at full-term, was pronounced dead at the scene after efforts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful.Â 

Castillo's family told detectives that they were unaware that she was pregnant.

The baby girl's cause of death was listed as asphyxiation, hemorrhage and inattention at birth.

Neighbors told Bay News 9 that Castillo may have had been developmentally impaired.

'I was really shocked,' said Bertha Brown. 'I just really don't see her as knowing what actually happened.'

Brown said she had often seen Castillo riding her bike in the neighborhood with a man around the same age.

'My heart goes out for her, because I don't think she was aware of the seriousness of really being pregnant,' said Brown.
