Just last week the ardent tennis fan wrote a guide to Wimbledon for Vanity Fair in her new role as contributing editor. 

And Pippa Middleton made sure to follow some of her own guidelines - one of which was bring an umbrella - as she arrived to take in the Andy Murray match at Queen's tennis club today.

Wearing a mint green knit twinset by luxury brand Cashmere By Tania, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge arrived with a male friend to spend a changeable afternoon in the west London tennis club.

In her new vanity Fair column last week, Pippa advised Vanity Fair readers to bring 'everything from sunblock and sunglasses to a 
mackintosh and umbrella' and to wear comfortable shoes.

And as the clouds gathered and the heavens opened over Queen's today, her precautions must have come in very useful.

Days after her guide to British tennis was published in Vanity Fair, Pippa Middleton arrived with a friend at Queen's tennis club to take in the Andy Murray match today

Pippa's dress was the £430 Tita by Cashmere By Tania

Pippa is of course a keen tennis fan - and wrote in Vanity Fair last week of her childhood dream of winning Wimbledon.

The article saw Pippa describe the tournament as 'the highlight of my summer', and recalls her first visit to the All England Club at the age of eight.

She says that she was an aspiring professional tennis player at the time, and remembers purchasing a postcard of the women's championship trophy and writing on it: 'I will win this one day.'

The British weather proved as changeable as ever, forcing Carole and Pippa to take cover under a brolly

Pippa was at Queen's for the fourth day of the AEGON Championships. She wore £130 earrings by Davina Combe

She admits that as a child, she imagined she would get married in tennis whites, 'shorts with no pleats or frills.'

Pippa, who is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 35, tells readers that she has now grown out of her tomboy phase, but that said, there will still be 'no white dresses this summer, apart from at my local tennis club.'

She says a favourite Wimbledon memory was queuing with her sister on People's Sunday in 2004 to get £35 tickets for Centre Court.

Pippa arrived early for the match, which will see Murray take on French hope Nicolas Mahut

Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears arrived to watch the game - she rarely misses her boyfriend play.

Chic as ever, Kim opted for a casual look - jeans and simple cotton top - but let her stellar accessories do the talking.

Think a blue spotted scarf by Beulah - a brand often worn by the Duchess of Cambridge and, in fact, run by one of her friends - and the latest It bag from Mulberry, the Willow, which has a zip-off clutch bag attached to the front.

Unsurprisingly the loyal girlfriend of Andy Murray made the game - and Kim Sears accessorised her casual look with a Beulah scarf and Mulberry's hit new Willow bag

Kim watched her boyfriend beat French hope Mahut 6 -3 - but he faces a tough day as he takes on Matosevic in a second match at 7pm

Kim was happy with the first result of the day - but would be well aware that Murray needs all his reserves to take on yet another match just a few hours later
