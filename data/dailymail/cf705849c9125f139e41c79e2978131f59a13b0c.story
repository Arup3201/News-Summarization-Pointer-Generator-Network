Leading pharmaceutical companies are 'giving up' on a cure for Alzheimer's after the failure of several high-profile trials.

Drug firms are scaling down the search for new Alzheimer's treatments after spending millions on late-stage trials which have collapsed in the past five years.

Last month Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson pulled the plug on the experimental drug bapineuzumab after the failure of two high-profile clinical trials.

Scrapped: Drugs companies have lost millions in recent years on failed Alzheimer's drug trials

Both said they had scrapped plans for further studies of the drug in its injected form.

Shares in the companies fell after the news was announced. Eli Lilly, which is developing a similar drug, also took a hit.

Dr Eric Karran, science director at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, believes some form of public-private drug initiative may be needed to meet the massive cost of large patient trials.

Dr Karran said pharmaceutical companies were becoming less willing to gamble on dementia treatments.

A number had scaled down their neuroscience teams, notably Astra Zeneca.

The company, which once had a 300-strong neuroscience task force, now ran a 14-person 'virtual' team in Boston that co-ordinated research done by others but conducted none itself.

'It's a legitimate concern,' said Dr Karran. 'A company's role is to have a return on investment. Its board and shareholders exercise certain pressures; that's capitalism.

U.S. firm Pfizer, along with Johnson & Johnson, are just two companies who have scaled down their search for Alzheimer's treatments

'On the other hand the medical need is just massive. There's a societal need for these drugs, clearly.

'I think, rather than big pharma doing this by itself, there will have to be more public-private ownership of these massive trials.

'It will require a different way of thinking to bring these drugs forward.'

A major problem is that currently there is no way to diagnose early stages of Alzheimer's disease in people who show no symptoms.

The changes taking place in their brains can only be uncovered by pathologists after death.

By necessity, trials to date have involved patients in whom the disease has already made significant progress.

Alzheimer's is believed to begin with sticky protein deposits called amyloid beta plaques accumulating in the brain. This causes a cascade of events, leading to the destruction of neurons and as much as 30% of the brain's weight being lost.

The process may begin 10 to 15 years before symptoms appear, scientists believe.

In certain inherited cases, the onset of symptoms is much earlier but follows the same pattern.

Researchers have been looking at drugs that reduce levels of the dangerous 'long' form of amyloid beta and delay progression towards symptomatic disease - possibly for the whole of a patient's lifetime.

But they would have to be administered early, at the unsymptomatic stage. This presents enormous difficulties for conducting patient trials, said Dr Karran.

New Alzheimer's treatments were essential to curb the soaring cost of the disease as people lived longer lives, he added. Dementia was already costing the UK economy Â£23 billion a year.

'Care is critical but it's very, very expensive,' said Dr Karran. 'Until we have drugs or other interventions that delay the onset of or slow progression of the disease there will not be enough money or carers to look after the number of people who have Alzheimer's.

'There has to be another solution for society because otherwise dementia and the social costs will escalate and one wonders how the country will be able to afford that.'
