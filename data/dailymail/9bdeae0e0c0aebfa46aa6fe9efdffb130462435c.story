Vicarage Road was awash with emotion on Saturday afternoon as Watford performed a show of solidarity for Nic Cruwys, the fan left fighting for his life in hospital.

Cruwys was shockingly set upon by a group thugs on his way back to Wolverhampton train station from Molineux last week and is in a critical condition.

The 44-year-old had been in the Midlands to watch his side draw 2-2 in the Championship.

Watford’s players warmed up with t-shirts reading ‘For Nic’ and the club dedicated their matchday programme to him with the message ‘thinking of Nic - showing the strength of the Watford FC family’.

Members of Nic’s family were given a rousing reception on the pitch before the game against Reading, with all four sides of the stadium on its feet in applause - then mirrored just before the break.

A banner behind one goal simply read: ‘Best wishes Nic “Moo”, we are all thinking of you... From your Watford FC family.’

Two teenagers, 13 and 18, have been arrested and bailed until April after the attack.

Chief executive Scott Duxbury wrote in the programme to address the ‘horrendous events’ of seven days ago.

‘Everyone who works for Watford has had Nic Cruwys in their thoughts since last Saturday’s sick and unprovoked attack,’ Duxbury said.

‘I’d like all Watford fans to be aware just what a positive impact the support you’ve shown towards Nic and his family has had. 

An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has raised more than £25,000.

‘Nic was simply enjoying a day out at an away match with his friends when he suffered a callous, calculated and unprovoked assault. Any one of us coming away from the stadium could have suffered as Nic has.

‘You’ll no doubt be aware of the online fund set up to benefit Nic and his family. The total raised is now £25,000 and, while money cannot wipe away what has happened, I am aware that the gesture has been extremely well received.

‘In closing I find it very difficult to come to terms with what has happened. I can only take solace from the fact I know everyone connected with this football club will do everything to help and support Nic.’

Sixteen-year-old Ollie Floyd, a Wolves supporter, whose idea it was to start the fund was interviewed and given a warm reception on the pitch at half-time.
