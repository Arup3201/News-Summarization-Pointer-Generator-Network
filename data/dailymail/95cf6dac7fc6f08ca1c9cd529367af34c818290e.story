World leaders were today urged to focus on growth more than budget cuts this year as fears deepened that recession in Europe will slow the global economy.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts global growth of 3.25 per cent in 2012, slower than the 4 per cent it projected in September.

In turn, the 17 nations that share the euro will shrink 0.5 per cent this year, compared to its forecast for 1.1 per cent growth four months ago.

Europe's recession should only have a modest impact on the United States, which the IMF believes will grow by 1.8 per cent growth over the same period, unchanged from its September estimate.

But the global-lending organisation warns against steep budget cuts, which it says will slow growth further and undermine market confidence, running against the push for budget cuts advocated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

It comes as the single currency fell back from three-week highs and world stocks stumbled today as the latest setback in efforts to restructure Greek debt triggered more worries about the outlook for the region.

Oil prices also fell as investors focused on the chances of a Greek debt default that could hit energy demand.

Eurozone finance ministers rejected 
as insufficient an offer made by private creditors to help restructure 
Greece's debts when they met in Brussels today, sending negotiators back
 to the drawing board and raising the threat of a disorderly Greek 
default.

'It's back to 
worrying about whether Greece is heading for a soft, messy or technical 
default,' Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global 
Capital in New York, said.

The euro last traded at $1.2964 against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, a fall of 0.49 per cent.      

In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said that in light of weaker growth European governments should avoid extreme austerity measures such as spending cuts and tax increases.

And healthier European countries whose
 governments are facing lower interest rates 'should reconsider the 
pace' of their short-term budget cuts.

IMF managing director Christine Lagarde made a similar argument on Monday during a speech in Berlin.

European banks, meanwhile, are cutting back on lending in order to boost their capital reserves, the fund said. That's likely to hammer Central and Eastern European economies this year, which depend heavily on European bank loans.

The cutbacks will also slow growth in many Asian economies, the IMF said, where European banks finance a big chunk of the region's exports.

Still, the hit to China will be relatively modest - it is forecast to grow 8.2 per cent this year, down from the fund's earlier projection of 9 per cent.

U.S. policymakers should take steps to rein in the long-term costs of government health programs and Social Security, the federal public pension system, the IMF said.

But those cuts should be phased in over the long-term. Immediate cuts could slow the economy further.

One reason the IMF expects the U.S. economy to remain sluggish is because governments at all levels will likely cut back on spending.

The IMF assumes the Social Security payroll tax and extended unemployment benefits will be extended for the full year. Last month, Congress agreed to extend them only through February.

Without a full extension of both measures, the U.S. economy will fare much worse, the IMF said.

Lagarde warned yesterday that the world economy faced the risk of a painful recession this year.

She called on policymakers to avoid the stalemates that prevented Europe and the United States from resolving difficult budget and economic problems last year.

'It is not about saving any one country or any one region,' she said. 'It is about saving the world from a downward economic spiral.'

The IMF's projections followed a similar mark-down in global growth estimates last week by the World Bank.
