Her last words before she was shot to death by her daughter's boyfriend were: 'I'm not dead yet', prompting the gunman to return and shoot her again - this time fatally.

The lone survivor of the shooting rampage Candice Moten, from San Antonio, testified against her former boyfriend yesterday, telling the court he shot dead her mother, sister and unborn child after they accused him of slashing their car tires.

She told jurors she watched as 32-year-old James Morrison gunned down her family outside their apartment in April 2009 after the couple had been arguing.

Survivor: Candice Moten told jurors she watched 32-year-old James Morrison gun down her mother and younger sister outside their apartment in April 2009

Mother: Laura Moten, 46, yelled out 'I'm not dead yet' prompting the gunman to return and shoot her again fatally

Sister: Krystle Moten, 23, also died in the shooting rampage at their San Antonio home in April 2010

Accused: Morrison's lawyers claim he acted in self defense, fearing for his own life because the women each weighed more than 240 pounds and were aggressive and violent

Candice - who was five months pregnant at the time - was shot in the abdomen. She survived, but her unborn child did not.

She said Morrison came to their home to slash their tires and when they came out to confront him he pulled out a gun and started firing at them.

'He shot us, period, and then (my mom) yelled
out, "I'm not dead yet" and he came back and shot more,' Candice Moten told the jury. 'He shot more
after she yelled at him.'

Morrison's defense lawyers say he acted in self defense.

They have argued he feared for his own life because each of the three women weigh 240 pounds and were being aggressive and violent towards them.

Attorney Joel Perez pointed out that is client is only 5' 8" tall and at the time weighed only 160 pounds.

The
three women were described as the aggressors to the court, according to MySanAntonio.com and the jury were told Morrison only opened fire to 
fend the women off after a struggle.

He is charged with capital murder in the shooting deaths of Laura Moten, 46, Krystle Moten, 23, and Candice's unborn child who she later named Angel.

Candice was in hospital a week before she learned that her three family members were dead.

Morrison was not the father of the unborn child. He could face the death penalty or life in prison if convicted.

Perez quizzed Candice about the sworn testimony she gave earlier to the court.

Damage: The argument started after Morrison slashed the tires of the vehicles in the driveway

April 2010: Candice Moten was shot in the abdomen, she survived but her unborn child did not

She told the jury she and her then-boyfriend had been arguing all night and that he had been drinking vodka and beer right before the shooting.

It was while she was on the phone to 911 about the tire slashing incident that he shot at her. He then shot her sister and mother as they tried to escape, she testified.

Perez told the court the three women charged him all at once and his client started shooting because he was trying to get away.

Under cross-examination, Candice denied this but acknowledged that she, her mother and sister could be violent. She later downplayed this, saying her mother and sister were 'verbally violent', according to mysanantonio.com.

The trial continues.
