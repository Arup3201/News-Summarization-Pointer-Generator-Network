Coleen Rooney arrived in Brazil last night in the midst of a Twitter row after being accused of 'dragging' her children to the World Cup.

The 28-year-old wife of Wayne Rooney hit back asking why people are 'so thick' after she was accused of going to Rio just to 'get another holiday.'

The spate started after Coleen posted a photo of her and her two young sons - Kai, four and Klay, one, on the social network in their England kit next to the caption: 'We're off!! Come on England!!'

In response Twitter user Ash McFadz ‏ wrote to her: 'Dragging a 4 year old and a baby half way around the world...just so you can get another holiday.'

The wife 
of the £300,000-a-week Manchester United striker retorted: ''Why are people
 so thick!!! so we can support and see our daddy/husband'.

It is not the first time the wife of the £300,000-a-week Manchester United striker has been trolled during the World Cup.

On Monday she bore the brunt of the bitter disappointment of England fans after their defeat against Italy.

Social
 media users reacted angrily in light of the fact that they did not 
believe star player Rooney had lived up to his reputation as a 
footballing great.

Coleen viewed Ipanema beach from her hotel balcony today as she waited to meet husband Wayne hours after he had taken part in a vital England training session.

A place in Roy Hodgson’s England side is far from certain for the Manchester United star as the team prepares to face Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday.

Coleen appeared on the balcony of her Rio de Janeiro hotel and was thought to be talking to Wayne  on her mobile phone in the early part of the morning as she enjoyed her first full day in Brazil.

Coleen 
arrived at her £500 a night beachfront boutique property late on Monday 
night - after a marathon 15 hour journey from Manchester via Heathrow - 
and finally checked in just after 10pm local time ( 2am GMT).

With her were her parents Tony and Colette and her two sons - four year-old Kai and thirteen-month-old Klay.

The
 Rooney clan are hoping to see Wayne play in Thursday’s vital game 
against their South American opposition but last night it was still 
unclear whether the player would start the vital clash in Sao Paulo .

Excited: Coleen Rooney leads her family through Manchester airport to catch a flight to Brazil for the World Cup

Family trip: Coleen brought her sons Kai and Klay and some other relatives to support her husband Wayne Rooney

Big load: The family brought along around 15 suitcases as Coleen said she'll be staying for the whole campaign

Defender: The mother-of-two has been taking on Twitter trolls who have criticised her husband's performance in the England v Italy game

Critics
 say he should be on the substitute’s bench for the  game after a 
lacklustre performance in England’s opening 2-1 defeat against Italy in 
Manaus last Saturday.

Rooney
 enjoyed a morning off yesterday before training with the England team 
and Roy Hodgson’s squad are due to fly to Sao Paulo early on Wednesday 
morning in preparation for their crucial game.

Later
 Coleen appeared on her balcony again – this time minus her phone - but 
sporting a bright pink bikini topped with a flowing chiffon top.

Meanwhile
 , it will be for England manager Roy Hodgson to decide if Rooney is the
 right man to wear the ‘Three Lions’ shirt when we play Uruguay.

The family weren’t able to be in Rio for the first match, but the mother of two guarantees she’ll be cheering Wayne on throughout their campaign, however long that may be.

Good luck: No doubt Wayne will be hoping his family's presence will spur him on and not let the critics mess with his head on the pitch

Mascot: Kai wore an England kit with matching Nike trainers and his father's number on the back

Matching: Baby Klay also sported an England kit and his daddy's number

'We're off!': Coleen shared a cute picture of her and her boys on their way to Brazil

England’s next game arrives on Thursday, where they’ll be taking on Group D rivals Uruguay, who also lost their first game, to Costa Rica 3-1.

Since 1953, the national team has won three, drawn three, and lost four games against the South American side, and so far only three teams in the last century have ended up overall winners after losing their first match.

The England v Uruguay game will take place at the Arena de Sao Paulo, and kicks off at 8pm.  

Support: Wayne will be hoping to beat Uruguay after England's 2-1 defeat to Italy
