Rumours were swirling Moscow last night about the health of Vladimir Putin who has not been seen in public for more than a week.

The Russian President had been due to make a visit to Kazakhstan this week but an official there said it had been cancelled because he was ill.

Mr Putin also failed to appear at an annual meeting of high-ranking officers from the Federal Security Service today, an event he has attended in past years.

Last public appearance: Vladimir Putin with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Russia last week

It was claimed the crisis over Ukraine and murder of an opposition politician may have caused a collapse in Mr Putin's health.

But another theory, advanced by the lawyer of murdered Boris Nemtsov, was that the strongman may be lying low because he is 'afraid' of an assassination bid.

Rumours: The Ukraine crisis may have contributed to a collapse in Putin's health, it has been claimed

Putin loves to be seen as an ever-present action man, but the Russian president has been absent from public view for a week.

The 62 year old's unusual absence has dented his tough-guy image.

His aides scrambled to explain he was healthy and his macho handshake remained so strong 'it breaks your hand'.

Putin was last seen in public when he met with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on 5 March.

Official pictures have emerged of meetings since then, but rumours say these in fact took place earlier before his sudden and unexplained disappearance.

Nemtsov's lawyer claimed Putin may be scared over the high profile murder yards from the Kremlin, suggesting the Russian leader maybe in hiding fearing an assassination bid.

'Perhaps Putin, even completely sincerely, was bewildered and even afraid,' said Vadim Prokhorov.

'Because if you can do that next to the Kremlin, then is it not possible to do it along the route of the presidential motorcade?'

Spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the health speculation over Putin as 'spring fever'.

The leader was 'holding meetings all the time' to solve the 'crisis'.

'There is no need to worry. Everything is fine,' said Peskov, not explaining why Putin did not make an appearance to disarm the rumour-mongers.

The spate of speculation over his condition recalled regular health scares over his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and a clutch of geriatric Soviet leaders.
