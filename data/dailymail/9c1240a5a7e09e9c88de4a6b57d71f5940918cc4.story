A Mexican national deported from the US four times has been arrested in Texas for allegedly molesting a nine-year-old girl and stealing her underpants.

Israel Andrade, 35, allegedly broke into the Springtown home early Saturday morning and groped the girl in her sleep, before motioning for her to join him in a bedroom. 

Andrade's arrest and the multiple failed attempts to keep him out of the country has sparked calls for tighter security at the US-Mexico border, with local sheriffs peititoning the federal government for more resources.

Charged: Mexican national Israel Andrade, 35 (pictured), was arrested for allegedly breaking into a Texas home Saturday morning and molesting a little girl before fleeing with stolen goods

CBS reported the girl told Parker County Sheriff’s deputies she was roused from sleep by a man groping her private areas. She had been sleeping on the couch with her siblings.

She said the man, who spoke in broken English, beckoned her to follow him into a bedroom where he broke into the home. He fled when the girl ran screaming to her parents' room.

According to CBS, the girl's mother was forced to drive to a convenience store to call police as the suspect allegedly stole the family's cell phones and computer.

Investigators found Andrade at a relative’s house about a mile away, where he'd been staying for about 30 days after returning from Mexico. Police said he was found sleeping on one of the stolen phones.

According to Dallas News, police also found two pairs of the child’s underpants stuffed in the suspect's jeans and a pair of tennis shoes with a tread pattern matching footprints at the girl's home. 

Andrade was charged with burglary of a habitation with intent to commit another felony, indecency with a child by sexual contact - a first-degree felony.

Immigration and Naturalization Service records obtained by the sheriff's office found Andrade had been deported from the US in July 2003, February 2004, September 2009 and December 2010

Parker County Sheriff Larry Fowler said Andrade's deportation history proved the need for tighter security along the southern border.

'Our border Sheriffs and the Texas Department of Public Safety are doing a phenomenal job with the current laws and available resources,' Fowler said in a statement.

'Yet our Federal Government needs to step forward and aid us in enforcing the laws on our southern border. This type of injustice cannot be allowed to pass by for a sixth time.

'How long will we have to tolerate this type of injustice? It is time for American citizens to make a stand and begin petitioning for tighter security at our borders in order to protect our citizens.'
