These incredible pictures show how a police chase ended early this morning when a suspect's car slammed into a house, coming to rest inside a bedroom and on top of a sleeping man.

The tenant - Michael Sweat, 34 - was pinned under the vehicle in Hamden, Connecticut, for about an hour while firemen tried to free him. He suffered burns but his injuries were not life-threatening.

The five-mile long chase began at about 12:30am on Tuesday after officers spotted the vehicle and determined that the driver was wanted for motor-vehicle violations, New Haven Police said.

Crash: A suspect's car slammed into a house, coming to rest inside a bedroom and on top of a sleeping man

Scene: The suspect lost control of his BMW in the Newhallville area of New Haven, slamming into a corner house and crashing through the home's façade

The officers tried stopping the SUV, a BMW X5, but the driver led them on a pursuit through the Southern Connecticut State University campus and into New Haven.

Hamden police dispatchers notified New Haven police, and told them officers had tried to stop the vehicle using ‘stop sticks’, which the suspect swerved to avoid, authorities said.

The suspect lost control of his BMW in the Newhallville area of New Haven, slammed into a corner house and crashed through the home's frontage, New Haven Police Officer David Hartman said.

The BMW ended up fully within a first-floor bedroom and on top of Mr Sweat, who was asleep in his bed, Officer Hartman said. But the suspect fled the scene.

With Mr Sweat pinned under the car, firemen checked the home's structure and used ‘manual and pneumatic tools and timber to shore up the BMW and the home itself,’ Officer Hartman said.

The process took about an hour, during which time Mr Sweat received ongoing medical attention from paramedics and a doctor. Once freed, he was taken to a waiting ambulance and on to hospital.

He suffered second- and third-degree burns to his buttocks and lower extremities, but his injuries were not considered life-threatening, Officer Hartman said.

New Haven firemen, police and city building inspectors were expected to remain at the scene for the several hours on Tuesday morning while the BMW was being removed from the home.

Police are continuing to search for the suspect, and have asked the Connecticut State Police to help.
