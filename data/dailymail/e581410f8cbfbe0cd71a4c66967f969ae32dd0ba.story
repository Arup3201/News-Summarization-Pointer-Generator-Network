Three members of an all-girl punk band standing trial for hooliganism apologised for causing any offence caused to churchgoers when they performed an anti-Vladimir Putin song in Russia's top Orthodox cathedral.

The three young women said they had wanted to change Russia with their action but could have made an "ethical" mistake by offending worshippers.

Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29, and Maria Alekhina, 24, face up to seven years in jail if found guilty , but they maintain they are innocent to the charges.

On trial: Three members of feminist punk group Pussy Riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova , left, Yekaterina Samutsevich, right and Maria Aliokhina, centre, are on trial for putting on an anti-Putin performance in a Moscow cathedral

Initial hearings in the trial earlier 
this month saw the court order the three members of punk rock group 
Pussy Riot to stay in detention until January 2013, a move their 
supporters condemned as travesty of justice.

All three told the judge at the 
Khamovnichesky court in Moscow they were innocent of their charges, in a
 process that is growing into a landmark event in the struggle between 
President Putin and Russia's emboldened opposition.

In February, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 
Yekaterina Samutsevich and Maria Alekhina climbed into an area reserved 
for priests in the Church of Christ the Saviour and performed a "punk 
prayer" against Putin.

The trio were all arrested in March and charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred of Orthodox believers.

A further ten members of the band, 
supporters and a few selected journalists were also present during the 
demonstration but were never arrested.

Riot Grrls: The three co-accused has apologised for offending visitors to the cathedral saying it was not meant to upset churchgoers and that their performance was only political

They have been held in detention ever 
since and their case has been taken up by celebrities including pop star
 Sting and US rockers the Red Hot Chili Peppers and become a new 
rallying cause for the opposition against Putin.

After the three girls, all dressed 
casually, confidently declared their names, places of residence and 
birthdates to the judge, their lawyer Violetta Volkova read out 
handwritten statements in their names.

'The action was a desperate attempt 
to change the political system. We had no intention of insulting people.
 We did not expect our punk appearance would cause offence,'mother-of-one Nadezhda Tolokonnikova said in a statement.

'The fact we do not accept guilt in 
the charges does not mean we are not ready to admit our mistakes. If 
someone was insulted then I am prepared to accept that we made an 
ethical mistake,' her statement said.

They said the motivation for their 
action was a protest against the support in elections for Putin by 
Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill which was against the principles of 
Russia's secular constitution.

The trio may be jailed for up to seven years which  would be devastating for Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, left, and Maria Alekhina, right, who both have young children

Samutsevich added: 'The main theme of all our texts was not (Orthodox Christianity) but illegitimacy of the elections".

'The calls (by the Patriarch) to vote 
for Putin and not go to the protest rallies are clear violations of the 
principles of a non-religious state.'

'I don't understand the ideology of 
the prosecution,'Â  Maria Alekhina , known as Masha, said after the 
prosecution read through its statement. 'I don't understand why a 
conclusion is made about our motives.'

The father of Yekaterina Samutsevich, 
Stanislav, said he had little hope of mercy for his daughter. "Of course
 they are going to be put in jail. It is a political trial."

In an interview with The Times 
newspaper released by the government on Monday, Prime Minister Dmitry 
Medvedev called for calm over the ongoing case, but acknowledged that it
 had 'resonance' for the public.
