Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has revealed striker Sergio Aguero could be missing for up to six weeks due to knee ligament damage.

The Argentina ace has smashed 19 goals for the champions this season, but limped off in the opening minutes of Saturday's 1-0 Premier League defeat of Everton.

Pellegrini, speaking in Italy ahead of the Champions League game against Roma, confirmed Aguero had undergone a scan.

However, he refused to put an exact timescale on the forward's recovery.

When asked about  Aguero's condition, Pellegrini said in a press conference: 'He is injured and cannot play tomorrow. We will see how long he will be out, but it's more important to think about the players we have for this very important game in Rome.

'It is difficult to know the exact amount of weeks he will be injured, Maybe four, five, six weeks, it depends on the time it takes him to recover.

Aguero has smashed 19 goals in 21 games for City so far this season and will be a big miss

‘His recovery will depend on the first weeks, it's an important stage right at the beginning. Players know this. But as I previously said our team doesn’t depend on one single player and I hope my players can prove it tomorrow.'

Pellegrini has a near full squad to choose from to face Roma, with the exception of Aguero and the suspended Yaya Toure.

The City boss added: 'They are all in the squad list except Sergio and Yaya. We will see tomorrow which are available to play but all of them, I think they could be ready for tomorrow. Maybe one of them we have some doubts, but I won't say which one.'
