Hundreds of die-hard chicken sandwich fans swarmed Chick-fil-a locations in three states Wednesday, where they set up parking lot tent cities in bone-chilling bids to win a year's worth of free food.

The campers hoping to be among the first 100 customers at new stores in Kansas, Virginia and South Carolina lined up just as the current polar plunge brought the weeks lowest temperatures yet this season across much of America.

Because the stores weren't slated to open until 6am Thursday, the campers braved the frigid night as temperatures plunged to as low as -10F for some.

Campers at the Derby, Kansas opening faced those lowest of lows and, perhaps unsurprisingly, only around 50 people had set up their tents and portable heaters in the lot as the sun set Wednesday.

As such, 50 more lucky breakfast customers would be rewarded with a coveted gift card loaded with some $32,000 worth of free food, reports MyFoxDC.

Campers at the  Northern Virginia location were slightly more fortunate than their Kansan comrades, but not by much.

Hundreds packed the lot in Dumfries Wednesday as overnight lows plummeted to near zero and relentless wind chills made the temperature feel like 10 below.

The campers' got what they came for as doors opened early Thursday and they were treated to a raucous welcome from store staff--one dressed as the chain's cow mascot--in addition to the massive gift cards.

The most fortunate of the lot spent their nights waiting for a Powdersville, South Carolina store to open.

While the most southerly of the day's openings, the Palmetto State's came during a stretch of uncharacteristically low temperatures.

Even as the doors opened Thursday, and hours after, weather authorities in the area warned of dangerous wind chills that could feel as low as 10 below.

'My husband said I'm nuts,' South carolina camper Joy Boudreau told WLOS on Wednesday evening. 'He packed me two sleeping bags, an air mattress, a bed roll and I think he's bringing by another blanket. He thinks I'm crazy, he's staying home nice and warm.'

In Kansas, only around 50 had lined up by Wednesday evening, meaning  50 more lucky breakfast customers would be rewarded with a coveted gift card loaded with some $32,000 worth of free food
