Davide Santon’s fiancee claims Newcastle United forced the Italian to quit the club and says she is disgusted with the treatment of her partner.

Chloe Sanderson - who has a child with Santon - says the 24-year-old initially rejected an offer from Inter Milan before being told by the Magpies to rejoin his former club in a loan deal, which will be made permanent in the summer.

Miss Sanderson tweeted: ‘Just to put it out there, Davide declined Inter Milan's first offer but was pushed out by Newcastle United to leave.

‘Disgusted with how Davide has been treated, fully fit for a while now with no chance to play- a club whose only intentions are to make £££’.

She went on: ‘This is not just a loan, it’s a loan with obligation to buy.

‘Newcastle as good as told him if he stayed he didn’t have a place in the team.

‘They tried to deny it this morning, to keep it on the down low so other teams wouldn’t put in an offer for JUST a loan, because Davide would have preferred that, to stay in the Premier League, but Newcastle would have lost the guaranteed buy and money.

‘They are a business not a club. And as long as they keep losing players with the passion Davide had, they are killing NUFC, and killing the support from the fans who stick around after all the s***.’

Newcastle strongly refuse the suggestions made by Miss Sanderson and her tweets have since been deleted.
