Victim: Sofia Liu, 6, died after being struck by a driver who was waiting to pick up an Uber client on New Year's Eve

Car service app Uber is now facing its first major legal hurdle after being named in a wrongful death lawsuit after one of its drivers hit and killed a 6-year-old girl.

Sofia Liu died on New Year's Eve after an Uber driver, Syad Muzaffar, hit her and injured her mother and brother.

The suit was filed in San Francisco today meaning the company faces its first true test as it argues that they are not responsible for the driver since he did not have an Uber customer in the vehicle at the time of the accident.

Uber is an app that allows users to call a car to their location, and drivers can log into the service whenever they want to receive clients.

The 'free market' approach to this issue is important because it is up to the drivers when they want to participate- as opposed to a typical livery company where the drivers clock in and clock out at set times.

Instead, the only similar aspect that the company has is the fact that drivers are technically 'logged in' to the Uber app from the moment they put themselves on the virtual map for users to call them.

The larger question that looms over the wrongful death case is who should be in charge of regulating Uber? And when does the company stop being responsible- or, in this case, start being responsible- for the behavior of their drivers, who essentially work on a freelance basis?

Mr Muzaffar had been working for the company for one month at the time of the accident, at which point he was arrested for suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and cooperated with the police throughout the investigation.

Responsibility: The driver, Syad Muzaffar (left), was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, but lawyer Chris Dolan (right) argues that the company was negligent because of how they made the app in the first place

Technical case: Uber drivers are required to be 'logged in' to the device even when they don't have a client in the car, and it is not hands-free compatible meaning that it could be seen as breaking California law

He owns the Honda Pilot that he was driving, and he considered his work for Uber to be his full time job.

Even
 though Mr Muzaffar's income from Uber was his main livelihood, the 
company did not view or treat him any differently from other drivers- 
some of whom may work for a number of car services at the same time.

The company maintains that the use of the app does not make them liable, but the victim's mother believes it does.

The New York Times reports
 that the family's lawyer, Chris Dolan, argues in the suit that the app 
does is not compatible with hands-free technology, meaning that while 
the drivers are logged in- responding to a taxi request or simply 
waiting until they get a call- they are unable to use a hands-free tool.

Drawing a line: The company's co-founder Travis Kalanick, seen here in Sydney in 2012, says that the company is not responsible for the drivers using their app when they do not have a passenger in the car

'Uberâ€™s claims that they are not responsible for injuries caused by Uber drivers who are logged on to the system but not carrying a fare flies in the face of hundreds of years of law,' Mr Dolan told the paper.

'New technology does not eliminate well-established legal principles.'

The family is suing Uber and the driver, Mr Muzzafar, for wrongful death, negligence, negligent hiring, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

'Cabdrivers who are looking for fares are scanning the streets. Uber drivers looking for fares are looking at their phones,' Mr Dolan said.

One of the lawsuit's main points is that Uber's parent company 'is the insurance certificate holder for the insurance that Uber is required to carry as a Transportation Network Company by the (Public Utilities Commission), which it uses for its Uber X operations'.

They are calling for a jury trial and have not set an amount of compensation that they hope to be awarded.

Travis Kalanick, the man who founded Uber four years ago, got 'testy' when questioned about the case in an earlier New York Times interview.

This is not the only public relations issue that Uber faces at the moment, but after it was valued at $4billion, the co-founders are taking each threat to their power as a serious concern.

He would not speak about the case specifically- likely for legal reasons- but said that the company has since deactivated Muzaffarâ€™s account and he has not been able to drive any other Uber clients ever since the accident.

'We work our butts off to go above and beyond what is expected even by the regulators, including insurance, background checks,' Mr Kalanick said.

'And so it always comes back to, did Uber do something wrong?'
