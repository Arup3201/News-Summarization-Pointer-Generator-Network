Matthew Jordan, whose body was found in Windermere in Cumbria after he went missing 

The inquest into the death of a student whose body was found in a lake has been halted after it emerged his iPhone was still working despite it apparently being in the water with him for three weeks.

Matthew Jordan, 20, a criminology student from Middlesbrough became separated from three friends during a night out in April, sparking a massive search of Lake Windermere in Cumbria, where his body was found.

It has also emerged that a mysterious man captured on CCTV walking through the graveyard of a nearby church and then doing a quick u-turn around the time the student went missing has not come forward, despite police appeals.

The inquest at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria was stopped after the barrister for Matthew's family, Kieran Rainey, complained of too many 'gaps' in his final hours and said there were 'unanswered questions'.

Mr Rainey told a witness giving evidence for Cumbria Police: ' You've got a blank spot on this and you're giving evidence today which is completely divergent to what the family understands.'

Coroner Ian Smith said he did not want the family to go away 'unhappy', but warned all the answers may never be known.

Matthew's mum Claire, 43, told the inquest her son was good at directions and cannot understand how he ended up on Rayrigg Road, close to Windermere, as it was in the opposite direction to the cottage where he was staying.

She said: 'There's still a gap and we are still adamant people have seen him on Rayrigg Road that night and that Matthew would have asked them for help.

An unexplained bruise on Mr Jordan's head was also found during a post mortem but a small cut to his eye was 'missed'.

Several 'figures' in 'groups' on the streets that night have not been traced, a detective revealed.

Mr Jordan a Teesside University student, had travelled from Middlesbrough with three friends on a spontaneous trip to the Lakes.

The group ate and drank at pubs including The Stag's Head Hotel where they got split up around midnight.

Mr Jordan was told to go to the toilet after being sick but the group got split up and he was last seen trying to get help at the The Hole Int Wall, which was closed.

His three friends - Michael Blakey, Jordan Gill and David Russell - estimated he had drunk around six-and-half pints of lager, some shots and half-a-bottle of wine.

His post mortem examination showed he was two-and-half times the drink drive limit, which on its own was not sufficient to kill him, the inquest was told.

While he was described as 'swaying', witnesses said he was sufficiently 'coherent' to ask for help and speak to people.

The last contact his phone had with the network was at 12.31am.

Specialist police teams and a marine unit searched Windermere for Mr Jordan after he went missing following a night out with friends 

Mr Jordan had not been drinking regularly due to a fitness regime, the hearing was told.

His cause of death remains 'unascertained' - partly because of decomposition after he was found in the water at Rayrigg Wyke, just off the A592 on Rayrigg Road near the Windermere Steam Boat museum.

CCTV footage from the museum showed the security lights activating around the time of his disappearance but there is no-one or any animals on film - which detectives cannot explain.

Consultant pathologist, Dr Nicholas Mapstone, is also unable to explain bruising on Matthew's head.

He said: 'There are a number of things I didn't find and it leaves me with a problem

'Although it's not uncommon in drowning.

'There was no definite evidence of drowning but that doesn't exclude drowning. Two possible causes are drowning and hypothermia.'

Detective Sergeant Andy Lamb, of Cumbria Police, said the operation to find Mr Jordan was ‘comprehensive’

Dr Mapstone said the bruise was not serious enough to be fatal but 'was caused when he was alive.'

However, he added that the bruise could also have been due to his position in the water.

But the Lancaster-based consultant pathologist believes there was 'no evidence' of Matthew being assaulted but said he was not a 'forensic pathologist'.

Detective Sergeant Andy Lamb, of Cumbria Police, said the operation to find Mr Jordan was 'comprehensive' with hundreds of statements taken and CCTV footage examined.

He said it was the first missing person search in Cumbria on such a scale in years.

DS Lamb said: 'Has someone hit Matthew? I've certainly not come across any material or any witness that suggests otherwise.

'I think, having heard all the evidence and reviewed all the statements, the hypothesis which has the most likelihood is that Matthew has been drunk, perhaps fallen over, and ended up in the lake and to do that, he would have had to cross a field.'

Floral tributes were left outside the Winderemere steamboat museum near to where Mr Jordan's body was found 

Asked how Matthew's body could have ended up at Rayrigg Wyke, DS Lamb said: 'It's fairly common in Windermere - it has a strong current underwater and various vegetation that someone could get caught up on, or then move around.'

A mysterious man captured on CCTV walking through the graveyard of St Mark's Church and then doing a quick u-turn around the time Matthew went missing had not come forward despite police appeals, he said.

DS Lamb said they had spoken to who they believed the person to be, who had said he was at home on the night.

After the inquest Matthew's family said in a statement: 'There is no criticism of anyone in this matter. The issue is that, there is a gap in the evidence for the period between Matthew leaving the 'Hole in the Wall' to the time when he entered the lake.

'We understand that there is further evidence which was not produced at the inquest and our solicitor will be requesting sight of that evidence in the hope that this will provide a clearer picture of events.'
