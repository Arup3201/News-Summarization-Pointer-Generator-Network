Prince Charles today paid a moving tribute to Lynda Bellingham as a 'marvellous actress' as he backed her work to get more older people into work.

The Prince of Wales said he was 'greatly saddened' by her death from cancer this week, praising her 'tireless' work for other people.

It came as it emerged 2 million people watched the Bellingham's final interview on Loose Women - double the show's usual audience.

Prince Charles (pictured today at the launch of a report about the economic challenges facing over 50s) paid tribute to the work of actress Lynda Bellingham, who died this week after a long battle with cancer

Bellingham, best known for her long-running role as a mother in the Oxo TV adverts and as presenter on Loose Women, had been fighting colon cancer, which later spread to her lungs and liver, after being diagnosed in July last year.

For two years she had been an ambassador for the Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise (Prime) which helps the over-50s start their own companies. The organisation is now part of Charles's charity Business In The Community.

Charles reflected on her work at the launch of a report that found Britain must make better use of older workers, for the benefit of the country and their own financial well-being.

He told delegates attending the launch seminar in central London: 'Before referring to the work of Prime, I did just want to pay, if I may, a special tribute to Lynda Bellingham, who was, as many of you know, a wonderful ambassador for Prime.

'Personally I was greatly saddened to learn that she had passed away this week. As you know, she was not only a marvellous actress but also someone who worked tirelessly for others. So she really will be hugely missed.'

Bellingham's final appearance on Loose Women, screened yesterday, was watched by 2million people, as she spoke to Janet Street Porter and Coleen Nolan about her illness

Bellingham's final appearance on ITV's Loose Women was screened yesterday, three days after her death.

The programme recorded a peak audience of 2 million, a million more than usual, according to ratings figures.

Viewers saw her describing her hopes for the Christmas she would never see.

She assured her friends and colleagues that all would be 'fine' and said she longed to be remembered for her honesty.

Bellingham died in the arms of her husband, Michael Pattemore, at the age of 66 after cancer spread from her colon to other parts of her body.

She recorded her last interview earlier this month, saying she was 'obsessed' with Christmas and was determined to see one more.

'Bloody right I am! I am. I AM,' she insisted, during the interview with Janet Street Porter and Coleen Nolan in front of a studio audience, which included Mr Pattemore.

Bellingham had been invited to attend today's event with Prince Charles some time ago but had declined due to her illness.

Bellingham was an ambassador for the Prince of Wales' Prime campaign to encourage more older people into the workforce

The study, co-produced by Prime and the International Longevity Centre UK, claims a 'missing million' of ageing workers who have unwillingly left employment had the potential to offer invaluable skills and experience.

It said up to 1.5 million people aged 50-69 had left work over the last eight years due to a combination of redundancy, ill health or forced early retirement and of these, 1.1 million people wanted a job.

Older workers could be an important resource for the nation as the report predicts there could be a shortfall in the jobs market, with 13.5 million vacancies needing to be filled over the next 10 years and only seven million young people projected to leave school and college over the same period.

Charles told delegates: 'For what it's worth, to me one key fact revealed by this research is that employing older people does not mean younger people are crowded out of the labour market.

'The number of jobs in the economy is not set. There is room to employ younger people and older people in a mix of skills and experience that creates better business.

'This research makes it clear that older workers are not a burden but a valuable asset.'
