Apple's yet-to-be-announced iPad Mini has apparently been revealed in full for the first time in the best set of pictures yet leaked on the internet.

Sonny Dickson, a researcher for fansite 9to5mac.com, published the images on his Twitter feed yesterday, sparking a wave of excitement among Apple enthusiasts.

The images show a device that is significantly smaller than the regular iPad. According to rumours it boasts a 7.85in liquid crystal display, making it a rival to Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire.

Is this the finished iPad Mini? This picture, published to Twitter, appears to show the completed version of Apple's hotly anticipated new device

The mini is thought to be 7in diagonally, compared to the 9.7in of the full-size iPad.

This would allow it to be used easily on public transport, and fit into a (large) jacket pocket.

TrustedReviews is predicting the mini - which some are dubbing the iPad nano - will use a 1,024 x 768 pixel panel.

The images also show the iPad Mini utilises the controversial new connector introduced with the iPhone 5, which has made all accessories available to previous Apple gadgets obsolete at a stroke.

It emerged yesterday that Apple had instructed suppliers in China to manufacture 10million of the new smaller tablet computers, showing faith in their product in the face of stiff competition.

Insiders say the iPad Mini will be announced on October 17, a few days from the releases of Amazon's Kindle Fire and Microsoft's Surface tablets, and go on sale November 2.

As yet, however, Apple has not officially confirmed any of the reports, rumours of leaks about a smaller iPad.

Apple's 9-inch device dominates the 
market, but smaller, cheaper tablets have been eating away at the iPad's
popularity. The iPad mini is expected to so on sale around the world on
November 2nd, according to online speculation.

The launch date was reported by Fortune magazine, which cites Apple investors hearing the date from 'multiple sources'. The
device is believed to have similar hardware to last year's iPad 2, but 
reduced to a pocket-friendly seven or eight-inch form.

Samsung plans to unveil a smaller version of its popular Galaxy S III smartphone, pictured right, in Europe tomorrow.

It will be very similar to the original, but will feature a 4in screen, placing it in in direct competition with the iPhone 5, which also has a 4in screen.

Samsung's original Galaxy S III, unveiled in late May, has a 4.8-inch screen. Strong sales of the flagship phone helped Samsung post record $7.3billion operating profit between July and September.

'We think there's strong demand for 4-inch screen models in Europe,' JK Shin, head of its mobile business, as said today.

There had been market speculation that Samsung would launch a stripped out, cheaper version of the Galaxy S III to win market share in the mid- to low-end smartphone segment.

However, Samsung said the Galaxy S III Mini would not be an entry-level model.

Fortune reports that Apple will send 
out invites for the launch on October 10, gathering tech journalists and
stakeholders together to unveil the device.

Amazon,
meanwhile has already enjoyed huge success in the US with its updated 
Fire tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time 
on the 25th October.

The gadgets, are available in both 
7-inch and 8.9-inch versions (although only the 7-inch version is 
currently set to go o sale outside of the US).

The third contender is Microsoft, with its Surface tablets.

The
firm will launch the Surface tablet at the same time as Windows 8, the 
latest version of its desktop operating system, which experts say is a 
'make or break' time for the firm.

'It's a dangerous game, as all three firms are trying to steal each other's thunder,' said Tom Wiggins of gadget magazine Stuff.

'Apple tend to be more cagey.

'If I was Apple, and knew that Microsoft
was launching, I'd probably try and come up with something to take the 
focus away from them - and nobody else can do that in quite the same way
Apple can.'

Wiggins believes that Microsoft has so far played its cards close to its chest with the Surface tablet. The firm has not even confirmed a price for the gadget.

The Mini launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per 
cent - own a tablet, with another three per cent regularly borrowing 
someone else's tablet for web browsing.

About 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year.

The U.S. survey by the Pew Research Center also suggests the flood of
cheaper tablets, such as the Google Nexus or Amazon Fire, are weakening
Apple's grip on the market.

A year ago, Apple had more than 80 per cent of the market, but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent.

The Kindle Fire has 21 per cent of the market, meanwhile Samsung's Galaxy tablet has eight per cent.

Out of those surveyed, 44 per cent of adults who said they have a 
smartphone, 46 per cent have an Android phone, 38 per cent, have an 
iPhone and 10 per cent have a Blackberry.

'Microsoft
is the most interesting - it's a make or break thing for them, as they 
have always struggled with touchscreen interfaces.

'It has the potential to be a success - but the worry is that it will be overcomplicated compared to the iPad.'

However, it is Apple's iPad mini that is expected to attract most attention.

'The iPad mini is potentially huge,' said Wiggins.

'But
a lot will depend on price. There are a lot of people who would like an
iPad but can't afford one, so if it does launch and is £250, it will be
very difficult for anyone to beat.'

Experts also believe that Amazon's 
Kindle, which is being launched outside the US for the first time, could
be let down if not enough content is available.

The gadget uses Amazon's own app and film and book stores.

'Kindle Fire is a difficult one, especially in the UK,' said Wiggins.

'It
is dependent on its content delivery, and they will have to have a lot 
of UK content at launch for it to work - but Kindle is a very strong 
brand now..

However, Wiggins also believes that the technique could also backfire - by confusing consumers.

'It is quite possible consumers will get confused,' he said.

'After the iPhone launched, a lot of competitors came out, and people did get confused.

 

Most secrecy has surround the iPad Mini, a shrunken version
of Apple's market-changing tablet, is expected to launch on October 17,
with the device available in shops on November 2.

Steve Jobs famously ruled on a smaller iPad, saying 'The current crop of 7-inch tablets are going to be DOA, dead on arrival.

'We don't think you can make a great tablet with a 7-inch screen.'

However, devices like the Amazon Kindle and Google's Nexus 7 have shown that there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public transport, causing Apple to reportedly change its mind on an 'iPad mini' with a 7 or 8 inch screen.

The firm has reportedly placed orders for ten million of the devices, which are also likely to feature the firms controversial new connector.

If Apple follows previous form, the event will be held in San Francisco, with a simultaneous launch on London.

Images purporting to show the iPad 
Mini suggest a device measuring 7.85inches, with an aluminium back-cover
similar to the most recent iPad.

It is likely to sport a rear-facing 
camera and come with Apple's newest 'lightning' connector, a 
controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers 
obsolete without an adapter.

If Apple follows its usual design 
styles, it is likely to come in white and black versions, with a choice 
of WiFi only, or a 3G option. However this unconfirmed.

The device, while still likely to garner a premium price-tag, will help Apple compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market.

The 7-inch Google Nexus tablet sells for £159 for the cheapest version, while Amazon is also producing a budget tablet range.

Steve Jobs was 
unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success, seeing it as a 
poor compromise between a tablet and a phone.

However Apple appears to have had a change of heart, particularly now that the tablet market has now matured.

One issue Apple might face by launching a Mini is a fragmentation in its core product lines.

Until the release of the iPhone 5, 
Apple's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution, meaning 
apps did not need redesigning for different devices, a problem that plagues the competing Android platform.

But with the increased screen size of
the iPhone 5, some apps now have a black border, at least until the 
developers update their apps, and this problem may now afflict Apple's 
tablets, depending on the final size of the Mini.
