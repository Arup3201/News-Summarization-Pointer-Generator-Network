Verity makes her departure from Emmerdale in this week's explosive episodes

Verity Rushworth's honeymoon seems like it might be permanently on hold.  She and her husband Dominic were due to fly to the Maldives earlier this year, when she was asked to return to Emmerdale.

Now, having worked for five months on the soap's major summer storyline leading up to her dramatic departure this week, Verity says the couple only have one thing on their minds - and it's not lying on a beach.

'We're both exhausted and really need this honeymoon,' says Verity, who married theatre director Dominic Shaw in March.

'Most people would just book it. But we're thinking, "What if a job comes in?" You could say we're workaholics! Dominic is working at the Edinburgh Festival and I'm already auditioning for other roles, so I might be tied up in another drama by the end of the year.'

Yorkshire-born Verity's been in the thick of the action since joining Emmerdale as troublesome Donna Windsor in 1998, aged just 13. Her storylines included killing her headmistress in a hit-and-run accident, attempting suicide with an overdose and catching a sexually transmitted disease. Later, Donna joined the police.

In 2008, however, Verity thought she risked being typecast and decided to spread her wings. She won roles as Penny in West End musical Hairspray, and as Maria in the UK tour of The Sound Of Music. But Verity, now 28, was lured back by the promise she'd be at the heart of a blockbuster plot. 'I jumped at the chance,' she says.

The plot involved Donna, who's dying of asbestos-related lung cancer mesothelioma, bringing her five-year-old daughter April back to the village so the youngster's father Marlon Dingle can care for her.

Desperate for money for April's future, corrupt copper Donna teams up with crook Ross Barton for a series of robberies, including one this week. 'There's a hostage situation, where Donna has to make a split-second decision that will have tragic consequences,' Verity reveals. 'It will really shock viewers.' 

'I'm very proud of Donna's final scenes, which include  a dramatic robbery and a hostage situation . She also makes a touching video message for her daughter April to see when she grows up. I was very nervous about the scene but it went so well the whole crew applauded.'

Donna manages to record a video of herself for her daughter to watch when she's gone - and Verity says filming the emotional scenes left her worn out. 'I've cried so much I feel I've been through therapy,' she says.

Verity believes the storyline is a fitting finale to her Emmerdale career. 'Hopefully this will show casting directors I mean business. But even if nothing happens after this I'd feel very happy and proud I got to play this great storyline.'

That doesn't mean she isn't sad to go. 'There were tears on my last day,' she admits. 'But it's definitely the right decision.' Verity turns 29 on Friday and has very clear goals. 'By this time next year I'd love to have appeared in a period drama or performed at the National Theatre,' she says.

'At 30, I'll start thinking about having a family. Oh yes, and of course I'd like to visit the Maldives!' 

Holidays – beach or city? I like  New York, where there are shops, shows and cocktails!Meat or fish? Fillet steak every time – I'm a real carnivore.Dogs or cats? I'd like a furry dog like a Bichon Frise. I've got my fingers crossed for my birthday this week!Wine or spirits? Vodka – with lime and lemonade. But my hangovers are getting worse as I get older!Curb Your Enthusiasm or Modern Family? Modern Family – it's the perfect blend of comedy and drama.Dame Judi Dench or Imelda Staunton? Imelda – she's versatile, down-to-earth and a great role model.Tennis or football? I associate tennis with strawberries, sun and Pimm's – so that wins it for me!
