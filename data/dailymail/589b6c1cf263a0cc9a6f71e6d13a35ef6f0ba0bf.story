A Detroit man walked up to a bus stop Saturday asking if people were Muslims and stabbed two that responded no, police say.

Federal authorities are investigating possible hate crime charges after Terrence Lavaron Thomas, 39, knifed one 52-year-old victim five times and stabbed another, 51, in the hand.

'He was not happy that [the victims] indicated that they were not Muslims,' Southfield Police Chief Eric Hawkins told the Washington Post. Thomas, according to Hawkins, 'said that he was a Muslim.'

Investigation: Federal authorities are investigating whether Terrence Lavaron Thomas, 39, committed hate crimes when he stabbed two at a bus stop who told him they were not Muslim

After he 'engaged in conversation' with several people at the bus stop by the Northland Mall, police said he 'asked some of the folks there if they were Muslims.'

The victims 'responded that they were not, and then there was some back-and-forth between the victims and the suspect,' Hawkins said, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Thomas then pulled out a three-inch folding knife 'without provocation' and attacked one of the men, stabbing him once in the face, once in the neck and three times in the back, police said.

He then stabbed another victim in the hand after he attempted to intervene.

Police caught up to Thomas only a few blocks away from the bus shelter shortly after the incident, finding two knives and some marijuana.

'We are getting indications through my officers that the suspect was somewhat incoherent afterward, and so there's a question about his stability,' Hawkins said. 

The two men were treated at Providence Hospital and released with non-life-threatening injuries. 

Southfield police contacted the FBI after the incident and said the agency is investigating possible hate crime charges, according to a press release from the department  Tuesday.

Investigators will also be looking into possible state charges of ethnic intimidation. 

Under Michigan state law 'malicious' physical contact with the intent to 'intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, gender, or national origin' is considered ethnic intimidation.

Thomas is currently charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder, one count of carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent and one count of possession of marijuana.

Magistrate Eman Jajonie-Daman set Thomas’s bond at $1 million and scheduled a preliminary examination for March 4.
