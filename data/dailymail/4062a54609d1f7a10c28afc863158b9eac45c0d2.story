We are still 16 months away from the World Cup and England are serious about putting everything in place to win it on home soil.

However, the selection — or non-selection — of Steffon Armitage for the tour of New Zealand has become the litmus test for exactly how serious and to what lengths they are prepared to go to become world champions.

This is the biggest call of Stuart Lancaster’s time in charge. And it needs to be made now.

Up for the Cup: Steffon Armitage hoists aloft the trophy as Toulon are crowned kings of Europe again

Food for thought: England head coach Stuart Lancaster knows Armitage's qualities

Team and squad selections must never be made on any criteria other than performance and on merit. England players need to know they have been selected on merit and not because some guy playing in Toulon has been declared unavailable by a committee sitting in Twickenham.

I am not saying Steffon would walk into the team but will England be better off adding an in-form European Cup winner who offers something totally different from Robshaw, Wood, Vunipola, Croft and Morgan? Categorically, yes. If we lose Robshaw or Wood, with Croft’s ongoing injuries, an area of strength loses its potency. Armitage changes that.

There can be no compromise, or it can erode confidence. And surely no England coach can be happy with the thought that he is not putting out the strongest side?

Powerhouse: Armitage was named man of the match for his performance on Saturday

Only England and the RFU’s intransigence is making Steffon Armitage unavailable. He is hungry for more international rugby and Toulon are placing no impediment in his way. Every England player will want him in the squad as this group have a chance of a lifetime to do something special. Tough calls need to be made if you are serious about lifting the sport’s biggest prize.

On the form he has shown this season, Armitage must be picked by England. Even in a team of galacticos at Toulon, he is one of the go-to players.

When World Cup winner and Springbok legend Juan Smith, one of his back-row colleagues, says that Armitage is one of the best and most special back-row players he has ever encountered, England need to listen.

Armitage is quick, carries well, is incredible at the tackle and contact area and wins his team four or five turnovers every game. That is gold dust in modern-day Test rugby. He is so good in fact that Toulon have redesigned their pack to accommodate him.

Openside flanker is undoubtedly his ‘gun’ position but Toulon have converted him into probably the only 5ft 9in No 8 in the world and it works. My old adversary Bernard Laporte — the crazy professor — has got this one gloriously right.

England have the players to win the World Cup next year but you have to get those players on the pitch. Great teams are made of great individuals .

The best ever England back row during my time was the famous trio of Neil Back, Lawrence Dallaglio and Richard Hill and I wasn’t too bothered which number shirt they wore.

Neil was a specialist openside but both Richard and Lawrence started Test matches in all three back-row positions during their England careers. I just wanted their combination of pace, skill and physicality on the park and a number of high-quality players such as Joe Worsley, Lewis Moody and Martin Corry often missed out.

Toulon’s Steffon Armitage was man of the match in Saturday’s Heineken Cup final, but he is considerably shorter and lighter than his English back-row rivals Chris Robshaw, Billy Vunipola, Ben Morgan and Tom Wood.

CHRIS ROBSHAWHeight: 6ft 2inWeight: 17st 4lb

BILLY VUNIPOLAHeight: 6ft 2inWeight: 19st 11lb

BEN MORGANHeight: 6ft 3inWeight: 18st 3lb

TOM WOODHeight: 6ft 5inWeight: 17st 2lb

It will be scary next autumn for opponents to confront a back row of Tom Croft at No 8, Armitage at openside and Chris Robshaw at blindside flanker. I am a big Chris Robshaw fan, he’s become a fine captain and has done well at openside but to my eyes he could be an absolutely world-class blindside flanker in the same mould as Richard Hill.

Robshaw would have to fight off Tom Wood, another terrific blindside, for the starting spot but that is what elite Test rugby is about: incredible competition for places and harsh selection decisions. Who would have ever thought Brian O’Driscoll could ever be dropped by the Lions last summer?

We have to rid ourselves of this prejudice against selecting England players abroad. It’s inherently flawed and I totally support the strong words of Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal after Saturday’s final when he said it was ‘stupid’ and ‘misplaced protectionism’. Mourad makes the point that it doesn’t make them any less English — in fact it enhances their desire to represent their country.

Captain fantastic: Chris Robshaw (right) has grown in stature under Stuart Lancaster

Jonny Wilkinson went for lifestyle 
reasons and a last great challenge to stimulate the final seasons of his
 career. And what a success he made of it. Steffon Armitage simply 
wanted to improve his game with a side that placed emphasis on his 
skills.

His brother Delon — another huge talent who I would seriously consider for any England squad picked purely on merit — also felt the south of France was the environment where his game could flourish.

These were huge decisions the Armitage brothers made, uprooting family and tearing themselves away from the familiarity of Premiership rugby to test themselves in a hugely competitive league and to join a club where a First XV start had to be earned every week.

There were no guarantees yet here they are with two Heineken Cup winner’s medals apiece. A coach looking on should be very impressed by the independence of mind and spirit, rather than be suspicious.

Knocking on the door: Armitage's performances mean he surely cannot be ignored any longer
