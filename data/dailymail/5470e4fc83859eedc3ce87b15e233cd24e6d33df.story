The problem with wearable technology is that nobody wants to wear it.

This is the sentiment surrounding some recent releases of chunky smart watches, unflattering glasses and outrageous jewellery.

But one company has decided to shake up the technology and fashion worlds by bringing its wearable technology designs to the catwalk.

London-based CuteCircuit has unveiled a new collection of wearable technology outfits that it claims doesn't compromise on fashion

Earlier this month, Francesca Rosella of London-based CuteCircuit sent models strutting down the runway at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.

Some of the models had iPhones in their hand, giving them the ability to customise their outfits by making them change colour, glow in the dark and play video.

According to NBC News, before the show, one of the models didn’t even realise there was something special about her skirt.

Batteries are disguised as buttons or clasps meaning that the designs can be created with traditional fabrics

The outfits can change colour, light up or shimmer using an iPhone app that will be available for download in the near future

Cute Circuit already has celebrity clientele 
including  Nicole Scherzinger who famously wore its Twitter dress with 
live updates streaming in 2012.

The
 dress was constructed from eight metres of French silk chiffon, laden 
with over 500 Swarovski crystals and over 2,000 LED lights that lit up 
with messages from fans.

Scherzinger wasn't the first to wear such advanced fashions. Singer Imogen Heap performed at the 2010 Grammy Awards in a dress displaying her Twitter feed, which she said was envisioned as a way to let fans 'accompany me on the red carpet.'

What Ms Rosella had hidden was a series of micro-LED lights using conductive nylon ribbon removing the need for wires.

The batteries, meanwhile, were disguised as buttons or clasps allowing the clothing to be designed and made with existing fabrics.

‘Everything in our life is completely digital,’ Ms Rosella, said in an interview with NBC News.

‘So why does fashion seem like it’s stuck in the Middle Ages? The most advanced technology on most designs are Velcro and zippers.’

The outfits are connected to a smartphone on a free app via Bluetooth. From there, the user has control of their garment and can alter the colour or pattern.

The app, which will be available on the Apple Store in the near future, allows you to control their entire 'smart' wardrobe.

‘Everything in our life is completely digital,’ the designer Francesca Rosella, said in an interview. ‘So why does fashion seem like it’s stuck in the Middle Ages?'

‘Integrating fashion and technology is not an easy thing to do and you’ll still find people that think we send a garment out with a gigantic car battery and thick electric wires inside,’ the company wrote on their website.

The group already has celebrity clientele including  Nicole Scherzinger who famously wore its Twitter dress with live updates streaming in 2012.
