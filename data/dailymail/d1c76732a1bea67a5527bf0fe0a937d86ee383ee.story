A miracle baby was yesterday born to an expectant mother as Superstorm Sandy ravaged the East Coast, causing power outages, mass destruction and multiple deaths.

But for Julie Alemany, 34, the storm brought life, in the form of baby Micah.

The new mother went into labour at around 6pm on Monday, just as New Yorkers prepared for Sandy’s arrival onto land.

Parents: Ms Alemany and her husband Doran Markus had to flee the West Village apartment they were staying in ahead of this Saturday's due date

As people around the state battened down the hatchets Ms Alemany and her husband Doran Markus had to flee the West Village apartment they were staying in ahead of this Saturday’s due date.

But things took a turn for the even worse, when New York University Hospital lost power at around 9pm, plunging its eighth floor maternity ward into darkness.

'Suddenly, I hear a lot of commotion outside and the word “Fire!”' Ms Alemany told The Daily News. ‘There was smoke at the end of the corridor, everyone was running.’

The fire turned out to be a false alarm but Ms Alemany was told she would need to evacuate anyway, despite the painful contractions that were ripping through her body.

‘I said “I can’t run!”’ she said, describing how she begged for pain relief until she was given a low-dose epidural by the light of a cell phone held by her husband.

Two
hundred and fifteen patients were evacuated from the now pitch-black 
hospital, ten of them expectant mothers, two, including Ms Alemany, in 
active labour.

She was bundled into a waiting ambulance whose driver had been drafted in from California to help with storm relief and had no idea how to get to the next hospital.

A nurse gave directions and they set off into the storm. They were diverted several times while tree branches crashed down on the roof.

They eventually pulled into Mount Sinai Hospital at midnight and baby Micah came into the world at 12.48am, weighing 7lbs 15oz.

‘I never thought his birth would be anything like this,’ she said, beaming. ‘It was the most intense experience of my life.’

All of the evacuated patients arrived safely at other locations around the state, with doctors and nurses being hailed as heroes by President Obama during the storm.

‘We drill and prepare for these emergencies, and when it came, it paid off,’ said Dr. Michael Bordman, chief of obstetrics at Mount Sinai said. ‘We were ready.’
