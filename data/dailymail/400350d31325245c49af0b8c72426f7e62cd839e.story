Jailed: Kevin Sherwood has been sentenced to 12 months in prison for defrauding two elderly couples

A fraudulent roofer has joined his two sons on a list of rogue traders after he was found guilty of conning £37,000 out of two elderly couples.

Kevin Sherwood was sentenced to 12 months in prison and given an ASBO stopping him from taking advantage of pensioners.

His sons, Danny and Kevin Jr, previously escaped jail despite being found guilty of ripping off elderly homeowners by charging hundreds of pounds for work they had offered to carry out for a token sum.

Sherwood, 53, was hired by one couple to fix the fascias and soffits at their home, but managed to convince them the entire roof needed replacing.

Edward Longcroft, 89, and his 81-year-old wife Barbara handed Sherwood £25,000 in savings which they had saved in case they ever needed to go into care.

The workman went on to dupe a second couple out of £12,000 for unnecessary repairs to their roof of their bungalow home.

He even drove his 85-year-old victim Alan Read to the bank five times to withdraw the money to pay for the job.

The police were informed when Mr Read's son-in-law returned home from holiday to find him on the verge of a nervous breakdown over the scam.

Sherwood, from Bournemouth, was found guilty of defrauding Mr Read and partner Margaret Williamson, 82.

He was jailed for 12 months by a judge at Bournemouth Crown Court, who slammed him for taking advantage of an elderly couple.

He also pleaded guilty to four charges brought by his local trading standards department for breaching building regulations during his work on the Longcrofts' home.

Mr Read said afterwards: 'I feel such a fool and an idiot really. I got sucked in, it was the biggest mistake of my life.'

Mrs Williamson, a retired schoolteacher, added: 'I was disgusted that we had been taken in, it was awful.'

Mrs Longcroft said: 'One of us will probably have to go into care and the money we spent should have been used for that.

'We get no compensation for what he has done to us and this is no deterrent to other cowboy builders out there.'

Sherwood committed his crimes in September 2011 - five months after his son Kevin Jr tried to trick a vulnerable pensioner out of thousands of pounds after convincing him his garage roof was dangerous.

He turned up at his victim's house one morning and offered to fix some tiles which had mysteriously fallen off in return for £50.

Eventually, he charged the elderly man £3,700 for the straightforward work.

He was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service.

Later that year, his brother Danny, 29, avoided prison over a similar con after pleading guilty to carrying out work that was unnecessary.

He had told an 86-year-old woman he could fix a tile on her roof for a 'fiver'.

But he later claimed the work was far more extensive than he thought, and took £80 in cash from her as well as a cheque for £700.

In addition to being jailed, Sherwood Sr was given a five-year ASBO, requiring him to notify trading standards before entering into a contract with anybody aged over 75.

Detective Constable Martin Farrington, of Dorset Police, said: 'Kevin Sherwood took advantage of a vulnerable elderly victim.

'I hope that this sentence sends a clear message that such actions will not be tolerated.'Andy Sherriff, trading standards manager at Bournemouth council, said: 'Mr Sherwood and his family are well known to us and his sons have been dealt with before.'
