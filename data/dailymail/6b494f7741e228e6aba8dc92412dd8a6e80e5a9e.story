This 12-year-old's exceptional musical ability didn't go unnoticed by Southwest Airlines staff.

Mia Kylie, from Marrero, Louisiana, spread some holiday cheer to passengers during a recent flight from New Orleans to Dallas.

Travellers were treated to an impromptu performance when a flight attendant asked the pre-teen to serenade the plane with her stunning version of Frank Sinatra's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.

Mia, who has sung at Walt Disney World and Six Flags Over Texas, was on her way to the theme park in Arlington, just outside of Dallas, when the impromptu performance took place.

Mia and her mum, Meiko Ditta, had just boarded Southwest Flight 1768 over the weekend 'when she was asked by a wonderful, friendly stewardess to sing a holiday song over the intercom,' her father, Jimmie Ditta, told NOLA.com. 

'The performance brought on an encore and she sang a second song in the air prior to landing.'

After finishing her first song, Mia performed an encore of Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree for travellers

Mia happily obliged and performed Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree at several thousand feet.

'As they were leaving the plane, the captain asked if she would sing a second encore at the Southwest Airlines Terminal, and Mia didn't disappoint,' her father added.

Once on the ground, the aspiring star performed Where Are You Christmas? from the 2000 remake of How The Grinch Stole Christmas.

'She performed in front of several hundred passengers who watched and applauded,' he said.
