Lululemon is hoping to boost sales among men with a new genital-friendly range of pants.

Lululemon Athletica Inc told Bloomberg on Thursday that its ABC pants - referring to their 'anti-ball crushing' design - have given the company a 16 per cent  sales hike in the men's sector of the business last quarter. 

The Canada-based company's website describes the pants as 'ABC (anti-ball crushing) engineering gives you and the family jewels room to breathe'.

Lululemon Athletica were hoping their men's ABC pants - referring to their 'anti-ball crushing' design - would boost sales

The men's pants were described by the company as 'giving you and the family jewels room to breathe'

The site goes on: 'A wide paneled gusset and four-way stretch Warpstreme fabric make these pants commute, travel and sweat ready.'

The Vancouver-based company made its mark on the sports retail market with yoga clothing 

Consumers were divided over the ABCs. 

One man wrote: 'Despite the waist, the fabric is amazing however the legs were so tight and the fabric so thin. If I wore these out everyone would know what underwear I have on by being able to see the lines, that's how tight the thighs are.'

But a happy customer posted: 'I love these pants. I wear them as casual, for work (I am a financial advisor) and I wore them to yoga once just to see how flexible they are and they were excellent.

'They are great as travel pants, very comfortable on the plane or driving the car.'

Another added: 'Got the grey initially and was pretty satisfied. I would say there was reduced ball crushing, but they are still pretty snug in the thighs and crotch.' 

The company, which is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, offers a range of athletic wear for men along with smarter clothing. 

There are 'sweat, post-sweat and no sweat categories'.

The athletic brand, set up by Dennis 'Chip' Wilson in Vancouver in 1998, opened its first men's store in the Soho neighborhood of Manhattan on Black Friday last year.  

And the company is taking advantage of a boost in sales from men's attire and expanding the ranges in stores.  

According to the company's 2013 annual report, Lululemon had 211 locations.   

However despite the launch of the ABC pants, shares in Lululemon slumped almost 6 per cent on Thursday.

Even though the company raised its expectations for 2015, Wall Street has been looking for even more and its first-quarter outlook disappointed as well.

Lululemon earned $110.9 million, or 78 cents per share, for the period ended February 1. That compares with $109.7 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales at stores open for at least a year climbed 5 per cent in the quarter, but declined 1 per cent for the year.

For the year, the Canadian company reported an adjusted profit of $1.89 per share on revenue of $1.8 billion. 

Shares of Lululemon fell $3.38 to $57.58 before the market had opened.

Chip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon Athletica Inc., stepped down from the company board last month. 

He had resigned as chairman last year after controversy about comments he made about customers' body types.

In March 2013, the retailer had to issue a massive recall of its black yoga pants after women discovered they were transparent. 

The recall, of around 17 per cent of pants sold, had a financial impact on the company.
