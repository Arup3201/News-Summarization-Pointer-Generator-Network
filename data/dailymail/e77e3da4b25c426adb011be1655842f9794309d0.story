A British secret agent was at the centre of a plot to destabilise the USSR by handing out copies of Boris Pasternak's book Doctor Zhivago to ordinary Soviet citizens, it has been revealed.

The writer's 1957 classic work was strictly banned in the Soviet Union because Communist censors believed it challenged the official version of events in the Russian revolution.

The CIA saw the book as the perfect propaganda weapon against its enemy during the tensest years of the Cold War.

It has now emerged that the US intelligence agency got a copy of the work due to a British secret agent, who photographed the text, which was then passed on to Washington by MI6.

A British secret agent got hold of a manuscript of Boris Pasternak's book Doctor Zhivago ahead of a CIA plot to use the classic work to undermine the Soviet Union's Communist regime

The British link to the plot only emerged this week, in newly classified CIA documents that state an unnamed MI6 agent got hold of the original text.

How the spy found the manuscript is unclear, as Russian writer Pasternak is only thought to have given it to his Italian publisher and two Oxford dons, one of which was the famous philosopher Isaiah Berlin.

But a CIA memo states that in January 1958, British intelligence handed over two microfilms containing negatives of the original 433-page manuscript.

The memo, published in Guardian today, states that MI6 were 'in favour of exploiting Pasternak's book and have offered to provide whatever assistance they can'.

What the CIA did next is the subject of a new book, The Zhivago Affair: The Kremlin, the CIA and the Battle over a Forbidden Book by Peter Finn and Petra Couvee, which is published on July 3.

The new book reveals that the Americans used the 
British idea and had copies of the Russian text printed in Holland 
before giving them to visiting Russians at Vatican's pavilion of the 
1958 World's Fair in Brussels.

The Americans hoped the secret copies would circulate behind the Iron Curtain and undermineNikita Khrushchev's Communist regime in the years before the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Another CIA memo from the time states: 'We have the opportunity to make Soviet citizens wonder what is wrong with their government, when a fine literary work by the man acknowledged to be the greatest living Russian writer is not even available in his own country in his own language for his own people to read.'

The novel follows the life of Yuri Zhivago, a physician and poet, as he falls in love with two women throughout decades of revolution, war and Communist oppression in Russia.

The CIA's Soviet Russia Division chief said in another declassified memo: 'Pasternak's humanistic message - that every person is entitled to a private life and deserves respect as a human being, irrespective of the extent of his political loyalty or contribution to the state - poses a fundamental challenge to the Soviet ethic of sacrifice of the individual to the Communist system.'

Pasternak won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1958, but was not allowed to travel to Sweden to claim the award.

He spent the rest of his life in USSR and died at the age of 70 in 1960.

The 1965 film adaptation of the novel starring Julie Christie and Omar Sharif went on to win five Academy Awards, a nomination for best picture and remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time.

The book's author went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature and the story was made into a hugely successful film starring Omar Sharif as Yuri Zhivago and Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya
