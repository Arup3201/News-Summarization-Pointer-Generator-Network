A drugs mule has been busted trying to smuggle almost two kilos of cocaine into Spain in her breasts.

Cruel traffickers forced the 28-year-old Panamanian woman to undergo surgery where several bags of the Class A drug were inserted beneath her skin - much like a breast implant.

She was stopped earlier this month at Barcelona's El Prat airport, following a flight on Colombia's Avianca airline, after police thought she was 'acting funny'.

During a search, they found a blood soaked bandage covering her chest - which she admitted resulted from the operation to introduce the packets of drugs into her body.

She was rushed to a medical centre in the city, where doctors removed 1.8 kilos of cocaine  - worth about £240,000- in a number of sealed bags.

A police source told the Vozpópuli news website that her arrest most likely saved her life, as she may not have survived much longer with such quantities of the substance in her body.

He said: 'She was in a very bad state when she arrived. She said she was not in any pain but the wounds looked very bad.'

It was, he added, the first time officers had ever seen drugs hidden inside the breasts of a woman.

It is the second time in recent years that a woman has been caught smuggling in such a way.

in 2011, a model was arrested by Italian police trying to smuggle more than £250,000 of cocaine into the country inside breast and buttock implants.

The 33-year-old woman, identified only by the initials MFM, was held by officers as she tried to distract them with her plunging neckline and tight-fitting outfit at Rome's Fiumicino airport.

But her plan backfired as they were so captivated by her looks they pulled her over for questioning and discovered the drugs when she failed to explain why she had been to South America.

The woman had flown to Rome from Sao Paolo in Brazil and a search by female officers revealed the fake breast and buttock implants she was wearing had also been used to hide 5.5lbs of cocaine.
