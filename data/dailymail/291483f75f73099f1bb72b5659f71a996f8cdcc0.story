Tougher restrictions on ammunition are needed to stop British-based jihadists carrying out Paris-style gun attacks, a former security minister has said.

Lord West said the UK’s tough anti-gun laws were a crucial tool in the fight against terror - but demanded further action to tighten restrictions on ammunition.

The Labour peer also hit out at the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for blocking new powers for the security services and urged ministers to increase anti-terror funding.

Former security minister Admiral Lord West said new powers were needed to tackle Islamist fanatics

Lord West's intervention comes amid warnings from security chiefs that up to 150 jihadists in the UK could carry out gun attacks similar to the Paris atrocities, the Sunday Times reported this morning.

Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning Lord West said the government’s Communications Data Bill, dubbed a ‘snoopers’ charter’ by opponents, was needed to track terrorist suspects.

The bill allows the security services to monitor who people are emailing and what they are looking at online.

Lord West said: ‘I think that needs to go through, and I was very irked that it was removed, in fact it was removed by the Deputy Prime Minister, when it had all been agreed across all parties.’

He added that the security services ‘need more money’ to monitor suspected terrorists amid claims that up to 150 fanatics have returned from the war in Syria intent on carrying out attacks at home.

The Labour peer’s warning comes after security chiefs warned last week that Britain was being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists.

MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK.

Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months.

Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car.

Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect.

At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said.

Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria – about 300 of who are now back home. 

Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists.

Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain.

He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain.

But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later.

He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities.

In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.'

Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks.

In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed.

He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness.

'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year.

'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq.

'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in.

'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.'

The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need

Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK.

'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf.

'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.'

'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely.

'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.'

Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics.

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks.

He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen.

'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks.

'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.'
