An 'over-eager' father has ruined a primary school disco after charging onto the dance floor to break up a fight between two children - and then calling the police to report an assault. 

The 'angry and intimidating' dad forced the event at St Andrew's and St Mark's Church of England Junior school to be cancelled mid-way through on March 19.

He 'pulled the children apart' and then started 'shouting and swearing' before calling 999 to say the children at the Surrey school 'assaulted' each other.

'Intimidating': The parent who called the police to report a scuffle at a primary school disco 'shouted and swore' in front of the children

Children at the 280-pupil school which has been rated 'outstanding' were escorted out of the disco while police spoke to the 'upset parent', but no action was ultimately taken.

The school's parent-teacher association (PTA) wrote a letter to parents saying: 'A parent of one of the children was on site when the incident happened and took it upon themselves to resolve the situation despite the PTA trying to step in.

'This was inappropriate behaviour on behalf of the parent and it came across as angry and intimidating.

'The parent also took it upon themselves to call the police who did attend the school. Unfortunately the children in the hall witnessed this behaviour.'

A mother who asked not to be identified, said: 'I heard about this from my son who said this guy just flew onto the dance floor and pulled these two children apart.

'He was shouting and screaming about one hitting the other and then he pulled out his phone and called the police and reported one of the children for assault. He ruined it for everyone.'

Angry: The school wrote a letter to parents following the incidents in which described the parent who called the police's behaviour as 'inappropriate'

While a spokesman for Kingston Council said: 'We take these matters extremely seriously, and the school has written to all the parents assuring them that the disco was constantly supervised.

'It is such a shame that a lovely event, usually enjoyed by all, was marred by the actions of one parent.

'We understand that this incident will have been very stressful for the children who witnessed it and the school will support them in any way needed.'

A spokesman for the school declined to comment.
