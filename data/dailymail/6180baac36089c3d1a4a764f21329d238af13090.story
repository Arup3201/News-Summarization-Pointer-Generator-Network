Barcelona residents will no longer be allowed to walk their dogs without a lead under new by-laws passed

Residents of Barcelona will no longer be allowed to walk their dogs without leads after a number of by-laws designed to help people and animals 'coexist' were passed.

People in the Catalonian capital are also now prohibited from leaving their cats indoors for too long and will face fines for feeding pigeons.  Meanwhile, those caught feeding stray cats will face fines of €750 (£618).

Owners, who do not keep their dogs on leashes or immediately pick up their pet's mess, will be charged up to €1,500 (£1,236).

According to the Telegraph, the new by-laws – passed on Monday – are to improve ‘co-existence between residents and animals’.

Previously, people were allowed to let dogs off their leashes if they behaved.

Now, they will only be allowed to walk free in designated areas, which - according to the paper - residents feel are too few and far between.

The paper reports senior city councillor Jordi Marti as saying that the laws are being imposed because of an ‘uncivilised’ minority.

On the decision to pass the by-laws, El Pais reports him as saying: 'This is the 21st century, not the 19th century.'

New by-laws also state that people may not leave their animals home alone for certain times – more than 12 hours for dogs, and three days for cats.

Barcelona residents are now prohibited from keeping monkeys and horses as pets in the city. 

They are also prohibited from breeding animals for sale.

Under the by-laws, dogs will now be allowed on to the city’s metro system.

New animal owners, meanwhile, will only be able to buy or adopt a pet when they have signed a document saying they have not abused an animal.

They will be charged with a crime if they are found to have lied.

According to El Pais, there are an estimated 120,000 dogs, but only 30,000 of these are registered.
