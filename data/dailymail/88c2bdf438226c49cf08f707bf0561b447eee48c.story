Michael Gove, who himself was adopted, wants to make the process easier for would-be parents

The law is to be changed to stop councils blocking mixed-race adoptions as part of radical reforms to ensure children are removed from unfit parents more quickly.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was ‘horrifying’ evidence that youngsters were being left in dangerous homes for too long.

Mr Gove, who was adopted at four months, said he wants many more children to be adopted before the age of one. He said local councils were blocking potential adoptions purely because would-be parents were not the same race as the child.

Mr Gove revealed yesterday that David Cameron has agreed to change the law to prevent such discrimination and to speed up the process.

Of 3,600 children in care under the age of one, only 60 were adopted last year. Black children were three times less likely to find new parents than white ones.

Mr Gove said he was deeply angered that falling numbers of adoptions – a 17 per cent decline in the last decade – meant a ‘cruel rationing of human love for those most in need’.

The Education Secretary said couples were being turned down for trivial reasons, including one case in which a couple who had already adopted five children successfully could not take on another until they bought an electric kettle with a shorter lead. Other couples are being asked questions such as whether they have non-slip mats in the shower, and asked to fill out nine pages of forms about the potential risks posed by their pets.

Mr Gove will publish an adoption plan next month to sweep away bureaucratic hurdles and make the process of finding a permanent home for children in care in England swifter, simpler and more flexible.

Mr Gove revealed how one couple was banned from adopting because their kettle flex was too long, in violation of safety rules

Speaking in London, he said that despite guidelines issued a year ago, local councils are still refusing to approve interracial adoptions. Mr Gove said: ‘There are a number of local authorities which have put their belief in creating a perfect match ahead of the interests of children, a number of local authorities on whose websites you can see clearly policies that show they want to have ethnicity taken into account ahead of other factors that are more important in the interests of the child. We will be legislating.’

He conceded that few aspects of the adoption process are as politically sensitive as that of ethnicity and said that in an ideal world, an ethnic match between adopters and a child was a bonus.

‘But the reality is that a black child is three times less likely to be adopted from care than a white child,’ he added.

‘If there is a loving family, ready and able to adopt a child, issues of ethnicity must not stand in the way.’

Mr Gove said he wanted to ‘radically’ increase the number of adoptive parents, suggesting parents with their own children, heterosexual and homosexual couples unable to have children of their own, and single individuals, both men and women, should come forward.

He said it was clear that the earlier a child is adopted, the greater the chances of success.

Only 2 or 3 per cent of arrangements break down when a child joins new parents before the age of one, he added.

Mr Gove said it was better to take a child into care than allow it to be abused, but there was ‘horrifying’ evidence that social workers and other officials are often reluctant to remove a child from unfit parents.

He highlighted research which found cases of a baby whose parents ‘so persistently forgot to feed her that she ceased to cry’, a two-year-old left to forage in the waste bin for food and a three-year-old ‘who could accurately demonstrate how heroin is prepared’.

‘All these children remained with their birth parents for many months without being taken into care,’ said Mr Gove. ‘Who knows how much damage they suffered, and how many children like them are suffering still?

‘This cannot be allowed to continue. The welfare of a neglected or abused child is more important than the rights of their parents, more important than the schedules of the courts, more important than ticking boxes on forms and much more important than the old saw that blood is thicker than water.’
