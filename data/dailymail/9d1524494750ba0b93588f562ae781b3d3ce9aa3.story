Cell phone use on planes has taken another step towards becoming a reality.

The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to consider allowing fliers to use phones during flights.

The vote came despite overwhelming public opinion being against in-flight phone calls and three members of Congress and the Department of Transportation taking steps to block them.

Can you hear me now?: Talking during flights may become a reality

Should in-flight cell phone calls be allowed?

The divergent agendas of the two agencies are coming to a head as technology allowing in-flight calls is set to be deployed across the United States.

Cell phone calls have not been allowed during flights for what both the government and airlines have claimed are technical reasons, but newer solutions being made available render that explanation obsolete.

There have been rumblings in both directions over whether voice calls should be allowed during flights, but the FCC voted 3-2 in favour of at least considering lifting the ban.

Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx sees things differently and told CNN he is concerned about how fair it is to fliers to have to sit through flights filled with people barking into their cell phones.

‘Over the past few weeks, we have heard of concerns raised by airlines, travelers, flight attendants, members of Congress and others who are all troubled over the idea of passengers talking on cell phones in flight,’ he told the network in a statement.

‘I am concerned about this possibility as well,’ he added.

Against the idea: An overwhelming majority of Americans want flight to remain without voice calls, but they are currently allowed while the plane is on the ground

The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates air travel, is under the DOT umbrella. The regulator is not only concerned with travel safety, but also consumer rights.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is spearheading the effort to study the feasibility of in flight calls.

‘I'm the last person in the world who wants to listen to someone talking to me while I fly across the country,’ he told a congressional panel Thursday, ‘but we are the technical agency, and we will make the rules for the way the new technology works.’

Simply allowing the technology to be used, he further argued, does not mean it will be mandated.

‘The proposal would not require airlines to either install such equipment, or to offer mobile wireless services aboard their aircraft,’ Mr Wheeler testified.

‘Airlines would be free, within the confines of the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Department of Transportation (DOT), to make their own decisions,’ the chairman continued.

FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who voted in favor of the idea, explained that silence may in the future come at a cost.

‘If we move beyond what we do here today and actually update our rules to allow voice calls on planes we can see a future where our quiet time is monetized and seating in the silent section comes at a premium.’

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN), as well as House Rep. Bill Shuster, (R-PA) introduced bills to permanently block calls while in the air.

A recent poll revealed how unenthused people are at the idea of voice calls during flights.

Only 30 per cent of those polled were in favour of lifting the ban, according to researchers from Quinnipiac University. Even more surprisingly, only 39 per cent of those aged 18 to 29 wanted voice calls during flights.

It is not clear if voice calls will be allowed during flights, but texting on planes - which most people are in favor of allowing - should be available early next year.
