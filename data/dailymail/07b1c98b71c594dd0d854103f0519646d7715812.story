A heart-rending letter a soldier wrote to his sweetheart in the event of his death revealing how nerves had stopped him proposing marriage has been uncovered after 98 years.

Captain Harry Cromie wrote the dreaded 'if you're reading this...' note to Vera Vereker on the eve of going into battle at the Somme in the First World War in October 1916.

He was killed in action  and fours days later 18-year-old Vera received his last, devastating letter in the post.

In the poignant note, Capt Cromie, who was 20 when he died, told Vera he hadn't been able to pluck up the courage to ask her to marry him the last time they saw one another.

Heartbreaking: Captain Harry Cromie wrote the letter no one should ever receive to Vera Vereker on the eve of going into battle at the Somme in the First World War in October 1916. He did not live to see her again

Despite going on to find love with another man and marry and have children, Vera kept the two page letter for the rest of her life, along with a locket containing photos of her and Harry

It reads: 'By this you will know that I have been killed.

'I meant to ask you to be engaged to me but when I was on leave I was too frightened to say anything - I loved you very, very much and would have done anything for you.'

Harry signed off: 'Ever your own loving boy.'

Despite going on to find love with another man and marry and have children, Vera kept the two page letter for the rest of her life, along with a locket containing photos of her and Harry.

She gave her granddaughter Kate Vereka-Durston the locket on her deathbed in 1988. Her other granddaughter, Mary Kendall, discovered the letter in a case of her grandmother's belongings.

But it has only been since the creation of online genealogy websites that Mrs Kendall, 70, has been able to find out more information about Capt Cromie and his romance with her grandmother.

The touching account was revealed for the first time on BBC1's Antiques Roadshow after Mrs Kendall, from Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, took the items to one of the programme's events.

She said: 'I had a suitcase of old memorabilia of my grandmothers' after she died and this letter was with all these other mundane things.

Capt Cromie was born in October 1896 and was the younger son of Joan and Captain Charles Cromie, who was the British vice-consul to Morocco 

'I just read it once and thought about how sad it was and then put it to one side and forgot about it.

'Years later I started doing some family research and remembered the letter and tried to find out who 'Harry' in the letter was.'

Mrs Kendall dug out an old photo album that belonged to her grandmother and found black and white snaps of a 'Harry' visiting her parents' house in Nettlestone on the Isle of Wight in the summer of 1916.

Along with the photo in the locket, she was able to compare them with a photograph from Capt Harry Cromie's military records.

Mrs Kendall said: 'It appears that his mother and my grandmother's parents were good friends. Harry was in the Hampshire Regiment which was based on the Isle of Wight before the Somme so he must have spent time with her on leave.

'It is clear from the letter and the locket that they were very much in love.

'The letter stabs you in the heart and makes you think of what might have been. If he had survived the war I wouldn't be here now.'

Capt Cromie was born in October 1896 and was the younger son of Joan and Captain Charles Cromie, who was the British vice-consul to Morocco.

The family lived in Ringwood, Hampshire, and Capt Cromie was a schoolteacher before he joined the Hampshire Regiment in February 1915.

In June 1915, his elder brother, Lieutenant Maurice Cromie of the Hampshire Regiment, was killed at Gallipoli.

Capt Cromie's battalion was sent to the Somme in October 1916 and on the 23rd the men attacked the German lines at Lesboeufs, coming under heavy machine gun and rifle fire.

He was killed and, just like his older brother, his body was never recovered. Their names were added the the war memorials at Theipval and Helles respectively.

Vera's mother died in 1915 and her father passed away the following year.

Mrs Kendall said: 'One can only imagine what she must have gone through at that time.'

Vera married RAF officer Albert Durston in 1918 and they had three children. She divorced and remarried Royal Naval commander Geoffrey Dalley in 1948.

At the time of her death aged 91 in 1988 she was lived in Motcombe, Dorset.
