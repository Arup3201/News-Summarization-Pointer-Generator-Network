It might be wanted for large-scale human atrocities - but the North Korean dictatorship has shown it still cares about health and happiness. 

The country's leaders took time out of their busy schedule to send a thoughtful congratulatory letter to the Queen on her official birthday.

The wishes were sent by the country's second most powerful man Kim Yong-nam, the president of the Presidium of the Supreme Assembly of North Korea, on June 14.

The official Korean Central News Agency reported that the message 'wished the queen good health and happiness'.

The letter also reportedly wished 'well-being and prosperity' to the British people.

According to the KCNA, the British embassy in Pyongyang even marked the occasion with a reception which was attended by the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade.

According to experts, the move shows North Korea is looking for 'new friends', particularly as China moves closer to forging an alliance with South Korea.

Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told The Telegraph: 'North Korea is looking for new friends,
 while they have also sent officials to London to make money on the 
stock market and seek development aid.

'But there is also real concern in the leadership there that the regime could collapse without China's support, so they are looking for a country that might provide them with political asylum. It is possible that they think Britain might provide that.'

China, North Korea's most significant ally, has attempted to bring Kim Jong-un's regime to heel, over growing anger at the country's refusal to stop the development of nuclear warheads.

In January, Beijing stopped sending important oil over the border.

On June 5, KCNA reported that Kim Jong-un sent a message to Bashar Al-Assad, congratulating the Syrian president on his re-election.

The self-promoting photos of the dictator were released by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party

Meanwhile, Kim Jong-Un was spotted out and about on a submarine in his latest show of self-promotion.

The images, released by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, show the North Korean leader leading a drill on the vessel, while also teaching the captain of the North Korean Navy Unit 167 how to navigate.

The posed-up shots also show the leader riding on top of the submarine as it remained above water and being shown around inside.
