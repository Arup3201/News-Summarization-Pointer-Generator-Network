A surgeon has rendered a patient infertile by giving him a vasectomy when he went into hospital for a minor operation.

The patient was the victim of what hospital chiefs have called a 'never event' - a medical mistake that should never happen.

The man, who had the original procedure at Broadgreen Hospital in Liverpool earlier this year, has been told that an operation to reverse the vasectomy was unsuccessful. He could now be entitled to more than £100,000 in compensation.

It is understood that the surgeon who performed the surgery has since been fired, according a report.

The urology department at Broadgreen Hospital, part of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, has admitted the 
error was just one of five botched operations - and two 'never events' - in the last 12 months.

Another mistake involved a medical swab being left inside a patient during an operation.

The Royal Liverpool Hospital 'apologised
 unreservedly' to the man when details of the mistake, which they termed
 'wrong site surgery', emerged earlier this year.

The vasectomy - and the failed reversal - means that the patient will not be able to conceive naturally.

Ian Cohen, clinical negligence lawyer at 
Slater & Gordon, said the vasectomy patient could be eligible for more than 
£100,000 in compensation, but it would depend on how old he is and 
whether or not he has been left infertile.

Mr
 Cohen said: 'This is a truly shocking and worrying case. From what we know there has 
been a catastrophic breakdown in procedure, as simple checks designed to
 ensure the correct operation is carried out on the right patient seem 
to have failed.

'If a 25-year-old who wants a family is told he won’t be able to father children, it will be devastating.'

Hospital bosses say the blunders have been reported to NHS chiefs and 
that investigations are under way to establish how they happened.

Dr Peter Williams, medical director at Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen 
University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Our urology department is the 
biggest in Cheshire and Merseyside, caring for over 4,000 patients a 
year.

'The vast majority of feedback from these patients is 
overwhelmingly positive.

'We have excellent, highly regarded clinical 
teams who treat the most difficult urological cases, many of which are 
referred to us by other hospitals for our expertise and leading edge surgical techniques.

'In
 the last 12 months, three serious incidents and two never events 
occurred in our urology department and these were reported to the 
appropriate bodies.

'We are still in the process of investigating some of these
 incidents, including looking at how to improve the processes and 
systems in place and are taking appropriate action.

'We cannot comment on
 the outcomes of these investigations at this stage.

'Patient safety 
is always our priority and we use the lessons learnt from any incident 
to continually improve our standard of care.'
