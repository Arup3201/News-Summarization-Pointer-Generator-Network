Businessman Dewani, 35, took an overdose of tranquillisers while depressed in the weeks following Anni’s death

Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani attempted suicide after his wife Anni was killed during a hijacking in Cape Town four years ago, a psychiatric report has revealed.

Businessman Dewani, 35, took an overdose of tranquillisers while depressed in the weeks following Anni’s death, according to a medical panel reporting to the Western Cape High Court on Friday.

The panel also said that Dewani had been experiencing nightmares and flashbacks from the night his wife died.

Four psychiatrists and a clinical psychologist have been assessing him at the city’s Valkenberg Hospital since his extradition in April on a charge of murder. 

They have concluded that he is fit to stand trial.

Dewani is accused of hiring hitmen to stage the hijacking of their taxi as he and Anni were driven through a poor township late at night during their honeymoon in 2010.

Three men have already been convicted of hijacking, murder and robbery charges in connection with Anni’s death and are serving prison sentences.

The report handed to the court on Friday described how Dewani, from Bristol, ‘took to his bed’ for a week after his wife’s funeral, suffering flashbacks and nightmares.

He refused to attend a psychiatric facility and was instead being managed at home where he was treated for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. 

Dewani is said to be ‘engaging well’ and is articulate and often affable at Valkenberg Hospital.

His trial will start on October 6 and is expected to run until December 12.
