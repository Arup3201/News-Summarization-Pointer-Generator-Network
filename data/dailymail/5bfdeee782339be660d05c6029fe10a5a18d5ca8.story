Boris Johnson yesterday laughed off the BBC interview that branded him ‘a nasty piece of work’, saying his inquisitor ‘did a splendid job’.

The London Mayor praised Eddie Mair for the grilling he gave him, and how he focussed on whether Mr Johnson had lied about an extramarital affair.

But Mr Johnson’s father took a very different view, denouncing the BBC man for a ‘disgusting piece of journalism’ during Sunday’s interview.

Thumbs-up: The London Mayor (pictured today in a good mood) was left visibly flustered yesterday as the BBC's Mr Mair asked him repeatedly about a number of notorious incidents from his past

'Splendid job': Mr Johnson (pictured left cycling to work today) has shrugged off what happened during the interview yesterday and praised Mr Mair. He is pictured right visiting Dalston today

Visit: Mr Johnson and Metropolitan Police Service Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe joined members of the Dalston Safer Neighbourhood Team on their local beat to launch the Mayor's Police and Crime Plan today

Stanley Johnson, 72, said his son 
had been openly abused on the Andrew Marr Show, the corporation’s 
flagship weekend political programme, and claimed the BBC had ‘sunk 
about as low as it could’.

‘Eddie Mair’s interview was about the
most disgusting piece of journalism I’ve listened to for a very long 
time,’ he told LBC radio in London.

‘If grilling people about their 
private lives, accusing them of guilt by association and openly abusing 
them is a legitimate interview, then frankly, I don’t know where we are 
coming.

Anger: Stanley Johnson, pictured with his son Boris Johnson, has described the interview as 'disgusting'

‘I felt great anger at this man. I 
have no idea who Eddie Mair is or what he does, but frankly, there is 
such a thing as respecting the office, even if you don’t respect the 
man.

‘I don’t know where Eddie Mair’s 
politics come from, but I suspect he would not have treated the leader 
of the Labour Party in that way.’

During the broadcast the Mayor was 
pressed over whether he lied to then Tory leader Michael Howard about 
allegations of an affair in 2004 – which resulted in his resignation as 
shadow arts minister – as well as claims he was sacked from The Times 
more than two decades ago for making up a quote.

Out and about: Mr Johnson speaks to a member of the public while out on the beat with the Dalston Safer Neighbourhood Team today

'Within his rights': Mr Johnson today said Mr Mair was 'perfectly within his rights to have a bash at me'

Arrival: Mr Johnson (pictured arriving in East London today) today said: 'If a BBC presenter can't attack a nasty Tory politician what's the world coming to?'

Boris Johnson had his head in his hands after being grilled on live television by Eddie Mair yesterday

Insisting that he was talking about 
‘integrity’, Mr Mair turned to a 1990 telephone conversation Mr Johnson 
had with one of his friends who was demanding the private address of a 
News of the World journalist. A recording of the call suggested Mr 
Johnson had agreed to supply the details, even though his friend 
indicated he wanted to have the reporter beaten up for smearing his 
family.

Mr Mair then asked: ‘You are a nasty piece of work, aren’t you?’

But Boris Johnson said he had no 
problem at the approach taken by the interviewer, who is the regular 
presenter of Radio 4’s PM programme.

London Mayor Boris Johnson had to defend himself over questions about making up quotes, lying about an affair and giving out an address for a journalist to be beaten up

The Mayor told Eddie Mair, standing in for Andrew Marr, that he would not be watching the documentary made about him by Michael Cockerell

Mr Johnson appeared thrown as Eddie Mair grilled him on his sacking from The Times more than two decades ago for making up a quote

‘Eddie Mair did a splendid job. There is no doubt that is what the BBC is for – holding us to account.

‘I fully concede it wasn’t my most 
blistering performance, but that was basically because I was set to talk
about the Olympics and housing in London and he wanted to talk about 
other things, some of them – my private life and so on – of quite some 
antiquity, the details of which I wasn’t brilliant on.

'He was perfectly within his rights to have a bash at me – in fact it would have been shocking if he hadn’t.

‘If a BBC presenter can’t attack a nasty Tory politician what’s the world coming to?’

The controversy came as a new documentary was broadcast last night on Mr Johnson’s ambitions to become Prime Minister.

On the spot: London Mayor Johnson appeared thrown and confused as Eddie Mair grilled him on a number of subjects, including his sacking from The Times more than two decades ago for making up a quote

Uncomfortable: Boris Johnson was yesterday granted a prominent interview slot on BBC1. Its presenter, Eddie Mair, raised three rackety episodes from the Mayor's life and discerned a pattern of deceit, even of menace

In the BBC film, the Mayor went 
further than ever before in admitting that he would like to succeed 
David Cameron, who was two years below him at Eton and Oxford 
University.

‘Obviously, if the ball came loose 
from the back of a scrum – which it won’t – it would be a great, great 
thing to have a crack at,’ he said.

Asked if the interview had dented the
possibility of his son leading the Conservative Party or being Prime 
Minister, Mr Johnson senior replied: ‘Boris is clearly a political 
figure in this country.

‘From my point of view, he is not the
only Conservative political figure, but it seems to me perfectly 
legitimate that he should, in due course, have a chance to put his hat 
in the ring.’

In the documentary, Mr Johnson’s 
sister Rachel appeared to taunt Mr Cameron by recalling that her brother
was Captain of the School and elected to Eton’s elite group, known as 
Pop.

‘It gives Boris a sense of continuing superiority because he was Captain of the School,’ she said.

Edited transcript of yesterday’s TV confrontation:

EDDIE MAIR: The Times let you go after you made up a quote. Why did you make up a quote?

BORIS JOHNSON: These are big terms for what happened. Well, I can tell 
you the whole thing... Are you sure our viewers wouldn’t want to hear 
more about housing in London?

EM: Yes. You made something up. Let me ask about another little, er...

BJ: Well, I mean, I mildly sandpapered something somebody said, and yes it’s very embarrassing and I’m very sorry about it.

EM: Let me ask you about a barefaced lie. When you were in Michael 
Howard’s team, you denied to him you were having an affair. It turned 
out you were and he sacked you for that. Why did you lie to your party 
leader?

BJ: I never had any conversation with Michael Howard about that matter and, you know, I don’t propose...

EM: You did lie to him.

BJ: I don’t propose to go into all that again.

EM: The (Michael Cockerell) programme includes your reaction as you 
listen to a phone call in which your friend Darius Guppy asks you to 
supply the address of a journalist... so that he can have him physically
assaulted. The words “beaten up” and “broken ribs” are said to you...

BJ: Yes.

EM:... and you, having heard that, you tell your friend, Darius Guppy, 
you will supply the address. What does that say about you Boris Johnson?

BJ: Well I...

EM: Aren’t you, in fact, making up quotes, lying to your party leader, 
wanting to be part of someone being physically assaulted? You’re a nasty
piece of work, aren’t you?

BJ: Well, Eddie, I think of all three things I would dispute ...

EM: You don’t factually  dispute them.

BJ: Well I do. And I can, you know, if we had a long time, which we 
don’t, I could explain that I think all three interpretations you’re 
putting on those things aren’t wholly fair.

EM: Do you want to be Prime Minister?

BJ: It is completely nonsensical for me to indulge you know this increasingly... hysterical...

EM: What should the viewers make of your inability to give a straight answer to a straight question?

BJ: I think people would rightly conclude I don’t want to talk about this subject.
