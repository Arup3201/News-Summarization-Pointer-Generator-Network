A  reptile store owner was arrested Thursday in Quebec, Canada, more than a year after his 100-pound snake escaped and killed two young boys.

Jean-Claude Savoie's lawyer confirmed his arrest, but said authorities had not yet pressed charges and it's still unknown what crimes he may face.  Usually, police can only hold a suspect for 24 hours without an arraignment.

It was on August 5, 2013 that Savoie's best friend's two young sons Connor, 6, and Noah Barthe, 4, were killed during a sleepover at his apartment, located above his shop Reptile Ocean in Campbellton, New Brunswick.

Scene: The two young boys were sleeping over at Savoie's house above his reptile store in Campbellton, New Brunswick on August 5, 2013 when the snake escaped 

Killer? Savoie previously posted this picture of an African rock python to his Facebook, which may or may not be the 100-pound specimen which strangled the young boys to death

That night, Savoie's 14-foot African rock python escaped from its enclosure and crawled into the building's ventilation before dropping on top of the sleeping boys, and attacking them with a fatal squeeze.

Savoie's lawyer Leslie Matchim said Thursday that the arrest didn't come as a surprise, considering the year-long investigation. However, she says her client was previously informed that charges wouldn't be pressed when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police wrapped up their investigation in July.

'After they sort of recanted that position and announced that in fact the investigation was ongoing, then … I can't say that I’m surprised that we're at the point we're at today,' Matchim told CBC.

Animal lovers: Connor and Noah were the two sons of Savoie's best friend Mandy Tracertin, who posted the following pictures of them playing around in his store to Facebook

While charges have not been announced yet, there's a strong chance that they will be related to the boys' deaths as opposed to violations against the store. Savoie's store was discovered to be unlicensed, but the Department of Natural Resources decided not to proceed with charges on those counts. Those issues would have also been the responsibility of the local province - not the RCMP.

At the time of the tragic incident, MailOnline spoke to a reptile expert briefed by police who said that the snake had escaped from its enclosure before and was 'an accident waiting to happen'. 

'This was preventable, if the snake had been kept safe and secure,' Bry Loyst, curator of the Indian River Reptile Zoo in Ottowa, told MailOnline.

The two boys spent the day with Savoie and his son, swimming, barbecuing and playing with animals at a farm.  Connor and Noah were the sons of Savoie's best friend Mandy Trecartin. 

A reptile expert previously told MailOnline that the snake could have been attracted to the two boys because of the scent of animals on their bodies.   

'Sadly, the snake could have mistaken them for a food item, which they weren't',the owner of Little Ray's Zoo in Ottowa said at the time. 

In a tragic twist of fate, the two boys would have usually spent Saturday and Sunday with their dad - but he was out of town on a trip to Boston.
