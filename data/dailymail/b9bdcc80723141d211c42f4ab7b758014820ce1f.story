The Syrian government launched an offensive to retake rebel-held districts in the nation's commercial hub of Aleppo today, unleashing artillery, tanks and helicopter gunships against poorly armed opposition fighters.

Yet after a day of fighting, rebel forces remained in control, said activists, suggesting they had successfully fought off the government's initial assault.

The international community has raised an outcry about a possible massacre in this city of three million but acknowledged there was little they could do to stop the bloodshed.

The foreign minister of Russia, a 
powerful ally of Syria, said it was "simply unrealistic" for the Syrian 
regime to cede control.

The state-controlled al-Watan 
newspaper celebrated the assault with a banner headline proclaiming the 
fight for Aleppo 'the mother of all battles'.

The rebels are estimated to control 
between a third and a half of the districts in Aleppo, especially a 
cluster in the north-east around Sakhour neighbourhood and in the 
south-west.

They began their attempt to wrest 
this key city from the government's control a week ago. About 162 people
have been killed, mostly civilians, according to the Britain-based 
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which does not include soldiers in 
its toll.

Some 19,000 people have been killed since the uprising began in March 2011, estimated the group.

Today, activists estimate that at least two dozen have died so far in the day's fighting.

Local activist Mohammed Saeed said the
rebels have managed to keep the regime's tanks at bay so far with 
rocket-propelled grenades.

"The army hasn't been able to take any
neighbourhoods yet, there are too many from the Free Syrian Army," 
Saeed said, referring to the rebels.

He estimated that about 1,000 fighters
had poured into the city in the past few days to take on the Syrian 
army, which had been massing forces around the city ahead of its attack.

Tonight, according to the Observatory,
the government appeared to have pulled back from its ground offensive 
and was resuming its bombardment of various neighbourhoods with 
artillery. Attack helicopters pounded rebel positions.

The international community has expressed growing concern that there could be major bloodshed if Syrian troops retake Aleppo.

But Western nations and their allies 
have found themselves powerless to prevent the situation from 
deteriorating despite a series of diplomatic efforts, including a 
cease-fire agreement that never took effect.

In a statement, the Arab League 
expressed "deep dissatisfaction for the Syrian regime's acts of 
oppression," particularly the use of heavy weapons against its own 
people.

It urged Syria "to stop the cycle of killing and violence and 
lift the siege off the Syrian neighbourhoods under attack."

The group's deputy chief, Ahmed Ben 
Hali added that the Arab states were preparing a resolution in front of 
the United Nations General Assembly calling for the creation of safe 
havens to protect civilians and to apply further sanctions on the 
regime.

Measures passed in the General 
Assembly are largely symbolic and not binding. The West and its Arab 
allies have been unable to pass effective resolutions in the more 
powerful Security Council. China, and especially Syria's close ally, 
Russia, have vetoed any attempt to sanction Bashar Assad's regime.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
called the bloodshed in Aleppo a tragedy, but asked what else could the
government do against the rebellion.

"Now the city of Aleppo is occupied by
the armed opposition; another tragedy is imminent there," he said.

"How
can it be hoped that in such a situation the government will simply 
give in, say 'Okay, I wasn't right, overthrow me, change the regime - 
it's simply unrealistic."

Russia has been a key source of 
support for Syria, although Moscow officials in recent months have said 
they are simply taking a more even-handed approach while the West offers
support to the rebels.

French President Francois Hollande 
even chided Russia and China today, asking them to "take into 
consideration ... that it will be chaos and civil war if at some moment 
Assad isn't stopped".

It's been a difficult two weeks for 
the Syrian government, with assaults on its two main cities, a bomb that
killed four top security officials and a string of high-profile 
defections.

The country's military apparatus, 
though, has remained intact and continues to crush the opposition's 
remnants in Damascus and its outskirts.
