Police spent more than four hours besieging a house in an armed stand-off before realising that it had been empty all along.

Dozens of firearms officers, police dogs and a trained negotiator surrounded the building in Plymouth, Devon yesterday afternoon after reports of a man wielding a knife.

They cordoned off the quiet cul-de-sac and stopped neighbours from going into their homes.

Stand-off: Firearms officers spent more than four hours besieging an empty house in Plymouth, Devon

But after several hours, the suspect was found in a supermarket car park a mile away, and officer quickly left the scene.

The siege began at 2.30pm yesterday when Devon and Cornwall Police received reports that a gas worker had been threatened with a large knife.

The victim fled in his van as armed officers with shields and body armour flooded the residential street.

Neighbours were ordered to stay behind a cordon as the marksmen took up positions outside the house where they believed the knifeman was hiding.

Locals counted more than a dozen police cars and vans and two ambulances lining the leafy road throughout the course of the siege.

But at 7pm, the police packed up and left when they heard that the suspect had been arrested a mile away.

Local resident Hollie Wright said: 'We came back at about 3.30pm and the police were here already. There were armed police all around the street and the streets behind.

'I was speaking to the lady who lives next door to him and she hadn't been able to get back in for four hours.'

A police spokesman said officers had not known whether or not the suspect was inside the house.

She said: 'We were called to an address on Yewdale Gardens yesterday with reports of a man in possession of a knife and threatening another man outside the property. The victim left the area uninjured and alerted police.

'A 41-year-old from Plymouth was arrested in the ASDA supermarket car park on suspicion of affray and possession of a bladed article and remains in custody in Plymouth.'
