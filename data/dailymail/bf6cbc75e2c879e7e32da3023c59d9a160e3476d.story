A Malaysia Airlines jet was forced to dump fuel and turn back to Kuala Lumpur Airport on Sunday after a technical problem.

Earlier reports said Flight MH198, heading for Hyderabad in India, was on fire, but the airline dismissed this and said the problem was with the auto-pilot.

Although the aircraft landed safely back at Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 2am on Sunday, it was yet another incident that the airline could do without.

It has been plagued by the disappearance of MH370, the crash of MH17 and a number of 'smaller' incidents that have resulted in aircraft turning back or making an emergency landing.

In a statement later today Malaysia Airlines said the turn-back to the airport was due to an auto-pilot defect.

Denying initial claims that the aircraft had been on fire, the airline said the defect did not have any impact on the safety of the jet or the passengers, the number of whom was not immediately available.

'As a precautionary measure, the captain decided to turn back to the airport,' said a spokesman.

'Upon arrival, passengers and crew disembarked safely and were given accommodation at nearby hotels.'

The jet arrived at the airport some four hours after take off.

Earlier, a flight-tracking website reported that MH198 was in a holding pattern and 'burning fuel' after departure.

It is thought that the 'burning fuel' description had given rise to claims that the aircraft was on fire.

Malaysia Airlines has lost two Boeing 777-220s this year, with the mystery disappearance of MH370 and the bringing down of MH17 over eastern Ukraine.

The Hyderabad-bound flight was due to resume later on Sunday.
