A maniac Chinese chef, who attacked his wife and her lover with a meat cleaver after he discovered them in bed together told relatives he wanted to 'cut them up like a piece of pork'.

Cook Sun Li turned his home in Foshan, Guangdong province, into a bloodbath when he discovered his wife cheating on him after coming in from work.

Crazed Sun hacked at the cheating pair 
with the heavyweight metal cooking utensil as they fled through the 
house and out into the street. The pair both suffered injuries but 
survived.

A police spokesman said: 'There were spurts of blood, and footprints and handprints everywhere. It was like a slaughterhouse inside.

'It was amazing that they could lose so much blood and survive,' said one police officer.

Sun was later arrested drenched in blood after relatives persuaded him to give up the chopper.
