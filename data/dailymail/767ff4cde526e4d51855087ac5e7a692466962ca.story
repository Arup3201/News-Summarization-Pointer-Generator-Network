Pictured with his first bike in 1954, Nick Thomas spent six months in the 60s hitch-hiking from Sydney to Magnetic Island at only 16 

At 16 years of age, with less than two pence to his name and only his best mate beside him, Nick Thomas set out to hitch-hike 2000km from Sydney to Magnetic Island in Queensland.

Over the next six months the two teenagers, who sought a promised fortune, came face-to-face with the kooky characters and unique landscapes that made-up Australia's outback in the 1960s.

More than 50 years later, Mr Thomas' memories and diary entries from the time have been published into the book Once A Pommie Swagman; a memoir of sorts which celebrates and looks 'back at a time and a way of life that no longer exists'.

'It was the characters who got me writing the book,' Mr Thomas told Daily Mail Australia, 'the characters are worth remembering.'

From stealing food, crashing cars, picking fruit, camping by the roadside, hitch-hiking with truck drivers and farm widows, being thrown into jail and being taken in and fed by families who were 'flabbergasted to see two boys travelling on their own'- the book records a range of mischief in which the two boys partook. 

Mr Thomas explained how in an era of unlocked front doors, he and his childhood friend Glen learnt to survive on the road while stealthily taking showers in random pubs in the early hours of the morning.

The teenager (pictured here in 1959 at Epping Boys High School, bottom row, very centre) went on the adventure alongside with only two pence to his name and only his best mate Glen by his side 

'We would just go up the resident stairs and walk along the corridor to have a shower – and you'd wash your clothes while you're doing it,' Mr Thomas said.

'We got caught up in Julia Creek though, which was a bit traumatic. This bloke came out of a room down near the stairs at the bottom of the hall – the toilets were always at the far end of the hall, you see – wearing a pair of underpants and a blue singlet, just your typical country Australian.

'He called out "What room are you two in?" and I just quickly answered "14".

'His arm instantly shot out towards the back of my neck and smashed me into the wall when I said that. "14 my arse!" Of course, there were only nine rooms in the hotel.

More than 50 years later, Mr Thomas (pictured with his elder sister Sally) has published his memories from the trip in the book Once A Pommie Swagman

With his father and sister at Avoca beach in 1953: The book details all the mischief the two boys got up to including  stealing food, crashing cars, camping by the roadside, and being thrown into jail

'We had to paint the roof of the hotel for that and of course there was drama to follow with that because Glen was afraid of heights.'

However, the book serves as a record of more sombre times in Australia too; an era when the country still directed hate and prejudice towards both immigrants and Aboriginal people.

'Australia still had a white Australia policy then – racially vilifying and and insulting foreigners was common. Whether you were Japanese or Italian or a Pom, it didn't matter, we were all insulted. The book is also a reflection of that, not in a bitter or resentful way, that's just how it was,' Mr Thomas said.

It recalls a particularly appalling example of this attitude directed towards an Aboriginal man which was witnessed by Nick and Glen just outside Charters Towers in Northern Queensland as they tried to light a fire by the side of the road.

'We were just sitting on side of road when suddenly a police car came and stopped about 200 yards away from us and a cop got out and dragged out an Aboriginal man who was just paralytic drunk,' Mr Thomas recalled.

Army recruit training in Ingleburn, NSW, in 1962 at age 18: Mr Thomas fought in the Vietnam War and developed post-traumatic stress disorder

'He pushed him out the side of car and punched him in his stomach and we heard him yell "and stay out," presumably as he was kicking him out of town. Then he looked around and kicked the Aborigine in the groin and just drove off.

'We had been hiding, but when we got up to see how the Aboriginal man was, the cop had seen us and he drove back and gave us a grilling. We were vagrants so he was saying things like "I can arrest you at any time", "I'll arrest you for resisting arrest" and "if anyone hears about this, I'll know who told them".'

Nick adventures came to an abrupt end when his mother arrived from New Guinea after speaking to his sister, who he contacted regularly. 

Determined to make something of her son, 'she took me by the ear lobe and dragged me to the recruiting office and I joined the army,' Mr Thomas said. 

From that moment onward, life took on a different tone for Mr Thomas, who fought in the Vietnam War and developed a debilitating version of post-traumatic stress disorder that would haunt him for the next 40 years.

He spent 10 and a half months on the ground with only four days break, in what he describes as necessary 'rifle gripping tension'.

'Even at the base camp which was portrayed as 'easy with steaks and beer', every time we went outside the wire someone came back minus a foot or dead. 182 people were wounded and 25 men were lost, that's almost one every one and a half days so that keeps you alert and tense,' he said.

'It does things to you and you need to have this tension to keep you watchful and alert and alive. Once you've got into that mode it's not an easy function to turn off.' 

Due to understanding the struggles associated with returning from war, Mr Thomas is donating a portion of the sales from Once A Pommie Swagman to war veteran associations.

Reminiscing of simpler times, he admitted that he had attempted to retrace his steps 14 years after his journey in 1975 alongside his wife Veronica. However, none of the characters that made the adventure such an enduring memory were still there.
