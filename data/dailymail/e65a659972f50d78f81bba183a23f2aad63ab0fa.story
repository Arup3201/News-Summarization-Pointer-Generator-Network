The family of slain aspiring model and actress Juliana Redding maintains justice has not been served that once had prosecutors insinuating she was the victim of spurned love and a business deal gone sour.

Dr.
Munir Uwaygah, who has never been charged in her death, fled the United States two days after the woman accused 
of brutally slaying 21-year-old aspiring model and actress Juliana 
Redding for pay was arrested.

Now
Redding’s family, including her father Greg Redding - who cancelled a 
business deal with Uwaygah just five days before his daughter’s murder - must live with the agonizing knowledge that whoever is responsible for Juliana's death may never pay.

Entangled: Dr. Munir Uwaydah (left) fled
the country two days after the woman once accused of brutally murdering Juliana Redding (right) was arrested and is now said to be living out his life in Beirut, Lebanon

Her
father, a pharmacist, had agreed to go into business with Dr Uwaydah, 
managing a pharmacy and helping to develop products for a medical 
manufacturing company the Lebanese American businessman had founded.

This,
according to a 48 Hours investigation that portrays a sordid tale with 
few winners other than, perhaps, the Lebanese-American surgeon.

Kelly
Soo Park, 47, was acquitted in 2013 of charges she viciously attacked 
Redding in her Santa Monica, California in 2008, bashing in her skull and strangling her so forcefully that a bone 
was crushed behind her throat.

Prosecutors at the time said alleged Park was carrying out orders from Uwaydah.

Though
her DNA was found throughout the crime scene, prosecutors were unable to pin Park to the murder in the eyes of 
the jury.

Beauty: Juliana Redding was murdered in her Santa Monica apartment in 2008 and DNA from a woman who prosecutors then alleged worked for her ex-boyfriend Dr. Uwaydah was found all over her home and on her neck

While Park now
manages a Southern California restaurant, the man alleged in her trial to have 
given her a six-figure payment to kill Redding remains uncharged.

Friends and family members of the slain model erupted in tears and screams when the jury acquitted Park in June.

Onlookers in the courtroom who knew Redding screamed obscenities and called Park a murderer.

They appeared ready to pounce on Park and were held back by deputies as she turned and was led through a rear entrance.

‘Go to hell. Whore!’ was screamed by a woman in the court.

‘Somethings wrong here,’ said a female voice. ‘God bless us all.’

Jurors had been escorted out a back way before the outburst.

Now
there is no one left to pay for Redding’s horrific murder and the man once named in connection to the killing is living thousands of miles and many countries away.

In Park's trial, 'The prosecution's motive was that Dr Uwaydah was in business negotiations with Juliana Redding's father,' reporter Jack Leonard told 48 Hours. '…that motive involved Juliana's father breaking off business negotiation with him just days before Juliana's murder.'

The reknowned surgeon was known to own property across the world including at least one Beverly Hills home and a horse farm.

Prior
to the Maxim cover girl’s murder, Uwaydah attempted to go into business
with Miss Redding's father, Greg, an Arizona pharmacist.

However,
Greg Redding began his own background check into the doctor and 
discovered that Uwaydah was lying about his age, was married and had a 
family.

Acquitted: Kelly Soo Park had been accused on killing model Juliana Redding with her bare hands in March of 2008. The jury in her 2013 trial was unable to convict her

On learning of Uwaydah's history--and that he was and continues to be a married man--Juliana ended their affair and her father also stopped the business venture he planned with Uwaydah.

Greg Redding sent Uwaydah a letter on March 10 ending their business relationship - five days before his daughter was killed.

Prosecutors
said that Uwaydah made six-figure payments to Park and her family 
before the killing and before Park's arrest. They said he had also 
bragged that he had a 'female James Bond' ready to act.

It
took two years to discover a suspect in the murder and investigators 
linked Park through DNA evidence found on Redding's neck.

Unproven: Prosecutors said Dr Munir 
Uwaydah (left) had hired Kelly Soo Park (right) to kill Redding after a business deal with her father went sour. Now, Park works as a restaurant manager in Southern California and Uwaydah is living out his life in Beirut, Lebanon

It took seven days for the jury to come to their decision in Park’s case.

It will take a lifetime for the Redding family and for Juliana’s friends to come to grips with the circumstances of her death.

The family declined to comment much on the case to 48 Hours, and sent only a written statement in response to their interview requests:

‘Our
family is deeply saddened and shocked…we believe the evidence against 
the defendant is enormous and that justice has not been served.’
