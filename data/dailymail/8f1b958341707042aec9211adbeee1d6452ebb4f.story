The deadly Ebola virus poses a 'very serious threat' to Britain, it was warned today as the government convened a meeting of its Cobra emergency committee.

Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered ministers to review measures needed to protect Britons at home and abroad.

It comes as a man has been tested for the Ebola virus in Birmingham while another also went to Charing Cross Hospital in London fearing he he was infected.

Doctors have been put on red alert for signs that the outbreak which has killed more than 670 people in West Africa could be heading to the UK.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond chaired the Cobra meeting today, in an escalation of the government's response to the crisis.

He said the UK government was examining the risks of the 'new and emerging threat'.

He told Sky News: 'As far as we are aware, there are no British nationals so far affected by this outbreak and certainly no cases in the UK. 

'However the Prime Minister does regard it as a very serious threat and I will be chairing a Cobra meeting later today to assess the situation and look at any measures that we need to take either in the UK, or in our diplomatic posts abroad in order to manage the threat.

'We are very much focused on it as a new and emerging threat which we need to deal with.' 

Hospitals and medical centres across the UK remain on red alert for the virus, with doctors being told to look out for symptoms of the disease which can go unnoticed for three weeks and kills 90 per cent of victims.

Concern: Ebola (above) has already killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and infected more than 1,200 since it was first diagnosed in February. Symptoms include sudden fever, vomiting and headaches

Virus: Symptoms of Ebola include high fever, bleeding, damage to the nervous system and vomiting

The Department of Health confirmed protections have been put in place to deal with the deadly bug, should it spread to Britain.

A spokesman said: ‘We are well prepared to identity and deal with any potential cases of Ebola, although there has never been a case in this country.’

The Government’s chief scientific advisor also issued a frank warning about the disease, which he said could have a ‘major impact’ on the UK.

Sir Mark Walport said: ‘The UK is fortunate in its geographical position. We’re an island. But we are living in a completely interconnected world where disruptions in countries far away will have major impacts.

‘The most dangerous infections of humans have always been those which have emerged from other species,’ he told the Daily Telegraph, referring to the virus originating in fruit bats and monkeys.

He said the Government was ‘keeping a close eye’ on the outbreak and was prepared for the disease spreading to Britain, but insisted any risk was ‘very low’.

He added: ‘We have to think about risk and managing risk appropriately.’

Public Health England has added to fears about the spread of the virus by saying it was ‘clearly not under control’. 

What is Ebola virus disease?

Ebola
 is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per 
cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, 
gorillas and chimpanzees.How do people become infected with the virus?

Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals.

In
 Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with 
chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and 
porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest.

Once
 a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a 
sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also 
become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled
 clothing, bed linen or used needles.

Men
 who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to 
their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery.

Who is most at risk?

Those at risk during an outbreak include:

What are the typical signs and symptoms?

Sudden
 onset of fever, intense weakness,  muscle pain, headache and sore 
throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney 
and liver function and internal and external bleeding.

The incubation period is bet ween two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms.

When should you seek medical care?

If
 a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact
 with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek 
medical help immediately.What is the treatment?

Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them.

But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented?

Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use.

Is it safe to travel to affected areas?

The
 World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation 
regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The
 risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person 
transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.Source: World Health Organisation
