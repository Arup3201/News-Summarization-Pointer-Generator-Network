A thief who stole more than £500 by attaching a device to catch people's money at cash machines has been jailed for two years.

Romanian Marcel Dumitru, 35, stole money from eight different ATM users by fixing the device on machines at a Post Office and a Morrisons supermarket in Greater Manchester.

The scam saw customers attempting to withdraw cash greeted with an error message on the ATM's screen.

Instead, their money would be trapped by Dumitru's device and the thief would wait until customers had walked away empty handed before collecting the cash himself.

Police are still searching for Dumitru's alleged accomplice Petre Ionita, 27, who was also due to appear at the same hearing but jumped bail back in March.

Bolton Crown Court heard that Dumitru, who is currently serving ten months in prison for attempted theft and possessing articles for use in fraud, had previously been jailed for fitting card skimming devices to cash machines.

But Dumitru resumed his criminal activities upon his release from custody in late 2012.

He used a device with a metal or plastic pad with a sticky plate attached to prevent people's money from being dispensed from two cash machines in Bury between December 2012 and February 2013.

Dumitru and Ionita were eventually arrested when officers on patrol in Bolton stopped their blue Ford Escort.

Officers searched the car and found that the sat nav had various cash points and Post Offices in its destination history along with 30 blank credit cards, six rolls of double sided tape and two silver plastic carpet grips.

Ionita was granted bail but disappeared on March 14.

The court heard that Dumitru, of Longsight, Manchester, was one of three men arrested in 2011 after fitting card-skimming devices to a cash machine in Aberdeen.

The men were seen attaching the device to the top of a cash machine at a Co-op store.

The following day a customer who tried to use it received an 'error' message which said his card would be retained.

But he could still see his card and managed to pull it free from the machine bringing a card-skimming device with it.

Dumitru was caught when he returned to the cash machine and was seen by a member of staff who called police after recognising him from footage showing the group fitting the device.

He was jailed for five months for the offence.

Both Dumitru and Ionita were jailed for 16 months in February 2012 after a similar scam.

Dumitru is also currently serving a 10 month sentence at Dovegate jail in Staffordshire imposed in June after he was convicted of similar offences relating to attempted theft and possessing articles for use in fraud in Kidsgrove, near Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Sergeant Harrison White, of Greater Manchester Police said follwing Dumitru's sentencing: 'He used an improvised cash-trap device to con bank customers into thinking the ATMs were faulty.

'Dumitru cynically preyed on people’s confusion to go back after they’d left, retrieve their device and pocket whatever cash had been dispensed.

'The device may have been improvised and relatively crude, but this was a well-planned attempt to steal from innocent members of the public.'
