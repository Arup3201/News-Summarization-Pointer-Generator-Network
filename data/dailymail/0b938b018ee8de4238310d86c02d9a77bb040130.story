Oscar De La Hoya has tipped Manny Pacquiao to cause 'some damage' against Floyd Mayweather during their May 2 showdown in Las Vegas.

De La Hoya knows all about both boxers having lost to both Pacquiao and Mayweather during his professional career and believes the Filipino will be a tough challenge for the unbeaten American due to his southpaw stance.

The Golden Boy Promotions founder, who lost to Mayweather in May 2007 and Pacquiao in June 2008, also revealed his excitement at being able to see the two box office fighters go toe-to-toe in the ring.

Oscar De La Hoya believes Floyd Mayweather will face a tough test when he takes on Manny Pacquiao 

De La Hoya, speaking to Fight Hype, said: 'It's just gratifying to know that his fight is finally taking place.

'On May 2 we are finally going to have the opportunity to watch Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao.

'A lot of people can argue it is maybe a few years too late but I really do feel that Mayweather and Pacquiao still have a lot left in the tank to make it a really good fight. As a boxing fan I'm really looking forward to it.

'I have always preached to the boxing fans, to the writers and the reporters that we must demand the best fights. We must demand the best fighting the best. 

Mayweather defeated De La Hoya at the MGM Grand Garden Arena back in May 2007

De La Hoya also fell to a defeat against Pacquiao during a bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in June 2008

'As long as the public is asking for these great fights then we have a great chance of seeing them.'

When asked if Pacquiao will be Mayweather's hardest test to date, De La Hoya replied: 'I believe so because you have take into account that Pacquiao is a southpaw. 

'If he has the legs for 12 rounds to move inside, outside, side to side and throw a lot of punches then I really do feel that Pacquiao can do some damage to Mayweather.

'But then again Mayweather is a masterful boxer. He is a master at defence so it is just going to be a really entertaining fight.'
