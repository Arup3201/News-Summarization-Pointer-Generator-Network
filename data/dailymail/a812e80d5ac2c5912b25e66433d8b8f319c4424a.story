Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and ordered to pay back $17.6m.

The graft case against the 86-year-old Mubarak, who is kept in custody at a military hospital, is one of two against the former president who was ousted in a popular uprising in 2011 after nearly three decades in power.

He is being retried over the killings of hundreds of protesters during the uprising.

Mubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were also convicted Wednesday of graft and sentenced to four years in prison each in the same case.

The three Mubaraks were convicted of charges that they $17.6m worth of state funds in over a decade toward the end of Hosni Mubarak's rule.

The funds were meant for renovating and maintaining presidential palaces but were instead spent on upgrading the family's private residences.

Mubarak, 86, was thrust into office when Islamists gunned down his predecessor Anwar Sadat at a military parade in 1981.

The burly former air force commander proved a far more durable leader than anyone imagined at the time - he was ousted in 2011.

He is married to Suzanne, who is half-British and during his nearly 30 year time in power he survived six assassination attempts.

But over the years his health began to fail - it was reported he was suffering from heart problems.

Following mass protests in Cairo and other cities, Mr 
Mubarak announced he had decided not to stand for re-election later that
 year. But the protests continued on 10 February he announced he would remain president, but was handing over his powers.

The following day Vice-President Omar Suleiman announced Mr Mubarak was stepping down and the country would be ruled by the military's supreme council.

In June 2012 he was found guilty of failing to stop the killing of more than 900 protesters during the 18-day revolt against his rule and sentenced to life imprisonment.

His conviction was overturned in January 2013. That was appealed by prosecutors, and a retrial began in April 2013.

He was released in August last year pending his graft trial, but was kept at a military hospital in a suburb south of Cairo.

Since his ouster, Mubarak's supporters have released conflicting details about his health, including that he suffered a stroke, a heart attack and at times went into a coma.

His wife has been living in Cairo and keeping a low-profile, occasionally visiting Mubarak and their two sons in prison.

Hosni Mubarak 'had an obligation to 
restrain himself and his sons from stealing state funds ... but instead,
 he gave himself and his sons license to embezzle them,' Judge Osama 
Shaheen said as he handed down the verdict.

The three Mubaraks were also fined 21.1 million Egyptian pounds ($2.9 million).

They were also ordered to reimburse 125 million Egyptian pounds ($17.6 million) to the state treasury.

They have the right to appeal their conviction before a higher court.

The Mubaraks had returned around 120 million Egyptian pounds to the state in connection with this case, but the proceedings against them continued.

Four other defendants in the case were acquitted. 

Mubarak, who turned 86 this month, attended Wednesday's hearing in a suit and tie.

His two sons wore white prison uniforms. 

They
 have all been held in custody since 2011, but only time in custody in 
connection with this case - about a year since the embezzlement charges 
were raised - will be deducted from the sentences.

Under
 Egyptian law, maximum sentences for embezzlement vary depending on the 
nature of the crime, but 15 years' imprisonment is not uncommon.

 was found guilty in June 2012 of failing to stop the killing of more 
than 900 protesters during the 18-day revolt against his rule and 
sentenced to life imprisonment.

That was appealed by prosecutors, and a retrial began in April 2013.

 was ordered released in August last year pending his graft trial, but 
was kept at a military hospital in a suburb south of Cairo.

Given his poor health, Mubarak is likely to serve his sentence in the hospital.

Mubarak's sons are also being retried on separate graft charges.
