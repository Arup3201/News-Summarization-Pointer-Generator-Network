Even the Star of David could be banned, if used in the context of the atrocities committed in WWII

Israel has passed the first step on the road to more severe banning of the use of Nazi symbols and offensive ideology.

The ban would stop the use of all Nazi symbols and expressing remorse for the fall of the Nazi regime, and would make calling someone a Nazi illegal, with a punishment of up to six months in prison and a fine of 100,000 shekels (around £20,000).

In addition, the law would ban the use of the Jewish Star of David symbol when used in the context of the internment camps or in reference to the holocaust.

The bill has passed its first reading, but still has two more readings before it can become a law.

The first reading of the bill, submitted by MK Shimon Ohayon passed largely unopposed, receiving 44 votes for and 17 MKs voting against.

The bill was approved on Sunday by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation, meaning that it stands a better chance of becoming a law because it has the backing of the coalition government.

An effort to pass a similar bill happened a few years before, but was voted down because many believed the existing laws were tough enough, and worried that newer, tougher laws might affect free speech.

General Attorney Yehuda Weinstien, who had reservations about the possible ban

The bill says the word 'Nazi' would be banned for anything other than 'for the purpose of learning, documentation, scientific study or historical accounts.'

Also, using words that sound like 'Nazi' to indirectly refer to someone as an insult would also incur punishment.

The bill reads: 'Insulting someone by expressing the wish, hope, or anticipation for the fulfillment of the Nazis’ aims, or expressing sorrow or protest that they were not accomplished is forbidden.'

'Unfortunately, the phenomenon of using Nazi symbols and epithets has grown in recent years. The intolerable ease with which the day-to-day usage of these concepts as part of public and political discourse, and with blatant disregard for the feelings of Holocaust survivors and their descendants, is reprehensible.'

It received objections from Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, saying that it might raise constitutional problems.

He said: 'Not all behavior that offends the public 
deserves to be made a crime.

'Is
 it proper in a democratic country to ban an entire world of images from
 the public discourse to protect people’s feelings?'

'Given the centrality and importance of the 
constitutional right to freedom of expression, any restriction on it 
must be examined meticulously and with exceptional caution.'
