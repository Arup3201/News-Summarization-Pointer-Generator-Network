The Georgia woman battling a rare bacterial infection that caused her to lose her hands and feet has died in hospital today after her school teacher husband was denied the time off work to be with her.

Hannah Rinehart, 32, who had battled through three bouts of cancer before being struck down with an infection caught from her puppy on July 3rd, passed away from multiple organ failure at Northside Hospital in Cumming in the early hours of Wednesday.

Spending nine weeks in a medically-induced coma after going into septic shock, Rinehart's passing was announced by her husband Mark as he wrote on his Facebook page, 'At exactly 0415 this morning, Hannah Johnson Rinehart went to be with the Lord.'

Hannah Rinehart's story had made national headlines earlier in the month when her husband battled to extend the 20 days of sick leave he was entitled to annually.

Anticipating that his wife would need round the clock care if she recovered, Mark Rinehart was ultimately denied any exceptions and was told that he would have only have 20 days.

This was despite his co-workers offering to donate their own sick leave time to him so that he could be be by his wife's side during her convalesence, but they were told they could not do that.

In late August, Mark Rinehart did return to work for the start of the new academic year, calling it a 'difficult, but necessary decision.'

Updating his Facebook on Tuesday to say that he was taking the 20 days from that point on, tragically his wife died less than 24 hours after he made that decision.

It is thought that Rinehart contracted capnocytophaga, an infection usually found in the saliva of dogs. Her husband Mark said he did not know if their one-year-old dog, Brownie, bit her.

'It was basically like being struck by lightning,' Mr Rinehart told the Gwinnett Daily Post. 'It doesn’t happen.'

As the sepsis set in doctors were forced to amputate the nurse's hands and feet after her body went into shock and she suffered circulatory problems.

Staying in a medically induced coma for over two months before her death, the effects of her illness had ravaged her body.

'The doctor wanted to meet with the entire family, and my assumption was that the meeting would be very difficult,' said a Facebook update from Mark Rinehart yesterday afternoon.

Hannah Rinehart became ill after contracting capnocytophaga. It had a significant effect as her immune system had been weakened by cancer and two bone marrow transplants.The rare infection is only usually a danger to elderly, infirm or those with underlying diseases.Capnocytophaga is found in the throat of mammals and can be passed to humans through bite wounds.The bacteria can cause septicemia, meningitis, rare eye infections and endocarditis - an inflammation of the heart.Symptoms often include fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, confusion, muscle pain or malaise. It can also bring on septic shock.When discovered, it can be treated with anti-microbial medications.

'The family’s immediate reaction to the meeting was a sigh of relief, as no new decisions needed to be made.

'However, the message from the doctor was clear; Hannah is in critical condition and she has been in ICU for 9 weeks. As such, Hannah is very, very tired.

'Unfortunately, Hannah’s current circumstances are limiting our options.

'Many people have asked if Hannah is a candidate for lung transplant.

'Although we all wish that Hannah could be a candidate for transplant, the truth is she is not.

'Even prior to our trip to the ICU in early July, Hannah’s heart condition from her cancer treatments (cardiomyopathy – ‘weak heart muscle’) would prevent her from being a candidate.'

Hannah Rinehart had beaten cancer three times since the age of 18; she suffered from Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was in remission for seven years.

She underwent two bone marrow transplants, which weakened her immune system and made her more susceptible to the bacteria, MyFoxAtlanta reported.

Despite these struggles, her husband, a schoolteacher and national guardsman, said she has always been upbeat.

'You see people around who have had a tough time and are bitter about it,' Mr Rinehart told WXIA.

'She's not; she's always excited about living. She's a fighter, I married a fighter.

'It's just another stage in our life. I know when she comes out of this she's going to be smiling just as big as she was before.'

He added to Fox: 'She's got a passion for living and she was grateful for every day she had after [cancer] and she's going to be grateful for every day she has after this.'

Her father, Doug Johnson, said it has devastated the family but they have come together to fight it.

'You cry a lot,' he told Fox. 'It's not something you every want to go through. You could never want your worst enemy to have anything like this every happen to them.'

Andy Copeland, the father of Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old Snellville woman who fought a different rare infection that led to the amputation of her limbs, expressed his condolences to Mark Rinehart.

'We are very deeply saddened to learn of Hannah Rinehart’s passing,' Andy Copeland told the AJC.

'She and Mark and her family have been ever present in our prayer lives. We had hoped and prayed for her full recovery, but there’s no rhyme nor reason for her suffering and untimely passing.

'Only God knows and understands such things and it is He who now benefits from Hannah’s glowing presence amongst the angels.'
