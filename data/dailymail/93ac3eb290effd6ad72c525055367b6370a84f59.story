Contrary to popular belief, Lewis Hamilton hasn't had the best of luck in Brazil, but home Formula One fans want to claim him as one of their own.

Ahead of Sunday's race, the championship leader was handed a mock oversized passport and a football kit adorned with his face by a wacky Brazilian TV comedy duo.

And a delighted-looking Hamilton bought into the joke, holding the comedy props with an enormous grin.

While he won his only world title  with a dramatic, last-gasp fifth-place finish in 2008, since that unforgettable afternoon his record at Interlagos has been unspectacular.

He's never finished higher than third and has failed to finish two of the last three races in South America. 

Yet this year he heads into the penultimate race of the season with a healthy-looking 24 point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg after four wins from the last five races. 

Hamilton examines his new kit

Hamilton knows there is still all to play with 75 points up for grabs.

'You don't really look five or 10 races ahead. I've just always kept my head down, kept chipping away,' said Hamilton.

'I had those four wins (early in the season), and then there was the bad patch from Monaco onwards.

'Then Spa was like 'I'm going to turn this up. I'm going to have to turn this up. This means war', that kind of feeling. In reflecting on it, I turned the energy from that negative bomb into a positive.'

And Hamilton is all-too aware that Rosberg can snatch the title, particularly with double points up for grabs in Abu Dhabi on November 23.

'I'm not sure I do have an edge,' said Hamilton.

'Every weekend Nico resets, he comes in and qualifies on pole. He's massively strong mentally. He's still there, still fighting.'
