Crack shot: The Duke of Edinburgh, pictured 10 days ago, has had to miss the Royals' annual pheasant shoot

The Duke of Edinburgh was said to be in ‘good spirits’ yesterday despite facing his fourth night in hospital following emergency heart surgery.

As the Daily Mail revealed yesterday, Prince Philip has been urging doctors to release him as soon as possible and, according to one senior royal source, has been in ‘genuinely good form’.

But senior medics at Papworth Hospital, in Cambridgeshire, are said to be taking no chances with the 90-year-old royal’s health and decided to keep him under observation for another night.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘The Duke of Edinburgh continues to make good progress from the procedure.

'He remains in hospital under observation and in good spirits.’

The Queen, who remains at Sandringham, her private Norfolk estate, is being kept  informed about her husband’s progress.

Other royals went ahead yesterday with their traditional Boxing Day pheasant shoot – normally organised by crack shot Philip – at his request.

The senior royal began experiencing severe chest pains on Friday night and was airlifted to Papworth’s specialist cardiothoracic unit for surgery on a blocked artery.

His wife, children and grandchildren have all been to see him, although it is believed the duke did not receive any family visitors yesterday.

British designer, while the Queen wore a lavender coat with a glittering
diamond and pearl brooch

The irascible royal hates fuss and 
when he was hospitalised for four days with a chest infection in 2008 he
refused to receive any well-wishers, instead catching up on his 
paperwork.

Although it is expected that the duke
will  make a full recovery from his ordeal, questions were being asked 
yesterday as to whether he would be able to continue with his busy 
schedule of public engagements when he and the Queen return to work from
their Christmas break in early February.

Despite his age, Philip still 
undertakes around 350 engagements a year and in 2011 undertook two 
gruelling foreign tours with his wife – to Australia and Ireland.

Next year sees the worldwide 
celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. She and her husband are due 
to undertake a comprehensive tour of the UK to mark the occasion.

Surrounded! Catherine happily chatted as the public swarmed to meet Prince William's stunning wife

‘It’s just too early to say what will happen,’ a source told the Mail yesterday.

‘Inevitably the duke will want it to be business as usual but he may have no choice but to slow down.’

Meanwhile the Duchess of Cambridge continues to enjoy her first Christmas as a royal.

All eyes were on Kate as she attended
church at Sandringham for the first time on Christmas morning – and as 
always, critics were poring over her choice of outfit.

She won praise for the eye-catching, plum made-to-measure Jane Corbett hat she wore for the occasion.

And although the newly-married 
duchess has her pick of priceless jewels to choose from as a female 
member of the royal family, she opted for  £1,900 diamond and citrine 
earrings – thought to have been a Christmas present.

The earrings were by Chelsea-based 
Kiki McDonough, whose designs were once worn by Kate’s husband Prince 
William’s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales.

The duchess completed her look with a
pair of vertiginous black suede heels by Spanish designer Mascaro, made
especially for the occasion.

A spokesman for the family firm, founded in Menorca, said: ‘They were a special request from her office.’

Kate paid the full price of £169 for the shoes, as her staff said she was unable to accept gifts
