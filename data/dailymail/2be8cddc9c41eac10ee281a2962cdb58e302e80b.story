A dozy burglar got much more than he bargained for when  he decided to break into a school but ended up smashing his way into a police station instead.

John Dettor from Washington, D.C., 59, broke into the police station in Shelburne, Vermont just before midnight last week. 

But he was left red-faced when the  school actually turned out to be the local police station.

Traffic cone: Shelburne Police said Dettor used a traffic cone to break the glass to get inside

Shelburne Police said Dettor, who is homeless, used a traffic cone to break the glass to get inside.

He was arrested on suspicion of unlawful mischief and ended up in the Chittenden Correctional Center.  

Dettor told police that he had genuinely believed that  the police station was a school and had broken in because he was looking for a warm place to stay, according to WFFF-TV.

It was not immediately known if the man had a lawyer.

He was due to be arraigned on September 19.
