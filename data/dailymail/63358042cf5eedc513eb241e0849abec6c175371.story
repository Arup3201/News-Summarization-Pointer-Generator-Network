Laura and Kevin Stier weren't even trying to get pregnant when they defied extreme genetic odds and conceived identical triplets without any help from fertility specialists.

Now the couple have just brought their identical daughters home from the hospital after being watched for more than three 
months after their delivery.

There is a one in 8,000 chance of conceiving triplets naturally, and the while chances of identical triplets get even more slim and range from 1-in-60,000 to 1-in-2,000,000.

Twins are the most common form of multiple birth, and the whether a pair are identical or fraternal is determined by the number of eggs involved.

When two separate eggs are fertilized during the same cycle, the children are fraternal twins while identical twins are produced when one egg splits into two embryos meaning that the two children would share genetic material.

Triplets are more of a rarity, and can be the result of a variety of combinations. Two eggs can produce the twins as one would be fertilized on its own while the other splits into two, meaning that the threesome comes from one pair of twins and one individual embryo.

The process of conceiving identical triplets comes from when one egg is used for all three, so the one egg splits into two embryos, and then one of those embryos splits again to produce the third child.

triplets get even more slim and range from 1-in-60,000 to

'There was nothing to lead us to believe that this was ever a possibility,' Mrs Stier said.

Their first indication that they were having an unusual pregnancy came when their doctor looked at the ultrasound and made an unexpected face.

'I said "is everything okay?" He said "Yeah, I’m seeing three heartbeats,"' Mrs Stier recalled.

'I think my heart stopped,' the West Allis, Wisconsin mom told the local Fox affiliate.

Mrs Stier was taken into the hospital in the beginning of June because one of the three babies appeared to be in distress.

Ten days later, the three girls- Lucy, Hannah and Norah- were born.

Their delivery came two and a half months early and the three babies had a collective body weight of less than 7 pounds.

'That’s a gift in itself, and to be born on Father’s Day, too— that’s a little extra,' Kevin Stier told Fox6Now.

The Stiers are using relative size and slight differences in haircolor to tell the girls apart.

'They’ve
been so fun and we love seeing them grow and where they are now from 
where they started, it’s such a miracle that everybody is happy,' Mrs 
Stier said.

Chances of naturally conceiving triplets is 1-in-8,000 while chances of identical triplets range from 1-in-60,000 to 1-in-1,000,000 or 1-in-2,000,000
