A rare European butterfly called the continental swallowtail (pictured) has succeeded in breeding in Britain for the first time

A rare European butterfly has succeeded in breeding in Britain for the first time.

The continental swallowtail - a large yellow and black butterfly with a long streamer-shaped tail - has been spotted 12 times in Sussex in recent days.

The butterfly is thought to have migrated from France during last summer’s heatwave, when it was seen several times along the south coast.

But wildlife experts are amazed the insect has managed to survive the winter, and even breed and produce young.

Michael Blencowe, of the Butterfly Conservation charity’s Sussex Branch, has been monitoring the butterflies since they arrived last summer.

He said: ‘So far there have been 12 sightings of swallowtails in Sussex this spring.

‘Six of these have been seen to emerge from pupae we were monitoring, others have been seen in Peacehaven, Chichester, Chanctonbury Ring and Horsham.

‘There are still more to emerge and no doubt many other swallowtails that we don’t know about are roaming the country, so there has never been a more exciting to me to head out looking for butterflies.

‘This current invasion could be the start of the colonisation of Southern England by the swallowtail. In 20 years this butterfly could be a regular visitor to our gardens.’

The UK boasts its own subspecies of swallowtail - Papilio machaon britannicus (pictured as a caterpillar) - which is Britain's largest native species but is smaller and darker than the continental butterfly

The continental swallowtail, which has a 
wingspan of up to three and a half inches (9cm), is common across the warmer 
parts of Europe, but previously it was considered unable to survive 
Britain’s cold winters.

Last summer’s sightings were the first in the UK since 1945. The hot weather, followed by an unusually mild winter and spring, may have provided the conditions suitable for breeding.

The UK boasts its own subspecies of swallowtail - Papilio machaon britannicus - which is Britain’s largest 
native species, but is smaller and darker than the continental butterfly.

It only lives in the Norfolk Broads, where it feeds on milk parsley alone, a plant that is confined to the fenlands.

Its continental cousin - Papilio machaon gorganus - is less fussy and can feed on related umbellifer plants, such as fennel, cow parsley, hogweed and the leaves of carrots.

The emergence of the swallowtail is a welcome boost for butterfly conservationists, after a steady decline in the number of British butterflies.

The loss of wildflower meadows, use of chemicals in farming and the growth of cities has meant the insects have struggled to survive.

A string of damp and cool summers have also hit butterfly populations, which thrive in sunny and warm conditions.

Last year’s hot weather was excellent for butterflies, with numbers up significantly compared to the washout summer of 2012, according to the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme.

But despite the 2013 population boost, numbers last year were still only half of the population seen when the scheme started in 1976.

Butterfly Conservation has asked that anyone who spots swallowtails in Southern England send details to www.sussex-butterflies.org.uk.

Gritting the roads with salt increases wing power in butterflies and boosts their brain size, according to a study released earlier this week.

Research by Minnesota University found male insects that fed on plants rich in sodium that had run off from nearby roads had bigger muscles - while the females had larger eyes.

Scientists claim that this suggests humans are having a previously unknown effect on wildlife.

Butterflies do not eat but suck up fluids containing nectar and other nutrients. They are particularly fond of salt, which is why they often land on people to feast on their sweat.

Now, researchers have found salt run-off from roads - such as when it is used to clear snow - altered development of their brain and flight muscles.

They compared levels of sodium in grass, mustard, oak and milkweed growing in ditches within 16 feet  (five metres) of a county road, and in prairies at least 330 feet (100 metres) from a paved road in a nature reserve near Minneapolis.

The roadside milkweed and oak had 1.5 to 30 times higher concentrations of sodium in its leaves, compared with those further away.

When monarch butterflies (pictured above) were reared on roadside milkweed containing 16 times more salt, males had an increased amount of thoracic protein - an indicator for wing power that is crucial to the insects’ migration.

Female monarchs had larger eyes relative to those reared on prairie milkweed, while cabbage white butterflies raised on an artificial diet with medium (3,000 parts per million) or low (400 parts per million) sodium levels showed developmental differences.

Males on the medium sodium diet had greater thoracic protein, whereas females had greater brain volume.
