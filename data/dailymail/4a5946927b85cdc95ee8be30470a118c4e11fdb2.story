Jellyfish stung at least 400 Florida beachgoers over the weekend, prompting lifeguards to raise purple flags warning of hazardous marine life off the state's east coast, authorities said on Monday.

Officers said the jellyfish swarm arrived on Friday and has remained concentrated around New Smyrna Beach, on the Atlantic coast in the north-central part of the state.

Tropical Storm Cristobal, a potential hurricane headed towards the US after wreaking havoc in the Caribbean, is believed to have pushed the jellyfish closer to shore, according to My Fox Tampa Bay.

'It could be thousands,' said Volusia County Beach Safety Captain Tammy Marris.

'Thousands': Volusia County Beach Patrol officials believe the swarms of jellyfish were forced closer to shore by winds from the storms in the tropics

Proceed with caution: Lifeguards put up purple flags to warn swimmers of what was in the water, causing many to get out

Moving fast: By Momday evening Hurricane 
Cristobal had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was 
tracking east at 2 mph (4 kp). This map shows its expected path this week

'It's hard to see them in the water right now. All you can see are the ones on shore.'

No one was seriously injured, Marris said.

Lifeguards treated most of the victims with a splash of vinegar, which quickly halts the burning pain of the sting.

Jellyfish stings can be dangerous or fatal in rare cases in which the victim is severely allergic to the venom.

Marris said the size of the swarm and number of people stung are not unusual, adding that it is hard for beachgoers to predict when the jellyfish will wash towards shore.

'They're at the mercy of the wind and the current,' she said.

Jellyfish are gelatinous, umbrella-shaped animals with long, trailing tentacles that release venomous stingers on contact with skin or prey.

They can appear in various colors but typically surface with a translucent milky color on central Florida beaches.

High winds: Twenty five mph winds from the Northeast and rough surf hit the Jacksonville Beach in Florida on Monday as a result of Tropical Storm Cristobal traveling up the coast

Local lifeguards stock vinegar, which can deactivate the stingers, as can salt water. Fresh or tap water can reactivate them.

Stung beachgoers can also find relief by submerging their wounds in hot water.

A storm front on Monday churned up the surf, which was calm over the weekend, but so far has not washed the jellyfish out to sea, officials said.

Officials expect conditions to become rougher as Tropical Storm Cristobal passes offshore, east of Florida, and tracks north along the Atlantic.
