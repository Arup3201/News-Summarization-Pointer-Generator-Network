Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Vincent Laforet ascended 10,800 feet in a helicopter to capture these breathtaking images high above Sin City.

The project, entitled AIR: Sin City 10.8K is a follow up to the series, which he released in January, that showed New York City's lights from the sky.

According to Laforet, the attraction for people to see such aerial shots stems from the fact that these types of photographs allow them to see something they 'haven't really seen before.'

Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, Vincent Laforet, recently ascended 10,800 feet to shoot the Las Vegas skyline from the air

Sitting in a helicopter, with his feet dangling out the open door, Laforet snapped stunning photographs of the Strip from above

The project, entitled AIR: Sin City 10.8K is a follow-up to his New York City photo series, which showed the Big Apple from staggering heights

In fact, Laforet believes that 'no photographer has ever shot a city from this height at night.'

Speaking to Mashable, he said: 'From that high, this one little strip of like, Eiffel Towers, it looks like a Monopoly board.'

'It looks like a toy set. It's a little strip of like, 20 or 40 hotels, you know? It's a joke. 

'When you're flying up there, you're flying into space, there is nothing, its pure black. And there's this one, shining expanse of a grid. Its the closest thing I've ever seen to an actual computer chip.'

Because Las Vegas is surrounded by desert, with obviously have no lights, it looks as though the city is its 'very own planet' from above

Similar to how a large expanse of ocean looks from the air, the photographs abruptly turn to black when the desert comes into view

Laforet compares the multi-coloured city lights, which appear as though they are part of a grid, to that of a computer chip

Laforet says that the tiny little Eiffel Towers, hotels, and ferris wheels remind him of a Monopoly board when shot from such high elevation

Laforet was also sure to capture a variety of behind the scenes photographs, such as this one, as he sits at the edge of the aircraft

The entire ascent took about 45 minutes to reach the high altitude and Laforet travelled with his assistant and, of course, a qualified pilot

Next up for Laforet? He hopes to continue his series of cities from above and photograph Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong and London in the future

Aside from the high-altitude shots, Laforet has also included several behind the scenes images, chronicling his journey.

The entire ascent took about 45 minutes and once the aircraft reached almost 11,000 feet, Laforet opened the door of the helicopter to hang his legs out while snapping away.

And there's no stopping Laforet. For his next photo series, he hopes to shoot in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong and London, to name a few.

He also plans to announce when he will be travelling to new places to encourage other people to contribute their own aerial photos, adding a collaborative element to the project.
