Australian supermodel Robyn Lawley has accused the modelling industry of promoting starvation, calling the pressure to be thin 'messed up'.

In an interview with Marie Claire, the 25-year-old beauty revealed the struggle to maintain her weight and the high expectations of the culture of fashion.

At 188cm, Lawley was introduced to the modelling world early on, pushed into auditioning for an agency by one of her three sisters. 

'When I became a teenager... everyone started suggesting it because I was tall and that's what tall girls do, I suppose,' she said.

'When you first consider the idea of modeling, you automatically think you have to be really skinny,' she said.

In an interview with Marie Claire, the 25-year-old beauty revealed the struggle to maintain her weight and the high expectations of the culture of fashion.

Australian supermodel Robyn Lawley has accused the modelling industry of promoting starvation, calling the pressure to be thin 'messed up'.

At 188cm, Lawley was introduced to the modelling world early on, pushed into auditioning for an agency by one of her three sisters.

'When I became a teenager... everyone started suggesting it because I was tall and that's what tall girls do, I suppose,' Lawley said 

'I was really into fashion, so I knew models were about half the size I was. When I went to see the agencies, my weight was always an issue so I took it upon myself to start losing it.

After a few years, the size 12 model began to realise the detrimental effect the industry standards were having on not only her, but her friends. 

'I had a moment when I was about 16, one of my Russian model friends was painfully thin and we went to a cafe after a casting. I was trying not to eat at the time, but I was really struggling,' Lawley said.

'I just got a salad [but] she didn't eat anything. I thought it was just so messed up. I was worried about her health.'

Unwilling to compromise her health, Lawley quit the industry. It took her many years to realise she could model without harming her physical or emotional health. 

'I just see no reason in any labels really, I just want women [to be] happy with their bodies,' Lawley said

Unwilling to compromise her health, Lawley quit the industry. It took her many years to realise she could model without harming her physical or emotional health.

'It was really hard to have that extra pressure to lose, not just a little amount of weight, but a lot. I had a lot of issues with it,' she said.

'[Many models] get measured when they go into an agency, and if they gain weight, they are out. People don't understand what starvation can do to you, it wreaks havoc with your brain.'

Lawley was the first 'plus size' model for Ralph Lauren, but isn't comfortable with the term, and is passionate about promoting healthy body image among young women. 

'I can see the ramifications on young women if their body is similar or larger than mine and they see a 'plus size' label,’ she recently told Daily Mail Australia.

Lawley was signed last year to brand Mango to front their plus-size range Violetta, but is irritated that the modelling industry labels her and other 'plus sizers' as niche.

'People say, "How is she a plus-size model?" and I'm like, "Exactly, this is the point, how am I a plus-size model?', Lawley told Clique Magazine.

'There's no size diversity - just none. So there's a whole no-man's land of models who are in between the 'straight size' and the 'plus-size' and they are not working, yet they've got these amazing bodies that are completely in proportion.' 

'I don't think anyone should be called plus-size,' she adds. 'I think it's derogatory to anyone - it's a label.

'I'm a model; I don't think I need 'plus-size' in front of it.'
