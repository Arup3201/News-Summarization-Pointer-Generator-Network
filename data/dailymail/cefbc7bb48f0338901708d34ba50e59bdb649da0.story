Defiant: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is headed for a clash with the EU and the IMF

The European Union has stepped up pressure on Hungary over the country's refusal to implement austerity policies and threatened legal action over its new constitution.

The warnings escalated the standoff between Budapest and the EU, as Hungary negotiates fresh financial aid from Europe and the International Monetary Fund.

Over the past months, the country's credit rating has been cut to junk by all three major rating agencies, unemployment is 10.6 percent and the country may be facing a recession.

But bailout negotiations broke down after Budapest refused to cut public spending and implemented a new constitution reasserting political control over its central bank.

The EU fears the new constitution hurts the independence of the country's judges, its central bank and its data protection agency.

Some civil rights groups and the European Parliament have warned that the former Soviet-bloc nation of 10million, which led the fight against communism with its 1956 revolution, risks losing its democratic footing.

EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn today also blasted Hungary's fiscal policies - which rely on unorthodox one-time measures instead of fiscal austerity.

Hungary ran a surplus in 2011 and its deficit is expected to remain below the 3 percent of economic output allowed under EU rules.

But Mr Rehn said that had Budapest not nationalised private pension funds to buffer state coffers, its deficit would have been 6 per cent of Gross Domestic Product last year.

He warned the EU could withhold valuable development funds if the Hungarian government continues to resist taking new cost-cutting measures.

A spokesman for the European 
Commission, Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen, said the Commission, which is 
analysing whether Hungary's new laws violate the EU treaty, remained 
concerned and would not shy away from using all its powers to fight any 
violations.

'A legally stable environment, based on the rule of law, including respect for media freedom, democratic principles and fundamental rights, is also the best guarantee for citizens' trust and confidence of partners and investors,' she said.

'This is particularly vital in times of economic crisis.'

In a statement, the Hungarian government said it was 'committed to universal European values' and was 'ready for negotiations and to find solutions' with the Commission about any of its concerns.

The new constitution came into force just weeks after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government requested financial aid from the EU and the IMF.

The two institutions broke off preliminary talks on the rescue package in December, after voicing fears that the new laws compromised the independence of Hungary's central bank.

EU treaties demand that central banks remain independent. Discussions between Hungary and the IMF resumed Wednesday in Washington.

Hungary's deficit has been criticised by the EU since the central European nation joined the 27-member bloc in 2004.

But its economy has been staggering since 2008, when the global credit crunch forced Hungary to accept an IMF bailout of €20billion (£16.5billion).

The European Commission said Hungary has taken 'no effective action' to limit its deficit, making the country's finances unsustainable in the long run.

The Hungarian currency, the forint, hit a record above 324 per euro last week.

On Wednesday, the forint was trading at 312 to the euro, while the interest rate for Hungary's 10-year forint bond was near 9.5 per cent, an unsustainable burden.

Three EU nations - Greece, Portugal and Ireland - had to seek international bailouts after their interest rates rose above 7 per cent.
