Two former British Army soldiers who have travelled to Syria to fight against Islamic State insist they are not mercenaries but involved in a war of ‘good against evil’.

James Hughes, 26, and Jamie Read, 24, are helping Kurdish peshmerga defend the embattled city of Kobani from the brutal terror group, whose ranks reportedly include 2,000 British Muslim recruits.

Photographs posted on Facebook show the pair on the Syrian frontline dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles, posing in bullet-scarred buildings.

On the website of the security firm they founded, Mr Hughes and Mr Read said they were motivated by ‘conscience’, not money, to travel to the warzone ‘to assist innocent people in the face of terror from IS’.

Insisting they were volunteer fighters, not guns for hire, the ex-servicemen said they would ‘not do nothing while innocent men, women and children are tortured and murdered by Islamic State while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill’.

They add: ‘This is not a religious war nor is it a racial war, this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity.’

But Mr Read’s mother said yesterday she was not happy that her son had travelled to Syrian Kurdistan – known as Rojava – to fight the Islamist extremists.

Speaking from her family home in Carlisle, Wendy Armiger, 43, said: ‘He’s been in touch to say he’s okay, but I don’t like the fact that he’s gone there. It’s his life, but he’s my son.’ Mr Hughes, from Malvern, Worcestershire, said he had served in the infantry for five years, including three tours of Afghanistan, before leaving earlier this year.

Mr Read, who lives in Newmains, North Lanarkshire, said in an online CV that he had been in the Army for three years, specialising in reconnaissance, before leaving in 2010 to work for private security companies.

In August, the friends set up the Pathfinder Group Terrorism & Conflict Research Center, a security company with the intention of providing ‘specialist intelligence and surveillance services’, and building up detailed information about terror groups. The firm’s motto is: ‘We will go where the rest fear to go’.

On Facebook, Mr Read describes how he had been involved in a fierce clash with IS jihadists.

He wrote that the ‘s*** hit the fan’, prompting Jordan Matson, 28, a US veteran wounded fighting with the Kurds who is understood to have recruited the Britons, to reply: ‘It’s always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head.’

Graham Penrose, a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families, said: ‘They are not being paid. They are not participating for any commercial gain.’

The Met Police are investigating reports that a 17-year-old woman from Haringey, North London, was also making her way to Syria to join the struggle against IS.

She was last seen in Belgium after catching the Eurostar in the UK and would be the first known British female fighting the jihadis.

Iraqi forces say they retook two towns north of Baghdad from Islamic State fighters today, driving them from strongholds they had held for months and clearing a main road from the capital to Iran.

There was no independent confirmation that the army, Shi’ite militia and Kurdish peshmerga forces had completely retaken Jalawla and Saadiya, about 70 miles north-east of Baghdad. Many residents fled the violence long ago.

At least 23 peshmerga and militia fighters were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting, medical and army sources said.

'We have liberated Jalawla and Saadiya,' said Mala Bakhtiar, a senior official in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party, speaking by phone from a nearby town. He estimated 50 Islamic State fighters were killed out of a force of 400.

Iraq’s Shi’ite-led government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back the Islamic State since it swept through mainly Sunni Muslim provinces of northern Iraq in June, meeting virtually no resistance.

Last week the army broke a months-long siege of the country’s largest refinery north of Baghdad, but Islamic State fighters continue to take territory in the western province of Anbar, which shares borders with Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

The militants have been fighting in the last two days to take full control of the Anbar provincial capital Ramadi. On Sunday, Iraqi and foreign jets struck Islamic State fighters near central Ramadi, provincial council member Mahmoud Ahmed Khalaf told Reuters. Clashes continued in the city, he said.

Jalawla and Saadiya are located in Diyala province which is mainly under the control of the Baghdad government forces and Kurdish peshmerga.

Recapturing the towns would help secure the Kurdish-controlled towns of Kalar and Khanaqin to the north as well as nearby dams and oil fields, peshmerga Secretary-General Jabbar Yawar said. It would also allow the road to be reopened between Baghdad and Khanaqin, close to the Iranian border.

While the hardline Sunni Islamic State forces have not advanced into Baghdad, they hold a ring of towns around the mainly Shi’ite capital and have claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in Shi’ite districts of the city.

A car bomb in the Shi’ite town of Yousufiya, 20 miles southeast of Baghdad, killed five people on Sunday, police and medics said. Two other bombs in towns near the capital killed four other people.

They call themselves the Lions Of Rojava and boast, 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.'

They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists.

Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds.

Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight.

Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora.

In August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance.

But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava. Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities.

Last month it was reported that a currently serving British marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave.

The 22-year-old Royal Marine Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups.

Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists.

It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict.

There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance.

Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons.

The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.
