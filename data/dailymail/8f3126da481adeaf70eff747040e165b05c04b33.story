Sony will release its controversial movie 'The Interview in UK cinemas on February 6, it has been announced.

The movie, which features the fictional assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un was initially withdrawn by the film company after it was targeted by hackers in November 2014. 

The attack was blamed on North Korea who were angry about the subject of the comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco.

Sony's top executive Kazuo Hirai, told a press conference in Las Vegas today that his employees had been subjected ot a 'vicious and malicious cyber attack'. 

He added that he was proud that the company was standing against 'the extortionist efforts of criminals'. 

The company was hacked in November by a group calling themselves 'Guardians of the Peace', but they are believed to be a front for North Korean cyber warfare experts. 

Mr Hirai said it 'would be remiss' if he did not address the scandal surrounding the controversial movie.

The main launch of the movie last month was abandoned after theatres were threatened with 9/11-style terrorist attacks if they carried the feature.

Following the major cyber attack, South Korean intelligence sources claimed that the hermit state has a 6,000 member cyber army, which has doubled in size in recent years. 

The United States government believes that North Korea is behind the attack on Sony, however this has been denied by the secretive state. 

South Korean security officials believe that their country has been hit by half-a-dozen cyber attacks by their northern neighbour since 2007.

North Korea has attacked the United State's decision to impose sanctions over the illegal hacking of Sony's computer network. 

An unnamed source in North Korea's foreign ministry said the U.S. was 'groundlessly' stirring up hostility aimed at Pyongyang. 

A report on North Korean state TV said: ''The policy persistently pursued by the US to stifle the DPRK [North Korea], groundlessly stirring up bad blood towards it, would only harden its will and resolution to defend the sovereignty of the country.

'The persistent and unilateral action taken by the White House to slap "sanctions" against the DPRK patently proves that it is still not away from inveterate repugnancy and hostility toward the DPRK. 

North Korea claimed that the sanctions would not weaken the nation's military might.  

The Interview has become Sony's highest grossing online release ever, taking in $15million in online rentals, as well as $2.8million from 331 theatres within 72 hours of opening on Christmas day. 

In one series of leaked emails, the head of Sony Pictures UK Peter Taylor criticised the movie - not for its content - simply due to James Franco's lack of comedy skills. 

According to the email from Mr Taylor: 'The unanimous point of view here is that this (is) another misfire from the pairing.'

He said the movies was 'desperately unfunny and repetitive.'

He added: 'James Franco proves once again that irritation is his strong suit which is a shame because the character could have been appealing and funny out of his hands.'

Taylor and other executives agreed that the first half hour of the film, which features a satirical interview with hip-hop artist Eminem, was amusing but was later overshadowed by 'realistic violence that would be shocking in a horror movie'.
