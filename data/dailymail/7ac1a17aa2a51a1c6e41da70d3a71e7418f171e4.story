A spurned husband who caught his wife in the throes of passion with her colleague in his parked car, drove after them, ramming his love rival's car until it crashed.

Father-of-three Alan Stephens 'lost his head' after catching his partly-naked  wife Gretta with her colleague Philip Davis in his parked car, a court heard.

The stunned couple then drove off in such haste that driver Mr Davis' car seat was still reclined, the judge at Ipswich Crown Court was told yesterday.

Stephens, 48, chased the couple for 
two miles along a country road near Lowestoft, Suffolk, trying to 
overtake them and ramming the back of Mr Davis' car with his.  As he 
drove he beeped his horn and tried to force Mr Davis' car off the road.

Michael
Crimp, prosecuting, said that at one point Stephens made his rival's 
car spin around, before it finally careered off the road after being 
rammed again, hitting trees and bushes before ploughing to a stop.

Mr
Davis lost consciousness before coming round to find Stephens pouring 
vodka over him and punching his arm in sheer fury, Mr Crimp said.

Mr Davis suffered injuries to his 
ribs and bruising and swelling to his arm while Mrs Stephens had cuts on
her elbow and back and bruising.

She told police her husband had rammed Mr Davis' car four or five times.

Andrew
Thompson, defending, said Stephens had gone out looking for his wife.  
He said he knew she was having an affair and feared she was going to 
leave him.

The couple were caught in this car park by Mr Stephens. They drove off at such haste the car seat was reclined

Mr Thompson said Stephens caught her, partially-undressed, in an 'intimate clinch' with Mr Davis.

He said Stephens knew his wife had been having an affair and had feared she was going to leave him.

Mr Thompson said: 'He was in a state of high emotion.  He thought he was losing his family and everything he held dear.'

He said Mr Davis had driven off in fright with his seat still reclined and said Stephens had driven after them with the intention of stopping their car and asking Mr Davis to stay away from his family.

He said Stephens and his wife were back together after she had ended her affair with Mr Davis.

Stephens, of Corton, near Lowestoft, admitted dangerous driving and assaulting Mr Davis by beating.

Sentencing him, Judge John Devaux 
said he had been in a state of high emotion when he found his wife with Mr Davis.

Stephens was given a 26-week jail sentence suspended for 12 months and banned from driving for 18 months.

Stephens was also ordered to pay £300 compensation to Mr Davis and £200 costs.
