North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un visited a cat fish farm as computer engineers struggled to restart the hermit state's internet connection. 

The nation's 1,000 internet connected computers suffered a service outage for ten hours during a suspected cyber attack. 

While the computers were offline, Kim visited the Pyongyang Catfish farm where he provided 'field guidance' to managers at the plant.

Wearing his traditional heavy woolen coat, Kim was surrounded by a group of senior officials, unusually, none of whom were wearing military uniforms, as he looked into a tank containing cat fish.

The United States refused to comment whether they were responsible for the ten-hour shut down. 

The hermit state has been accused of being responsible for last month's highly embarrassing attack on Sony Pictures. 

South Korean officials said the Korean Central News Agency and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, which are both used to disseminate propaganda.  

The outage was probably more inconvenient to foreigners, who can access the Internet through 3G networks, than to North Korean residents, most of whom have never gone online. 

Outside the plant, Kim, pictured centre, gave officials the benefit of his experience following the inspection

The Korean National News Agency website, pictured, was off-line for ten hours earlier today 

The top news item on the website's return was Kim Jong-un's visit to the Pyongyang Catfish plant. 

There are only about 1,000 Internet Protocol addresses in North Korea for a population of 25 million, South Korean analysts say. The privileged are also allowed to view a self-contained domestic Intranet that carries state media propaganda and a limited amount of information pulled and censored from the real Internet.

North Korea did not immediately release a response to the shutdown.

But, a communique on the official North Korean news agency website, which had been off line for ten hours, condemned the United States, comparing it to the Roman Empire, which 'was thrown into a dumping ground of history as it collapsed while seeking prosperity through aggression and war'. 

Internet connections are incredibly rare within North Korea, although more than one million people are believed to have access to a mobile phone. Although the North Korean phone network does not allow subscribers to call abroad or receive foreign phone calls.
