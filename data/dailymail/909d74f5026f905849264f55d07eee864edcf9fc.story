She managed to keep her slimming a secret surprise from her husband, Larry, until he arrived back at his hometown airport in Wilmington, North Carolina.

'I just kept pictures off Facebook, off the internet,' Misty said. 'When I did send him pictures, they were from the shoulder up,' she told WSFA.

The weight was just one of a host of surprises Misty had waiting for him.

Their three year old daughter, Nevhah, had grown in the year he had been gone and perhaps even more significantly Misty had bought the family a new house.

'He’s been wanting to buy a house now forever, and I went and did it while he was gone,' she said.

Secret slimmer: Misty Shaffer only sent her husband pictures above the shoulder so he wouldn't be able to tell how much weight she had lost

The first glimpse Larry Shaffer had of his slimmer spouse was as he turned the corner and walked out of baggage claim at Wilmington, North Carolina airport.

At first, it appeared Shaffer didn't appear to recognise his new-look wife.

A group of familyy and friends held signs and yelled ‘surprise!’

The couple hugged each other tightly as they saw each other for the first time in 12 months.

'Wow,' Shaffer said after seeing his wife. 'This is icing on the cake because I’ve been happy with the way she’s looked since day one but it’s something she wanted to do and she reached her goal,' he said.

He was also surprised to see how much
his little girl had grown in the year he had been gone. He hopes to be 
at home for a while before starting another tour of duty.

'Everything’s
new,' Shaffer said. 'I pretty much have a new wife. My daughter’s three
times the size she was and we have our own home now.'

Final surprise: A new sexy, thin wife, a bigger daughter and a brand new house for Larry Shaffer - life couldn't be better!
