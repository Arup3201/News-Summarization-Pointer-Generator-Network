Men taking the New York subway are being asked to sit more considerately as part of a new campaign to tackle 'manspreading on the city's public transport.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is set to unveil public service advertisements aimed at men who spread their legs and hog an unfair amount of space on packed subway trains.

A poster will read: 'Dude...Stop the Spread, Please', alongside an image of two subway commuters forced to stand because a man is sitting in the typical 'manspread stance - legs splayed into a wide V-shape.

The campaign, which will carry the slogan, 'Courtesy Counts: Manners Make a Better Ride', is also targeting other subway users, such as those whose bulky backpacks get in the way of other riders.

The new adverts come as more customers are crowding onto New York underground trains than at any other time in recent history.

As many as 6.1 million riders were logged to have used the Subway on a single day in 2014, up from just under 5.1 million customers on the busiest day a decade ago. 

'Manspreading' has become a hotly debated topic for subway riders, who go so far as to post photographs of the worst culprits on Twitter or even confront them on video.

Last week, a reporter for The Gothamist set out to confront 'manspreaders' on the New York City subway and did not have trouble finding interviewees.

She asked each man  if they think their own 'leg splay' is appropriate given the people around them. Many insist this is not normal behavior.

One commuter explains that his splay is to accommodate a bag, while another says that he is exhausted. And one defiant passenger insists all men biologically require ample space.

Each man had their own ideas about when it was and wasn't appropriate to 'manspread' on the Subway

They are then asked to measure with a tape the appropriate amount of space allotted for a considerate 'manspread'. Here the results differ - from six inches to 18.

The author of the report acknowledged that the MTA is about to launch a campaign to raise awareness about the issue, but added that 'we still have a long way to go. 

'The next time you get on the train, look down at your own knees - how far apart are they? If there's space enough for a litter of puppies or a celebrity selfie group shot, you are taking up too much space. Pull it in. Don't make us find you.'

Some insisted nobody around them appeared 'squished' when they spread their legs into a wide V-shape
