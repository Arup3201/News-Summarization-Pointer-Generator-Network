When the most decorated Argentinian footballer in history makes a beeline for you to praise your side’s performance, you are generally on to a good thing.

Ronald Koeman was delighted to be congratulated by Esteban Cambiasso after Southampton extended their best ever start to a top-flight season by inflicting another defeat on struggling Leicester.

‘Cambiasso came to me after the game and said, “What a good team you have”. That’s a big compliment from a great player and it’s very important,’ said Koeman.

It is not just internationals with 23 titles impressed by Southampton. There is a dizzy whirl of people hankering to heap success on Saints and for good reason. Not only are they second in the table, just four points behind Chelsea, but they again extended the best defensive record in the top four.

The stakes have been raised at Southampton. That much was clear as groans became louder and more guttural as the home side dominated Leicester but failed to find a breakthrough for more than an hour.

It required substitute Shane Long to break the deadlock with his debut League goals for the club. The Ireland striker came off the bench after 68 largely uninspiring minutes and nabbed his first seven minutes later, before sealing all three points on 80 minutes.

‘We had to be patient,’ said Koeman, ‘It was difficult against a team with good organisation in defence and we lacked attention in the box and a final pass in the first half. But I said at half time, “Keep pressing and we will create, for sure we will score one or two times”.’

He was full of praise for Long, who had been dropped to make way for Sadio Mane after starting last week’s victory at his former club Hull. ‘It was great coming in from Shane, he made all the difference. Sometimes Shane is not happy [when he does not start], sometimes Sadio is not, but I like that in a player. Shane was brilliant today.’

Long made the breakthrough shortly after his introduction. Fellow substitute Jack Cork played in an arcing cross which was controlled by Graziano Pelle, who set up Long to expertly curl past Kasper Schmeichel into the far corner.

Four minutes later the £12million signing, who has had a frustrating start to professional life on the south coast, added a second, finishing supremely after going one-on-one with Schmeichel.

Koeman looked drenched but delighted at the final whistle, flinging off the red blanket he had draped over his knees in an attempt to keep warm. It appears he might be building something truly special at St Mary’s and more importantly, something that lasts.

This was the week Southampton opened a £33m centre of excellence, named the Markus Liebherr Pavilion after the late Swiss businessman who bought Saints out of administration in 2009.

The new training centre houses the ‘black box’, a room where matches from around the world are played exhaustively on a giant video screen. Sympathies have to be with the person forced to watch the first half of yesterday’s game again. As the rain lashed down, Southampton managed only one attempt on target in the opening 45 minutes, which was one better than the visitors.

That effort came in the 21st minute and it was an ambitious one. Nathaniel Clyne responded to the crowd urging and unleashed a shot from 25 yards, but Kasper Schmeichel collected easily.

Moments later, Leicester’s Jeff Schlupp did well to head behind after a brilliant Ryan Bertrand cross. While the Foxes remained steadfast they offered little going forward. A Wes Morgan header from a corner, which he directed high and wide, was their first real chance on 25 minutes.

The second half heralded a more fluid Southampton. Pelle fired over on 49 minutes from a Tadic cross after he linked up with Mane superbly. The crowd were cheering when 22-year-old Mane finished from close range shortly after but he was rightly ruled offside, guilty of mistiming his run.

Long popped up with his two and Leicester’s Chris Wood was heavily mocked by the crowd after missing a plum opportunity for a consolation goal, prodding the ball to the right of the target when one-on-one with Fraser Forster. Long almost got his hat-trick with the final touch of the game but hit the side netting — not that he will be too bothered about that.

Leicester have now failed to score in their last five games and have collected just one point since their 5-3 win over Manchester United.

‘It’s a tough run for our players to deal with at the moment. It tests the resolve of everybody,’ said manager Nigel Pearson. ‘You’ve got to try to separate the psychological aspect of the players from how we play. Unfortunately we didn’t show enough quality.

‘I don’t accept the argument that it’s a great achievement to be here and that’s it. The combination of not keeping clean sheets and not scoring goals makes it very difficult.’
