Chris Tarrant was rushed to hospital last night after being taken ill on a flight returning from Thailand.

The former Who Wants To Be A Millionaire presenter,  67, told cabin crew aboard the flight from Bangkok that he would need an ambulance immediately upon arriving at Heathrow.

He was taken from the tarmac to Charing Cross Hospital in Central London, where he was seen by emergency doctors.

His manager Paul Vaughan said he had spoken to the star in hospital, who sounded ‘very tired’.

Mr Vaughan said he believed the episode was an asthma attack.

‘I’ve been his manager for 30 years, and I know that if he goes down like a ton of bricks it’s usually asthma,’ he added.

Tarrant had been in Burma filming a new Channel 5 travel series.

Mr Vaughan said: ‘I’m surmising, but I think his asthma attack might have been triggered by a night-time stopover in Bangkok, which has very poor air quality.’

A London Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed that one of its crews had taken a man from Heathrow to hospital ‘as a priority’.
