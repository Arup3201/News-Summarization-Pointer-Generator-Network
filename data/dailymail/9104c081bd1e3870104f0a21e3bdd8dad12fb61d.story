A man brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend just weeks after he was reunited with her via Facebook after 15 years apart.

David Hoyle, 39, attacked Rebecca Bamber, 42, with three broken wine bottles before stabbing her repeatedly at her home in Widnes, Cheshire, as she tried to escape.

As Ms Bamber collapsed in her garden, Hoyle fled and was eventually stopped by police on the M56 motorway.

Jailed: David Hoyle, 39, brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend Rebecca Bamber, 42, just weeks after he was reunited with her via Facebook after 15 years apart

Today he was jailed for life at Chester Crown Court and ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars after a jury convicted him of murdering the mother-of-one.

Hoyle, from Bradford, West Yorkshire had previously been in a relationship with Ms Bamber, but had lost touch with her until the pair began chatting on the social network in May.

They had met on a number of occasions in both Bradford and Cheshire but the night before mother-of-one Ms Bamber died is believed to have been the first time that Hoyle had visited her home.

Hoyle stayed the night on June 7 but the following morning a neighbour was in his garden when he heard a woman screaming and the sound of a broken glass.

The neighbour then saw Ms Bamber at the downstairs front window of her home, covered in blood and mouthing the words 'phone the police'.

Hoyle had attacked her with three wine bottles in a bedroom causing wounds so severe that they fractured her skull.

He went on to repeatedly stab her as she made a desperate attempt to escape and she eventually made it into her garden, still pursued by Hoyle, where she collapsed.

Hoyle fled the scene in a van and rammed a number of police vehicles before he was stopped and arrested on the M56 motorway.

Police were able to track him after Ms Bamber’s neighbour noted the registration number and details of the van.

Ms Bamber died at Whiston Hospital from her injuries. 

Following sentence, Detective Inspector Helen Spooner, of Cheshire Constabulary, said: 'Hoyle’s attack was brutal, sustained and shocking - the level of violence used was extreme and the injuries sustained by Rebecca were devastating. She had clearly tried to desperately fight off her attacker but was overpowered by him.

'We will probably never know the real reason behind Hoyle’s actions that day. Only he knows why he subjected Rebecca to such a brutal attack in her own home.

'Hoyle has shown no remorse for what he did five months ago and I can only hope that his time behind bars will allow him to reflect upon what he has done and the consequences of that, both to Rebecca and all those who loved her and knew her.

'My thoughts remain with Rebecca’s family and friends who have been deeply affected by what happened that day. I hope that the successful conclusion of this case will allow them to find some sort of closure although I know they are still trying to come to terms with what has happened.

She added: 'This was a particularly difficult case for all involved and I would like to thank every single person who assisted with the investigation. In particular I would like to thank Rebecca’s neighbour who came to her aid that day and did all he could to help her b‘ and ensure Hoyle was caught.

'His actions were truly remarkable and I cannot thank him enough. I know that what happened that day has affected him deeply and I only hope that the conclusion of this case allows him to move forward with his life.'

In a statement, Ms Bamber’s family said: 'Even after the lengthy period of time, we still find it difficult to believe that Rebecca has been taken from us in such a cruel and violent way. Not only has a mother been taken, but a sister and daughter too. It is difficult for us all to come to terms with what actually happened but, as a family, we hope that the conclusion of this court case will allow us some closure as we try to rebuild our lives and move forward.'

Richard Riley, Senior Crown Prosecutor with Mersey-Cheshire Crown Prosecution Service, said Ms Bamber had been stabbed a total of 11 times.

'Hoyle subjected Ms Bamber to a brutal and sustained attack and clearly intended to do her really serious harm,' he said.

'Hoyle’s claim that he hadn’t meant to kill her was ridiculous. She’d been stabbed 11 times with two different knives and three broken bottles.

'The jury dismissed these claims and has found Hoyle guilty of murder.

'I would like to thank Ms Bamber’s neighbour for the courage he showed throughout this dreadful incident. His 999 call was the key to putting a very dangerous man behind bars.'
