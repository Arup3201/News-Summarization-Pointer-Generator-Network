Nigel Pearson has vowed Leicester will not 'lie down' at Manchester City as they battle for survival.

The Foxes head to the Etihad on Wednesday bottom of the Barclays Premier League and four points from safety.

City have won just two of their last seven top flight games as they battle Chelsea for the title and lost 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday.

Leicester manager Pearson insisted Manuel Pellegrini's men still carry the same threat to his side but believes the Foxes are ready for the fight.

He said: 'They are a very talented squad and there's always going to be scrutiny. People have told me they are in a bit of a sticky spell, a sticky spell for them isn't one for us.

'Success is relative, they have two players to each position and have quality there, whatever side they put up against you will have quality.

'But they will be aware we have some dangerous players, what we have to do is show weren't not just a capable side but one which isn't going to go anywhere and lie down.'

Kasper Schmeichel is out with a broken foot but is expected to return this month after being sidelined since December.

Pearson has a fully fit squad otherwise as they battle the drop having won just two of their last 21 league games.

The manager has been pleased with their level of performance though and they almost snatched a win at Everton last time out before conceding a late Matt Upson own goal to draw 2-2.

And Pearson insisted Leicester still hold belief they can survive this season.

'We have been bottom since November and the players have put in some really good performances. That's a show of resilience in itself,' he said.

'As the season wears on the pressure builds, you can't get away from that. My job is to keep the players freed up in their minds so they can go and play. I do believe there is a lot of belief in the dressing room that we can turn the situation around.

'As I have already pointed out the players playing as well as they can is the acid test, my job as manager is to allow them to do that.

'We have belief in ourselves and time will tell. There aren't any easy games but we have to show we have plenty of character and quite a bit of ability, what we have to do is transfer it into points.'
