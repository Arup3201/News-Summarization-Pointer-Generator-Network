Charged: Alicia D Brown was arrested for child abuse after her little girl was found alone in a car

A Maryland mother who left her four-year-old child in a casino parking lot for eight hours has been charged with child abuse.

Alicia D Brown was spotted on security camera footage arriving in the parking garage at 10am on December 1.

Security guards found the little girl after hearing her crying at about 6.30pm.

She was alone in the car, which had blankets taped up around the windows.

As police prepared to remove the child, who was cold and hungry, the mother returned and was arrested.

She had been seen entering the casino area on cameras shortly after parking her car on the fourth level of the garage.

Temperatures were close to freezing on Tuesday but apart from being cold, the child appeared to be healthy and there were no signs of physical abuse.

The girl was taken to a medical center for a check up after being found in a state of distress.

Brown was not working at the casino, but it was unclear if she had returned to check on the child during the day, according to the Baltimore Sun.

The 24-year-old, from Baltimore, has been charged with child abuse, confining an unattended child and neglect of a minor.

She was being held on a $150,000 bond and her daughter has been handed over to a relative.

Police spokesman Lieutenant TJ Smith told WBalTV: 'I don't care if they had that whole car set up like a day care center. That child should not be left alone in a car by herself.'

He added: '[This is] parental selfishness, absolute stupidity, just a reckless, reckless abandonment.'

Casino president Rob Norton told News4: 'Incidents of parental neglect and lack 
of personal responsibility are disturbing.'

He added: 'We are thankful that our 
security team was able to intervene and get the appropriate authorities 
involved and that we found the child unharmed.'
