A portrait of Cherie Blair had to be corrected after the artist accidentally painted her eyes the wrong colour.

The painting, which forms part of Adam Birtwistle's retrospective at Kings Place, London, went through the emergency correction after Mrs Blair spotted the mistake.

Mr Birtwistle sent Mrs Blair a photo of the finished work after she sat for the portrait in 2011, but she sent a note back asking 'what colour are my eyes?'

Guess who: This portrait of Cherie Blair needed to undergo an emergency correction after artist Adam Birtwistle got the colour of her eyes wrong

To his shock, the artist realised he had painted her dark brown eyes a shade of deep blue, the London Evening Standard has reported.

He had to jump on a train to London to make the correction after the error had been spotted, which the artist said took all of five seconds to fix.

Mr Birtwistle said: 'As always with people like that, they don’t have much time.

'She was sitting for me for less than an hour and most of it she had her
head in her iPad.

'I had to keep telling her to sit up and look 
natural.'

And in real life: Mrs Blair, pictured giving a speech with noticeably brown eyes, was uninterested in buying the artwork even after the correction had been made

Mr Birtwistle, son of composer Sir Harrison Birtwistle, is an acclaimed artist whose former subjects include David Hockney and Elvis Costello.

Even with the change made however the artist still could not get Mrs Blair to buy the painting.

Mr Birtwistle said: 'She had it hanging up in her house for two weeks, after which my gallerist messaged her to see if she’d be keen on buying it.'

Acclaimed artist Adam Birtwistle, whose former subjects include David Hockney and Elvis Costello, painted the portrait of Cherie Blair in 2011

But Mrs Blair is reported as saying: 'No thank you. Interesting painting but I’m not in the mood for buying art.'

It is not the first time Mrs Blair has posed for a portrait.

She
was painted in nude by her friend Euan Uglow when she was only 22. It 
was most recently shown at the Browse & Darby gallery in Mayfair, 
with a price tag of £600,000.

At
the time it was rumoured that she and her husband bought a sketch that 
was being exhibited alongside the painting, and which cost £4,000.

Since Mr Blair stepped down as Prime Minster, Mrs Blair has used the 
prominence she gained as his wife to raise both funds and awareness for a
wide range of charities at home and overseas.

Among
others, she is patron of Breast Cancer Care, Refuge, Scope and the 
Community Foundation for Merseyside, honorary vice-president - and 
formerly president - of Barnados, and president of the Loomba 
Foundation, which campaigns to alleviate the plight of widows around the
world.

In 2008, she 
founded the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, which runs programmes in 
many parts of the developing world, including Africa, India and the 
Middle East, to help women set up and expand businesses, in order to 
gain financial independence.

She
was appointed vice-chair of the International Council on Women's 
Business Leadership in 2011 by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 
advising the US government on how its foreign policy can support women's
economic empowerment around the world.
