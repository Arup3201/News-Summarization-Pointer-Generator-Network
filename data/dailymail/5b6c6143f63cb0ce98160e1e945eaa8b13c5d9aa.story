England women's captain Steph Houghton says there will be nothing especially friendly about the national team's technically non-competitive clash with Germany at Wembley next month.

With both sides going through their qualifiers for the 2015 World Cup in Canada undefeated, England and two-time World Cup winners Germany are eager to get one over on their European rival on November 23.

'We have a World Cup to prepare for next year, against world-class opposition in Germany,' says Houghton. 'We are taking it very seriously.

'Even though we are trying to attract as many people as we can, it is all about how we perform on the day and how we test ourselves against one of the best.'

Germany went through their 10 group games with an astronomical goal difference of plus-58 to England's plus-51. But while not as prolific in front of goal, Mark Sampson's Three Lions women conceded just once and were never in danger of defeat before finishing off their campaign with a 10-0 thrashing of Montenegro. 

Germany leaked four in total and needed an injury time winner to claim a 3-2 victory over Republic of Ireland, a major scare for the team who have won the last six European Championships.

'We want to be part of big games, and it doesn't get much bigger than England v Germany at Wembley,' says Houghton.

'We want to take our confidence that we have from the last 10 qualifying games, our perfect record, our great win against Sweden (who also went through their qualifying group with 10 wins) in a friendly, into this game with Germany.'

'It is important that we play against the best teams in the world. We want to create a buzz before the World Cup. We want to play at Wembley, play the best we can, try and get people on our side, so that when do go to Canada for the World Cup we have the full support of the country back home.'

While the Germany clash will be a first for an England women's side at Wembley, Houghton has fond memories of her appearance there at the Olympics for Great Britain against Brazil where the second-minute goal from the defender turned out to be the winner in front of 70,584 fans.

The Games were a turning point for women's football, says Houghton, and with a nail-biting end to the Women's Super League season this weekend just gone - with Houghton's Manchester City beating Chelsea to deny the Blues the title and Liverpool winning their game to retain the trophy - the time is ripe to impress again.

'The Brazil game atmosphere was something that has never been heard of in women’s football - that was a massive time when we were able to change people’s perception,' says Houghton.

'It was the Olympics as a whole. Everybody wanted to see any event that was connected with the Olympics, any Great Britain team. We were lucky that we managed to get 70,000. It was an opportunity to go and see Wembley Stadium, like our game against Germany in November, and an opportunity to watch an English team.'

The last time England and Germany women's side met was in the 2009 Euros final, with the Germans winning 6-2. 

The heavy grass of Wembley will be about as far removed from the controversial artificial surfaces that await Houghton's side in Canada from June 6, 2015.  

An outcry against the planned use of non-turf pitches in Canada is at such a level more than 50 leading players have joined to file a law suit against the Canadian Soccer Association and FIFA at the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal on the basis of gender discrimination. 

But while players from the USA, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea and Spain have backed the protest, no England players have joined. 

'As a footballer I grew up playing on grass, so of course I want to be playing on what the men play on,' says Houghton. 'But we can't do anything about it now. We are just fully focused on preparing whatever pitch it is, and go and do our country proud. 

'Before the last game against Montenegro, we trained every session on the 3G pitches indoors. A lot of players at clubs play on that surface anyway so it is not if it is anything new to anyone.'
