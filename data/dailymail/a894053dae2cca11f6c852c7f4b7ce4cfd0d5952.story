Queen of Shops star Mary Portas revealed last night that the genetic father of her young son is in fact her brother.

Miss Portas and her civil partner Melanie Rickey had previously kept their sperm donor's identity anonymous.

Miss Rickey, 42, gave birth to the couple's first child in 2012 following IVF treatment. They had desperately wanted Miss Portas, 54, to also have a genetic link to their child.

Miss Portas revealed the extraordinary circumstances behind the birth of her son Horatio in a newspaper interview to promote her memoir, Shop Girl.

She revealed that she had asked for help from her younger brother, Lawrence Newton, who said he would be 'honoured' to assist. Miss Rickey subequently became pregnant on her second round of IVF.

Miss Portas said she informed Mr Newton of Horatio's birth via text.

The couple's son, now two, calls Miss Portas 'Mama' and Miss Rickey 'Mummy'. Mr Newton is referred to as 'Daddy'.

Miss Portas told The Times of Horatio's birth: 'Lawrence was the first one there [with us] and he picked him up and it was just very emotional. He and I walked out into the sunshine holding him. I remember we were round the back of the hospital and I said to him 'thank you!' and he said, 'It's my pleasure', and we just held each other.

'That was it, you know? It's amazing. And now, when I look at Horatio, he is a complete mix of [Mel] and me.'

She added: 'Of course, now I know that it could only ever have been Lawrence who was Horatio's father.'

Miss Portas – who had only told close family and friends about Horatio's genetic father – is one of a growing number of women in same-sex relationships who have asked siblings to assist with fertility treatments.

The star of Mary Queen of Shops said of Horatio: 'He is extraordinarily charming, so full of life. He's slept since he was five months old.

He loves kicking a ball, he loves puzzles, music – I think because there is so much joy and easiness around him. We are all calmer … but we still get that thing at 6.30am when he shouts out 'Mama! Mama!'.'

Mr Newton, 52, who has no wish for a family of his own, is living with his sister, her partner and their son for three months before he emigrates to Bermuda to be with his girlfriend.

Miss Portas has two elder children – Mylo, 21, and Verity, 18 – with her ex-husband Graham Portas, a chemical engineer.

The couple split in 2003 before Miss Portas met Miss Rickey at a dinner held at the Royal College of Art. The couple entered into a civil partnership in 2010.

Miss Portas started out in 1989 as a shop window-dresser at London department store Harvey Nicholls, rising to become creative designer with a seat on the board. She came to fame with her TV series Mary Queen of Shops, which ran from 2007 until 2010.

She and Mr Newton are the youngest of five children. Their mother died when the siblings were mere teenagers; on Desert Island Discs in 2010, she told how she looked after Mr Newton by visiting the local butcher and asking what her mother would have bought.

Miss Portas, who also runs a communications agency and a string of charity shops, admitted that Miss Rickey wants another child – but said she does not have the energy to raise one. 'God, I couldn't have another one!' she said. 'I'm tired. I also like balance in my life.' Fertility expert Simon Fishel said the increase in same-sex relationships had led to more instances of sibling donations.

He told The Times: 'It would have been more unusual ten years ago. Now that kind of situation pops up once a month.

'If they can go for a family donor, that will be preferable and then it would be to a known donor. There's a very close relationship. You know where the genes are coming from. They are trying to keep it in the family.'

The couple converted their civil partnership into a marriage at Westminster City Hall in 2014
