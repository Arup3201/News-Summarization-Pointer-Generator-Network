Three  family members suspected of murdering a toddler have escaped justice because police can’t prove who was to blame, an inquest heard yesterday.

Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was found collapsed in her cot with ‘catastrophic’ head injuries and died in hospital  hours later.

Medical experts concluded that the  21-month-old girl received the fatal ‘blunt force trauma’ injuries close to the time at which she was found dying.

Tragic: Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was 21 months when she died of a blunt force head injury that caused her brain to bleed in February 2012. But two-and-a-half years later, no one has been charged with her death

Family: The court heard Summer, pictured with mother Victoria Rogers, came from a loving family who had no contact with social services

Her injuries were ‘inflicted by a third party’ and not the result of an accident, the inquest heard.

Police
 arrested Summer’s mother Victoria Rogers, 27, stepfather Craig Sharp, 
34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, on suspicion of murder because all
 three spent time being ‘responsible’ for the toddler during the period 
when experts said she must have been battered.

None of them could offer an explanation for the shocking injuries or recall an accident that could be to blame.

But
 coroner Oliver Longstaff was told that senior lawyers from the Crown 
Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence for a 
‘realistic prospect of a conviction’ and refused to charge any of the 
three suspects.

Summer was a healthy and happy girl from a ‘loving family’, the Bradford inquest was told.

Her parents separated shortly after her birth in May 2010.

Miss
 Rogers, an ancillary nurse, began a new relationship with Mr Sharp, a 
tyre garage manager, in October that year and  they were living together
 at  the time of Summer’s death in  February 2012.

Detective
 Constable Richard Peckett of West Yorkshire Police said there was ‘no 
history of  violence or abusive behaviour in the family and no social 
services involvement’.

Mystery: Summer's mother Victoria Rogers (right) was arrested on suspicion of murder after medical records showed her injuries could not have been inflicted by accident but was later released without charge

Confusion: Her stepfather Craig Sharpe (pictured with Summer) was also arrested and then released because the CPS could not determine who had been looking after the 21-month-old toddler

Summer’s father Joss Ratcliffe, 25, a plumber, was still involved in her care.

Police took statements from Summer’s relatives and medical experts compiled a series of reports into the injuries she suffered.

The inquest heard Miss Rogers told police she had gone into Summer’s bedroom at 5.30am before leaving for work.

The
 little girl said ‘bot, bot’ and Miss Rogers gave her a bottle of milk 
to drink in her cot. She then left the house in Dewsbury at around 6am, 
leaving Mr Sharp in charge.

DC Peckett said Miss Rogers’ account was 
that there was ‘interaction between Summer and herself’, which indicated
 the child was fit and well at that point.

Mr Sharp was briefly ‘in the house on his own’ but is not known to have gone into Summer’s bedroom.

At 7.40am, grandmother Susan Rogers arrived at the house to take over babysitting duties.

Investigation: Details of the incident that led to Summer's death are now emerging in a five-day inquest in Bradford, which her mother (pictured right with Summer) and other family members are attending

The
 inquest was told Summer was ‘checked on’ 10 minutes later in her bed 
and it wasn’t until 8.30am that Mrs Rogers realised something was wrong.

The
 retired nurse found Summer was ‘not breathing and her head was floppy’.
 She immediately started CPR and phoned relatives for help.

When
 paramedics arrived at the house at 8.54am, Summer was not breathing but
 had a pulse. She was rushed to hospital but died early the next day.

Forensic
 pathologist Dr Mathew Lyall, who carried out a post mortem, said Summer
 suffered bleeding and swelling on the brain, and had bruises on  her 
scalp – the classic ‘triad’  of injuries ‘strongly associated with 
non-accidental infantile head injuries’.

Dr
 Lyall said the fatal head injury was ‘caused by a third party’ and was 
not the result of a trivial impact. The pathologist said he didn’t know 
if Summer had been struck with an object or against a wall.

And the number of injuries to the head indicated ‘more than one application of force’ to Summer’s scalp, he said.

DC
 Peckett said a file was sent to the CPS but no one would be charged 
with any offence in relation to Summer’s death unless fresh evidence 
came to light.

He agreed 
with the coroner’s suggestion that the ‘sticking point’ preventing a 
prosecution was establishing how the fatal injury had been caused and 
‘who was responsible’.

Summer’s parents and other relatives are due to give evidence later in the week.

The hearing continues.
