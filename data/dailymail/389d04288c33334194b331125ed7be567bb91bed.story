Swiss alpine, climbing and outdoor company Mammut know how to show off their equipment in spectacular fashion.

The sports group have created jaw-dropping photographs of ski-jumpers, climbers, trail runners and mountain guides braving precarious precipices and heart-stopping descents in the Swiss mountains over the years, all captured by mountaineering photographer Robert Bösch.

For their most recent stunt, Mammut has paid homage to the first ascent of the Matterhorn as mountain guides  traced the route over the Hörnligrat ridge in a chain of lights, just like the roped party with Edward Whymper before them. 

The event, designed by agency ErdmannPeisker and captured by Bösch, was a test run for the 150th anniversary  in July 2015, for which the mountain guides will be illuminating the route of the ascent for one month.

Other incredible visuals have been created by climbers perching precariously on a needle-like mountain to crate a 'rock cactus' in the Bregaglia range, forming an 'X' on the steep slopes on the North Face of the Eiger, and standing on the narrow ledge of Kleines Kamel to test mountain boots.

Athletes climbed up 30 metres of vertically hanging rope and waited for two hours while the whole group assembled in a straight line to capture another amazing shot, while another group climbed to a summit plateau of 4,158 metres, with breathtaking results.
