The World Match Play Championship reaches its 50th anniversary this week with a return to its spiritual London home, but with sponsor Volvo ready to pull the plug.

There are five European Ryder Cup players in the 16-man field — plus the spiky American Patrick Reed — but none of the English trio who were part of the winning team at Gleneagles, nor world No 1 Rory McIlroy.

So will it be an anniversary to celebrate or a time to fret over the event’s lost lustre?

One look at the list of the early winners of the event would cause an inclination towards the latter. Six of the first seven tournaments were won by the Big Three: Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus.

But always to compare the event to those glory days would surely be a failure to recognise that the game has moved on.

McIlroy is acutely aware that his position carries the unwritten responsibility to help grow the game around the world.

After playing two events in Britain this month already, he is currently competing in Bermuda and will be moving on to play in the Far East, the Middle East and Australia before the end of next month. He can’t be everywhere, can he?

‘We promote tournaments all over the world and have long accepted it’s not realistic to think you’re going to get all the best players for every event,’ said Guy Kinnings, global head of golf at IMG.

‘What you’re after is enough to make sure you put on an event that will do justice to the history of the tournament and I think we’ll do that. We’re back in London, which is great given the event’s history. We’re also still all in feelgood mode after a wonderful Ryder Cup and we’ve got key players like Jamie Donaldson, Graeme McDowell, Victor Dubuisson, Henrik Stenson and Patrick Reed.’

Back in the days of Jack and Arnie, all matches were 36 holes at Wentworth. Now they’re played over 18 and there is a three-day group stage at London Golf Club in Kent to determine eight quarter-finalists on Saturday, with the semi-finals and final the following day.

So let’s toast the World Match Play at 50. It might not be the event we remember growing up but there will certainly be enough on show to make it a celebration. It all starts at the London Club on Wednesday.

By the time the next Ryder Cup is played on European soil in Paris in 2018, the country supplying the most representatives could, believe it or not, be the host nation itself.

Only three Frenchmen have ever played in the biennial contest, but there could be three on show at Paris National alone if a gifted trio in their early 20s continue their progress.

Leading the way, of course, is 24-year-old Victor Dubuisson, and what an inspiration he is proving to his countrymen. Right behind him is 24-year-old Alexander Levy, who is in the World Match Play field this week and already a two-time winner on tour this year, and 23-year-old Romain Wattel, who has finished 11th or better in five of his past six starts.

The timing of that first French Ryder Cup is beginning to look propitious.

Great White may never bite again

It’s good to hear Greg Norman is on his feet again and back doing the day job as CEO of his Great White Shark business empire following the horrific chainsaw accident last month that almost cost him the use of his hand.

As for his old day job, alas, the 59-year-old Australian has cast doubt on whether he will ever be able to play golf again. ‘We just don’t know yet,’ he told American television last week. ‘I had my first swing in the gym the other day, not hitting a golf ball but just swinging a light weighted club and it definitely feels different. I have to build up a lot of the muscle that was torn away.’

This column broke the news earlier this year that a long-running dispute Norman has had with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club meant there was little chance of him making a farewell Open appearance — it’s his last year of eligibility — at St Andrews in 2015. Now, sadly, the possibility looks even more remote.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK

‘It is a little disappointing to see the dirty laundry being out in public. I don’t like to see people’s great reputations being brought down by something that shouldn’t really happen in public. It should be done behind closed doors; the analysis should start there, not in the press.’

Week three of the Great American Ryder Cup Inquest and some wise words from Englishman Lee Westwood, as he points the finger in the direction of chief mutineer, Phil Mickelson, for his all-too-public condemnation of the US captain, five-time Open Champion Tom Watson.
