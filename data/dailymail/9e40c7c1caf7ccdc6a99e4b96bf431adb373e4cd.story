 '#X' -- no, that isn't a typo. That's AT&T's new symbol in its 'It Can Wait' campaign to combat texting while driving.

The telecommunications giant created the symbol to act as a shorthand for drivers. 

Before drivers are about to get behind they wheel, they can text the symbol to their friends to let them know that they are about to drive and cannot respond to any text messages. 

AT&T officials are encouraging people to  '#X' before they drive.

Survey: A survey conducted by AT&T found that 49 percent of adults and 43 percent of teens admitted to texting while driving

A driving force behind the campaign may be a survey conducted by AT&T last year which found that 49 percent of adults and 43 percent of teens admitting to texting and driving.

Charlene Lake, AT&T's senior vice president of public affairs, told USA Today that she was surprised by the study's findings.  

'It was sobering to realize that texting while driving by adults is not only high, it's really gone up in the last three years,' Lake said.
