Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal will not win the Premier League title and can’t see games out after losing their lead to Manchester City on Saturday.

Martin Demichelis’ 83rd minute equaliser at the Emirates meant Arsenal have now drawn their last three Premier League games, already leaving them six points behind leaders Chelsea after only four matches.

And the former Liverpool defender says the club have fallen further behind Chelsea this season after similar finishes last term.

Jamie Carragher claimed on Monday Night Football that he believed Arsenal would not win the league title

Speaking on Sky Sports, Carragher said: ‘I said start of the season, I don’t think Arsenal will win the title. The way I think of Arsenal is similar to Chelsea, one finished third one finished fourth. They probably spent similar money in the summer.

‘Why didn’t Arsenal get [Diego] Costa. Danny Welbeck might be a good signing. They need a left back, Chelsea go to Atletico Madrid and get Filipe Luis. They just do what they need to do.’

Arsenal struggled against the top four last season, and for the second game in a row lost a lead. Carragher sees a trend with the Gunners and believes Arsene Wenger’s side struggle to hold on to three points.

‘They don’t look as if they know how to see a game out. As soon as it went 2-2 I don’t fancy Arsenal to get a winner, I fancied City to win the game and they almost did.

‘It’s not just a physical thing with Arsenal, it’s a mental thing and that even could be more important.’
