Families should only be able to claim child benefit for their first two offspring, Iain Duncan Smith said yesterday.

A
 cap on the handouts would mean parents missing out on almost £700 a 
year if they have a third baby, according to plans backed by the Work 
and Pensions Secretary.

His 
approval sparked a new Coalition row with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg condemning the 'Chinese-style' state interference in parenting.

Discussing the two-child limit, Mr Duncan Smith declared in an interview 
with the Sunday Times yesterday: ‘It’s a brilliant idea.’

The
 plan, expected to slash £5 billion from the benefits bill, is being 
studied as a key policy for the Conservative election manifesto in 2015.

But
 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday said it would penalise the 
young and dismissed it as a ‘Chinese-style’ crackdown – a reference to 
the single-child policy imposed by Beijing since 1979.

British
 parents currently get £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for 
each subsequent child. But under the changes, parents who currently 
claim because their annual income is less than £50,000 would lose out on
 £696 a year. The reform would only apply to those who have a third baby
 after the measure is introduced.

A
 source close to Mr Duncan Smith said he backs the idea proposed by a 
member of David Cameron’s policy board – in part because it would force 
parents on benefits to consider whether they could afford children, 
rather than expecting taxpayers to pick up the tab.

The
 Work and Pensions Secretary proposed a new raft of welfare reforms last
 night, with the aim of cracking down on benefits tourism, getting 
people into work and cutting the welfare bill.

Mr
 Duncan Smith said that migrants from the EU should be banned from 
claiming welfare until they have been in the UK for two years to stop 
them exploiting the system.

He said that allies in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland supported his idea, and could help him change EU law.

The
 cabinet minister, speaking to the Sunday Times, also suggested changes 
for UK citizens, including the cap on child benefits, and removing 
housing benefits for young people.

He
 said that removing housing benefit for under-25s could be 'a massive 
money-saver' as it would encourage them to seek work rather than living 
in state-funded accommodation.

But
 he also made clear that he wanted the lowest-paid to get higher wages -
 perhaps by increasing the minimum wage. He said the move would help 
save money currently spent on tax credits.

He
 said: ‘Iain has sympathised with this idea for some time. He thinks 
it’s a serious money saver. And he believes that people on benefits 
should have to make the same choices as other people normally do. It is 
slightly infantilising unless you make people make those choices 
themselves.’

Mr 
Duncan Smith also supported cuts in housing benefit for the under-25s, 
saying it would get young people into work first rather than putting 
them into a flat paid for by welfare.

‘It
 is very difficult for them to take a job because they could lose their 
housing benefit and then they may lose their flat,’ he said.

The
 minister’s intervention is significant since it comes after Downing 
Street slapped down Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, a member of Mr Cameron’s No 
10 policy board, after he revealed that the party was considering the 
child benefit policy.

The
 minister’s approval comes after Chancellor George Osborne announced 
plans to slash £12 billion from the welfare budget by 2018 as he seeks 
to eliminate the budget deficit with spending cuts alone.

But
 Nick Clegg made clear that he wants child benefits left alone. He told 
the BBC1 Andrew Marr Show: ‘I will look at all proposals but some of the
 ones I have seen floated ... for instance, the idea of a two-child 
policy – I am not in favour of penalising the young.

‘I
 am not in favour of a sort of Chinese-style family policy saying the 
state says it is OK to have two children, it is not OK to have three 
children.

‘Remember this is 
child benefit that goes to families, many of whom are working. They are 
working very hard, often on low incomes.

‘My
 priority is a fair approach to ongoing fiscal consolidation. If you 
have to balance the books you mustn’t balance the books only on the 
working-age poor. We are, indeed, in it all together and that’s why 
everyone should make a contribution.’
