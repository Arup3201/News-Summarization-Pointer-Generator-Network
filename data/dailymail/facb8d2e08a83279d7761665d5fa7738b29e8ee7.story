Trailing 1-0 with time fast expiring and a star striker who looks shackled and shattered, managers have a decision to make.

When that forlorn frontman is Robin van Persie, the stakes are raised.

But that is the scenario which has faced both Louis van Gaal and David Moyes, Manchester United bosses present and past.

One acted, one stalled. One won, one lost.

Backlash: David Moyes feared supporter reprisal when he chose not to substitute Van Persie during December's defeat to Newcastle

For it was back in December that Moyes – fearing reprisal for removing his talisman – left an out of sorts and unfit Van Persie to toil through 90 minutes during a 1-0 home defeat to Newcastle.

Afterwards, a beleaguered Moyes offered: ‘I think if I'd brought him off some people would say 'What are you doing? You are 1-0 down and you're taking off your top goalscorer”.’

Instead, he had replaced a winger for a winger, a midfielder for a midfielder and a full-back for a full-back, all the while leaving Danny Welbeck to wonder what influence he might have had at the expense of his laboured team-mate.

Van Gaal, in contrast, hooked Van Persie with 14 minutes remaining of Holland’s second-round tie with Mexico on Sunday.

Sure, it raised eyebrows, but, significantly and to game-changing effect, it raised the energy, urgency and invention of his side.

Come full-time they were leading 2-1, Van Persie’s replacement – Klaas-Jan Huntelaar – having assisted Wesley Sneijder’s equaliser and kept his nerve to score the winner from the penalty spot.

Van Gaal, unlike Moyes, had not been afraid of the subsequent scrutiny which would have arrived in the wake of a defeat.

He said: ‘The substitution was tactical. Let’s not forget before he joined the team he was recovering from an injury. It’s difficult for him to keep up 90 minutes, especially in these conditions.’

Huntelaar’s goal was the third consecutive match in which a Van Gaal introduction had made the difference.

Memphis Depay fired the winner in the 3-2 victory against Australia and he was again on target from the bench in the 2-0 success over Chile, fellow substitute Leroy Fer having opened the scoring.

On both occasions Van Gaal had made bold calls, forward Depay having replaced a defender against Australia and playmaker Sneijder the man to make way for Fer against Chile.

Such conviction characterises Van Gaal, just like a lack of it ultimately undermined Moyes.
