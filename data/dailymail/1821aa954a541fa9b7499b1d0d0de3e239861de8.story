When teenage tearaway Mark Hook was treated to a three-month ‘character building’ trip to Africa it was supposed to deter him from a life of crime.

But just weeks after his £7,000 tour of Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia ‘Safari Boy’ Hook was arrested for drink driving and carrying a knife.

Now, almost 20 years and 113 offences later, Hook has been branded a ‘perpetual villain’ by a judge tired of constantly seeing him in the dock.

Hook, 35, was in jail last night 
after being sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court for his latest crimes – 
mugging an elderly shopper and handling credit cards stolen from another
woman.

He was sentenced to
18 months in prison by Judge Jamie Tabor QC but because he has been in 
custody on remand for nine months he will be free again within days.

In
his 32nd court appearance, Judge Tabor told career criminal Hook: ‘We 
have been looking at each other across this court for many years.

‘There
have been many protestations from you that you are going to become an 
honest citizen and behave yourself. So far you haven’t.’

He added: ‘You have an appalling record.’

Hook’s
88-day junket to Africa caused nationwide condemnation in 1993 and was 
even criticised by the then prime minister John Major.

Expelled from school at 14, Hook had been sent to Bryn Melyn in North Wales, a therapy centre for unruly teenagers.

The
trip was supposed to take him out of the environment where he had been a
young offender and show him places where people were worse off than 
him.

Hook claims he is a 
direct ancestor of soldier Henry Hook who won the Victoria Cross 
fighting Zulus at Rorke’s Drift in Natal, South Africa in 1879.

But the only thing the teenager brought back from his tour of Africa was a determination to continue his life of crime.

In
January 1994, just months after the trip, Hook appeared at Gloucester 
Crown Court for 34 offences including burglary and taking a car without 
consent and he was given a year’s supervision order.

That year he was back in court twice for burglary offences, handling stolen goods and driving while disqualified.

By the time he was an adult, Hook had blossomed into a lifelong criminal with a heroin and crack cocaine habit to feed.

Over the last 18 years he has served prison sentences for aggravated burglary, theft and wounding.In
his most recent court appearance, Judge Tabor said Hook’s crimes were 
exactly the same as when he was last jailed – for two years – in 2009 
for mugging a frail 80-year-old man in the street.

He said: ‘Your latest offences were planned and you acted in concert with another person. You are a perpetual villain.’

Hook's innocent smile as a child, left, gave little indication of the terror he would inflict on his victims over the years. Right, he laughs in in 1994 having been to court for dozens more offences after the taxpayer-funded trip

Hook
pleaded guilty to stealing a bag from an elderly shopper in an alleyway
near an Asda store in Gloucester in September last year. He also 
admitted handling credit cards stolen on the same afternoon from another
elderly woman.

A second man, Jason Marshall, 23, was involved in the offences and has already been jailed for 18 months.

Marshall
had been arrested soon after the offence and the court heard how Hook 
had called Crimestoppers claiming he had witnessed the robbery and tried
to stop the assailant.

Prosecutor
Andrew Wilkins said: ‘He was aware the robber had been arrested and he 
was worried he might be implicated because his fingerprints might be 
found on the stolen property.’

Judge Tabor was unimpressed by Hook’s actions saying: ‘It was a pre-emptive strike by him to try to explain his fingerprints.’

Hook denied any involvement in the offences but was arrested and charged.

Undeterred
by his arrest, Hook went into Debenham’s in Gloucester two weeks later 
with credit cards taken from both women and tried to use them.

Dermot Clarke, defending, said: ‘He knows you well, your honour, and he doesn’t want to shilly-shally with you.

‘He
is 35 and he has got a four-year-old daughter. He has not seen her 
since he was remanded in custody because her mother will not take her to
prison.

‘You may have heard it before but I have no doubt of his sincerity when he says he never wants to be here again.’

Judge Tabor responded: ‘I don’t want him here again.’

Mr
Clarke said that while on remand Hook had been treated for his drug 
addiction and had become the jail’s race relations representative.

But the judge said the only factor in Hook’s favour was that he had pleaded guilty.

He sentenced him to 18 months for theft and six months for handling stolen goods. The sentences will run concurrently.

Hook’s
mother, Rita Dolan, has blamed her son’s continued life of crime on the
fact that social services lavished money on him instead of punishing 
him.

She has said previously: ‘They spoilt him rotten and did not prepare him for real life.’

But Hook has been adept at manipulating the system.

In 2001 he admitted sending a forged doctor’s note to court so he could spend Christmas at home.

Then
in 2009 he pledged to work with the Prince’s Trust on a scheme where 
experienced burglars helped householders to improve their home security.

Mark Hook was one of a host of young offenders pampered by the justice system in the 1990s in a misguided attempt to put them on the straight and narrow.

In previous years, the delinquents would have been locked up in borstals or sent to approved schools.

Burglar: Clinton Bowen, also known as Canal Boy, grew up to be a drug addict who targeted the elderly

But in the mid-1990s they had become ‘disadvantaged young persons’ who were given all the help the taxpayer could afford.

Clinton Bowen was treated to a three-month £12,000 barge holiday in 1997 in an effort to deter him from crime.

The 15-year-old became known as ‘Canal Boy’. He grew up to be a drug addict who specialised in raiding the homes of the elderly.

In 2001 he was jailed for three years for stealing from a 91-year-old great-grandmother and in 2009 he got five years for carrying out 22 burglaries while on parole.

His brother Casey earned the name ‘Pocket Money Boy’ when he was paid £60 a week after 37 arrests between 1992 and 1994.

After paying out £1,560, social services stopped the money because his offending increased.

Jason Cooper was branded ‘World Tour Boy’ after going on holidays costing the taxpayer £50,000 to ‘instil feelings of self-worth by broadening his horizons’.

But Cooper, now 39, progressed to a life in and out of jail for crimes including conspiracy to rob a post office, burglary, fraud and car crime.

He even tried to sue social services claiming he had not been taught basic life skills such as how to  claim benefits.
