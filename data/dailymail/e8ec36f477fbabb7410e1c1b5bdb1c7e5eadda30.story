A heap of mangled metal, this is all that remains of a bi-plane that crash-landed in a field.

The 1930s design Tiger Moth smashed into pieces after clipping a tree as it tried to land in Denbighshire, north Wales.

Luckily, however, the pilot was unhurt and calmly walked away from the wreckage, telling a witness: 'I just feel such a fool.'

Damaged: The plane ended up on its side after the crash near Eryrys, Denbighshire

The man, in his 40s, was wearing a cream linen suit and was later spotted in a local pub.

The drama was watched by Marilyn Seldon, 60, who said the pilot had earlier knocked on her door to ask whether he could 'park' his plane in a field near the village of Eryrys.

'I was at the end of the field when he tried to come down a couple of times, unsuccessfully,' she told the Daily Mirror. 'I could see he wasn't going to make it so I moved out of the way quickly.

'One of his wings hit a tree, which flipped him over. He missed some electric wires by inches.

'I called, "Are you all right?" He scrambled out and took a photo.'

Safety: The wreckage was sealed off. The pilot, a man in his 40s from London, has promised to clear the field

Ms Sheldon's daughter Pam, 36, described the crash as one of the 'scariest things' she had seen.

She said that, only a few minutes earlier, her mother had been standing in the exact spot where the plane crashed on Sunday afternoon.

'I was taking pictures of the plane coming in to land when it happened, but I didn't have a clear view when it hit the ground', she told the BBC.

'I was so relieved when I ran over to see that my mum and the pilot were both OK.'

The pilot, from London, who was on holiday with his family, has promised to clear the field.
