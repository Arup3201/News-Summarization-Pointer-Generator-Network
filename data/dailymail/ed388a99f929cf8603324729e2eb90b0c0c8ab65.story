The mother of the two Boston bombing suspects had become an increasingly strict Muslim in recent years and cried for days when her eldest son said he wanted to move out before he was married because it was against the family's faith.

Alyssa Kilzer, now 23, visited the home for facials between 2008 and 2012 and has revealed details about her regular interactions with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva and her younger son Dzhokar, 19, who police arrested last night after a 24 hour manhunt. The woman's older son Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a shoot-out on Friday morning.

Kilzer said she started getting facials from Zubeidat at a Boston salon six years ago but when the woman left the spa, she began going to her crowded third-floor Cambridge apartment to continue the treatment.

'The staircase was crowded with their shoes, the house filled with noises of arguing, cooking, etc..' the writer and yoga teacher recalled in an eye-opening piece for Fox News. 'She would often apologize for this.'

Kilzer said Zubeidat's two daughters and Dzhokar always struck her as 'perfectly nice and normal kids' who were about the same age she was.

And the mother gave 'a damn good facial,' prompting her, along with her mother and sister, to keep going back for years.

But Kilzer said, over that time, she noticed a distinct change in the woman who she'd come to know, who became noticeably more religious.

On one visit, in either 2010 or 2011, Dzhokar, who usually put a parking pass on her car so she wouldn't get a fine, wasn't home so Zubeidat did went out to the street and did it instead.

Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva, mother of the terrorist suspect brothers Dzokhar and Tamerlan, said her sons' are '100 per cent innocent'

'I noticed that she first put on a hijab before going outside,' she explained. 'She had never worn a hijab while working at the spa previously, or inside the house, and I was really surprised.'

But she says the hijab shouldn't have shocked her so much 'because she had become increasingly religious while I was in college.'

'She often mentioned Allah, and the lessons of the Koran.'

Kilzer gave one example in the Fox News article where she said she told the woman how her brother was close with her mother and would care for her in future, to which she said Zubeidat responded: 'Allah will reward him.'

Other changes Kilzer noticed in the woman included her shying away from the opposite sex.

She said she started to refuse seeing boys who had gone through puberty because a religious figure she had spoken with told her it was 'sacrilegious,' and she also mourned when her son wanted to move out of the family home.

'She told me that she had cried for days when her oldest son, Tamerlan, told her that he wanted to move out, going against her culture's tradition of the son staying in the house with the mother until marriage,' Kilzer wrote.

Nice: Alyssa Kilzer said the family were always kind to her but she did notice some changes in bahaviour

The former client recalled how Zubeidat started telling her 'Don't worry, there aren't men in the house today,' when she asked to use the restroom during her sessions, something which didn't bother her in the least.

During a facial session in her last year of college, Kilzer became concerned and annoyed when the woman started quoting a conspiracy theory about how 9/11 was a ploy by the American government to 'make America hate Muslims.'

According to Kilzer, Zubeidat said: 'It's real. My son knows all about it. You can read on the internet.'

'I have to say I felt kind of scared and vulnerable when she said this, as I am distinctly American, and was lying practically naked in her living room,' she wrote in the Fox News story.

Brothers: Kilzer said she saw very little of Tamerlan, left, but that Dzhokar, right, was friendly

She said in her contact with Zubeidat's daughters and Dzhokar, they were always friendly and kind.

But she said she saw very little of Tamerlan.

'I think I only met Tamerlan twice, and he wasn't friendly,' she said. She described how Zubeidat mentioned arguing with him and how she was worried about him.

Kilzer said she stopped going to the woman for facials in January 2012 in part because of her increasingly strict religious views and thoughts about 9/11.

However, she said the woman struck her as a hard-working woman who cared a lot for her family.

She said she couldn't believe it when her mom called her to tell her that Dzhokar was suspected of detonating the two bombs that killed there and maimed 170 at Monday's Boston Marathon.

'As her client for years I felt affection for Zubeidat and was very distraught to hear that her sons could have committed such horrific crimes,' she wrote.
