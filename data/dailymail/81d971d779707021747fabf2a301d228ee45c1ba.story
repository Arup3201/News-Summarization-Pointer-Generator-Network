Hull defender Liam Rosenior is unsurprised to see manager Steve Bruce linked with the Newcastle job.

Geordie Bruce has already been touted as a possible replacement for Alan Pardew despite the latter still being in a job at St James' Park.

Defeat at home to Hull on Saturday in front of what is expected to be a hostile Magpies crowd might weaken Pardew's grasp still further, while also strengthening Bruce's hand.

Alan Pardew is under increasing pressure at Newcastle United following a poor start to the season

For his part, the former Sunderland boss has shown no interest in the post he turned down in 2004 and has repeatedly labelled any such speculation 'disrespectful' to both Hull and Pardew.

But Rosenior sees it as a mark of his success at the KC Stadium, where Bruce has overseen an unlikely promotion, an even unlikelier run to the FA Cup final and a brief dalliance with the Europa League in two whirlwind years.

'It's no surprise to me or anyone around here (to see speculation about Bruce). The manager has been fantastic ever since he walked in the front door,' said Rosenior.

'He's been a breath of fresh air through the club. There's only four or five of us left from before he arrived. It's been a great journey and he's now bringing in £10million centre forwards and England internationals. That shows what a great job he's done.

'It's no surprise to me that other teams will be interested in his services.'

Bruce's Sunderland history, and his own taunts at the hand of Newcastle fans down the years, make a move to Tyneside a tricky sell, but Rosenior also thinks the spirit he has fostered in East Yorkshire would be hard to let go.

'In football anything can happen, but the manager is a fantastic guy and a great manager and whatever happened it's been a pleasure playing for him,' Rosenior added.

Some supporters have given up on watching their team and decided to not renew cheap season tickets

'There's a respect and a bond there. If you look at all the great teams of the past like Manchester United, Chelsea and Barcelona, although I'm not comparing us to them, there's a bond between the staff and the players that makes you successful.

'That's what we've got here.

'Why would I want to lose one of, if not the, most important part of something that's been so successful?'

Rosenior also attempted to downplay with humour the reunion between Pardew and David Meyler.

Pardew was banned for seven matches last season for headbutting the Tigers midfielder on the touchline.

I think (David) is going to take his boxing gloves up there just in case!,' said a joking Rosenior.

'It was an unfortunate incident and goes to show how much people care. It got out of hand.

'But it's not about the sideshows. The important thing is going up there to win the game.'
