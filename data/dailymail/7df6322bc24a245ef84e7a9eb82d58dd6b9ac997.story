Minnesota Twins star prospect Byron Buxton was hospitalised after an outfield collision during his debut for Double-A New Britain.

The 20-year-old centre fielder sustained concussion when he crashed into right fielder Mike Kvasnicka diving for a ball during the fifth innings of New Britain's 8-5 victory over the Bowie Baysox.

The jarring collision delayed play for more than half an hour as medical staff treated Buxton.

Rising star: Byron is regarded as the hottest prospect across the minor leagues of baseball

Big future: The 20-year-old centre fielder was selected second overall in the 2012 draft 

‘He's alert. He has a concussion, so we'll have to take the normal procedures and protocol for concussion symptoms. He'll certainly be watched. It could have been a lot worse. We are grateful for just the concussion. That was very scary,’ said Ryan.

At the time of the collision the 6’2, 190 pound Buxton was 0 for 3 with three strikeouts in the game.

Buxton is considered the top prospect in all the minor leagues and was selected second overall in the 2012 draft. Entering into the season, Buxton was promoted from Class A Fort Myers on Monday.
