The 18-year-old New York University freshman who fell 15-stories to his death on Monday from the top of his dormitory was running around stark naked and high on mushrooms according to witnesses and police sources.

Aspiring rapper, Titan Lee-Hai, was acting erratically only moments before his fatal fall and punched one witness in the face after he entered the same elevator which took the Trinadad student to the roof.

Shazim Khurshid, 19, told the New York Post that it looked like Lee-Hai was on 'a lot of drugs' prior to his fall at 3.20 am from NYU’s Third North dorm at 3rd Ave and 12th St.

Another student, who wished to remain anonymous told the New York Daily News that Lee-Hai had taken mushrooms and was reacting badly to their effects.

'He wasn’t a troubled kid,' the young woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said to the Daily News. 'It was a bad trip. He was alone, just chillin’. He was on mushrooms.'

'He was a good kid.'

Tragic: NYU freshman,Titan Lee-Hai is now believed to have taken hallucinogenic drugs before his fatal fall on Monday morning

Fall or jump? 19-year-old New York University freshman Titan Lee-Hai jumped off the Third North Residence Hall early Monday morning and a witness said it seemed like he was on 'a lot of drugs'

'I was the last person to see him alive,' Kurshid said. 'I was in the elevator, and he just walked in and punched me in the face, and then he asked me where he was. He was naked when he walked in. So, it was pretty obvious he was not in his senses. He had no sense of where he was or what time it was.'

When he reached the top floor of the building, Lee-Hai opened a door which triggered the building's fire alarm. 

After falling, he was taken to Bellevue hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Police originally believed the death was a suicide, but now believe drugs were to blame and don't know if Lee-Hai jumped or fell.

Toxicology reports won't be available for several weeks.

Loss: Lee-Hai was from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. The university issued a statement late Monday morning expressing 'deepest sympathies' for his family and friends

In his system: Toxicology reports won't be available for several weeks. Shazim Khurshid, right, says Lee-Hai punched him out of the blue before boarding the elevator going up to the top floor

University spokesman John Beckman issued a statement late Monday morning, saying: 'It is with great sorrow that we report that a freshman was found in an interior courtyard in the residence hall where he lived.'

Mr Beckman said that the student's death seemed to be the result of a fall, but that police and University officials are investigating what led up to the event to determine the exact cause.

'The University expresses its deepest sympathies to the family and loved ones of this young man; they are in our hearts and our prayers this morning,' Mr Beckman said.

A fellow freshman who lives in the dorm said the fire alarm went off around the same time the man jumped.

'We were evacuated from the building at around 3:15. My friends said they saw a body lying in the courtyard. It's sad,' she told the Post.

Today marked the first day of the Spring
 2014 semester. Crisis counselors were brought in to provide support to 
grieving students this morning.

Barred: The university installed special gold bars to prevent students from jumping off the upper floor's of the school's library after a string of suicides in the 2003-2004 academic year

The top 50 college has received a 
reputation for its high suicide rate after a string of four deaths in 
the 2003-2004 academic year.

This prompted the school to install special gold bars on the atrium of Bobst Library where many of the suicides occurred.

Students
 have argued that while the bars stop suicides from happening in the 
library, the university isn't doing a good enough job at addressing the 
root of the issue.

In an opinion piece published in the student newspaper
 a week after the library bars installation, Emma Dolhai argued that the
 screen wouldn't stop determined students from finding a way to commit 
suicide.

'All the screens really do is ensure that some of [the suicides] are quieter. Screens simply do not prevent self-destruction, in the same way that building prisons does not lower crime rates,' Ms Dolhai wrote.

She pointed out that the wait in the university's Wellness Center to see a counselor can be 15 minutes to half an hour and involves a mountain of paperwork.

'The lack of effective health care for the struggling verges on the absurd. NYU Wellness seems to operate on the mantra that a student must make a conscious, devoted effort in order to receive help. Those struggling with suicide, however, are often the last to come forward of their own free will,' she said.

According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suicide is the third leading cause of death among young adults ages 18-24.

No studies currently track suicide rates at the nation's colleges, but many campus professionals believe it to be the second leading cause of death among students.
