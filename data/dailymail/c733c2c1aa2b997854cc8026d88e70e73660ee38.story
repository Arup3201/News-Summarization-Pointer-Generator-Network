An elephant lies maimed and dead by a pool of its own blood, one of at least 26 of the majestic creatures slaughtered for their ivory in Central African Republic.

Four calves were among the victims of the massacre, which was carried out by 17 members of the 'transitional government forces' armed with Kalashnikov rifles in Dzanga Bai, a World Heritage site known as the 'Village of Elephants'.

After their tusks were ripped from their carcasses, locals began hacking meat from the bones.

Horror: Gunmen massacred at least 26 elephants in the Central African Republic - all for their tusks

Waste: The creatures lost their lives at a World Heritage Site at which as as many as 200 a day gather to drink nutrients from the sands

Senseless deaths: The animals were killed by 17 men armed with rifles

Charity workers described the area, at which between 50-200 of the animals gather every day to drink nutrients present in sands, as an 'elephant mortuary'.

In 2011, almost 25 tons of contraband 
ivory was collected from around the world - the product of an estimated 
2,500 slaughtered elephants â€“ making it the worst year for poaching 
since ivory harvesting was banned in 1989.

Figures
for 2012 are yet unknown, but most black-market ivory harvested in 
Kenya and Tanzania is bound for Asia, with China, Japan and Thailand 
among the top destinations.

It is used for billiard balls, piano keys, carved art and jewelry.

The number of elephants killed by poacher has doubled in the last decade.

Today,
eight out of every ten elephant deaths is the result of poaching, 
compared with four out of ten deaths six years ago, the prosecutor's 
office said.

'The killing has started,' Jim Leape, WWF's international director general, said in a statement. 'The Central African Republic must act immediately to secure this unique World Heritage site.

'The brutal violence we are witnessing in Dzanga Bai threatens to destroy one of the world's great natural treasures, and to jeopardize the future of the people who live there.'

The 17 killers have now left the area, but the WWF fear the slaughter could continue.

The Central African Republic has been rocked by violence and chaos since the beginning of the year, and WWF and other conservation organisations left the field office next to the Bai in April for security reasons.

Mr Leape said international governments needed to help. 'The international community must also act to assist the Central African Republic to restore peace and order in this country to safeguard its population and its natural heritage.

'WWF also asks Cameroon and the Republic of Congo to assist the Central African Republic in preserving this World Heritage Site, which not only encompasses the Bai, but also includes large neighbouring areas of these two countries.

'The events in Dzanga Bai are a vivid reminder of the existential threat faced by forest elephants in Central Africa. Populations of this species have plummeted 62 per cent over the past ten years.

'The unfolding tragedy in Dzanga Bai must also spur the governments of China and Thailand to act on their commitments to shut down the ivory markets in their countries that are fueling this illicit trade.'

Elephants gather in Dzanga Bai every day and gather nutrients from the sands. They are shown here in a TV documentary
