A family doctor has been struck off for secretly filming the intimate examination of hundreds of women patients using a camera hidden in his wristwatch.

Dr Davinderjit Bains, 46, recorded hours of footage with the £60 spy device as he carried out ‘unnecessary and inappropriate’ inspections, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told.

The abuse continued for two years until his 19-year-old lodger told police he had filmed her showering and assaulted her.

When Bains was arrested at his surgery in Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, officers discovered 361 video clips filmed on the watch - some as long as 45 minutes.

Around 3,000 potential victims were contacted but the exact number is thought to be ‘close to 300’ - aged between 14 and 51.

A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service banned Bains from practicing.

The tribunal in Manchester was told that his conviction earlier this year means that his fitness to practice is impaired, and he should be struck off.

In March, Bains appeared at Swindon Crown Court where he admitted 39 counts of sexual assault and voyeurism and asked for a further 65 offences to be taken into consideration.

He is serving a 12 year prison sentence and is not represented at the hearing.

The doctor was described as a ‘sexual predator’.

He used an analogue timepiece - a 4GB Waterproof HD Spy Watch DVR - has
 simple on and off buttons to record and can be bought online for less 
than £60.

Hidden in the 
number six was a tiny high-definition camera, which he used to record 
examinations between 2010 and 2012 that police said were ‘for his own 
gratification’ and ‘could not be justified as an examination’.

Detectives tracked down the victims by matching their faces on the film with patient records.

The GP, who is separated from his wife, was suspended by the General Medical Council following his arrest last year.

Opening
 the MPTS hearing Ben Fitzgerald for the General Medical Council said: 
'Dr Bains faces the allegation that his fitness to practise is impaired.

'He was convicted of a large number of sexual offences and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.

Summarising, there were 13 counts of sexual assault on a female by penetration, 11 sexual assaults on a female, two counts of sexual activity with a female under 16, and 13 counts of voyeurism.

'Dr Bains, whilst being employed as a GP in Royal Wootten Bassett, used his position of trust and responsibility of those in his care to carry out a campaign of sexual assault and voyeurism between 2009 and 2012 on 29 different victims, all but one was his patient.

'His conduct came to light in June 2012 as a result of sexual abuse of Miss A, a lodger.

'He covertly videoed her on a number of occasions.

'She reported it to the police and as a result of the investigation unearthed evidence of a large number of sexual assaults and other victims. The police found videos on his computer taken by him which showed him performing intimate examinations between 2009 and 2012.

'The videos had been recorded using a specially constructed watch that he was using to record for his own sexual gratification.'

He said the doctor had been of previous good character. He qualified in India in 1993 and came to the UK in 2003.

He worked as a GP from 2007 and had been working at the Tinkers Lane Surgery in Wootten Bassett for four years at the time when he was exposed by Miss A.

Disturbing: The disgraced doctor also had this watch containing a small camera

Many victims of the doctor thought his behaviour was strange but feared upsetting the delicate doctor-patient relationship.

One 21-year-old victim told the Daily Mail of her horrific experience.

She went to see Bains in May last year after experiencing vaginal bleeding following sex with her partner.

She was offered an appointment with Bains.

The surgery had no female doctors and, because of the intimate nature of the problem, she decided to take her mother with her.

‘He asked me why I was there and I explained briefly. He started asking very strange questions. My mum and I were looking at each other, a bit taken aback.’

Bains told Kate - not her real name - that he would need to examine her.

‘I had expected that,’ she said, ‘so I’d prepared myself. He asked if I wanted my mum to leave, and I said yes.’

Bains disappeared for a couple of minutes, telling Kate not to get undressed until he returned.

She says: ‘I assumed it was normal procedure before a patient undressed — that maybe he was closing blinds somewhere, or locking a connecting door in case someone came in.’

When he came back, locking the door behind him, Bains told Kate to undress. He did not pull the examination bed curtain around her, close the blinds or offer her any privacy.

‘He watched me getting undressed,’ says Kate. ‘He was very quiet. I felt very uncomfortable. I was trying to pull my top down so he wouldn’t see. But I didn’t know what was normal.

‘He put some gloves on and asked me to get up onto the bed. He said he was going to do a visual examination and that if there was anything he didn’t like the look of, he’d take a sample.’

For the next 20 minutes, Bains ‘examined’ Kate, filming himself all the time. ‘It was a long, long time,’ she says. ‘but I just thought he was being thorough.’

Her mother assumed that they were talking and had not realised how long he had been intimately examining her daughter.

Kate remembers that he was shaking and seemed very nervous. At the end of the consultation, Bains gave Kate the all-clear and told her to get dressed.

Her mother said: ‘When she came out of the room, I commented on how long it had taken and she said she’d never felt so degraded in her life. I remember saying “Welcome to our world”, because all women have to endure that kind of thing at some point. I feel so stupid now.’
