A young woman was killed by a friend on Friday night in a prank gone horribly wrong, it has been claimed.

Premila Lal, 18, was allegedly hiding in a closet and jumped out around 8pm when she startled Nerrek Daniel Galley, 21, who reportedly shot her in a Longmont, Colorado home.

A neighbor, who asked to remain unidentified, said she and her husband called the police after they heard yelling and screaming. She told The Times-Call that 'three or four' individuals got into a car and sped away, leaving the front door open.

Galley and two of Lal's male relatives, ages 12 and 15, loaded her into her own vehicle and took her to Longmont United Hospital, The Denver Post reprorts.

The neighbor woman also told The Times-Call said her husband walked over there and saw blood and an abandoned mobile phone on the stairway. He came and got her, and together called 911.

Longmont police were called at 8:02pm regarding the shooting. Just two minutes later, officers were called to the house regarding an 'unknown problem.'

Lal died at approximately 9pm, Longmont police Cmdr. Jeff Satur confirmed.

The home, located on Cambridge Drive, was allegedly a rental. Neighbors have said that residents frequently move in and out of the property.

A unidentified man also told The Times-Call that he believed a younger family lived in the home. The neighbor said he often saw a 'gangsta'-type man hanging out on the property out front, speaking on the phone.

Galley, of Orem, Utah, was arrested at approximately 2:11am on Saturday. He is suspected of child abuse and reckless endangerment, says an arrest report released to the media on Saturday morning.

Galley is also suspected of permitting a juvenile to have a firearm. This stems from allegedly allowing Lal's 15-year-old brother to have a handgun in his possession without the permission of the boy's parents, Satur said, which is a felony under Colorado law.

The report, written by Longmont police officer Billy Owens, alleges that upon searching the residence, he saw a handgun with a live round stuck near its ejection port on top of the stairs in the living room.

In his report, Owens said Longmont police are requesting a high bond for Galley, because he has 'no ties to the community with a permanent residence.'

Longmont police are working with the Boulder County District Attorney's office to determine whether Galley will be charged in relation to Lal's death.

Lal was a high school track star and graduate of Niwot High School, CBS Denver reports. Her parents are heartbroken over the loss of their daughter.

'My life ended so suddenly and I think it’s going to take a few more days for us to really, you know, comprehend she’s gone,' Praveen Lal said.
