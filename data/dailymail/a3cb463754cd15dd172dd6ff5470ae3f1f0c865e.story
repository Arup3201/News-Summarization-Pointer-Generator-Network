The perfect cup of coffee is an elusive dream for many. Every morning, millions wait in line for an overpriced brew, only to find it’s too cold, too sweet or too weak.

But one U.S. technology firm is on a mission to change that.

Briggo has recently unveiled its Coffee Haus at the University of Texas in Austin- a robotic kiosk that allows you to order you perfect cup of coffee from your mobile.

The Coffee Haus feature real-time order status and a peek at Briggo's patented robotics, which are precisely calibrated to deliver a full menu of specialty coffees

The Coffee Haus combines smartphone control and precision robotic technology with artisan coffee in what they claim will ‘revolutionise the coffee experience’.

The kiosk features real-time order status. Customers tune and pre-order personalised drinks via their mobiles or tablets.

'Our Coffee Haus creates artisan coffee drinks 24/7 with a level of accuracy never before seen in the coffee world,' said Kevin Nater, chief executive officer of Briggo

The website gives customers full control of their coffee experience with drink customisation, purchasing, text notification, social media sharing and ‘favouriting’ of a drink for easy re-ordering.

Location mapping also helps the customer choose a kiosk and see the wait time and order.

This, according to the company, cuts out the long waits and variability typical of standard coffee shops.

Briggo and fuseproject partnered on the idea of a new experience of coffee, which was the brainchild of technologist Charles Studor.

Fuseproject said it was important for the design to turn Briggo into a destination rather than a thing.

‘We named it Coffee Haus and designed it to look, smell, and feel like a coffee shop. We designed the Digital Experience so that it spans the web, smart phone app, and kiosk.

‘All are functionally and visually connected to the industrial design.’

The digital touch points: web, app, and kiosk are optimised for individual platforms, and the experience is designed so you can quickly build your beverage.

Once the coffee is exactly how you like it, you can be sure that no matter which Coffee Haus you get it from, it will be exactly and perfectly how you like it, every time

After you have your coffee, you can provide feedback via the app or the web and keep adjusting your coffee until you get the perfect cup.

The new Briggo Coffee Haus builds on the original test-market kiosk installed on the University of Texas campus in 2011.

The company now plans to move into full deployment of Briggo systems at hospitals, airports, and colleges and companies throughout the US later this year.
