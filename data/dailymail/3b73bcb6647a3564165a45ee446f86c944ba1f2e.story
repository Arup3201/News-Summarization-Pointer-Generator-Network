A judge has said the rights of two Christian B&B owners to bar a gay couple from sharing a room were outweighed by the need to  correct ‘centuries of discrimination’ against gay people.

The Supreme Court yesterday rejected the claim by Peter and Hazelmary Bull that they acted within the law when they refused a room to Steven Preddy and Martyn Hall because they were not a heterosexual married couple.

The decision ends a five-year legal battle that began when Mr Preddy and Mr Hall, backed by the Government’s Equality and Human Rights Commission, took the Bulls to court under equality laws.

Peter Bull, 74, and his wife Hazelmary, 69, the Christian owners of a guesthouse, lost their Supreme Court case

Lady Hale, Deputy President of the 
Supreme Court, dismissed the Bulls’ appeal to the country’s highest 
court, saying that discrimination against homosexuals was ‘an affront to
 their dignity as human beings’.

She
 added that hundreds of years of persecution of gays had led European 
human rights judges in Strasbourg to require strong reasons to justify 
discrimination against them.

‘It
 is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting 
hotel keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a 
disproportionate limitation on their right  to manifest their religion,’
 Lady Hale said.

It 
follows a series of cases in which judges in London and Strasbourg have 
found against Christians who dissented from gay rights laws.

Among
 those who lost were Lillian Ladele, a registrar in Islington who wanted
 to avoid presiding at civil partnership ceremonies, and Gary McFarlane,
 a Relate counsellor sacked after he was questioned by his employers 
over his attitude to gay rights following a statement that he would not 
give sex therapy to a gay couple.

The
 Bulls were taken to court after they turned Mr Hall and Mr Preddy away 
from their Chymorvah Hotel, in Marazion, Cornwall, in September 2008.

The
 Supreme Court judges have upheld an earlier ruling that the Bulls, whose 
lawyers were paid for by the Christian Institute think tank, must pay 
£3,600 in compensation to Mr Hall and Mr Preddy.

Mrs
 Bull said yesterday: ‘We are deeply disappointed and saddened by the 
outcome. We are just ordinary Christians who believe in the importance 
of marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Our B&B is not 
just our business, it’s our home.

‘These beliefs are not based on  hostility to anyone. We certainly bear no ill-will to Steven and Martyn.’

She
 added: ‘Britain ought to be a country of freedom and tolerance, but it 
seems religious beliefs must play second fiddle to the new orthodoxy of 
political correctness.

Dismissing the appeal, Lady Hale, deputy president of the Supreme Court, said: 'Sexual orientation is a core component of a person's identity which requires fulfilment through relationships with others of the same orientation.'

Homosexuals 'were long denied the possibility of fulfilling themselves through relationships with others', she said, adding: 'This was an affront to their dignity as human beings which our law has now (some would say belatedly) recognised.

'Homosexuals can enjoy the same freedom and the same relationships as any others. But we should not under-estimate the continuing legacy of those centuries of discrimination, persecution even, which is still going on in many parts of the world.

'It is no doubt for that reason that Strasbourg requires "very weighty reasons" to justify discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.

'It is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting hotel-keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a disproportionate limitation on their right to manifest their religion.'

If Mr Preddy and Mr Hall ran a hotel which denied a double room to Mr and Mrs Bull, whether on the grounds of their Christian beliefs or on the grounds of their sexual orientation, they would find themselves in the same situation that Mr and Mrs Bull find themselves today.

'We appealed to the Supreme Court to 
introduce a bit more balance when dealing with competing rights of 
sexual orientation and religious liberty.

'Somehow, we have got to find a way of allowing different beliefs to coexist in our society.

'But the judges have sidestepped that big issue, and reinforced the notion that gay rights must trump everything else.

'In
 particular, we are deeply troubled by the remarks of Lady Hale, who 
says rulings by European judges means gay rights are almost untouchable.

'What
 does this mean for other people in Britain who believe in traditional 
marriage - not just Christians, but Muslims, Jews, people of all faiths 
and none?

'We ask Parliament to take a serious look at how Christians with traditional beliefs are being left out in the cold.

'We have no regrets about contesting this case, nor will we ever be ashamed of our beliefs.

'We
 are not perfect people, but we are trying to do our best to live out 
our faith with honesty and consistency. And we will continue to do that,
 come what may.'

The Bulls had accepted an £80-a-night double room booking, believing Steven Preddy, 38, would be staying with his wife.

But when Mr Preddy arrived with his 
46-year-old civil partner Martyn Hall, the men, from Bristol, were told 
they would not be able to share one room and instead had to sleep 
separately.

The Bulls denied
 that they had discriminated against the couple, arguing that their 
policy of only allowing married couples to sleep in a double bed, in 
accordance with their religious beliefs, was applied to everyone, 
regardless of sexual orientation.

They said they had also prevented unmarried heterosexual couples from sharing double rooms since they opened 25 years ago.

Mr Hall and Mr Preddy said they were victims of discrimination.

The
 Bulls have since been forced to close the B&B in September because their 
falling income no longer covered the mortgage on the business they had 
nurtured over three decades.

They
 suffered a drop in bookings following the controversy, which led to 
negative reviews online, their website being hacked, property vandalised
 and receiving death threats.

The Bulls said they thought that any sex outside marriage was 'a sin' - and denied discriminating against Mr Hall and Mr Preddy

Christian Institute spokesman Mike Judge said: 'What this case shows is that the powers of political correctness have reached all the way to the top of the judicial tree. So much so that even the Supreme Court dare not say anything against gay rights.

'Writing the main opinion in the ruling, Lady Hale effectively said gay rights are almost untouchable because of the rulings by European judges.

'Combine that with gay marriage, and it's a recipe for all sorts of threats to people who believe in traditional marriage.

'This ruling is another slap in the face to Christians, and shows that the elite institutions are saturated with a liberal mindset which cares little about religious freedom.

'It should be noted that the one-sided laws which paved the way for this case, the Sexual Orientation Regulations 2007, were voted for by the now Prime Minister David Cameron.

'Parliament needs to reform the law to allow a more reasonable approach which balances competing rights. Otherwise, Christianity will become the belief that dare not speak its name.'
