Soccer star Tim Howard is on a high - and it's not just his stellar World Cup performance that's putting a smile on his face.

The U.S. team's goalkeeper has a new lady love, Scottish investment banker and model Sara McLean, 24.

McLean, who admits she knows close to nothing about soccer, says their connection is about a lot more than sports.

'We don’t really talk about football that much, to be honest. I didn’t even watch football before we started going out,' McLean told The Scottish Sun.

'He just laughs if I ever ask him anything about football.'

Despite the U.S. team's failure to move on past the quarterfinals, McLean says Howard, 35, is 'over the moon with the way he played.'

During the last match against Belgium, he broke the record for most saves in a World Cup match with 16.

According to Page Six, McLean, who came second in the 2011 Miss Scotland Pagaent and later appeared on British reality show Big Brother, met her beau at a party about a year ago.

She couldn't get time off from her London job to go and support her man in Brazil for the World Cup, but says he understands.

And the pair are going to be seeing a lot more of each other over the next four years, after Howard signed a new contract with England's Everton team in a multi-million-dollar deal.

But beauty queen McLean doesn't intend to rest on her laurels and become a WAG.

'I like to work and make my own money,' McLean said. 'I never like to be dependent on anyone.'

The New Jersey-born Howard has a son Jacob, eight, and daughter Ali, seven, who both live with their mother, his ex-wife Laura Liebenrood in Tennessee.

McLean told the Sun that she hasn't ruled out a move to the U.S. after Howard's UK contract ends.

'We’ve spoken about it a couple of times. It would depend on where in life I am, and what opportunities there would be in America for me and my job. We’ll just have to see what happens,' she said.
