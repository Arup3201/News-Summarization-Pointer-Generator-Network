If Australians are feeling frustrated with the speed of their internet it is probably with good reason as the country only ranks 44th in terms of fast access across the world.

New data reveals that the average connection speed dropped 1.8 per cent to 6.9 megabits per second in the third quarter of last year, according to Akamai's State of the Internet report. 

Despite the roll-out of the National Broadband Network, the report states that only two thirds of users will be able to access streaming service, Netflix, which is due to launch across the country on March 31.

Only 66 per cent of Australian users have the 10 to 20 Mbps needed to access the 4K videos used with the streaming services. 

The report says it took an average 4.23 seconds to load a page using broadband and a faster speed of 4.799 seconds when accessing the internet on mobile phones.  

Australia fell to the seventh ranking in terms of speed below its country cousin New Zealand in the Asia Pacific region with the Kiwis experiencing a slighter faster 7 megabits per second on the internet - placing them two spots higher than Australia in the world ranking.

South Korea: 25.3 Mbps

Hong Kong: 16.3Mbps

Japan: 15Mbps

Singapore: 12.2Mbps

Taiwan: 9.5Mbps

New Zealand: 7Mbps

Australia: 6.9Mbps

South Korea easily topped the region with a whopping 25.3 Mbps followed by Hong Kong and Japan with 16.3 and 15Mbps respectively.

Singapore and Taiwan also outdo the Aussies with 12.2 and 9.5Mbps internet speed.

In the third quarter of 2014, the global average connection speed decreased 2.8% to 4.5 Mbps, while the global peak connection speed decreased 2.3% to 24.8 Mbps.

Netflix has already triggered thousands of Australians, who are reportedly accessing foreign versions of Netflix via virtual private network technology, which alters their IP address. 

The world's leading Internet television network has more than 53 million members in nearly 50 countries viewing more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies per month, including original series, documentaries, and feature films. 

The programming for the Australian and New Zealand version of Netflix will include several original series, such as Bloodline starring Ben Mendelsohn and Kyle Chandler, Daredevil and Sense8
