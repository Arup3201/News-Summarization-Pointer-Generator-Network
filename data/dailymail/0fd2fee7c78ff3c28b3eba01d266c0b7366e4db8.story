A wealthy restaurateur has revealed his fears that his elderly heiress wife has been duped by her  personal trainer and long-time assistant in an attempt to steal her fortune.

Athanasios Konidaris, 71, claims that his wife Shelley Upsher Konidaris, 83, has been taken in by her 'Romeo' personal trainer Rex Hughes.

Mrs Konidaris, 83, is one of two heirs to the multimillion-dollar diaper-rash creme Desitin fortune. Her wealth is estimated between $2 and $100million, according to varying lawyers.

Mrs Konidaris decided to begin working out in an effort to look younger, according to court documents filed in Montgomery County Court, philly.com reported.

She began working out with Rex Hughes who her husband claims charged the 83-year-old around $12,000 for just a few workout sessions.

When Mr Konidaris complained, he said that his wife froze him out, changed the locks on their home, asked for a divorce and got a court protection order.

The couple have been married for 25 years, living together in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The couple have ran Zesty's Greek restaurant in Manayunk for two decades.

The restaurant owner claimed that his wife is being duped by Hughes and her 'family office administrator' Beverly Ben-Lulu.

Ms Ben-Lulu has been working for the wealthy octogenarian for many years.

Mr Hughes calls himself a 'fitness professional' and a 'certified Dog Trainer/Recue/Rehabilitator' on  social media sites.

He claims to be from Fort Lauderdale, Florida and lives in New York City. His Facebook relationship status is listed as 'it's complicated'.

Mr Konidaris' lawyer Bruce Castor said that his client has been falsely accused of harming his wife.

Mr Castor told MailOnline today: 'Weâ€™re
just trying to get at the truth here. Who might have a motive to want to
take advantage of Shelley?

'And if there are such people, are they the
ones supporting the false claim our client is a bad man?'

Mrs Konidaris's attorney Mary T. 
Vidas, denied her client paid Mr Hughes $12,000 and said that Mr 
Konidaris is inventing the alleged scam, according to philly.com.

She
 claims that Mr Konidaris subjected his wife to verbal abuse and was 
'obsessed' with becoming the sole heir to her fortune.  According to 
Montgomery County Court records, the 71-year-old has complaints 
stretching from 2009 in relation to his restaurant and from credit card 
companies.

Ms Vidas refused to comment on pending litigation today.

The diaper-cream heiress is worth between $2mlillion and $100million dollars (according to various lawyers)
