A Belgian Shepherd dog born with two noses, who was struggling to find a new home because of his rare defect, is set to begin a new life after offers to adopt him flooded in from around the globe.

Five-month-old Snuffles had previously been rejected by four owners and was in the care of the Dog's 
Trust Rehoming Centre in Uddingston, Glasgow.

But after issuing an appeal, the centre received 40 messages and 20 calls from people in the USA and South Africa, as well as Britain.

Happy tail: Snuffles, the dog with two noses, has finally found a new owner

Looking up: Snuffles will begin a new life next week after finding an owner from East Lothian

Supportive: Staff at the care home gave him the endearing name because of his odd appearance

Pamela Jackson from the centre, told The Mirror: 'Some families just turned up hoping to adopt him.

'We wanted to pick the best home for him.

'The eventual new owner took him for a walk to get to know him and they got on brilliantly.

'He said Snuffles was perfect and everything he was looking for.'

Snuffles was born with a rare congenital defect which gives him the appearance of having two noses.

Vet Angela McAllister explained: 'Instead of his nostrils being fused together he's got some sort of split there.

'It's
 a defect in his palate which gives him the appearance of having two 
noses as his nostrils can move completely independently of each other.

'I've never seen the condition in my 20-year career.'

To add to his unique appearance, Snuffles can also move both noses independently of each other.

The centre's manager Sandra Lawton said: 'He may not have been blessed with the looks of Lassie but he has a heart of  gold and really can claim to be a dog in several million.'

Snuffles will begin his new life with a family from East Lothian next week.

Rare: Snuffles was born with an unusual defect to his nose

Obedient: Staff at the centre say Snuffles would be a perfect dog to train

Young: Snuffles is only five months old, but has already been re-homed four times

The deformed calf which was born with two heads in Morocco

The piglet from Changtai County in southern China's Fujian Province was born with three eyes and two mouths

In December, a village in northern Morocco was shocked by the birth of a two-headed calf.

The young animal was named Sana Saida, which means 'Happy New Year' in Arabic.

After its birth, the creature attracted a lot of attention, with 
locals of Sefrou, a village less than 20 miles from Fez, flocking to the
 farm to see it.

The calf is known as polycephalic, which means having more than one head.

Just a few days earlier, a two-headed piglet came into the world among a litter of 10 that was born in Nanchang, capital of eastern China's Jiangxi Province.

Unfortunately for the animal, vets said it would find it very hard to survive with the mutation.

In June, the San Antonio Zoo in Texas also welcomed a bizarre addition - a two-headed turtle they named Thelma and Louise.

The
 female Texas cooter was born with four others on June 18 displayed at the zoo's Friedrich Aquarium - swimming and walking as 
normally as her one-headed brothers and sisters.

The condition is supposedly common among snakes and turtles.

In 2011, a piglet from Changtai County in southern China's Fujian Province was been born with three eyes and two mouths. 

Xiao
 Jintu, owner of a local pig farm, said the piglet was one from a 
12-strong litter.

'It came out 5th and I was stunned in seeing its 
appearance', he said.

In 2009, a snake with two heads was 
found in a drawer full of rubbish in the US, while a cat suffering the 
same deformity was born in Australia a year earlier.

In 2008, Fisherman Christopher Johnson found a pregnant bull shark in the Indian Ocean.

When he cut it's stomach open, he found a foetus of a two-headed baby inside.

Scientists said it was the first time the condition has been seen in a shark.
