You would think that after nearly 18 years as a unit, these quintuplets would relish the opportunity to do off to explore the world of college studies on their own, but you could not be more wrong.

Maria, Emilio, John, George and Enna Diaz, 17, from Keller, Texas, have always been together, and as they have all been accepted to the same college, they can continue to do so – at least until graduation day.

They were born just seconds apart in the space of three minutes on July 14, 1996, the first ever quints to be born in Houston.

As they prepare to graduate from their
 local high school, the quints explain that the bond shared between 
siblings of multiple births is not a myth.

The quints claim to ‘read each other’s mind’ and frequently have similar dreams or hum the same songs.

‘Sometimes
 we have the same dream. It's like, “Oh my goodness! That's weird... I 
kinda had the same dream!”,’ George explains to KVUE.com.

They
 joke that the only time they are separate are when they shower. They 
share the same friends, compete in the same school sports, and when it 
came to their high school prom they took each other.

‘The age difference between us is like 30 seconds between each of us,,’ Enna added. ‘From like me to Maria it's about three minutes.’

All for one: When it came to college applications, there was no way the quints would let this split them up, and they are all attending the same university

Sharing is caring: The Diaz family meals are always big and busy, and even more so as the quintuplets have grown older

How time flies: The five Diaz children have always been close, a bond they have no intention to break

Sister act: Enna is the oldest and Maria is the youngest, born just three minutes later on July 14, 1996

As
 the first Houston quintuplets, their birth was well documented by local
 news, and the first time Enna Snr saw her babies was on the news, 
watching the television from her hospital bed as she recovered.

‘I said, “Oh my God, those are my kids!” They are so pretty, and I start crying and crying,’ Mrs Diaz recalls.

Maria,
 Emilio, John, George and Enna are all going to be attending University 
of North Texas in the fall, and despite the fact that financing five 
college kids all at once looks near-impossible on paper, they are 
determined to go – all together.

The
 Diaz quintuplets have all applied for financial aid, grants and 
scholarships so that all five of them can live out their dream and get 
their degrees.

‘I want to major in business marketing,’ Emilio said.

Staying close: The quins share the same friends and also compete in the same sports at school

Common goal: The siblings are determined to make college work despite the financial difficulty and have all applied for grants and scholarships
