The Spanish press has laid into Real Madrid, and in particular the world's two most expensive players, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, after their defeat to Barcelona on Sunday.

AS showed a picture of Ronaldo missing from four yards, with the headline 'they missed and they paid for it', while Marca went with Bale's reaction and the line 'so many misses'.

Both Madrid-based papers emphasise Real's superiority during the game, with AS claiming they 'dominated while Modric lasted', and attacking Bale for 'failing again'.

Marca went even further, refusing to give the Welshman a mark in their player ratings. He scored 4.5, the lowest of all the players, from AS.

Marc were more kind to the rest of the Real players, claiming Madrid 'overwhelmed Barca for 45 minutes, don’t finish them off and end up against the ropes'.

Both papers also feature Spaniards playing in England on their front pages, with Juan Mata's spectacular volley at Anfield, and Diego Costa's withdrawal from the Spain squad, making the headlines. 

However, elsewhere in Spain, in the Barcelona-based papers in particular, the focus was on the gap Luis Enrique's team have opened up at the top of La Liga.

Sport label the result a blow to Madrid, while Mundo Deportivo describe it as a 'two-faced Clasico' which saw Barca move four points clear.

 In Italy the focus was on Carlos Tevez, who scored a stunning goal to keep Juventus winning.

The Serie A champions beat Genoa thanks to the former Manchester City and United striker, leading Corriere dello Sport to observe it is 'always Tevez'.
