Wigan have assured Ben Flower his job is safe despite the Wales prop’s six-month ban for punching Lance Hohaia of St Helens in the Grand Final.

Flower will miss 13 games for the attack that left Wigan a man short for 78 minutes of Super League’s showpiece game - which St Helens won 14-6 at Old Trafford on Saturday.

But Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan dismissed suggestions that Flower, 26, could be sacked for his moment of madness.

‘There is absolutely no question of us sacking Ben Flower,’ said Lenagan.

‘Ben made a mistake, and let anyone who hasn’t made a mistake stand forward. This is not drug taking, it’s behaving irresponsibly in a super-charged emotional environment.

‘That’s no reason to sack a player. That’s a reason to discipline him and make sure he suffers from it because we as a club have suffered as well obviously, and quite rightly so because we are responsible for our players.

‘A six-month ban is exceptional and the public criticism of Ben has hurt him very hard, rightly though.’

Flower has since been given a six-month suspension for the incident in Saturday's final at Old Trafford

Greater Manchester Police are continuing to investigate death threats made against Flower on Twitter.

Lenagan said: 'I think death threats are crazy in the circumstances, when the victim himself is making clear his position. You always get extremists, particularly associated with sport.'

Hohaia has said he holds no ill feeling towards Flower.
