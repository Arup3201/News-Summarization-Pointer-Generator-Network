Tottenham have been rebuffed in an initial attempt to offer Gylfi Sigurdsson in return for Swansea's Ben Davies and Michel Vorm.

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is looking to introduce some new faces at White Hart Lane following his arrival from Southampton this summer, and he sees Davies and Vorm as ideal additions to his squad.

Spurs target: Pochettino wants to sign Davies before the start of the Premier League season

Exchange: Daniel Levy has offered Sigurdsson for Davies and Dutch international Vorm

Left-back Davies enjoyed a good season for the Welsh side as they finished 12th in the Premier League under Garry Monk, with Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins valuing the Englishman at Â£10million.

Jenkins is said to be interested in taking Sigurdsson back to the Liberty Stadium, hence Spurs' cheeky exchange offer for Davies and Vorm.

Sigurdsson enjoyed a successful five-month loan spell at Swansea back in 2012.

The north London club's approach for Holland international Vorm raises questions about the future of first-choice goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, with the France No 1 a long-term target of Paris Saint-Germain.
