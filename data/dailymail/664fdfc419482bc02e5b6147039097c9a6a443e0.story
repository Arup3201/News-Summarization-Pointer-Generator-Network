Amateur footballers once traditionally confined to the trappings of a local park or small stadium can now play the beautiful game amid the skyscrapers of a bustling Chinese city.

These spectacular pictures show a game of five-a-side being played on a football pitch which is built on the roof of a shopping mall.

The artificial pitch was constructed in the heart of Jinhua, in China's Zhejiang province, after widespread development left the city centre with no green space.

Instead of creating another pitch located outside the grasp of inner-city commuters, developers decided to build it on the roof of a downtown shopping centre.

The pitch is surrounded by high wire fencing, inside which players can enjoy the game without fear of losing the ball down in the streets below.

But only a short barrier is in place to separate spectators from a terrifying fall should they wander too close to the edge.

The construction of the pitch has proved popular with downtown office workers, who previously had no nearby pitch to play on.

Five-a-side games are now regularly played on the pitch and a tournament was held on New Year's Day.
