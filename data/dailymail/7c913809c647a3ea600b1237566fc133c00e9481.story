A school has sent letters of apology to parents after 11-year-old pupils were given homework containing graphic references to a man’s severed penis.

The Year 7 pupils at Mortimer Community College in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, were told in an assignment to read an extract from 1996 travel book Notes from a Small Island by Bill Bryson.

But the relevant part of the book referred to the famous 1993 case of US couple John and Lorena Bobbit, saying how the wife ‘cuts off her husband's d*** and flings it out the window in a fit of pique’.

One parent described the homework assignment as ‘disgusting’, claiming the passage was packed with ‘filthy innuendos’ - but the school said the homework had been given out by mistake.

Headmistresses Claire Mullane said: ‘This was a mistake. A member of staff had asked the students to read the extract but had not read it herself first.

‘She was supposed to have picked out a specific paragraph for the pupils to read rather than the whole extract. We in no way condone that sort of approach, however it was an error.’

The extract - part of 11 pages taken from the Bill Bryson book - made reference to the case of Mr and Mrs Bobbit, which hit the headlines 21 years ago when she sliced off his penis with an 8in knife.

Specific extracts from books by Mr Bryson are used by many schools as part of English lessons.

Consider how much news space in Britain is devoted to marginal American figures like Oliver North, Lorena Bobbitt, and OJ. Simpson - a man who played a sport that most Britons don't understand and then made commercials for rental cars and that was it - and compare that with all the news reported in any year from  Scandinavia,  Austria, Switzerland, Greece,  Portugal and Spain. It's crazy really. If there's a political crisis in Italy or a nuclear spill in Karlsruhe, it gets maybe eight inches on an inside page. But if some woman in S***kicker, West Virginia, cuts off her husband's d*** and flings it out the window in a fit of pique, it's second lead on the 9 O'clock News and The Sunday Times is mobilizing the 'Insight' team. You figure it.

Mrs Mullane, 62, added: ‘Once we were aware of what had happened, we acted on it immediately and spoke to the class in question and apologised to them.

‘Myself and the member of staff have now written to parents of the pupils concerned and they should have received those letters at the weekend.’

One mother, whose child was given the homework, said: ‘I was disgusted that she came home with this. I appreciate the school apologised - but, in my eyes, the damage is done because the kids have read it now.

‘The headteacher said the extract should not have been included in the 11 pages given out.

'The whole thing was full of filthy innuendos. How the Government can say this is acceptable to use in school is beyond me.

‘What other people do in their homes with their children is entirely up to them, but my child does not hear anything like this at home. I’m mortified she has been spoon fed this from a teacher.’

Ofsted's last inspection of the school in December 2012 found it was 'good' - an improvement from its previous rating in 2010 of 'satisfactory'. It caters for almost 850 pupils aged between 11 and 16.

In 1993, Ecuadorian-born Lorena Bobbitt was 24 and working as a manicurist in Manassas, Virginia while enduring physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband John Wayne Bobbitt.

On June 23, 1993, he returned from a night of drinking and started to row with his then-wife. Mrs Bobbitt later told authorities that he raped her, but he was acquitted of the alleged attack.

After he fell asleep, she went out to the kitchen and picked up an 8in knife before returning to the bedroom and slicing off his penis. She says the night was 'a blur'.

Leaving him bleeding in their bed, she then jumped in the car and drove off, throwing the severed penis out of the window into a field.

But moments later, she realised the severity of what she had done and alerted 911. A painstaking search uncovered his penis before doctors worked for nine hours to reattach it.

This year marks 20 years since she was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Jurors agreed an 'irresistible impulse' provoked by abuse led her to attack her husband.

Mrs Bobbitt is now living in Gainesville, Virginia, where she works in real estate, enjoys zumba and raises money for women's shelters. She has an eight-year-old daughter with a partner of 16 years.

Her ex-husband found that the surgeons' work to reattach his severed pens had been a success and he starred in a few pornographic films, including 'John Wayne Bobbitt Uncut'.

In an interview last year, Mr Bobbitt claimed he had slept with around 70 women since the attack.

But his celebrity lifestyle caught up with him and in 1994 he was jailed for 15 days for assaulting his then-fiance Kristina Elliott. They never married.

He went on to marry two other women - a businesswoman in 2001 to whom he was wed for just 23 days, and a woman in 2002. The latter marriage ended after two years.
