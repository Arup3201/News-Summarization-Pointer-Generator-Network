A diversion that takes motorists on a 47-mile detour to avoid roadworks just a few hundred yards long was today branded 'laughable'.

Drivers who want to travel through the centre of Highbridge, Somerset, will need to reconsider their route from Monday.

The huge diversion, which has been put in place by Somerset County Council so 740 yards of road can be resurfaced, is scheduled to last for eight working days.

The staggering 47-mile detour was today labelled Britain's longest diversion.

It has left local residents baffled since it directs motorists on a huge journey taking almost two hours.

Phil Harvey, Burnham and Highbridge town
councillor, today hit out at the county council for authorising roadworks that will cause such lengthy delays.

He said: 'This has to qualify as the UK’s longest-ever 
diversion route caused by such a minor set of roadworks.

'It is just laughable that 
Somerset County Council really expects motorists to drive almost 50 
miles across the region to avoid a few hundred metres of road.

'There are plenty of shorter, more sensible, local routes to take.'

Motorists approaching Highbridge from the
south will from Monday see road signs directing them to turn around away from Church Street and go back along 
the A38 to Pawlett.

The half-mile stretch of road will be closed for just over a week

They are then told to drive inland along the A39 to Glastonbury and 
Wells before travelling north to Axbridge along the A371 to Rodney 
Stoke, before picking up the A38 at East Brent and travelling southbound 
back to Highbridge.

Google’s online mapping facility 
calculates that the diversion is 47.1miles long and will take drivers 
around 1 hour, 43 minutes to complete - considerably longer than the 30 
seconds it usually takes to drive along the 680metres of Church Street 
that will be temporarily closed.

But Eileen Shaw, Burnham and Highbridge town clerk, said: 'The alternative route might look extreme.

'It is being put in place by the 
county council to try and divert motorists, particularly those with 
heavy goods vehicles, away from minor roads with weak bridges.'

A Somerset County Council spokesman said: ‘It does seem ridiculous that legally the council has to put this lengthy diversion in place.

‘In reality we all know that locals will find alternative short routes and lorry drivers will use sat nav and use the motorway.

‘We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused but it is only for a short period and only affects the few.’
