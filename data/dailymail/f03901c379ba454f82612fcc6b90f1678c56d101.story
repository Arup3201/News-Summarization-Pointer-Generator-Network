There's a print of a monkey’s head on Neil Fachie’s cycling helmet but, after gorging himself on gold, the Aberdonian would be perfectly entitled to consider a portrait of something faster.

Fachie and pilot Craig MacLean combine the darting speed of a gazelle with the brute strength of a big cat and, against even their own expectations, pooled their resources to dig out their second gold of these games in the Sprint B Tandem.

Known as the ‘Power Monkey’ for his perky persona and physical fortitude, there’s no aping around when Fachie climbs on his bike. The partially-sighted cyclist is already a World and Paralympic champion and now he and McLean can call themselves double Commonwealth champions and Scotland’s first multiple gold winners of 2014.

Pride: Neil Fachie and pilot Craig MacLean celebrate after winning the tandem final on Saturday

This latest success was hardearned and somewhat unexpected.

Fachie,
 30, tweeted before the final that the odds were against the Scots and 
he looked worryingly correct after the first leg of the final against 
Australians Kieran Modra and Jason Niblett.

‘The
 morning session was such a struggle for us, we were just so fatigued 
from yesterday,’ said Fachie as he soaked up the acclaim of the crowd in
 the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome.

‘Qualifying
 didn’t go that well and I felt absolutely awful after it. We got 
through the semi-final and it was a real effort. The Aussies were 
flying, they killed us in qualifying, and I knew they had a lot they 
could use against us.

‘They are such a talented team and I knew it was going to be a struggle. The first ride proved that and I have no idea where we found what we did at the end.

‘It just comes down to the crowd. Without them I doubt we’d have done it.’

After
 Friday’s heroics in the 1,000 metres time trial, Fachie was not alone 
in fearing there would be a toll on the duo’s legs, and the suspicion 
lingered when they qualified for the final slower than Modra and 
Niblett.

Beaten a little too
 comfortably in that first race of the final, gold looked a forlorn hope
 until a heroically strong finish in the second
 left them with a shot in the decider. Who knows what alchemy occurs 
when the roar of an expectant home crowd transfuses energy into an 
athlete’s legs but by the end of the decider they had streaked ahead to a
 rapturous reception.

Shots fired: Fachie points out to the vociferous Glasgow crowd following the win

Sir 
Chris was in the commentary gantry to see his former team-mate MacLean 
claim another medal but it was to his family that the 42-year-old made a
 beeline at the end.

‘At the
 Melbourne Games I was in deep trouble for not going up to the stands 
and saying hello to my family,’ he revealed. ‘I have kids
 here now, and it’s very special having them in the crowd. It was extra 
special to do it front of a predominantly Scottish audience. It’s not 
often you get to do that and it means a lot as potentially it’s the last
 time I will do this in my career.

‘I am not retiring just yet but I am not going to see another Commonwealth Games, certainly not in Scotland.’

The

 night before Billy Connolly provided the celebrity support and this 
time there was royalty in attendance in the form of Prince Edward. 
Still, Fachie hopes his achievements reach a wider audience than the 
4,000 or so in attendance.

Comeback: The Scottish pair had to come from 1-0 down in the best-of-three final to win

‘You
 don’t really consider yourself inspirational but it is nice when people
 come up to you,’ he added.

‘There are so many people with visual 
impairments in Scotland and the UK and the sad thing is we only have two
 British bikes here and there is not even an English tandem.

‘There are so many people who could be taking up the opportunity and if anyone is inspired by me to do that then I am happy.’

Earlier, there was disappointment for Katie Archibald who was tipped for a medal in the 10km scratch race, but finished fifth as

Australia’s Annette Edmondson took gold.

Archibald
 will go again in the 25km points race, her favoured event. ‘I guess I 
was in a prime position at the end and it just didn’t happen,’ reflected
 the 20-year-old Sportsmail columnist.

‘The
 scratch race is such a short event that you’ve really only got one 
chance at it, whereas the points race I feel it’s always the strongest rider who comes out on top.’
