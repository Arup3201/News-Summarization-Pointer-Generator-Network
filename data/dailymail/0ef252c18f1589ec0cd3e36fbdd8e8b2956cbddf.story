Tenderloin of wild venison sounds tasty and badger curry could be a rather interesting dish.

A Plymouth doctor, Austin Hunt, boasted about feeding his family roadkill. He said he had created dishes such as badget balti and tenderloin of wild venison

However, one’s appetite for them might be tempered by the fact that the meat for both was provided by dead animals left on the road.

They are two of the meals cooked up by surgeon Austin Hunt – who regularly manages to feed his family with roadkill.

But his unorthodox recipes have prompted a warning from police officers.

They have cautioned the public not to copy his actions, claiming that eating roadkill can put people at risk of poisoning.

Mr Hunt has revealed his passion for turning mangled animal carcasses into tasty, nutritious dishes including tenderloin of wild venison and badger curry.

The consultant in acute medicine and renal failure serves his ‘free, ethical,’ food to his three children as well as dinner party guests.

Mr Hunt began his culinary adventure by taking home a dead badger.

His children – aged nine, seven and four – looked on as he butchered the male animal and made it into a curry, despite the fact that his wife Sally is a strict vegetarian.

He said of the process: ‘The effort required to produce edible flesh from roadkill is considerable, and skinning an old boar badger demands a technique akin to chiselling.

‘For some days, thick black bristles were still turning up on the kitchen surfaces – much to the fury of my vegetarian wife.

‘I opted to serve the badger in a curry sauce, persuading myself that no dangerous microbes could survive seven hours of slow casseroling with a ton of spices.’

He went on to say: ‘In truth, the flesh resembled some dodgy meat substitute from a long-expired Army ration pack, and despite the lengthy cooking it remained tooth-breakingly tough.

'All seven guests at our roadkill initiation evening tried the main course – eventually – although only two came back for seconds.

‘Our curried badger might not have been the best dish ever served at a dinner party, but it was certainly the most talked about.’

Mr Hunt, who works at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon,  and lives on Dartmoor, revealed  that he now regularly eats deer he finds on the side of the road, even offering bottles of wine to colleagues who tip him off about the presence of a carcass.

He believes that roadkill has improved his diet, saved him money and is helping to broaden his children’s minds.

Mr Hunt added: ‘A deer carcass provides around £300 worth of prime meat, and distributing this among friends results in plenty of return dinner invitations.

‘Roadkill venison is also an ethical food and a number of usually vegetarian friends have eschewed their principles on occasion because they are happy to eat meat obtained in this way.’

While picking up roadkill is not illegal in Britain, it is illegal to take home an animal if you have knocked it down yourself.

However Devon and Cornwall Police said motorists could be putting their health at risk by eating their roadside finds.

Wildlife officer Sergeant Ryan Canning said police are frequently called out to collisions between cars and deer and the resulting meat would not be suitable to eat.

He explained: ‘You may have driven down that road an hour before and returned to find the carcass of a deer, but sometimes police and a vet have already been and gone and such a find would not in any way be fit for human consumption.

‘There are occasions where a zoo or educational organisation has come out to remove an already deceased carcass.

‘However I would strongly urge people to be cautious. Make sure that you know the absolute full history of the death of an animal before you think about taking it home, cooking and eating it.’

He added: ‘Please do not just assume that it died as a result of being struck by a vehicle.’
