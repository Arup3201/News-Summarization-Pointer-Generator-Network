If your walls are covered in your child’s drawings, they may be worth a closer look.

Because artistic talent early in life provides an indicator of intelligence later on, scientists have found.

Children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, according to a paper published today.

Psychologists at King’s College London studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four-year-olds. Those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later.

Children who can depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, a study by King's College London has found. Drawings of more than 15,000 children were graded for the study

Each drawing was given a grade between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The scoring system ignored features such as proportion for the study

The research, conducted on 7,750 pairs of identical and non-identical twins, also found a strong link between genetics and artistic talent. 

Identical twins were much more likely to draw pictures of a similar quality than non-identical twins.

Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life.

‘Through drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what’s in our mind. 

'This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species’ ability to store information and build a civilisation.’

However, she added: ‘But this does not mean parents need to worry. It is really important that parents do not think, “Oh no, my child is terrible at drawing, they will be flipping burgers for the rest of their life.”

Each drawing was given a mark out of ten. The one on the left was given a four while the one on the right a ten

More than 15,000 children, all aged four, were asked to draw a picture of a child for the King's College study

There are countless factors, both genetic and environmental, which affect intelligence in later life.

‘Drawing ability does not determine intelligence. The findings show there is a link, but it is only a moderate link.’

The children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child. Each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. 

The scoring system ignored features such as proportion, but the children were given a point for including clothing.

The children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing, and again at the age of 14.

The researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores.

While some drawings received a 0 (left), others were marked up because of their knowledge of features (right)

Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London (pictured), said of the study: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life'

Dr Arden added: ‘There is no evidence that drawing makes you more intelligent. But I think drawing will make a child more observant and able to pay attention to what is around them.

‘Children love drawing; give them a crayon and let them get on with it.’

Her team also tested the link between genes and artistic talent, using twins because each pair has a similar background, allowing the scientists to disregard outside influences. 

'Overall, drawings from identical twin pairs were more similar to one another than drawings from non-identical twin pairs.

Dr Arden said: ‘This does not mean there is a drawing gene – a child’s ability to draw stems from many other abilities, such as observing. 

'We are a long way off understanding how genes influence all these different types of behaviour.’

The research is published in the journal Psychological Science.
