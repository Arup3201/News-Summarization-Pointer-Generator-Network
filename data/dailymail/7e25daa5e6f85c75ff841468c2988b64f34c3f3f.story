The NHS is to hold an inquiry into whistleblowing over claims that a ‘culture of fear’ still stops staff exposing poor care.

Sir Robert Francis, the barrister who ran the public inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, will chair the probe.

Sir Robert said that since publishing his findings 16 months ago into the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients at Mid Staffs, many staff had contacted him saying they were still too scared to speak out.

The announcement is a victory for the Mail, which has repeatedly highlighted how whistleblowers have been victimised for raising the alarm over poor standards and cover-ups.

They include Dr Raj Mattu, who fought a 13-year battle to clear himself of wrongdoing, and Gary Walker, the chief executive paid £500,000 to keep quiet about the target-driven culture at United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust.

Sir Robert said that although the Mid Staffordshire report had driven the NHS to be more open, many staff were still too afraid to raise concerns.

‘It’s significant to say that since the inquiry, I’ve had a lot of people talk to me about a culture of fear that prevents people from speaking out,’ he said. ‘Every time a whistleblower is treated badly, many people will be deterred from doing the right thing. That’s one of the things we’ve got to change quickly.

‘Where those brave enough to speak out have been victimised, I’d like to look at what more could be done to remedy the wrongs which have been done.’

He has contacted whistleblowers whose cases have already come to light and will interview them on their experiences.

Other NHS staff who have been victimised will be urged to get in touch through a dedicated website.

Hospitals are being urged to make patients watch  airline-style safety videos under plans announced by Health  Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

The two-minute films would tell people arriving on wards how to take simple precautions to avoid infections, falls, pressure sores  and dehydration. 

They would also encourage patients to wear bed stockings to avoid blood clots, ask staff whether they had washed their hands and tell nurses if they do not know how to take medication.

The move is part of series of measures announced yesterday by Mr Hunt to make hospitals safer and encourage staff to be honest when mistakes occur.

Sir Robert is hoping to publish a report in November that will set out what the Health Service needs to do to encourage staff to draw attention to poor care.

The barrister, who specialises in medical negligence, spent two and a half years chairing the inquiry into failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust that took place between 2005 and 2009. His report last February made 290 recommendations for the NHS and prompted key changes.

Helene Donnelly, a former A&E nurse at Mid Staffordshire who now advises the Department of Health on whistleblowing, said: ‘As we speak there are staff and patients suffering.

‘We need to ensure staff feel truly able to raise concerns without fear of victimisation and that they will be listened to.’

Jennie Fecitt, a nurse who set up the group Patients First, said it had been ‘inundated’ by NHS staff who had been victimised for speaking out.

She was forced out of her own job at a walk-in centre in Manchester after raising concerns about a doctor, and will be giving evidence to Sir Robert’s inquiry.

She said: ‘You’re very alone when you blow the whistle. When you raise concerns about patient safety in the NHS, the organisation takes this up as an employment issue.

‘They then find a way of exiting that person. They either get removed over capability issues, on employment issues or they are just made redundant.

Dr Raj Mattu: The leading cardiologist was sacked from Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry for exposing that patients were dying in overcrowded bays.

Managers spent 13 years pursuing him through employment tribunals, but in April this year he was cleared of any wrongdoing and a tribunal ruled he had been unfairly dismissed.

Gary Walker: He was forced out as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust in 2010 after warning that managers  were more obsessed with targets than patients.

The trust made him sign a £500,000 gagging clause, which he broke last year. Managers are now trying to claw the money back.

Sandra Haynes Kirkbright: Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was suspended by Royal  Wolverhampton Hospitals Trust in March after accusing the trust of fiddling its death rate figures.

She worked as a ‘clinical coder’ – recording patient deaths and illnesses – and claimed that staff in the same role were ‘breaking every rule in the book.’

David Ore: The security manager lost his job after exposing how staff at Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust were locking up elderly patients and children for 12 hours without food or drink.

Last month police launched an investigation – one elderly man is believed to have died due to ‘unreasonable force.’
