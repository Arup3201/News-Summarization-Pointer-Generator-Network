Prince Harry is due to deploy to the frontline in Afghanistan at the controls of an Apache helicopter after passing a rigorous training course with flying colours.

He even claimed one of two best young airman awards as he qualified to crew the fearsome gunship.

The 27-year-old Prince is likely to be sent to the warzone to fight the Taliban – and will join the Apache unit which has the highest 'kill rate' in Afghanistan. He could be re-deployed as early as this autumn.

Harry – Captain Wales of the Army Air
Corps – gained two passes at A-Level: a B in art and a D in geography.

He is said to be ‘delighted’ to have qualified as a Top Gun pilot 
and has exceeded even his own expectations.

In an interview a few years 
ago he admitted he felt he wasn’t bright enough for the role.

But sources said he amazed his instructors with his ‘natural and instinctive’ flying talent.

‘Trust me, he wouldn’t be put in charge of one of those helicopters if he wasn’t up to it,’ said a senior military source.

Officers were so impressed with his aptitude for flying the £46million helicopter that he was handed the prize of top Co-pilot Gunner on his 18-month course.

One of two crew in an Apache, the Co-pilot Gunner commands the mission, fires the weapons, navigates and sometimes takes over the controls.

He received his trophy – a polished 30mm round from an Apache cannon mounted on a stand – at a dinner at Wattisham Air Station near Ipswich, where he completed his training.

Colonel Neale Moss, the Apache Force Commander, said: ‘The course is extremely challenging, teaching and testing students in their flying skills, decision-making and mental agility.’

Harry has been assigned to 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps.

His ‘Limited Combat Ready’ status means he has proven himself in advanced mountain flying and desert training to prepare him for Afghanistan’s terrain.

Part of his course included two months of advanced weapons training in California and Arizona, where the desert conditions replicate those found in Afghanistan.

He will now spend at least eight months flying Apaches on exercises in the UK.

The gunship - nicknamed the ‘flying tank’ - has been used by UK forces in Afghanistan to smash the Taliban, gather intelligence and provide support for soldiers on the ground and Chinook troop-carrying helicopters.

Boasting a top speed of 161mph, the 
helicopter is so sophisticated it can detect, classify and prioritise up
to 256 potential targets in seconds.

It is so quick, fearsome and manoeuvrable that Afghan insurgents have dubbed it the ‘mosquito’ - because its bite is lethal.

Military commanders singled out the 
Apaches for special praise for helping defeat Colonel Gaddafi’s troops 
when they were deployed to the decks of HMS Ocean during the Libya 
conflict.

Forces loyal to the dictator were terrified of being targeted by the fast-moving choppers - preventing them targeting pro-democracy rebels.

Harry is keen to return to Afghanistan after his first tour of duty was cut short in 2008.

He was secretly deployed to Helmand Province with the Household Cavalry and worked as a forward air controller directing bombing strikes against the Taliban for ten weeks.

But his time there was cut short when news of his presence leaked out and he was brought back to Britain.

As a result, he decided to retrain as an Army Air Corp helicopter pilot in the hope that it would increase his chances of being redeployed.

Last April, while training for an Arctic expedition, he suggested it would be pointless to undertake costly helicopter training if he never went into combat.

He said: ‘You become a very expensive asset, the training’s very expensive and they wouldn’t have me doing what I’m doing.

‘I’d just be taking up a spare place for somebody else if they didn’t have me going out on the job.’He said he would love to return to Afghanistan with ‘his brothers in arms’.

The £46million helicopter gunship is very difficult to fly - and only the very best pilots ever complete the training course.

With a top speed of 161mph the Apache is relatively slow - but the onboard systems are so sophisticated it can classify and prioritise up to 256 potential targets in seconds.

Yet the helicopter is so difficult to master that some of the very best pilots are never able to fly it.

The training is spread over 16 months - and Harry must still spend a further eight months flying the helicopters in the UK before he can be deployed despite completing the course.

The two pilots sit one behind the other and it is usually the front person who is the mission commander. Harry, as the second pilot, will be in the back seat which gives better visibility.

The army own 67 Apaches and have 55 crews of two pilots. They have become the aircraft of choice for fighting the Taliban.

Most of the information from the sensors and radars appears in front of the pilot's right eye on the 'Helmet Display Unit'.

The main weapons on the gunship are a 30mm cannon firing 625 rounds a minute, CRV-7 'point-and-fire' rockets and four air-to-air missiles.

Night-flying is particularly challenging as rather than using night-vision goggles, pilots rely on forward looking infra-red which creates a video-screen picture of what lies ahead.
