A New York City executive dumped twice by his ex-fiance has settled a lawsuit he had brought against her after claiming she owed him tens of thousands of dollars in deposits and reservations for their wedding that never was.

The second time Kendra Platt-Lee, a 28-year-old ex-Hooters girl, broke up with Steven Silverstein, 30, she did it by phone from 2,800 miles away - hours after withdrawing $54,000 from their joint back account.

Mr Silverstein was demanding nearly $50,000 from his former flame - $19,000 from the bank account withdrawal, $14,000 for half of the rent he paid while they were living together and $13,500 for half of the deposits he put down for the wedding.

Closure: Steven Silverstein has settled his legal dispute with ex-fiance Kendra Platt-Lee who called off their wedding in April 2012 six months before the big day

Ms Platt-Lee had contested her ex’s claims, insisting she had paid her share. She claimed their  
relationship had ended 'amicably' after she sent him back her $32,000 diamond wedding ring in May 2012.

Silverstein’s lawyer, Elliott Martin, 
confirmed to the Daily News that the case was settled last month, but said the monetary details were 
confidential.

The two met aboard a cross-country flight in 2008. He was a high-flying account executive for AT&T and she was a stewardess. He swept her off her feet and convinced her to move across the country from San Diego, California, to New York. 

In March 2008, they started dating and got engaged in August 2009.

Pricey: The pair had put down a deposit of more than $16,000 to reserve The Allegria Hotel in Long Beach, New York, for their proposed wedding in front of 150 guests

By then, they were living together and Mr Silverstein was paying the rent on their $2,595-a-month apartment.

In February 2010, Ms Platt-Lee dumped Mr Silverstein and moved out of the apartment. The cause of the breakup is unknown.

About 15 months later, in June 2011, Mr Silverstein won her back. She moved back in and they decided to get married.

For
their engagement, he gave her a $32,000 diamond ring and they moved 
into an even ritzier love nest -- for $3,945 a month -- with Mr 
Silverstein paying the bills.

They had planned an upscale wedding at 
the The Allegria Hotel in Long Beach on Long Island. Mr Silverstein had 
claimed they split $16,000 to reserve it for the September 22, 2012 
wedding.

Mr Silverstein also claimed he had personally paid $27,000 to reserve a wedding band, deejay and photographer.

He claims they had agreed to each pay half the cost of the wedding and that Ms Platt-Lee had agreed to eventually pay him back her share.

Then things went sour. On April 13, 2012 Ms Platt-Lee went back home to California for a 'one-week visit.'

After ten days, she withdrew more than $54,000 from their joint checking account. Mr Silverstein says only $35,000 of that money was hers.

Later that day, she called her New York City beau and ended the relationship.
