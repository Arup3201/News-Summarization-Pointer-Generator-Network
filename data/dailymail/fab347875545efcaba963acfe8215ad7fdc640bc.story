One of Australia’s most iconic photographers has released a stunning new set of images, capturing the sunburnt country in a series of glorious panoramic shots.

Ken Duncan has been working as a professional photographer for 35 years, but still considers himself an average photographer- who happens to be blessed with an amazing job.

However, as his new book shows, his ability capture the spirit of a place and tell a story with the beautiful images he creates, proves his titles as one of Australia’s most accomplished and pioneering photographers. 

'Reggie's Hut', taken in Burra, South Australia is one of the many stunning photographs which tell the story of Australia 

'Glass House Rocks', taken in Narooma, NSW: Mr Duncan said that his love and appreciation of photography as a powerful means to tell a story grew, until his main passion became conveying different stories to the best of his ability.

Mr Duncan said that his love of photography began at a very young age, when his father, ‘a wonderful man’, would take too long to take a picture.

‘My dad used to take forever to take photos,’ Mr Duncan told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I used to get frustrated and take it off him, and snap-snap, just take the picture.’

Since then, he said that his love and appreciation of photography as a powerful means to tell a story grew, until his main passion became conveying different stories to the best of his ability.

‘When I was 16 I began developing black and white photos, and processing them in the tray, I had an epiphany,’ he said.

‘The pictures emerged and that’s when I realised, wow, here lies magic.’ 

While Mr Duncan said it was impossible to choose his favourite image in Chasing the Light, ‘how do you choose your favourite child?’, he asked, he said that ‘Organ Pipes’, taken at Glenhelen Gorge (above) was one that stood out to him

His new photographic endeavour, a book called Chasing the Light, is not just about the story that he wants to tell, but about gently encouraging people to consider how digital media has changed the way ‘their story’ is told.

‘We are all so hooked up to digital media and social platforms, and all our images are online,’ he said.

‘That’s not a permanent story, and the sites that your photos are on hold your life story in their hands.’

Mr Duncan said he is passionate about reminding people of the importance of storing their photographs permanently and properly, so that they can tell their story well.

‘When my father died I only had seven days to be able to locate photos for the eulogy at his funeral, and luckily he had all of his photos in an album, but it made me think that most people won’t have that,’ he said.

‘If your photos are all over the place and in different formats, how will those who come after you locate and tell your story well?’ Mr Duncan asked.

The images within Chasing the Light express the veteran photographers love of telling stories in a series of stunning panoramic shots taken around Australia.

‘I want to show the beauty of creation and give people peace,’ said Mr Duncan. 

 Mr Duncan said that he would often spend hours just waiting for the right lighting or walking around to find the right shot, and so was delighted to capture a sunrise at King George Falls in the Kimberley (above)

‘It’s important to share the story behind a photo, because that gives it meaning,’ he said.

Over the years Mr Duncan has invested a lot of his time into educating young Indigenous Australians in remote communities, which he said gave him precious insight into the need for modern society to reconnect with the land.

‘The land holds the story of the passing of humanity, and if you slow down long enough, the land will reveal a story,’ he said.

‘My job is to go out there and try to connect with the land and listen to it tell a story, and then to capture that and bring it to people.’

‘If the images evoke something in the viewer I know I’ve succeeded.’

While Mr Duncan said it was impossible to choose his favourite image in Chasing the Light, ‘how do you choose your favourite child?’, he asked, he said that ‘Organ Pipes’, taken at Glenhelen Gorge was one that stood out to him.

The site was an Indigenous site sacred to women, which he was given permission to visit.

One of his other favourites was ‘Heaven Declares’, shot at Mullimburra Point in NSW, a spectacular shot of the night sky over the beach.

Mr Duncan said that he would often spend hours just waiting for the right lighting or walking around to find the right shot, and so was delighted to capture a sunrise at King George Falls in the Kimberley. 

'Bay of Fires', taken in Tasmania: ‘People need the story of hope, which is hard in a world that keeps being fed with fear. I try to bring that beauty to people because hope is the antidote,' said Mr Duncan

One of the remotest areas in Australia, Mr Duncan said he camped there overnight to ensure he got the right shot, and thought that many people would never have seen an image of the sight.

Spending so much time ‘out bush’, he said that he’s forced to look at nature, and is convinced that there is a much larger force at work in the world which created it.

‘If we open ourselves up we will see there’s something bigger than ourselves,’ Mr Duncan said.

‘People need the story of hope, which is hard in a world that keeps being fed with fear. I try to bring that beauty to people because hope is the antidote.’

Mr Duncan said that he loves Australia, and is convinced of its special place in the world.

‘We still haven’t stuffed up our environment, and people are starting to realise that we are all here together on this planet.’

‘We should never get so busy living that we forget to make a life. I want my photographs to inspire people to get outside into nature, and restore balance in their lives.’

Chasing the Light: Australia Wide is available now.
