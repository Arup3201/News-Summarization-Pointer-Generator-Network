There may have been no Premier League this weekend but there was still plenty of action from around the world. Here, Sportsmail's Ralph Ellis gives you 10 things we learned from this weekend's football...

1. Southampton’s £10m deadline day signing of striker Sadio Mané rather went under the radar, what with all the fuss around Radamel Falcao and Danny Welbeck. 

But the 22-year-old might just turn out to be a significant replacement for the goals lost when Rickie Lambert moved to Liverpool. 

Mané scored 45 in 87 games for Red Bull Salzburg – and showed he is in form with a strike that sealed Senegal’s shock 2-0 win over seven times African champions Egypt as the African Cup of Nations qualifiers began. Stoke’s Mame Biram Diouf got the first goal.

2. Paulo Bento looks like being the first managerial casualty of the European Championships after Portugal lost 1-0 at home to Albania.

With no Cristiano Ronaldo the Portuguese managed a paltry four shots on target – and none of those caused Albanian goalkeeper Etrit Berisha, who plays his club football in Italy for Lazio, the slightest bother.

Bento, in charge of a dismal World Cup campaign in which Portugal failed to get through their group behind the USA, got the full treatment from the crowd in the Aveiro stadium waving white hankies.

3. Germany might be world champions, but Brazil remain the star draw of the global game and proved it by setting an attendance record for “soccer” at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami.

Some 73,429 packed into the home of the Dolphins to see Neymar Junior’s goal secure a 1-0 win over Colombia in a friendly.

The growth of the game in the States, though, is underlined in it being only the fourth best attendance in America this year – the 109,318 who saw Manchester United play Real Madrid in Michigan is still the record.

4. Kasper Schmeichel can now be considered Denmark’s number one goalkeeper after getting picked by Morten Olsen for the start of the campaign.

The 27-year-old son of Manchester United legend Peter had played only one competitive game in his previous five caps, but after Leicester’s promotion to the Premier League he got the nod for the European Championship qualifier against Armenia.

He couldn’t mark the occasion with a clean sheet – beaten from distance by Borussia Dortmund midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan – but at least finished on the winning side as the Danes fought back with goals from Pierre Højbjerg and Thomas Kahlenberg.

5. If Roy Hodgson thinks he’s got problems with the press, then its nothing compared to the goings on in Ghana.

Former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan had to leave the training camp to post bail for his elder brother Baffour, who has been accused of leading an assault on a sports journalist.

The reporter was chased out of the Baba Yara Stadium after attempting to ask Asamoah in a press conference about rumours linking him to the disappearance of a musician.

6. Barry Fry’s ability to comb non-League football for players seems to have unearthed another gem for Peterborough in 22-year-old striker Kyle Vassell.

Rejected by both Norwich and Brentford as a kid, he trailed around nine different part-time clubs before Fry spotted him scoring six goals in a dozen games for Bishop’s Stortford, and signed him at London Road last January.

It’s taken Vassell some time to come to terms with full-time football – but his goal when he came on as sub in the 3-1 win over Port Vale took him to five in six League One games this term.

Problems: Roy Hodgson's media problems are nothing in comparison to those of Asamoah Gyan in Ghana

7. Chris Wilder worked miracles when he saved Northampton from almost certain relegation last season and continues to enhance his reputation this term.

The 46-year-old, who brought Oxford back from non-League football in his previous job, watched two goals by summer signing Marc Richards secure a win at Dagenham that put the Cobblers into the play-off places.

8. Steve Cotterill has been in charge of three basket-case clubs in a row at Notts County, Portsmouth and Nottingham Forest where in each case he brought some brief stability during chaotic financial times.

No wonder the 50-year-old is enjoying a more stable environment at Bristol City where he has started to turn the club round after saving them from fears last season of a second successive relegation.

Goals from Aden Flint and Greg Cunningham brought a 2-0 win over Scunthorpe that put the Ashton Gate club into the League One automatic promotion places.

9. Fallen giants Bristol Rovers are finding life tough in the Vanamara Conference – and their first taste of non-League day ended in shame at Braintree, not only because of the 2-0 defeat.

The club are facing an FA inquiry after one of their 565 travelling fans appeared to twice punch Braintree striker Simeon Akinda who had fallen into the back of the goal net.

10. Braintree wasn’t the only place where fan trouble spoiled the fantastic efforts to promote non-League football, which brought good crowds to little grounds throughout the country.

Darlington’s game at Droylsden in the Evo-Stik Northern League’s First Division North was held up for 20 minutes because fighting broke out among the visiting fans.

Darlington boss Martin Gray had to make a personal plea for peace before the trouble ended – but then saw his team, who were 1-0 up at the time, go on to lose 2-1.
