A teenage girl has described how she used her brown-belt karate skills to fight off a hooded man who attacked her in broad daylight and initially knocked her out cold. 

Terrified Shannon Stacey was walking along a path close to her home in Normanby, near Middlesbrough, at about 1pm on Friday when she noticed a large branch on the ground blocking her path.

As she bent down to move it, her attacker jumped out from bushes and punched her in the face so hard that she blacked out and fell to the ground.

Terrified: Shannon Stacey, 16, has spoken of her ordeal at the hands of a hooded attacker

The 16-year-old said: ‘I was walking from the bus stop with my earphones in when I felt something hit the side of my face.

‘It didn’t know what to think at first; everything went dark and I could hear a buzzing sound before I saw a man stood over me. It was then I realised he had punched me.’

The attacker, who was wearing a snood-type scarf covering his face and grey gloves, demanded Shannon hand over her phone, money and shopping bags, but the brave teenager refused.

She said: ‘My reaction was to say no. I was in complete shock.’

The attacker punched and kicked Shannon, who has just left Eston Park Academy, at least another three times before pinning her to the ground.

Shannon said: ‘He hit me again, and told me to hand over my bags so I threw one at him, and I was trying to block his punches. He had me pinned to the ground.’

Shannon, who has a brown belt in karate, managed to fight off the thug before running home just yards away.

‘I kicked and punched as much as I could and he eventually stopped,’ Shannon added.

‘I was screaming as loud as possible which I think must have scared him off.’

The attacker fled empty-handed on a red and white bike towards Normanby centre.

Mother Helen Stacey, who was in the kitchen at the time of the attack, said: ‘Shannon ran through the gate screaming and crying with blood pouring from her face. It’s any mother’s worst nightmare - I instantly thought the worst when she said a man had jumped on her.

‘I rang the police who were here in minutes. It was just horrendous. We were all in a state of panic and shock.’

Shannon was taken to Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital for X-rays on her face and wrist.

Helen, also mother to Adam, 12, and Joe, two, described Shannon as ‘brave and courageous’ for fighting off her attacker.

‘I’m just glad she has done karate,’ she added.

‘She has been very brave, and we just all hope whoever did this is caught before it happens to someone else.’

Shannon’s attacker is described as being in his twenties, tanned, of average build, with a local accent. He was wearing a grey tracksuit.

Cleveland Police said: 'We are investigating but haven't made any arrests yet.' 

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101.
