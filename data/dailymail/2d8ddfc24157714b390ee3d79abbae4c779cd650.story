They all look so jolly on television, forging friendships in the basement and occasionally nipping upstairs to lay the table or snuff out a candle.

But the truth of how most servants lived in Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century is a far cry from the soft-centred fiction portrayed in period dramas such as Downton Abbey, Upstairs Downstairs and Gosford Park.

Clipping your master's toenails, ironing his shoelaces, spending 17-hour days doing back-breaking work with no employment rights were just some of the realities facing servants in late Victorian and early Edwardian Britain, according to a new BBC series.

Then and now: A young 'tweeny' maid, left, in late nineteenth century Britain, and Downton Abbey's scullery maid Daisy, played by Sophie McShera.

Servants: the True Story Of Life Below 
Stairs explores the reality of life as a servant in Britain from the 
Victorian era through to the Second World War.

And it wasn't exactly like Carson, Anna, Bates and Daisy have it in Downton Abbey.

Upon entering service, new servants were often given 'acceptable', easy to remember and generic names - Henry, John and William were popular choices for men, while many female servants were frequently named Sarah or Emma.

Moreover, if female servants received unwanted advances from their masters, they had little power to stop them.

In her new, eye-opening three-part series, social 
historian Dr Pamela Cox - herself the great-granddaughter of servants - 
explains that life for these people was much less 'cosy' than is 
imagined in television period dramas.

A century ago, 1.5 million British people worked as servants

As a rule, most servants
tended to work not in big stately homes full of fellow workers and 
camaraderie but as the lone member of staff in a middle class town house -
and lives for these people was lonely, dark and damp, according to a 
new BBC documentary series.

Dr Cox reveals that her own ancestors never enjoyed their time as servants as much as those in ITV's Downton Abbey seem to.

Thanks to the emergence of the new 
middle classes, the majority of household staff worked as the only 
servant in a home.

And instead of partaking in a lively, jolly dinner after serving the family upstairs, these servants would live and eat alone in Britain's dark, damp, 
dirty basement kitchens.

Servants in grand houses fared little better.

Staff in stately homes were kept hidden from the 'polite' eyes of their masters with complex mazes of hidden passages throughout the home, helpful when trying to enforce complete segregation.

Moreover, strict servant hierarchy even separated staff from each other.

Dr Cox explains that in 1901 one in four people were domestic servants, mostly women, and that these people were seldom seen as 'working-class heroes'.

Servants tended to work seven days a week, often from as early as 5am until as late as 10pm, for very little money.

And, unlike the kind and empathetic Crawley family of Downton Abbey, employers were unlikely to take pity on staff who were overworked, exhausted or ill - even if they were just children.

Servants: The True Story Of Life Below The Stairs starts on Friday on BBC2 at 9pm.
