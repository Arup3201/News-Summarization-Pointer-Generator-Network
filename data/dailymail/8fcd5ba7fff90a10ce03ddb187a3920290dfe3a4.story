Police are hunting for two men dressed in cat suits who violently mugged a man.

Wearing costumes complete with ears and tails, the men pushed their victim into a concrete post and kicked him on the ground before rifling through his bag, stealing cash and a set of keys.

Security cameras caught the violent mugging of the victim as he walked to work at the Special Metals plant in Old School Lane, Hereford, Herefordshire, at 5.20am on Monday.

The dressed-up duo fled up the lane towards the Pegasus football ground.

Police are now studying CCTV footage for evidence.

Detective Sergeant Tim Powell said one suspect was dressed in a ‘camouflage’ looking costume with a ‘distinctive’ tail. The other wore a burgundy costume.

He said that both costumes came with cat ears.

According to the Hereford Times, witnesses have come forward saying they saw the men and reported it to police.

It is not the first time criminals have donned costumes to carry out felonies.

Last year a man tried to rob a convenience store wearing a life-size Gumby suit in San Diego. 

Gumby, a US TV claymation character, demanded money but the store clerk thought it was a joke and ignored him even though he claimed to have a gun.

The man turned himself in after the CCTV footage was aired on television.

Robbers in Chicago held up a bank wearing nuns' outfits and another in East 
Setauket, New York, wore a Santa costume.
