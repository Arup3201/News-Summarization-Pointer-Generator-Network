The five Israelis killed when a 
suicide bomber blew himself up at Burgas airport on Wednesday were laid 
to rest in a series of funerals today.

Bulgarian authorities are examining evidence from the deadly blast two days ago, trying to confirm the identity of the bomber.

They are also examining his fingerprints and the fake U.S. driving licence he had been carrying around.

The tourists had arrived in Bulgaria 
on a charter flight from Israel and were on the bus in the airport car 
park when the blast tore through the vehicle.

Body parts were strewn 
across the ground, mangled metal hung from the double-decker bus's 
ripped roof and black smoke billowed over the airport.

Video surveillance footage showed the casually dressed 
bomber circling around the 
group of buses an hour before the attack.

He had been carrying a bulky backpack, which contained 
the bomb he detonated in the luggage compartment of the bus, Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said.

Bulgarian prosecutors said today that 
the bomber had a short 
haircut, not the long hair seen in a security video, and tried to rent a
car in the days before the bombing but was turned down because his ID 
appeared suspicious.

He was believed to have been about 36 years old and had been in the 
country between four and seven days, Tsvetanov said.

Israeli and American officials have 
blamed the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the 
bombing

Israeli and American officials have 
blamed the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the 
bombing, and authorities in several other countries were trying to 
confirm the identity of the suicide bomber.

Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin 
Netanyahu said: 'The attack in Bulgaria was perpetrated by Hezbollah, 
Iran's leading terrorist proxy.'

No group has admitted responsibility 
for the attack so far, but Israel has said Iran is behind as series of 
attacks on its citizens in recent months.

Tsvetanov added
the investigation had ruled out that the bomber was a Bulgarian 
citizen, but did not say how authorities know that.

Israel has pledged to hit back at 
Iran, charging that the bombing was just the latest in a series of 
attacks against Israelis and Jews abroad. Iran has denied involvement.

Five vacationing Israelis were killed
in the blast in the popular Black Sea resort town of Burgas, along with
a Bulgarian bus driver and the bomber.

In the central Israeli city of Rishon 
Lezion, hundreds of mourners joined the family of Cochava Shriki, a 
42-year-old woman who had recently become pregnant after years of 
fertility treatments.

'You were my baby sister, and ever since
our mother died, I felt that I always had to protect you, to help you 
and to guide you,' her sister wailed in agony. 'Your death leaves a huge
void in our lives that cannot be filled.'

In nearby Petah Tikva, childhood friends Itzik Kolengi, 28, and Amir Menashe, 27, were buried.

Kolengi's wife, Gilat, was injured in the attack and remains hospitalised. The couple have a baby daughter.

'I promise you that the family and I 
will watch forever over your wife, Gilat, and your amazing daughter, 
Noya, who looks exactly like you, and we'll raise her just as you would 
have wanted,' Kolangi's brother David said. Menashe also left behind a son.

In northern Israel, Maor Harush, 26, was
laid to rest. His close friend Elior Price, 24, will be buried later 
Friday. A third friend remains in hospital in a serious condition.

The victims' coffins were received earlier today in a military ceremony at Israel's international airport. 
Seventeen Israelis remain in hospitals.

Media reports in Bulgaria earlier in 
the day claimed the man behind the horrific attack is 
Mehdi Ghezali, 33, an Algerian-Swedish Islamist.

He is believed to have spent two years
in Guantanamo Bay after he was arrested in Pakistan in 2001. But when 
he was released and sent back to Sweden the local government refused to 
press charges.

However, 
Mark Vadasz, director of communication at Säpo – the Swedish security 
service - told Swedish broadsheet Svenska Dagbladet that the allegations
were untrue.

‘We can say 
for sure that it is not this person. Reports of fingerprints is a 
statement the Bulgarian security service will have to take 
responsibility for. Other than that I cannot go into details.’

Bulgarian 
security services had received no indications of a pending attack.

The U.N. Security Council yesterday 
condemned the attack and said in a statement 'that any acts of terrorism
are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, 
wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.'

Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak 
said the Tehran-backed Lebanese Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah carried 
out the bombing.

'The immediate executors are Hezbollah people, who of 
course have constant Iranian sponsorship,' Barak told Israel Radio.

The blast occurred on the 18th 
anniversary of a bomb attack at the headquarters of Argentina's main 
Jewish organization that killed 85 people and the Argentine government 
blamed on Iran, which denied responsibility.

Mr Netanyahu said Iran, the Jewish state's arch-enemy, was behind the 
attack and that 'Israel will react powerfully against Iranian terror.'

Iran's embassy in Bulgaria denied that Tehran was behind the attack.

A spokesman said: 'The unfounded 
statements by different statesmen of the Zionist regime in connection 
with the accusations against Iran about its possible participation in 
the incident with the blown-up bus with Israeli tourists in Burgas is a 
familiar method of the Zionist regime, with a political aim, and is a 
sign of the weakness ... of the accusers.'

Medical officials said two badly 
injured Israeli tourists were taken to hospitals in Bulgaria's capital 
Sofia. One woman was in intensive care with head and chest injuries and a
man was in a critical state with burns covering 55 percent of his body.

About 30 lightly injured Israeli tourists were to be flown back to Israel later on Thursday.

Israeli officials had previously 
said that Bulgaria, a popular holiday destination for Israeli tourists, 
was vulnerable to attack by Islamist militants who could infiltrate via 
Turkey.

Israeli diplomats have been targeted in several countries in recent months by bombers who Israel said struck on behalf of Iran.

The mayor of Burgas on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, said the bus was carrying Israeli tourists, but the police could not immediately confirm the nationality of the dead

Although Tehran has denied 
involvement, some analysts believe it is trying to avenge the 
assassinations of several scientists from its nuclear programme that the
Iranians have blamed on Israel and its Western allies.

Israel and Western powers fear 
Iran is working towards a nuclear bomb but it says its uranium 
enrichment work is strictly for peaceful ends. Both Israel and the 
United States have not ruled out military action against Iranian nuclear
facilities.

'The attack is terrible and 
inexcusable,' said German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. 'It is a 
time to act responsibly. We have no information of our own. We urge 
caution in starting to assign blame.'
