Read Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel's full column - including why Steven Gerrard will not return to Liverpool on loan

Many times we agonise over the state and status of the English game. Are we better than La Liga? Are we better than Bayern Munich? Maybe not, but think on this.

In June 1995, Dennis Bergkamp signed for Arsenal after two difficult seasons with Inter Milan. His time there had deteriorated to such an extent that a newspaper giving a facetious award for the ‘Donkey of the Week’ renamed it ‘Bergkamp of the Week’. When Bergkamp left, Inter owner Massimo Moratti predicted he would not score 10 goals for Arsenal: the Italians could not believe they had got their money back.

That is how it was then. English clubs were way down Europe’s pecking order, the dumping ground for rejects or players looking for a last pay day. The same year as Bergkamp joined Arsenal, 32-year-old Ruud Gullit signed for Chelsea on a free transfer, having suffered massive injuries. Paul Ince, one of the finest midfield players in the country, meanwhile, was sold by Manchester United to Inter Milan at the age of 27.

Now, two decades on, look at us. Lukas Podolski cannot get in the team at Arsenal, so where does he go? Inter Milan. He arrived in Italy on Friday to complete a loan deal with a view to a £5million transfer.

Nemanja Vidic waited until approaching his 33rd birthday before swapping Manchester United for the San Siro, too. Now Adel Taarabt, who cannot get into Queens Park Rangers’ team, is holding out for his second loan move to AC Milan.

The decline of the Milan giants — AC are seventh, Inter 11th coming out of Italy’s winter break — has been dramatic, but this shift in power runs deeper. Ashley Cole had played his best years in the Premier League and could not even make England’s team at the World Cup, so decamped to Roma.

Italy’s relationship with English football has reversed. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich may be the might of Europe right now — but we forget how it once was for English clubs and how much has changed for us to even aspire to their level.
