Brazilian advertising regulators have warned a brewer over an advert for beer-flavoured ice cream, claiming it could tempt children to drink.

The advert for Skol ice cream shows a yellow tub that looks like a beer can, with the tagline: 'Shall we go to the bar to have an ice cream?'

The ice cream, launched in November, does not contain alcohol and is only sold in bars in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, meaning children should not be able to buy it.

The advert for Skol-flavoured ice cream appeared on the brand's website and Facebook page

It can only be sold to people over the age of 18 because it is linked to a beer brand.

The National Council for Self-Regulation fears that the campaign, which appeared on Skol's website and Facebook page, could make drinking seem attractive to children - especially as the social networking site does not restrict what under-18s can see.

The council does not have legal powers to force Ambev, Skol's owner, to take the advert down and said it was only a warning to be more careful in the future.

Ambev, Latin America's largest brewer, refused to comment on the council's warning, reported AFP.

Last year Ambev was warned by the council over a Skol advert for beer-flavoured Easter eggs.
