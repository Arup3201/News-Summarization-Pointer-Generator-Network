In a February news release, the police department said she 'was last seen at an address off of Kingston Highway around 4:30 a.m. Friday February 6, 2015.

'She has a lip ring and her feet were bleeding because she left walking on glass.'

WSB-TV pointed out that Cyndi Jones has also posted about what she says are her daughter's remains on Facebook Friday.

Jones wrote: 'My beautiful daughter was found today. I am heartbroken to say that she is no longer with us. I can not express to you the heartache and pain I feel.'

Police have not yet said if Ashley Jones' remains were discovered.

In a Saturday news release, Floyd County police said 'Around 1 p.m. on March 27 police investigators identified remains as being human that were found in the woods near Everwood Court.

'The road is located off of Canard Road, which is off Kingston Highway in north east Floyd County.

'Investigators believe there is a strong possibility that the remains are those of Ashley Jones, a 24-year-old woman who was reported missing by family in early February.

'The location of the discovery Friday is within walking distance of the area where Jones was last seen alive.'

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation's crime lab is going to look at the remains on Tuesday, police said.  

A deputy coroner told the Rome News-Tribune that the body spent approximately one month outdoors. A hiker came across the remains, according to the newspaper. 

A woman who lives in the area, Darci Jessie, told WSB-TV:  'They were searching our woods, behind our house, all through our neighborhoods, looking for this girl who had just vanished in the middle of the night.'
