Promise: Ed Miliband claims he will force big energy companies to pass on price cuts to customers

Labour leader Ed Miliband will pledge today to crackdown on profiteering energy companies as millions of families face soaring gas and electricity bills this winter.

The firms are reportedly preparing to boost profits from households from £45 to £65 - a jump of almost 50 per cent.

But they will be forced to pass on price cuts to customers by an incoming Labour government, Mr Miliband will tell a gathering of voters in Manchester.

He intends to axe the regulator Ofgem and introduce a new watchdog to order energy giants to reduce their prices.

He is quoted in the Daily Telegraph: 'The current system of regulation is not working. We'll rip it up to stop you getting ripped off.

'We will make sure that when the big companies pay less for the power they buy, you pay less for the energy you buy.'

Five million households will be affected by last month's announcement from SSE that prices will rise by 9 per cent for a typical duel fuel bill. This will mean an increase from £1,172 to £1,274.

British Gas  -one of the 'big six' energy companies - has told 10 million households that their bills could go up by as much as £100 next year.

Within the new few weeks other suppliers are expected to follow their lead as experts predict the average energy bills could hit a record £1,428 next year.

Mr Miliband will tell voters: 'You know what it’s like when the envelope hits the doormat with the gas bill or the electricity bill.

'The companies know you can’t choose not to pay it. They are making us pay more than we should.'

At this week's party conference, shadow energy 
secretary Caroline Flint will formally launch Labour plans to 
organise mass bargaining for energy bills.

In an hour-long question and answer session this afternoon, Mr Miliband will also appeal for voters to give him a chance to 'rebuild Britain'.

Poll winner: David Miliband is more popular than his brother, according to a Tory survey

He will seek to show he could govern the country more fairly by unveiling consumer-friendly policies.

Although Labour has been riding high in the opinion polls, the leader is under pressure to improve stubbornly poor personal ratings.

The Tories have highlighted the problem by releasing Populus research that found nearly two-thirds of Labour supporters would prefer Mr Miliband’s brother David in charge.

Some 73 per cent of those questioned agreed that Mr Miliband did not have what it takes to be prime minister in tough economic times, and 72 per cent that he was too weak for the job.

Mr Miliband will blame David Cameron and the coalition for destroying people’s trust in politicians, but admit that the challenges are 'severe'.

'Whoever wins the next election will be faced with a huge deficit,' Mr Miliband is expected to say.

'If it is a Labour government we will have to make difficult decisions. We will not be able to reverse all the cuts.

'We will take decisions about priorities like putting jobs ahead of pay rises. But don’t believe those who say that all politicians are the same. Because our decisions will be different.

'We would always put the interests of millions of working people ahead of tax cuts for millionaires,'Insisting Labour is 'on your side'.

He will also propose capping pension fund management fees, amid complaints that people saving for their retirement are being ripped off.

Accusing the coalition of failing to protect pensioners, Mr Miliband will say: 'Millions of working people are doing the right thing and putting money aside.

'The least they expect is for it to be there for them when they retire. But too often people are finding there is much less in the pot than they expected.

Policies: Labour's Liam Byrne will unveil a youth jobs initiative and Harriet Harman is looking at discrimination against women with the help of TV celebrities Arlene Phillips and Miriam O'Reilly who were dropped by the BBC

'What’s been happening is while you were saving, the company which was supposed to be helping you, the company you trusted, has actually been taking thousands of pounds out in hidden fees and charges.'

The SwitchTogether scheme has been hailed as proof that Labour can be a 'positive force for change' even out of government.

Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liam Byrne is announcing a Youth Employment Taskforce, a network designed to help more young people find work and monitor the impact of coalition policies.

The party is also creating a new 'policy hub' to widen involvement. Activists and the general public will be able to post responses to party policy documents.

Meanwhile, deputy leader Harriet Harman has brought in former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly and former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips to look at the issue of discrimination against older women.

The TV celebrities - both famously dropped by the BBC - will help draw up proposals for preventing ageism and sexism and consider whether legislation is necessary.
