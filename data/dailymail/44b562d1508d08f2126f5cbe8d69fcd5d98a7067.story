A registered New York sex offender kidnapped his estranged girlfriend at gunpoint in Ohio along with her one-year-old she was pushing in a stroller.

Thomas Lorde, Latasha Jackson, and her infant daughter Chaniya Wynn were found shot to death hours later in an apparent murder-suicide.

Cleveland police said the couple had dated for about two months and that Jackson, 19, was trying to end the relationship.

Grisly scene: The three were found in this detached two-car garage 12 hours after police began their search

Jackson and Chaniya Wynn were walking with Jackson's 14-year-old brother around noon Saturday when they encountered 35-year-old Lorde, according to police.

The teen told police that Lorde pulled out a gun and ordered him to walk away, saying he was going to kill Jackson and take the child.

Their bodies were found early Sunday in a closed garage of an unoccupied building behind the now-closed Rendezvous Club, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported.

It appeared that Lorde shot himself in the head after shooting the two females. Police recovered a 9mm bullet from Lorde's car, according to the Plain Dealer.

Last seen: Latasha and her daughter were last seen at 72nd St and Union Avenue in Cleveland yesterday afternoon

Last known address: Lorde was said to be living at this house on E. 65th St in Cleveland

Hours after the bodies were discovered, someone spray painted the words: ‘Rest in Peace Latasha & Chaniya. We love u. 2012' on the garage.

Mourners also laid flower bouquets along the door.

Community activist Khalid Samad told the Plain Dealer that a candlelight vigil will be held Tuesday night for the young mother and daughter.

Chaniya’s 28-year-old father told police that Lorde had threatened to kidnap Jackson and kill her daughter, but refused to speak with reporters.

The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the causes of death.

Lorde was described as a violent sexual predator with outstanding felony warrants in New York in an Amber Alert for Jackson and her daughter. 

He was from the Bronx and was convicted in 1996 for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl at knife-point, the Plain Dealer said.

A phone number for his last known address, in Cleveland, could not be found.

Telephone messages seeking comment from family members of Jackson and Wynn were not immediately returned.
