Britain's oldest comic The Dandy is facing closure after 75 years.

At its most popular between the 1950s and the 1980s, the adventures of cow pie-eating Desperate Dan and Korky the Cat sold two million copies a week.

But competition from computer games and the internet has seen sales plummet to fewer than 8,000 in the second half of 2011.

Publishers DC Thomson are considering the comic’s future – and even the possibility of moving Desperate Dan to the pages of The Dandy’s long-time rival and sister title, The Beano.

A spokesman for the Dundee-based publisher confirmed it was considering closing the magazine but said the most popular characters would continue to exist online.

He said: ‘There are many challenges within the industry at present, but we’re excited that the digital revolution has also given us an opportunity to innovate and develop.

‘We’re confident that future generations will continue to enjoy our much-loved products and characters.’

Despite outlasting other once-popular comics, including The Beezer and The Topper, a series of recent relaunches have failed to regenerate The Dandy’s sales.

In 2007, it was rebranded as Dandy Xtreme, a fortnightly version of the comic, and in 2010 its creators introduced celebrity-themed strips starring well-known figures such as Simon Cowell and Jeremy Clarkson.

But sales continued to fall, dropping by 50 per cent between 2010 and 2011.

Britain’s most popular comic The Beano has also struggled in recent years.  According to the most recent figures its circulation was only 38,000 at end of 2011.

Anita O’Brien, curator of the Cartoon Museum in London, said comics have struggled to keep up in the digital age.

She said: ‘Kids have other things to spend their time and money on these days like playing computer games and things like that.

‘We do workshops and lots of kids want to create their own stories and do enjoy reading them, but there are definitely challenges.’
