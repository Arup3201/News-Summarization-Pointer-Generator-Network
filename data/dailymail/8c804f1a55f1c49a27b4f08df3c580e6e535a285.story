The daughter of Eric Garner, whose chokehold death at the hands of a cop sparked mass protests against the NYPD, offered her support today for the family of two murdered officers.

Emerald Snipes, 22, laid a wreath at the site where a cop-hunting gunman killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Weinjen Liu, and said she knows how it feels to spend the holidays without a father.

'I just had to come out and let their family know that we stand with them, and I’m going to send my prayers and condolences to all the families who are suffering through this tragedy,' Snipes told ABC.

Snipes told the New York Post she visited the Ramos family and described being moved by a Facebook post from 13-year-old Jaden Ramos, expressing his grief over the death of his father.

'It hit my heart,' Snipes told the New York Daily News while she laid the wreath. 'I know how it feels in this season to not have your father around.' 

'Today I had to say bye to my father,' Jaden wrote in his Facebook post. 'He was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer.'

Snipes was joined by Dominique Sharpton, daughter of Rev Al Sharpton, who has been vocal about calling for protests in the wake of Garner's death by chokehold by a plainclothes NYPD officer. 

'I was never anti-police,' she added. 'Like I said before, I have family that’s in the NYPD that I’ve grown up around, family reunions and everything so my family you know, we’re not anti-police.' 

Tensions have escalated after the shooting by 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who wrote 'They take 1 of ours...let’s take 2 of theirs' and referenced the deaths of Garner and Mike Brown on an Instagram post he made while traveling to New York from Baltimore.

Some of the bitterest rhetoric has come from the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and its president Pat Lynch, who told reporters there was 'blood on many hands' on Saturday.

Lynch placed blame on the mayor, Bill de Blasio, and protesters for the killing, his words echoing a memo circulated among officers, reported by the New York Times to be from the PBA, and stating the NYPD would now be a 'wartime police department.'

Ramos’s funeral is now scheduled for Saturday and the family will have a viewing Friday in Glendale, Queens. Family members of Liu are arriving from China, and his services have not been announced.
