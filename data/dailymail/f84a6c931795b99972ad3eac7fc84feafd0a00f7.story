As the saying goes, 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away,' - now research suggests that eating large amounts of fruit and vegetables every day can keep the therapist away, too.

A study by The University of Queensland has found that eight or more portions every 24 hours drastically improves mental wellbeing.

Dr Redzo Mujcic,  a researcher from the University of Queensland, collected data from 12,000 Australian adults to examine how their consumption of fruit and vegetables correlates with their mental health.

The study found the current Australian guidelines fruits and vegetables do not account for psychological effects

'The current guidelines for five vegetables and two fruits per day are based on physical health. We wanted to look at the effect fruit and vegetables have on life satisfaction, distress and overall vitality,' he said. 

'The existing guidelines need to be reviewed. Our research found that eating five fruits and vegetables a day is ideal, and less than ten per cent of Australians are eating this amount.'

Dr Mujcic said that although it may sound expensive, the study accounted for socio-economic factors, as it was correlated from household studies.

He claimed international studies support his case.

'There was one study from the UK and one from New Zealand which found that people are at their happiest with eight portions of fruit and vegetables,' he said.

Other results from the study found that fruit has a larger impact on mental health than vegetables, and women experience more of a mental health benefit than men.

Dr Mujcic says he would like to follow up with a more conclusive case study, but he requires a government grant to do so.
