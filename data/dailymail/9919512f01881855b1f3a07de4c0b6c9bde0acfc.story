A teenager bitten by a false widow as she watched a horror film feared she would lose her hand after the poison spread through her veins.

Stephanie Georgiou was rushed to hospital and needed three operations after she was nipped by the spider on a date at the Enfield cinema earlier this month.

She has since had two operations to 
remove tissue from her hand that have left her with a two by three 
centimetre wound that will require grafting with skin from her arm, 
leaving her permanently scarred.

Stephanie Georgiou was bitten by a spider whilst watching the film Paranormal Activity

The bite had become swollen and full of pus and it was so painful it made her cry

The 18-year-old has been scarred for life
 and left so traumatised by the experience that she has vowed to never 
go back to the cinema again.

With her right arm in a sling, speaking today the final year childcare student said: 'When I found out they had to operate I was scared I would lose my hand.

'They have had to take two massive chunks out to make sure all the infection has been cut out.

'I can't face going back to another movie, it's been the worst thing ever.'

Miss Georgiou visited the Enfield Cineworld on January 2 - the day after her 18th birthday - for an evening showing of Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones.

Describing the moment she was bitten, she said: 'It happened right at the start of the film when the adverts were playing.

She was rushed to the Chase Farm hospital with a raised heartbeat and fever which doctors suspected was down to a false widow bite

'I felt this thing like an electric shock, and I scratched my right hand but didn't think about it and carried on watching the film.

'I started feeling really hot, but I thought it was just the temperature in the cinema, and my hand was itching.

'Then when we left I didn't feel right, I was really dizzy and I snapped at my date.'

It wasn't until a three days later that Miss Georgiou realised something was seriously wrong with her hand. The bite had become swollen and full of pus and it was so painful it made her cry.

Her GP immediately recognised she had been bitten by an insect, but did not suspect it was from the potentially deadly false widow.

She was given some antibiotics but her hand turned bright red as the poison spread.

The teen returned home but her condition deteriorated and she was rushed to the Chase Farm hospital the next day with a raised heartbeat and fever which doctors suspected was down to a false widow bite.

She has had an operation after the wound left her permanently scarred.

Today Cineworld issued an apology to Miss
 Georgiu, saying they were 'deeply sorry' about the alleged false widow 
bite and were taking 'expert advice to ensure our cinemas are free from 
any kind of insect/ pest control.'

However, the cinema bite is probably an isolated case, according to London Zoo keeper and invertebrate expert Craig Walker.

He said: 'The spiders are found mostly down in the south east of England, living in indoor places and they hang their webs under things where its warm and where you don't vacuum.

'They often come into the country on produce and it's likely that in this case a spider came to the cinema in someone's shopping, or on a coat or some clothing that had been kept in a cupboard.

'But it would be very unusual for them to live in a cinema. I would imagine there is a lot of cleaning and vacuuming of the velour seats, the constant up and down motion would disturb their webs and they need to feed on other live animals - but a human is a bit big for them.'

Miss Georgiou suffered a bad reaction to her bite, although the danger posed by the tiny spiders shouldn't be exaggerated.

Mr Walker continued: 'They are generally not harmful, but like most spiders they are venomous and if you do happen to be sensitive to the venom then they do pose a risk.

'We don't worry like this about bees, but there are many deaths every year from bee stings. I am yet to hear of anyone dying from a false widow.

'But remember if you are bitten by something and have an unusual reaction you should go to the hospital to have it checked out.'
