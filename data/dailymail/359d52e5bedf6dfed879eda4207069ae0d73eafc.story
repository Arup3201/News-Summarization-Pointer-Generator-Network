Tributes have poured in for the Bahamas' most famous minister after he was killed along with eight others when his private jet crashed. 

Dr Myles Munroe died in the accident, believed to have been caused by turbulent weather.

He was traveling in the Lear 36 Executive Jet with his wife Ruth and several members of their Evangelical congregation to Grand Bahama to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum that he organized.

But as the pilot attempted to land in Freeport, the craft careered into a shipping container crane, killing everyone on board. 

Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell said that a commercial Bahamasair flight making the same route, from Nassau to Freeport, at the same time had turned back because it was unable to land.

Civil aviation authorities launched an investigation on Monday.

The death of Munroe, one of the most prominent pastors in predominantly Christian Bahamas, stunned the country.

'It is utterly impossible to measure the magnitude of Dr. Munroe's loss to the Bahamas and to the world,' Prime Minister Perry Christie said. 'He was indisputably one of the most globally recognizable religious figures our nation has ever produced.'

Born in 1954 in the islands' capital of Nassau, Munroe founded Bahamas Faith Ministries International in the early 1980s after studying at Oral Roberts University, a Christian liberal arts school in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

In shock Tearful mourners gathered at Bahamas Faith Ministries last night soon after they learned that Dr Myles Munroe died in a plane crash on Grand Bahama with eight others yesterday

The charismatic pastor quickly became an influential religious leader among many evangelical Christians, giving sermons around the world and occasionally appearing on televangelist Benny Hinn's popular programs. 

He was also a motivational speaker and the author of numerous books, including the 2008 best-seller 'God's Big Idea: Reclaiming God's Original Purpose for Your Life.'

As news of the plane crash spread, members of his church were shown weeping on a Bahamas TV station or raising their hands in prayer. Fellow Christian pastors expressed shock.

'At times like these, I don't try to figure things out, I just know that all things ultimately figure into a larger and higher purpose that we may never fully understand in this present limited reality,' Bishop Carlton Pearson, a high-profile U.S. minister who was a friend of Munroe's for 40 years, wrote on his Facebook page.

Well-known: Dr. Myles Munroe, a prominent pastor, and his wife, Ruth, were among those killed in the crash. Munroe was the founder of Bahamas Faith Ministries International Fellowship which has extended from the shores of the Bahamas to Africa and Asia

Personality: Dr Munroe is a well-known author and motivational speaker who visited various African countries.

Tough conditions: Heavy rain was buffeting the region when the Lear 36 Executive Jet struck a shipping container crane in Freeport on landing

Munroe, 60, and his entourage were traveling to Grand Bahama to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum that he organized. 

He planned to have dinner in Freeport about 90 minutes after his plane's scheduling landing with former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young, a speaker at the event, Mitchell said.

Munroe's wife, Ruth, was also on the plane, along with the pastor considered second-in-command at Bahamas Faith Ministries, Richard Pinder, as well as the group's youth minister and his wife and child.

Munroe, who grew up poor in the Bahamas, was considered an inspiration for many people in the island chain and abroad, the foreign minister said.

 'He has really put his name on the world stage and helped the Bahamas achieve recognition for talent,' the foreign minister said.

'He was a leader in our country,' said Christopher Duncan. 'He spoke at a number of national events. I've read some of his books. Just the way he viewed life and the way he understood God's purpose for our lives made you look at life a different way.'

'Dr. Munroe was a spiritual fiber of our country,' added Monique Dorsett, who lives in the Bahamas but is vacationing in Miami. 'He epitomized Christianity and the way he lived. He was international .'
