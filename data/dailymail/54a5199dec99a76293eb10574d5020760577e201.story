A newly married BASE jumper fell to her death on Saturday in Zion National Park after her parachute failed to open while her husband looked on.

Amber Marie Bellows, 28, who was described as an experienced jumper, lept off Mount Kinesava in the Utah national park at around 4pm and fell 2,000 feet to her death when her chute failed.

Her husband of two weeks, Clatyon Butler, 29, jumped after her but could not help her. He had to walk out for four hours before he could raise the alarm about the accident.

He told authorities when he sought their help at around 6.30pm that he could not reach her in time.

Tragedy: Newly-wed Amber Marie Bellows when she fell to her death in Zion National Park, Utah, (not pictured) after her parachute failed to open following a BASE jump on Saturday

The married couple had journeyed to the popular park from Salt Lake City and hiked up Mount Kinesava on Saturday morning to BASE jump - which is strictly prohibited in the park.

Amber went first but her chute failed and when Clayton reached officials he informed them his wife was dead.

That meant the park service waited until Sunday morning to retrieve her body by helicopter rather than risk a rescue in the dark on Saturday evening.

Her body was hoisted up by two rangers at around 10am from where she was placed in a waiting ambulance when the helicopter landed.

She was closely linked to Skydive Utah in Erda as well as Skydive Ogden.

Representatives from both facilities said they were too upset to talk to the Deseret News on Sunday.

BASE jumping involves leaping from a fixed object and using a parachute.

Its name is an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span and Earth â€” the types of fixed objects from which a person can jump.

Mount Kinesava is a plateau, approximately 3,000 feet from top to bottom, with a 1,000 foot sheer cliff on its east-facing side.

The hike to the top of Kinesava takes approximately half a day and the peak is currently covered in up to 10 inches of snow.
