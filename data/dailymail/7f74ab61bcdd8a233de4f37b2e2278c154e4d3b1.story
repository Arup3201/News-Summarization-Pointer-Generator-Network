Zanib Khan pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court, was jailed for 12 months yesterday after exchanging sexy letters and phone calls with seven inmates at Brixton prison

One prison officer every week is being caught having an ‘inappropriate relationship’ with an inmate, official figures show.

More than 120 prison staff faced disciplinary action for getting too close to a prisoner over a 33-month period.

But less than a third were dismissed, and most were simply moved to another job with only a handful prosecuted.

Earlier this week a woman prison officer was jailed for swapping erotic letters and phone calls with four serving convicts.

Zanib Khan, 27, was given a 12-month term after a court heard she made ten hours of amorous calls to drug dealers and robbers.

Among other staff exposed in recent years are several who had sex with prisoners, sent racy texts or letters, or had contact with criminals outside work, on the phone or online.

At one prison, HMP Onley, five female prison officers resigned in six years.

Tory MP Philip Davies, who uncovered the figures, said: ‘Not all inappropriate relationships are sexual, but this is still a big issue.

'Many prisoners are very manipulative people and do actively set out to manipulate prison officers.

‘Some want physical relationships or often it’s to get special favour while they are in prison.

‘There are very serious implications for security in prisons.’

In one of the worst cases, six women officers were forced to resign or were sacked from Aylesbury Young Offenders’ Institution in Buckinghamshire after forming relationships with prisoners over three years.

One, Kelly-Anne McDade, was jailed for 30 months in November 2010 after she had a baby with an inmate.

Prison volunteer Alice Belton, 23, had ‘phone sex’ with inmates at Parkhurst jail on the Isle of Wight and was arrested after smuggling in a mobile phone.

She was given a suspended sentence after a probe uncovered explicit photos of her on inmates’ mobiles.

Ministry of Justice figures show that between January 2008 and October 2010, some 126 prison workers were investigated and found to have had inappropriate relationships with inmates at jails in England and Wales.

Five were convicted, 85 moved to other jails and 36 dismissed.

The Prison Service says it has strict guidelines about what constitutes an inappropriate relationship between staff and criminals, and anybody breaking the rules will face the toughest sanctions.

The HM Prison Service conduct and discipline guidelines state: ‘Staff must exercise particular care to ensure that their dealings with prisoners, former prisoners and their friends and relations are not open to abuse, misrepresentation or exploitation on either side.’

Steve Wagstaffe, director of Public Sector Prisons, said: ‘We remain committed to identifying and eradicating all forms of staff wrongdoing.

'Where staff develop an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner they put themselves and their colleagues at risk, potentially undermining the safety of the prison.’
