In the Texas lawsuit where a football star is out to get an engagement ring returned, the ex-fiance is now telling her story and has returned fire with a counter-suit.

With the help of a powerful Houston attorney, Erin Marzouki is seeking to correct what she calls her ex-fiance Mario Williams' 'silly' accusations and doesn't intend to give back the ring because it was given to her as an unconditional gift.

Former Houston Texans star Williams, who now plays for the Buffalo Bills, is worth over $30M with a $100M contract, but that isn't stopping him from suing Marzouki to get back the $785,000 engagement ring he gave her in February 2012.

Happier times: Buffalo Bills' Mario Williams poses for a photo with his fiancee Erin Marzouki. They've since split and are suing and counter suing over the engagement ring

The suit seeks recovery of a stunning
10.04 carat diamond ring from Marzouki after, Williams claims, she 
decided to end their engagement with Williams in January.

According
to court documents, Marzouki only had dollar signs in her eyes and not 
butterflies in her stomach when she first said yes to the proposal.

Blinged out: Williams wants the 10-carat $785,000 diamond engagement ring he bought returned, Marzouki's counter claim says it was a gift and he wasn't committed anyway

'(Marzouki) never intended to marry 
(Williams) and used the relationship as a means to get to (Williams’) 
money and acquire gifts,' says the lawsuit, filed by Houston attorneys 
Monica Schulz Orlando and Michael Gary Orlando.

But papers filed by Marzouki in a counter suit tell a totally different story.

She
says Williams was the one who broke off the engagement because part of 
him 'wanted to be married and start a family, while another part wanted 
to continue to live the life of a wealthy bachelor who could do whatever
he wanted, with whomever he wanted, whenever he wanted.'

According to the counter-claim, Williams broke off the engagement several times but never asked for the return of the ring. She even claims she returned the ring on her own volition the first time he ended the engagement.

Marzouki claims she had enough and refused to reconcile despite his pleadings after the most recent split.

Williams' lawyers have asked the court to obtain the ring from Ms. Marzouki until the legal action is resolved.

Marzouki's claim asserts that Williams' suit only seeks 'harass and scare.'

Williams
gave the engagement ring to Marzouki on February 19th 2012 along with 
an American Express card to which she charged $108,000 during 2012 and 
'additional luxurious items' valued at about $230,000.

Breakup: Mario Williams, 28, is suing Erin Marzouki, 31, in a civil lawsuit for the return of her $785,000 engagement ring

Bling: The ring is a GIA certified radiant cut diamond weighing 10.04 carats, E color grade and VS2 clarity grade worth $785,000

But it was all over within a year with when Marzouki 'unilaterally terminated' the engagement on January 21st 2013.

The court documents says Williams ex-fiance 'never intended to marry and used the relationship as a means to get money and acquire gifts.'

The lawsuit exudes Williams' bitterness over the failed relationship and states that Williams has refused requests to return the diamond engagement ring..

Rich: Wiilliams signed six-year deal with the Buffalo Bills in 2012, worth up to $100 million, with $50 million guaranteed

Counter punch: Marzouki maintains Williams broke up with her repeatedly. Williams' suit claims Marzouki was only seeking his money.

In one year he claims he spent $1,123,000 on a fiancée who broke up with him just months after they’d become engaged.

Williams’ lawyers are now looking to take out a restraining order that would prevent Marzouki from selling or damaging the ring or keeping any proceeds by selling it.

Williams was the first selection in the 2006 NFL draft by the Texans and played in Houston through the 2011 season.

Although by regular standards the ring is a fortune, it is pocket change to Williams who last year signed one of the most lucrative contracts for a defensive player in NFL history: a six-year, $100 million with the Buffalo Bills with $50 million in cash guaranteed.
