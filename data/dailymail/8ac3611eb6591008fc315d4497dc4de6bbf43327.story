Hull defender Michael Dawson will lead his side into Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Chelsea insisting confidence levels have not been hit by a fortnight of frustration which has plunged them deeper into the relegation dogfight.

Missed opportunities against Sunderland and Leicester have left the Tigers hovering three points above the drop zone while their hopes have also been hit by the news that striker Nikica Jelavic faces six weeks on the sidelines after knee surgery.

On the face of it a clash with Jose Mourinho's champions elect is the last thing the struggling hosts might wish for but former Tottenham star Dawson is adamant his team can once again rise to the occasion this weekend.

Michael Dawson (centre) says his side are not low in confidence and have a great fighting spirit 

Dawson said: 'We have got a spirit and a fight about us and we have certainly shown that in recent weeks. It's all about fine margins and at the end of the day we picked up points that might be valuable at the end of the season.

'It is a massive challenge playing against all the top teams but we have been away to Anfield and Manchester City and Arsenal and picked points up and we could quite easily have picked up all three against City.'

The Tigers' survival hopes took another hit last week when fellow strugglers Burnley upset Manuel Pellegrini's men at Turf Moor but Dawson says that upset can provide inspiration for his own side on Sunday.

'You do look at other results, there's no hiding that, and seeing that kind of result definitely gives us that belief,' added Dawson. 'On paper it wasn't one you would look at but credit to Burnley who showed what the Premier League is about.'

Jelavic's untimely absence will mean another chance for either record signing Abel Hernandez or Sone Aluko in attack, but the game is likely to come too early for long-term injured trio Mohamed Diame, Robbie Brady and Liam Rosenior.

However despite Jelavic's grim immediate prognosis, boss Steve Bruce is determined not to completely write the Croatian striker off and believes he could yet return to play a part in the potentially crucial end-of-season run-in.

Bruce said: 'Being realistic we think it's going to be at least six weeks. It could force him out for the rest of the season, but knowing Jela the way I do I am sure he is going to give it a good shot.' 

Nikica Jelavic faces up to six weeks out and is all but ruled out of their Premier League survival bid
