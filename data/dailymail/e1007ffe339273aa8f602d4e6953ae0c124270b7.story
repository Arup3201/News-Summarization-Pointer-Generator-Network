Barcelona forward Neymar has urged the Spanish football authorities to punish Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo following his violent outbursts against Cordoba.

Ronaldo apologised after being sent off for kicking Cordoba defender Edimar Fraga and slapping Jose Crespo during their La Liga win on Saturday, but could escape with just a two-match ban.

Neymar understands forwards can be provoked into retaliating, but insists the former Manchester United player should be punished for his aggressive behaviour during the 2-1 win.

'Those of us playing as forwards are exposed to provocations and intimidation and sometimes you lose your nerve,' Neymar said. 

'It's clear we cannot do that under any circumstances. He must be punished because of the aggression. It is difficult because sometimes there is provocation.

'It happened to Zinedine Zidane, it happened to me. Nobody has the coolness to remain calm 100 per cent of the time. We must think with our heads. I think he should be punished.

'It is the referee's responsibility to protect players on the pitch, particularly when they are targeted by hard challenges. Hard tackles must be punished.' 

But Ronaldo could miss just two matches after his red card was not regarded as violent conduct.

Ronaldo will discover his punishment by Wednesday once the Spanish football's disciplinary committee meet. 

Referee Alejandro Hernandez Hernandez's report does not contain any details of Ronaldo striking Crespo in the face, though the Spanish football's disciplinary committee could ask the official to explain his brief summary.

A three-match ban would see the three-time Ballon d'Or winner miss games against Real Sociedad, rivals Atletico Madrid and Sevilla.

Neymar himself is no stranger to violence on the pitch following the Brazilian's involvement in a mass brawl during former club Santos's win over Uruguay's Penarol in the Copa Libertadores in 2011. The forward appeared to kick and stamp on opponents after Santos won 2-1.

He is set to face Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night in the Copa del Rey quarter-final.
