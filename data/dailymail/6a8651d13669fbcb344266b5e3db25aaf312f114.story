Linsey Lindberg is one woman who never needs a man to help her open a jar or carry her bags - because she is stronger than most men.

In fact Linsey, 33, is so strong she can tear a telephone book with her bare hands, bend a frying pan in half and crush apples with her biceps.

Despite her butter-wouldn't-melt look, the pretty brunette bends metal bars into hearts, uses her fist to hammer nails into wood and can even blow a hot water bottle up like a balloon - until it bursts.

Core strength: Strong woman Linsey Lindberg crushes a pair of apples with her biceps

Linsey, known by her stage name Mama Lou travels the world showcasing her unique talent in a series of bizarre feats of strength.

The former religious studies graduate, from Austin, Texas was working at a prestigious accounting firm in New York before she quit to follow her dream to join the circus.

She spent time performing as an aerialist at a circus in Montreal before deciding to use her strength to create a unique act of her own.

Linsey spent months attempting to rip telephone directories in half and bending bars in a bid to carve out her niche in the industry.

Number's up: Linsey makes light work of destroying a telephone directory

Shredded: Linsey, who is known by her stage name Mama Lou, triumphantly throws up the pieces of paper into the air

Impressive: Linsey shows off her most difficult trick - blowing up a hot water bottle until it explodes

She said: 'I was working at AXA Financial with grand offices in the Rockefeller Centre making more money than both my parents and I decided to quit my job and run away with the circus.

'Everyone thought I was crazy, I had this great job and yet I was quitting to work as a circus performer. But I just thought if I don't do it now, I never will.

'After a while I fell out of love with the circus and wanted to become a street performer but I knew I needed an act, something brand new.

'I'd always been quite strong and so decided to base my act on my strength. One day I looked at a telephone book and thought 'I wonder if I can rip it in half?' The idea for my act came from there.

'It wasn't easy , there was a lot of trial and error. I would get my room mate in Montreal to help me out with my acts.

Tough nut: The strongwoman hammers a nail into a piece of wood with her bare hands

'I'd beg him to help me with these 
really weird stunts. I'd built this bed of nails at home and I'd be like
'please come stand on me'.

Her most jaw-dropping feat of 
strength is the ability to blow a hot water bottle up with her mouth 
until it bursts - a stunt so dangerous it could cause her lungs to 
explode.

Linsey then showcased her self-taught feats of strength to the public as a street performer in Montreal.

The
public loved her act and word of her strength quickly spread. Her 
unique talent has now earnt her hoards of fans across the world, as she 
travels the globe performing at events across the US, Europe and as far a
field as Australia and New Zealand.

She
said: 'When I finally managed to rip the phone book in half I screamed,
ran around my living room picked up some duck tape and stuck the book 
to my wall, I was so proud of myself.

For my next trick: Linsey prepares to bend a metal bar. She gave up a well-paid job with an investment and insurance company to become a circus strongwoman

Crunchtime: Strongwoman Linsey goes to work on a metal bar which she swiftly bends into a heart shape

'The next thing I learnt was bending metal bars and I moved onto crushing apples with my biceps pretty quickly after that.

It was really funny looking back but
that first year I was terrible, I'd fail miserably nearly everyday but I
refused to give up.'

'No-one
is magically brilliant at anything straight away, I believed it was 
worthwhile enough to go ahead with that I stuck with it.

'There were times in the beginning when I thought about giving up but I wouldn't let myself.

'I think it comes down to the fact I didn't want to go home with my tail between my legs, failure wasn't an option.'

Pan handler: With Linsey around, no household object is safe

Crush on you: Linsey, 33, is so strong she can bend a frying pan in half as if it were made of cardboard

It
took six months of practicing before Linsey finally managed to tear the
telephone directory in two, it was this achievement which spurred her 
on to continue.

The 5'2 performer quickly taught herself to bend bars, punch nails into flaming blocks of wood and crush apples with her biceps.

'Blowing up and popping a hot water bottle is definitely the hardest and most dangerous part of my act.

'It took about a year to perfect, I can now do it under a minute.

'There's so much air pressure that when it explodes the bits of rubber often hits me in the face, which hurts.

'The
real danger is the air pressure, if a little bit of air comes out of 
the water bottle and back into your lungs it can cause your lungs to 
explode.'

Stitch up: Linsey relaxes with a spot of knitting. She spent months attempting to rip telephone directories in half and bending bars in a bid to carve out her niche

'I
tested my act with the public as a street performer in Montreal. The 
reaction from the audience was so strong it spurred me onto continue.

'Now
I've created this truly unique show and I have fans all over the world.
Little girls come to my show in outfits like mine. One little girl told
me she has a poster of me next to Justin Bieber in her bedroom, which 
is really cool.

'So
much of being a strong woman is about inspiring people to try it for 
themselves. People don't fully appreciate my show until they go home and
try to rip a telephone book in half and realise they can't.

'I've had ex military and special forces men offer to pay me $100 to teach them how to rip the telephone book but I can't, you can be strong and I can teach people the technique but its as much practice as it is skill.

Big hitter: Linsey Lindberg playing baseball when she was youngster. She has always been strong and decided to base her circus act on her tremendous physical strength

'I'm always looking for new ideas for
my act and at the moment I'm combining my aerialism with my strength so
I'll hang from a bar by my feet and tear the telephone book.'

When
she's not showcasing her strength, Linsey said she is very girly at 
heart and loves to knit and bake cookies in her spare time.

She
said being a strong woman does have a downside as men are often 
intimidated by her strength and rarely offer to carry her bags.

She added: 'I am a strong woman but at home I'm like most other women, I'm very girly I love to cook, knit, do crochet and sew.

'I enjoy sitting by the pool and sunbathing, I'm very girly at heart.

'Being strong means I get asked to open a lot of jars and very rarely does a guy carry my bags, they offer and then they look at me and say "you're stong enough, do it yourself."'
