Happy father: The Duke of Cambridge during his first interview since the birth of Prince George, for a documentary to be screened next month

Prince William has revealed how the birth of his ‘little rascal’ son has changed his life.

In a candid interview, his first since becoming a father, he admitted the days following George’s arrival had been ‘emotional’, and affected him more than he thought possible.

But the prince could not resist joking about the sleepless nights and endless  dirty nappies of fatherhood – and how his newborn son reminded him of his younger brother, Prince Harry.

Asked about what legacy he would like to leave George, he quipped: ‘At the moment, the only legacy I want to pass on to him is to sleep more and maybe not have to change his nappy so many times.’

William gave the interview, his first since George’s birth on July 22, to CNN’s royal correspondent Max Foster as part of a  documentary about his determination to preserve wildlife in Africa.

Prince William’s Passion: New Hope, New Father airs on the American channel on  September 15, but excerpts of the interview have been released today.

He was interviewed in the gardens of  Kensington Palace on August 2, when his son was 11 days old.

On being a new father, William said: ‘I think the last few weeks for me have been just a very different emotional experience. Something I never thought I would feel myself.

'And I find, again it’s only been a short period, but a lot of things affect me differently now.

He recalled the ‘daunting’ moment he introduced George to the world on the steps of the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, and made clear his determination to give his son as normal a life as possible.

Range of emotions: The Duke of Cambridge joked about the 'badge of honour' of changing his first nappy but also touched on more serious subjects like the preserving of endangered species in Africa

On leaving hospital, he said: ‘I think
 more shock and dauntingness [sic] was the feeling I felt but … I think I
 was on such a high anyway, and so was Catherine, about George that 
really we were happy to show him off to whoever wanted to see him.

‘As
 any new parent knows, you’re only too happy to show off your new child 
and, you know, proclaim that he is the best looking or the best 
everything.’

But asked 
whether he was comfortable with the experience, William admitted: ‘Again
 it’s not somewhere I enjoy being, [but] I know that the position I’m 
in ... that’s what’s required of me to do.

‘It’s
 nice that people want to see George, so, you know – I’m just glad he 
wasn’t screaming his head off the whole way through.’

The
 prince revealed that his decision to take the wheel as they drove away 
from hospital was intended as a public demonstration of his 
determination to do things his way.

Magic moment: A month ago the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, and the world got to see their newborn son and future king

Off home: Prince George cried lustily, like his father when he was born, as he was taken back to Kensington Palace by his parents after being born on July 22

As William hoisted George’s car seat into his Range Rover in front of the world’s media last month, every parent watching held their breath.

And when he did it perfectly, they knew his secret: practice.

William admitted: ‘I was terrified that … it was going to fall off or it wasn’t going to close properly. So, I had actually practised with that seat – but only once.’

He
 said: ‘Where I can be I am as independent as I want to be, the same as 
Catherine and Harry. We’ve all grown up differently to other 
generations. And I very much feel if I can do it myself, I want to do it
 myself.

‘And there are times where you can’t do it yourself and the system takes over or it’s appropriate to do things differently.

‘But,
 I think driving your son and your wife away from hospital was really 
important to me. And I don’t like fuss, so it’s much easier to just do 
it yourself.’

Asked by Mr 
Foster if he was sending a message to the world, he replied: ‘I think 
so. I’m just doing it the way I know … if it’s the right way then 
brilliant, if it’s not – if it’s the wrong way – then I’ll try to do it 
better.

‘But I’m reasonably 
headstrong about what I believe in, and what I go for, and I’ve got 
fantastic people around me who give me great support and advice.’

And he joked: ‘And I didn’t stall! It’s an automatic, so it’s alright.’

Asked about baby George’s character, William said affectionately: ‘Well, yeah – he’s a little bit of a rascal, put it that way.

‘So he either reminds me of my brother or me when I was younger. I’m not sure.

‘But he’s doing very well at the moment. He does like to keep having his nappy changed.’

And
 William confirmed that he changed his son’s first nappy while still at 
hospital, describing it as a nerve-wracking experience.

Doting dad: William described his son's birth and first month as 'emotional' and described George as a rascal who needs to sleep more

Prince William has said that he plans to
 start introducing Africa and its endangered species to George in
 his nursery at Kensington Palace at an early age.

Using toys and colourful interior design the Duke and Duchess want to 'make him grow up as if he’s in the bush.’

Prince William and Prince Harry carried out their first official tour together in 2010, spending six days Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa (top right)

They visited orphanages, schools and other important projects, as well as seeing the spectacular wildlife in the region.

William has said that he wants George to experience the same things and be inspired in the same way he was, starting with around his cot.

'I’ll have toy elephants and rhinos 
around the room.  We’ll cover it in sort of, you know, lots of bushes 
and things like that', he said.

‘I
 did the first nappy, yeah,’ he said. ‘A badge of honour, exactly. I 
wasn’t allowed to get away with that. I had every midwife staring at me,
 “You do it. You do it”.

‘He’s growing quite quickly actually. But he’s a little fighter. He kind of, he wriggles around quite a lot.

‘And
 he doesn’t want to go to sleep that much, which is a little bit of a 
problem ...’ Mr Foster asked: ‘So you’re up a little bit at night?’ ‘A 
little bit,’ William replied.

‘Not as much as Catherine. But, you know, she’s doing a fantastic job [she’s doing] very well.’

The
 couple are clearly making sure their cocker spaniel, Lupo, doesn’t feel
 neglected. He said: ‘For me, Catherine, and now little George are my 
priorities. And Lupo. He’s coping all right, actually. As a lot of 
people know who have got dogs and are bringing newborn back, they take a
 little bit of time to adapt, but, no he’s been all right so far.

‘He’s been slobbering sort of around the house a bit, so he’s perfectly happy.’

And
 although it was perhaps not terribly politically correct to admit it, 
William also joked that it would be a relief to return to work as an RAF
 Search and Rescue pilot based on Anglesey, North Wales.

He
 returned to work on August 7 after a fortnight’s statutory paternity 
leave, and was finally joined by Kate and their son early last week.

He
 said: ‘Well, as a few fathers might know, I’m actually quite looking 
forward to going back to work. Get some sleep. So I’m just hoping the 
first few shifts I go back I don’t have any night jobs.’

In depth: William and the CNN anchor walk the grounds of Kensington Palace, where Prince George will be brought up in the same flat once occupied by the Queen's sister Princess Margaret

Hopes: The Prince spoke of his desire to allow his son to see Africa and its amazing wildlife in the same way he and Prince Harry did as boys

Friendly: Journalist Max Foster with the prince, who spoke to CNN because he wanted to ensure more people in America and around the world heard about the work of Tusk

Having fun: Prince William tickles a young child in Lesotho, southern Africa, and the future king says he would like his son to experience the continent when he grows up

William
 also discussed his hope that one day Prince George will have the same 
love of Africa that he had Harry did as boys. His own passion for the 
continent was instilled in him by his father, Prince Charles, and his 
late mother Princess Diana.

William
 said he planned to introduce Africa and its endangered species to his 
young son in his Kensington Palace nursery at an early age.

Mr
 Foster said: ‘You talked about your father possibly whispering [sweet 
nothings] quietly in your ear as a young boy. Are you going to do the 
same for Prince George because it’s such a cause that you care so deeply
 about?’

William replied: 
‘Probably. I’ll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room. We’ll 
cover it in, you  know, lots of bushes and things like that. Make him 
grow up as if he’s in the bush.’

The full interview will be broadcast on CNN internationally on September 15 and in the UK on ITV at a later date.
