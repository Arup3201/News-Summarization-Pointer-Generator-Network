For those worried about eating their five a day, this vending machine could offer a helping hand.

Instead of dispensing junk food and fizzy drinks, it distributes vegetables to shoppers. 

The machine allows shoppers to pay between £3-£5 for a selection of locally-sourced produce, including bags of potatoes and mixed vegetable boxes. 

The Grewer Farm vending machine is proving a big hit in Dundee 

Popular: The dispenser has been installed at Overgate Shopping Centre in Dundee

It is the brainchild of farmers Pete and Euan Grewar, who trialled the dispenser at their East Ardler farm outside Blairgowrie, Angus, Scotland.

And so far, it has been a hit in Dundee, which was last year crowned the worst city in Scotland for child obesity.

A successful two-month trial period helped the cousins secure a deal for its installation in Overgate Shopping Centre.

A day after it was unveiled, shoppers had emptied some of the compartments. 

The modern machine, filled with potato bags and vegetable trays, was inspired by the traditional honesty box found on many farms.

A bag of potatoes costs £3, while a tray containing six free range eggs, six baking potatoes, a turnip, onions and carrots costs £5.

Shoppers insert their money into a slot and a corresponding compartment opens, containing their buy inside.

Pete Grewar, 36, who runs the farm  with his cousin Euan, 33, said: 'We've had a vending machine out the bottom of our farm road for two months and it has been very popular.

'Honesty boxes have been on farms for years so the machine is an extension of that.

'I think that it's a new way for people to have a direct link back to the farm where their vegetables are grown.

'People are moving more and more towards wanting a closer link with their food.

'Farm shops are becoming popular again and the machine is a way for people in the heart of a city to get fresh vegetables.'

The launch comes after statistics found that one in five primary one pupils in Dundee were overweight, obese or severely obese. It is believed that an unhealthy diet was a large factor contributing to the figures.

It was also discovered that Dundee was among the top 10 worst areas in the UK for heart health, with more than 250 deaths coronary heart disease every year. 

The vending machine is made by German company Roesler and can be used to vend a number of items.

Mr Grewar said the concept would be trialled for a further three months and could then be installed in other locations across Scotland if it proves to be popular.

He added: 'We thought we'd try it somewhere with more footfall and the Overgate Centre were very keen.

'We're looking to put them elsewhere and are open to all suggestions.'

Malcolm Angus, Overgate Centre Manager said: 'We were keen to support a local business with such an innovative idea.

'We are really happy to see how our shoppers have taken to the vegetable vending already with an encouraging start on day one.'

Fresh produce: The boxes cost between £3 and £5

Rachel Neary, marketing executive at the Overgate Centre, added: 'So far it's been really good. I walked past on Monday and could see that several of the boxes had already been bought.

'It's the only place in the centre where you can buy fresh produce, and it's local so we know exactly where it came from, even down to the specific field.

'The furthest away the food comes from is 15 miles. It's great.'

Dundee resident Jill Darling said: 'I do like the idea but I was hoping it would sell individual portions of fruit.

'I think it might work out very well because there is nothing else nearby where people can buy vegetables other than Lidl.

'It's a definite start and you know you are getting good produce.'
