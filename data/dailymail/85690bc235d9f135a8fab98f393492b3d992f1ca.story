The beauty queen arrested earlier this month for throwing homemade bombs from a moving car in a Utah suburb, stepped down from her position as Miss Riverton Tuesday in light of recent legal charges. The announcement was confirmed on the City of Riverton's website.

Speaking with KSL-TV and the Desert News, 18-year-old Kendra Gill explained why she was giving up her title.

'I just thought that it would be best for the city of Riverton and all the people affected by our decision and my choice to just step down and resign from my position and let someone else take it from here,' Gill said.

A 'stupid' mistake: Gill started crying as she explained her reasons for stepping down from her position Tuesday

Kendra McKenzie Gill, 18-year-old Utah beauty contest winner, was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs

Giving up her title: Gill said it took hard work to win the title of Miss Riverton, and the $2,000 scholarship that comes with it, so giving it all up was a difficult decision

On Friday Gill was formally charged with possession of an explosive device, along with friends Bryce Christopher Stone, John Patrick Reagh and Shanna Marie Smith. Felony bomb possession is punishable by 1 to 15 years in prison.

The 18-year-olds were arrested August 3 after driving around neighborhoods and allegedly tossing 8 oz plastic bottles filled with caustic chemicals at people they knew.

All four teens acknowledged they were tossing bombs powered by a toilet bowl cleaner reacting with aluminum foil on sidewalks, front yards or in streets 'to scare some of their other friends,' Unified Fire Authority investigator Steve Bowen said in a court affidavit.

'We don't really understand a clear reason for their behavior,' prosecutor Blake Nakamura said. 'The reason we charged them is obviously, what they possessed was indeed explosives, and we're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people, and therefore, had the potential to cause a great deal of harm.'

Gill is charged with manufacturing home-made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes

Gill called the act a 'stupid mistake' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone.

'We didn’t think about what we were doing at the time,' she said. 'We didn’t know that it would get to this point. We meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all.'

No one was injured in the incident, but that didn't get the teens off the hook.

'They were throwing them at both property and people,' Unified Fire Authority Capt. Clint Mecham told KUTV-TV. 'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.'

'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' Mecham told the television station. 'They can very easily cause serious harm or even death.'

Gill had just been crowned Miss Riverton and was supposed to go on to compete for the Miss Utah title before her arrest

On her side: Gill's attorney, left, thinks the charges are overkill. Her parents Michelle, second from right, and Gavin, right, defended their daughter's actions

Gill's attorney Wally Bugden thinks the charges are overkill and that her title of Miss Riverton is almost being held against her.

'You could say it's possible that the chemical could splash someone, but that certainly was not their intetion,' Bugden said. 'They weren't trying to harm anyone. They were playing a prank.'

Gill was crowned Miss Riverton, topping a slate of nine beauty contestants earlier this summer in the Salt Lake City suburb. She showed off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and took home a $2,000 scholarship.

It took a lot of hard work to win that title and scholarship, so giving it up was pretty difficult for Gill.

'I just (knew) … I would probably have to get it taken away from me, just because of the contract. So I’d rather have it be my decision now than to have someone take it from me,' she said.

One of Gill's friends claims they were throwing the bombs as a prank, however, authorities said someone could have been gravely injured by the explosives

Her parents also weighed in on the rebellious act. Her mother, Michelle Gill, said it was hard to get mad at her daughter knowing that her intentions were good.

Her father Gavin Gill described the past week the hardest of his life, but he's confident that the situation will sort itself out.

'I’m confident that the legal system will handle it correctly, and the people that understand the facts of what’s going on and the character of all four of the youngsters that are involved in this will see this and handle it appropriately,' he said.

Gill herself remains optimistic that the situation will be positive in the end.

'I do believe this whole thing is a way to help us grow and to learn from our mistakes and to move forward and just kind of get on with our lives.'
