She may be a successful entrepreneur with a dazzling career and A-list husband, but a few short years ago Millie Mackintosh started out as a makeup artist to Caggie Dunlop on Made In Chelsea.

The star, who now fronts glossy beauty campaigns and has her own range of false lashes, has opened up about how her passion for makeup began.

Speaking to Charlotte Tilbury, who treated the star to a glamorous makeover, Millie said: 'I wasn't very confident as a teenager so makeup was kind of like an escapism. I'd spend an hour or two hours doing it.

'I had really bad skin so I'd spend so long trying to cover it up and distract from the skin. I'd make my eyes amazing.'

Millie, who cites Brigitte Bardot and Kate Moss as her beauty icons, was treated to The Bombshell makeover by Charlotte - a high octane glamour look.

Charlotte, who works with Cara Delevingne and Kim Kardashian, used her own range of products, as well as Millie's lashes, to create a sixties feline flick and statement lips.

Loves her look: After Charlotte has worked her magic, Millie takes a look at her new look in a mirror and is overwhelmed

Speaking about the look she created for Millie, which is perfect for the Christmas party season, Charlotte said: 'Your social calendar is full of fabulous parties and a life of perfect decadence - Hollywood glamour, diamonds and champagne.

'You have the perfect rouge to match any outfit, accessorised with Louboutins, a Lulu Guiness clutch and a diamond as big as The Ritz. Your idols are the ultimate sirens of the silver screen: Liz Taylor, Marilyn Monroe and Veronica Lake. Your beauty mantra; Why be lazy when you can feel beautiful every day?'

After Charlotte has worked her magic, Millie takes a look at her new look in a mirror and is overwhelmed. 'I love it. Wow, that makeup is amazing. I feel like someone else, I'm going to wear this every day.' 

Style and beauty guru: Millie, who already has her own clothing range, is considering brining out a makeup range

Beauty guru Millie says that she's respectful to Stephen when it comes to storing her makeup.

'I have to be fair to Stephen, and so I keep it organised and out of the way, under our bed in pull out drawers – face, lips, and lashes,' she explained.

Keen to build up her brand, Millie is considering venturing into beauty. 'I love discovering the next big thing in beauty and I am definitely looking into it but I'm so busy at the moment.

'It would be a range of make-up combined with skincare,' she added.
