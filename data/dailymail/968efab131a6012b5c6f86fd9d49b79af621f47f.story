Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera will have to travel to Spain to give evidence in a match-fixing trial.

Herrera is one of 28 players who will be summoned to appear in court in Valencia in 2015 as the investigation into a match he played in May 2011 is heard.

His then-manager Javier Aguirre, who is currently coaching the Japanese national team, and Atletico Madrid captain Gabi are among those who will give evidence.

Zaragoza needed to win their last game of the 2010-11 season to stay up and beat Levante 2-1 away from home with Herrera playing 72 minutes before being substituted.

Herrera was on the verge of a move to Athletic Bilbao when the game was played and moved shortly after the season ended.

There were suspicions over the game before it was even played with Deportivo president Augusto Lendoiro (whose team ended up going down) hinting at foul play from then Zaragoza president Agapito Iglesias.

Iglesias remains at the centre of the anticorruption investigation and will also be called to give evidence.

Former Zaragoza captain Gabi, now at Atletico Madrid, admitted he received a sum of money from Iglesias

Last month Zaragoza captain Gabi admitted receiving a sum of money into his bank account from Iglesias in the week before the game. 

He says he was asked to draw this money out and return it in cash to his president.

And Herrera is believed to be one of seven other players who, along with coach Aguirre, also received a payment from the president.

Iglesias has claimed that the money was a bonus to the players. But Gabi is understood to have told investigators bonuses were never paid before games and that the sum was returned immediately to Iglesias.

Zaragoza were about to go into administration at the time and Gabi is understood to have told investigators he believed that the request from his president was related to this process, suggesting that the players were simply doing what the club had told them to do.

Gabi was one of several players interviewed in October but with the case now set to go to court Herrera will have to go to Valencia to give evidence and his then coach Aguirre will have to return from Japan and do likewise.

Former Zaragoza coach and current Japan manager Javier Aguirre is also said to have received money
