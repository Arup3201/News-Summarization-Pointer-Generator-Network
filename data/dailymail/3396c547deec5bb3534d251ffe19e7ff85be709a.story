Victim: Pamela Devitt, 63, pictured, was mauled to death by four pit bulls on May 9 and died on her way to hospital

A California man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after his pack of pit bulls attacked a 63-year-old female jogger, who later died of blood loss from some 200 puncture wounds.

Alex Jackson, 29, of Antelope Valley was booked on Thursday after his dogs, caught and impounded following the May 9 attack, tested positive to DNA belonging to victim, Pamela Devitt. He has also been charged with owner negligence, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office.

Jackson was initially arrested shortly after Devitt was killed while out for a jog near her home in Littlerock, but was later released on bail pending the DNA test results. He is now being held on more than $1 million bail.

According to CBS News, Devitt was 'dragged 50 yards, scalped and her arm removed' by the dogs.

The Los Angeles County Coroner later determined she died of 'blood loss attributed to sharp force trauma.'

'The sharp force trauma was caused by the dog attack in which the victim sustained approximately 150 to 200 puncture wounds,' said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Lt. John Corina.

Corina said a driver saw pit bulls attacking Devitt in the high 
desert community of Littlerock. The driver called 911 and honked her 
horn to try to get the dogs to stop.

An arriving deputy saw a single dog 
still attacking the runner and tried to chase it off, Corina 
said. The dog ran off into the desert, then turned around and attacked 
the deputy, who took a shot at the animal before it ran off.

Hours later, sheriff's and animal 
control officials served a search warrant on Jackson's home near the 
site of the attack and took away eight dogs, six pit bulls and two 
mixed-breeds.

Impounded: Eight dogs in total have been impounded from a nearby home. Alex Jackson was initially arrested then released before being arrested again on May 30

Vicious: DNA evidence proved four of the dogs carried out the violent attack

The dogs were kept under quarantine 
for rabies observation at a Lancaster shelter. Four of the pit bulls 
seized were believed to have attacked Devitt.

'Further examination of the pit bulls revealed they had what appeared to be blood on their coats and muzzles,' Corina told CBS.

Since January, authorities received 
at least three other reports of Jackson's dogs attacking other people, 
according to Robeson. Jackson is also facing several charges related to 
growing marijuana.

Devitt's husband earlier told KCAL-TV he blamed the dogs' owners for what happened.

'I
do not blame the dogs. I don't blame pit bulls,' Ben Devitt said. 'I 
blame people who don't take responsibility for their animals.'

Attacked: Pamela Devitt was killed by the pack of dogs while jogging near her home in Littlerock

Not
all of the dogs are licensed, spayed or neutered as required by county 
and state law, said Marcia Mayeda, the county's animal control director.

In
one of the state's most famous dog mauling cases, a San Francisco 
husband and wife were charged in the death of a neighbor in 2001.

Marjorie Knoller received a 15-years-to-life sentence.

In
rejecting her appeal, the California Supreme Court ruled that Knoller 
acted with a conscious disregard for human life when her 140-pound Presa
Canario escaped and killed Diane Whipple in an apartment building 
hallway.

Knoller's husband, Noel, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

According to authorities, Pamela Devitt died from her wounds on the way to hospital.

Following
the deadly attack, police warned residents in the city of Littlerock, 
about 40 miles northeast of the city of Los Angeles, to be wary.

Tony Bell, spokesman for Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, told NBC4 at the time how 
dangerous pit bulls could be.

'These pit bulls are a killing 
machines. They're different than other animals. They need to have 
enhanced enforcement on these particular animals,' he said.

Sheriff's
officials used a helicopter to search for the dogs. 

'In these areas, you might have a situation where people dump animals out in rural areas,' said John Mlynar, a spokesman for the nearby city of Palmdale.

He added that he'd never heard of an attack like that of May 9.

Residents who live near the site of the attack said stray dogs are constantly roaming the area and have attacked people before.

'It's really scary,' Diane Huffman, of Littlerock, told KABC-TV. 'I don't know what to think. I really think I'm going to be getting a gun to protect myself.'
