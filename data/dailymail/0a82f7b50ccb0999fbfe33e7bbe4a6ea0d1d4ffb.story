Touching: This 1948 photo of the Queen and Prince Philip with Prince Charles was sent to the royal midwife

The collection, which also includes never-before-seen items belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, was amassed by Devonshire royal 'ephemera expert', Jim Hanson.

'Jim Hanson was an extraordinary collector,' explains auctioneer James Grinter, who will sell the collection at Reeman Dansie’s Royal memorabilia sale in Colchester on February 17th.

'He started from an early age collecting cheese labels, before moving on to marbles which he traded in the school playground.

'After giving up farming in Devon in the late 1970s he concentrated on travelling the world, trading and exhibiting stamps, and then turned his attention to royal memorabilia in his later years, before his death.' 

Although many of Mr Hanson's items are royal menus, it is the collection of telegrams that is likely to attract the most interest.

One of the most touching is from a well-wisher to Sister Helen Rowe, the midwife who helped deliver all four of Her Majesty's children.

An original Post Office telegram addressed to 'Sister Helen Rowe, Buckingham Palace, London' on November 14, 1948, the day Prince Charles was born, reads: 'Grand news. Please convey loyal congratulations. Billy.'

It was accompanied by a photograph of the proud Queen and Prince Philip taken exactly a month later cradling the new-born heir to the throne at Buckingham Palace following his christening.

Another lot likely to attract significant interest is a rare black and white portrait photograph of a relaxed Princess Diana, signed ‘Diana 1993’.

Presented in a silver arched top presentation frame engraved with her crowned ‘D’ cipher, it is estimated to sell for between £3,000 and £3,500.

There are also two handwritten letters Diana sent to her friend John Gairdner, a London Fashion Week producer, thanking him for sending her 'gorgeous flowers' to Highgrove and Kensington Palace on her birthdays in 1988 and 1990.

The pair became friends after the fashion entrepreneur,  a director for designer shoemaker Charles Jourdan in the 1980s, styled himself Diana’s 'royal footman' after sending her a wedding trousseau of shoes.

Also included in the auction is an original Order of Service, photos, invitations and menus for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 2011.

The wedding breakfast menu reveals their guests sat down to an elaborate starter of marinated South Uist salmon, Lyme Bay crab and wild Hebridean langoustines, served with a 2009 Meursault.

For the main course, they were served Saddle of North Highland Mey select organic lamb, with Highgrove Spring vegetables, English asparagus, Jersey Royal potatoes and Sauce Windsor, accompanied by a 2004 Pomerol.

And they finished with a trio of Berkshire honey ice cream, sherry trifle and chocolate parfait, washed down with Laurent Perrier Rose champagne and followed by coffee or fresh mint tea.

Rarer still is a signed photograph of Queen Victoria, showing her  with her sons and three future kings, King Edward VII, King George V, and King Edward VIII.

An extremely rare menu from the dinner King Edward VIII held the night before he announced his abdication is also due to go under the hammer.

Edward convened the crucial dinner at his Fort Belvedere home in Windsor Great Park for his closest royal advisers and Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as he wrestled with his decision to abdicate in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

The menu, which bears the King’s ER cipher and is dated 8.12.1936, reveals they dined on Creme d’Epinards, Mousse de Sole Victoria, Filet de Boeuf and Souffle Alexander as they discussed the looming constitutional crisis.

'It is extraordinary to find a menu from such a crucial moment in the history of the British monarchy has survived - and in such excellent condition,' comments Grinter.

A colour photograph of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor with four of their beloved pug dogs in the garden of their French country home is also included in the auction, as are photographs of the couple at their Paris town house in the Bois de Boulogne.

One silver-edged menu bearing the Duke’s cipher from their Bois de Boulogne residence and dated October 20, 1957, shows they dined on Mousse de Gaumon Fumee, followed by a Mixed Grill and Coeur a la Creme.

A gold-edged menu card bearing a gold crown cipher dated 21.10.1965 reveals the Windsors’ guests enjoyed Carre d’Agneau Rotir with puréed haricots verts followed by a selection of cheeses.

Another lot reveals how the King conducted his secret affair with his previous married mistress, Freda Dudley Ward in 1919, as the 24-year-old Edward, Prince of Wales.

The future couple met in a doorway in London’s Mayfair in 1918 as they sheltered from a Zeppelin raid. 

Socialite Mrs Dudley Ward, 23, had already been married for five years and had two daughters by a husband 16 years her senior, but that didn’t stop Edward from showering her with letters and gifts.

One of the former is included in the auction and takes the form of a handwritten pencil note, dispatched to Mrs Dudley Ward on 28th May 1919.

It is addressed to 'My very own darling precious little Fredie' and signs off with Edward's pet name, 'Your very own devoted and adoring little David.'

The relationship with Mrs Dudley Ward continued for over a decade, eventually ending in 1934 when the future Duke of Windsor met Wallis Simpson.

In another rare lot, there are two original cheques personally signed by the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and drawn on Messrs Drummond bank, which also held the accounts of King George III, Disraeli, Gainsborough and Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

Both cheques are signed Elizabeth R. One for £495.75p is dated 1974 and is made out to the royal milliner Rudolf Ltd.

The other, for £250 and dated 1978, is made out to Lady Katharine Seymour, the Queen Mother’s lady-in-waiting.

There is also a handwritten letter from the Queen Mother to dressmaker Madame Elizabeth Handley Seymour in 1937 describing her preferred design for her gown for King George VI’s Coronation after King Edward VIII’s abdication.

Writing in the third person, she noted: 'The Queen is writing a line to Madame Handley Seymour to tell her that the dress for the Coronation (according to precedent) ought to be beautifully embroidered by some school of needlework. So that the Queen thinks that the Royal School of Needlework ought to do the embroidery ... '

'It is very rare to find such a remarkable royal collection as this,' adds Grinter. 'It spans 200 years from Queen Victoria, through King Edward VII, King George V, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, King George VI and the Queen Mother and our current Queen. 

'The breadth, quality and condition of the individual items is amazing.'
