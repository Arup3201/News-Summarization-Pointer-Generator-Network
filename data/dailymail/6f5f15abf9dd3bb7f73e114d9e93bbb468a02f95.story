Hot diggity dog! 

The former home of Oscar G. Mayer Sr., son of the man who established the Oscar Mayer Company, is now up for grabs. 

The $1.75 million Evanston, Illinois, home features six bedrooms and four bathrooms, plus 7,401 square feet, according to its listing.

Many of the 1903 home's windows are boarded up - indeed, its listing says 'Elegance of a bygone era is still there, but much work needs to be done to restore to previous grandeur.

'Amazing original woodwork and stairway. Being sold in "as is' condition."

The listing says Mayer occupied the residence for 18 years, from 1927 all the way to 1965. Mayer died in March of that year.

His father Oscar F. Mayer established the Oscar Mayer Company, Crain's Business Chicago reported last month.  Oscar G. Mayer Sr. grew up to eventually serve as chairman.

Former resident Sigmund Eisenschenk's estate is selling the home, according to the website. The estate special administrator Peter J. Schmeidel told Crain's that the home's sale was accepted by a judge in autumn 2014.

Evanston History Center's Krist Hartzell told the website the home was built in 1901 and was a Hallburg & Sturm creation. 

She also told the website there is a curved tower inside the home as well as a ballroom. Hartzell said she didn't believe the home will be knocked down, since it is a local landmark.

'There's been a lot of buzz and concern for this house... everyone was concerned no one was taking care of it and that it was going to deteriorate beyond the point of repair,' she told Crain's Chicago Business. 'We're pleased that it's on the market.'

The first of the company's famed Wienermobiles was created in 1936, and its 'Oh, I'd love to be an Oscar Mayer wiener. That is what I'd truly like to be' song first appeared in 1963, the company says. 

His son, Oscar G. Mayer Jr., later served as company chairman, retired in 1977, and died in 2009 according to the Associated Press.

Former owner: Oscar G. Mayer Sr. died in March 1965, after living in this home for 18 years
