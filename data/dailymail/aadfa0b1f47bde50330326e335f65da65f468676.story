A picture of a man dressed in a sinister clown costume taken from a Facebook page called 'Spot the Burnley Clown' which has sparked panic after social media users falsely claimed he was terrorising the area

Police have been bombarded with frantic calls from the public after a Facebook site about a mystery clown sparked panic across four towns and villages.

The page called 'Spot the Burnley Clown' was set up to detail the movements of its creator as he paraded around areas of the Lancashire town dressed in an orange wig, painted face and fancy dress clothing.

But despite there being no sightings of the clown in the flesh, the page sparked frenzied gossip on the social media network with stories falsely claiming the joker was armed with a baseball bat was hiding in bushes ready to mug people.

The exaggerated stories spread panic across Burnley and the nearby towns of Blackburn and Clitheroe plus the village of Sabden.

Fearing a madman was on the loose like Pennywise, the killer clown from the Stephen King horror TV series It, dozens of calls were made to Lancashire police to alert them.

Teachers at primary schools were understood to have contacted police after concerned parents said their children were being frightened by reports.

Twitter users claimed the clown had been knocking on windows and mugging people, but police said no sightings had been reported since the rumours surfaced.

Officers said reports had been made from 'well meaning' people but said most were as a result of 'third hand' information.

The fear of clowns is known as coulrophobia which adults and children can suffer from.

Today,
 Lancashire Police said: 'Over the last couple days, police have 
received a number of calls from concerned members of the public in 
Burnley and the surrounding areas with regards to a man dressed as a 
clown reportedly in possession of a baseball bat.

No sightings: These pictures were also posted on the Facebook page, but it is unclear whether they are of the same man.  Police they are not taking any action because the reports are based on 'third-hand information'

'The calls have come as a result of various postings on Facebook as well as a dedicated page Spot the Burnley Clown, with comments becoming more and more exaggerated.

'We would like to reassure people that there is no foundation for any of these reports and we have had no first-hand reports of any incidents of violence or intimidation.

'We would urge people to only report first-hand instances of suspicious behaviour and try to avoid repeating gossip and third hand information.

'When people start to talk about incidents like this on social media, without any malicious intent, stories can become confused and sometimes exaggerated and people should bear this in mind.'

The Facebook page has a series of posts from a man claiming to be the clown.

One read: 'I am sorry to everyone I scared tonight. I will keep my clownings to the parks from now on. Now i have to go to bed but I hope you all have a clowning good day tomorrow.'

But he followed that up with: 'Will everyone stop being mean. I am a friend clown not a bad clown that is why I hide in bushes and behind trees where you least expect so I dont scare anyone.'

His last message read: 'Am home now. I cleaned some peoples windows but they said to go away but I said I am a clown here to help everyone needs a clown in their life.

'Now I am at home maybe I will go out again later. I am your local neighbourhood friendly clown woof woof.'

But one Facebook poster said: 'He’s one sad person who needs to grow up.'

Another said: Omg this is well bad! Paedophiles will be doing this to lure kids in. Sick - you should be ashamed.'

But another replied saying: 'Keep up the good work clown. If I see you about I’ll get you a custard pie.'

Inspector Zeg Awan of Lancashire Police said: 'We are not treating it with a degree of importance.

'When it comes down to it, there have been no reported concerns about violence. It seems to be a trend that has originated elsewhere with someone basically playing hide and seek.

'One caller said a clown was hiding up a tree but that turned out to be false.'

The scare mirrors an incident in 
September this year when a man dressed as clown in Northampton terrified
 residents by standing on street corners, sparking numerous copycat 
incidents.

Northampton 
University student Alex Powell, 22, later admitted responsibility for 
the saga.

But since then there have been sightings of clowns in 
Chesterfield, Mansfield and Doncaster.

The Northampton Clown has been a mystery since appearing on the streets on Friday September 13

Mr Powell said not everyone has seen the funny side of his antics and he has even been sent more than 1,000 death threats on Facebook.

The clown would also tease fans with clues on the page about where he would appear next.

After rumours that he was carrying a knife, the clown told a local newspaper anonymously: 'I just wanted to amuse people.

'Most people enjoy being a bit freaked out and then they can laugh about it afterwards.

'It's like watching a horror movie. When people get scared they usually start laughing.'
