In X-Men, Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, a mutant with claws that fly from the back of his hands and a skeleton coated in super-strength adamantium.

Inspired by this, a plumber from Lincolnshire has created a pair of Wolverine-inspired claws complete with 12-inch stainless steel blades.

Not only do they automatically extend and retract, like Jackman’s claws in the film, they are so sharp they have been used to slice watermelon and rip card from a distance.

The 12-inch metal claws were built by 32-year-old plumber Colin Furze, pictured, from Lincolnshire. Each claw consists of three blades made from 2mm-thick stainless steel

Colin Furze began by using metal work to build and sharpen the blades.

These blades were attached to metal mounts that are fitted to his arms, and a plate mounted to his hands. 

Attached to the end of each blade are valves, wired up to an air tank worn in a backpack.

When
 wearing the Wolverine system, Furze can press a button to fire air from
 the tank through the valves and propel the claws forward.

A 
spring-loaded mechanism attached to another firing switch retracts the claws back into their housing.  

The claws were built by YouTube star Colin Furze, who has previously built a turbojet engine, vacuum shoes and hacked a mobility scooter.

Furze began by using metal work to build and sharpen the blades.

These blades were then attached to metal mounts, fitted to his arms, and a plate around his hand.

Attached to the end of each blade are valves, wired up to an air tank worn in a backpack.

When wearing the Wolverine system, Furze can press a switch to fire air from the tank through the valves and propel the claws forward.

spring-loaded mechanism attached to another firing switch retracts the claws back into their housing.  

To make the Wolverine system, Furze tried a number of different methods to propel the blades forward including motorised rigs, before settling on the air tank.  

Furze's claws were inspired by X-Men character Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, pictured. In the film, Wolverine, also known as James 'Logan' Howlett, is a mutant with bone claws that fire from his hands. During an experiment, his skeleton, including these claws, are coated in super-strength, fictitious adamantium

He also paid particularly close attention to the way in which the claws appeared. In the films, the blades are slim and discreet, and are designed to extend to different lengths.

Furze said: ‘The blade spread was a must as parallel blades would just look wrong.

'If I wasn't bothered about this I could have made the blades thicker and stronger, but they would look rubbish, so 2mm stainless steel had just the right amount of flex but still enough strength not to fold on impact.

‘When the claws are retracted they compress together into their housing, which is what you can hear when they’re firing out.’ 

These blades are wired to an air 
tank fitted to a backpack. They are controlled by firing switches on the
 plate mounted to Furze's hands and extend and retract at the press of a button, pictured

He added that he is pleased with discreet firing switches, but said that the system could be improved if the plate wasn’t mounted to the top of his hand.

‘But without this the whole device would move around your forearm and then you have blades firing in odd directions and possibly into the back off my hand, so it shall stay’, continued Furze.

Addressing the bulky backpack, Furze added: ‘The main downer to this system is really the air tank and valves you need to carry to operate them, which means you have a rucksack on all the time.

'But the pros outweigh the cons as it 
works every time, costs nothing to recharge and can increase the speed 
by charging with greater pressure.

‘The
 system is just a few basic slots and holes drilled between plates so 
when clamped or welded together form an internal pathway.

The
 project took about two weeks to complete and Furze has posted a video 
explaining the design and build process on his YouTube channel.

Furze said: 'The spread was a must as parallel blades would look wrong. I could have made the blades thicker and stronger but 2mm stainless steel had the right amount of flex but enough strength'

Speaking 
to the MailOnline, Furze said: 'I've been meaning to build some of these
 for a while as I've seen some pretty rubbish attempts and thought I 
could do way better, and with the new film jogging my memory there's no 
better time.'As of yet 
I've not caught myself but there have been a few near misses, there not 
mega sharp though as these are for show not for fighting anti-mutant 
people.

'The
 only thing I'd improve is a smaller air tank as wolverine is not known 
for wearing a rucksack but I could be holiday wolverine!'

Hollywood author and frontier scientist James A. Conrad has compiled a list of four psychic powers seen in the X-Men movies that he claims 'even an inventive teenager might be able to crack and join the ranks of the world's billionaires'.

Telekinesis

Magneto of the X-Men can levitate and cause motion in both metallic and nonmetallic objects at will, the latter using the principle of diamagnetism.

Products are already on the market, including toys, that simulate a telekinesis-like effect, but they rely on brain-computer interface technology.

According to Conrad: 'If you can successfully and repeatedly demonstrate an act of telekinesis – that is, make an object move with just the power of your mind – and supply learning instructions so that others can do it, the value would be $100 billion in U.S. dollars, provided you don't mind selling your breakthrough knowledge to the government.'

Telepathy

Dark intentions aside, it could be useful and a valuable talent, with appropriate legal authorisation, to read someone's mind or transfer a thought or emotion to someone's consciousness the way that Charles Xavier, wealthy leader of the X-Men does it, explained Conrad.

Secrets hidden in the mind of a terrorist or kidnapper could be obtained quickly to save lives, while victims trapped in rubble could be located by their thoughts alone and mentally sent a reassuring message that help is on the way.

Accelerated healing

Wolverine's body has the ability to heal bullet wounds fast without the slightest trace of scars.

In the real world, bodies are in a constant state of gradual regeneration, but if we suffer too great a physical injury or too many smaller injuries, present human physiology cannot handle the increased workload.

Some animals can regenerate entire severed limbs or tails. Scientists have been researching how to adapt those abilities for human use, but it is difficult transferring genetic traits from one species to another.

Scientists have also been researching ways for human cells to undergo changes so that they can be used for other purposes in the body in processes called dedifferentiation, transdifferentiation and reprogramming.

Consciousness time travel

In X-Men: Days of Future Past, Kitty Pryde uses her phasing powers to send the consciousness of Wolverine back in time to his 1973 body.

People would not need to achieve physical time travel to become wealthy, noted Conrad: 'Sending a numerical thought message to yourself one to two hours in the past would enable you to unscrupulously win the National Lottery, Euromillions, Mega Millions and Powerball, at least until new laws were passed to prevent such an unfair advantage.'
