At first glance, you'd think the Red Arrows had set their smoke to gold and loop-the-looped a purple night sky, leaving luminous trails in their wake.

But this is no RAF display team of turbo jets.

In fact, this photograph captures a flock of seagulls soaring over Rome, with a camera method that transforms the flight of the birds into delicate wisps of light.

This photograph taken with a slow exposure captures seagulls darting across a night sky in Rome. This method of photography results in their flight paths turning gold

Photographer Gabriel Bouys caught the
outline of an Italian rooftop in the bottom in his frame- a dark 
silhouette against an incandescent sky.

The seagulls are captured darting 
through the sky and circling an aerial. Their flight paths are 
illuminated as a result of the light that has been absorbed by the 
camera lens before the moment was captured.

Long-exposure photography aims to blur and obscure the moving parts in a photograph, as the seagulls are in this picture.

The paths of moving sources stand 
out in this form of photography, becoming clearer than the elements 
around them. Long exposures are easiest to achieve at night-time or when
the subject is a lot brighter than its background.

The camera's shutter stays open for longer, so more light is absorbed and a brighter image is produced.

Long-exposure photography is becoming
popular for its ability to turn everyday objects into romantic 
portraits and capture sources of light in great detail

The photographer passed up a view of Rome's St Peter's Basilica over the River Tiber and looked to the night sky for a breathtaking photograph

How we usually see them: Seagulls fill the sky in Morocco, gliding with outstretched wings
