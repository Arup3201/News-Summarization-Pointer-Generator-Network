Diet disaster: Hayley Morris, 59, has ended up 10 stone heavier than when she started dieting

In her conquest to get slim, one woman has ended up ten stone heavier.

Hayley Morris has been on a diet for three-quarters of her life - losing a staggering 27 stone over a 40-year period.

However, the 'yo-yo' nature of her dieting has meant that she has actually ended up 10 stone heavier than when she began.

In a Channel 5 documentary aired tonight, the 59-year-old tells of how she would go through spells of losing weight - only to pile it all (and more) back on.

‘I
 was addicted to food and this is what scuppered every diet,' says Ms Morris, who weighed 12 stone at the age of 15.

'In the 
past, if I had any problem, my excuse was to overeat – it was the only 
thing in my life I could control at times.

‘I would also write off 
the whole day if it started badly food-wise. Breakfast tended to be four
 or five slices of toast, then more pasta and bread throughout the day.'

Ms Morris blames yo-yo dieting for the fact she reached 26 stone at the age of 32 - adding: 'It was like an illness – but I had no-one to blame but myself.’

Now, after developing diabetes and suffering a heart attack, she 
is desperately trying to adopt a healthier lifestyle and shed the pounds 
before her weight kills her.

Tonight's documentary 
will uncover the 
depressing truth of weight loss - that within one year of their diet, 80
 per cent of people will gain weight, often more than they lost.

The average diet lasts just five and a half weeks, and the average woman 
will embark on 61 diets in her lifetime - spending around 31 years of her
 life trying unsuccessfully to lose weight.

As well as Ms Morris, viewers will meet Claudia Connell, who has 
accepted the only way she will ever be thin is to ‘starve herself – and I
 can’t do that’.

Addicted to yo-yo dieting: Viewers also meet Claudia Connell who has gone up and down six dress sizes over the last two decades. This is her at her thinnest

Struggle: Ms Connell admits the real reason for her weight gain is because she lacks willpower  - but also because 'it's very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight'

Ms Connell has gone up and down five dress sizes over the last two decades. She was
 a size eight until the age of 30, but then gained four stone over the 
next eight years.

She then dropped to under eight stone before piling on
 the pounds to go up to a size 18.

She admits the real reason for her
 weight gain is because she lacks willpower - but also because she is addicted to the buzz of yo-yo dieting.

'It’s 
very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight,' she says. 'There is that feeling of euphoria when you get down to a size
 12 or 14 that’s addictive. 

Opening up: Big Brother's Josie Gibson admits she has battled with her weight since she was six. She is now at her slimmest, but says she is terrified about piling the pounds back on - like 80 per cent of dieters

'It wouldn’t be exciting if you could always 
fit into size 10 jeans.’

Despite this, Ms Connell says she wants to cry at 
pictures of herself looking ‘morbidly obese’ and is terrified of being 
‘the fat person on the bus taking up the seat’.

And
 like many failed slimmers, the list of diets she has tried is endless, 
ranging from cabbage, grapefruit to one that involved eating anything 
red – ‘I ended up eating fruit gums’, she admits.

Viewers also meet 23-year-old Gemma, whose mother was paying her to lose weight even when she was at primary school.

By the age of 11 she weighed a staggering 18 stone – and she’s been battling the weight ever since.

Yo-yo: After appearing on Big Brother in 2010, Josie shed four stone - but piled it all back on when she broke her ankle. She is now a svelte size 10

‘I
 go on crazy diets like the cup-a-soup one, where I lost two stone in a 
month – but I put it back on as soon as I finished,’ she says, now 
weighting 24 stone.

‘I am an emotional eater and it’s sticking with the 
diet that’s the problem.’

Ms Connell is having more success – but even she fears it will be short-lived.

‘I’ve
 lost one-and-a-half stone in two months, but I know I will put it back 
on,’ she admits. ‘Starvation is what it takes for me to be thin  - and I
 just can’t starve myself.’

And
 it's not just ordinary women who are battling to avoid being in the 80 
per cent of people who gain weight after slimming down.

Big Brother star Josie Gibson is among numerous celebrities to have had a 
well-documented battle with yo-yo diets.

At 28 years old and a size 10, Josie is the slimmest she has ever been – but she admits it is a daily battle.

‘I
 am obsessed with food – I love it, have no “off” button and lick the 
plate,’ the Big Brother star tells the documentary.

‘At times I’ve been so desperate to stop eating that I’ve 
left the dinner table and gone and put a bikini on for 20 minutes. But it still doesn’t work.’

After appearing on Big Brother in 2010, Josie shed four stone – but piled it all back on when she broke her ankle.

Having
 worked so hard, she admits she felt suicidal about her weight gain – having 
battled with her figure since the age of six and ballooning to 19 stone 
by the age of 18.

‘People would text me saying “go and hang yourself, you whale” – it was horrific.' she says.

Over
 the years, she tried everything to shed the pounds – from fad diets to 
weight loss pills.

‘They were meant to flush out fat but left me with 
spag bol in my pants,’ she candidly tells viewers.

Now a svelte size
 10, she has thrown away her fat clothes and is studying to become a 
personal trainer in a desperate attempt to stay slim – given that fact 
she can ‘put on half a stone in weekend’.

Other famous yo-yo dieters include Natalie Cassidy, Kerry Katona and Steps' 
Claire Richards.
