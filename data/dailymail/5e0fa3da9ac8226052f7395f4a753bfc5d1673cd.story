Police say a drug rivalry and a fight last month led to a shooting outside a Pittsburgh high school this afternoon that left three students wounded.

The teens, two age 17 and one 16, were ambushed by rivals as they walked to their cars after getting out of Brashear High School in Pittsburgh's inner-city Beechview neighborhood.

Police have identified the gunman as Anjohnito 'A.J.' Willet, a 16-year-old former classmate of the wounded students. He has been charged with attempted murder.

Dozens of heavily-armed SWAT officers flooded the area and the high school went into lock down as police searched for the shooters.

Six people have been taken into custody, although no one has yet been charged. Those taken to police headquarters include a small child, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports.

Wounded: A 17-year-old boy was grazed by a bullet in the head, another student, age 16, received a graze wound to the leg and foot, and a third, also a 16-year-old, was struck in the neck

Bad blood: The shootings were thought to be drug-related and stemmed from an October 18 fight at Brashear High School

Parents panicked as news spread about the shooting, which happened just before 3pm as students were leaving school.

The teens were ambushed less than a block from the school. A security guard found one of the students, who had been shot in the head, and brought him back to campus.

A teacher dragged him inside the school and put pressure on the gunshot wound as other adults locked the doors and told other students who remained inside to hide in classrooms.

One of the students was shot in the neck and shoulder. One was grazed in the head. A third student was shot in the foot.

None of the injuries appear to be life-threatening. All three students are recovering at a local hospital.

Police say the ambush appears to be retaliation for an October 18 fight at the school between Willet and at least one of the victims - an incident that resulted in the school being on lock-down for a week.

Manhunt: The victims were rushed to area hospitals are police launched a search for the gunman in the woods

Police quickly swarmed the area outside the school where the students were shot

Officers gathered in the neighborhood outside the high school where the students were shot. The search for the gunmen resulted in six arrests

The increased security only ended when one of the participants dropped out of the school.

After the shooting, heavily-armed SWAT officers flooded the area.

Within two hours, police had surrounded two homes about a mile from the scene of the shooting.

At around 4.30pm, police announced that a
SWAT 
team took five men, a woman and a young child into custody following 
standoff on Rockland Avenue. The six adults are considered persons of 
interest, but so far no charges have been filed.

‘All I heard were gunshots.  I just thought it was kids playing 
around.  My friend said, “A kid is laying on the ground, and there is 
blood.” Everyone started running,’ senior Krystal Henson told Channel 
11.

Brashear senior Cody Muller, 18, told the Los Angeles Times on the phone that that he heard three or four gunshots as he was walking out of school.

He said he saw a gym teacher wrapping her hooded sweatshirt around a wounded junior who was bleeding from the head.

‘As
she was pressing it on his head, all I saw was blood running down the 
side of his head, it was all over the hoodie, it was on the ground,’ 
Muller said. “They were asking him questions, he wasn’t aware that he 
was shot.’

Police told KDKA that three armed men walked out of
the nearby woods at 2.50pm as students were streaming out of Brashear 
at the end of the school day.

The shooters were described as three men wearing all black, The trio then reportedly ran back into the woods behind the school.

Pittsburgh police said the shooting may be in retaliation for a fight that broke out at the school October 18 - possibly drug-related - which resulted in a week-long lockdown.

Brashear High School, located at 590 Crane Avenue in the Beechview section of Pittsburgh, is a magnet school for computer science.

'It's just really sad that children can't go to school and be safe. I hope they catch whoever did this,' Pittsburgh Public Schools board president Sharene Shealey told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 'I hope those kids are OK, and I'm praying for their families.'

Nearly 1,500 students are currently enrolled in the school, making it the biggest public high school in the city.

Part of Brashear also houses South Hills Middle School, which has 580 students. The entire school complex has been placed on lockdown.

In 2010, U.S. News and World Report awarded Brashear a Bronze Medal in its America's Best High Schools list.
