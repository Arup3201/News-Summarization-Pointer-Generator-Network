The White House released a letter Tuesday handwritten by President Obama and dedicated to the memory of Abraham Lincoln and his historic Gettysburg Address.

Just like the unforgettable speech, Obama’s letter contains 272 words and became public on the 150th anniversary of the day Lincoln honored the soldiers who died in the Civil War bloodbath.

It also comes at a time when Obama is facing disastrous approval ratings and amid criticism he’s taken for choosing not to attend a Gettysburg memorial.

Honoring a leader: The White House released a handwritten essay President Obama wrote commemorating Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Like Lincoln's speech, Obama's address has exactly 272 words

Four score and 70 years ago: Tuesday was the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's historic speech. Obama has faced criticism for not attending a memorial at the historic battlefield and for omitting 'under God' during a recitation of the address

Obama has also been attacked for failing to say the words ‘under God’ during a recent recitation of the address.

But the letter, which Obama seems to have written himself, appears to be an means of laying to rest any possibility that the president has anything but respect and admiration for the Great Emancipator.

‘I sometimes walk down the hall to a room Abraham Lincoln used as his office,’ the letter reads. ‘It contains an original copy of the Gettysburg Address, written in Lincoln's own hand.’

In his own handwritten script, Obama highlights an excerpt from Lincoln’s speech that he most often lingers on: A new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

‘Lincoln grasped, perhaps more than anyone, the burdens required to give these words meaning,’ the President writes. ‘He understood as well that our humble efforts, our individual ambitions, are ultimately not what matter; rather, it is through the accumulated toil and sacrifice of ordinary men and women…that this country is built, and freedom preserved.’

Obama, whose spokesman claims he was reading from a so-called ‘Nicholay copy,’ of the address when he omitted a shout out to God, finishes his letter with a nod to healing wounds.

‘But Lincoln's words give us confidence that whatever trials avoid us, this nation and the freedom we cherish can, and shall, prevail.’

In the evening, when Michelle and the girls have gone to bed, I sometimes walk down the hall to a room Abraham Lincoln used as his office. It contains an original copy of the Gettysburg Address, written in Lincoln's own hand.I linger on these few words that have helped define our American experiment: "a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."Through the lines of weariness etched in his face, we know Lincoln grasped, perhaps more than anyone, the burdens required to give these words meaning. He knew that even a self evident truth was not self executing; that blood drawn by the lash was an affront to our ideals; that blood drawn by the sword was in painful service to those same ideals.He understood as well that our humble efforts, our individual ambitions, are ultimately not what matter; rather, it is through the accumulated toil and sacrifice of ordinary men and women -- those like the soldiers who consecrated that battlefield -- that this country is built, and freedom preserved. This quintessentially self made man, fierce in his belief in honest work and the striving spirit at the heart of America, believed that it falls to each generation, collectively, to share in that toil and sacrifice.Through cold war and world war, through industrial revolutions and technological transformations, through movements for civil rights and women's rights and workers rights and gay rights, we have. At times, social and economic change have strained our union. But Lincoln's words give us confidence that whatever trials avoid us, this nation and the freedom we cherish can, and shall, prevail.
