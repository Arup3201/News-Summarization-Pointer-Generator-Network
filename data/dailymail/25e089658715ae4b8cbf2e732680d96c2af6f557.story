It's the TV show that lets us watch fellow viewers watching the same programmes as us - but tonight the Gogglebox stars will be watching themselves on the box.

In tonight's final episode of the award-winning Channel 4 series, the Gogglebox families will watch themselves winning a Bafta.

Unemployed Scarlett Moffatt, who 'jumped up in disbelief' at landing the award, said she received a text from the Tapper family in north London saying: 'We've only gone and f***ing done it'.

Scarlett Moffatt, from Darlington, Co Durham, will be shown watching her show Gogglebox win a Bafta tonight

The 23-year-old, who lives in Co Durham, will be shown watching the film and television awards with her parents, Betty and Mark Moffatt, at home in Darlington, Co Durham.

Scarlett and her family feature alongside other Gogglebox families including couch potatoes Linda, Pete and George Gilbey from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, Jewish couple, Jonathan and Nikki Tapper and their teenage children from north London, and 'posh couple' Dom and Steph Parker, from Sandwich, Kent.

Scarlett said what made the show popular was the fact that it showed 'normal' people watching television.

'You can relate to the characters and feel like you're invited into our front rooms', she told the Daily Star.

Last month, the show was hit by a fakery row when one of its stars claimed that the programme was scripted, with families being fed funny comments and told which scenes to react to.

A cast member, who asked not to be named, told a newspaper: 'I have decided to speak out as a few people have started to comment on Twitter that there are things on the show that look fake. Well, they are right. We don’t film across the week. You set aside a night for filming and it can go on for hours.

‘We also keep changing clothes, food and drinks to make it look like we’re filmed on different nights.

Scarlett said she received a text from the Jewish Tapper family in north London celebrating the show's win

Snooty? Gogglebox's 'posh couple', Steph and Dom Parker, don't talk to Scarlett, she said

‘Sometimes we are told "Louis Walsh is going to say something shocking on X Factor so we want you to react to that".

‘If you can’t think of anything, the producers come up with  a joke. If you fluff it they film it again.’

Scarlett said this was untrue, saying the only thing the show's producers paid for was the occasional takeaway and electricity bill.

This week, it was revealed that the home of the show's 'posh couple', Dom and Steph Parker, was used for an upmarket sex party organised by a friend of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Private swingers' club, Killing Kittens, run by Emma Sayle, who was at Downe House School with Kate Middleton, held a £500-a-ticket orgy at the Parkers' £3.5million mansion, The Salutation, last weekend.

The Parkers are known for roaring with laughter as they knock back vats of red wine and vodka from their cream sofa.

But Scarlett said they were her least favourite Gogglebox stars, saying they were the only ones on the show who didn't speak to the others.

Admitting she had to put on subtitles to understand their upper class accents, she said: 'I think they don't want to because we're working class.  They're too posh for our banter.'

And she said if the couple were northern and working class, rather than well-spoken, they would be judged for the amount they drank.

The graduate also criticised female vicar Kate Bottley for wearing her dog collar while watching television, saying: 'You don't see the hairdressers hanging out at home with a pair of scissors'.

After tonight's Bafta success for the show, the question of what next for its stars will arise.

Scarlett said she hoped to go into politics, or to have her own TV debate show, debating such issues as 'Is Elvis really dead?'.
