A man has climbed onto the roof of an immigration detention centre in Melbourne and is holding police at bay with a threat to jump.

He is a 37-year-old Rohingyan man who has been in immigration detention for five years, according to a statement from the Refugee Action Collective.

Victoria Police said on Wednesday night they had been attempting to talk the man down since about 4.30pm.

He was on the roof of the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation detention facility at Broadmeadows.

'Police are on the scene, along with negotiators and search and rescue,' a Victoria Police spokesperson told AAP.

'He is threatening self harm and we are tying to talk him down.'

The Refugee Action Collective said the man had been in detention for around five years, as he had an adverse security assessment.

'Eleven refugees have now quietly had their adverse security assessments overturned, demonstrating what a farce the ASIO assessments are,' said Chris Breen.
