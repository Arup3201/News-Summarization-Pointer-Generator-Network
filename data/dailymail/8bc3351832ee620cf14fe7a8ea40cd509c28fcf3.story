When you are driving in bad weather or if there’s a sharp bend ahead, caution is vital.

But soon you could be able to see what is up ahead or around the corner with your own spy in the sky.

Taking a leaf from the military, Land Rover’s engineers are looking at creating miniature drones that could be launched from their new 4x4.

Land Rover engineers are looking to create miniature drones to help drivers see what is coming up on the road ahead

The drones would scan the road up to 20 yards ahead and send back live images to the driver via a mobile phone in-car wi-fi link.

The images would be displayed either on a screen in the car or on the windscreen using jet-fighter style technology.

The drones have been revealed ahead of the launch of Land Rover’s new seven-seater Discovery Sport off-roader, to be unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in October.

It is the first of a new family of Discovery vehicles that will adopt a range of innovations being developed by engineers at parent company Jaguar Land Rover.

Another development is the ‘see-through bonnet’, which would allow drivers to spot potholes or rocky terrain that would otherwise be out of sight.

Cameras in the grille would project images of the ground below onto the windscreen of the car.

Motorists could also soon be able to drive their car remotely at low speed via an iPad tablet or smartphone without being in the vehicle.

This would allow them to steer through farm gates or when coupling the vehicle to a trailer.

The car’s electrically-powered steering wheel and radar sensors would do the rest. Infra-red lasers in the fog lamps would also scan the ground ahead, produce a relief-like map of problems and engage the traction system automatically to cope with them.

Gesture control, using motion sensors, would allow drivers to command the car. With a wave of a hand or flick of a finger they could switch on the headlights, indicate or change radio channel.

A Jaguar Land Rover spokesman said: ‘Land Rover’s new, driver-assisting technology will enable safer, smarter and more enjoyable driving.’
