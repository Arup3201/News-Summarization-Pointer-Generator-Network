Jailed: Deborah Bowcock befriended Gavin Jones and plundered his accounts

A woman befriended a paralysed Gulf War veteran and fleeced him out of £250,000 so she could buy her new boyfriend a new house and car.

Cruel mother-of-two Deborah Bowcock, plundered the accounts of wheelchair-bound Gavin Jones, 45, who had been awarded a record compensation payout.

Mr Jones, a former RAF Gunner, received £2million following an unprovoked attack by three thugs which left him brain damaged and paralysed down one side of his body in 1995.

Bowcock, 40, who knew Mr Jones through her ex-husband, persuaded him to hand over power of attorney and stole £250,000 from his account.

Stoke Crown Court heard Bowcock used the cash to buy a motorbike, a car and put a deposit on a house with her partner Andrew Mellor, 35.

On Thursday she was jailed for three years while Mellor was sentenced to 18 months in prison after they both admitted theft.

Sentencing Bowcock, Judge Granville Styler told her she was guilty of a 'gross breach of trust'.

She said: 'I accept you, Deborah Bowcock, did not initially befriend the man for financial reasons, and that he also willingly lent you money, but you knew this was a gross breach of trust.

'You stole in the region of £250,000 from this man and that money was dissipated over a period of two years for your own purposes. 

'It has left him in a parlous financial situation.'

Judge Styler told Mellor: 'I accept you, Andrew Mellor, played the lesser role and had no knowledge of who Jones was.

'But you spent the money on a motor vehicle, motorbike and a large deposit on a house which has since been repossessed, and there is no money left for Mr Jones.'

The court heard how Mr Jones was on leave from the RAF at Christmas 1995 when he was attacked in a pub in Crewe, Cheshire, by three thugs who approached him and asked for a cigarette.

When he refused, one of them struck him on the back of the head.

He was knocked to the ground and although he later went to his parents’ house, his mother found him unconscious in the middle of the night and he was rushed to hospital.

He was left wheelchair-bound and in need of round-the-clock care following the attack.

In 1999 Mr Jones, who was 28 at the time of the assault, was awarded £2million - the highest amount ever paid out by the Criminal Injuries Board.

He moved into a specially-designed bungalow and relied on family and friends for support.

Bowcock met him through her ex-husband who trained with him in the RAF cadets.

She befriended Mr Jones again in 2005 and convinced him she was a financial advisor before persuading him to hand over power of attorney to her.

Between 2005 and 2007 Bowcock used her new power to transfer £332,677 to a separate bank account set up in her name.

Bowcock, from Leek, Staffordshire, told Mr Jones she was investing his cash but instead transferred £70,000 to Mellor, of County Durham.

Mellor, who knew the money came from Mr Jones, used the money to buy a new car, motorbike and a 'substantial' deposit on a house. 

She also convinced Mr Jones to lend her £60,000 to set up a tanning salon which has subsequently shut down.

Paul Spratt, prosecuting, told the court Bowcock gave £24,000 back to Mr Jones to give him the impression his investments were paying off.

But none of the money was ever invested in any financial schemes and the bank account is now empty.

He said: 'Mr Jones was left with a net figure of £1.5million after his payout but by the time he met Bowcock, he had a very substantial figure left than he originally had.

'He now has an outstanding mortgage on his property which he can’t pay off and one investment left, which has a policy of around £6,000.'

Maria Masselis, defending Bowcock, who had no previous convictions, said she was 'deeply ashamed' of her actions.

She said: 'She did not set out to steal from Mr Jones and he willingly lent her money to help start up her own business.

'She had a genuine friendship and sense of affection for Mr Jones and what she did was not premeditated.

'When she realised she could not repay the money she should have stopped and done something about it, but she continued to try and dissipate the funds, hoping it would go away.

'She is an educated woman and it begs belief why she acted so stupidly.'Anis Ali, defending Mellor, said: 'He accepts his culpability and is prepared for a custodial sentence.

'He did not know Jones but is ashamed of his conduct.'

Mr Jones has previously released a book about his ordeal called ‘Fighting Back - a Soldier Story’.
