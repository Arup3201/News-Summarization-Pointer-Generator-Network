The 81-year-old actor who was convinced he would be jailed 'on one count or another'

Coronation Street star Bill Roache has launched a bitter attack on the judge who presided over his rape trial, accusing him of ‘bias’ and ‘working for the prosecution’.

‘He mauled me,’ said the 81-year-old actor who was convinced he would be jailed ‘on one count or another’ of the two rapes and four indecent assault charges he faced during his 17-day court case.

And, extraordinarily, even at the very moment his friends and supporters celebrated his acquittal, Roache believed he was ‘going down’ – as he misheard the jury foreman’s verdict as ‘guilty’ due to a chronic hearing problem.

It was only when his burly minder clapped his hands and shouted: ‘Get that man out of the dock!’ did he realise he was a free man.

Roache revealed: ‘I didn’t hear the verdict properly, I didn’t hear a couple of “nots”.  I thought I had gone on two [charges] – I just heard guilty, guilty. I really thought they had got me.’

The actor condemned Mr Justice Holroyde for being biased – an accusation supported by his barrister, Louise Blackwell QC, who unusually made two applications to have the jury discharged due to the ‘unfairly biased nature’ of the judge’s summing up.

‘In my view the judge wasn’t impartial. The judge was biased, he mauled me. I thought that was it,’ the star said.

‘My QC was absolutely brilliant. She challenged the judge over his summing up, it was so ridiculous.

‘The judge sent the jury out and my barrister said, “Your summing up is biased”. It was unprecedented.

‘He brought the jury in and I thought he was very different. But in the end, I thought he was still biased. The judge just didn’t like me.

‘Judges, they work for the prosecution, in my opinion. I didn’t realise this.’

His comments were made at a meeting of the Circle Of Love, a spiritualist group of which he has been a member for a number of years. He is pictured attending this meeting with his daughter Verity to the left

Asked about his costs, a jubilant Roache said: ‘I’ll get everything back. When you win, you get everything back.’

His comments were made at a meeting of the Circle Of Love, a spiritualist group of which he has been a member for a number of years. The Mail on Sunday was allowed exclusive access to the group’s meeting in Ashton-under-Lyne near Manchester just hours after the court case ended on Thursday.

Relieved but exhausted, the father of four mingled with the congregation and spoke candidly of his ordeal as supporters came up to hug and congratulate him.

He told them: ‘I was resigned to going down on one charge  or another. It’s not about truth, or about justice, it’s a game.’ He explained how chronic tinnitus caused him to mistake the jury foreman’s fateful words.

‘My family were weeping and it wasn’t until my security man started clapping and the judge said, “You may leave the dock” that I realised I was a free man. The jury got it right.’

Asked about when he would return to Coronation Street, Roache said he would be back in August. He said: ‘I’m going in to have a meeting with Granada next week. They’ve said the storylines are written until July. They just can’t fit me in until August because the scripts are so far in advance.’

Asked about whether he would be taking a break, Roache replied: ‘I may pop away for a few days at a spa. I’m taking one day at a time. We’re all right now.’

The actor arrived at the meeting  in a black Range Rover accompanied by his daughter Verity, 31, and her boyfriend. He hugged and kissed members as he stepped into the Seraphina Holistic Centre at Ashton-under-Lyne for the two- hour meeting.

At the start of the candlelit session, a woman strummed a guitar and sang about love, then the group’s 28-year-old leader James Wood  delivered a rambling sermon on love and world peace, before the group held hands and meditated.

Roache closed his eyes and bowed his head. As he meditated, one of the speakers encouraged the group to ‘bring love into the room’.

It was during a break with tea, coffee and biscuits that Roache delivered his blistering attack on the trial judge.

The soap star, who was suspended from Coronation Street while on remand, spent much of the two hours talking intensely to founder member Ann Rogers, who earlier had talked about establishing ‘peace and love on this earth’ so subsequent generations would ‘never know fear’.

Roache, the world’s longest-serving soap actor, having played Ken Barlow in Coronation Street since its launch in 1960, had name-checked group leader Mr Wood on the steps of the court after the verdict.

He said: ‘I would like to thank James and the Circle Of Love for their love and energy that has brought me to this place and this time, and I look forward to being with them this Friday night.’

The pair shared an emotional reunion at the meeting, as they embraced and James offered words of support to the actor.

Mr Wood became a member of the Circle Of Love three years ago, after being introduced to Ann Rogers through a mutual friend. Since  then he has become a close confidant of  Roache.

Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Mr Wood, of Appleton, near Warrington, Cheshire, said: ‘Bill is a dear friend and I am pleased that  he has drawn support from the  Circle Of Love.

‘I know we’ve been painted in the press as a weird cult, but people find our message difficult to understand, because it’s so simple.’

Mr Wood explained that the ethos of the cult was to ‘bring peace to the earth through encouraging people to love each other’.

Roache was first drawn to spiritualism in the late 1960s when he joined a druid movement, explaining years later that his beliefs helped him cope with the tragic death in 1984 of his 18-month-old daughter Edwina.

Two years ago he joined the Circle Of Love, saying he wanted a ‘more spiritual path’.

He has attended regular group meetings, even during his time  on remand.

Towards the end of the trial, Ms Blackwell drew up a list of 30 points which she said should not have been put before the jury in the summing up, and made an application that the trial should be scrapped.

After consideration, Mr Justice Holroyde said: ‘I don’t accept the submission that the content or tone of my summary of the evidence thus far could give rise to any inference of leaning towards the prosecution or against the defence.’
