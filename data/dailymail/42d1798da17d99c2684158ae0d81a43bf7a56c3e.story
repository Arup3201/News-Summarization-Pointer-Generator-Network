This November, mother-of-two Emma Styles and her husband, Paul, are planning a weekend away in Paris to celebrate 30 years of marriage.

While for some British couples this would mean a romantic stroll along the Seine and a candle lit dinner for two, for Emma 49, and Paul, 50, it will involve a visit to a Parisian swingers club where anything goes.

The couple, from Kew, London, have frequented such sexually liberated establishments for years - and Emma said it has done wonders for their marriage.

Open relationship: Emma and her husband Paul enjoy swinging in Paris

She told the MailOnline of their sexcapades: 'Our
 marriage has been enhanced greatly by fully enjoying our weekends away.

'In the early days it was a great talking point between us - especially in 
the bedroom, where without embarrassment or fear of what either would 
think - we could relive moments we'd enjoyed or moments we'd like to enjoy
 in the future.

Mutual understanding: The couple have been married for nearly 30 years and don't get jealous seeing their partner with someone else

'I suppose we looked upon it as a kind of hobby, people 
would go on gastronomic weekends, cultural weekends (we did many of 
those also) we just went on slightly more gratifying weekends.'

While Emma said she and her husband always had a happy sex life, it was after a weekend to Paris when she was 29 and they had been married for seven years that they truly had a sexual awakening - after dabbling in sex shows and venues famed for swinging.

Since then she has had numerous sexual encounters with married men, women, a distinguished French diplomat and - what she rates among her favourite experiences - a team of French firefighters.

As previously reported in the MailOnline, Emma has written about their sexual liberation in a self-published erotic memoir called First Tango In Paris.

The book has been climbing up the best-sellers lists on Amazon and Emma has been approached by publishers seeking to produce a hardback version.

Tell all: Emma said her sexual awakening began when she was 29 and she had since written a memoir of her sexcapades

She is also working on a sequel that will bring readers up-to-date with the couples more recent experiences.

When it comes to her dalliances with other men - and her husband's with other women - Emma said there has never been any jealously or arguments.

She said they went into situations with 'their eyes wide open' and always with one another's consent.

She explained that at first they established ground rules of 'look but don't touch' but these quickly went out the window when they realised how much seeing their partner with someone else turned them on.

Emma writes in her book how this unfolded for the first time when they were approached by another couple in a French club.Â 

She writes: 'The atmosphere was electric... and soon a very attractive couple came and stood beside us, very quickly it became apparent that they fancied having some fun with us, right there and then.

Frisson: Emma said she and her husband enjoy knowing other people are attracted to them (posed by models)

'She started to run her hand up and down my thigh and whispered something in my ear, I looked at Paul and he whispered "what about our ground rules?" I grinned and said "I'm about to break them... just a tiny bit?" A look of pure ecstasy instantly crossed his face, and in a blur I found myself being gently kissed by her partner.' Emma explained to the MailOnline that 'jealousy was never an issue' between her and Paul, with whom she two grown up children.

She said: 'I feel this is because we had married so young and had grown up and grown into the marriage together and there was never really a his and hers agenda, we simply did things together as one unit.'

Speaking of that first encounter that led to many more, she said: 'I enjoyed seeing other attractive women sexually attracted to Paul, safe in the knowledge that he was mine.

'It was a boost to both our ego's that after seven years of marriage, we were both still attracted to and desired by others. In the elegant club environment of Paris, it was the perfect situation to let go of any inhibitions and to act out your wildest fantasies and fulfill any desires you might wish at the time. It was all available and possible.'

Explicit: The writer said her book is an honest account of her experiences

Emma said that her double life over the years - juggling being a mother at home and a swinger in Paris - has added frisson to her sexual encounters and marriage.

She said: 'The fact it's on foreign soil gave us a sense of bravado as the chance of bumping into anyone you may have had an inappropriate moment with on the Monday morning back in Waitrose was minute to say the least.

'Also we adore the elegance in which the Parisians do things, it's all had a little 'je ne sais quoi'. They seem to have a different attitude to Britain.'

Emma admits her book is not 'for the faint-hearted' but she insists every word is true and while some readers may not condone her behaviour, she hopes others may find it inspiring.

She said: 'I don't in any way class 
my book as pornography but pure and simple factual erotica written for 
today's modern woman by a woman who is real and has lived it.

'I hope it inspires women from wherever and whatever age you are, to 
embrace your sexuality, and explore fully the deep dark erotic side that
we all have (some hidden deeper than others).'
