Authorities say an 9-year-old autistic girl last seen running naked from her familyâ€™s vacation home in Northern California has been missing now for three days with few new clues into her whereabouts.

Mikaela Lynch, who has the mental capacity of a 1-year-old, has been missing in Clearlake since Sunday afternoon after her parents say she was left alone and outside for an 'unknown period of time.'

Her family tells police that Mikaela was playing with her younger brother on a trampoline outside their home around 1pm when she abruptly took off while leaving her clothes and shoes behind.

Missing: Mikaela Lynch, 9, who has the mental capacity of a 1-year-old, has been missing in Northern California since Sunday after her family says she ran from their home naked while playing outside

'She was an in enclosed yard, there was some sort of distraction, I believe a bee in the yard, the younger brother opened the gate, went inside, and when they came back, the daughter was missing,' Clearlake Police Lt. Tim Celli told ABC.

Mikaela, originally from San Francisco, is described as 'severely autistic.' She is non-verbal and doesn't respond to being called.

Police were told she often removed her clothes when she was hot. The articles, including her shoes, were found in her family's yard.

A diaper the girl was believed to have been wearing was also located near a waterway by canines at least one house away, Celli told the Santa Rosa Democrat, prompting additional fears of drowning.

On Monday a neighbor's nearby video surveillance instead caught the girl running up the street and away from the waterway, turning the investigation away from the water - an area initially searched by divers.

Vanished: Mikaela's family say she was playing in this vacation home's enclosed backyard when she abruptly took off through an open gate left by her younger brother

Search: Authorities originally feared the girl had run off toward the water surrounding their home, seen circled in red, but thanks to a neighbor's surveillance video believe she ran from it

Authorities say the girl's mother, Bari Lynch, who left in search of her daughter in her truck, unknowingly trailed her daughter's path down the same road only minutes later, but without success.

Authorities say they do not believe she was abducted.

Residents are being asked to look high and low for the girl with her whereabouts believed to be anywhere.

'She's very inquisitive and she likes to explore, climb,' Haben Porter, a teacher at Sunset Elementary School who worked with Mikaela told ABC.

Mikaela is described as 4'0" tall, weighing 70 lbs, with blue eyes and brown hair.

Because of Mikaela's mental state, age and circumstances of her missing, she is believed to be At Risk.

Anyone with information on her whereabouts is asked to contact the Clearlake Police Department at 707-994-8251
