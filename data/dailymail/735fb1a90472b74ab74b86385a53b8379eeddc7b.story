Lamde duck: The Global Times has published an editorial deriding Obama days before a visit to China

A mouthpiece of the Chinese Government has described President Obama as 'insipid' and claims U.S. voters are sick of his 'banality'.

The state-run Global Times has published an editorial deriding the leader a few days ahead of his visit to the growing economic and military powerhouse.

It stated: 'Obama always utters "Yes, we can," which led to the high expectations people had for him. But he has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters.

'U.S. society has grown tired of his banality.'

The criticism comes in the wake of a crushing defeat in the Midterm elections worse even than the most pessimistic forecasts of the Democrats' strategists, with the Republicans now in control of both the upper and lower Houses of Congress.

The Global Times lists the 'lame-duck' president's perceived failures in foreign policy and the economy.

It said Obama took: 'U.S. troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, but left no peace.

'Osama bin Laden was killed during his tenure, but (ISIS) has emerged from the Middle East.'

Despite an improvement in the American economy, the editorial criticises his inability to lower the income gap, claiming ordinary Americans have not benefited from the recovery.

However, the piece does admit that Obama faced many problems when he took the reins of power, inheriting a moribund economy and 'the decline of U.S. influence'.

It also takes aim at the political system in America, claiming it is 'too lazy to reform'.

Cheers Barack: Chinese President Xi Jinping, who ranks just after Obama in Forbes' most recent list of the 72 most power people in the world, will host the U.S. president when he visits China next week

Obama will focus on the global economy and U.S. policy toward the Asia-Pacific region during stops next week in China, Myanmar and Australia.

The itinerary includes a state visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. While in China, Obama will attend the APEC Leaders Meeting and the APEC chief executive Summit.

In Forbes recent list of the 72 most powerful people in the world, Obama came second to Russian president Vladimir Putin, closely followed by People's Republic of China leader Xi Jinping.
