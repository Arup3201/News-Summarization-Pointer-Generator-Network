A Dallas nurse who recovered from Ebola will soon be reunited with her dog, which has been sequestered since his owner became ill.

The King Charles Cavalier spaniel named Bentley is in quarantine at an abandoned Navy base in Dallas.

His owner, Nina Pham, was diagnosed with Ebola earlier this month. She contracted the virus while caring for a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died October 8.

Where's Nina? Pham has not been allowed to visit with her dog yet, since it could cause Bentley to become anxious. Pictured again on Thursday

Looking forward to a happy reunion: Pham contracted the disease after volunteering to treat U.S. Ebola patient-zero Thomas Eric Duncan. She has since recovered from the deadly disease. Pictured above giving a hug to President Barach Obama on October 24

City spokeswoman Sana Syed said Thursday that the dog has tested negative for Ebola and that his 21-day quarantine — the Ebola incubation period — ends Saturday.

Pham was released from her own quarantine on October 24.

Syed says Pham won't visit the dog sooner because he may become anxious if he sees her but is then left behind in isolation.

Pham was one of two nurses to contract Ebola after treating Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. 

Nurse Amber Vinson has also been cured of the deadly disease which has currently claimed nearly 5,000 lives, mainly in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. 

That leaves only one person currently being treated for Ebola in the U.S. Dr Craig Spencer of New York is currently being treated for the disease in an isolation wing at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital. 

He came down the disease less than a week after returning from West Africa where he was performing aid work with Doctors Without Borders. 

Ms Pham was the first Ebola patient in the U.S. to have been in contact with a pet as she came down with the virus. While dogs are not known to be the virus' natural carriers, it's still unclear whether they indeed spread it to humans if they've come into contact with someone who is infected. 

In Spain, those questions caused officials to put down the dog of nurse there who became infected.  

Nurse's best friend: Pham's beloved dog has been in quarantine since just after she admitted herself to the hospital with a high temperature 

Under observation: Workers in hazmat suits removed Bentley from Pham's home, and took him to a special isolation room at a nearby naval base. He has been treated by veterinarians and other workers every day. On Thursday he tested negative for Ebola for a third time
