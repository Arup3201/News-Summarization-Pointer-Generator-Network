It was a scene of horror that has scarred their minds for decades.

But now, in their nineties, seven US prisoners of war have returned to Omori, where they were starved and forced into manual labor for four grueling years.

The Japanese camp, which was built on a superficial island between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1941, is now a boat racing venue surrounded by office buildings.

Today, however, it played host to a small group of men who know the true horrors that took place in that spot.

Bill Sanchez, 96, was one of thousands of men put to work unloading cargo for hours.

They would work through the night with just a small bowl of rice for food.

But in those hungry times, they also were among the luckiest, he claims.

'[It] was great work because we had a lot of opportunities to pinch food. We learned real quick,' said Sanchez, of Monterey Park, California, who watched as American fire bombs incinerated nearby neighborhoods.  

Sanchez joined six of his comrades invited to visit the camp - now known as Peace Island - by the Japanese government. 

Amazed, he told Tokyo's Temple University how much the country has changed: 'All this land you see was reclaimed by us, the American prisoners of the war and the British prisoners of the war,' Sanchez said. 

'And I am amazed at how well they have used the land.'

Changed: Sanchez can still remember feeling so hungry he would steal food while unloading cargo

Every single one of the prisoners could still vividly remember their hunger almost 70 years ago.

'In four years, I never had a good meal', said Jack Schwartz, 99, of Hanford, California.

Schwartz was a civil engineering graduate of the California Institute of Technology when he enlisted in the Navy Civil Engineer Corps in 1940. 

Taken prisoner in Guam, he spent much of his imprisonment at the Zentsuji Camp, a 'showcase' camp on western Japan's Shikoku island. 

'I arrived two days ago and had my first good meal ever in Japan.'

Like the other former POWs, Schwartz marveled at Tokyo's progress since Japan's surrender in August 1945, especially high-tech toilets equipped to warm, wash and dry.

'I sat down on a toilet seat and it was warm!'

Oral C. Nichols, 93, of Carlsbad, New Mexico, was working in construction on Wake Island in the Pacific when the Japanese took the island in 1941, capturing 5,000 prisoners. By the time the war ended, he had been moved to Shanghai and then to an open pit iron mine in northern Japan.

'But also I was young and had set myself a goal to live, that I was going to live regardless,' Nichols said.

During the war, the Japanese held over 30,000 allied force members as prisoners in dozens of camps in Japan, China and elsewhere in Asia, according to the POW Research Network Japan.

The former POWs said they understood that the cruelty and brutality they experienced during the war had much to do with the times.

One of 91-year-old Darrel Stark's most vivid memories is of a supervisor in the prison camp at Yokkaichi, a copper smelting center in western Japan, who did not retaliate when Stark and another prisoner stole his lunch.

'He came the next day with two lunches, 'One for you, and one for me,'' said Stark, of Stafford Springs, Connecticut. 'If he had reported me, I wouldn't have been speaking to you tonight.'
