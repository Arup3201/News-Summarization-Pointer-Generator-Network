Despite being just five years old - Hannah Higgins has displayed more bravery in the face of adversity than most adults will in a lifetime.

The young girl, who had cancer, sent a deeply moving message to other sick children - telling them: 'If you have cancer don't worry - I am brave and you can be brave also.'

With the help of her father Joshua, the amazing young girl recorded a video talking people through her illness and the ordeal she has been through.

Moving: Five-year-old Hannah Higgins sends a reassuring message to other children suffering from cancer

But instead of appearing downcast in the two-minute Youtube clip, Hannah talks about her tumours, her treatment and the effect they have had on her with an astounding level of maturity.

She was diagnosed with bilateral Wilms' tumor, a form of kidney cancer, in February 2014 and treated at Rady Childrens Hospital in San Diego. 

She then underwent six months of chemotherapy, had radiation treatment to her lungs and has had four bouts of surgery to remove her left kidney and part of her right kidney. 

In the video she describes the tumour that was removed as a 'big meatball on her kidney'.

She adds: 'Chemo has medicine to kill the cells that are growing the tumour and the medicine keeps going to try and kill it. 

'This also damages the cells which grow my hair so all my hair fell out. 

'I had something called radiation also, which is pretty fun because you get to blow bubbles and I can bring my CD and sing along.

'And you have these butterfly stickers they draw on you with permanent marker.

'Cancer is no fun but its a little bit fun because you get to go on this camp.'  

Towards the end of the heartrending clip she explains that she is making the video to help others deal with cancer.  

She says: 'I want to be on TV and I want to be on the newspaper so people can see how brave I've been during cancer.

'If you have cancer don't worry - I am brave and you can be brave also.'

Hannah finished her treatment on August 25 and has been told that there are no more signs of the disease.

Her mother Kristen said: 'Hannah is doing well, she finished her treatment and her end of treatment scans showed no evidence of disease. 

'She will be regularly monitored by MRI and CT for the next five years. She started kindergarten this fall and is doing great!' 

Below the YouTube post, her father Joshua wrote: 'Throughout her ordeal, she has always been very matter a fact about the entire situation. 

'She understands what's going on and knows what's needed to fix it. 

'She approached us one day and said she wanted to do a "commercial" to explain to other kids what they can expect when going through cancer and show them "how brave" she has been. #teamhannah'

The YouTube video has already been viewed by thousands of people with many praising Hannah for her bravery on Twitter.

One user, Lorena Loana, tweeted: 'So much bravery and hope in a little soul! Really motivating and emotional.'

Another wrote: 'This adorable five-year-old wanted to make her own commercial. So she did. She's brave and I love her.'

Joshua is encouraging those moved by Hannah's message to donate to either Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation or St. Baldrick's Foundation.

Both charities focus on research - an area in children's cancer fundraising that is sometimes under-funded.
