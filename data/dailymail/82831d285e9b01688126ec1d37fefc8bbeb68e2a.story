This talented Great Dane really does know how to be happy! 

The musically-inclined mutt from Portland, Oregon, can teach Grumpy Cat a thing or two about being cheery.

Abbey Doo may look like she can't be bothered but she's paying close attention to what's going on. 

And when her owner sings the childhood classic If You're Happy And You Know It… Abbey Doo wags her tail right on cue, thumping it resoundingly on the floor.

The dog's interpretation of the song is adorable and she's got a perfect sense of timing as she doesn't miss a beat. 

Instead of simply clapping her paws or nodding her head, this talented hound slaps her tail with unbridled enthusiasm.

Waiting for her cue: The hound's impeccable sense of rhythm is clearly evident in the video

Time to wag that tail! Abbey Doo's 'mummy' Madi McGlone from Portland, uploaded the video on YouTube

The heart-warming video was uploaded on YouTube by Abbey Doo's 'mummy' Madi McGlone whose voice can be heard singing the song.

According to Miss McGlone's Twitter feed, she was singing the song with her mother when the dog joined in. 

The video currently has over 50,000 views on YouTube and Abbey Doo has gained new fans and garnered and positive reviews

User Vreeda Anna said: 'Awwww madam, this is so lovely! Thank you for sharing with us.'

Fan Dorie Bertram enjoyed the video as well, saying:  'This gave me a much needed LOL for the day!'
