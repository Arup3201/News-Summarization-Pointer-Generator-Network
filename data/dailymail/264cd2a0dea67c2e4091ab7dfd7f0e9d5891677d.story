Greg Halford's proposed loan move to Bolton Wanderers from Nottingham Forest is off after the defender suffered an injury in training.  

Forest boss Stuart Pearce had decided the 29-year-old former Sunderland and Wolves right-back is surplus to requirements at The City Ground with Jack Hunt, Eric Lichaj, Danny Fox and Dan Harding all ahead of him in the pecking order.

And Bolton boss Dougie Freedman thought he had taken advantage to snap Halford up with David Wheater, Liam Trotter and Kevin McNaughton among a lengthy Wanderers injury list.

Bolton, who also signed Crystal Palace midfielder Owen Garvan on loan on Wednesday, could revisit the deal when Halford returns from injury.
