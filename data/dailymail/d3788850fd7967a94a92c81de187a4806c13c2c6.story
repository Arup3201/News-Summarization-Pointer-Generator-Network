And Cerezo has revealed Atletico Madrid would be among Torres' potential suitors if he was to leave Milan.

Cerezo, speaking to TVE, said: 'The signing of Torres is not (completed), but, that does not mean it will not be.

'We have a great team, but we can bring in a signing until the last hour of the transfer market.

'We will fight for La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa del Rey in 2015.'

Torres has scored just one goal in 10 league games since joining Milan.
