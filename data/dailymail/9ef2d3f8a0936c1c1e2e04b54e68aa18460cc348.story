Lewis Hamilton secured the 40th pole of his grand prix career at a rain-hit Sepang on Saturday but the question afterwards was whether Nico Rosberg had attempted to block him in qualifying.

And both men were asking it. 

At the Mercedes press conference, Rosberg put his hand up.

Rosberg has been accused of attempting to block Hamilton during qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix

'Nico Rosberg, Mercedes AMG Petronas,' he started, imitating a journalist. 'There are a lot of comments on Twitter saying Nico blocked you. Is it true he blocked you on your second timed lap?'

Hamilton replied, smiling: 'I think you should probably ask him. I think he'll have a good opinion on that.'

The room laughed, but Rosberg appeared to be annoyed. He shook his head and twice said: 'That's not funny.'

Rosberg, going slowly, appeared to stay on the racing line as Hamilton was on a flying lap in the final qualifying session.

But it made no difference because, as it transpired, Hamilton already had pole position sewn up. Rosberg was third fastest.

The German was then asked by a reporter if he did indeed intentionally block Hamilton.

'You best ask Lewis about that, he said. 'No, it is not even a relevant discussion because we were both on slow-down laps at that point in time. And that was very, very clear.'

Informed Hamilton had set a personal best in the first sector, Rosberg said: 'Yeah, but if you bail out of a lap it turns into a slow-down lap, doesn't it?'

It was then suggested to Rosberg that Hamilton only slowed as he came upon the German, to which he said: 'That is not true. He backed off way before coming up on me.'

Although the next question was on a different subject, Rosberg chose not to let the matter drop and remarked: 'How do we make that a fact, that he bailed out before he came across me?

'That is the interesting one because me just saying it isn't going to bear much weight. So, we need to think of one, which I don't have an answer for to make that a fact for you. I will have to think about something later on. Or you can ask Toto (Wolff, Mercedes motorsport boss) who is coming. That is maybe a good one. That will give some more weight to it.'

Unfortunately for Rosberg, Wolff was unavailable for his session, and so could not offer an opinion.

It is not the first time Rosberg has been accused of blocking Hamilton in qualifying. 

At last year's Monaco Grand Prix, Rosberg appeared to scupper his team-mate's best shot at pole by deliberately running off the circuit. Yellow flags were subsequently deployed, and Hamilton, running behind his rival on the track, was forced to slow down.
