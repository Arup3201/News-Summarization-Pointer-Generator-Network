'She is 88,' he said. 'She is a national treasure.'

Mrs Bush and her husband, 41st President George H.W. Bush, are the longest-married first couple and are set to celebrate their 69th wedding anniversary on January 6.

President Barack Obama and former-President Bill Clinton sent warm wishes to Mrs Bush and her husband thanked the two with a tweet issued through his spokesman.

Mrs Bush has been having more health problems in recent years.

In November 2008 she underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer.

A year later, she had heart surgery to correct a severe narrowing of the main heart valve and in 2010 she had a milk relapse of Graves disease.

Her husband has had deteriorating health as well.

The 89-year-old spend nearly two months at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchities-related cough. He was released in January 2013 but has been unable to attend many events since then.Â
