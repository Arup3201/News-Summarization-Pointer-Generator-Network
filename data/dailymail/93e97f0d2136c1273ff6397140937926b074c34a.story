The Internal Revenue Service has 
lost emails from five more employees who are part of congressional 
probes into the treatment of conservative groups that applied for 
tax-exempt status, the tax service disclosed on Friday.

The IRS said 
in June that it could not locate an untold number of emails to and from 
Lois Lerner, who headed the IRS division that processes applications for
 tax-exempt status during the time that the targeting of Tea Party groups occurred.

That revelation set off a new round of investigations
 and congressional hearings.

On
 Friday, the IRS issued a report to Congress saying the agency also lost
 emails from five other employees related to the probe, including two 
agents who worked in a Cincinnati office processing applications for 
tax-exempt status.

The 
disclosure came on the same day the Senate's subcommittee on 
investigations released competing reports on how the IRS handled 
applications from political groups during the 2010 and 2012 elections.

The
 Democratic report, released by Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, said both 
liberal and conservative groups were mistreated, revealing no political 
bias by the IRS.

The Republican report, issued by Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona, said conservative groups were clearly treated worse.

The
 IRS inspector general set off a firestorm last year with an audit that 
said IRS agents singled out tea party and other conservative groups for 
inappropriate scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.

Lerner's
 lost emails prompted a new round of scrutiny by Congress, the Justice 
Department, the inspector general and at least two federal judges.

The
 IRS blamed computer crashes for all the lost emails.

In a statement, 
the IRS said all the crashes happened well before Congress launched its 
investigations.

The IRS first told Congress in June that other 
employees involved in the probe also had computer problems.

At the time,
 IRS Commissioner John Koskinen promised lawmakers a report on whether 
any had lost emails.

The report was issued Friday.

'Throughout
 this review, the IRS has found no evidence that any IRS personnel 
deliberately destroyed any evidence,' the IRS statement said.

'To the 
contrary, the computer issues identified appear to be the same sorts of 
issues routinely experienced by employees within the IRS, in other 
government agencies and in the private sector.'

When
 Congress started investigating the IRS last year, the agency identified
 82 employees who might have documents related to the inquiries.

The IRS
 said 18 of those people had computer problems between September 2009 
and February 2014. Of those employees, five probably lost emails — in 
addition to Lerner — the agency said Friday.

Lerner,
 who was placed on leave and later retired, has emerged as a central
 figure in congressional investigations. The other five employees appear
 to be more junior than she.

In
 addition to the Cincinnati workers, they include a technical adviser to
 Lerner, a tax law specialist and a group manager in the tax-exempt 
division.

In general, the IRS
 said the workers archived emails on their computer hard drives when 
their email accounts became too full. When those computers crashed, their 
emails were lost.

'By all 
accounts, in each instance the user contacted IT staff and attempted to 
recover his or her data,' the IRS statement said.

The
 IRS has said it stored emails on backup tapes but those tapes were 
re-used every six months. The inspector general's office is reviewing 
those tapes to see if any old emails can be retrieved.

'The
 IRS has lost thousands of emails, but worse yet, completely lost the 
American people's trust,' said Sarah Swinehart, a spokeswoman for House 
Ways and Means Republicans.

'The DOJ must appoint a special prosecutor 
so the full truth can come out.'

Attorney General Eric Holder has 
turned down numerous requests from congressional Republicans for a 
special prosecutor, citing numerous investigations already underway.

After investigating the IRS for more than a year, the two senators said today that they disagree on whether the tax agency treated conservative groups worse than their liberal counterparts when they applied for tax-exempt status

Friday's
 reports by the Senate subcommittee on investigations mark the 
conclusion of just one investigation. The Justice Department and three 
other congressional committees are continuing their probes.

Levin
 is chairman of the investigations subcommittee and McCain is the 
ranking Republican. Their staffs routinely work together on 
investigations, and while they don't always agree on the results, it is 
highly unusual for them to issue such diverging reports.

The
 investigation found that the IRS used inappropriate selection criteria,
 burdensome questions and lengthy delays in processing applications for 
501(c)(4) tax exempt status from both conservative and liberal groups,' 
Levin said in a statement.

The
 Democratic report slams last year's audit by the IRS inspector general.
 It says the IG report was incomplete because it focused only on the 
treatment of conservative groups.

The IG's report 'produced distorted 
audit results that continue to be misinterpreted,' the Democratic report
 said.

J. Russell George, the
 Treasury inspector general for tax administration, said his 
investigation is ongoing, with facts 'still coming to light.'

'I
 firmly stand behind the audit report that we issued last year, showing 
the inappropriate treatment of applicants for 501 (c)(4) status, for 
which the IRS apologized,' George said in a statement.

'It is important 
to remember that the IRS accepted all of the recommendations contained 
in our audit report.'

McCain's report says far more conservative groups were singled out 
for extra scrutiny. They were also asked more questions and were more 
likely to have their applications rejected or withdrawn.

'The
 IRS selected conservative groups out of normal processing, placed them 
on a separate list, stopped work on their applications completely, 
forced them to answer intrusive questions about their behavior and 
demeanor at meetings and delayed their applications for multiple years,'
 the Republican report said.

'Our investigation has uncovered no 
evidence that liberal groups received the same expansive inappropriate 
treatment that conservative groups received.'

The
 Democratic report said investigators reviewed 800,000 pages of 
documents and conducted 22 interviews with current and former workers at
 the IRS and the inspector general's office.

The investigators were not allowed to see confidential taxpayer information, so many of 
the documents were blacked out, however.

Only
 two committees in Congress have the authority to see confidential 
taxpayer information: the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate 
Finance Committee. Those two committees are continuing their probes.
