Two teachers from the same Georgia school have been charged with sex offences against children.

Former teacher of the year Debra Tanksley, 37, has been accused of sending sexually explicit photos and thousands of inappropriate texts to one of her students.

A week earlier her 24-year-old colleague Ashley Ashe appeared in court on charges that she had oral sex with a student.

Police in Burke County, Georgia, said they hoped the arrest of the two women would not 'open a Pandora's Box' into allegations of inappropriate behavior.

Tanksley and Ashe both worked at Burke County High School.

Ashe was first to be arrested after she was accused of having a sexual relationship with a student.

The married teacher is alleged to have confessed to having oral sex with the 16-year-old boy. She is also said to have admitted kissing the teen off campus.

During a court appearance on May 9th she claimed her confession was made under duress and asked for it to be withdrawn.

Ashe was charged with aggravated child molestation charges.

During the investigation police learned about Tanksley's alleged relationship with a teen student.

Tanksley is alleged to have become involved with the student earlier this year.

Burke County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt Dedric Smith said they had recovered a large number of text messages.

'The text messages were very detailed as to what they wanted to do,' said Smith.

Smith refused to go into detail of what the pictures were other than to say they were of a sexual nature.

He also said during the course of the relationship she offered to fix the grades for the student.

'The text messages detailed what the student needed for GPA average and she went in and changed the grades in that particular class to get that student up to what the student wanted,' Smith said.

Smith admitted having two teachers from the same school on sex charges was a concern.

'We hope it's isolated incident not something that's going to open up Pandora's Box with other stuff coming forward,' Smith said.

Investigators started questioning Tanksley's relationships with students after looking into Ashe's past with another student, Smith said.

Tanksley was Teacher of the Year for 2012-2013, the school system confirmed.

The Burke County School System said Tanksley is placed on administrative leave.
