Unimpressed: Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal

This was a bridge too far for a cash-strapped Indian government. In an apparent bid to bridge the fiscal deficit, it was banking on raising over Rs 40,000 crore from the 2G spectrum auction.

But the plan failed abysmally as telecom companies - bristling with anger over an exorbitantly high reserve price of Rs 13,850 crore for all 22 circles set at the auction - decided to stay away.

What the government got was a mere Rs 9,407 crore. Worse, the lucrative Delhi and Mumbai circles went begging and found no takers. Karnataka and Rajasthan had no bidders either. In fact, none bid for an all-India licence.

The end result was that the ambitious plans to curtail the ballooning budget deficit had come a cropper and the government had only itself to blame.

The telecom industry drew a clear link between the reserve price and the poor response.

"First and foremost among the many causes, is the recognition that an artificially-high reserve price that bore no congruence to market realities was the key reason for the failure," said Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI)'s director general Rajan Mathews.

Telecom minister Kapil Sibal appeared to have read the reason for the 2G auction fizzle. He said the government may put the circles on auction again and possibly rework the auction reserve prices.

"We would like to auction unsold spectrum by March next year. The government will take a call on lowering auction the price of Delhi and Mumbai," Sibal said on Wednesday.

A top official said the department of telecommunications (DoT) would ask Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to look into the reserve price for the pan-India 2G licence. For the record, this is almost seven times more than what telcos paid in the 2008 when then telecom minister A. Raja gave them start-up spectrum of 4.4 MHz at Rs 1,651 crore.

The government was looking crestfallen and defeated and industry was determined to blame it for the poor show.

"The results of the auction clearly indicate that the reserve price was completely off the mark, with none of the interested operators not pitching in for the circles that they had committed to participate in," said Prashant Singhal, a partner in Ernst & Young Global.

The auction was held after the Supreme Court in February this year cancelled 122 licences held by eight telecom operators. It ended after 15 rounds on the second day of bidding.

Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Norway's Telenor and Videocon bid for GSM airwaves, but there were no bidders for the CDMA spectrum after Tata Teleservices and Videocon pulled out of the race.

New players and telecom companies affected by the Supreme Court verdict had to win at least four blocks to start or continue their operations. While telcos in India had an eye on their balance sheet as they bid at the auction, the government made little effort in doing roadshows abroad to lure foreign players.

Telcos highlighted several deterrents that led to the poor bids. COAI's Rajan Mathews said the majority of bidders were operators who had lost their licences and were compelled to participate in the auctions despite the high prices and the limited availability in order to sustain their customers, businesses and to protect their investments.

This apart, the limiting of spectrum available for auction, which contrary to the Supreme Court ruling to auction the entire spectrum related to the quashing of the 2G licences, added to the sense of uncertainty among potential bidders.

The artificial scarcity created by holding back spectrum combined with the high reserve price dampened any enthusiasm for aggressive bidding by the operators.

"The auctions have concluded on the exact note as predicted," said Mathews. The only circle that did well in the bids was Bihar, where the provisional winning price increased by Rs 1.7 crore over the reserve price.

Apart from Bihar, demand was largely concentrated in Uttar Pradesh (East), Uttar Pradesh (West) and Gujarat. Meanwhile, Vodafone India, which won airwaves in six zones, said it had always maintained that auctions were the best and the only transparent method for allocation of spectrum.

"Our decision to participate in the 2G auction was to secure additional spectrum in many circles where we have not received any new 2G spectrum since 2008," the company said in a statement.

However, it said that the entire spectrum that is currently unused should be put on auction at the same time with a much lower reserve price.

"The government should follow TRAI's advice to abandon staggered spectrum usage fees which are higher for operators who require more spectrum. This does not make sense if spectrum is bought in an auction and is paid for already. Spectrum usage fees should be flat and only represent the charge for administering the spectrum. TRAI has advised to put this at 1% of revenues," the Videocon statement said.

On January 10, 2008, A. Raja with great alacrity and aplomb subverted the
system to allocate out of turn spectrum to a handful of beneficiaries 
at 2001 prices without indexing for inflation.

He did this despite 
repeated advice given by different sections in the government to use a 
market determined auction process.

On February 2, 2012, the Supreme 
Court struck down the award of these licences in a landmark decision 
clearly establishing malafide.

The average revenue per user in 2008 for 
telcos was hovering around Rs 300. Cut to November, 2012 when ARPUS have 
dropped to sub Rs 100 (Rs 97). By setting an unimaginably high reserve price
of Rs 14,000 crore for all India spectrum (22 circles), a greedy 
government grossly miscalculated and ended up with egg on its face.

This
was the biggest deterrent for local telcos already staring at a 
mountain of debt on their balance sheets. Share prices of top telcos 
have been beaten down mercilessly due to this very factor.

Just to give 
you a flavour of what we are talking about - Reliance Communications' 
total debt on March 31, 2012 was Rs 27,871 crore, Bharti Airtel as on end 
March was Rs 14,129 crore while Idea Cellular was Rs 10,138 crore.

Once the 
Supreme Court said transparent market forces should determine the 
auction reserve price, the cash-strapped government should have paid 
heed to market realities. Industry repeatedly told the DoT brass that 
the reserve price could not be linked to 3G auction prices.

A 
beleaguered government was keen on bridging the ballooning fiscal 
deficit and the 2G spectrum auction was manna from the heavens. But the best
laid plans of mice and men often go awry.

On the eve of the auction 
both the biggies from the CDMA space - Tatas and Reliance - pulled out. In
fact, Reliance did not even bid. Which left the foreign telecoms to 
plug and play.

The government of India made no ostensible move to engage
with foreign telecoms, there were no road shows, no hiking of 74 per 
cent cap in the sector as bait resulting in a desultory and 
disappointing auction.

Finally, the government has realised a paltry Rs 9,407 crore against an estimated Rs 40,000 crore. If I remember right, in 
2008 the government managed to bring in a tad over Rs 9,000 crore.

A 
scandal-tainted auction in 2008 has been reprised in 2012 viz the amount
raised. What the government required was fresh foreign capital. It 
could have been more aggressive with its pitch with foreign telecoms not
present in India - but all to no avail.

It is Telenor which came forward
to bid and win six most populous circles, deciding to stay the course in
India where they had successfully managed to build a sliver of a 
business. Once again validating that those who bid, bid selectively and 
strategically looking to optimise with circles that according to the 
players had the highest potential for continued growth and 
profitability.

That nobody bid for all the circles was most telling. 
What was crucial for this SC-mandated exercise was a little foresight, 
some planning and vital insight into how telecoms function globally.

What it ended up doing was getting its maths all wrong and antagonising 
an already fractured industry.

A two-day auction is what it managed 
ultimately, against a 35-day gruelling 3G auction process.

Rs 9,000 crore 
ball park vs Rs 67,000 crore in 2010 is probably the rub of the green, but
an abject slap on the face of a government which got ahead of the 
curve.
