Stepping out in the Waldorf-Astoria's grand ballroom with the grace and poise expected of a debutante, British beauties Katie Dolan and Joanne McGuire take their place among the well-heeled daughters of America's elite families.

Adorned in billowing white gowns and elbow-length satin gloves, the girls joined others from across the United States and the world to be presented to 'polite society' at the New York City's 60th Annual Debutante Ball.

The participating young women are the crème de la crème of high society, come to debut themselves to the sons and families of ambassadors, world leaders, and giants of business and industry.

Dressed in a strapless Oleg Cassini gown, Katie from Nottingham, England, danced and dined in the grand ballroom before being presented by an escort in white tie and tails. 

She was joined by Joanne, 23, from Edinburgh, Scotland, and other young women from the new generation of the international elite, representing 12 American states and countries from across Europe and the globe.

A graduate from the University of Hull and daughter of an ex-NHS worker, Katie now lives in New York where she works as an events marketing specialist for Thomson Reuters.

Joanne, who studied maths and psychology at Newcastle, is also currently in New York completing a finance internship.

While forty-six of the young women hail from the United States, by far the most represented country every year, about a fourth of the debutantes come from across the globe. Most commonly the international debutantes come from France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany.

This year, China, Hong Kong, Spain and Austria were also represented, among other nations.

They are college-aged young women putting their  faces forward in the Waldorf-Astoria's grand ballroom as they meet and greet with future husbands, friends, colleagues and business and charity contacts.

A day to remember: The 60-year-old tradition isn't the world's only debutante ball, but it is arguably one of the most celebrated

Globally known: The tradition sees mostly debutantes from the United States, but young women debut themselves from countries all over the world

Best faces forward: The college aged women attend in order to make what will likely become future husbands, friends, employers and business contacts

They  young women are from some of America's and the world's most prestigious universities

The men present at the ball are described as coming from as equally noble background as the young women

These daughters of nobility have for six decades used their beauty, glamor and magnetism to help benefit a range of charities

The tradition of debuting young and privileged women decked out in billowing white gowns and elbow-length satin gloves stretches back far beyond the first New York City ball in 1954, but the Big Apple's ball is the quintessential state-side cotillion.

Per the International Debutante Ball website:

The evening begins with the receiving line in the Astor Salon, where guests meet the debutantes and press and candid photos are taken. Cocktails are then served in the Jade Room and Basildon Room. After dinner and dancing in the Ballroom, each debutante is presented, one at a time, accompanied by a young man in white tie and tails. As the debutante walks down the center of the Ballroom to make her bow, the orchestra plays a song appropriate to the country or state represented. 

These daughters of nobility have for six decades used their beauty, glamor and magnetism to help benefit a range of charities that most notably include, according to the official site, ,the Soldiers’, Sailors’, Marines’, Coast Guard and Airmen’s Club of New York City, which for over ninety-five years has provided a home away from home for young men and women of our Armed Forces and those of our Allies.'
