A woman gave a stranger's baby a feeding bottle filled with bleach in a branch of McDonald's, a jury ruled today.

Elaine Joyner, 53, has been charged with administering a poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life, and jurors at Woolwich Crown Court today declared that she had fed bleach to the child.

The 11-month-old boy drank some of the liquid after Joyner handed it to him, then vomited from the poisonous effects of the bleach.

Judge Andrew Lees had previously ruled that Joyner was unfit to plead, and a trial to decide the question of what happened in the Eltham branch of the fast-food restaurant therefore took place in her absence.

Scene: The 11-month-old boy drank some of the liquid and vomited after being handed the bottle in a branch of McDonald's (pictured) in Eltham, south-east London, Woolwich Crown Court was told

A jury of five men and seven women took 
just half an hour to decide that it was Joyner who gave the child 
bleach, and that it had not been a case of mistaken identity.

The jury had been told by the judge that the main issue in the trial concerned the identification of the poisoner as being Joyner.

Police had compiled CCTV evidence which showed a woman carrying a baby's bottle, walking along the High Street in Eltham, and entering McDonald's, where she is seen to pass the bottle towards the boy.

'The prosecution say that this woman is the defendant,' the judge said.

'There is no witness present at McDonald's who has identified the defendant. However police circulated a still image showing the woman in the entrance of McDonald's.

'That was seen by Police Constable Sandra Voak who recognised the woman in the image as the defendant, who she had seen in July 2011.'

The judge said the jury could also consider that clothing similar to that worn by the woman in the CCTV had been found at the defendant's address, and also that Joyner's partner Fred Warwick, 68, had said she told him she had been to Eltham that day.

He earlier told the jury: ‘In this case the defendant has been found by me to be unfit to stand her trial.

‘I
have decided on the evidence of two specialist medical practitioners, 
one instructed by the defence, one by the prosecution, that she is 
mentally ill, such that she cannot understand the proceedings, cannot 
understand the evidence, and cannot give valid instructions to her legal
team.’

It was appropriate 
that she did not attend, he added. In such circumstances, there was not a
finding of guilty or not guilty, but the jury should instead decide 
whether or not she did the act she was alleged to have done.

'Some random person had given my baby a bottle, which he had drunk from and was vomiting. As far as I was concerned, my baby had been poisoned'

Peter Clark, prosecuting, told the jury yesterday that the incident took place last September at the McDonald’s branch.

He said: ‘Elaine Joyner, say the 
prosecution, gave to a complete stranger’s baby a feeding bottle that 
contained a poisonous or noxious substance, a fluid that contained 
bleach, or something very similar.

‘The
baby, who was 11 and a half months old, took some of that fluid in his 
mouth and was immediately rendered ill by it. He retched and vomited 
over himself and turned very pale.’

His
grandmother seized it from the pram to prevent further harm, Mr Clark 
said. The baby - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - made a 
good recovery with no long-term ill effects, he added.

‘Ingestion of bleach can prove fatal, and in the case of such a young child is particularly hazardous.’

A
statement from the child’s grandmother was read, in which said she was 
looking after the baby in McDonald’s while his mother was at the counter
and she saw him retching and dribbling.

‘I reached for a bottle that was in 
his pram. As I looked into it I noticed it was orange in colour with 
white milk particles in it. It was extremely frothy on the top.

‘I
realised that he had drunk something that we had not given him. Three 
black girls said that a woman had walked past and given him a bottle.’

The
mother said in a statement: ‘Some random person had given my baby a 
bottle, which he had drunk from and was vomiting. As far as I was 
concerned, my baby had been poisoned.’

Trainee Detective Constable Sandra Voak - formerly a uniformed Police Constable - told the court she had identified Joyner from a CCTV photograph from that day last September as someone she had dealings with in 2011.

She said she spent an hour with her in July that year, including 15 minutes sitting next to her in a car.

Asked by Stella Harris, defending, if she was sure that the person she had seen in the CCTV image was the same woman she had dealings with in 2011, she said: ‘I am absolutely certain that is the same person.’

The hearing has been adjourned until July, when Joyner will attend court to discover how her case will be dealt with.
