Tori Spelling's tiny and diminishing frame has long been a source of speculation, and now her mother, Candy, has opened up about her own struggles with an eating disorder, in her explosive new memoir Candy At Last, according to RadarOnline.

Although her daughter has publicly denied being anorexic in the past - despite jokingly referring to her 'keep your f***ing mouth shut' diet - Candy certainly seems to imply that deep rooted food issues run in the family.

'Once Tori was born, I got even thinner than I had been before I was pregnant,' she writes, detailing how she 'deprived' herself of food. '[My husband] Aaron always thought I looked terrific, but I still couldn’t see how I really looked.'

Tell-all: Candy Spelling has confessed to having 'body images' issues and 'depriving herself of food and binging' in her explosive new memoir Candy At Last

In the newly released book, Candy confesses that she has 'body dysmorphic syndrome' - a mental disorder which makes it difficult for sufferers to see themselves as they really are.

'I perceived an imaginary defect in my body,' she reveals. 'This started in my teen years, when, like most other girls, I was very preoccupied with my appearance.'

The 68-year-old matriarch, who has been in and out of bitter feuds with Tori for decades, said she went through cycles of starving herself and binging whenever things got tough in her life.

The problem worsened, Candy says, when her husband, director Aaron Spelling, died from cancer in 2006.

Instead of 'reading a lot of books' or 'taking up a new hobby', she fell back into her negative eating habits before finally deciding to see a psychologist.

'I realized I had body image issues and that I was eating to comfort myself,' she writes. 'My relationship with food and my ability to discuss my feelings are a work in progress.'

More Spelling drama: Candy's comments could be read as implying that she has unwittingly passed her eating disorder onto her daughter Tori, as the condition is known to be hereditary 

Tori, who has been struggling both with marriage problems and a recent agonizing spine condition, has seemingly been supportive of her mother's recovery.

'[Tori] wrote me a beautiful letter in which she shared that it was painful for her to hear how critical I am of myself,' she says. 'Children have different eyes for their parents.'

But unsurprisingly, it looks as though their strained mother-daughter relationship may be hitting the rocks once again in light of certain revelations which have surfaced in Candy's explosive memoir.

In it, she risks reigniting her long-running feud with her daughter by pleading to 'stop blaming your parents' and alleging that if she didn't buy Tori 'extravagant gifts' she would get cut off.

'I also believe that there comes a time when 
you have to stop blaming your parents. Take responsibility for your own 
actions and attitudes,' writes Candy.

But she does admit to not always being the perfect mother.

'I
 see now that in my quest to be the perfect mother and create the 
picture-perfect life for my children, I was too focused on the bigger 
picture and not enough on the smaller brush strokes. I feel badly that 
my children felt I wasn’t affectionate enough. I thought I was,' she 
goes on.

The mother and daughter famously fell out before Tori's media mogul father Aaron Spelling's death in 2006.

'I was devastated about Tori and [Aaron] was angry,' she claims in the book. 

'He left her numerous messages on her cell phone. I tried reaching her as well. Not surprisingly, we didn’t hear back from her,' she added.

Around this time, Tori started dating and eventually married Dean McDermott. But with no communication between them, it wasn't until Aaron's funeral that Candy ever laid eyes on her new son-in-law.

'It was very emotional because I didn’t know if she was going to show up. This was my first time seeing my new son-in-law Dean. A friend of mine couldn’t bear the awkwardness. "This isn’t right," he said.'

Adding to the tension was the fact that Aaron reportedly left his daughter $800,000, a fraction of his $500m fortune.

Candy - who is now worth a reported $600m - even goes on to say that Tori would cut her off if she wouldn't lavish the former Beverly Hills, 90210 star with expensive gifts.

'When I denied Tori an extravagant purchase, it resulted in radio silence,' she revealed.

Tori has been open about her financial struggles and how difficult it is to support four children now that her acting career has slowed down.

Although Candy claims their falling out was 'excruciating,' everything changed as soon as Tori gave birth to her first child Liam in 2007.

'We have never discussed that painful period in our lives when we didn’t speak,' said the 68-year-old.

'We just tried carefully to move past 
it. I like to think that it was her pregnancy that paved the way for us 
to resolve our issues.'

Double standards: While on the Today show, Candy revealed that watching 
True Tori is 'painful' - and in a letter she allegedly received from her daughter, Tori also said it was 'painful' so see her mother struggle

While they have their ups and downs, she now calls their mother-daughter relationship a 'work in progress' adding, 'We have a pattern, and until we can break it hand in hand, this is going to be the little dance she and I do together.'

But she says she does 'worry' about her daughter, who suffers from migraines and 'has her hands full,' even with several nannies.

During an appearance on the Today show on Monday, the author revealed that she is watching the Lifetime docu-series True Tori but that it isn't easy.

'As a mom, you don't want to see your children hurt in any way, and I have to say that it's painful for me to watch it,' she revealed.
