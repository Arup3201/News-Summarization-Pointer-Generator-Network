A man who missed his connection at Grand Central Station in 1973, but met a woman there that he connected with instead, is trying to track her down 40 years later - and internet users are doing their best to help him.

His post to Craigslist’s Missed Connections section described his brief encounter and the feelings he still has for the woman he never saw again after spending just one night with her, but it was taken down.

Now Reddit user SXMGirl has decided to give him a helping hand and has re-posted the tale  - named The Most Beautiful NYC Missed Connection I’ve Ever Read - to the social media site in the hope that it’ll go viral and the mystery woman can be found.

On track for romance: The man met the girl in 1973 in Grand Central Station and is hoping that he might connect with her again

All that’s known of the man who penned the post is that he’s a 58-year-old English professor.

He described how the woman he met on the eve of Thanksgiving emerged from one of the platforms ‘with a look of utter confusion’ and that he found ‘uncharacteristic courageousness’ to walk up to her and ask ‘are you lost?’

After that they left the station and had a beer in the nearest bar.

They should have dashed off to meet their respective families, but instead spent the night together and lay in bed the next day ‘sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes’.

Romantic: The post describes a random encounter and the author's hope that they can be reunited

He only heard from the girl once afterwards, in a letter with no return address, but admits to reminiscing regularly about someone he felt a ‘true connection’ with.

He wrote: ‘I have never felt more at ease with anyone than I did laughing and talking to you.’

The man is now a father, having been married twice, but wonders if the girl of yesteryear might like to meet up for a second drink.

The story is reminiscent of romcom Sliding Doors, starring John Hannah and Gwyneth Paltrow, which explored how the simplest of decisions can affect our love lives.
