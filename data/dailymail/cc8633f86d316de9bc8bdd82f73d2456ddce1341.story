The Metropolitan Police are urging fans at Selhurst Park to help them find the culprit who threw a coin which struck Fabricio Coloccini in Newcastle’s draw against Crystal Palace.

Officers in Croydon have opened an investigation but have so far been unable to identify who launched the coin, which hit Coloccini near his eye as he celebrated their goal in front of the Holmesdale End.

Police are working with the Football Association and Crystal Palace to hunt down the coin-thrower. They have been watching CCTV footage of when the incident occurred and have been taking accounts from eye-witnesses.
