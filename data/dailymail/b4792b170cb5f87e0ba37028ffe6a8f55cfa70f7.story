Calling for reform: Chief Constable Andy Trotter

Suspects are being ‘left dangling’ on police bail for too long, according to one of Britain’s most senior police officers.

Andy Trotter, Chief Constable of the British Transport Police, has joined calls for limits on the length of time people are left on bail before they are charged or released.

The move follows a spate of high-profile cases in which suspects have had their lives disrupted for  up to two years during criminal investigations.

Mr Trotter, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ spokesman on media issues, told The Mail on Sunday that he wanted a review of procedure. ‘I don’t think anyone can be happy with very long bail.

‘In the past police have released people without bail and that hasn’t stopped us continuing the investigation, particularly if they are unlikely to abscond.

'We have re-arrested them at a later stage when we have had sufficient evidence. That way, they are not left dangling.’

There is no limit on how long police can keep people on bail.

Sometimes there are stringent conditions attached, such as residing at a particular address and restrictions on movement.

Last night, the civil rights group Liberty joined calls for a review. Its director of policy, Isabella Sankey, said: ‘Bail is a vital tool in the police’s armoury. But with no time limit, lives are put on hold and days disrupted by burdensome bail conditions with no end in sight.

‘A six-month statutory backstop would encourage swift and efficient investigation – and end the uncertainty and fear of having the threat of prosecution hanging over your head indefinitely.’Mr Trotter said his ‘gut reaction’ was that six months would be a suitable time limit.

In one of the most high-profile cases, Neil Wallis, the former executive editor of the News of the World who was arrested on suspicion of phone-hacking in 2011, said his life was almost destroyed by the experience of being held on police bail for nearly two years, before being told he would not face any charge.

His solicitor, Phil Smith, said Mr Wallis was one of several clients who had been on bail that lasted more than a year. Mr Smith said the overuse of police bail was indicative of ‘lazy’ officers who made arrests before they had properly gathered the evidence.

He added: ‘These are not terrorist-type scenarios where you might need to keep people on protracted police bail. It ruins people’s lives and smacks of police inefficiency.’ More than 100 people remain on bail in operations linked to phone-hacking and corruption, many for more than a year.

Professor Ed Cape, from the University of the West of England, who is an expert on the subject, said it had become ‘an increasingly oppressive, undocumented and unaccountable power by which the police can restrict the liberties of thousands of innocent people every year’.

He added: ‘The use of police bail powers is in need of urgent reform.’

Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said: ‘It should concern anyone who believes in the rule of law that tens of thousands of people each year are held, sometimes for months on end, in the legal no man’s land of police bail. At the very least its use should be properly recorded and monitored so the police can be held properly to account.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We continue to keep police bail provisions under review to ensure they strike the right balance between protecting an individual’s right to civil liberty and allowing police to carry out thorough criminal investigations.’

Concern: Kenneth Macdonald QC, former Director of Public Prosecutions, should not conduct arrests in secret

Secrecy is one of the greatest curses to afflict British public life. It resides in the belief that some people (those in power) deserve to have information that others (the rest of us) do not.

Apparently, we’re not to be trusted, or the world is too complicated for us to understand, or important people in power  will be too scared to tell the  truth to each other if the rest of  us might be listening.

But this travesty of public  values has brought us nothing but disguised incompetence, national ignorance and undiscovered  sleaze. Secrecy has afforded few of the benefits that its addicts-in-power claim it will bestow, and the time for the rest of us to put up with being patronised has long since passed.

Sometimes secrets can be important. Nations are complex and they need protecting in a dangerous world. We understand that some things have to be hidden from view, where that is genuinely necessary, to protect the vulnerable or to defend our country in dangerous times.

Some secrets may be necessary for our own good, but a culture that celebrates concealment is not.  And, increasingly it seems, Britain is returning to a late and unlamented past where hiddenness is a way of life.

Naturally we are not alone in our addiction to censorship. Indeed the level of public information available in some European countries makes Britain look like a beacon of free speech and democracy.

Brussels, in particular, is notoriously furtive and closed, and it has been that way for 60 or more years. The opacity of the institutions of the European Union, and the unaccountability of its bureaucrats and its powerless parliament, are a disgrace that breeds no confidence in the laws and regulations that rain down upon us from across the Channel.

It is precisely this lack of transparency, this strange unknowability, which leads so many people in this country to distrust, even to despise an EU whose birth and purpose were and should remain so noble. Why, they think, should we pledge allegiance to a super-nation that won’t share?

And this is the problem with secrecy: it is tight-fisted. It allows no scrutiny, no accountability and, in the end, no justice or fairness – because justice, fairness and secrecy cannot co-exist. They are always in conflict.

This is why a deficit in transparency, the sense that things are hidden from the public gaze, brings a collapse in public confidence. People, rightly, don’t trust what isn’t explained and they don’t believe in things that hide away. Why should they?

You might think that the British police, above all, would understand this – particularly in a society where, traditionally, they have worked by consent rather than by brute force, and taken care to keep the peace alongside citizens rather than in ugly confrontation against them. But disappointingly, they don’t seem to get it.

It is, of course, true that the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) doesn’t really represent the police. Instead, it is an unaccountable club of senior policemen who have tended over the years to serve their own interests. But even so, their recent announcement that, when officers make arrests in the future, the identity of their prisoners will be kept secret from the public, is deeply shocking.

This new policy is, it seems, a poorly judged over-reaction to perceived media and police excesses in the past and, in particular, to the strictures of the Leveson Inquiry, which focused on the very worst media misconduct in recent years.

There are better means of protecting the public from press misconduct than by imposing a suffocating blanket of concealment – and many ways less damaging to the wider public interest.

So if ACPO believes the answer to a multitude of problems in criminal justice is more secrecy, they’re asking the wrong question. It seems unlikely that many members of the public believe that policing suffers from an excess of transparency. If there is a problem in the way that the police serve the public, most Britons would probably say the solution is more, rather than less light.

For ACPO not to see this is a bad mistake. Arresting someone is a serious business – a famous judge once described it as the beginning of imprisonment. In a free society, empowering men in uniform to restrain otherwise free citizens, to remove them from their homes, to put them in closed and locked cells – these are significant inroads into liberty, conducted solely at the discretion of the police. This serious exercise of state power should not be conducted in secret.

The Law Commission, which advises the Government on law reform, believes that there should be a general presumption that the identities of arrested people should be revealed, subject only to necessary exceptions to protect particularly vulnerable people or the progress of particularly sensitive police enquiries.

So far the reaction of the Government to ACPO’s foolish proposal has been singularly unimpressive. Perhaps David Cameron and Theresa May might like to suggest to senior officers that, instead of treating the public like children from whom everything must be kept hidden, they should show a little more trust in the people of the country they are sworn to serve.
