He can trill his way through theme tunes, beat box and rap - Disco the parakeet is a one-bird band.

The talented budgie can mewl like a cat and bark like a dog, and impersonate Arnold Schwarzenegger and Patrick Swayze.

In a string of videos, which have been viewed more than a million times, Disco shows off his pop culture knowledge.

Disco the parakeet has attracted more than a million views to his YouTube channel with his talent for rapping and singing

Dancing Disco has more than 70 phrases in his repertoire, including an avian take on Patrick Swayze's statement at the end of Dirty Dancing

He also performs musical tributes to Vanilla Ice, Styx and LMFAO in this funny compilation.

The three-year-old parakeet began speaking when he was four months old - and has learned more than 70 phrases from his owners Judy and Kevin Bolton.

The Boltons began posting videos of their chatty pet on their YouTube channel and set up a Facebook page where Disco's fans can catch up with his latest quotes and day-to-day life.

In this video, Disco begins by singing the Flintstones theme tune before beat boxing his way into the phrase: 'Bird to your mother' - an avian interpretation of Ice Ice Baby.

He tells the camera: 'Nobody puts baby bird in the corner' and 'hasta la vista, baby bird', before bopping his way into a version of LMFAO's Party Rock Anthem.

He sings: 'Disco budgie in the house tonight. Eat some millet and have a good time.'

Disco also chirps: 'Domo arigato, Mr Roboto' in tribute to the song by Styx.

A post on his Facebook page explains how Disco is a quick learner.

Disco, a skilled mimic, has also adapted Vanilla Ice's catchphrase

Writing as their pet, his owners 
explained: 'I think the fastest I have learned a phrase (it was sort of 
an emergency) was one day; it was a four-word phrase.

'Typically, though, I start repeating
- and repeating pretty well - a new multiple-word phrase within a week,
and I typically learn two to four new phrases at a time.

'According to my humans, I show a lot more interest in the longer phrases.'

A caption on the video from Judy and Kevin Bolton fondly explains what life is like with Disco in the house

Disco lives in Rochester, New York with his owners, a miniature schnauzer named Freddie, who is heard barking in the video, and Lu Lu the guinea pig.

His Facebook fan page lists his interests as his favourite foods millet, cilantro and red lettuce as well as being sung to, and making people laugh. He also enjoys chasing paper airplanes.
