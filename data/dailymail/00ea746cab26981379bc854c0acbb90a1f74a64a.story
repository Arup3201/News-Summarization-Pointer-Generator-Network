Thousands of rail passengers travelling on lines between London and Edinburgh faced massive delays this morning because of continuing problems with overhead wires.

Services were first disrupted yesterday evening and commuters were delayed for hours this morning after damage to power lines in Hertfordshire.

Trains were supposed to be running as normal from 6am today, but further problems were found, causing yet more misery for unhappy commuters.

Long wait: Rail passengers were left stranded at the London train station for hours following problems with overhead wires

The electrical problems were identified on two lines through Hitchin, Hertfordshire yesterday and trains between Stevenage and Letchworth garden City (for Cambridge) were cancelled.

The problem is affecting passengers with 
four train companies - East Coast, First Capital Connect, First Hull 
Trains and Grand Central.

A reduced service is now running between Kings Cross and Peterborough but with delays of up to half an hour, following three-hour waits this morning.

Replacement buses will be in place between Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City until the end of the day, but the line between Welwyn and Biggleswade has reopened.

East Coast ticket-holders may use CrossCountry trains on reasonable routes, including East Midlands Trains, First TransPennine Express trainsÂ  and Virgin Trains services.

Late: Services to Peterborough, Hertfordshire and Cambridge face severe delays and cancellations, with delays of up to half an hour between Kings Cross and Moorgate

First Capital Connect passengers may use Greater Anglia trains, London Underground services and Uno buses on reasonable routes.

First Hull Trains passengers may use East Coast trains between London and Doncaster.

Grand Central passengers may use 
CrossCountry, East Coast, Greater Anglia and London Underground services
and East Midlands Trains service.

National Rail advised passengers to delays journeys until tomorrow if possible.

It said 14 'droppers', which are part of the overhead wires, were found to be broken and contact wires damaged, causing damage to trains.

Rail bosses urged passengers heading away for the great Christmas getaway to stay in the capital for the time being, if possible.

An East Coast train company spokesman said: 'We apologise to passengers for the continued disruption to our services this morning.

'Earlier this morning, another train operator's service joining the main line at Hitchin was involved in an incident which led to reports of new overhead power line damage, following damage yesterday afternoon.'

A spokesman for National Rail told Mail Online today: 'We first became aware of the problem just after 2.30pm yesterday. Two lines through Hitchin had overhead wires damaged, which trains need to receive information.

'Two of four lines through Hitchin were then opened until later yesterday evening.

'Engineers have been there since 3pm yesterday, and are still there trying to fix the damaged cable.

'Between 1am and 6.30am, crews were replacing the damaged wires. Unfortunately, sometimes with these these problems, you only find out the extent of the damage when run a train through it, and we've discovered there is a lot more damage.

'Normal service will not resume until later this morning, and customers are advised to check with their operator for details.

'We do apologise for the continued delays and we are working to fix the problem.'

Elsewhere on the railways today, a broken-down train at Dumfries in southern Scotland meant buses had to replace trains between Carlisle in Cumbria and Kilmarnock, Ayrshire.

In the Manchester area, a signalling problem near Guide Bridge led to delays for passengers travelling between Romiley/Dinting and Guide Bridge on Northern Rail services, with limited replacement buses operating.

On the Tube, there were delays on the Northern line between Camden Town and High Barnet/Mill Hill East due to a signal failure at East Finchley.

The Hertfordshire overhead wire problem is the latest, and one of the worst, incidents which have plagued passengers in recent weeks.

After a comparatively trouble-free early autumn, rail services have been hit by numerous rush-hour problems as the darker days and colder weather arrived.

The next nightmare for passengers will be average season ticket rises of 4.2 per cent on January 2.
