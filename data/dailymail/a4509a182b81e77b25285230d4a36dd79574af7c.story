Arsene Wenger and John Terry are among a number of Premier League stars to have recorded announcements for the London Underground.

Their voices will heard be at Tube stations on Thursday as part of the Royal British Legion's London Poppy Day.

Other players to have recorded messages include Mikel Arteta, Andros Townsend, Joey Barton, Scott Parker, Rob Green and Ben Davies. The announcements will be played at stations close to each of the players' clubs.

Sir Peter Henry, London's transport commissioner, said it was a 'great honour' that the London Underground could be involved in the day.

He told ITV: 'It's a great honour for us to be supporting London Poppy Day again.

'This time of year is always poignant as the nation remembers those who made such profound sacrifices, and this year is particularly important as we mark the centenary of the start of the Great War.

'People living and working in London will see our specially wrapped trains and buses displaying the poppy design, in honour of the 4,500 transport workers who gave their lives in both World Wars and other conflicts.'
