A former Texas mortician whose killing of a rich widow inspired Richard Linklater’s movie Bernie was released from prison tonight – and promptly moved in with the renowned director.

A judge set a $10,000 bond for real-life Bernie Tiede after recommending that his life sentenced be reduced. A state criminal appeals court must sign off on the sentence reduction while Tiede is out on bond.

The now-55-year-old Tiede, who was well liked in the close-knit community of Carthage, was convicted in the death of his longtime companion, Marjorie Nugent.

Mercy: A judge released Tiede on $10,000 bond and recommended that his life sentenced be reduced after a psychiatrist determined that the crime he committed was a 'brief dissociative episode'

The 81-year-old widow had a reputation among townspeople as a crotchety cheapskate. The case inspired the 2011 dark comedy Bernie starring Jack Black in the title role and Shirley MacLaine as Nugent.

The judge has agreed to let Tiede live in an apartment above Richard Linklater's garage under strict bond conditions.

Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson, who was played by Matthew McConaughey in the film, agreed with Tiede's appeals attorney, Jodi Cole, who said he deserved a lighter sentence because he was sexually assaulted as a child and also had an abusive relationship with Nugent before her death.

Psychiatrist Edward Gripon, who examined Tiede in January, testified Tuesday that Tiede and Nugent had a complex and abusive relationship. He said that combined with Tiede having been abused when he was younger pushed him to kill Nugent in a ‘brief dissociative episode.’

‘He doesn't come across in examination at all as a person prone to violence,’ he said. ‘That set of circumstances ... is not going to recreate itself.’

Davidson, who said he believes residents' opinion of Tiede has changed ‘180 degrees,’ called Tiede's release ‘bittersweet.’ He said he had a duty, however, to act once it was clear other factors had led Tiede to kill.

‘I'm not telling you I like it, but there's not much I can do about it now,’ the plainspoken prosecutor said.

Tiede still faces a theft charge for spending Nugent's money after her death, but Davidson said nothing will move forward on that until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals approves the sentence reduction in the slaying case. No timetable has been set for when the court might act.

Nugent disappeared in 1996. Her corpse was found nine months later at her Carthage home about 150 miles east of Dallas, wrapped in a sheet lying among packages of frozen corn, pecans and meat. She had been shot in the back four times with a .22-caliber rifle.

Art imitating life: Linklater attended Tiede's murder trial and co-wrote the screenplay for his 2011 dark comedy Bernie starring Jack Black with a Texas reporter

Tiede had met Nugent in 1990 at the funeral of her husband R.L. ‘Rod’ Nugent, who had made his fortune in oil and banking.

Soon after, Tiede left his job as an assistant funeral director to become business manager for Nugent, who had become a close companion. Tiede's lawyers said Nugent had a reputation in the town of Carthage for being ‘a bully and unkind.’

'We had a ball,' Mr Tiede told The New 
York Times. 'I think I probably saw her happier than anyone in her 
family ever did. Including her husband. She kind of opened up to me. She
 became a different person.'But over time, Mrs Nugent became 
increasingly demanding, he told the News Journal, requiring Mr Tiede to 
clip her toenails, pluck the hairs off her chin and never leave her 
side.

'She
 was very possessive of my life — so much of my life — for the last few 
years. And it got worse,' Mr Tiede said to the paper. 'I guess that’s 
what made me just snap.'

The two would grow close, taking trips around the world, and Nugent signed a will leaving her estimated $10million fortune to Tiede.

Shocking crime: Tiede, pictured left and right, was found guilty of shooting Nugent in the back four times and stuffing her body in a freezer, where it was found only nine months later

Living the good life: Linklater's film portrayed Tiede, played by Jack Black, traveling around the world with his rich benefactor and living well on her dime

Upstanding citizen: Residents of Carthage, Texas, remembered Bernie Tiede as a generous man who started scholarships and showered his neighbors with gifts

Tiede became known around town for his generosity. Townspeople have said he started scholarships, pledged money to a church building campaign and ran a fundraising drive for Boy Scouts. He also gave away large gifts, including several cars.

After Tiede was charged in Nugent's killing, pretrial publicity led to the case being moved to San Augustine, about 50 miles southeast of Carthage. A jury there convicted him in 1999 and sentenced him to life in prison.

Ryan Gravatt, a spokesman for the Nugent family, told the Texas Tribune Tiede should stay in prison and serve out his sentence.

‘He confessed to her murder and his confession was admitted in his trial,’ Gravatt said. ‘A jury found him guilty and sentenced him to life in prison, where he should remain.’

Linklater, an Academy Award nominated director renowned for his Before Sunset trilogy, attended Tiede’s murder trial and co-wrote the screenplay for his 2011 film with a journalist who covered the case for Texas Monthly.

The 53-year-old filmmaker, who lives in Austin with his wife, Christina Harrison, has agreed to let Tiede live in an apartment about his garage after his release from prison.

Staunch supporter: Linklater (right) has called Tiede (right) 'a sweetheart of a guy' and said that there is no need for him to remain behind bars

Linklater has gone on the record as a supporter of the former mortician, calling Tiede ‘a sweetheart of a guy’ who did not belong in prison after all these years. 

‘Bernie's been in 12 years now.’ The director told the Houston Chronicle in 2012. ‘He has to do time, but I think he [got] an extremely harsh sentence. Bernie's not a psychopath or sociopath.

‘I think this was a heightened one-time event. He really is the nicest guy.’

During
 his trial, Mr Tiede said that he arrived at Mrs Nugent's home at 7am 
the morning of her death to make her breakfast.He noticed a .22-caliber 
rifle she kept around for shooting armadillos and scaring squirrels from
 her bird feeder and put it near the garage.

The two prepared to leave the house around 10am to head over to the dry cleaners when Mrs Nugent stopped to pet her dog.

Mr
 Tiede shot her four times in the back and stuffed her in the freezer, 
between flounder and chicken pot pie, where she lay for nine months as 
he spent her fortune.

'Bernie’s
 not the first one who thought about killing her,' said writer Joe 
Rhodes, who also happens to be Mrs Nugent's nephew. 'He’s just the first
 one who went through with it.'

Mitigating circumstances: Tiede's appeals attorney had said he deserved a lighter sentence because he was sexually assaulted as a child

Mr Rhodes recounted his relationship with his aunt as difficult, to say the least, as well as the trial for her murderer.

He
 visited the set of the film in Carthage, where the town welcomed the 
film with open arms and several residents even served as extras.

'There
 are little things in Bernie that aren’t exactly true, bits of dialogue,
 a changed name here and there,' Mr Rhodes said. 'But the big things, 
the weirdest things, the things you’d assume would have to be made up, 
happened exactly as the movie says they did.'

Many thought Mrs Nugent was the meanest woman in East Texas, he said, and her killer was one of the nicest folks around.

'There
 was something about Aunt Marge’s ending up in a freezer that seemed 
appropriate,' wrote Mr Rhodes. 'She’d always been kind of coldhearted.'
