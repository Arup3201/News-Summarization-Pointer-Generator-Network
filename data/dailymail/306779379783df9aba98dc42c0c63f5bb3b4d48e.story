The Little Museum of Dublin has a big new addition - a Mrs Brown’s D’Exhibition.

Featuring pieces of the set of TV show Mrs Brown’s Boys and costumes that you can try on, the showcase is a must-see for all fans of the hit BBC series.

The eagerly-awaited exhibition offers an exclusive look at the origins of everyone’s favourite foul-mouthed Mammy.

Huge success story: Creator Brendan O'Carroll as Agnes Brown in the hit BBC1 show

Visitors will also discover the fascinating background of her creator, Brendan O’Carroll, who grew up in Dublin.

Brendan left school in Dublin at the age of 12 and worked as a waiter, disco manager, milkman, pirate radio DJ and decorator before finding fame.

The comedian said he was ‘flattered’ by his success as Mrs Brown and the hit TV series ‘Mrs Brown’s Boys’ is ‘flattering’.

He said: ‘When you’re a father all you want is to make your kids proud.

‘I’m just sorry my mother never got to see any of this – the idea that her son would have an exhibition where he talks about his TV series and his books, it’s a pity she’s not here to see it.’

Dave Burke, General Manager of Universal Pictures International Ireland says: 'We’re delighted to be part of an exhibition which celebrates the life of a true Dublin hero.'
