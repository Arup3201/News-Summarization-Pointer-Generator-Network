These unusual pictures show a 1970s police car bizarrely transformed into a fully-functioning chicken coop.

French artist Benedetto Bufalino has utilised the entire vehicle to make way for the animals in his latest project called La voiture de police poulaillerí.

The Parisian bought the disused urban vehicle and gutted its interior apart from a few elements such as the steering wheel and 
clutch.

Fast food: This is the latest project of French artist Benedetto Bufalino - who bought and gutted a 70s police car to make a chicken coop

New home: The man removed virtually all of the vehicles' interior features and installed wooden and chicken wire structures to contain the animals

Most of its exterior remains - including the original signage, a vinyl police
 banner and blaring emergency lights situated on the roof.

Bufalino opened the passenger doors
 as well as the bonnet and boot to fit wooden structures inside meaning they will be perpetually ajar.

Chicken wire closes up the exposed 
openings and makes sure the livestock are stay in the space.

The artist says by transforming the car, its purpose has been renewed into a 
quirky artwork that can be interpreted as both a sculptural object and a
 functional piece.

Quirky: The artist has previously turned a car into a BBQ and a telephone box into an aquarium

The artist is trademarked by visually humorous transformations of certain objects - often cars and vans.

Previously, he has turned such vehicles into both a BBQ and an enormous plant pot.

He has also given a new life to an old telephone box by turning it in to a giant fish tank.
