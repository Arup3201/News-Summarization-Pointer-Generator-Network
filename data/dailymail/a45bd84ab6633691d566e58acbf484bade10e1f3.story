Luther Burrell is no one’s idea of a soft touch. Weighing 17st and with the physical attributes of a world-class athlete, the Huddersfield-born son of a chemical processor is a tough man earning a hard living in a sometimes brutal sport.

But Burrell, just like every professional sportsman, is also a human being.

Last season, at the end of a breakthrough Six Nations which saw the 26-year-old centre lay down a significant marker for next year’s World Cup, the physical and emotional demands of an eight-week campaign away from his family caught up with him.

‘I generally keep things close to my chest and don’t tend to share my feelings with other people,’ Burrell told The Mail on Sunday.

‘But the week after the Six Nations was really tough. Things caught up with me and I had to speak to [Northampton director of rugby] Jim Mallinder.

‘It was a pretty emotional conversation. I was a bit embarrassed because I’d never done that [broken down] before. But speaking openly about how I was feeling lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. The tournament had taken a lot out of us emotionally.’

Burrell’s emotional fragility was understandable following an intense tournament which began with bitter-sweet news for the former Leeds Tykes and Sale star. His joy at being handed a first England cap, against France in February, had been tempered by learning his mum, Joyce, had only just been given the all-clear following a major cancer scare.

‘Mum had a lump and she and the doctors thought it was breast cancer,’ he said. ‘They had to send off a sample for tests and it was a long time before she got the all clear. It was a huge time for my family. They were obviously overjoyed when they heard I’d been picked and there were plenty of tears.

‘But I was disappointed how the news came out about mum.

‘Mum and dad hadn’t really kept me in the loop because they didn’t want me to worry. It was a huge time for our family.’

As is the lot of professional sportspeople, Burrell had to suppress his personal worries and focus on winning matches. He scored a superb debut try as England lost a pulsating game to France before crossing twice more in the tournament as Stuart Lancaster’s men came agonisingly close to winning the Six Nations.

The subsequent meeting with Mallinder saw Burrell reset his sights and he went on to help his club lift the Amlin Cup and Aviva Premiership title with victory over Saracens in the final.

The next day he proposed to his childhood sweetheart Millie — after nearly doing so on the Twickenham pitch — before flying halfway around the world to play in England’s last two Test defeats against the All Blacks in New Zealand.

‘It was a funny tour because it had been a big season for the Saracens and Northampton boys,’ he said. ‘Saracens had also been in the European final against Toulon and then played against us in the Premiership final. Then we flew to New Zealand and played the first Test with a lot of emotional things going on.

‘We felt a bit of pressure to deliver, flying out two days after the final to start in the second Test.

That pressure of trying to back up what was a successful Six Nations but with less time spent together made it a tricky period. I think everyone involved learned a lot from that tour.’

With another huge season, beginning with the Aviva Premiership opener this Friday night against Gloucester at Franklin’s Gardens, and hopefully finishing with a home World Cup on home soil next October, Burrell has taken up the saxophone in an attempt to keep an even keel. 

'I didn’t want to learn the guitar because that is what everyone wants to play so I decided to buy a saxophone,’ he said.

‘I listen to the Blues and a bit of Northern Soul for inspiration. I absolutely love it. I’d like to play at our wedding. I had a chat with Ben Foden the other day and he’s going to play the guitar. We just need to find a singer.

‘I said “Between you and your missus [Saturdays popstar Una Healy] you can find a singer”.’

Injuries notwithstanding, Burrell — whose footballing abilities surprised many last season — is set to be a key figure in Lancaster’s squad despite fierce competition from other centres Manu Tuilagi, Billy Twelvetrees, Brad Barritt, Kyle Eastmond and soon-to-arrive rugby-league convert Sam Burgess. 

‘Ideally I’d like to be in the midfield with Manu but you just have to respect whatever pairings the coaches come up with,’ Burrell said. ‘I saw Mike Ford at Bath say originally that Sam was going to play back row so I’m happy with that!

‘It’s an incredibly exciting time to be involved with England. A home World Cup is going to be absolutely huge and I’m desperate to be part of it. Just look at the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.

‘I’ve said to the coaches that this year is about making small sacrifices for what could be a life changing opportunity at the end of it.’

But while Burrell has the world at his feet today, it could all have been very different had mum Joyce not emailed Lancaster — in his former role as Academy director at Leeds Tykes — to express her displeasure at her teenage son being overlooked in favour of a rival. ‘One of my team-mates at Huddersfield got invited to Leeds Academy and I was really unhappy about it,’ Burrell said. ‘It really got under my skin and I went home and sulked.

‘I told Mum this lad had been picked and she fired off an email. The secretary replied saying Stuart was happy for me to come along if I was confident I could cut it.’

A dual contract with Leeds Tykes and the Rhinos followed and Burrell spent a precarious four years living on £200 a month in student digs in Headingley alongside five other aspiring professionals. Only Burrell has gone on to make it into the top-flight. ‘I had nothing else to fall back on,’ he said. ‘I’d done my GSCEs and sports science A-levels but after that it was all rugby. I had to make it work. It didn’t bare thinking about if I didn’t make it.

‘When me and Millie talk about it now we always say how fortunate we are that I can do this and that it’s given us such a comfortable life. I’ve seen the other side when it doesn’t work out and I’ve seen people drop off the edge. It’s keeps me humble and motivated to keep getting better because once you get into a hole as a professional sportsman it’s hard to claw your way out.’

A frustrating spell at Sale following Leeds’ relegation in 2011 led to Burrell signing a two-year deal with Saints in 2012. Last season, after touring Argentina with England, he extended that deal by three years.

‘I’ve managed to turn my career around,’ he said. ‘I really did think Northampton was my last shot and I knew I couldn’t afford to not make it work. Thankfully it’s paid off and I’m loving my time here.

‘Stuart Lancaster always said I’d be a late developer and he was right.’

On the up: Burrell acknowledges he has 'managed to turn (his) career around' and is glad his efforts paid off
