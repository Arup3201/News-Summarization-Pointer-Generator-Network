New Year's Eve plans still up in the air and think you've left it too late to do something special? 

Apparently not. Trips  to some of Europe's most popular cities can still be booked for as little as £150, the lowest price available for return flights and two nights in a four-star hotel in Brussels over December 30 and 31.

The next best value cities are Lisbon (as low as £175), Dublin (£178), Budapest (£182) and Zurich (£191).
