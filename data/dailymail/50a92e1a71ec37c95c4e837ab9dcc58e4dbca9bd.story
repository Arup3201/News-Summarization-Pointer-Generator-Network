The Los Angeles Police Department is getting a Lamborghini.

But don't expect to see the exotic Italian sports car - decked out with police decals and painted black and white - pursuing fugitive drivers down the city's freeways on high speed chases.

Officer Sally Madera says that the car is privately owned and will be loaned to police for 'charity events and recruitment.'

Joining the force: Instead of being used for high-speed chases and organ transport, like the Italian police it'll only be used for charity events to support the LAPD Air Support team

All for charity: The LA Lamborghini will be used to serve charitable events for the LAPD Air Support Team

Nathalie and Travis Marg of a Los Angeles-based telecommunications company called Light Source 1, Inc., donated the use of their car to support the department's air support team.

According to Lamborghini's website, the 2014 model of the car has a top speed of 201 mph.

The LAPD Lamborghini has its own Twitter and Instagram accounts, as well as its own website.

'You can run, but you can't hide. Makes you wanna join #LAPD, doesn't it?' LAPD’s Rampart Division said in an Instagram post.

A 2014 Lamborghini Gallardo starts at about $182,000. According to the LAPDLambo account on Instagram, no tax dollars were spent on the vehicle.

The LAPD are not the only police force in the world to have such a flash vehicle at their disposal.

Dubai Police added a white and green Lamborghini Aventador to their patrol fleet  last February.

The city’s force confirmed at the time that their patrol cars were getting a sporty makeover to help patrolling on highways.

Top asset: Lamborghini launched the car being used by Dubai Police this year to celebrate its 50th anniversary

The Aventador will certainly be useful
 when catching criminals on the road, as it can do 0 to 60mph in a 
mind-blowing three seconds and has a top speed of a whopping 217mph.

Comparisons
 were made between Dubai Police’s version and Knight Rider, a series 
that focused on a lone crimefighter battling the forces of evil with an 
indestructible and artificially intelligent supercar.
