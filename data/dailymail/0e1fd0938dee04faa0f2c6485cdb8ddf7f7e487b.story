A Dutch teen had an epic meltdown after a bomb threat to American Airlines that she claims was a joke was referred to authorities.

Twitter user @QueenDemetriax_ begged for forgiveness and to be left alone after sending the threatening tweet Sunday morning and within minutes receiving a reply from the airline saying her IP address had been forwarded to the FBI.

She then pleaded with people to stop harassing her while gaining tens of thousands of followers and claiming she ‘blocked the FBI just in case.’

Bad idea: The teen immediately regretted sending this 'joke' bomb threat

Infamy: The girl claimed all she wanted was to be famous, but lamented finding the wrong kind of fame

‘Hello my name’s Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan,’ Sarah wrote Sunday. ‘I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I’m gonna do something really big bye.’

The airline’s reply was brief and to the point.

‘Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI.’

The girl then pleaded with the airline, saying she’s only 14-years-old and from the Netherlands, that she’s never been to Afghanistan.

‘What do you want from me?’ She pleaded.

It was to no avail, the airline did not reply.

It was just a joke: The girl insisted she was joking and not from Afghanistan, but the airline did not reply

Worried: The girl expressed her fear and threw her friend under the bus, anything to avoid being in trouble

Massive following: Her followers shot up over 30,000 by Sunday night

‘I’m so sorry I’m scared now.’ she wrote. ‘I was joking and it was my friend not me, take her IP address not mine.’

The airline did not reply, but Twitter users did.

Her followers shot from a couple thousand to over 30,000 by Sunday night.

She took note of the gain in followers.

‘I always wanted to be famous. But I meant like Demi Lovato famous, not Osama bin laden famous,’ she tweeted.

Humility: The girl claimed she was too busy flying around in her own jet to blow up a commercial one

Problem solved: Tweet deleted and FBI 'blocked'

Both the American Airlines and Sarah’s tweet were eventually deleted, and it is not exactly clear if any call to the FBI was ever made.

‘We took it down basically because it generated a lot of traffic,’ spokeswoman Dori Alvarez told the New York Daily News. ‘We took it down so we could better focus on our customers.’

Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to the New York Post, but tweeted that ‘only law enforcement can request private information about Twitter accounts.’

Sarah expressed remorse for the stunt, wondering aloud why she did it – but the she wrote ‘I changed my name to Ibrahim.’
