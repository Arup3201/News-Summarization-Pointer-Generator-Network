A man charged in the death of the 2-year-old son of Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson is back in custody after South Dakota authorities say he contacted the boy's mother and violated bond terms.

Joseph Patterson, 28, turned himself in to the authorities Tuesday. The Minnehaha County Sheriff's Office had issued an arrest warrant.

Patterson was released on a $2million bond in September. He is charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault in the 2013 beating death of Tyrese Ruffin.

Biological father: Peterson, 29, had learned of Tyrese's existence two months before his slaying

Patterson also faces aggravated assault and kidnapping charges in an alleged attack on Tyrese's mother, Ann Doohen, in June 2014.

Patterson was living with Doohen in Sioux Falls when on October 9, 2013, he called 911 and reported the boy had stopped breathing. Doctors determined Tyrese's fatal head injuries couldn't have been accidental.

Less than two weeks later, Patterson was indicted on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges carrying a mandatory life sentence. 

Prosecutors say Patterson beat the boy to death, but the suspect maintains 2-year-old Tyrese choked on a snack.

According to court documents, Patterson violated a protection order by inundating his ex-girlfirend, Tyrese's mother, with more than a dozen phone calls within minutes over the weekend.

Miss Doohen told authorities the first call came just after 3am Saturday.

Although no number showed up on the caller ID, the woman said she recognized Patterson's voice. The same person called twice more within minutes.

One the third call, Patterson allegedly told Doohen he still loved her and wanted to get back together.

Domestic abuse scandal: In September, Peterson was arrested for repeatedly striking his four-year-old son, Adrian Jr, with a wooden switch

After she hung up, Patterson redialed her again, but this time Doohen put him on speaker and had her iPad at the ready to record their conversation.

Court papers obtained by Keloland indicate that Miss Doohen can be seen in the video recording telling her ex-boyfriend, 'I don't know what you want me to say, Joey,' to which he responds, 'Don't say my name.'

The 28-year-old allegedly proceeded to call Doohen 13 more times that night.

Vikings star Adrian Peterson, 29, had learned of Tyrese's existence two months before his slaying and only met him for the first time the day before he passed away.

'I was planning on seeing him and I had talked with his mom and had gotten some things together as far as financially helping her. Unfortunately, this situation took place and it's devastating,' Peterson said on the day of the boy's funeral.

In September, Peterson himself was arrested for repeatedly striking his four-year-old son, Adrian Jr, with a wooden switch. The boy was left with lacerations across his body.

The NFL suspended Peterson until at least April 2015 and in court he pleaded no contest to a lesser assault charge.

'I love my son more than any of you can imagine,' Peterson, who has six children, said outside court in November.
