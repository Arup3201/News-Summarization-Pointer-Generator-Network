Astronomers have witnessed the creation of a multiple star system for the first time, which may one day resemble the solar system of Luke Skywalker's home planet, Tatooine, in the film Star Wars.

Incredible images taken from a series of telescopes on Earth show clouds of gas in the process of developing into stars.

The pictures are providing new insight into how systems with more than one star, and even our own solar system, are formed.

A team of international scientists, including researchers from The University of Manchester and Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), looked at a cloud of gas approximately 800 light-years from Earth.

They focused on a core of gas that contains one young protostar and three dense pockets of matter that they say will collapse into stars over the next 40,000 years.

Of the eventual four stars, the astronomers predict that three may become a stable triple-star system, according to the study published in the journal Nature.

Seeing a multiple star system in its early stages of formation has been a longstanding challenge.

Astronomers used a combination of the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to make it possible, at last, to look at such a young system.

They also used the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), in Hawaii, to study a dense core of gas called Barnard 5 (B5) in a region where young stars are forming in the constellation Perseus.

‘These kind of multi-star systems are quite common in the universe,’ said Professor Gary Fuller, of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at The University of Manchester.

'Think of Tatooine in Star Wars, where there are two 'suns' in the sky. That isn’t too far away from something that could be a real formation.

‘In fact nearly half of all stars are in this type of system.’

He explained that seeing a multiple star system in its early stages of formation has been a longstanding challenge, but the combination of the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) has made it possible at last to look at such a young system.

Dr Richard Parker, of the Astrophysics Research Institute at LJMU, performed the stability analysis calculations on the system.

He said: ‘Observing the formation and subsequent destruction of these systems will ultimately help us to understand whether our own sun was once part of such a system and if it was, what happened to its stellar siblings.’ 

Of the eventual four stars, the astronomers predict that three may become a stable triple-star system. An artist's  impression on the left shows  the star and three dense gas condensations system, while the right panel shows the system after the stars are formed out of the condensations.

The scientists used the VLA and GBT, along with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in Hawaii, to study a dense core of gas called Barnard 5 (B5) in a region where young stars are forming in the constellation Perseus. This object was known to contain one young forming star.

When the research team used the VLA to map radio emission from ammonia molecules, they discovered that filaments of gas in B5 are fragmenting, and the fragments are beginning to contract to form additional stars - ultimately becoming a multiple-star system.

Project leader Jaime Pineda, of the Institute for Astronomy, ETH Zurich, in Switzerland, said: ‘We know that these stars eventually will form a multi-star system because our observations show that these gas condensations are gravitationally bound.

‘This is the first time we've been able to show that such a young system is gravitationally bound.

‘This provides fantastic evidence that fragmentation of gas filaments is a process that can produce multiple-star systems.’ 

‘Multi-star systems are quite common in the universe,’ said Professor Gary Fuller, of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at The University of Manchester. 'Think of Tatooine in Star Wars, where there are two “suns” in the sky [pictured]. That isn’t too far away from something that could be a real formation'

The pictures are providing new insight into how systems with more than one star, and even our own solar system, are formed. A simulation of the creation of the multi-star system is shown

Astronomers have previously said that mechanisms responsible for creating multiple star systems, include fragmentation of the main gas core of the star, fragmentation within a disk of material orbiting a young star and gravitational capture by one star of another.

‘We've now convincingly added fragmentation of gas filaments to this list,’ Dr Pineda added.

The condensations in B5 that will produce stars now range from one-tenth to more than one-third the mass of our sun, the scientists said. Their separations will range from 3,000 to 11,000 times the Earth-sun distance.

The astronomers analysed the dynamics of the gas condensations and predict that when they form into stars, they will form a stable system of an inner binary.

They predict that the other two stars will be ejected from the system.
