Found: Ella Hysom, who had gone missing during treatment for depression, has been found safe and well

A 15-year-old deputy head girl who went missing during treatment for depression has been found 'safe and well'.

Elly Hysom was found after she had been spotted by a member of the public in Ilford, east London.

She had not been seen since lunchtime on Monday close to a residential clinic in Goodmayes where she had been receiving treatment for six weeks.

Yesterday her parents made an emotional appeal for her return but today police confirmed she had been found.

Police search teams had been combing the area, and yesterday her parents asked for help in finding their ‘weak and vulnerable’ daughter.

Her mother Alison, 43, said: ‘Ella, darling, please just get in contact. We love you so much. You are so loved by all your friends and family. We just want you back, darling. If anyone has seen her, please get in touch.’

Her father Tim, 43, added: ‘We just want to know that Ella is safe, we want her back, but we want to know she is safe.’

A keen rower and ballroom dancer, Ella, who was deputy head girl at The Gilberd School in Colchester, was said to be ‘gregarious’, ‘lively’ and ‘confident’.

But her parents said she had become depressed, which had made her anxious and nervous.

The blonde schoolgirl’s Facebook page suggested she had split from a boyfriend who had found a new girlfriend.

Around the time she was admitted to the residential care unit in East London at the start of October, Ella left a series of emotional messages on Twitter.

Ella, who is deputy head girl at her school, is said to be 'gregarious', 'lively' and 'confident'

Ella went missing at about 1pm on Monday in Ilford, East London. She had been visiting Goodmayes but is from Colchester, in Essex

She wrote: ‘The higher I get, the lower I sink. I can’t drown my demons, they know how to swim.

‘I’m
 scared to get close, I hate being alone, I long for that feeling to not
 feel at all. Hold me close, don’t let go, watch me burn in this 
hospital for souls. Now it’s 3 in the morning and I’m trying to change 
your mind... Pathetic that this is all over a boy.

‘LOL [laugh out loud] bye bye world until I’m “healthy” again.’

Asked
 how she was feeling on the social networking site Tumblr hours before 
she went missing, she posted: ‘I just want to die and hopefully that 
will happen so I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning. Then I will 
feel okay.’ 

She had 
earlier written: ‘Every night I convince myself tomorrow will be 
different, but it never is... I feel kind of dead... boys don’t like fat
 girls. I think I’m more scared of living than I am of dying... Too 
young to be so sad.’

She had also posted an image of an arm covered in cuts.

In
 one of many posts about her appearance, she wrote on Twitter: ‘Just 
make my boobs bigger, My arse nicer, Give me a thigh gap, And make me 
skinny and I might start considering being happy with myself.

‘I say I’ll jump but never do. My life is so empty right now. Pretty girls make me want to die.’

Hundreds
 of her friends from school and the Sudbury Rowing Club took to 
Twitter and Facebook in a bid to trace the teenager.

sink. I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim... I long for that 
feeling to not feel at all'

Ella Hysom on Twitter

Ella's parents have also been using social media to try to track down their daughter who was missing for three nights.

Mrs Hysom posted on her Facebook page this morning: 'Thank you to all those who are helping to find Ella, whether it is by putting up posters, tweeting, via Facebook or providing information.

'We just want her home and safe x'

Family and friends have been putting up posters of the missing teenager, hoping that it could lead to a breakthrough.

Mrs Hysom also posted: 'Another way to reach Ella is to print off the official poster and put up in your car windows and in shop windows in your own local areas - anywhere that you think she might see them - thank you all for your support and please keep supporting x'.

On Monday, Ella’s parents, who live in a £320,000 home in Colchester, were told that she had gone missing.

Ella had been in Ilford receiving treatment for depression at a residential care centre

She
 had been last seen walking alone in a nearby road in Ilford at around 
1.15pm, wearing blue jeans, Ugg boots, a green coat and a jumper.

Her
 mother, who works for a management training company, said: ‘She has 
been suffering from depression for some time and she has been receiving 
treatment.’

She said 5ft 
9in Ella appears much older than 15, adding: ‘People will know her for 
being really outgoing and gregarious. She seems much older than her 
years.

‘Although she could easily pass for 18, she is only 15 and is in a weak and vulnerable position.’

She said Ella’s 11-year-old sister and nine-year-old brother were ‘visibly distressed’.

Her father, a company executive, said: ‘We are trying to cope and use all the means at our disposal to find Ella.

‘We have been out searching, helping the police to search, using social media to try to spread the news of Ella’s disappearance.

‘It has been emotional.’

Detective
 Inspector John Delaney said there was no evidence of foul play, adding:
 ‘We are concerned for her welfare because she is vulnerable, she is 
suffering from depression and she is just 15.’

A Gilberd School spokesman today told MailOnline: 'Staff and pupils are very concerned to learn of her disappearance and we urge anyone who has any information about her whereabouts to get in touch with the police.'
