Six months after her son was kidnapped by his father, a distraught mom has spoken out about her on-going ordeal and her hopes to see her son again soon.

Autumn Breci hasn’t seen her son Beck, 3, since she dropped him off with his father Corey Hotsenpiller, 21, at his home in Springfield, Missouri, late last July.

Hotsenpiller, who is 5ft 8in, 160 pounds, with blonde hair and blue eyes, has been charged with federal parental kidnapping.

Deputies in the U.S. Marshal’s Office believe he has been on the run with his young son since his disappearance.

‘There was an emergency custody hearing in August of this past year. Corey failed to show up or bring Beck,' said Deputy Mike Walker in the Springfield U.S. Marshal’s Office.

Breci told KSPR that she is also doing what she can and spends much of her time scouring the internet for signs of her son.

‘I look for relatives online and try to see if I can see any pictures of him, or any hint that he's with one of those family members,’ she said.

According to deputies, Hotsenpiller has no job and very little means when it comes to taking care of a baby

'I don't know who's helping Corey but I'm quite certain that Corey is being helped by somebody,' said Walker.

According to police documents, Hotsenpiller's father said he knew his son was going to leave the area with his grandson, but the location would not be 'traceable.'

Police said the father denied knowing where his son went.

According to court documents, the parents were in the middle of a custody dispute.

After Hotsenpiller missed a hearing in August, Greene County Family Division Commissioner Sue Chrisman awarded full temporary legal custody to Breci.

Chrisman also ordered Hotsenpiller to return Beck.

'You can't just hold a little boy hostage basically. Because he deserves to have his mom and his dad,' said Breci.
