A sleepy magpie was so tired it refused to get off the windscreen of a moving car - even when the driver started the windscreen wipers.

The bird was filmed hitching a ride by recruitment agent Stefano Capacchione as it clung onto his wipers for around 20 minutes.

The 26-year-old discovered the bird sleeping on the front of his car as he left a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London on May 20 with girlfriend Siam Cardy, 27, and friend Stephanie Lorde, 26.

He filmed it as he drove slowly down a residential street, trying to encourage it to fly from its makeshift perch.Â

Mr Capacchione, from Northampton, Northamptonshire, had been watching a concert by Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela.He said: 'It was quite funny when we found it sleeping on my windscreen - but after a while I just wanted it to leave.

'I couldn't exactly drive down a main road with a magpie on my bonnet.

He eventually managed to prise the bird free and it flew off to find another place to sleep

He added: 'The bird was obviously very tired and didn't want to be disturbed. But I was glad he flew away eventually so we could go home'

'Every time I went near, it just opened its eyes and looked at me as if to say "Please go away".

'I tried to move it but it wouldn't let go.

'It obviously loved my windscreen for some reason.'

Magpies are known as scavengers, predators and opportunistic thieves, which are attracted to shiny and brightly coloured objects.

The birds are surrounded by superstition and were once thought to be in league with the devil.

Numbers of the birds have quadrupled across Britain and Northern Ireland over the last 35 years with the increase most significant in suburban areas.

They live and scavenge in parks, gardens and bushland.

The birds can become aggressive during the breeding season, usually between August and November, when they will often attack passers-by.
