Britain's first £1 pub has opened its doors to punters chasing a cheap drink.

But customers may be in for surprise when they get to the bar - because a pint of beer will actually set them back £1.50

From 8am, bar staff at The Pound Pub in Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbrough, will serve half pints for £1 and a full pint for an extra 50p.

Bargain bar: The Pound Pub has opened its doors in Stockton, Middlesbrough, selling half pints for £1 and a full pint for £1.50

Menu: Bar staff will be serving a variety of soft and alcoholic drinks for the low prices, including Fosters, Theakstons, Strongbow and John Smiths

Fosters, John Smith Strongbow, Theakstons and a range of soft drinks will be available at budget prices, but 
residents fear the venue will attract the wrong sort of crowd to the town.

Local councillors, alcohol awareness groups and campaigners also believe it will be bad for the community, which already has a high number of people receiving hospital treatment for alcohol-related illnesses.

The makers of Channel 4's Benefits Street are currently scouting out the area as a possible location for the next series.

Carol Harris, 68, who lives in Stockton, said: 'My dad's brother used to run that place. It was a respectable old pub, The White Heart.

'Selling beer that cheap will be bad for the town, it will attract the wrong crowd. It is all wrong.'

Councillor Jim Beall, Stockton 
Council's Cabinet Member for Adult Services and Health, who is working 
to reduce the negative impacts of alcohol on the community, said: 'We 
know our Borough has higher than average rates of hospital stays for 
alcohol-related harm.

'We want to reduce the harmful impact of alcohol on communities, families and individuals.

'The sale of cheap alcohol in this pub, and indeed anywhere, does nothing to help us tackle these issues.

Concern: Residents in the north east town say the venue is going to attract the 'wrong sort of crowd'

Worries: Stockton has one of the highest rates of hospitalisations for alcohol-related illnesses in the UK

"The Council's Chief Executive spoke to representatives of this company to appeal to them to consider an alternative operating model but unfortunately they declined.'

The pub is raising fresh concerns over it's application to start serving alcohol at 8am.

Chair of the Stockton Town Team, Joanna Waker called the Pound Pub 'counter-productive' to Stockton's development.

She said: 'Businesses do not need to be low cost to survive in Stockton,

'Earls of Ashwood deli serving fine cheeses and The Storytellers pub serving fine and real ales from around the world - both of which are absolutely thriving - prove it.'

Early start: Punters will be able to make the best of the deal from 8am, when the venue's doors open

But Mike Wardell, a director at Here for Your Hospitality Ltd which owns the premises, insisted the pub would take part in responsible drinking campaigns, including challenging anyone who looked under 25 for identity.

He added that anyone drunk would not be served and pointed out that supermarkets are able to sell their own value beers at 40p a can - something which is not monitored by councils.

Mr Wardell said the PoundPub is aimed at the kind of person who would have frequented Working Men's Clubs in a previous generation and not the night-time market.

He said: 'It is an eye-catching logo and, I suppose it's a bit cheesy, but the phrase we're going for is "get more round for your pound".

'At a time when 12 pubs a week are closing across the country we have to think outside the box a bit.'

Hike: The average price of a pint of beer is £3.03, a five per cent increase since 2012

The average price for a pint of beer in the UK is £3.20, but it varies depending on where you are in the country. According to the Good Pub Guide, the average prices of a pint in different places are:

Wales: £3.15
