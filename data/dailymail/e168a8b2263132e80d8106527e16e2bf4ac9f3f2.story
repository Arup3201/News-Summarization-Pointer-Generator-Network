With his long experience, he must have the best ho-ho-ho in the business.

Britain's longest-serving Father Christmas has donned the festive suit for more than half a century - and has no intention of hanging up his beard and buckled red suit.

Grandfather Ray Hulse, 69, has been playing the bearded gift-bringer since he was just 18 and has been spreading yuletide joy for 51 years.

He is so committed to his role that he has built his own sledge and created a grotto out of his own garage.

Thousands of gleeful children have sat on his knee and he has distributed hundreds upon hundreds of gifts to make Christmas dreams come true since 1962.

He had always loved Christmas and was determined to spread the festive cheer as much as he could.

Retired carpet fitter Ray, from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, created his first grotto at a simple Ford garage - with people coming from far and wide to offer Santa their Christmas wish list.

He said: 'I started out there then I did one in a scout hut and it just grew from there.

'At first, I had to borrow a costume. But it soon took off and became so popular that I had my own costume made.'

'I used to ask for donations, I used to raise around Â£15 in old money. But it's got better and better since then.

'I'd raise money for the Church of England's waifs and strays, then I started to do it for other charities.

'I wouldn't like to guess how much I've raised down the years, but I imagine it must be around Â£50,000.'

Not only has he been entertaining children over all these years, Christmas-loving grown-ups have also sat on his knee

As the years rolled on, Ray took his role as Santa more seriously.

He built his own sledge - complete with 'Santa 1' registration plate - and he even had a custom-made suit created.

The hospitals Ray visits this year will all provide him with gifts to give to the sick children, which is a far cry from the early years when he used to beg high street shops for freebies for him to take around the wards.

But one thing that hasn't changed over five decades is the feeling the experienced Santa gets when he dons the famous outfit and says 'ho ho ho'.

Ray, who has two sons with wife Kath, 71,
 said: 'The magic is in the expressions that you see on the kids' faces.
 That's the reward.

'I have a few questions that I always ask, like 'What would you like for Christmas?'

'And I try to involve the parents. I'll ask the kids if they had a real fire, then if they say 'yes', I'll ask whether it was lit by their mummy or their daddy.

'Sometimes I'll joke with them, and tell them that they were naughty last year because their mummy or daddy left the fire burning and I burned my bum.

'Or I'll tell them I came down their chimney and got covered in soot.

'A lot of these modern houses don't have chimney pots, so I tell the children that Santa has a magic key.

'I ask if they want to touch it, the expression on their faces when they are touching my magic key is extraordinary.

'It's those little touches that make it special for them.

'I will continue until I am unable to do it - I'll keep on till I turn 100 if I can.

'It means I am out most days in December being Santa Claus but I love it.'
