Fed up of cramming into the lift at work in the morning?

Soon you’ll be able to drive into it instead – because the world’s smallest eco car is about to go on sale and it’s tiny enough to fit into office elevators.

The ‘Volpe’ is just one-metre wide, 1.5 metres tall, weighs just 350kg and can squeeze into the smallest of gaps, which means the commute to work can continue right up to the office, where the car can be charged at your desk.

Size matters: The commute to work can continue all the way to your desk with the Volpe

Proud: The Volpe designers with their tiny creation, which goes on sale next year for £5,600

Long-distance cruising isn’t really an option, though, since it only has a top speed of 30mph – and there isn’t much room for luggage.

The ‘Volpe’ is the brainchild of Italian Romano Artioli, former owner of the Bugatti and Lotus brands.

The mini-motor, which can also squeeze in spaces left between two parked cars on a regular street, has been launched in a bid to ease traffic congestion.

Styled by Zagato, the coachbuilder responsible for limited edition versions of iconic Aston Martin cars.

Compact: The miniature motor is road legal as a 'quadricycle'

Tight squeeze: The car has been designed for urban dwellers who have trouble finding parking spots

Isabella Artioli, vice president of Volpe, said: ‘Volpe is for every urban dweller desiring to move around town in style, independently, without losing time in traffic and to look for a parking space.

‘Our founder, Romano Artioli, has long researched new types of clean engine solutions.

‘It is not only an idea, Volpe is a precious instrument in the service of who lives in the city. It is freedom of movement, without a need to compromise.’

Light fantastic: The Volpe weighs just 350kg

Wheel-y convenient: The Volpe can even charge while you work away at your desk

The miniature motor is road legal as a 'quadricycle', meaning people as young as 16 can drive it with a motorcycle licence.  

When it goes on sale it will cost about £5,600.

It will be launched across Europe in early 2013.

Young at heart: Even 16-year-olds can drive the mini vehicle
