Guests staying at a five-star London hotel have described how they feared a terrorist attack after a suspected gas explosion ripped through the building, injuring fourteen people.

Around 500 guests had to be evacuated from The Churchill Hyatt Regency hotel in Marylebone after part of the building collapsed when the blast tore through the kitchen just before midnight.

Speaking while wearing his dressing gown as he waited for his belongings to be returned, 40-year-old Stewart Dyer told how he was initially afraid the deafening blast was a terrorist attack.

The 40-year-old, who was staying with his wife and nine-month-old daughter, said: 'We heard this huge explosion. All the electricity went off and we just heard sirens and the alarm.

'When you see something like that, you suddenly realise that you're not sure what's happened.

'I've never heard a bomb go off next to me so you never know.'

He added: 'We do need clothes for the baby - my wife is in a nightie with no underwear and no shoes.'

'We went down the stairs. On the first flight people were kind of panicked. I thought it was a drill. But then I saw that it was pitch black and I thought, there's something wrong.

'We get down here and there's chaos. This has been a shock.'   

Fourteen people were injured in a suspected gas explosion at The Churchill Hyatt Regency Hotel, London

Today, staff were retrieving belongings from guests' rooms. But people who had parked their cars underneath the hotel were told it was too dangerous to retrieve them.

Many of the guests - who have been evacuated to the Radisson hotel - have also had to cancel flights.  

Two men sustained leg wounds and had to be rushed to nearby hospital for treatment.

A further three people also went to St Mary's Hospital, while nine others were checked over at the scene and given the all-clear. Twelve of those injured were working at the hotel.  

London Fire Brigade - which is carrying out a separate investigation - believes the was caused by a gas leak. 

The establishment, in Portman Square, was evacuated after part of the building began to collapse 

The explosion began in the basement, just before midnight. It is believed to have been caused by a gas leak 

At the height of the incident, around 80 firefighters were on the scene, including appliances with specialist equipment to deal with collapsed buildings. 

Nawaf Albarrak, 32, from Saudi Arabia, felt the explosion from his room in the Radisson hotel across the street.

'I felt something, and I was afraid it was maybe an explosion or something.

'Then my sister came back along the road, and she said there are ambulances and a lot of people here. I saw everybody outside, there were too many people.

'They took people inside. There were people in pyjamas and people without coats. They gave them blankets. I think they did well.

'I hope they've taken them to another hotel because they were standing around. I felt it, I heard the sound. I thought it might be an accident, a car crashing into the hotel.'

Mr Albarrak was originally supposed to be staying in the Hyatt but changed his reservation to the Radisson opposite just before he arrived.  

A spokesman for the hotel told ITV no guests were harmed and that they would be relocated until the damage was assessed. 

 Police, ambulance and firefighters were at the scene where several people were treated for shock 

Six fire engines attended the scene and two men sustained leg injuries from the incident

It said: 'Hyatt Regency Churchill in London experienced a gas explosion in the basement early this morning. Twelve Hyatt associates were treated for injuries. 

'No guests were injured, and all guests were evacuated to nearby hotels. Hyatt's top priority is the safety and wellbeing of our guests and associates, and we are currently working to provide guests with accommodations while we evaluate whether the hotel suffered any significant damage.' 

Jeanette Unsworth, spokeswoman for the National Grid, said: 'We're still investigating. We obviously had to spend a little time last night making sure the situation was safe.

'We were waiting for the emergency services to do their work of getting the injured people out, and we'll be on scene today investigating to establish the exact cause.'  

She said it was 'too early to say' what the exact cause of the blast had been, and they did not know how long the investigation would take. 

A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said: 'The cause of the explosion is being investigated but is believed to have been caused by a suspected gas leak. Duty of care has been handed back to the hotel.' 

Police officers were also called to the scene and a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'At about 11.40pm we were called to a suspected gas explosion at Portman Square.

'Officers are in attendance alongside the fire brigade and ambulance service. A small number of injured parties are being treated .'
