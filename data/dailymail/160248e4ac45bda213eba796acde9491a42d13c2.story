The owner of an infested takeaway restaurant has been fined after a child found a cockroach baked into their pizza crust.

Matloob Hussain, 44, was ordered to shut down his business after the bugs were discovered scuttling around in pans, inside chiller cabinets and running up the wall.

Cooking equipment and surfaces were filthy and covered in years worth of dirt, grease and food debris, Leeds Magistrates’ Court heard.

Infested: The cockroach baked into the child's pizza at Munchies takeaway in Leeds

Filthy: Environmental health officers who found the kitchen to be overrun with insects and full of mouldy food

Bags of mouldy doner kebab meat were on the floor and food were found stored directly on filthy surfaces at Munchies takeaway at 21 Harehills Road in Leeds.

It was immediately closed down by environmental health officers when they saw the state of the food preparation areas.

Fined: Former owner Matloob Hussain

Derek Hallam, prosecuting, said a child’s father reported the matter on August 22 last year after one of his children spotted the insect in a pizza.

Situated near the city centre, the American-style takeaway is used as a regular treat by residents in the Harehills area of Leeds.

Its website offers 'special calzones' and 'vegetable calzones' as its specialities.

Hussain was fined £750 and ordered to pay £1,250 court costs after pleading guilty to eight offences relating to failing to keep his premises clean.

Justice of the Peace Bill Baker said: 'What we have heard this morning has been a stomach-churning horror story.

'We are due to have lunch in three-quarters of an hour but I think we will skip it now.'

Speaking after the hearing, Councillor Mark Dobson said: 'Munchies took the idea of a stuffed crust pizza to a whole new level.'

The
takeaway was shut down and re-opened a week later after the place was 
cleaned and pest control contractors were called to the premises.

Fazal Karim, mitigating at the case on Friday, said Hussain no longer owned the business.
