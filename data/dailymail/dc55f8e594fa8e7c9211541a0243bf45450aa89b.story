Roy Hodgson warned on Thursday he will ditch England players who say they are too tired to train as the fall-out continued from last month’s Raheem Sterling rumpus.

Sterling was axed from the Euro 2016 qualifying win in Estonia after complaining of fatigue. And in a clear message ahead of the Slovenia clash at home on November 15 and the friendly against Scotland three days later, Hodgson said he would not tolerate any similar episodes.

England’s head coach, who called West Brom striker Saido Berahino into the senior squad for the first time on Thursday, also criticised the FA for allowing an American football match to be played at Wembley on Sunday.

Liverpool star Raheem Sterling was rested by Hodgson after he complained of tiredness

Hodgson, who is no longer on speaking terms with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers over the Sterling situation, said: ‘If a player came up to me one day before the game, when I was intending to play him, just before the session started, and said to me: “I don’t think I can train today because I’m feeling too tired”, then I would definitely leave him out.’

Rodgers disputed Hodgson’s version of events after Sterling was left out of the starting XI for the 1-0 win over Estonia and replaced by Adam Lallana.

Hodgson added: ‘Unfortunately I have 30 witnesses and Brendan was not there. If that’s all it is, he got the wrong end of the stick and I would be happy to put him right and I would be happy to talk to him about it. He was not there.

Saido Berahino's impressive start to the season has earned him a call-up to the England suad

‘He (Sterling) came just before we started training. I never said Raheem said he was too tired to play. He did play and got us the free-kick which won the game. I said he said he was too tired before training and as a result I left him out of the team.’

Hodgson was in a cranky mood at times on Thursday and the state of the Wembley pitch was among his bugbears.

The FA have hired out the stadium for another American football match, this time between Dallas Cowboys and Jacksonville Jaguars, just six days before England play Slovenia. 

The 67-year-old said: ‘I am a football coach, a football manager, not American football. I don’t really think you could expect me to say, “Excellent, delighted, well done”. But I’m realistic, I’m pragmatic and this match has been organised for a period of time now.

‘The pitch, unfortunately, is not in the best of nick anyway, which we’re all a bit unhappy with. I am not exactly jumping for joy. But at this particular moment I would honestly have to say if asked if it was a good thing or not, I would have to say not.

‘I can do nothing about it and we won’t use it as an excuse. We will get on with it. Hopefully in the future the pitch will recover to its normal level and when it has done that we will be better able to support this type of activity.’

Although Hodgson put pressure on Club England managing director Adrian Bevington to find a solution, the FA have already agreed to stage a series of American football games next year. Miami Dolphins and New York Jets face each other on October 4, five days before the return Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia.

Hodgson was more upbeat about Berahino, who has been fast-tracked into the senior side after impressing in Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 team.

The striker’s rise has been extraordinary. He arrived in England from Burundi aged 10 to join his mum and sisters after his father was killed in the civil war.When he scored against Finland for England’s Under 21 team, he lifted his shirt to reveal the words: ‘RIP, love u dad’.

Hodgson said: ‘I know him quite well because I brought him into the first-team squad at West Brom. Dan Ashworth (head of elite development at the FA) has been a very important person in his life.

‘What he has is pace, a desire to run beyond defenders and composure when he finds himself one on one with the goalkeeper.’

Hodgson also revealed that right back Glen Johnson has slipped behind Nathaniel Clyne and Calum Chambers in the pecking order.

‘I haven’t spoken to Glen and I don’t always speak to players that I don’t select in the squad,’ Hodgson added. ‘I know he has not been at his best and he would be the first to admit that.’
