It wasn't the most inspired chant you'll ever hear in a football ground, but it was topical and certainly cutting.

'Raheem Sterling, he sleeps when he wants,' sang the Queens Park Rangers fans during the opening minutes at Loftus Road in reference to the 'Tiredgate' affair.

And, in the first-half at least, it neatly summarised Liverpool - and Sterling's - slumbering performance.

But the most scrutinised and talked-about teenager in the game was certainly alert and awake when it mattered to help the Reds to a much-needed victory late on.

First, Sterling was pretty much in a sleeping position on the turf when he nudged a free-kick short to Glen Johnson after 67 minutes, catching the still-protesting QPR defenders out.

The right-back crossed low and dangerously, with Richard Dunne kindly supplying the finishing touch for the 10th own goal of his Premier League life - a most unflattering record.

And then, after Eduardo Vargas had brought QPR level with three minutes remaining, it was Sterling who, with trademark acceleration, carried Liverpool forward on the counter.

The move culminated with Philippe Coutinho, on as a substitute, curling the ball home to restore Liverpool's lead as the clock ticked over into stoppage time.

But the drama wasn't over yet. Step forward Sterling for his third influential act after Vargas had brought QPR back to 2-2.

There were sparks coming from his heels as he sprinted down the left channel, sending in the low cross that Steven Caulker turned into his own net for the decisive goal.

They were three pieces of sharp-thinking you certainly wouldn't associate with a man feeling fatigued from the strain of carrying responsibility for club and country.

With hindsight, perhaps it wasn't the best idea to inspire him with that chant. Sterling was excellent here once he was wound up.

Sterling dominated the headlines during the international fortnight after asking England manager Roy Hodgson to leave him out the starting line-up for the Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia.

That chat, and Hodgson's decision to disclose it, sparked endless debate but on the evidence of this sunny afternoon in west London, Sterling is looking not only fresh but on the top of his game.

It would be interesting to know Hodgson's thoughts as he sat alongside QPR chief Tony Fernandes and local hero Les Ferdinand high in the stands.

He had come to make peace with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers after the latest unedifying club vs country war of words.

Sterling has looked energetic in training all week and it's easily forgotten amid the hubris that he played the last half-hour and made an impact in Tallinn, winning the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney scored the winner.

Prior to this match, Sterling had played 1,967 minutes during this calendar year, more than any other player under the age of 21. Burn-out affects even the precocious but Rodgers had no hesitation in throwing him in.

'He felt fantastic to play so I'm looking forward to him getting on and showing how good he is,' said Rodgers on Sky Sports before the match.

Unfortunately in the opening 45 minutes he looked as lost and languid as the rest of the Liverpool team.

The Korean Yun Suk-young contained him with ease and he was snuffed out every time he attempted to break away.

There was one intelligent through pass in the direction of Mario Balotelli, whose failure to reach it was symptomatic of his disappointing afternoon.

At one point, he was outpaced by Karl Henry despite being nearer to a loose ball. It epitomised Liverpool's first-half funk.

But he was a changed man and they were a changed team after the break. The tempo was raised, passes were crisper, crosses lethal, as Dunne found to his embarrassment.

The game hung in the balance right until the final peep of Phil Dowd's whistle but Sterling made the difference as the best and the brightest players do.

'It's always good to play football, it was no different this week,' he said modestly afterwards.

He'll be glad a tricky week is over - and with the perfect ending.
