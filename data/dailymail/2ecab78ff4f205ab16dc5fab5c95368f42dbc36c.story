A sequin-clad Sarah Palin today dismissed suggestions that Chris Christie could turn around the Republican party as she refused to throw her support behind him.

The former Alaska governor told the Today show she was glad the New Jersey governor won at the polls last week - but fell short of embracing him as a potential GOP presidential candidate in 2016.

'I would never put my hope and faith 
in any one individual,' she said, dodging the question of whether she supported him. 
'There is no Ronald Regan on the scene today.'

Christie had an easy victory at the 
polls last week - scoring votes from women and Hispanics in a sign he is
appealing to voters other Republicans have historically been unable to 
touch.

Of the win, Palin added: 'Right on! Beats the alternative.'

She has previously attacked Christie for his famously outspoken style.

'Some people look at him as, "Ah man, he's a governor who goes rogue",' she previously told Fox.

'No,
he's got a schtick going there where he's got a YouTube videographer 
following him around, kind of these set-up situations sometimes so he 
can be seen as perhaps a little bit avant-garde and going rogue on 
things.'

Palin had also appeared on the Today show on Monday to slam 
Obamacare and said she rejected President Obama's apology over the slow, beleaguered start to the new health plan.

'What apology?' she asked. 'The broken website is the least of America's worries. It's symbolic of broken government.'

She praised some of her party members, including Ted Cruz, for standing up against Obamacare, but slammed others for allowing the end of the shutdown without defunding the bill.

But when pressed to say what the tea party would replace Obama's program with, Palin said only that an alternative plan should involve such things as a more free-market approach and tort reform.

'Most Americans will not be able to keep policy and programs that they had desired,' she argued. 'The new policies are unaffordable.'

Palin also voiced her anger at an 
event in Des Moines, Iowa - the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's 
Friends of the Family Banquet - on Saturday.

She told the Christian conservatives in attendance it was time to 'stiffen our spines' for the next elections.

Troubled: Obama's apology last week about the beleaguered health plan fell short, Palin said

'I want to encourage you to make your voice heard, to hold politicians accountable,' Palin said.

She drew thunderous applause with her sharp attack on Republicans in Congress who voted in October to raise the nation's debt ceiling and reopen the government.

'They promised that they would do everything in their power to fight against socialized medicine, against Obamacare, but when it came time to stand and defund it, they waved the white flag of surrender and they threw under the bus the good guys who did stand up and fight for us,' Palin said.

She was also on Today to promote her new book, Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, in which she says that Christmas is under assault from 'atheists and secular liberals'.

'We need to protect the heart of Christmas, not let some atheists with an attorney - a scrooge - to tell 
them they can't celebrate,' she argued.
