A girl was just two heartbeats from death - when she was given a heart transplant moments before her own heart failed.

Jessica Elliott, 12, who was born with a congenital heart defect, suffered a stroke last year, and was wheeled in for life-saving surgery 10 days later.

When removed from a patient, most hearts continue to beat for up to two minutes - but Jessica's stopped while still in the surgeon's hand, leading medics to conclude she had only seconds to live.

Now Jessica, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, is recovering and able to play with her friends and is going back to school.

Mother Michelle, 46, and father Alan, 43, an aerial and satellite engineer, rushed Jessica to Newcastle Freeman hospital after she suffered a stroke in April 2012.

Ten days later Jessica - who also suffers from cerebral palsy - was given the transplant that she desperately needed.

Her parents even bought her a puppy, called Freddie, before she went into hospital - as motivation for her to get better.

Mrs Elliott said: 'Jess was born 10 weeks early, with a congenital heart defect. She was tiny, just 3lb 7oz.

'She was on life support for two months before slowly improving. She had her first pacemaker when she weighed 6lb 10oz - at around eight months old.

'We struggled on with her condition for the next few years. She then had another pacemaker in 2008.

'We were devastated to learn in September 2011 that her only way forward was a heart transplant.'

Mrs Elliott went on: 'She had a stroke in April 2012 and was rushed to Newcastle Freeman Hospital. Ten days later we were told there was a heart for her - which was flown up from London.

'When they found a heart for her, it was overwhelming for us - but we didn't want to scare her or disappoint her.

'She was in theatre for ten hours. I was terrified - I didn't know if it was the last time I would get to see her.

'They sent a message down from surgery to say her old heart had served her well - but we weren't sure what they meant.

'We knew she was cutting it fine. The next morning, her surgeon Mr Hasan said that when he took her heart out there was just two beats left - then the heart failed.

'Normally they can beat independently - but after two beats Jessica's just went.

'It was a very close-run thing. We felt huge relief and the surgery was just in time. We had no idea how close she was to dying. We were shocked that it had got so bad. She was sedated for days afterwards and came out of hospital three weeks later.

'The first thing she said when she came round was "where's my dog Freddie?" I was so relieved.

'The first year is really tricky, as we could never be sure that her body would accept the transplant.But Freeman hospital has one of the highest survival rates in the world.

'Since the transplant she's brighter and happier, she's back to her old cheeky self.

'Before, her lips were blue and she used to have to wear three pairs of socks because of poor circulation.

'She's going back to school and is working with the physio to help her cerebral palsy. She wants to get back to swimming and walking her dog Freddie.

'All the people at the hospital were amazing and we're extremely grateful.'

Jessica Elliott was in and out of hospital after she was born with a congenital heart defect

Michelle said she was terrified when her daughter Jessica went in for the transplant op, in case it was the last time she saw her

Her surgeon Asif Hasan, 56, said: 'Her heart was on its last legs - she wouldn't have survived too long. The transplant came just in time for her.

'When I did the transplant her old heart seemed to fade away very quickly - suggesting it did not have long left. It was unusual. She was quite lucky.

'If she hadn't had the transplant when she did, she could have died suddenly.

'It's wonderful to know she's getting back to school and very satisfying to see her getting back to normal life.

'If a patient survives the first year after a transplant, like Jessica has, they're looking at a good outcome. I'm delighted for her.'

Lynne Holt, Transplant Coordinator, from Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, said most hearts beat for up to a minute or two after removal.

She said: 'Jessica's heart was obviously a very poorly heart. The nature of the muscle inside the heart is so unique, a healthy heart - not that you would remove one of those - will usually beat even when it is removed from the body for some time.

'The donor heart is healthy, but the body is cooled so it is not beating when it is removed. Once that heart is sewn into the transplant patient it often begins beating of its own accord once it is warmed and blood starts flowing.'
