As cast members on Downton Abbey, they have captivated the nation with their tales of upstairs-downstairs life in 1920s Britain.

But how does the real ancestry of the actors and actresses compare to the characters they play?

With the help of genealogy experts, MailOnline can today shed light on the family histories of some of the biggest stars - and they are far closer to the fiction than you might imagine.

'Upstairs' heritage: Elizabeth McGovern (left), who plays the exquisitely turned-out Countess of Grantham in Downton Abbey, is the great granddaughter of the respected U.S. diplomat Ethelbert Watts (right)

Fitting: The findings from Ancestry.co.uk show how in real life Elizabeth McGovern's family would be much more likely to be 'upstairs' dining with the Crawley's. Cora is pictured here with Lady Rose

Educated: McGovern's great grandfather Charles Montgomery is listed in this 1920 U.S. Census as a physician

The findings from Ancestry.co.uk show how in real life Elizabeth McGovern's family would be much more likely to be 'upstairs' dining with the Crawley’s than fellow actress Sophie McShera, who plays assistant cook Daisy Mason.

For the exquisitely turned-out Countess of Grantham whom she portrays, this would undoubtedly be music to her ears.

The American actress's great grandfather was Ethelbert Watts, a United States diplomat who played crucial roles in the Spanish-American War, Russo-Japanese War and World War One.

Continuing the tradition, her grandfather Ethelbert Watts Jr was a well-respected Naval Intelligence Officer in World War Two.

Meanwhile, her other great grandfather, Charles Jenkins Montgomery, is listed in the 1920 U.S. Census as a doctor.

Humbler heritage: In contrast, the family history Sophie McShera, who plays assistant cook Daisy Mason (above), shows that her ancestors would be more comfortable 'downstairs'

Just like the loveable Daisy, Sophie's great grandmother Annie Henderson Corsbie was employed as a cook, according to her marriage certificate (above)

Life imitating art: While Daisy marries World War One hero William Mason in the show, McShera's great grandfather Francis Henry Corsbie (right) also fought the Great War and was a member of the military police

Hero: A record card for one of three medals Francis Henry Corsbie won for bravery while serving with the Durham Light Infantry during World War One

In contrast, McShera's family history shows that her ancestors
 would probably be more comfortable 'downstairs'.

Just
 like the loveable Daisy, Sophie's great grandmother Annie Henderson 
Corsbie was employed as a cook and her great grandfather an electrician, according to their marriage certificate.

And while Daisy marries World War One
 hero William Mason in the show, McShera's second great grandfather 
Francis Henry Corsbie was a member of the Durham Light Infantry who won 
three campaign medals for his own bravery during the Great War.

Classy lineage: Hugh Bonneville – the man behind Lord Grantham - also has noble heritage running in his blood

Noble roots: Bonneville's fourth great grandfather was listed on his son's marriage record as a 'gentleman' living in Pembrokeshire, Wales

In a further case of life imitating art,
 Lily James – who plays Lady Rose McClare - should perhaps be familiar with 
ordering servants around given that her second great grandfather was a 
U.S. lawyer and her third great grandmother was a wealthy landowner, 
both of whom had servants.

For
 Hugh Bonneville – the man behind Lord Grantham - it seems the noble 
lifestyle runs in his blood, too.

His fourth great grandfather was 
listed on his son's marriage record as a 'gentleman' living in 
Pembrokeshire, Wales.

Proud history: Coyle's great uncle was the legendary Manchester United manager Sir Matt Busby (above)

Another actor with links to his 
character is Brendan Coyle - who portrays John Bates as one of the 
'downstairs' staff at Downton Abbey who served in the Boer war.

Coyle's own great grandfather Alexander Busby served and was killed in action in World War One in 1917.

Coyle is also the great nephew of legendary Manchester United manager Sir Matt Busby.

Adrian Leighton, spokesman for Ancestry.co.uk, said: 'The relationship between upstairs and downstairs has kept fans drawn to the show for four series.

'Our extensive collection of historic records means that anybody can now get online and find where their own relatives would have placed in Downton Abbey.'
