Dentist Joyce Trail, 51, who was jailed for conning the NHS out of nearly £1.4million, must pay it all back, a judge has ruled

A dentist jailed after she made more than £1million by fraudulently claiming for dental work on the NHS has been ordered to pay the whole lot back by a judge.

Joyce Trail, 51, from Sutton Coldfield, had submitted 100 claims for patients who were dead, and triple-claimed for others during a scam netting her £1,376,423.80 from 7,141 fraudulent claims.

She then splashed out on designer shoes and clothes, luxury homes, £1,000-a-night hotel suites in the Caribbean and America, and private schooling for her granddaughters.

Now, however, the conwoman has been told she must pay the proceeds of what was one of the biggest frauds in the history of the NHS back.

Trail, who was jailed for six and a half years in October 2012, must start her repayments to the NHS by handing over £358,281.87 within 18 months to the NHS.

At a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Warwick Crown Court yesterday, Judge Peter Carr made a compensation order for £1,376,423.80, meaning any assets Trail has now or in the future may be seized by the NHS.

And he ordered that she repay £358,281.87 of it within 18 months.

Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC told the court that the money was to be paid 'as part of a compensation order to the NHS who were the losers to the tune of just under £1.37million.'

Sue Frith, head of the National Investigation Service at NHS Protect, said after the case: 'This is the sort of outcome the public wish to see. We will always seek to recover lost NHS funds.

'NHS Protect and other agencies will do all we can to recoup as much of the loss as possible so it can be spent properly, on caring for NHS patients'.

During her trial at Birmingham Crown Court, it emerged that Trail, from Little Aston in the West Midlands, submitted more than 7,000 claims for work on patients she had not treated over a three-year period from March 2006.

Life of luxury: The dentist conwoman had to swap her spacious house in the West Midlands for a jail cell

Practice: Trail, who is a grandmother, worked out of Medical Spa Studios in Handsworth, Birmingham

Ill-gotten gains: Trail spent the money she swindled on vast amounts of designer shoes and clothes

She claimed for providing and fitting dentures for patients who were not entitled to have NHS treatment paid for, as well as those who didn't need dentures and those who were dead.

During the trial, the court heard how Trail, who worked out of Medical Spa studios in Handsworth, Birmingham, had a taste for expensive holidays and Jimmy Choo shoes, and used the money she had fraudulently gleaned to lead a lavish lifestyle.

The judge told the jury that the dentist's collection of expensive Jimmy Choos 'would make Imelda Marcos proud', and said that Trail acted 'out of pure greed'.

The case was described as one of the most complex taken on by West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service.

Last October, Trail was struck off by the General Dental Council and is set to lose her NHS pension.

A spokesman said: 'The gravity of Trail’s convictions offended fundamental standards of behaviour expected of a member of the dental profession.

'Her convictions go to her character and her actions are incapable of remedy. She has brought the profession into disrepute and remains subject to the lengthy custodial sentences imposed upon her by the court.'
