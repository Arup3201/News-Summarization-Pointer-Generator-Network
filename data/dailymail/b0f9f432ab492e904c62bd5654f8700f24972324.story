The proud owner of Diddly Squat: The Top Gear presenter has been granted permission to bulldoze the farmhouse to make way for his dream luxury home

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has granted permission to bulldoze a five-bedroom farmhouse in the Cotswolds.

The 53-year-old had plans to demolish the property which is set within a 70-hectare plate approved, and intends to replace it with a larger house complete with a swimming pool and tennis court.

According to West Oxfordshire District Council paperwork, the star plans to name his new home Diddly Squat Farm.

Local authority planning officers granted the application under their delegated powers after no objections were received during the consultation period.

A number of conditions have been attached to the consent, including that the building work is started within the next three years.

Moving to the site from his present home in Oldner, near Chipping Norton, Oxon, would take Mr Clarkson several miles closer to his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron, who lives in the nearby village of Dean.

The luxury home will also boast its own orchard and croquet lawn, as well as renovating a derelict barn to feature a snooker room and two more bedrooms.

The new property will boast plenty of space for animals with existing stables in place and plans for a kennel and dog. 

Designed by landscape architects Portus+Whitton, the plans also feature a gravelled courtyard and five on-site car parking spaces for Mr Clarkson's fleet of luxury vehicles.

Mr Clarkson bought the farmhouse in Chipping Norton in 2009 with plans to own quad bikes and grow his own food

His plans for the property include a six-bedroom main house complete with swimming pool, orchard, croquet lawn and tennis court as well as a renovated barn

An advertisement on property website Rightmove.com which has been taken down by the agent invited offers in excess of £4.25m pounds for the freehold on the farm and the land.

The advert encouragerd prospective buyers to'fulfil the dream' and also notes there is the possibility to create a 'sensational party barn' in the 312-acre plot, which it states was available in its entirety or in four separate lots.

In an blog post written on the Top Gear website in early 2009, Mr Clarkson said he had bought a farm in Chipping Norton and planned to whizz around on quad bikes with his children.

'I have bought a farm. There are many sensible reasons for this,' he wrote.

'Land is a better investment than any bank can offer. The government doesn't get any of my money when I die. And the price of the food that I grow can only go up.

'But there is another, much more important reason: I can now have a quad bike.

'I have always loved the idea of such things. They are like motorbikes but they don't fall over when you leave them alone, they look great and they bring a bit of civilisation to Britain's rather dreary green and brown bits.'
