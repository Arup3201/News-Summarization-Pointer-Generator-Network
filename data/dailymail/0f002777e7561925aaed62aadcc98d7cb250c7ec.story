Lord Lucan’s brother has told the BBC that the fugitive aristocrat died in 2004 and is buried in Africa.

Hugh Bingham is said to have made the startling disclosure in an ‘unguarded moment’ after an interview at his Johannesburg home.

When the cameras stopped rolling, he was pressed by a journalist on the Inside Out programme about whether Lucan – accused of murdering his children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett, in 1974 – was ‘dead or alive’.

Twist: The startling revelation was revealed by Sandra Rivett's son Neil Berriman

Mr Bingham, 72, replied: ‘I know  for a fact  my brother died in 2004 and that his grave is in Africa.’

The alleged admission – which would 
mean Lucan was 70 when he died – was revealed by Mrs Rivett’s 
46-year-old son, Neil Berriman.

He took part in the same programme 
and has remained in close contact with reporter Glenn Campbell, who 
interviewed Mr Bingham. Mr Berriman, from Liphook, Hampshire, said 
yesterday: ‘The BBC and Glenn Campbell have since been desperate to find
the grave and make another documentary.’

Only two minutes of the 90-minute 
interview were broadcast last  December. It is largely unremarkable, 
with Mr Bingham repeating his previously aired view that his brother 
escaped after Mrs Rivett, 29, was bludgeoned to death at the peer’s 
London home.

Resources: Detectives thought Lord Lucan, left, fled abroad helped by his powerful friends including billionaire Sir James Goldsmith after the murder of Sandra Rivett, right,

‘I believe my brother was innocent 
but I don’t believe he would commit suicide,’ he said. ‘He was a man of 
considerable resourcefulness, so I imagine he used those resources to 
remove  himself from the picture.’

But Mr Bingham’s subsequent claim is likely to be seized on by detectives. Police said they were unaware of it last night.

The Mail on Sunday has been shown a 
2002 police report that details the  evidence against the Earl and 
outlines Scotland Yard’s strategy. It reveals that officers looked into 
sightings of Lucan in Mozambique, where he was said to be living under 
an assumed name.

The report says: ‘Recent developments
have included alleged sightings of Lucan in Africa. Enquiries have 
yielded photographs of a  person who is the subject of these reported 
sightings.

‘With a little imagination, these 
photos are sufficiently close to Lucan’s possible appearance to warrant 
submission to a facial imaging expert.’

It adds that the man was living on an estate containing a ranch and several small holiday chalets.

‘Locals refer to this complex as Lord
Lucan’s house. Should enquiries be desirable in Mozambique or South 
Africa, a potential source (a recent former London Met police officer), 
who is familiar with the locale, is available for low-level intelligence
gathering.’

It is believed that Lucan, a 
professional gambler, mistook Mrs Rivett for his wife Veronica, from 
whom he was estranged, and hit her with lead piping. Lady Lucan was also
attacked but managed to escape.

Lord Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect his children, and then drove to a friend’s house in East Sussex.

He left hours later and was never 
seen again. Detectives have long thought the 7th Earl fled abroad helped
by his powerful friends, including billionaire Sir James Goldsmith.

Despite sightings across the world, 
most detectives who worked on the case believe Africa would have given 
the peer the best opportunity of living anonymously.

Although Mr Bingham dismissed the 
Mozambique sightings, he has said in a previous interview he was ‘sure’ 
his brother fled to Africa. Last night, he said he did not wish to speak
about his brother.

The BBC declined to comment.
