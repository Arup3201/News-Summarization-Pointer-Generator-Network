on her.

princess - and fourth in line to the Swedish throne - got her happy 
ending in the Royal Palace today, watched by a glittering congregation.

Madeleine's
 showstopping wedding gown - made from silk organdies with applications 
of ivory Chantilly lace - was created by master couturier Valentino.

Small vertical pleats at the waist opened into a full skirt with a flowing, four-metre train.

The
 princess' six-metre long cathedral veil was also made from silk 
organdies, edged with tulle and embellished with Chantilly lace flowers.

Madeleine wore her hair swept back from her face in a simple yet elegant style.

The low bun was held in place by her royal tiara, which was decorated with a delicate garland of fresh orange blossoms.

The couple announced their engagement in October 2012.

Their wedding celebrations began last night with a private dinner at the Grand Hotel in Stockholm hosted by the king and queen.

Following today's ceremony a reception will be held at Stockholm's Drottningholm Palace, the royal family's private residence.

The princess, who is also known as the Duchess of Halsingland and Gastrikland, is the fourth in line to the Swedish throne.

She lives in New York where she works for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her mother.

Mr O'Neill will not hold a title after the wedding as he has elected to remain a private citizen and not be granted royal rank.

Madeleine became known as Sweden's party princess during her early 20s, when she was frequently spotted at Stockholm's high-end nightclubs.

Countless column inches were also devoted to Madeleine's stylish wardrobe and glamorous lifestyle.
