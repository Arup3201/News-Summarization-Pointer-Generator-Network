Shop closures are turning high streets into ‘ghost towns’ with clothes shops, building societies and mobile phone stores most likely to put up their shutters.

Stores closed at the rate of 16 a day, a total of 3,003, across 500 main shopping centres during the first six months of this year, a study found.

At the same time there has been a fall in new tenants filling the gaps, so many outlets remain empty – and a magnet for vandals.

The changes are being driven by a switch to buying on the internet, with British families spending more online per person than in any other nation.

High street stores are closing at an alarming rate as shoppers spurn them for retail parks and the internet

A survey by business services and accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers found a net fall of 406 shops across 500 town centres in the first six months of this year – compared with 209 in the same period in 2013.

Net closures – the number of stores shut, minus the number of new shops opened – rise to 964 when data for July to September is added, following the collapse of Phones4u and La Senza. That is 260 per cent higher than the net closure figure for the whole of last year.

The findings suggest many traditional shops, such as fashion outlets, travel agents and building societies are disappearing, while the big chains are moving from town centres to retail parks.

They also make clear that government efforts to revive the high street, including a review by the ‘Queen of Shops’ Mary Portas, have failed to end the rise of ‘ghost towns’. PwC said the biggest decline was in fashion shops, with a net closure of 146. Some 20 per cent of clothes and shoe purchases are now made online.

There was a net fall of 96 building society branches, largely due to people using the internet and phone services to manage their finances.

Mobile phone shops saw a net fall of 47 even before the collapse of Phones4u, and the number of pawnbrokers dropped by 48. But some retail outlets are growing in number, including betting shops, coffee shops, pound stores, charity shops and supermarket convenience branches.

PwC’s Mark Hudson said: ‘This data shows that we are now really starting to see the full effects of the digital revolution… Although the rate of growth of online sales is slowing, it still far outstrips store sales growth for most retailers… 

This, combined with the advances in mobile technologies and smartphones, is only going to accelerate the channel shift.’

The figures point to a regional divide, with closures most likely in the East Midlands and North West. By contrast, high streets in London and the East of England were still relatively buoyant.

A separate survey by analysts Experian revealed a move away from traditional shops towards leisure and food. It found tattoo parlours have surged by 173 per cent over the past decade, while the number of takeaway outlets is up 54 per cent.

Experian’s Richard Jenkings said the high street has ‘clearly become a more social environment’.

He added: ‘We have seen a clear expansion in the number of retailers where the customer actually needs to be there in person to enjoy the experience, such as cafes, health clubs and even tattooists.’
