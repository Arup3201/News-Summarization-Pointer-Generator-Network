Sophie McGarry is accused of stealing gold jewellery and cash from patients

A nurse has appeared in court accused of stealing gold jewellery and cash from patients.

Healthcare assistant Sophie McGarry, 21, faces claims she took items including a gold Krugerrand coin, a chain and bracelet from patients at the hospital over a seven-month period.

She was flanked by her parents at the hearing in Scarborough, North Yorkshire in which the prosecution claimed she stole several thousand pounds worth of goods from patients at Scarborough Hospital.

The nurse will now appear at York Crown Court next month over the accusations.

The charges relate to allegations of theft across the Graham, Chestnut and the Ann Wright wards, as well as the Stroke Unit.

In total, she faces 13 counts of theft by finding, along with a further charge of theft.

McGarry, of Scarborough, who entered no plea ,appeared alongside Liam Andrews, of Burnley, Lancashire who is alleged to have handled the £1,100 bracelet the Crown Prosecution Service claim the nurse stole.

Andrews, 24, entered a not guilty plea to his sole charge of handling stolen goods.

The nurse was first arrested in November 2013 then bailed, before she was arrested again as subsequent charges came to light.

She is currently suspended from her role at Scarborough Hospital pending both the outcome of the court case, and an internal NHS probe.

Since the allegations came to light, the York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has sought to reassure patients, claiming that their safety is its 'top priority'.

A trust spokesperson added: 'We would like to reassure patients and staff that creating a safe environment remains our top priority.

'We are unable to comment further until after the court hearing.'
