Francois Hollande speaks to his new girlfriend, Julie Gayet, only via text message for fear their private life may fall under the global spotlight once again, it has been claimed.

The French president was plunged into an unprecedented sex scandal after he dumped his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, for the 41-year-old actress last year.

But thanks to a relentless campaign of media scrutiny since news of the scandal broke, the couple have been forced to live separate lives, never meeting in person and communicating only via SMS, gossip magazine Paris Match reported.

Despite their difficulties in maintaining a normal relationship, however, friends were last night keen to stress the couple's romance is as strong as ever.

News of their affair dominated front pages across the world after gossip magazine Closer published pictures of Hollande hopping off the back of a scooter, his head clad in a large black helmet, for an apparent rendezvous

'It's big love even if they are 
discreet,' an unnamed friend told Paris Match, the weekly magazine.

News of their affair dominated front pages across the world after gossip magazine Closer published pictures of Hollande hopping off the back of a scooter, his head clad in a large black helmet, for an apparent rendezvous at an apartment near the presidential palace.

Now Gayet is relying on France's notoriously strict privacy laws to sue Closer for 54,000 euros over the pictures, which she says have devastated her professional and personal life and violated 'the most intimate side of her privacy'.

Appearing at a court in Nanterre without his client, Ms Gayet's lawyer, Maitre Jean Enocchi, said she had 'suffered and still suffers on a daily 
basis', describing her as a discreet and 
private woman who enjoyed film festivals and going out with Tadeo, 14, 
and Ezechiel, 13, her children from her former marriage to Santiago 
Amigorena, the Argentine director.

He said she has become a prisoner in her own apartment which lies under siege by an army of paparazzi.

'The first time she went out, she was attacked by a veritable hoard of photographers who followed her to the chemists and to the supermarket, gluing themselves to the supermarket window when she was inside,' he said.

He said the money she sought, though high by French standards, was 'well below the harm she has suffered'.

She is seeking 54,000 euros (£44,500) in damages and legal fees from the celebrity gossip glossy, plus front-page publication of a summary of any judicial ruling in the case.

Damages: It comes as Hollande's estranged partner Ms Trierweiler, 48, won 12,000 euros (£9,800) from magazine Closer after it ran pictures of her on holiday in Mauritius in February

Closer's January revelation that Hollande was meeting secretly with Gayet led to his public separation from his long-time companion, Ms Trierweiler, and drew international headlines.

Hollande never denied his relationship with Gayet, who has appeared in public only a handful of times since the report.

Laurence Pieau, the editor of Closer, has defended the publication of the photos of Gayet and Persident Hollande saying it was something the public had a right to know.

Secrecy: François Mitterrand, the last Socialist president, kept a 'secret family' at the taxpayers¿ expense without it being revealed until he was about to retire in 1995

France
 has some of the strictest privacy laws in the world – but they are 
increasingly being flouted by a media trying to expose hypocrisy and 
corruption in public life.

At present it is an offence to publish information about a person’s private life without their express permission.

The
 love triangle between President Hollande, first lady Valerie 
Trierweiler and actress Julie Gayet has been known about for around a 
year. Miss Trierweiler is herself a journalist on the notoriously 
intrusive glossy magazine Paris Match.

Yet
 reporters have been scared to expose an affair which could have such 
widespread ramifications. Instead it has been left to French Closer, a 
rival of Paris Match owned by an Italian company, to test the privacy 
laws to their limit.

Closer frequently risks relatively modest fines and legal costs by publishing risque photographs.Mr Hollande’s immediate predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac, all cheated on  their wives.

mistress and daughter at the taxpayers’ expense without it being 
revealed until he was about to retire in 1995.
