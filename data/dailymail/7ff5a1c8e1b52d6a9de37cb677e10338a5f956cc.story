Tragic: Former policeman Paul Charles, 53, who drove over a cliff with his wife Jacqueline, 48, in an apparent suicide pact

A former policeman and his estranged wife killed themselves by driving their car off a cliff in a dramatic suicide pact, an inquest heard today.

Paul Charles, 53, and his wife Jacqueline, 48, crashed their Renault Scenic through a fence before it plummeted down the 200ft cliff to the beach below on the Isle of Wight.

The couple left behind matching suicide notes before taking their own lives at Culver Cliffs at Culver Down, Sandown, on the island.

Astrologer David Mallard had been out walking in the area when he saw the Charles' car crash through the fence in front of him.

'As the car went over I was slightly 
stunned for a few seconds and in reality if it was not for the fact that
the fence was down I would have thought I was dreaming,' he told the 
inquest at Isle of Wight Coroners' Court, sitting in Newport.

Mr Mallard said that the car had driven 'expertly' over the bumpy downs on the evening of August 17 last year.

'There was absolutely nothing from inside the car, I didn't see anyone saying "let me out", I heard nothing.'

Mr
Charles, a former Metropolitan Police Officer, and his wife had both 
been unhappy in the weeks before their death, Coroner John Matthews 
heard.

The hearing was told they had a last 
supper at the Culver Haven Inn of bacon and mozzarella and bacon and 
sausage baguettes with a pint of Foster's lager and a glass of Pinot 
Grigio wine.

Bar manager Leslie Dyke said: 'They were there for about two hours. At one point they went out for a cigarette.

'They didn't appear to be intoxicated or arguing, they didn't stand out.'

Mr Dyke added that several weeks 
before a couple had come to the pub and talked to him about driving off 
the cliff but he couldn't confirm it was the same people.

Double death: The couple were killed after crashing through a fence at the top of Culver Cliffs at Culver Down, Sandown. The car came to a rest at the bottom of the cliff

Local resident Edward Lyon, who later 
saw the car drive off the cliff, said: 'I saw the blue car suddenly 
crossing the grass and going down the bank.

'I thought it was going about 30 to 40mph. The car maintained a constant speed 
up to the fence, went straight through the fence and went out of sight 
and unfortunately towards the sea.

'I was totally shocked to see it heading towards the cliff. It was gone in a matter of seconds.'

Det Sgt Clare Crane, of Hampshire and 
Isle of Wight police, said that a suicide note was found in the wallet 
of Mr Charles, from Sandown, as well as another at the home of Mrs 
Charles, in Ryde.

DS Crane explained that Mrs Charles had previously talked to friends about a suicide pact with her estranged husband.

She said the couple had a volatile relationship and had more recently lived apart.

DS Crane told the hearing that Mrs Charles had said: 'Paul had started to apply pressure to her to go along with the suicide.

'Paul was still planning to take his own life, he had asked her to go to Culver Down to say goodbye.

'She said she had no intention to commit suicide whatsoever, she said she had too much to live for.'

She added that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the two deaths and the police considered that they had both committed suicide.

The case continues tomorrow.

Retired Mr Charles, aged 53, of Sandown, Isle of
Wight, and wife Jacqueline, aged 48, of Ryde, Isle of Wight, had both 
been married before
