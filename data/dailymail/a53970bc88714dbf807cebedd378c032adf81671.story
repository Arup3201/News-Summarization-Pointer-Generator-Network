An investigation has been launched after two patients died just days after a hospital's water supply was deemed unsafe. 

Police are investigating the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham after its water was found to contain 16 times the safe levels of chlorine.

Two patients died after receiving dialysis treatment from machines which had used the contaminated water, and the Coroner's office is investigating whether it could have played a role in their deaths.

The Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham is the second largest hospital in the country and cost £545 million to build.

An investigation has been launched after two patients died just days after the water supply at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham was deemed unsafe

It's a state of the art hospital - the second largest in the country – with 30 operating theatres.

But since August 4 there have been three occasions when levels of chlorine in the water system have risen to unsafe levels.

Staff and patients were instead given bottled water and warned not to drink from taps.

On August 7, an email sent to staff warned the water supply was contaminated.

It said: 'Estates have been testing chlorination equipment at the Trust and have corrected the fault that caused higher than acceptable levels of chlorine to enter the drinking water. 

'Water across all areas of the Trust has been tested, and it is safe to drink.'

On the August 11 and 12, two patients in critical care died.

The hospital said the deaths were referred to the Coroner's office because of the 'possibility of a connection' with 'the chlorine occurrence'.

The day after the second death, high chlorine levels were detected in water in the radiotherapy department.

Two further emails were sent asking nursing staff in one part of the hospital to 'flush all toilets, macerators... and all taps both hot and cold... for at least five minutes each time'.

This needed to be done 'each day in the morning and late afternoon, until further notice'.

The Coroner's office informed the police, who launched an investigation into the deaths. A spokeswoman for University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust confirmed to MailOnline that an internal investigation had been launched as soon as problems with the water supply came to light 

The Coroner's office informed the police, who launched an investigation into the deaths.

In a statement, West Midlands Police said that investigations are ongoing.

A spokeswoman for University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust confirmed to MailOnline that an internal investigation had been launched as soon as problems with the water supply came to light.

She said: 'A review of all chlorine systems has been completed and the implementation of any necessary works is being carried out.

'We have enforced additional safety measures which include 30-minute monitoring, 24 hours a day, with four-hourly reporting back to the trust on chlorine levels across the hospital.

'There are twice weekly meetings between the trust and contractors.'

They added 'no patients or staff were adversely affected'.

Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham was funded by the controversial Private Finance Initiative (PFI) introduced by the last Labour government.

This was a way of drumming up funds for projects like schools and hospitals where private companies were asked to complete and manage public projects.

The hospital, which has 6,500 staff and 1,200 beds is run by private firm Balfour Beatty.

Officials have voiced concerns that companies managing public services managed under PFI schemes are not incentivised to report problems as it would cost them money.
