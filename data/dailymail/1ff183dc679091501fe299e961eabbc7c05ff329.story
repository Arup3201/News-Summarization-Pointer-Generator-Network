Before Dzhokar Tsarnaev made his final stand following the Boston Marathon bombings last year, the 19-year-old sent his mother one final email to tell her that he loved her.

The message ended with: 'Inshallah (God willing) if I don't see you in this life I will see you in the akhira (the Islamic afterlife).'

Prosecutors say the message is proof that the terrorism suspect did not intend to survive the violent crime spree that left his brother Tamerlan and an MIT police officer dead three days after the attacks.

Dzhokar was captured in the evening of April 19 after he was found hiding in a boat docked on dry land in Watertown, Massachusetts, following a manhunt that locked down all of greater Boston.

Saying goodbye: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sent a final email to his mother before his May 18 rampage in Boston that left his brother dead

The terror suspect told his mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva: 'I'll see you in the afterlife'

The revelation about the suspect's final email came out today in a court filing by prosecutors, who are fighting a motion from the defense team to throw out the evidence collected from his dorm room at the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth. 

Dzhokar's attorneys say the search was illegal because it was conducted without a warrant.

However, prosecutors argue that Dzhokar had no expectation of privacy in part because he abandoned his dorm room and didn't expect to survive after he and his brother went on the run.

The email contributes to this argument, they say.

Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, Dzhokar's mother, is living in Russia after she fled the US to avoid prosecution following a shoplifting arrest.

Friends and neighbors said she became increasingly radicalized in her Islamic beliefs during her time in the United States.

She continues to defend her sons in public interviews, claiming that they were framed by the FBI. 

Dzhokar faces numerous federal terrorism and murder charges and could face the death penalty if convicted.
