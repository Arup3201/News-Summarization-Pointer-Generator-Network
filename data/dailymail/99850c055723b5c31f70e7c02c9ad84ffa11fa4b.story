Three climbers have become the first in the world to conquer the Shark's Fin - a lethal 20,000ft pinnacle.

The daredevil trio of Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk spent 12 days scaling up the jagged near vertical point on Meru Central in the Himalayas.

Dubbed one of the hardest climbs in the world, dozens of professional climbers had previously been defeated by the tricky summit - with one breaking both legs during an attempt.

But the American climbers successfully negotiated the 20,700ft climb - sleeping in a hanging tent thousands of feet above the ground.

Photographer and climber Jimmy Chin captured the expedition, and said: 'We had tried to climb this direct route before but were forced to turn back.

'I remember saying at the time that maybe the Sharks Fin wasn't meant to be climbed and decided I wasn't coming back.

Determined: Mr Anker had attempted to climb the notorious route twice before - in 2003 and 2008 - and came within 150 metres of the summit during his second go

'But after another team attempted it, we were all hoping they would get it done.

'It
started to dawn on me that, if they didn't manage it, then I'll go back
and try it. Conrad and I started talking a little bit about it again.

'It's such an iconic, legendary route - nobody's been able to do it.

Champions of the world: The three have gone down in the record books as the first to ascend directly straight up the distinctive fin shaped summit, rather than either side

'We got so close in 2008 and having that knowledge of the route, knowing all the little things we would've done differently, it's hard not to go back and throw everything at it again.'

Anker had attempted to climb the notorious route twice before - in 2003 and 2008 - and came within 150 metres of the summit during his second go.

And battling temperatures plummeting to minus 20 degrees Celsius during the DAY, he finally conquered the legendary route.

It means that the three have gone down in the record books as the first to ascend directly straight up the distinctive fin shaped summit, rather than either side.
