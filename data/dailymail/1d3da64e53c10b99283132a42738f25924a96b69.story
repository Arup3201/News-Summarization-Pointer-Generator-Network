Most excitable young pups wouldn't wait for an invite before making themselves at home on a patch of luscious green grass.

But when these nine beagles were given free rein in a beautiful garden, they had no idea what to with themselves.

These adorably young pups had spent their entire lives locked away in in the confines of a laboratory in Nevada, where they were 
heartlessly used as test subjects - and never once allowed to run around
 or play.

Nine beagle puppies used for laboratory testing tread precariously onto the grass as they are released into the open for the first time in Las Vegas, America

But just this week, the beagles were released from their cages into the outside world - and felt the grass beneath their paws for the first time.

In an amazing video which recorded the moment, volunteers from the Beagle Freedom Project are seen carefully releasing the puppies into the Las Vegas garden - where they are given their very first taste of freedom.

With no experience of the outside world, the dogs are seen tentatively making their way across the grass, dazzled by their new surroundings.

The footage shows four of the puppies looking so scared that they even start looking
 for a spot to hide.

The puppies are seen cowering behind bushes, trees and even an old wooden pen.

But the footage, filmed in a garden in Las Vegas, shows the puppies slowly starting to embrace their new-found freedom.

One of the beagles strides excitedly through the grass after he is released from the laboratory in Nevada for the first time by volunteers from the Beagle Freedom Project

The puppies, who have had no contact with the outside world since they were born, jumped up to greet one another as they ran around the garden

Within minutes, the dogs have come together in solidarity, frantically wagging their tails as they jump up to greet one another.

The incredible footage also shows one of the volunteers giving names to the dogs for the first time.

Previously know by just a number, the hounds were named after members of the Rat Pack and other entertainers, including Frankie, Dean, Sammy and Joey.Â

After spending some time in the garden, the beagles started tucking into bowls of water and food under the guidance of the volunteers

Dean - named after Dean Martin - is the first to be released, apprehensively looking around him as the volunteer places him onto the grass.

Meanwhile inquisitive Sammy - named after Sammy Davis Junior - snuck under the pool fence so he could take a quick dip in the pool.

The Beagle Freedom Project works to rescue beagles from being confined in laboratory cages and living the lives of test subjects.
