Often, the hardest part of returning from a trip is deciding which moments are worth sharing.

This wasn’t a problem for innovative documentarian Alex Chacón, 26, who managed to condense 600 days of travel into under three minutes worth of video.

From Alaska to Argentina, the professional traveller's trusty camera managed to capture all the places he visited - 36 countries in total.

Not your average travel snaps: Avid motorcyclist and professional traveller Alex Chacón has found an interesting way to keep people interested in his travels

The avid motorcyclist, born in Texas but raised between the US and Mexico, travelled around the world on his bike, managing to visit 36 countries in 600 days.

Wanting a unique way to showcase the people he met and places he visited, Alex attached a GoPro camera to a selfie tripod.

In the process, he managed to capture himself motorcycling, mountain climbing, mud bathing and much more.

While he told his fellow travellers, or co-stars, that he was documenting the trip - he was not able to tell when it would be released.

Almost like tug-of-war: Alex can be seen holding the selfie tripod in most of the vignettes that were merged and became his three year epic selfie

For some, they’ve been ‘very excited to find themselves’, Alex told MailOnline.

For others, it was 'kind of a surprise when they showed up' – especially given the short film’s growing popularity.

When asked where his favourite location visited was, he wasn’t able to decide.

'That's like having seven children and deciding which one you love the most'

But that doesn’t mean he’s not keeping a list of his favourite places – he just can’t narrow it down to one.

Oh, the Places You'll Go: Alex was keen to showcase the people he met on his trip, just as much as the locations he visited

Alex's three favourite destinations so far have been Alaska, Bolivia and Brazil.

After spending fourteen days camping in Alaska, trying to catch the famed Northern Lights, he finally did - on his birthday.

'It inspired and fulfilled me with positive energy to continue travelling,' he says

Another experience he cherishes is visiting the largest waterfall in Brazil.

'The force of power,' helped him to see 'the world and the actual wonders in a very nice way.'

Making friends: Alex advised all of the people filmed with him in the video that he was working on the project and some got quite the surprise when they saw themselves in the finished product

The final of his inspiring destinations was the Uyuni Salt Flat in Bolivia.

'It completely altered my being in a positive way - it was a very nice spiritual journey.'

With the travel bug not yet out of his system, Alex has trips planned to Africa and possibly Australia.
