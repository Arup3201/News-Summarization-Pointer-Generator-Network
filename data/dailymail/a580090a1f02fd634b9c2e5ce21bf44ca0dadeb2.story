A man who cut off as much as 12 inches of his former girlfriend's hair has been ordered to shave his head for six months as punishment under a reciprocity law.

Virginia man Melvin D. Hunt, 61, has agreed to the terms and must take a razor to his scalp by December 1.

His attorney, Billy Shields, said that he didn't think there was anything terrible about the punishment.

'There are a lot of fellows that go around with no hair,' he told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 'It was part of the deal and my client will abide by it.'

Hunt is a former physical education coordinator for a private Chesterfield County school. 

He pleaded guilty in the September 12 attack on the unnamed former girlfriend.

The woman agreed to meet Hunt in Elizabeth Davis Middle School where she works as a physical education and health teacher.

He asked her for a hug, then once he was holding her pulled out a pair of scissors and sliced off the woman's ponytail. 

It wasn't until she saw the hair on the ground that she realized what he'd done.

Several of her fellow teachers have since cut their own hair in solidarity. 

Hunt has since resigned from his job at Riverside School.

He is also being forced to attend anger management.

'It's akin to the cases where someone steals something from a store or damages or defaces somebody’s property, (and the court requires) they wear a sandwich board out in front and say, ‘Here I am, I did these things and I’m sorry,’' Chesterfield prosecutor Larry Hogan said.

The victim has reportedly kept in touch with Hunt, who Hogan said was 'still very much in love with her.'

Hunt has been banned from Davis Elementary School.
