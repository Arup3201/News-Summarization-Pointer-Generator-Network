Jose Mourinho has confirmed that Diego Costa is fit to face Queens Park Rangers on Saturday.

The striker has not played since coming back from international duty with Spain struggling with persistent hamstring problems.

He has missed Chelsea's past four games, but the £32million summer signing is set to return against QPR.

'He is available,' confirmed Mourinho. 'That's good for us. It's difficult, when only one striker available. It is difficult. When you have two, obviously the situation improves. 

'We don't have Mikel, it's not good for us. He's always an option. But the fact we recover Ramires is a compensation for that loss. So the situation is a bit better.'

And Mourinho insisted that the striker would continue to be allowed to go on international duty, despite his injury problems. 

Mourinho has been rowing with Spain national team coach Vicente del Bosque in recent weeks. 

The Portuguese was not happy that Costa came back from international duty injured but del Bosque has hit back saying he will remain stubborn by playing the striker.

Mourinho, however, will not stand in his Costa's way of joining up with the Spain team in future.

He added: 'The only thing I can say is what everybody knows, which is the time he was having problems in Chelsea and the way we managed to keep him playing, but after the national team we lost him for four matches. Crystal Palace, Maribor, Shrewsbury and Man United. 

'Four matches in three different competitions. Now he's again available, but he needs obviously to be again under special care. We are going to do that. It's the only thing we can do, nothing else.'

Drogba's goal against Shrewsbury Town on Tuesday night was his third in three competitions last week

Costa's return is likely to mean a rest for Didier Drogba, who filled in for Costa in the summer signing's absence.

Drogba was the subject of continued praise from his manager, after scoring in three consecutive games. 

Mourinho said the Ivorian striker had demonstrated that he 'can show his importance by being there when the team need him'.

And with Loic Remy still missing until after the next international break, Drogba will almost certainly still have some part to play.
