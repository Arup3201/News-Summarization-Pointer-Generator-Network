The family of brain dead Jahi McMath is receiving financial help from the Terri Schiavo foundation

The parents of Jahi McMath are receiving financial backing from a foundation started by another family famous for their battle to keep their child on life support.

The Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network has been working with relatives of the 13-year-old California girl, who was declared brain-dead after tonsil surgery, to get her moved to a care facility.

Jahi McMath suffered complications after having her tonsils removed, causing her heart to stop and massive brain damage that the hospital say is so severe that she is effectively dead.

The case of Terri Schiavo became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s when her husband attempted to remove her feeding tube against the wishes of her parents.

Terri Schiavo had suffered a heart attack in 1990 after which her husband cared for her, until 1998 when he filed a petition to have her feeding tube removed.

Michael Schiavo claimed that it was his wife's wish to 'pull the plug', and after several years fighting her family in court, Terri's feeding tube was removed in 2005.

Terri Schiavo's parents set up the foundation in 2001 to fight for Terri's case and now the organisation is devoted to helping families of incapacitated patients facing a loss of life support.

Jahi underwent a tonsillectomy at Children's Hospital Oakland last month to treat sleep apnea.

Her mother Nailah Winkfield, believes her daughter can recover and is fighting plans to turn off her ventilator,

On New Years Eve, the family won a last-minute injunction to keep Jahi alive until January 7.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said watching her daughter suffering will haunt her forever.

'My daughter started to bleed and that will scar me forever because it happened in front of my face, in front of my mother’s face, in front of my husband’s face,' she said on a break in the grounds of Children’s Hospital, Oakland, California.

'She was very scared. She knew something was wrong. To see your daughter like that is just heartbreaking.

'But I still have hope. In fact I have 
more than hope. I am positive my daughter is going to wake up. I don’t 
have a doubt. I talk to her about it all the time.'

Mrs Winkworth, 34, a Home Depot worker, was comforted by her husband Marvin, 33, a truck driver, as she sat on the wall outside the hospital which she has not left since December 9th when the complications occurred.

'I never knew I would have to fight a hospital to treat my daughter,' she said.

'I find it unbelievable.  I have not been home since December 9th, I have been sleeping in the waiting room. I cannot leave Jahi.'

She said that the way the hospital has treated her daughter and the family has been 'disgusting'.

'The way the hospital has behaved towards me is outrageous. It is disrespectful. It is disgusting.

'They don’t even refer to her by name. They refer to her as the deceased, or the body, or the dead and my daughter is not dead.

'They are awful, they have no compassion.'

Backing: Terri Schaivo was at the center of a right-to-life debate that captivated the United States for several years in the late 90s and early 2000s, and a foundation set up in her name is supporting Jahi's family

Mrs
 Winkfield, who has three other children, said all she wanted to do was 
get her daughter away from the hospital to a place that cared for her.

'The doctors here pretty much want my daughter gone', she said.

'I want the same thing but I want her out of here alive, they want her out of here dead.

'I
 blame the hospital for what happened. They should say ‘hey let’s do 
what’s right for this little girl, we messed her up,  we owe her, the 
least we can do is let her get out of here’.'

She said she feels a mixture of anger, sadness and guilt.

'I feel angry at the hospital,' she said.

'Sad for my daughter and guilty because I made her have the operation.

'She
 told me not to make her have the operation. She was scared. She said 
her worst fear was never waking up, that’s what she told me. That is why
 I feel guilty.

'I just wished I had picked a different hospital. When I first heard things had gone wrong,  I passed out from shock.'

Tragedy: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally 
brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal that dosctors 
suggested as a means of eliminating her sleep apnea

She said she was puzzled why the hospital was blocking the family’s bid to move Jahi.

'I
 think they are trying to cover up something and I think they would 
rather she dies than I prove them wrong that she is alive,' she said.

One
 of the issues is that the hospital is refusing to fit a feeding tube 
to the patient as they say they don’t operate on dead people.

The operation must be carried out before a care facility can take her in.

'I
 don’t believe what the hospital are saying,' said Mrs Winkfield, adding
 that she believes her daughter is not getting the best treatment as she
 is not an organ donor.

I just have to keep faith. I just want to get her away from here. They don’t want her here.

'That’s why they are not feeding her, that’s why they don’t refer to her by her name. That’s why they call her the deceased.'

Sam Singer, the spokesman for the 
hospital, said that the family’s lawyer Chris Dolan was cruelly 
perpetuating the 'hoax' that Jahi was still alive.

He said it was a terribly sad case but that three doctors and the courts had agreed that there was no hope for the girl.

Although
 Jahi's family is receiving support from the Terri Schiavo foundation, 
Children's Hospital spokesman Melinda Krigel says it has not heard 
from any facility.
