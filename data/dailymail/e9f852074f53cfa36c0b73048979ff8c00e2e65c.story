Manchester United and Liverpool target £25million Memphis Depay has held talks with Paris St Germain this week with the permission of his club PSV Eindhoven.

The dialogue between PSG and Depay represents a threat to the Premier League clubs with the Qatari-backed French club understood to have made a significantly better financial offer than Liverpool.

United have yet to hold detailed talks with the player but have informed PSV of their wish to do so while Liverpool have established a good relationship with the club and would be serious contenders to sign the wide player if United's offer does not match their own.

Louis van Gaal gave Depay his international debut but could miss out on bringing him to Old Trafford 

However, Depay is intrigued by the prospect of playing with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and is good friends with Gregory van der Wiel, his team-mate in the Holland national team, who is also at PSG.

With Bayern Munich also considering a move for the winger, a move to the Premier League is in the balance though if United firm up their interest, they clearly have an advantage.

Louis van Gaal gave Depay his international debut for Holland and the player also worked under van Gaal's assistant, Albert Stuivenberg in the Holland Under-17 team which won the 2011 European Championships.
