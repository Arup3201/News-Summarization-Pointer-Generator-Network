Australian novelist Richard Flanagan holds a copy of his book 'The Narrow Road to the Deep North' as he poses as winner of the 2014 Man Booker Prize

An Australian writer has won this year’s Man Booker Prize with a novel inspired by his father’s experiences as a Japanese prisoner of war.

Richard Flanagan, 53, won the accolade for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, which is dedicated to ‘prisoner 335’ – his father Archie.

His win will be all the more poignant since his father died last year - several hours after Flanagan called to tell him the book was finished.

The novel, which is his sixth, centres upon the experiences of surgeon Dorrigo Evans in a Japanese POW camp on the now infamous Thailand-Burma railway.

The Tasmanian-born author is the third Australian to win the coveted prize and will be seen by some as a conservative choice.

Critics have hit out at a decision to expand the prize this year to include all English writing rather than novels only from the UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth.

For the first time in its 46-year history, two American writers were shortlisted – but neither of them could win over the judges.

Announcing the prize winner, judging panel chair AC Grayling said Flanagan’s book was an ‘outstanding’, ‘superb’ novel.

He said: ‘It’s been a privilege to be on the Booker panel in a year when there have been such extraordinary books. And to end up with a book of this stature.

‘The best and the worst of judging books is when you come across one which kicks you so hard in the stomach that you can’t get up the next morning. You know it’s something extraordinary. And this is what happened with this book.’

He said the panel of six judges took three hours to decide and that the decision-making process was a ‘collegiate’ experience which produced a unanimous result.

He added that although the nationality of the authors caused controversy this year, that he tried to block it out of his head while judging.

And he said that his choice had shown fiction set in the past still had its place in contemporary culture, adding: ‘historical fiction is not history.’

‘This is a magnificent novel of love and war,’ he added. ‘Written in a prose of extraordinary elegance and force, it bridges East and West, past and present, with a story of guilt and heroism.'

He added: ‘It’s not really a war novel. It’s much more about people and their experience and their relationships.

‘The depiction is timeless. It’s not just about the Second World War, it’s about any war. It’s about the effect on the human being.’

Flanagan was presented with a trophy from The Duchess of Cornwall and a £50,000 cheque at a glittering event at London’s Guildhall last night.

The shortlist also included Indian-born London Neel Mukherjee, whose The Lives Of Others, set in India, was the 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill.

Two other British authors were among the six books to be shortlisted – former winner Howard Jacobson for his novel J, and Ali Smith for her ‘genre-bending’ novel How To Be Both.

The two US writers were Joshua Ferris for To Rise Again At A Decent Hour and Karen Joy for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves.

Previous winners have included Hilary Mantel, who won two prizes for her novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies.

Yesterday, Royal Mail announced that it would create a special postmark in Flanagan’s honour.
