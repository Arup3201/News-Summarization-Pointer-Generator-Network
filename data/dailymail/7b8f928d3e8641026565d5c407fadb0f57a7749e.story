The Health and Human Services Department will launch a special enrollment period for an estimated six million people who did not sign up for health care insurance coverage by the 2015 deadline, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services said Friday.

'We recognize that this is the first tax filing season where consumers may have to pay a fee or claim an exemption for not having health insurance coverage,' Marilyn Tavenner, CMS' administrator, said Friday in a statement.

CMS is the division of the the Health and Human Services Department that is overseeing Obamacare. Earlier this week HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell indicated that her department could authorize the extension and would make a decision 'quickly.'

Democratic lawmakers and their allies had been lobbying HHS to give Americans without healthcare insurance until the end of the April tax season to submit their applications, arguing that many are unaware of the consequences of not signing up. 

Obamacare enrollees receive assistance applying for medical coverage at a health insurance marketplace enrollment center in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday, which was to be the last day to sign up for 2015 coverage under the Affordable Care Act, until the Health and Human Services department delayed the deadline twice this week

HHSsaid Monday it would give Americans who were 'in line' to enroll when the application process ended on Sunday another week to sign up.  On Friday it said it would launch a special enrollment period for the estimated six million people who did not sign up for health care insurance coverage by the Feb. 15 deadline because they weren't aware of the fees

'We're going to analyze it, we're going to think about it,and we'll be back,' Burwell told reporters on Wednesday.

For the 2014 tax year, residents without health insurance will have to pay $95 to get out of the requirement, or 1 percent of their income, when they file their returns. 

The fine will increase to the greater of $395 or 2 percent of a household's income next year at filing time for anyone who missed the open enrollment period this month.

'Millions upon millions of people are unaware about these penalties,' Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a left-aligned group that advocated for Obamacare, said Wednesday, per the Hill.

HHS had already extended the deadline to enroll for approximately 150,000 people 'in line' to sign up but were prevented from completing their applications by a computer glitch or long wait times at call centers last weekend.

Those enrollees will have until Feb. 22 to fill out their forms, it said Monday.

Today it said it would reopen the federal health exchange from March 15 - April 30 for consumers who pay the fine in 2014 and submit that they only became aware of fees levied on taxpayers without health care when they filed their taxes this year.  

Some states had postponed the close of the their own marketplaces for a variety of reasons, and several others had indicated that they are considering the authorization of a special enrollment period that would extend until the end of April.

Vermont, Washington and Minnesota have announced grace periods. California, New York and Kentucky indicated they may do the same.

Congressional Democrats said all Americans should be afforded the opportunity to sign up for Obamcare late, and they urged HHS this week to grant their request for a nationwide special enrollment period.

Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and nine other Democratic senators sent a letter to the administration asking for leniency while House Democrats  Sandy Levin of Michigan, the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, Jim McDermott of Washington and Lloyd Doggett of Texas co-authored another.

Asked about the extension today, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called it a 'pretty novel solution to this challenge.'

Instead of paying a fee, millions of Americans will now have the opportunity to make sure their money is going to a good place - protecting themselves and their families with health care insurance.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia  Burwell said Wednesday there was a possibility HHS would authorize a special enrollment period on Wednesday

The Treasury Department in January estimated that as many as six million Americans without health coverage would not meet the government-mandated Feb. 15 to sign up for Obamacare. 

That was before HHS announced on Tuesday that it had vastly exceeded its own expectations and signed up 11.4 million Americans for health insurance from Nov. 15 through Sunday. 

'Sunday, February 15 was the biggest enrollment day ever: more new consumers signed up for health coverage than on any day this open enrollment period or the last,' the White House said in a statement, noting that one million Americans enrolled in the final nine days.

HHS had predicted that 9.9 million people would meet the deadline. 

The Congressional Budget Office was far more aggressive with its assessment. The non-partisan agency said it expected 13 million Americans to come forward in that amount of time. If HHS reopens the federal exchange, it could reach that mark.

The end of the open enrollment period was Feb. 15 - anyone without out health insurance who didn't sign up was to be slapped with a tax next year
