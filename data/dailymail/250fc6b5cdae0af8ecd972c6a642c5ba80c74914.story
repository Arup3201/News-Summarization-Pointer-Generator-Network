Babies born on the same day as  the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first child will receive a ‘lucky’ silver penny, the Royal Mint announced yesterday.

An average of 1,983 children are born each day in the UK, so 2,013 of the commemorative coins have been struck to be sure there will be enough to go round.

Each coin is worth £28 but parents can obtain one free by registering their child’s birth on the Royal Mint’s Facebook site.

The pennies are for babies born on the same day as the child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

Evidence will be required later in the form of a birth certificate.

The pennies, marked 2013, feature a shield of the Royal Arms and will be sent out in a blue or pink purse.

They will be accompanied by a card  decorated with a teddy bear and the message ‘Solid sterling silver good luck penny.’

The Duke and Duchess’s baby, who will be third in line to the throne, is due to be born around the middle of this month.

her husband Prince William earlier this month, is due to give birth next Saturday

The silver pennies are being issued by the Royal Mint - makers of the nation's currency

Throughout history crossing the palm 
of a newborn baby with silver or offering them a silver penny was seen 
as a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life.

Shane Bissett, director of 
commemorative coins at the Royal Mint, said: ‘The birth of the royal 
baby will be a joyous occasion not just for Their Royal Highnesses The 
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge but also for the whole nation, as we 
prepare to celebrate another remarkable milestone in their life journey 
together.

‘However it will also be a special day
for many mothers and fathers across the country as they too welcome the
arrival of their new baby, hence why we wanted to extend this 
historical moment to them with a lucky silver penny.’

Parents will have to register their child’s name on Facebook.com/theroyalmint within 60 days of their birth.

The Royal Mint has an unbroken history of minting British coinage dating back more than 1,000 years.

It makes a small profit each year, which will be used to pay for the baby coins.

It is likely the pennies will be hugely sought after, unlike many other royal baby souvenirs.

From a crown-embossed potty to a 
£10,000 silver necklace with a pot for  storing nappy cream, there has 
already been plenty of commemorative ‘tat’ brought out to celebrate the 
forthcoming royal birth.

They will be presented in a blue or pink pouch, inside a card decorated with a teddy bear
