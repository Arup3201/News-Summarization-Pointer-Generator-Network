The makers of Immigration Street have been accused of hindering a police probe over alleged crimes which took place during filming of the controversial documentary. 

The Channel 4 show, created by the team behind Benefits Street, focused on Derby Road, a street in a deprived area of Southampton where just 17 per cent are considered white British.

The programme, which aired last night, divided opinion on the street, with those who had agreed to take part reportedly being threatened by those against the production.

The furore around the filming even led to film crew being subjected to verbal threats from locals and being pelted with stones - a scene which featured in the documentary. 

But police claim that programme makers have failed to assist their investigations into the incidents, by refusing to provide statements about the allegations.

Superintendent James Fulton, Southampton's police commander, told The Daily Telegraph: 'We did receive reports of a number of confrontations between local groups and film crew.

'However, Channel 4 has declined to provide any statements which would provide us with the evidence necessary to make follow-up inquiries against suspects, so we have been unable to take these allegations any further.'

Love Productions said it believed an official complaint against individuals would 'make life more difficult for contributors'. 

It added that police were belatedly permitted to watch the show just before it began on Channel 4. 

The broadcast of the hour-long programme came after ten months of fierce campaigning by residents who have made repeated attempts to force producers to axe the show.

The strength of feeling led to one man being allegedly beaten up after standing up for a local resident who chose to participate in the film.

Separately, local gang members threatened to shoot production staff, demanded £200,000 protection money and allegedly slashed tyres on a crew member's vehicle, it was reported.

A scene on last night's programme showed a masked youth shouting at camera crew: 'Get out of this f*****g area. Next time, gunshot', while pelting them with grit.

There was also footage of the  production crew discussing the threats they had received and making calls to locals who they believed would be at risk.

After the attack, security consultants told producers that filming should be cut short, amid fears for their safety.

The broadcaster's initial plan had been to have an entire series filmed on the street, but that was scaled back following the confrontation.   

There had also been a public meeting organised by disgruntled locals during which the show's producer Kieran Smith was shouted down.

Security consultants told producers that an attack and threats was so serious that filming was cut short

He said afterwards: 'Many people on Derby Road made the crew feel welcome and wanted to share their stories but there were local groups who, for their own reasons, were determined to halt production.

'It's a great shame as the footage we have shot shows Derby Road is a place where, on the whole, people of different nationalities, cultures and religions respect and get along with each other. This will be reflected in the film.' 

And Channel 4 said: 'On the street itself, verbal aggression was turning into threats of violence. Finally the producers reluctantly took the decision to pull out, as the safety of the crew could no longer be guaranteed.'     

Earlier this week, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady has added her voice to calls for Channel 4 to cancel the documentary. She followed in the footsteps of local MP Alan Whitehead, who urged makers to reconsider scheduling the programme. 

Ms O'Grady said: 'Channel 4 needs to respect the views of the Southampton community and cancel Immigration Street.

'The show looks set to encourage social division and hostility towards migrants and the black, minority and ethnic community. Instead of such irresponsible broadcasting, the media should expose how communities are suffering from the shocking impact of low wages, lousy contracts and cuts to services.'  

A Channel 4 had said claims of racism were 'pure fiction'.

They said: 'We understand immigration is a much debated issue which is why Channel 4, as a public service broadcaster has a duty to explore it and not shy away from difficult subject such as this.

'Anyone who does not want to be in the series won't be but we intend to continue to film with residents who are very happy to share their experience of living on Derby Road.'

The programme was billed as a follow-on from Channel 4's controversial Benefits Street which aired last year and sparked a nationwide debate about welfare in Britain.

The five-part series, which first aired in January 2014, provoked hundreds of complaints to police, broadcast watchdog Ofcom, and Channel 4.

Among them were claims it portrayed criminal activities, foul language and misleading portrayals of those on benefits.

Some critics labelled it 'poverty porn' and said it painted a false picture of life in modern Britain.

Channel 4 was criticised for demonising those living on the breadline, while some of the residents claim they were misled into appearing. 

Those starring in the series, including single mother White Dee (real name Deirdre Kelly), were also subjected to death threats by Twitter trolls.

The show even attracted fierce political debate and was the subject of the Prime Minister's Questions.
