It seems to be customary for Manchester United's new signings; penning a deal at Old Trafford and later going to a particular Italian restaurant in the city centre.

And it was no different for goalkeeper Victor Valdes, who dined out at the popular San Carlo establishment after agreeing an 18-month contract with the Red Devils.

Fans posed for pictures with the former Barcelona star, who will provide competition to current No 1 David de Gea.

Fellow Spanish-speakers Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo also enjoyed a meal at San Carlo shortly after arriving in England.

Valdes then posed with his new Chevrolet at the Aon training complex after his photo call with new manager Louis van Gaal.

The shirt sponsorship deal with the car company started in the summer, with all new arrivals getting a picture taken next to the set of wheels.

Meanwhile, Valdes couldn't contain his excitement after signing for United.

'For me, it is like a dream. I played for Barca for a lot of years and that is also a big club, I have loved the club all my life. 

'I think this is the same. It is a big club around the world with a lot of fans.'
