Zinedine Zidane has revealed he would be keen to manage Real Madrid if he was offered the role by club president Florentino Perez.

Zidane has been in charge of Madrid's Castilla side since deciding to focus on his own managerial career following his season-long stint as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant.

Ancelotti has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following Madrid's recent poor run of form, which has seen them lose three of their last four games.

And Zidane, speaking to Canal+, has admitted he would be keen on replacing Ancelotti if the Italian was to leave the La Liga giants.

'If the post of Real's coach was proposed to me, I would certainly agree. But there is a coach right now who is doing a very good job. And I'm in a structure and still learning.

'Am I ready for the job? You are never ready, and even if you're not you still say yes. As a player, I didn't forge my career in two years. Things happen gradually. In coaching, it will be the same.

'l've learned a lot from Carlo and he knows what I think of him. He is the perfect coach for Madrid, despite what people say.'

Zidane has learned a lot from both Jose Mourinho and Ancelotti since hanging up his boots in 2006

Zidane insists he is ready to tackle club management after learning a lot from both Ancelotti and former Real boss Jose Mourinho.

He added: 'From Mourinho, what I learned is that he never gives up. His handling is surprising, but he is right because he is harsh, yet fair. After a while it can be heavy, but he is fair and does everything for his players.

'For Ancelotti, it's different. He is a 'cool dad' with his players, he's more patient. But he also knows that sometimes you need to be harsh.'
