The influential former archbishop of San Francisco said Monday that Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony has a rightful place in selecting the next pope, despite pressure for him to not attend the papal conclave over rising allegations he covered up priest sex abuse.

The support from Cardinal William Levada, who was in charge of handling the sex abuse scandal for the Vatican until recently, comes as Pope Benedict XVI revealed he will take the title of 'emeritus pope' after he abdicates at the end of the month.

Levada, who led the Archdioceses of San Francisco for a decade until he became a prefect in Rome, slammed sex abuse victims who are calling for Mahony to stay home when it comes time to select the next pope.

'There are some victims groups for whom enough is never enough, so we 
have to do our jobs as best we see it,' said Levada, 76, who spoke with 
reporters from a Menlo Park seminary as he prepared for his trip to the 
Vatican for the papal conclave.

Mahony left for Rome over the weekend after recently released church documents showed he had covered up for other priests who raped and molested children in the Archdioceses of Los Angeles while he was Archbishop.

Levada said: 'He has apologized for errors in judgment that were made. I believe he should be at the conclave.'

On Monday, Mahony took to social media and his own personal blog to write about 'persecution and forgiving one's enemies.' He said he has a special prayer group for people who 'cannot forgive me for my past hurts and offenses,' including members of the media, attorneys, protesters and those who 'hate and despise me.'

He also tweeted from Rome, writing: 'Anyone interested in loving your enemies, or doing good to those who persecute you? See my blog for today. Wow, Jesus is demanding.'

Levada said Cardinal Keith O'Brien's decision Monday to step down as archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh and to opt out of the conclave will 'provide the freedom to do a good independent investigation and decide on appropriate measures to take on this case.'

As Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, O'Brien was Britain's highest-ranking Catholic leader.

He said he did not want 
allegations that he engaged in improper conduct with priests to be a 
distraction during the solemn process of choosing the next leader of the
church's 1.2 billion-member flock.

Stepping down: Pope Benedict XVI will continue to wear white vestments and will be known as 'pope emeritus' after he steps down

It was the first time a cardinal has recused himself from a conclave 
because of personal scandal, according to Vatican historians.

The Vatican insisted that Pope Benedict XVI accepted Cardinal O'Brien's resignation purely because O'Brien was nearing the retirement 
age of 75 - not because of the accusations.

Levada, who leaves for Rome on Tuesday, retired in 2012 after spending six years as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican's orthodoxy watchdog, which also defrocked pedophile priests.

He played a key role in several church sex-abuse reforms. While serving previously as an archbishop in California and Oregon, he kept some accused molesters in the church and failed to share some allegations with police or parishioners.

Levada and Mahony will join more than 100 cardinals on Thursday in Rome 
to begin the historical process that will choose a successor to Pope 
Benedict XVI, whose decision to retire took worldwide Catholics by 
surprise.

Levada, whose Vatican job was held by the former Cardinal Joseph 
Ratzinger before he became Pope Benedict XVI, said in all his years of 
service, he never anticipated being called to a conclave.

Levada also said bureaucratic reforms at the Vatican will require a lot 
of attention from the next pope. He said he'll be looking for a 
candidate with deep faith, someone who has shown leadership and has 
language skills. He said youth is also a factor, and he extinguished any
rumors that the next pope might be from the U.S.

'I don't know what the Las Vegas oddsmakers are saying today,' he said, 'but I don't think it's likely that we would see an American pope.

'It 
would be an additional complexity for an American pope to have to deal 
with the perception that some of his decisions might be perceived to be 
dictated by American governmental policy.'

Replaced: Benedict will wear a pair of custom-made brown loafers that were given to him during a 2012 trip to Mexico

It was revealed on Tuesday that Pope Benedict XVI will be known as 'emeritus pope' in his retirement and will continue to wear a white cassock, the Vatican announced Tuesday.

The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Benedict himself had made the decision in consultation with others.

Benedict decided he would be called 'Your Holiness Benedict XVI' and either emeritus pope or emeritus Roman pontiff, Lombardi said.

While he will no longer wear his trademark red shoes, Benedict has taken a liking to a pair of hand-crafted brown loafers made for him by artisans in Leon, Mexico, and presented to him during his 2012 visit. He will wear those in retirement, Lombardi said.
