Mike Ingham, the voice of football for a generation of radio listeners, will step down after the World Cup final, marking the end of an era for BBC sport.

Ingham has been chief football correspondent for more than 20 years, bringing his unique blend of effortless eloquence and good sense to the Beeb’s football coverage.

In a time when others shout, scream and deliberately  provoke in the quest for attention, his delivery has remained steadfastly calm, clear-headed and intelligent, adding to his natural authority and earning him the respect of managers and players.

Honour: Ingham was made an MBE by the Queen at Buckingham Palace back in November 2010

His final live game will not be a storybook ending featuring England in the Maracana, but Argentina and Germany provide a fitting end with a repeat of the final from his first World Cup in 1986.

‘The world has gone full circle,’ said Ingham. ‘I’ve no idea how many games I’ve commentated on but over 30 years it’s probably around 2,000. I don’t know how I’ll cope with the last one.

‘You get in a bubble when you’re working. It will probably hit me the day after, or when the Champions League music plays next season. Certainly when England play Switzerland. That’s when I will realise my life has changed.’

It all started on BBC Radio Derby, where Ingham worked for six years from 1973, often working on the coverage of Derby County, the team he supported as a boy.

A famous 3-0 win against Benfica at the Baseball Ground in the European Cup is one of his fondest memories of days on the terraces and, years later, he would be light-heartedly unveiled as a Rams fan, live on air during a Derby game, by co-commentator Bruce Rioch.

Ingham moved to Broadcasting House in London, presenting key programmes such as Sport on Two and took over from Bryon Butler as football correspondent in 1991, with the game on the threshold of a revolution.

‘The onset of the Premier League and the volume of games broadcast live on radio has been the biggest change,’ said Ingham, who was in the commentary box when Brian Deane scored the first Premier League goal.

He maintained his ability to find the crucial elements of any story amid the chaos and crystallise it for the listener, as he did brilliantly on the night England’s players threatened to strike over Rio Ferdinand’s ban for a missed drugs test.

Ingham has always been a huge music fan, often seen searching for second-hand record shops while on trips abroad. And he enjoys fine wine, as Terry Butcher, his co-commentator on many occasions, can testify.

Retirement will allow him more time to devote to these hobbies and to his family, wife Lorna and children George, 13 tomorrow, and Marshall, 20. ‘They have been my rocks,’ he said.

Ingham will still be an occasional voice on Radio 5 Live, working on some of the channel’s documentaries. John Murray will take over as BBC football correspondent.
