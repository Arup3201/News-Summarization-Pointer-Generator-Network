Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson wants to speak to Indonesian President Joko Widodo

Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson has written a heartfelt letter to Indonesian President Joko Widodo pleading for him to save the lives of those facing the death penalty in the southeast Asian country. 

The British businessman, who's also a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, said he was willing to go to Indonesia in an effort to save those facing execution.

Sir Richard, along with other Global Drug Commissioners, wrote to President Joko urging clemency for all drug convicts currently on death row in Indonesia, including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

The letter, which described the death penalty as inhumane, said the drug trade remained unaffected by the threat of capital punishment. 

'Countries that still carry out executions for drug offences have not seen any significant shifts in supply and demand,' he wrote.

The Virgin boss pleaded: 'Mr. President, we hope you will consider our plea and spare those named above this ultimate and irreversible punishment. 

'Granting clemency would be a humane and righteous act, and a first step towards sensible reform that could become a shining example for the entire Asian region.' 

Sir Richard told the ABC he was willing to get on a plane bound for Indonesia as early as Wednesday.

'What we would love to do is speak with the president of Indonesia and try to give them a way forward, a positive way forward for its country,' the entrepreneur told the ABC on Wednesday morning.

'We have written to the president saying if he will have us we would love to come and talk ... we want to be as constructive as possible.

'All we're saying is there is a better approach.'   

'I am willing to go and get on a plane today, tomorrow ... as are a number of the other commissioners,' he said.

He said research showed it was better to 'treats drugs as a health issue not as a criminal issue'.

'It actually helps lower the number of drug deaths, it limits the spread of infectious diseases like HIV and AIDS or hepatitis C, and it reduces drug-related crime,' he said.

Chan converted to Christianity and became a pastor while behind bars and carried a bible with him when he was transported to the Indonesian death island on Wednesday

Sir Richard's call comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott continues to plead for the lives of Chan and Sukumaran.

The two Bali Nine ringleaders are in isolation on the Indonesian penal island of Nusakambangan, awaiting the outcome of legal appeals against their execution.

Mr Abbott is waiting to hear whether his request to speak again to President Joko about the fate of the two Australians will be accepted.
