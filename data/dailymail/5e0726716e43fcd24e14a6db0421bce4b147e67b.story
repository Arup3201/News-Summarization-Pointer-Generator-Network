Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin says his agency will not be blamed if Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are executed in Indonesia.

Mr Colvin, who was chief of staff to former commissioner Mick Keelty when the Bali Nine smuggling ring members were arrested in Indonesia in 2005, was critical of media commentary surrounding the role the AFP played in the original arrest.

Mr Colvin dubbed criticism of the AFP's actions, which included handing information over to Indonesian authorities that led to the arrests, as 'misinformed and misguided.'

Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin says his agency will not be blamed if Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are executed in Indonesia.

'Put simply, do we have blood on our hands? No,' Mr Colvin said on Thursday.

'Put simply, were we part of a conspiracy for greater co-operation that I've seen written about? No. 

'There is nothing I could say today ... that's not been put on the records in courts in Australia; in the Federal Court when we were challenged about our role.' 

'Put simply, do we have blood on our hands? No,' Mr Colvin said on Thursday.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten stood together at a candlelight vigil for the Bali Nine duo. 

Mr Colvin's comments come a day after Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, were transferred to 'Death Island', where the two men are set to be killed by firing squad. 

The transfer from Bali's Kerobokan prison came as Australian politicians and officials continued their 11th-hour pleas for Chan and Sukumaran to be spared.

'It's our hope the Indonesian government will reconsider its decision to proceed with the executions,' Andrew Colvin. 

Mr Colvin said the AFP had been working 'for many months' alongside the government in efforts to push for clemency for the pair.

'It's our hope the Indonesian government will reconsider its decision to proceed with the executions.'

Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced in 2006 for their parts in a plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia.
