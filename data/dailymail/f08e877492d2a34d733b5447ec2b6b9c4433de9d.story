Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell had tears in her eyes as she was sentenced Friday to a year and a day in federal prison after what the judge referred to as a 'tragic, sad and puzzling' case.

This after McDonnell supporters testified she is a thoughtful woman devoted to her family, but who was overwhelmed by her political role, prior to her sentencing in a public corruption case that destroyed her husband's career.

McDonnell may now become the first modern-day governor's spouse sent to prison for felonies she was convicted of committing while she held the mostly ceremonial position.

She will however remain free on bond while her appeal is pending, much like her husband, who was previously sentenced to two years in prison for his role in their actions.

The McDonnells were convicted in September of doing favors for the CEO of a nutritional supplements company in exchange for $165,000 in gifts and loans.

McDonnell spoke in court Friday before she was sentenced, telling the judge; 'My marriage is broken, my reputation is shattered.'

She added; 'I started a chain of events that brought embarrassment on us all.' 

US Attorney Jessica Aber also spoke before the sentencing, saying; 'Corruption in government is not normal.'

She then added; 'Harsh penalties must be imposed on public officials who accept bribes and on those who assist them in accepting bribes,' before referring to McDonnell's actions as 'opportunistic greed.' 

The Washington Post reports; 'After the hearing’s conclusion, Maureen McDonnell turned around and briefly embraced her husband, former Governor Bob McDonnell, as he kissed her on her cheek. She then turned to her children, Cailin, Rachel and Bobby McDonnell, offering them much longer hugs, each in turn.'

Friday's proceedings began with several character witnesses, who said McDonnell has already suffered enough from the convictions and media attention that have driven her family apart.

Friend Lisa Kratz Thomas said Maureen has barely left her house since she was convicted last September and has little social interaction outside of a Bible study.

'She's lost her dignity,' Thomas said. 

'She's really become a prisoner in her own home.'

Daughter Rachel McDonnell said the scandal surrounding her parents has driven her family apart and that her mother feels "very alone."

Several character witnesses asked that Maureen McDonnell be spared prison time.
