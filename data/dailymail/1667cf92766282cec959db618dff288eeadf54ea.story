The creator of hit U.S. gang crime drama The Wire has claimed legalising cannabis would only help 'white middle-class kids' and there is a 'racial bias' in his country's multi-billion dollar war on drugs.

Former Baltimore crime reporter David Simon, whose bleak portrait of his drug-ravaged home city has been hailed as the greatest television drama of all time, said he wanted the drugs debate re-framed.

Speaking at a debate hosted by the Observer  at the Royal Institution in London, Simon called the government crusade against drugs 'a holocaust in slow motion'.

Asked about recent votes in Colorado and Washington to legalise marijuana, he said: 'I'm against it.

'The last thing I want
 to do is rationalise the easiest, the most benign end of this. The 
whole concept needs to be changed, the debate reframed.

'I want the thing to fall as one complete edifice. If they manage to let a few white middle-class people off the hook, that's very dangerous. If they can find a way for white kids in middle-class suburbia to get high without them going to jail and getting them to think that what they do is a million miles away from black kids taking crack, that is what politicians would do.'

Simon claimed if marijuana were legalised it would mean another 10 to 40 years of 'assigning people of colour to this dystopia', the Observer reported.

He argued that the American economy has left 10 to 12 per cent of the population 'abandoned' without any hope of finding work.

As a result, he claimed the dealing drugs was the only industry left in places such as Baltimore and east St Louis.

The Wire creator Simon said the drugs war is making cost-effective policing on the streets of Baltimore too easy, to the detriment of police work on non drug-related crime. Pictured is a scene from series one of the drama

Simon said Baltimore had seen a decrease in arrests for non-drug offences from 70 to 90 per cent to 20 to 40 per cent

He described it as making 'cost-efficient' policing in Baltimore whereby small-time dealers are picked up on the street easy for the authorities.

But he said criminal activity other than drugs was ignored because prosecutions were expensive and time-consuming.

Simon said Baltimore had seen a decrease in arrests for non-drug offences from 70 to 90 per cent to 20 to 40 per cent, while drug-related arrests increased on some beats from 5,000 to 30,000.

Simon concluded that the policy has made the city more unsafe while drugs have become cheaper and more available than ever.

Simon's long-running saga, which looked at the dark underbelly of the city of Baltimore, ran for five seasons on HBO.

Each season of The Wire focused on a different facet of the drugs trade in the city of Baltimore, Maryland.

In order they were the drug trade on the streets, the seaport system, corruption within the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media.

The Wire, which ran from 2002 to 2008 
and became a huge cult hit, being hailed by many critics as the best 
television programme of the last decade or even of all time.
