Tragic: Logan Kushner died after smoking K2 synthetic marijuana before jumping into a creek

A promising college American football player drowned after smoking K2 synthetic marijuana and jumping in a creek.

Logan Matthew Kushner had bought K2 with a friend legally from a neighbourhood gas station before smoking the synthetic product and jumping into a park creek early on Sunday morning in Clearwater, Florida.

According to reports, Kushner's friend whom police did not name, persuaded the 19-year-old to get out of the water and told him they needed to leave.

But when Kushner opted to stay, the friend left him behind at the park.

The
Palm Harbor University High School student, who also played football 
for the school's team, The Hurricanes, did not answer calls to his phone
after being left alone.

After failing to contact him, Kushner's friends went to the creek and found him unresponsive in the water, according to police.

He was pronounced dead at Mease Countryside Hospital.

Kushner had been smoking K2, which is branded as an incense but also called 'fake weed'.

K2
and similar substances are known to be synthetic cannabinoids 
significantly more powerful than marijuana, according to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration.

Dangerous effects: The number of people falling ill after taking synthetic drugs like K2 and Ivory Wave has rocketed in the the last year

Normally sold by the gram in brightly-coloured packaging, the substances are known to induce dizziness and hallucinations.

Users can also experience paranoia, anxiety and agitation, as well as physical side-effects such as high blood pressure and heart rate, panic attacks and seizures.

Laboratory-made drugs have been around since the middle of the 20th century, when LSD was first studied.

But synthetic marijuana - produced by spraying dried plant material with a chemical compound - has only been around for the last few years.

Effects include paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, seizures and a rapid heartbeat and symptoms can last for days.

Doctors usually treat overdoses with anti-anxiety drugs like Valium and Xanax which slow the heart rate.

One patient told a doctor at the Carolinas Poison Center it was 'like being on cocaine, but ten times worse'.

When friends found Kushner, he was discovered unresponsive in the water.

He has since been remembered as a 'popular kid with a good heart', while devastated school friends have set up a Facebook tribute page and organised a vigil.

Andrea Weaver, 40, his 10th grade English teacher, said: 'He was upbeat. He always had a smile.'

Police have yet to reveal what caused Kushner to drown, or whether he was under the influence of any other substance at the time of his death.

Fake forms of marijuana were sold 
online and in drug paraphernalia shops and convenience stores until the 
DEA banned the use and sale of their key ingredients in March.

Shortly
after the ban, however, various manufacturers began advertising other 
fake marijuana products, many of which are sold online.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, a gas station near Clearwater was selling a substance called Scooby Snax Potpourri on Sunday.

Despite its name, the product warned it was not meant for human consumption.

The company's website asserted that the product does not contain any of the compounds banned under synthetic cannabinoids legislation.
