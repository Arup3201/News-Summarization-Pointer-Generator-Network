Has already been used by over 4m people in America, Canada and India

It's coming: The people behind Botox are creating a product to help boost eyelash growth

When Botox became available as a beauty treatment six years ago it was hailed by many as nothing short of a miracle.

A-listers such as Simon Cowell, Nicole Kidman and Sharon Osbourne have admitted to trying the popular treatment that promises to turn back time in just one session.

And now the people behind the face-freezing phenomenon are focusing on developing a product to boost our eyelashes.

Healthcare company Allergan have 
developed a product called Latisse, which is described as 'a 
prescription treatment for hypotrichosis (inadequate or not enough 
lashes) to grow eyelashes longer, fuller, darker.'

It
 was first discovered when it's main ingredient bimatropost, which was 
used to treat glucoma (where high pressure in the eye damages nerves), 
notably increased growth and thickness of eyelashes as a side-effect.

Now,
 the new product which contains bimatropost, has already been used by 
over 4million women in American, India and Canada and is currently being
 tested out by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Agency approval process, reports Sunday Times Style magazine.

Loss of lashes is often common in older women and that is where Latisse works well because it slows down eyelash loss.

It is also great for people who, like The Only Way is Essex star Sam Faiers, suffer Trichotillomania - a disorder which causes people to pull out their real eyelashes.

And it appears to work. Research has proven that it doubles eyelash thickness and makes lashes 18 per cent darker and 25 per cent longer in just eight weeks after being swept onto the lashes once daily like an eyeliner.

The way it works is with an active ingredient called bimatoprost, which is one of the first chemicals to show promised hair growth.

'Latisse Is 0.93% bimatoprost, an eye drop liquid that is used to treat hypotrichosis which is a reduced growth of hair in a specific area.

'It is used topically on the affected area and over about 16 weeks, boosts hair growth.

'Bimatoprost is usually used for glaucoma treatment in higher concentrations. However, it may have unpleasant side effects. Hence it's use is strictly by prescription,' said Raina Zarb Adami, one of Allergan's county ambassadors.

On the company's website, side effects are cited as: 'Increased brown pigmentation of the colored part of the eye which is likely permanent.'

It also states: 'Eyelid skin darkening may occur and may be reversible. Hair may grow on skin that Latisse frequently touches. Common side effects are itchy and red eyes.'

Another downside is the price and at £80-£100 for a month's supply, it doesn't come cheap.

Also. if discontinued, lashes gradually return to their previous appearance.

Alex Karidis, Cosmetic Surgeon to the stars, said: 'This product is very effective and I do think it will be big in the UK because which women don't want fuller eyelashes?

'Most women use false eyelashes and appreciate longer lashes so I think it will appeal brilliantly.

'There have been some known side effects but these can be minimised by applying it accurately.

'It even works on eyebrows.' Cara Delevingne watch out.
