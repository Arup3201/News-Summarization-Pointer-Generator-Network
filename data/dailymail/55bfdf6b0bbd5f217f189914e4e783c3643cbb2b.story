An asthma sufferer died of pneumonia the day after a GP failed to take her case seriously and did not refer her to hospital, a tribunal has heard.

Dr John Frain, Dr Philip Dodgson and Dr Andrew Ratcliffe are all accused of a series of errors in their treatment of the young woman in the run up to her death.

The woman was a regular visitor to the Derwent Valley Medical Practice, in Derby, in the weeks before she died.

The hearing was told how she complained of chest problems in appointments with all three doctors.

She died on December 31, 2010, a day after she had a consultation with Dr Frain.

The three doctors are facing allegations of misconduct at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester.

Nicholas De La Poer, for the General Medical Council told the panel: ‘For so many people this is an extremely tragic case.

‘Patient A’s untimely death left her family and friends bereft and caused an inquiry into these three doctors with long, successful and unblemished careers.

‘Serious failings have been uncovered and some have been admitted.

‘I invite you, notwithstanding the emotional context, to set such emotion aside and consider the facts.’

Dr Frain is accused of failings during four consultations with the patient between November 23 and December 30, 2010.

The GMC say he did not adequately assess Patient A or provide appropriate treatment or advice and failed to refer her to hospital the day before she died.

Mr De La Poer said: ‘Failure to make a note of the second part of the consultation on December 30 speaks volumes about how seriously Dr Frain was treating Patient A on that day.

‘It is inconceivable that had he had things he should have at the forefront of his mind, quite how serious Patient A’s condition was on December 30, it is inconceivable that he would have omitted and forgot to make a note.

‘The fact that he did speaks volumes about how seriously he was treating the consultation.’

careers'

He went on to say: ‘His failure to refer Patient A to hospital on December 30 also reveals Dr Frain was simply not taking Patient A’s condition sufficiently seriously.

‘It is absolutely obvious that Patient A should have been sent to hospital on December 30.’

Dr Frain has admitted failures in his record keeping, but denies the remaining charges.

Marios Lambis, defending Dr Frain, said: ‘Firstly we submit that the GMC has failed to bring before you a sufficiently cogent level of evidence to prove the case, even on the balance of probabilities.

‘Secondly that the GMC’s case comes to this: the expert evidence relied upon by the GMC tells you that Dr Frain should have done the things that are the subject matter of the allegations.

‘We say that expert evidence is not only flawed in and of itself, but that on scrutiny it must be wrong.’

He added: ‘Thirdly, we submit everything you know about Dr Frain indicates in the strongest terms that Dr Frain would not have and did not do what the GMC alleges.

‘He would not have been cavalier or risky in Patient A’s care.’

Dr Dodgson, who admits inadequate record keeping, is accused of failing to provide good care to his patient during a consultation on December 14, 2010.

The GMC say he failed to adequately assess her, make an appropriate diagnosis, provide necessary treatment or diagnosis and give her proper advice.

Mr De La Poer said: ‘The truth, I submit, is that it is as simple as it appears. This was a three minute appointment in which, as the note reveals, very little was done.’

Dr Dodgson claims that his treatment was adequate, despite the lack of notes.

‘Despite the inadequacy of the notes you can track his thinking and record that he has taken the right steps and made the right diagnoses,’ said George Hugh-Jones QC, defending the doctor.

‘He accepted his shortcomings. He was accepting of his naivety about matters after the death,’ he added.

‘We say his diagnoses are accurate and he must have been exercising care.’

Dr Ratcliffe has admitted over-prescribing benzodiazepines to Patient A between December 2009 and December 2010.

He is further accused of failing to provide good clinical care to the patient during a consultation on December 29, 2010.

‘He has candidly admitted that on December 29 he just got it wrong,’ Mr De La Poer said.

‘He does not seek to dispute that he failed to take Patient A sufficiently seriously on that day.’

Dr Ratcliffe says he did consider alternative diagnoses, but admits inadequate record keeping.

Richard Partridge, defending Dr Ratcliffe, said: ‘The failure was in not having a sufficient degree of the seriousness of these diagnoses, not whether they were considered or not.’

The fitness practise panel must first make decisions on the facts of the case before going on to decide if any of their actions amount to misconduct.

If any of the doctors’ fitness to practise is found impaired they could face sanctions on their registration, which include conditions, suspension or, in the most serious of cases, being struck off the medical register.

The hearing continues.
