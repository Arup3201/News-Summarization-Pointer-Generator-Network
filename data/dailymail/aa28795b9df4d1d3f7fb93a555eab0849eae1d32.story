Roy Hodgson will hand Harry Kane his England debut at Wembley on Friday evening — but the indications are that it will be off the bench.

Kane, who is man of the moment after scoring 19 goals in the Barclays Premier League for Tottenham this season, will play some part in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

England’s head coach is expected to play captain Wayne Rooney at the tip of a three-man attack that will include Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck.

The likely line-ups for Friday night's clash between England and Lithuania at Wembley

England have won all four of their qualifying matches so far in Group E and have a six-point lead

England have won their opening four group games and Hodgson does not want to upset the side’s rhythm.

Phil Jones is expected to start in place of Phil Jagielka, with Fabian Delph and Michael Carrick starting alongside Jordan Henderson in the centre of midfield. 

But a knee injury may force James Milner to wait until Tuesday’s friendly with Italy.

Left back Leighton Baines will return to Everton after the Lithuania clash and will be replaced by Southampton’s Ryan Bertrand.
