Former Liverpool player Jermaine Pennant may still be without a club but he is making sure he keeps himself busy in the meantime, most recently DJ-ing in Liverpool on Saturday night.

The 31-year-old, who has been without a team since being released by Stoke in January, proved to be a hit on the decks as he and TOWIE star Mario Falcone hosted a party at Playground in the Hilton, Liverpool.

Pennant also DJ'ed in Hanley earlier this summer, while getting married to long-term girlfriend and glamour model Alice Goodwin.

Free agent: Pennant is looking for a new club following his release from Stoke City in January

The dimunitive winger was linked with Napoli earlier this summer which would have meant a reunion with former boss Rafa Benitez, whom he flourished under at Anfield playing in a Champions League final, but that failed to materialise.

Pennant last featured in the Premier League on the opening day of last season, but with the transfer window still open to acquire free agents, the experienced winger could well be a decent option for struggling Premier League or promotion-chasing Championship outfits to consider.

If not he certainly has a place on the decks with his ever-growing list of fans turning up in their masses for his sets.
