The mother of a 17-year-old honors student who was among 10 people killed in a bus crash in northern California is suing FedEx for $100m, alleging its trucks have a history of catching fire.

The negligence suit is the first filed in connection with the freeway crash in Orland on April 10, according to A. King Aminpour, the attorney for the plaintiffs.

The suit was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Rosa Rivera, mother of Jennifer Bonilla of Los Angeles.

The mother of a 17-year-old honors student who was among 10 people killed in the Northern California bus crash is suing FedEx

The Dorsey High School student had earned a college scholarship. She and other teens were heading north for a free tour of Humboldt State University when the bus was struck head-on by a FedEx truck.

Dozens escaped through windows before the bus exploded into flames, but five students, three adult chaperones and both drivers died.

'She had her whole future before her,' Aminpour said of Bonilla. 'She was the first in her family to ever go to college.'

The California Highway Patrol has not determined the cause of the crash 100 miles north of Sacramento.

Some witnesses reported that the FedEx truck was on fire before the crash, and the lawsuit alleges that FedEx trucks have a history of catching fire from mechanical problems, driver error or improper cargo loading.

'Our heartfelt condolences remain with everyone affected by this tragic accident,' FedEx Corp., based in Memphis, Tennessee, said in a statement.

Police re-enact the crash using a charter bus and a FedEx big rig of the same make and model as those involved in this month's truck-bus collision as part of their investigation

'We remain focused on providing support to those affected and cooperating with the authorities as they conduct their investigation.

'This is not the time for us to discuss potential litigation.'

The suit also names the estate of the FedEx driver and the bus owner, Silverado Stages, as defendants.

The lawsuit contends the bus lacked adequate exit doors that would have allowed passengers to escape after the crash.

A message from Associated Press seeking comment from a Silverado Stages executive after hours Tuesday was not immediately returned.
