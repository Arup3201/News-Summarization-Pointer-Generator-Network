Today, the government will release the information that will affect our spending over the next 365 days, leaving Brits tightening their belts accordingly. 

But for the super rich, the only way their belts are going is super-wide. 

New research has shown that men and women at the top end of the pay scale will be splashing the cash on clothes and accessories over the next 12 months. 

New research has shown that men and women at the top end of the pay scale will be splashing the cash in 2015 

British women will spend 43 per cent more on dresses this year than they did in 2014, but the average amount of on a dress by the wealthy has increased from £172 to £245 in the past 12 months.

They will also be spending an extra £50 on their favourite pairs of jeans - denim doesn't come cheap and a pair of trousers from brands like Frame Denim and J Brand can now cost £140 a pair.

Well-off men aren't immune to the grooming bug either - they are now spending more than women on their favourite pairs of shoes. 

Britain's wealthy men are spending upwards of £312 on a pair of designer trainers from brands like Balenciaga and Guiseppe Zanotti in 2015, whereas women in the same pay bracket will spend £245 on a pair of luxury heels.

The research was compiled by shopping website Lyst, who cater for three million high end customers with more than 9,000 brands like Balenciaga, Alexander Wang and Burberry on their books. 

With the recession now just a far distant memory for Britain's rich, they have now returned to their favourite designers with gusto. 

Britain's wealthy women are now spending an average of £248.96 on a designer handbag 

And since 2008, new brands have now started to dominate the luxury market like Michael Kors, whose handbags and watches are now a go-to for semi-affordable luxury. 

The introduction of brands like this has pushed up the average price of a handbag among Britain's wealthy shoppers. 

The average value spent on a handbag by these shoppers currently sits at £248.96, with US brands Michael Kors, Tory Burch and Marc by Marc Jacobs inspiring most purchases.

Coat budgets are also rocketing thanks to the trend for 'statement coats' in the last few years. 

While most of us would face a dilemma over whether to spend £70 on a new piece of outerwear from Topshop, the moneyed classes spent £250 on average on a new coat last year. 

This is predicted to increase by 27 per cent this autumn, with shoppers spending £286 on their next winter coat.  

Now recession is a distant memory, spending on clothes has risen fast (picture posed by model)

The summer doesn't bring much relief either, with the expected spend on a new bikini rising to £205.

Kalpana Fitzpatrick, founder of MummyMoneyMatters.com said: 'When it comes to spending money, women may well be splashing the cash on designer or high end fashion brands, but women are also better at saving.

'Time and time again, studies have found that women hold the purse strings when it comes to managing the money at home and they are also better at saving and budgeting than their partners.”

'However, although the recession may be a distant memory, many households are still struggling with finances and have not yet achieved a level of comfort they were in pre-recession – so it’s important that people continue to save and budget wisely.'
