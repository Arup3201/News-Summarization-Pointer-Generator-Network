Steph and Dominic Parker have pulled millions of viewers to the Channel 4 show with tipsy commentary from their 16-bedroom home in Sandwich, Kent

The famous living room: Viewers who were hoping to see a spin-off chat show in this room will have to pay more than a licence fee to get a better look

On the market for £3.5m, it was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who created the Cenotaph and Britain's elaborate country manor embassy in Washington

The Parkers use their 3.5-acre home, known as The Salutation, as a bed and breakfast, offering one of the most luxurious stays in the county

Padding to-and-from the overflowing drinks cabinet, the couple bark at everything from the news to Nigella, before glugging another vodka spritz.

As their popularity grew, there has even been talk of the pair hosting a spin-off chat show on that very sofa.

But it appears fans will have to pay a little more than a licence fee to keep the gold-paneled haven in their lives.

On the market for £3.5million, the property known as The Salutation was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who created the Cenotaph and Britain's elaborate country manor embassy in Washington. 

Describing the quality, their B&B's website says: 'Like a fine claret leaving you with a rounded after-taste, our rooms are tailored for the connosieur'

Initially built as a family's country retreat in 1911, Mr and Mrs Parker transformed it into one of the county's most luxurious hotels.

Set within the town and adjacent to the River Stour, surrounded by three-and-a-half acres of garden, the house boasts privacy.

Describing the quality of the surroundings, their website says: 'Like a fine claret leaving you with a rounded after-taste, our rooms are tailored for the connoiseur.'

The property comprises a main house, a secondary house, a coach house, gardener's cottage, and gate house

Demand is soaring for the Sandwich property, which boasts marble kitchen tops and cream-painted walls

The estate was initially built as a country retreat for one family in 1911, but the Parkers have opened their doors, and gained an extensive fan base

THE NEWS: I'm convinced Natasha Kaplinsky accidentally stuck her finger in the electricity socket - her hair was everywhere (Dom)

THE VOICE: I'm slightly in love with Will.i.am. He's funny, clever, quirky and weird (Steph)

MAXINE PEAK: I like to see a ballsy woman on television. I'm married to one in real life (Dom)

DOWNTON ABBEY: I wonder how many windows they've got. We've got 63. (Steph)

The property comprises a main house, a secondary house, a coach house, gardener's cottage, and gate house.

Alongside the 16 bedrooms, it boasts seven reception rooms and 14 bathrooms.

Outside, the grounds cover an area of 
about three and a half acres, with a tropical garden, a kitchen 
garden, a lake and a vegetable garden.

Gertrude Jekyll, a famed horticulturist who formed the other half of a dream team with Lutyens, was called in to help with the gardens - which the Parkers have dubbed the Secret Gardens of Sandwich.

The couple, who met and married in 1998, have two young children and a sausage dog called Gigi.

They bought The Salutation in 2004.

Both worked in property management before joining forces.

Born in Canterbury, Dom Parker, 50, went to agriculture college before setting up his own holiday cottage company in New Forest in the 1980s.

In 1991, he moved back to Canterbury to join the family steel business, but continued to harbour an interest in properties.

Mr Parker told the Kent Messenger: 
'Our lives are changing. We just want to spend more time with the 
children - we want to do something different and move on.

He said: 'We have been planning to do that for a while now and we will just see what happens.

'A chat show is a possibility, we will wait and see - it would be very nice.'

Shrouded in trees and stone walls, the grounds boast privacy. It is set within the town and adjacent to the River Stour

The images released of the home, which the couple bought nine years ago, give a far more extensive glimpse into their lives than we see on TV

The impressive Lutyens property is on the market on Rightmove with estate agent Knight Frank.

Matthew James, Head of Communications 
at Rightmove said: 'If you enjoy having a nosey around other people’s 
houses, you’re going to love looking at one as impressive as this.

'Steph
 and Dom became a hit with viewers of Gogglebox and now that their house
 is for sale on Rightmove, I’m sure it will draw a crowd with those who 
want to see beyond the living room that became so familiar and get a 
deeper insight into the couple’s luxury lifestyle.'
