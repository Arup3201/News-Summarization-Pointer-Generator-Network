Sex worker Maria Duque-Tunjano, aged 48, was found dead in a £2million London apartment

Police investigating the murder of a prostitute in a multi-million-pound apartment block have released a picture of a man they would like to trace.

Maria Duque-Tunjano was found dead in a five-storey white stucco property in London’s Earls Court Square.

Detectives have today said they are looking to locate Robert Richard Fraser, who is also known as Robert Aleem and Shia Robert Jackson, in connection to the death.

The area where the the sex worker was once home to the likes of Bond actress Rosamund Pike and Depeche Mode singer David Gahan.

Police believe the prostitute was using the apartment in the Victorian square, where two bedroom flats fetch upwards of £2million, for her work when she was robbed and bludgeoned to death.

The body of the British sex worker, who lived in Streatham but originally came from Columbia, lain undiscovered for three days in the vice den after she vanished on Tuesday night.

Police weren’t called until Friday lunchtime when they found that a quantity of cash had also been taken from the victim’s bloodied body.

Last night shocked residents living in the mansion block recalled seeing the victim always smiling.

A member of the Earl’s Court Square Garden Committee said she had been made aware of the murder by a neighbour on Friday.

‘It’s very sad. This is usually a safe area.’ Several bunches of flowers and cards were left outside the property last night.’

One message read: ‘To Jenny, I’m so sorry about what happened. Love Koko’.

Miss Duque-Tunjano appears to have also been known as Danielle, according to neighbours and messages left at the scene.

Another card left alongside a bouquet was written in Spanish.

Earls Court Square was historically home to Major Sir William Palliser, an Irish-born politician and inventor and MP for Taunton from 1880 to his death and also Howard Spensley, a British Liberal politician.

The wider area has undergone a renaissance and is now home to the likes of singer Gary Barlow.

Last night forensic police officers were still combing the area.

Police said inquiries had established that the victim was a sex worker who used the flat for her work.

A post-mortem at Westminster Mortuary yesterday gave the cause of death as ‘blunt trauma to the head’.

It is believed she was robbed of a quantity of cash during the fatal assault.

Next of kin have been informed.

Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, of the Met’s Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ‘We have established that Maria was last seen alive on Tuesday January 28.

‘We also understand she was in the company of a man and our primary focus is to trace him as part of this investigation.’

Police are linking the murder to an earlier attack on another sex worker in Paddington on January 18 when a woman was robbed but she escaped without serious injury. No arrests have been made.

The officer added: ‘We have spoken to organisations with links to those who work in the sex industry to make them aware of this incident and pass on the message that personal safety of sex workers is of paramount importance.’
