The company behind Doughnut King and Michel’s Patisserie is set to buy coffee chain Gloria Jean's for $163.5 million from Hillsong board member.

Retail Food Group will buy the global franchising and coffee roasting business from Gloria Jean’s executive chairman Nabi Saleh’s private company.

The store  opened its first Australian outlet in 1996 in Miranda, southern Sydney, when Saleh and Peter Irvine brought Gloria Jean's to Australia.

Saleh, who is also the Hillsong church board member, has committed to remain with the business for a minimum of two years, along with his senior management team.

He said Retail Food Group's reputation as a food and beverage operator and expertise in building franchise businesses made them ideal to lead the continued expansion of Gloria Jean's.

'We have long known that Gloria Jean's Coffees has extraordinary potential for growth, but we couldn't have been more impressed by how quickly RFG recognised this potential,' he said.

'Their reputation as one of Australia's best food and beverage operators, deep expertise in building franchise businesses, and their proven commitment to successfully growing aquired brands, made RFG the ideal choice for the future success of our much'loved Gloria Jean's Coffees brand.'

The 35-year-old cafe group has 800 outlets in more than 40 countries, which includes 358 stores in Australia and 87 in the United States.

The deal comes four months after Singapore-based Global Yellow Pages pulled out of a deal to buy Gloria Jean's. 

Retail Food Group said the global coffee chain had long been a target and will pay $153.5 million in cash plus $10 million in its own shares, plus up to a further $16.4 million depending on Gloria Jean's performance.

Its purchase of Gloria Jean's is expected to be settled by December

It will raise $55 million to help fund its purchase through the issue of new shares to institutional and sophisticated shareholders.

The company has also increased its senior debt facility with National Australia Bank, from $135 million to $253 million.

Its purchase of Gloria Jean's is expected to be settled by December.

It is also buying privately-owned gourmet coffee maker Cafe Palazzo.
