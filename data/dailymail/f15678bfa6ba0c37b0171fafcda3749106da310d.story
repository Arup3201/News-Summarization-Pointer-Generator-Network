This dramatic video shows the moment a Utah woman smashed her SUV into an office building, with the alleged intent of hitting her estranged husband.

Surveillance footage captures 26-year-old Brenda White ramming her Ford Explorer car into the foyer of the building, knocking her ex, John White, to the ground.

He drags himself up and runs for his life, dodging out the way of the car, having been chased through a parking garage and into the building.

Shocking: The SUV smashes through the glass, hitting Mr White

In court: Brenda White said she did not set out to injure her estranged husband

In a 911 recording, obtained by Abc, a distressed-sounding woman can be heard saying: 'This SUV just drove into our building, he's chasing some guy down.

'The car's all the way inside the building. He went through going like 70 miles an hour.'

At the time of the incident the pair were in the midst of an 'ugly divorce' police said. 

Mr White was taken to hospital where 
he was treated for broken legs and given 63 stitches over his legs, arms
and face. Mrs White was arrested and charged with attempted murder.

She was later released on $500,000 bail.

Savage: Mr White is floored by the attack

Injured: Mr White drags himself up off the ground

Mrs White's attorney said she was on a
large amount of anxiety medication and was 'not in her right mind' when
she chased down her former husband.

'On that day, Brenda White's body was behind the wheel of that Ford Explorer,' Jason Schatz said.

'What's in dispute is why this happened.'

On trial: Brenda Christine White faces charges of attempted murder and criminal mischief stemming from the 2006 incident

The
incident happened in 2006 but there have been several appeals because 
her attorneys have tried to use the defense that she was under
extreme emotional distress.

Lawyers argued that she had taken too much Xanax which was partially to blame for the incident.

Rare side-effects of taking the drug can include outbursts of anger, delusions and aggressive behavior.

Mrs White has since apologised for the attack, which she claims not to remember.

Asked what she recalled of the incident she sobbed: 'I don’t. [Being in the parking lot] is the last thing I remember. The next thing I remember, I was inside a building.'

She added: 'It was not me. Jon was my husband. He was my best friend, my lover. I would not want to hurt him,' the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Mrs
White claimed to have blacked out after hearing her former husband 
speaking on a cell phone and telling another woman he loved her. She 
said she had taken a handful of pills on the drive there but had not set
out with the intention of injuring him.

'At some point 
in our lives we have all done or said something that we wouldn't have 
done if we were in total control of our body,' Mr Schatz added.

In his testimony White said he ran from the parking garage when he saw his ex-wife in the SUV.

He said he dodged between two parked cars, jumping over a concrete wall, and into the office.

At that point, he testified, his ex-wife smashed through the glass and into the building, knocking him to the ground.

After being struck he was still able 
to get up and continue to run but she drove down a hallway and chased 
him, hitting him again.

Long process: White's attorneys have pushed for appeals over the past six years, arguing that she was 'not in her right mind' because she had taken too much Xanax before the attack

He said he hid in a closet until a maintenance man found him.

Mr White claimed that before the attack, during his lunch break, Mrs White came to his office and played the song Angry Johnny by the singer and songwriter Poe, which includes the lyrics: 'I wanna kill you/I wanna blow you away.'

When that lyric came up, she mimicked a gun with her hands and pointed it at his head, he claimed.

If convicted Brenda White faces up to five years in jail.
