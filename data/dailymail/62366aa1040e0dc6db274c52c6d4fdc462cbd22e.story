Spotted: This image shows Barbara Jean BJ Geardello, age 53, and her 56-year-old boyfriend, Robert Deyell out for a walk on Tuesday morning

Police in West Virginia had to respond to a bizarre incident on Tuesday morning when members of the public called in to say they had seen a naked man being walked on a leash by a woman in a purple nightgown.

The man was wearing a hood over his head, his ankles were bound  and Lt. Nelson Croft of the Sheriff's Office in Ohio County, West Virginia called it the 'Weirdest day ever. Yep, I hope it is the weirdest day ever.'

After a passing motorist took a picture and alerted police, officers began knocking on doors and eventually came to an apartment where a woman identified as Barbara Jean 'BJ' Geardello, 53 admitted it was her and boyfriend, Robert Deyell, 56, out for a walk.

'The female at first denied any involvement,' Lt. Croft said to CBS Pittsburgh.

'We had a witness positively identify her, and she admitted it, as did the male.'

'They
 said it was consensual sex, a consensual sex game, and they were 
offended that people were stopping and calling them freaks,' Lt. Croft.

Deyell, told deputies he was not seriously injured, says Lt. Croft.

'Except for ligature marks, obvious ligature marks on his feet and ankles,' he added.

'Other than that, he denied any injury. We won’t go into the other thing.'
