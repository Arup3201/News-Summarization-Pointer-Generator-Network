'Just what does one do with the thousands of bunches of flowers one receives?'

It's a perennial problem for the Queen, but a possible solution may have been found in the shape of a super-sized flowerpot made in her own image.

The 11ft high tub has been created to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee anniversary and takes pride of place next to a similarly sized pot in the image of Prince Philip.

Each terracotta tub weighs more than half a tonne and the pair took a team of sculptors more than two months to make.

Flower power: The images of the Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh have been turned into giant terracotta pots to be displayed at venues around London

Trimming down: The two terracotta pots weigh in at half a tonne each and contain 50 different varieties of flowers including geraniums, hydrangeas and fresias

The 'Royal bouquet' contains more than 100 different varieties of flowers and cost more than £10,000 to put together.

Flowers featured include orchids, roses, ivy, daisies, fuchsias, gerberas, geraniums, perennials, ferns, conifers and moss.

The pots, which are nearly twice the 
height of the Queen, are being displayed outside Buckingham Palace and 
other iconic London landmarks today.

The unique sculptures will be 
presented to the royal couple in June - and their creators hope the pair
will be pleased with the designs.

They might find a permanent home in Buckingham Palace where 
perhaps the Queen's green-fingered son Prince Charles might offer to 
water them from time to time.

Gardeners need a stepladder to give the colourful contents of the Queen’s pot a Royal trim,

The flowerpots were commissioned by TV shopping channel QVC as it launches its gardening season.

QVC’s
head gardener Richard Jackson explained: “We wanted to create something
spectacular to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, which would also 
inspire Brits to think creatively about their own gardens.

“We hope the Queen and Duke are royally amused by their floral selves.”
