Ken Clarke vowed to carry on ‘chillaxing’ yesterday, as he brushed aside photos of him in repose.

The 71-year-old defended his decision to ‘steal a day off’ to watch the cricket at Trent Bridge on Monday, where he was photographed with one shoe off, yawning heavily.

David Cameron has faced criticism over claims he likes to ‘chillax’ by playing computer games and tennis, but Mr Clarke said: ‘Nobody’s going to stop me chillaxing on a hot afternoon every now and again.’

'If we’re to get through this very difficult matter of when spies give evidence, how they give evidence and even bigger matters of how we get out of this financial crisis back to normality – which will take several years of effort I shall have to spread out on the balcony of Trent Bridge a few more times I think.’

In a new biography of David Cameron an aide is quoted as saying: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for "chillaxing", he would win it,' meanwhile his friend and US President Barack Obama told reporters earlier this month he had sneaked out of a NATO summit so he could go sightseeing in Chicago.

Stung by revelations about his leisure pursuits, he was forced to insist he was ‘completely dedicated’ to the job of Prime Minister and was as 'driven' as Margaret Thatcher, who was famous for her dedication and extremely long working hours.

Today Mr Clarke has also admitted that he is 'amazed' the Government is not more disliked by Britain and that they would never win a general election if it was held now.

Returning to work today after watching England thrash the West Indies, he said that despite doing 'unpopular things' now he had been in governments 'having much more trouble' than this one.

'I have seen, midterm, much greater turmoil than this,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'I've been in governments having much more trouble than this. Actually I am amazed that the Government is retaining the support it is.'

And in an attack on Eurosceptic MPs calling for an in-out referendum he referred to them as 'a few extreme nationalist politicians'.

'The nation is extremely worried about present events, as well we might be. We all feel insecure, we all feel worried, we are hoping that a strong government will take us through and some difficult measures are required,' he said.

'The idea that they are all demanding a referendum on the European Union would be regarded as ridiculous, it would be out of sight as a public priority.

'It is the demand of a few right-wing journalists and a few extreme nationalist politicians.'

A referendum would 'throw absolute confusion' over Britain's links to the EU and damage the economy, he said, adding: 'I can't think of anything sillier to do.'.

'Particularly it would settle nothing with the more frenzied Euro-sceptics who keep believing that European bogies are under the bed.'
