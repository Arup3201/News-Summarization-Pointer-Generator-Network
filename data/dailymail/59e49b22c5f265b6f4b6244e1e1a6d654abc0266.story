Rene Meulensteen says Louis van Gaal could live to regret selling Danny Welbeck to Arsenal, and believes the England striker will be a hit at the Emirates.

The former Manchester United assistant manager coached Welbeck from the age of eight at Manchester United, but left the club last season when Sir Alex Ferguson retired.

Welbeck should make his first Arsenal appearance on Saturday against Manchester City, fresh from scoring twice for England against Switzerland on Monday.

Speaking to talkSPORT, Meulensteen said: 'I had him from when he was 8, 9 years of age and I think the best of Danny is yet to come.

'He is a very versatile player and I’m 100 per cent sure he will do very, very well for Arsenal. Danny is a perfect match for Arsenal. He is such a versatile player.

'He is very good in short, creative, combination play, showing for the ball, passing and moving, picking up different positions. At the same time he has the pace and power to break away if they break from their own half. I think he is a really good match.'

Welbeck played 142 times for Manchester United, scoring 29 times, but he may be needed to lead the line as a centre forward for Arsenal with Olivier Giroud injured. Meulensteen believes he wasn't played in his best position at Old Trafford.

'No, definitely not. You look back through the history of Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and we were always keen on bringing young players through and giving them a chance.

'People keep saying about Danny Welbeck not scoring enough goals but you have to look at the people with him and in front of him and how many games has he really played in his preferred position?

'Every player that wants to builds up his confidence needs a run of games in his position and when that happens you get a flow and you keep reproducing the same performances. That has not happened yet for Danny unfortunately.'
