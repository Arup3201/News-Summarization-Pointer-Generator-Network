Ally McCoist has told his Rangers players to blot out the latest round of off-field headlines ahead of Saturday’s Championship clash with Hearts.

The Ibrox side could slide nine points behind the Championship leaders if they lose at Tynecastle. They travel east against a backdrop of 10 job cuts among administrative staff at the club, fresh calls from former director Dave King for fans to starve the club of cash and former owner Craig Whyte facing a warrant for his arrest.

‘I keep saying to the players the only thing they should concentrate on are the things they can affect,’ McCoist told Talksport. ‘That’s results.

‘To a man, they have come in and trained their socks off and are a great bunch of boys.

‘It can be difficult for them at times because it’s been on the front page of the paper for the last three years - more, sadly, than it has been on the back. But there is nothing we can do about that. All we can do is give the supporters something to cheer about and that’s via results on the park.’

After the dismal 1-1 home draw with Alloa, McCoist is likely to face further calls for his head if Hearts stretch their lead at the top, but he claimed to be savouring a trip to Tynecastle.

‘Outside Ibrox it’s probably my favourite ground in the country. The atmosphere is as good as anywhere,’ he said. ‘If we get the result it’s a great win for us and that’s all we are thinking about.’

Warning once again that a League Cup semi-final with Celtic is secondary to promotion, McCoist added: ‘We have absolutely got to put the semi-final on the backburner. You probably won’t believe I am saying this, but that semi-final against Celtic is secondary to us getting out of the division.’

Meanwhile, the war of words between businessman King and the Ibrox hierarchy continued last night.

Rangers chairman David Somers has claimed King’s failure to provide proof of funds and identify members of his consortium had made it impossible to accept his offer of investment in the club.

King subsequently claimed proof of funds was available ‘immediately’ but that Sandy Easdale, chairman of the Rangers football board, had agreed the information could be provided once the backing of shareholders was confirmed.

This was denied by Easdale last night in a statement which read: ‘I am 100 per cent supportive of the stance taken by David Somers. David had a legal and regulatory duty to determine the legitimacy of Mr King’s offer. Any suggestion on Mr King’s part that I had agreed that these contentious issues could be dealt with after an acceptance of his bid are inaccurate and misleading.

‘The suggestion that Mr King could not proceed further because my shareholding and proxies would have blocked his bid is a nonsense. For a bid to be rejected it has to be received first. I can only conclude Mr King’s phantom bid was designed as a vehicle for self-promotion of some kind. Unfortunately the consequences of his inaccurate and ill-advised statement serves further to destabilise the club and upsets the fan base at this very sensitive time. I have grown tired of Mr King’s antics.’

Brian Kennedy also released a statement revealing he wanted Ibrox given legal protection as part of his £3m loan offer.

The Sale Sharks owner’s proposal was turned down by the board, with Somers claiming they opted for a £2m loan from Mike Ashley because he wanted less interest and security in return.

Somers’ words have now prompted Kennedy to detail the rival nine-point terms he put forward with his money last month.

Those included a request for ‘Ibrox Stadium to be protected in a Trust or a similar Legal mechanism that would allow this asset to be used solely for RFC in whatever legal entity to play football in perpetuity.’ Kennedy also wanted former director Paul Murray appointed to the plc board for 24 months - and the right to appoint an administrator if Rangers tipped into another insolvency. Kennedy was requesting a three per cent interest rate but it’s understood he was willing to negotiate this down towards zero.

He added: ‘The loan (of which £1m had been provided by Mr George Letham) was designed to give the Board of Rangers PLC the time needed to pursue Dave King’s offer and/or a new share issue in order to ensure long term financial security for the business.

‘Furthermore the appointment of Paul Murray would provide much needed harmony between the Board and the supporters.

‘I was informed by Mr Somers the Board had no objections to any of these terms. He later informed me he had made the decision to go with Mr Ashley’ s offer after consultation with the Major Shareholders. This is their prerogative.’
