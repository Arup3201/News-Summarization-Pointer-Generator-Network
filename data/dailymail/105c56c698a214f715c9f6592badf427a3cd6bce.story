Diego Costa is expected to start for Chelsea at Manchester United on Sunday despite his hamstring problems and an overnight stay in hospital last week with a virus.

Manager Jose Mourinho has been sweating on the Spain striker's fitness but Costa is understood to have come through training on Saturday and is ready to be selected.

Mourinho had said Costa  would have to train with the team and show no ill effects from his recent health scares if he was to start - and the Premier League’s leading goalscorer seems to have done enough to convince Mourinho he can play.

That comes as a major boost to Chelsea, who are without injured France forward Loic Remy and would have relied on 36-year-old Didier Drogba to lead the line.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has his own selection headache up front. Wayne Rooney completes a ban and Radamel Falcao is doubtful after Van Gaal revealed he took a heavy knock in training on Friday. Robin van Persie has scored just twice in eight league games this season.

Another concern for Van Gaal is that Angel Di Maria, in outstanding form, has a thigh strain, although the Argentina flier is confident he will be fit.

Chelsea are missing Cesar Azpilicueta, who is suspended, but Ramires could return after a month on the sidelines.
