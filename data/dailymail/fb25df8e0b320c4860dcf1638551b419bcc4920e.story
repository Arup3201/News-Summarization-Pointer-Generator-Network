Its moments of high drama usually involve burnt cakes or ‘soggy bottoms’.

So viewers of The Great British Bake Off were understandably shocked when the BBC2 show turned into a ‘bloodbath’ worthy of Casualty.

One of the star contestants, 23-year-old John Whaite from Manchester, was forced to withdraw from the strudel round after slicing his finger on an electric mixer.

Shocked: John Whaite cut himself while trying to bake a strudel on The Great British Bakeoff on BBC2

But instead of passing tactfully over the incident, producers treated the show’s dedicated fans to close-up shots of his blood-soaked hand.

Some took to Twitter to complain. One said: ‘I greatly dislike the sight of blood. Great British Bake Off was rank. Blood glove. Eew.’

Another said: ‘Did not expect to see blood on The Great British Bake Off. Not hungry any more,’ while a third simply called it a ‘bloodbath’.

In a tense climax, Mr Whaite – who has a strong female following – was spared elimination, with the judges deciding to vote off two contestants next week instead.

The accident happened halfway through Tuesday night’s episode, as contestants competed in the ‘showstopper challenge’, set by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood.

As he made his strudel, Mr Whaite was seen wearing a blue glove on his right hand.

He explained: ‘I’m having to start again because I stupidly – it’s my own fault – I put my finger in the Magimix and just slid it across the blade. It’s just knocked me off balance a little but I’ll be all right.’

Soon, however, the law student was forced to sit down as blood filled the glove and began pouring down his arm. Looking increasingly pale, he said: ‘I need to wash it. I keep on feeling dizzy.’

As the cameras showed a close-up of his cut, host Sue Perkins provided a rather vivid  running commentary.

Miss Perkins said: ‘John’s been soldiering on with a cut finger, but it’s deeper than first feared, and stretching the pastry has stretched the wound.’

She added: ‘Luckily there is a doctor in the marquee. Danny [Bryden, another contestant] is an intensive care consultant.’

Despite begging to be allowed to continue, Mr Whaite was led off for treatment.

He later returned with his arm in a sling, saying: ‘I’m just so gutted because I really think my strudel’s going to be amazing.’
