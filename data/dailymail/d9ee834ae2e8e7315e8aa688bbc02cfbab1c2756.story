Meteorologist Kirk Waite said temperatures could hit 24C in some parts of the country by the middle of next week.

He said: 'The settled weather is really down to high pressure which is currently centred across Scandinavia. We have had a block develop across our area meaning all the wet and windy weather you can sometimes get towards autumn is not able to make any progress in towards the UK.
