The Prince of Wales indulged his inner super-sleuth with a visit to GCHQ Scarborough today, to celebrate the centenary of the oldest continually operating signals intelligence station in the world.

The Prince unveiled a plaque commemorating the occasion and dedicating new accommodation facilities at the site.

Charles was then given a tour of the site, including an exhibition of items from the site’s Second World War bunker, which was in operation until the 70s.

Among the items on display was the famous Enigma encryption machine, invented by a German and used by Britain's codebreakers as a way of deciphering German signals traffic during World War Two.

Charles was given a demonstration of how the machine worked, as well as an account of the crucial role Scarborough played in the tracking of the famous German battleship the Bismarck, prior to its sinking in 1941.

She also met one of her grandmother’s colleagues, Lady Marion Body.

Marion, who worked with Miss Glassborow and her twin sister Mary in Hut 16, was part of the team of crack code breakers who unlocked the secrets of the German Enigma machine - ultimately helping to win the war for Britain.

A patron of the intelligence services, this was Prince Charles’s first visit to GCHQ’s North Yorkshire site, which now works to stop serious crime and cyber threats.

‘It is a real pleasure for us to host a visit by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to our Scarborough site in this centenary year so that he can meet staff and see first-hand the vital work they do in keeping the country safe’, said a GCHQ spokesperson.

‘The Prince has long been a strong supporter of the work of the intelligence agencies and his presence here today is a reminder of that.’
