They're a horrid pest that's been spreading across that country since the 1930s, with more than 200 million believed to be on the ground destroying native species and damaging the environment.

But could the struggle to control them be as easy as getting the creatures on our menus?

Professor Phillip Hayward from the Southern Cross University thinks so, and says the toads are actually a really good source of protein.

Prof Hayward is doing his latest research of how we can eat these 'ghastly evasives', as he describes them, and says a regulated industry in Australia would not just provide an economic benefit but also health benefits.

Could we eat this guy? Apparently so. A Sydney researcher says eating the pest and exporting them is a way of the future

'Cane Toads are a good source of export product, there are huge interest from countries like China to export them, it could be a tangible export product.'

He said currently many parts of East Asia and France eat frogs and numbers are starting to dwindle so an export industry in cane toads would be vastly beneficial for Australia, because we has so many.

The toads are also in high demand in some countries where they extract the poison to be used in medical procedures.

INGREDIENTS

* 8 Toad legs with skin removed

* 2 tablespoons of butter

* 3 cloves of garlic

* Chives 

* Salt and pepper to taste

METHOD

Melt butter in a heavy based sauce pan and fry garlic until soft. Add toad legs and cook in butter until tender. Lightly toast a baguette. Serve two toad legs on a piece of baguette, drizzled with garlic butter and garnished with chives. 

'Internationally China have started to show interest because they were unaware we have a massive supply market of them.'

And as far as eating them goes, it's a no brainer.

'It is a food source that you don't have to farm because of the masses in Australia and it's increasing, the source is already made,' said Prof Hayward.

'The fact is they're threatening our species and we know that mobilising people to kill them doesn't work in the short term.'

There are more than 200 million Cane Toads populating Australia and that number is increasing rapidly

Prof Hayward who has eaten his fair share of frogs legs in Asia believes eating Cane Toads is the way to go and will present his case to Australian cuisine at a regional food conference in Byron Bay later this month.

Professor Phillip Hayward says we need to start exporting Cane Toads as products and eating them

'Like any other frog meat, it's a bland meat but it is healthy with a good source of omega 3 and picks up marinade well.'

He particularly likes a nice stir fried Cane Toad and admits it goes best with sesame oil and ginger. 

'30 to 40 years ago, we never thought we'd be eating raw fish in large quantities in Australia but now we do, we just need cultural attitudes to change and we can get it into a niche market.'

'To get it into the commercial market we need to look at the viability and how we can prepare it to not get poisoned, practises need to be right and then we can start,' he said.

'But it really is quite easy to get poison out of Cane Toads.'

'You simply have to kill them quickly as to not stress them out and remove their legs and skin and wash them.'

'The poor Cane Toad has an image problem, the poison is only in the shoulder area the legs are fine.'

And while he doesn't see the idea of eating Cane Toads in Australia becoming a massively popular craze, he believes we need to embrace it.

'It really is a dream product, it's a winner on every front.' 

A group in the Northern Territory called GULP NT - which stands for growing and understanding local produce have promoted cooking up and eating Cane Toads.

On their blog, they said friends of the organisation which live outside Darwin have always been keen on experimenting with the cooking of road kill, including snakes and wallabies and also had an interest in the use of these ugly toads as food.

INGREDIENTS

* 8 toad legs with skins removed

* 4-5 knuckles of galangal

* Finley chopped 3 leaves of Thai coriander 

* Finely chopped 2 large handfuls of kang kung 

* 1 teaspoon sesame seed oil

* Splash of soy sauce Salt

* Salt and pepper 

METHOD

Heat sesame seed oil in a wok on a medium heat. Fry toad legs for a couple minutes, add galangal and coriander, season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes stirring continuously. Add kang kung and mix with plash of soy sauce until stems cooked. 

They included several recipes which have been tired and tested by the GULP team including Cane Toad marinated in soy, ginger, garlic and chilli.

How about a salad of toad legs with Kang Kung and Galangal and canapes with garlic butter?

They also suggested the most humane way to catch them was by the back legs and whip them into a dark airtight canoe bag and then freeze them.

GULP says you don't want to stress them out so just pop them in the freezer and when you want to cook them, thaw them out and take a meat clever to chop off their legs.
