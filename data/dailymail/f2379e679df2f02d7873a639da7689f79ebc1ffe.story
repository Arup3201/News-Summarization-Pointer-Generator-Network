A former Bega Cheese boss and convicted paedophile has apologised for his crimes,  telling a court he 'just wasn't able to resist the urge'.

Businessman Maurice Van Ryn abused children aged from eight to 16 between 2004 and 2014 around the Bega area in southern NSW.

Van Ryn provided evidence at a sentencing hearing at Downing Centre Court on Thursday, saying he had experienced sexual thoughts about children for most of his life. 

When the opportunity to prey on children presented itself, 'I just wasn't able to resist that urge that hit me at that moment,' he said, according to the Nine Network.

The revelations have placed an enormous amount of stress on Van Ryn's family, he told a court today

He described his actions as 'stupid' and told the court revelations of his crimes have placed stress on his family.

Van Ryn previously pleaded guilty to five counts of indecent assault, five of indecency and one assault with indecency. 

He also pleaded guilty to the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. 

At a previous hearing, his lawyer told the court Van Ryn was undergoing treatment to reduce his testosterone levels in a process also known as chemical castration.

Van Ryn told the court on Thursday that his thoughts had 'disappeared overnight' since the treatment, according to a Radio 2UE report.  

His sentencing will continue on April 20.
