China has employed two million people to keep an eye on its citizens' internet use, it is claimed.

The workers are paid by the government and private businesses to monitor the tens of millions of online posts made by Chinese users every day, according to state media.

Their main targets are social media and blogging sites, which have proved difficult for the country's notoriously controlling authorities.

The workers - hired as 'internet opinion analysts' - are scouring sites such as popular microblog Weibo, according to government-run Bejing News.

By performing simple keyword searches, they are able to monitor the vast number of comments and images posted online every day.

They are believed to be supported
by technology which can analyse millions of posts an hour - both in and outside China.

The exact number of staff employed by the Chinese government to trawl the internet in search of criticism or dissent has long been a source of speculation.

The countryâ€™s communist authorities are said to be terrified that relaxing their grip could result in unrest or political change.

Many websites freely available in the 
west, such as Google Maps and Facebook, have been banned by the 
Chinese government, which insists on vetting any sites that wish to operate in 
the country.

Developers from all over the world have tried to liberate the country's 
online policy - known as 'the great firewall of China' - by creating tools which allow users inside the country to 
bypass 'the wall' and see content they would be able to in the outside 
world.

However, it was revealed yesterday that Apple have been accused of kowtowing to
the government after pulling a program from its China App 
store which allowed users to bypass the country's strict internet 
controls.

The free app, called Open Door,
could be used by Chinese people to randomise their IP to keep their 
browsing information private and prevent them form being directed to 
censored content.

It 
was being sold on Apple's Chinese version of the App Store until July 
this year, when it was pulled by the Californian computer giant who said
that it contained 'illegal content'.

The tech giant has reportedly confirmed that the app had been banned because it contained content which was illegal in China, and that developers have to abide by laws in the country they wish to sell their software.
