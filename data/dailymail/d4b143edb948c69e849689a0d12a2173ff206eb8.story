A vampire slaying kit complete with guns, axes, wooden stakes and crucifixes is among hundreds of creepy items up for sale in a New Jersey auction.

The 19th century kit, which has been constructed inside a wooden coffin, has been given a starting bid of $5,000 at the 'Danse Macabre' (dance of death) sale in Closter later this month.

In addition to the old-fashioned weaponry, it includes a religious book, vials of holy water, garlic and salt, and other items needed to slaughter a blood-sucking monster.

For sale: This vampire slaying kit is among hundreds of creepy items up for sale in a New Jersey auction

Weaponry: The 19th century kit is complete with old guns, axes (pictured) wooden stakes and crucifixes

To deter a vampire: It also includes a religious book and small jars of holy water, garlic and salt (pictured)

Chilling: The kit, which also contains intricately carved wooden stakes (left), has been given a starting bid of $5,000 at an auction in Closter, New Jersey. Right, another item in the sale, a Japanese demon mask

A creepy buy: The kit's exterior (pictured) resembles a wooden coffin - and its interior is just as creepy

Although particularly striking to look at, the kit is not the only one available for potential vampire slayers to buy. Another smaller kit, featuring silver crucifixes and wooden stakes, is also on sale.

Meanwhile, a voodoo box from the 1800s - complete with 'hexing paraphernalia', a human skull, a wax doll and chilling photos of infants from post-mortem records - will appear at the auction.

The box, along with many of the auction's other items, was collected by Mark Falk, 'a mild-mannered U.S. government employee' who had a secret obsession with the occult and macabre.

After his death, Falk's home was found brimming with objects related to 'death, post mortems, voodoo, vampires, medical quackery, gruesome tribal knives'.

Antique: A selection of four African throwing knives featuring engraved blades and wrapped handles

'By day, Mark Falk was a government worker who went to church regularly and played music as a hobby,' said auction house owner, Stephen D'Atr, of Sterling Associates in New Jersey.

'All of his friends say he was a wonderful, interesting guy. What made him different was that he also had a fascination with death.' 

Other items up for sale include taxidermy insects (such as tarantulas), historic music sheets from famous composers, a Japanese demon mask, African throwing knives and human bones.

Regal: Another item up for sale is this regimental silver-mounted Gurkha kukri with Royal Cypher of Queen Elizabeth II. Its rear pouch contains two horn-handle knives.

Music: This collection of six antique music journals with music from various composers is also up for sale

'There is a human foot, a hand, a female pelvis and a partial skull, it really creeps you out,' said Mr D'Atr.
