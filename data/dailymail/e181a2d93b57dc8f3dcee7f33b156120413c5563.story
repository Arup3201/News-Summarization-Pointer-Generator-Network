Hospital bosses had to declare an ‘internal emergency’ and turn away ambulances from a packed A&E unit – weeks after they closed a nearby emergency department.

Doctors at Barnet Hospital in North London had to shut their doors to ambulance patients on January 31 this year – only to do the same thing again just two days later.

According to a leaked letter, ‘capacity issues’ in the hospital’s A&E forced ambulances to be sent elsewhere.

Struggle: Doctors at Barnet Hospital were forced to declare an 'internal emergency' shutting their doors to ambulances after being swamped by patients

The two incidents follow the controversial closure last December of Chase Farm Hospital’s A&E six miles away, which has heaped pressure on nearby hospitals.

Last night, a spokesman for Barnet And Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust denied the diversions were caused by the A&E downgrade, adding: ‘The Trust experienced high numbers of attendances and ambulance arrivals to A&E on 31 January. 

‘As a consequence of this, and in line with NHS England policy, Barnet Hospital declared an internal emergency and... non-urgent ambulances were diverted.’

She added that diverts, as they are known, were not unusual and that there were 19 in total across England that weekend.

But angry campaigners claim the A&E closure is ‘putting lives at risk’, while local MP Nick de Bois said that hospital managers had serious questions to answer.

Dozens of A&Es across the country are under threat, as the Government and some doctors argue that the NHS cannot afford to have an emergency unit in every hospital.

Critics have warned of the knock-on effects of the closures, which can force seriously ill patients to travel further to receive treatment – and then face more delays once they get there.

Downgrade: Chase Farm Hospital's A&E was controversially closed. It is six miles from Barnet Hospital, heaping pressure on the North London trust's emergency department

Paramedics say the Chase Farm closure has led to a dramatic increase in ‘stacking’ at North London hospitals, where ambulances have to queue to drop off patients.

‘I have always said the downgrade was 
the wrong decision, because the demands of the local population would 
lead to problems at other A&Es.

Official NHS statistics bear this out, showing the number of ambulances waiting for more than 30 minutes outside one hospital has risen seven-fold.

Last week, NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson said that ‘centralised, large units... work best’ and warned that the NHS could not afford to keep smaller departments open.

But Kate Wilkinson, of the Save Chase Farm campaign group, said: ‘This has become a very dangerous situation where there are not sufficient front-line services to deal with demand. It’s putting lives at risk. There needs to be some serious and honest discussions with the decision makers, who need to admit there is a lack of services.’

Last month, this newspaper revealed how two-year old Hashir Naveed died  after his desperate mother took him to Chase Farm at 3am – only to discover that its A&E department had recently been closed down.

Two weeks later managers declared an ‘internal major incident due to capacity issues in Emergency’ at Barnet Hospital with ‘ambulances queuing’, according to a letter to GPs.

East of England Ambulance Service was asked ‘to ensure that alternative hospitals are utilised’ and GPs were told not to send in patients ‘where possible’.

Stacking: The closure of Chase Farm's A&E has also heaped pressure on North Middlesex University Hospital, where 34 extra ambulances have flocked to the trust every day since the closure

The crisis in Barnet’s A&E on January 31 was triggered by there being ‘no beds available’ for admitted patients to move into, wrote Jacqui Bunce, associate director of East and North Hertfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group. Two days later a similar thing happened and ambulances had to be sent elsewhere.

Last winter, when Chase Farm A&E was still open, ambulances never had to be diverted from either hospital.

NHS statistics also show that since Chase Farm A&E closed on December 9, ambulances have had to wait outside Barnet Hospital for more than 30 minutes on 236 occasions.

Over the same two-month period  last winter, that happened only 167 times – and then the figures related to ambulances outside both hospitals, not just Barnet.

However, the increase in stacking outside North Middlesex Hospital has been far more startling.

Since Chase Farm A&E closed, ambulances have had to wait over 30 minutes on 941 separate occasions – or 14 times a day. During the same two-month period last winter, this only happened 132 times – or twice a day.

Dangerous situation: Nick de Bois, Tory MP for Enfield North, said: 'Before Chase Farm A&E closed we were repeatedly told that capacity at Barnet would not be an issue. These early indications suggest that clearly they cannot. I have always said the downgrade was the wrong decision'

North Middlesex board minutes show concern over the issue with the hospital receiving 34 extra ambulances a day since the closure, ‘compared to an expectation of 29’.

This has led to ‘some clustering of ambulances which has caused some pressures on the flow of patients in to and through hospital’, wrote director Martin Armstrong.

Ambulance crews are meant to hand over patients within 15 minutes of arriving but performance on this is ‘significantly below target’.

A North Middlesex spokesman said that, as a result of the changes that included the Chase Farm downgrade, it was expected the hospital would see an extra 26,000 patients a year.

Nick de Bois, Tory MP for Enfield North, said: ‘Before Chase Farm A&E closed we were repeatedly told that capacity at Barnet would not be an issue and they would be able to cope. These early indications suggest that clearly they cannot.

‘I have always said the downgrade was the wrong decision, because the demands of the local population would lead to problems at other A&Es.

‘When you have got ambulances stacking up outside the doors of North Mid to that extent, it does beg the question: Why are we downgrading other emergency departments?’

Two-thirds of the public oppose plans for a new NHS database that will see details from confidential medical records being sold to companies, a poll has found.

Within weeks, GPs will be forced to hand over medical records, including sensitive information such as mental health diagnoses, to build the database.

Last month it emerged that four in ten doctors intended to opt their own records out of the care.data project.

Now an online poll of 1,161 adults  by YouGov has found widespread opposition among the public. When asked if they would ‘support or oppose’ proposals to allow firms  to access the database in exchange  for a fee, 65 per cent said they  were against the idea.

Retired GP Dr Ron Singe said: ‘The Government needs to explain who is going to get access to this data, for what purpose and for how much.’

Martin Caldwell, of pressure group SumOfUs.org, which commissioned the poll, said: ‘The consequences for ordinary people could be huge. 

‘It’s not hard to imagine the value  of this information to the likes  of insurance companies, banks  or marketing firms.’
