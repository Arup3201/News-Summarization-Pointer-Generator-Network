The world's largest auction house Christie's saw record sales of £3.9billion last year, boosted by a growing demand in contemporary art.

The London-based auction house saw sales of works by post-war and living artists grow 33 per cent in 2012, as it set a company record for the third successive year.

Among the works behind last year's boom for the company, which saw sales rise by ten per cent on last year, was Mark Rothko's Orange, Red, Yellow, which fetched a record £53.8m, and Claude Monet's Nympheas, which sold for $43m.

Francis Bacon's 'Portrait of Henrietta Moraes' was among the works which helped boost Christie's sales by ten per cent in 2012

Steven Murphy, the first American to head the auctioneer since its creation in 1766, said the key to future success relied on a broad pool of art lovers.

The 58-year-old said: 'One of the things that is driving the opportunity for a company like Christie's is cultural.

'There is a huge cultural surge around the world toward the experience of art.

'Museum attendance is way up on the previous year and the year before that... People are accessing art on their iPads, on their laptops, on their iPhones.'

The overall increase in 2012 came despite a slump in Christie's auction sales of Asian art, which fell by a quarter to £415m after providing the engine for growth in recent years.

Competition from Chinese auctioneers and the end to a speculative bubble in some Asian art contributed to the decline, but Mr Murphy said the region had the potential to grow again longer term.

In contrast, Christie's saw private sales surge 26 per cent to £631m, and Mr Murphy expected deals behind closed doors to be key in maintaining growth in 2013 and beyond.

He said: 'Look for a big increase in our private sales activity.

'Our current clients want to do more of that.'

A key part of Mr Murphy's strategy since arriving has been to build its online presence, both by attracting visitors to the website and encouraging them to bid over the internet.

From six online-only auctions in 2012, the company will hold more than 30 in 2013, and while digital sales tend to be for more modestly priced items, Edward Hopper's 'October on Cape Cod' sold for $9.6 million to an internet bidder in November.

By expanding its online presence, Christie's aims to capture more business in the mid to lower-tier markets, away from the multi-million-dollar deals that grab the headlines.

Murphy pointed to a 20 per cent rise in sales at Christie's South Kensington offices, which specialise in lower-end art and antiques.
