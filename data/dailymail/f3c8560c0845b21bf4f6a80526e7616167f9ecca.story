If Phil Collins has taught us anything, it is that You Can't Hurry Love - especially when its a love of collecting historical artifacts from a Wild West battle almost 180 years ago.

After spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the Battle of the Alamo, the Genesis singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a Texas museum.

The 63-year-old Genesis singer-drummer joked he'd spent 'all the money that I made from music' on 200-plus pieces related to the battle where 1,500 Mexican troops laid siege to 200 Texans in 1836.

Homecoming: Collins made the announcement under the shadow of the Alamo itself in Texas

'Some people would buy Ferraris, some 
people would buy houses, I bought old bits of metal and old bits of 
paper,' Collins said.

'It's at my home, in my basement in Switzerland. I
 look at it every day, but no one else was enjoying it.'

On Thursday, Collins stood outside the Alamo as he announced plans to donate his vast collection to the Texas museum.

Collins
 has been an Alamo aficionado since growing up in London and watching 
actor Fess Parker portray Davy Crockett in 1955 Disney miniseries, 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier'.

The series chronicled the frontier legend of Crockett, who eventually died as one of the defenders of the Alamo.

The last surviving roll from the Alamo is included in the artifacts being donated to the Texas museum

'I've
 had a love affair with this place since I was about 5 years old,' said 
Collins, who sweated in a button-down shirt and spectacles before a 
cheering crowd of dignitaries and tourists who gathered in front of the 
Alamo for the occasion.

'It was something that I used to go and play in 
the garden with my soldiers,' he said.

Collins
 said his favorite artifact was also his first, purchased for him in the
 1990s by his then-wife: a receipt for the sale of the saddle of John W.
 Smith, an Alamo messenger who rode through Mexican lines and pleaded 
for reinforcements before the battle.

The
 collection also includes a rifle owned by Crockett, his leather shot 
pouch and a pair of powder horns Crockett is believed to have given to a
 Mexican officer before his death — as well as muskets and musket balls 
that belonged to Mexican soldiers.

Phil Collins says he has been obsessed with Davy Crockett since he was a child

Last stand: The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (pictured: a painting of the battle which hangs at the museum)

Lifelong passion: Collins, 63, said he became fascinated with the Alamo story when he was growing up in the 1950s watching the television series 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier' starring Fess Parker (right) as the eponymous hero (pictured with co-star Buddy Ebsen)

Collins said he first visited the famed battle site while on tour with his band in 1973. Each band member was allowed to pick one place in the U.S. trip - and he chose the Alamo.

'I was just spellbound when I first saw 
it in person,' he recalled. 'Having lived all my life, to see it in 
books and movies and the pictures in magazines, it was really quite 
extraordinary.'

His decision to donate the items to the Alamo was because he wanted the collection - which he is still adding to - to be kept together, Texas Monthly reported.

'It doesn’t end my involvement with Texas history. It’s my intention to keep accumulating, keep collecting, and once I’ve lived with whatever I buy for a month, I’ll be shipping it here.

'I’m kind of a bit of a magnet now for things relating to the Texas revolution,' he said.

Collins has agreed to ship the collection to Texas, but on the proviso that the museum updates the site and constructs a new building to house the collection.

Phil Collins has written a book, The Alamo and Beyond, about his collection of artifacts

Helmets and explosive devices, which Collins has collected over the years, have been donated to a museum

Letters and other paperwork related to the Alamo are included in the donation

Cherished: For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events and has been re-enacted in film on numerous occasions, including in the 2004 movie, The Alamo (pictured)

Another important relic is Jim Bowie's famous knife with which he is reputed to have fought tirelessly, killing many Mexicans during the onslaught. It was after him that the Bowie knife was named.

For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events.

Celebrated
 in song, story and cinema, the story of heroism against all the odds 
helped define the young nation's pursuit of liberty.

The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

The leaders of the group included Davy Crockett (pictured), already famous as a frontiersman, storyteller and crack shot, and James Bowie, known for his distinctive knife. It has long been part of the Alamo legend that Crockett died fighting.

News of the resistance helped garner support among the rebels, who defeated Santa Anna's army at the Battle of San Jacinto amid cries of 'Remember the Alamo!'

The historic victory cemented the status of the newly formed Republic of Texas.

The legend was firmly established by the 1955 Disney TV show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty rifle as the hordes of Mexican soldiers closed in for the kill.

It has since been the subject of a host of Hollywood movies, including a 1960 John Wayne epic and a 
2004 version with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton.

In 2012, the year after he announced 
his retirement from music because of health problems caused by drumming,
 Collins wrote a 384-page book, The Alamo and Beyond: A Collector's 
Journey.

He added: 'I'm 
just an enthusiastic amateur. What I know is out there to be learned, 
it's just that I took the time to do it, because of the book and to find
 out what I was buying.'

Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that although the building that will house the collection is not yet built, some items will be displayed as soon as October.

The collection is worth millions but Collins said, 'Being British, we don't talk about that kind of thing.'

He told the Guardian: 'I'm not extravagant in other ways, I live a very simple 
life. Pretty simple. I mean, I came down here from New York in a private
 plane so it's not that simple.

'But on the other hand, I don't buy 
extravagant items like cars, expensive houses, jewellery. I've got no 
other expensive interests.

'My interests, for the last 25 years anyway, 
have been relics, buying things that are attached to something that I 
feel very interested about. Even I have a limit … I was offered 
something once for a million dollars.'

He said his love affair with the battle itself centred on the fact that 'people came here and made a stand here – for good or bad'.

'That's another
 political can of worms,' he told the paper.

'But for good or bad they came here knowing 
they were going to die, hoping they weren't but knowing they probably 
would, and that appealed to me even at six or seven, the idea of being 
that brave.'
