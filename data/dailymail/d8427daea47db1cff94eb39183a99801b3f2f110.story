A ban on nudists getting undressed on one of Britain's most famous beaches has been lifted by the Queen's estate.

Officials told naturists they must cover up on the sands at Holkham, north Norfolk, after complaints that it had become 'a haven for swingers and perverts'.

Nudists were warned they faced arrest and prosecution if they got undressed on the beach which attracts around 500,000 visitors every year.

But after a campaign by British Naturism, which has around 10,000 members, the Crown Estate has performed a U-turn.

They insisted 'a small minority of troublemakers' was to blame for anti-social behaviour and were prepared to seek a judicial review if the ban was not lifted immediately.

Campaigns director Malcolm Boura said: 'We very much welcome the lifting of the ban and we are meeting the other interested parties later this month.

'We are confident that by following best practice any remaining problems can be resolved. We hope that it is all behind us now.'

He
 added: 'A lot of naturists were extremely angry and upset when the ban 
was put in place but there is no reason why it should happen again.

'That part of the beach has been used by naturists for as long as anyone can remember and we are working very hard to ensure it stays that way.'

The ban on nudism in the dunes, which are owned and managed by Holkham Estate, and on all land above mean high water, will still be enforced.

The beach and dunes form part of the Holkham National Nature Reserve which is also managed by the Holkham Estate.

The
 ban came after a Facebook campaign was launched in the summer of 2010 
to crackdown on sex pests roaming the sands. Locals have complained 
about people having sex in public and propositioning beach-goers.

One campaigner wrote in August 2010: 'My last three visits to the beach have seen me propositioned twice.

'I've
 witnessed gay sex in the sand dunes and men walking around "playing". 
I've reported this to the wardens and local PCSO but nothing has been 
done.

'The beach used to be a lovely place to go but now it's just a haven for swingers and perverts who won't take no for an answer.'

David Horton-Fawkes, estates director at the Holkham Estate, said: 'We are aware that the Crown Estate has reversed its decision about nudism on the beach following the threat of judicial review by a small group of naturists.

'Until now the ban on nudism had stopped the illegal activity that has plagued the beach.

'We can only hope that this decision does not re-open the door to those who have ruined this part of the Nature Reserve for the vast majority of beach users.'

He added: 'The ban on nudism on Estate land remains in place because we believe it is important to safeguard our staff and visitors.

'Our team will continue to work closely with the Crown Estate, the police and Natural England to uphold the interests of the majority of people who visit the beach.'

The Queen's Household Cavalry take their horses to swim in the sea at Holkham every summer.

A Facebook group was set up three years ago trying to ban naturists from Holkham Beach

Holkham beach, which is part of Holkham National Nature Reserve, attracts about 500,000 visitors a year. 

It was the setting of the final scene in the Oscar-winning film Shakespeare In Love. The film ends with Gwyneth Paltrow walking along the sand. 

Natural England has described it as one of the most important and heavily  visited sites in the UK. 

The beach is backed by a pine forest and is renowned for being one of the best stretches of unspoiled coastline in the UK. 

It regularly makes the list of the most recommended naturist beaches. 

The stretch of sand has also played host to a Royal holiday.

In 1957, the Queen, Prince Philip and a young Princess Anne and Prince Charles spent time on the beach.

The conservation area is also a favourite among twitchers as a variety of birds graze along the salt marshes.

The beach, which features about three miles of unspoiled sand, is largely man-made. 

It was reclaimed from the sea in the 19th Century by the 2nd Earl of Leicester, who planted pine trees to stabilise the sand.
