Since Osama Bin Laden was killed nine months ago, there has
been a clamour for the CIA to release secret images and videos of his death.

Now it appears a reluctant U.S. government might be forced into revealing
some of the 52 graphic photos thanks to a lawsuit from an activist group.

A former top privacy official claims a government response
to a Judicial Watch lawsuit concedes they are legally obliged to disclose
some images.

Former Justice Department Office of Information and Privacy
director Dan Metcalfe told The Atlantic Wire he had looked closely at the
brief.

‘It in effect concedes that there are reasonably segregable,
non-exempt portions of the records that are legally required to be disclosed,’
he said.

The ‘graphic’ images include ‘post-mortem images of UBL's
body’, CIA National Clandestine Service director John Bennett wrote in September.

‘They depict the fatal bullet wound to UBL’s (Bin Laden's)
head and other similarly gruesome images of his corpse,’ he added, reported ABC
News.

Compound: The lawsuit was brought by Judicial Watch after the former Al Qaeda leader was taken out by Navy SEALs in Abbottabad, Pakistan, last May

A Freedom of Information request was brought by Judicial Watch three days after
the Al Qaeda leader was taken out by Navy SEALs in Pakistan.

But the CIA is worried that if any photos are released they
could be inflammatory by inspiring terror attacks on U.S. targets by other
extremists.

Bin Laden was buried at sea following Muslim traditions to
avoid creating a shrine to his extremist followers, reported the Huffington
Post.

Mr Metcalfe has previously defended more than 500 Freedom of
Information and Privacy Act lawsuits for the U.S. government.

Dispute: Privacy expert Dan Metcalfe, left, said Barack Obama, right, went too far in trying to keep all of the death images secret 'in lump fashion'

But he told the Atlantic Wire that the Obama administration
went too far in trying to keep all of the death images secret ‘in lump fashion’.

Should Bin Laden's death photos be released?

Instead the ‘grossly overbroad’ government should have dealt
with each image individually and split them up into two piles, Mr Metcalfe added.

This could mean some images featuring high-tech military equipment
or the faces of Navy SEALs may be redacted, while others may be released.

Judicial Watch has been given until February 8 to reply to the
Justice Department's response brief filed on Wednesday. The case continues.

Meanwhile, the top U.S. intelligence official told Congress
on Tuesday that Al Qaeda is in decline globally but is still a leading threat
to America.

Al Qaeda and Iran are part of a mosaic of interconnected
enemies the U.S. faces, Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper said.

The terrorist group still aspires to strike the U.S., but it
will likely have to go for ‘smaller, simpler attacks’ as its ranks are thinned,
he said.

Four of its top 20 men were captured or killed in a week last
year, leaving a leadership struggling to replace itself, CIA chief David
Petraeus added.
