A mother visiting Costa with her six-year-old daughter found a large shard of glass in her takeaway coffee.

Charlene Sweeney, 26, was horrified when she discovered the sharp fragment at the bottom of her latte as she went to finish the drink.

She returned to the shop in Poole, Dorset, the following day crying as she told the manager what had happened - and has vowed never to use the chain again.

Shocked: Charlene Sweeney was horrified to discover a shard of glass at the bottom of the latte she had bought from Costa and has vowed not to use the coffee chain in the future

She said: 'I was really shocked. The chunk of glass was at the bottom and was so heavy that it wouldn't have floated to the top.

'I went back to Costa the next day and cried as I told the manager what had happened.

'I used to be a regular customer in there, going nearly every day, and now I will never go in there again.

'I understand that they are really busy in Costa but they have a duty of care to their customers.'

After discovering the shard of glass, Ms Sweeney immediately checked her daughter Tiya's babyccino - a drink for children made from frothy milk - but to her relief did not find any glass inside it.

She has since handed the shard to environmental health officers so that they can investigate - and says she will avoid Costa from now on.

Dangerous: The huge chunk of glass has been handed to environmental health officers to investigate

A spokesman for Costa, Britain's largest coffee chain, said the incident was a one-off and that they had given Charlene a £100 voucher to apologise.

He said: 'Our area manager has spoken to Ms Sweeney and apologised for the distress this obviously caused her.

'This was an isolated incident and does not reflect our high standards of safety and hygiene.'

Jeff Morley, an environmental health officer from Poole council, said an investigation had been carried out and no action would be taken against Costa.

He said: 'An officer visited Costa Coffee following the complaint.

'The piece of glass did not match any glass in the premises and the manager was not aware of any breakages.

'The staff are following the company procedure in respect of any breakages and we are not taking any further action.'
