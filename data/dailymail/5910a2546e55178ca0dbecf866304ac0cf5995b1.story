Thousands more pensioners may have to sell their family homes to afford inflation-busting increases in residential care fees.

Research has found average care home fees have soared by as much as 14 per cent over the past year, forcing families to find hundreds of pounds more every month.

Fees are rising because councils, which fund poorer residents, are slashing back the amount they are prepared to pay for them.

This means private care home operators are making up the difference by increasing prices for everyone else.

In London, where the rises have been highest, annual average charges are now £35,300, up £4,400 from a year ago.

For those who have to go into a nursing home offering more care and attention, costs are even greater. In counties to the north of London, average charges are £45,100 a year.

Across the UK the average residential care home fee is £27,300 – up 5 per cent on a year ago – while nursing home charges have risen 4 per cent to £37,500.

The research, by Age UK, revealed a postcode lottery, with pensioners paying far more for residential care in some areas than others.

While average fees were highest in the capital at £679 a week, in East Anglia they have soared by 12 per cent to £554 a week (£28,800 a year) and in the North East and Cumbria by 11 per cent to £487 a week (£25,300 a year).

Sad state of affairs: More than 20,000 pensioners have to sell their homes every year to pay for the massive costs of residential care, often denying their children inheritance in the process (picture posed by model)

The increases are being fuelled by town hall cuts that see extra costs piled on those who pay for their care because they have savings of more than £23,500, while those who have not been thrifty get it free.

At least 20,000 pensioners are forced to sell their homes every year to pay the huge costs of residential care, denying their children an inheritance. The increased charges will mean many more will have to sell up.

Age UK’s figures, compiled using data from healthcare analysts Laing & Buisson, represent average increases including both the fees paid by councils for state-funded residents as well as those paid by private payers.

Self-funders pay around £100 more for their places than councils, meaning the fee increases hide the reality that costs for private residents are rising even more steeply.

The figures come just months before ministers set out a long-awaited white paper on reform of social care.

Economist Andrew Dilnot suggested in an independent report last summer that there should be a cap of around £35,000 to prevent unlimited charges.

But there are indications that insurance schemes to enable this would not be in place for another 15 years.

Last night Michelle Mitchell of Age UK said: ‘The under-funding crisis in care is hitting older people hard and self-funding care home residents are unjustly having to foot the bill for cuts to social care.

‘Care home residents aren’t in a position to move and shop around for more affordable deals.  And for those who self-fund, the low interest earned from savings accounts won’t cover these price increases.

‘Older people in residential care need a fair deal when they are paying for their care.

‘To tackle the immediate crisis, the Government has to recognise and close the gap in social care spending.’

Liz Kendall, Labour’s spokesman for care and older people, said: ‘Thousands of self-funders are ordinary people on middle incomes.

‘They have worked hard and saved all their lives and are now being forced to sell their homes to pay for their care, through no fault of their own.

‘The Government is out of touch on this issue, and in denial about the real impact their cuts are having.

‘We urgently need a better, fairer way to fund care for older people. Cross-party talks on this issue, which Labour called for, are now under way.’

Last night Peter Hay of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services said: ‘There is no evidence that care providers, forced to make penny-pinching savings on their local authority contracts, are compensating for the losses by over-charging individual self-funding residents and their families.’
