Fall: Jared Maillet, 21, plunged to his death while climbing Snowdon, north Wales

A student racing to break a mountain climbing record plunged to his death on one of Britain’s highest peaks.

Jared Maillet, 21, was leading friends in a race to climb every peak above 3,000ft in the Snowdonia mountain range when he fell.

An
inquest heard the American exchange student pushed ahead on his own to 
try to break his university’s record - but fell 300ft off an icy ridge.

A
keen mountaineer, Mr Maillet was taking part in the Welsh 3000s, an 
attempt to climb all of the peaks above 3,000 feet in Snowdonia within 
24 hours.

Mr Maillet, 
from Maine, was studying sustainability and urban planning at the 
University of Manchester when he entered the mountain race.

Climbing partner Magdalena Borkowska told the inquest she and Mr Maillet began the race at 4.20am but he soon left her trailing.

She
said: 'He was keen to break the club record for the event. He wasn’t 
hanging around. He had stated he was going to win the event.

'I could see his head torch bobbing up and down. I saw him as I approached the summit of Snowdon.

'He was already heading for the second peak.'

University
of Manchester Hiking Club official Colin Shaw said a group of 25 
students were on the weekend trip to Snowdonia - with 12 taking part in 
the race.

He said 
students had been advised to do the event in pairs or small groups and 
was 'concerned' Mr Maillet planned to do it alone.

Mr Shaw said Jared was an 'experienced climber' and 'seemed really enthusiastic, full of confidence, really bouncing around'.

Adventurer: The student, 21, from Arizona State University was an exchange student at Manchester University

Peter Robertson, of Llanberis 
Mountain Rescue team, said the weather conditions were good but when the
group started out there had been patchy low cloud on the summit.

Mr
Robertson said: 'He was making his way onto Crib Goch and it is very 
easy to be led on to the ridge of Clogwyn y Person which becomes 
progressively steeper.

'Unfortunately he slipped and fell 300ft - it is an unforgiving place.

'His body was found in snow at the foot of Clogwyn y Person later that morning. He had suffered multiple injuries.

'It’s very probable he tried to descend below the cloud to gain a visual reference.'

Accident spot: Parson's Nose on Mount Snowdon which is near where the accident happened. The student fell from a ridge which was covered in ice

Explorer: Jared Maillet, 21, from Maine, US, was trying to complete the Welsh 3000 challenge where people have to reach the top of all 15 mountains over 3000ft in Wales within the space of 24 hours

Caernarfon Coroners Court heard the 
Arizona State University student was airlifted from the peak by a Sea 
King search and rescue helicopter but it was too late to save him.

North Wales coroner Nicola Jones said his death in April was accidental.

She said: 'It appears he was extremely enthusiastic, physically fit and sufficiently experienced to take part in the challenge.

'It is likely he made a navigational error that took him onto Clogwyn y Person rather than Crib Goch.

'It may be he tried to descend below cloud to get a visual reference but he slipped and fell.'

Tragedy: The student fell to his death while climbing Snowdon in North Wales

North Wales coroner Nicola Jones said Jared Maillet was likely to have made a 'navigational error' taking him on to Clogwyn y Person rather than Crib Goch

No one from Jared’s family was at the inquest, but his sister Christie, 23, spoke movingly soon after his death.

She said: 'I don’t like thinking about how he died, so I am thinking of it this way - he took the lead because he is a leader.

'I’d like to think he passed out immediately and felt no pain or fear.

'The only comforting thing is that he was not cold and alone. He was loved by so many people, and no one will forget him.

'I hope we all can live like he did. He was such a goddamn good and happy person.'

Peak: The tragedy happened on Mount Snowdon, the tallest mountain in Wales on a ridge at 2,500ft near a precarious route known as Parson's Nose
