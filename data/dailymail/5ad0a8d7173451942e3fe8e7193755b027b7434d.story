Thirteen years ago, photographer Miyoko Ihara began snapping pictures of the budding relationship between her now 88-year-old grandmother, Misa, and her tiny kitten, Fukumaru.

The odd-eyed white cat is always in Misa's shadow whether she is farming the land, cooking, relaxing or even having a bath.

Now their images have been published in a photo book, the pair have stormed to popularity in Japan with the unlikely bestseller flying off the shelves and becoming a viral sensation in the United States.

Dedicated friends: Spanning over 12 years, the woman's granddaughter, Miyoko Ihara, photographed their enduring relationship

Inseparable: Ever since the day Misa found Fukumaru, which breaks up to mean 'good fortune' and 'circle' in Japanese, in the shed, they have firm friends

Keepsake: Their beautiful friendship is documented in a photo book: Misao the Big Mama and Fukumaru the Cat

Fukumaru was born to a stray cat in a shed on Misa's land in 2003.

But Misa took the young kitten under her wing and he has grown to become her inseparable companion.

The author says that she names the kitten 'Fukumaru  in hope that 'God of fuku (good fortune) comes and everything will be smoothed over like maru (circle).'

Now over a decade later the pair have shared many experiences as well as birthdays.

Happy to watch:  Fukumaru watches Misa go about her work cleaning the vegetables

Growing old together: The pair have barely ever been apart and their friendship has blossomed over the years

The author writes: 'The grandmother whose hearing become weak and Fukumaru who has hearing disabilities are always looking into each other's eyes and feeling warmth each other'

Loving friends: The companions share a kiss in a quick snapshot

Every day Misao goes out to her land in Chiba to farm and Fukumaru follows her.

The cat usually curls up in the warmth of the sun watching her owner work as well as wandering over to see what she is is doing.

Fukumaru accompanies Misao when she takes a bath and eats dinner as well as lazing across her companion when they are relaxing.

'Partly because they are both hard of 
hearing, my grandmother and Fukumaru are always looking into each 
other’s eyes. They’re really close,” Miyoko Ihara told Nippon.com.

Sharing time: Fukumaru watched as Misao takes a bath of fruit

Happy: Miyoko says: 'Fukumaru is so happy and contented at my grandmother's side. When I take a picture of the two of them together it's like I'm photographing myself as a little girl'

'Fukumaru is so happy and contented at my grandmother’s side. When I 
take a picture of the two of them together it’s like I’m photographing 
myself as a little girl.' she explained.

'When I see the way my grandmother is 
living her life, I really feel that she has a kind of strength that my 
generation simply can’t match. She gets up with the sun, and goes to bed
 when it sets.

'She loves her cat and the vegetables in her field like 
her own children. If her vegetables come out well, she’s happy. She 
doesn’t have to worry about questions like ’what is the point of my 
work?’ Her way of life fills me with admiration and a sort of envy,' 
Miyoko Ihara said.

Their adventures are documented in Misao the Big Mama and Fukumaru the Cat.

Comfortable companions: Since Misa found the cat abandoned in a shed, the pair have barely ever been apart

History: Fukumaru is an 'odd-eyed' cat, with one yellow eye and one blue, born to a stray cat in a barn on the Ihara family¿s land

Fun in the sun: Fukumaru curls up in a basket contentedly as his owner juggles oranges

Perfect pairing: The pair are happy companions and Misao is always in his owner's shadow
