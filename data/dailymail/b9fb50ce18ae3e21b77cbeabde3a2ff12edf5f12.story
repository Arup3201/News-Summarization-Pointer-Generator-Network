Kei Nishikori blew men’s tennis off its axis on Saturday night when he caused a sensational upset to overcome Novak Djokovic and reach the US Open final.

The 24-year-old, from Japan, braved fierce heat and humidity to beat the world No 1 6-4, 1-6, 7-6, 6-3 in two hours 52 minutes and become the first male from his country to reach a Grand Slam in the modern era.

He was left awaiting the winner of the second semi-final between Roger Federer and No 14 seed Marin Cilic, for whom the stakes were substantially raised.

Relief: After his previous two matches lasted a total eight and a half hours, four sets was quick work

Nishikori, who has had 14 retirements in his career and been frequently been held back by injuries or a lack of stamina, handled the brutal conditions better than the Wimbledon champion, who for once was outlasted.

It was a brilliant display from the No 10 seed, whose nerve occasionally failed him but who held out to pull off a seismic result against the strong favourite for the title, who defeated Andy Murray in the previous round. 

‘It’s an amazing feeling, I’m so happy,’ said an ecstatic Nishikori afterwards. ‘I hope I can recover for the final. He started to play better in the second set. I hope it’s big news in Japan. I feel the support from there. It’s four in the morning there but I hope they’ve been watching.’

Trained at the Nick Bollettieri IMG academy in Florida from the age of 11, Nishikori’s experience of the fierce American summer heat came into its own as he refused to flag against Djokovic, who suffered in the furnace that the Arthur Ashe Stadium became.

His coach Michael Chang seemed more animated than he ever was as a player as he watched from the bench, urging on his young charge, who lost in the first round of this event last year to British outsider Dan Evans.

Nishikori showed his potential earlier this year when he should have beaten Rafael Nadal on clay in Madrid before seizing up with cramp, but this did not happen when in sight of the biggest win of his career.

His backhand was especially punishing as he took the first set, only for normal service seemingly to be resumed when Djokovic bounced back in the second by making him run all over the place.

The Japanese failed to serve out the third set at 5-4 and it seemed his chance might have been blown, especially as he conceded the break back with a double fault.

Yet in the tie-break, in which both players were extremely nervous and double faulted once each, it was his mental strength that just about held out and he took it 7-4 — crucial, given the expectation that he might fade towards the end of the match.

That did not happen and it was Djokovic who became more erratic in the heat of the afternoon, going down an early break in the fourth and never threatening to get it back against an opponent who, while not physically imposing, is a terrific mover around the court.

Nishikori got safely to 5-3 in the fourth and then broke once more for good measure when Djokovic drove a final forehand long.
