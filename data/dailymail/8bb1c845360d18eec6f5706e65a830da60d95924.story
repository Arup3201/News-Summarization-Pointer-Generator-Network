While the rest of the nation took a breather after the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, there was no let-up for Her Majesty yesterday.

After four gruelling days of engagements, the 86-year-old Queen conducted private audiences at Buckingham Palace before meeting prime ministers and governors-general from across the Commonwealth at a reception to honour her 60 years on the throne.

She then visited the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital, where he is receiving treatment for a bladder infection.

Buoyed up: She leaves hospital relieved to have found Philip on good form

Time well spent: The Queen spent approximately 50 minutes with her husband

The couple, who have been married for 
64 years, spent more than three quarters of an hour chatting about the 
hugely successful jubilee celebrations, which Philip apparently watched 
on television from his sick bed.

As she left, the Queen beamed with delight, seemingly hugely relieved at what she had seen.

A palace spokesman confirmed the 
duke’s condition had ‘improved considerably’ since being admitted to the
Edward VII Hospital in London hours before the Diamond Jubilee concert 
on Monday and that he was in ‘good spirits’.

He was also visited for an 
hour yesterday by his son, the Duke of York, who confirmed that he was 
‘mending very well – but bored’.

However the spokesman warned that 
Philip was likely to remain there for a few more days yet while doctors 
treated his infection with antibiotics. It means that he could spend his
91st birthday on Sunday confined to his hospital bed.

But a source told The Sun of his determination to be home before then. 'Princwe Philip is as tough as old boots and the last thing he wants is to be stuck in hospital on his birthday weekend,' the source said.

'He has made it very clear to doctors he wants to be well enough to go home by Sunday'

For the Queen, the first job of the 
day was to unveil an official Diamond Jubilee portrait of herself, 
commissioned by the Canadian government, in the White Drawing Room at 
Buckingham Palace.

She then held audiences with the Prime Ministers of Canada and New Zealand, both of whom are on official visits to the UK.

Afterwards it was off to meet with her Commonwealth Heads of Government.

Before she arrived at 12.45pm, she was
confronted by a group of Tamil and human rights protesters gathered 
outside historic Marlborough House in London, who opposed the inclusion 
of the Sri Lankan President.

Ever diplomatic, however, the Queen, 
dressed in a floral print silk dress in shades of blue and grey by 
Stuart Parvin and a blue wool crepe hat, shook hands with Mahinda 
Rajapaksa at a reception in the Blenheim Saloon.

She was joined by David and Samantha 
Cameron along with more than 70 heads of state to pay tribute to her six
decades on the throne.

Despite her hectic schedule, the Queen
seemed remarkably relaxed as she was handed a posy by nine-year-old 
Aduke Bandele, the daughter of a member of the Commonwealth Secretariat 
staff, before the dignitaries took their places for lunch.

Commonwealth Secretary-General 
Kamalesh Sharma also formally greeted them all, saying: ‘It gives me 
great pleasure to welcome you all on this very special day in the 
history of the Commonwealth.’

The group then enjoyed a brie and avocado 
terrine followed by wild sea bass and for dessert an apple crumble 
souffle, apple pie ice cream and caramelised apple, with South African 
wines.

The Queen, who was seated on the 
Golden Wattle table – each was named after a Commonwealth flower – 
chatted easily with her fellow heads of state over almost two hours.

She looked particularly delighted when
soprano Laura Wright entertained them with a performance of the 
organisation’s official song, Stronger As One, before being presented 
with a bronze plaque.

Following lunch, the party retired to 
the garden to chat and pose for a historic ‘family photograph’ together 
before the Queen left at around 3pm.

Her unfailing energy and enthusiasm
left many of those she met asking the same question: How on earth does 
she do it?

Thankfully, her next engagement is 
not until Tuesday, when she is due to hold a garden party at 
Sandringham, her Norfolk residence.

She and Philip were due to spend the 
weekend together there privately and it is not yet clear whether she 
still plans to travel to East Anglia, in the hope that her husband will 
be able to join her.

As of last night she was still staying at 
Buckingham Palace.

After Tuesday’s garden party her diary
will continue in earnest with a visit to Nottingham with the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge on Wednesday and Hertfordshire on Thursday.

Beaming:
The Queen, who admitted in a public address made on Monday evening that she was 'humbled' by the enthusiasm with which 
the nation marked her Jubilee, looked delighted to be continuing the 
celebrations

Aides 
are still waiting to discover if Philip will join her.

She will be back at Buckingham Palace 
on Friday for another Jubilee-related engagement with the Duchess of 
Cornwall followed by Trooping the Colour the next day.

The following week there is the Order 
of the Garter Service at Windsor and Royal Ascot – giving the Queen 
little respite from her royal duties.

As
his mother hosted a lunch for 70 at Marlborough House in central London
today, Prince Charles attended his own engagement - but his was a touch
less formal.

Prince 
Charles left London early this morning to make a trip to the Ayrshire 
where he paid a visit to Scotsheep 2012, an agricultural show held at 
Dumfries House.

Wearing a 
cream jacket - a departure from the green Barbour jacket he usually 
favours - he moved between the stands, chatting to local farmers and 
posing for photographs.

The
prince is a patron of Campaign For Wool, an organisation set up in 
support of the wool trade, which was exhibition at the event.
