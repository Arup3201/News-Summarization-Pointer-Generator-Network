A friend of Ched Evans has claimed how the disgraced footballer shot him with an air rifle, before offering him more than £10,000 to keep it quiet.

Andrew Barnes, 25, was allegedly shot in the thigh by former Welsh striker Evans, also 25, who had been hiding behind a garage shed at Mr Barnes’s parents' home in Stretford, Greater Manchester.

After he had been shot with the gas-fired air rifle, the business consultant was taken to hospital with a pellet lodged in his bones - but doctors left it there over fears that removing it would be unsafe.

Mr Barnes told The Sun’s Lauren Veevers: ‘I could see a hole in my thigh where the pellet had gone. Doctors said it was only my bone that stopped it going all the way through my leg and out again.

‘How can someone in their right mind fire an air rifle at a friend? He was quite far away when he fired. Had he moved the gun by millimetres, it could have hit my chest and killed me.’

Evans was said to have been concerned about his employers Manchester City finding out what had happened - but Mr Barnes’s mother told chiefs at the club, which allegedly landed Evans in trouble.

The footballer and his friend Clayton McDonald - who was cleared in the rape trial over the incident at a hotel in North Wales in May 2011 - had reportedly been lodging at Mr Barnes’s parents' house.

Mr Barnes claimed that before the shooting incident in 2009, he had seen Evans peering round the garage at the home and pointing the gun at him from about 50ft (15 metres) away.

He added: ‘Then I felt something in my leg and realised he shot me. Ched was always shooting things in the garden.’

Mr Barnes said his mother found pellets in cupboard doors, walls, sinks, window frames and even the fridge. He said that shortly after the incident happened he launched legal action against Evans.

Police allegedly questioned Evans and McDonald but no charges were brought. Just before Evans’s rape trial, he offered Mr Barnes a £10,900 payout with a gagging agreement.

The footballer was convicted of rape in April 2012, and the next month a £10,000 payout was agreed - for injuries and legal costs.

Last night, Evans broke his public silence to insist he had committed an ‘act of infidelity’ not rape. He told his long-suffering girlfriend Natasha Massey that he was sorry for cheating on her with the drunken 19-year-old.

It was Evans’s first public statement since being freed last Friday halfway through his five-year jail sentence for rape. 

It came in a video posted on a website set up to try to clear his name. But Evans did not apologise for what happened to the woman in a hotel room, claiming it was ‘consensual and not rape’.

Striker: Sheffield United has denied offering Evans a new contract but refused to rule out signing him again

The woman, now 22, has been forced to move away from friends and family in North Wales and take on a new identity after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her.

Miss Massey’s millionaire father Karl is bankrolling the fight to quash his conviction, including taking on a new legal team which has submitted evidence to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

It is fast-tracking a decision on whether to back a second appeal after senior judges rejected the first in 2012. Sheffield United has denied offering Evans a new contract but refused to rule out signing him again.

A petition set up by a feminist blogger using the pseudonym Jean Hatchet urging the club not to reinstate Evans has 150,000 signatures.

And BBC veteran Michael Buerk was attacked by campaigners yesterday for saying Evans’s victim did not come out ‘with any credit as she had ‘drunk so much she could barely stand’.

The website set up to try to clear Evans’s name says he will not be speaking to the media, and that numerous requests for exclusive interviews with him have all been declined.
