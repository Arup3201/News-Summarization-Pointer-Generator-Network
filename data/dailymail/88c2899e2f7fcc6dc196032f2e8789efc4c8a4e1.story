A pair of brothers have been arrested 25 years after a teenager was found beaten to death in a forest.

Shannon Siders from Newaygo, Michigan, disappeared in July 1989 aged 18.

She was allegedly last seen riding in a car belonging to the pair - today Newaygo County prosecutor confirmed Matthew Jones, 44, of Grant and his brother, Paul Jones, 42, are now facing first degree murder charges.

Shannon's body was found three months after her disappearance in the Manistee National Forest, an area that was frequented by partying teenagers. 

Investigators determined she was murdered, but for decades no arrests were made, until now.

In 2011, a cold case team was assembled to take another look at Shannon’s murder after a documentary about her disappearance was aired.

Today Shannon's father Bob said: 'It is a good day'

They made the big decision to exhume her body in the search for more clues, a risk we can only assume led to the arrests.

Today Shannon's father told Fox 17: 'Back then there was a short list of five names.

'They were the first two on it. And it is a good day; it is not the end -- it is the beginning of the end.

'There are still questions that I may not get answers to.'

'It’s the beginning of the end. For true justice to be served I believe in capital punishment,' Mr Siders said.

The brothers were 17 and 19-years-old at the time of Shannon’s murder.

'This case remained open for many years but Shannon Siders was never forgotten and law enforcement's resolve to hold those accountable for her death never diminished,' said Newaygo County Prosecutor Robert Springstead reported WZZM13.

'This case is a perfect example of what can be accomplished when multiple agencies cooperate, collaborate and share resources.'

In 2012, the cold case team exhumed Shannon's body in the search for more clues
