A devoted couple who died just two hours apart have been cremated together in a double casket in what is thought to be the first funeral of its kind in Britain.

Kevin and Christine Shearson, both 64, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, passed away just a week before they planned to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary.

Mr Shearson had been left with a string of health problems after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and he had made frequent visits to hospital since the beginning of the year.

Together forever: Kevin and Christine Shearson, both 64, were cremated in this double casket after dying within two hours of each other - just a week before their 40th wedding anniversary

Mr Shearson had been left with a string of health problems after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and his wife was struck down with a chest infection after becoming anxious about her husband's health

Last month his condition worsened and he was admitted to the intensive care unit of Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire.

His
 wife kept a vigil at his bedside but came down with a chest infection 
after becoming stressed and anxious about her husband’s health.

She
 was given a bed directly next to her husband’s but tragically died on 
May 18 after telling her family that ‘deep down’ she knew her husband 
wouldn’t survive.

Around 150 people attended the funeral at West Hertfordshire Crematorium in Watford on Wednesday

Two hours later her husband, a retired driving instructor, passed away from pneumonia.

Yesterday, the couple were finally laid to rest alongside each other in the same casket - so they remain together beyond the grave.

Daughter Kelly, 38, attended the service at West Hertfordshire Crematorium in Watford and said it was the ‘perfect send-off’.

She said: ‘It all went really well. The casket was taken to the crematorium in a horse-drawn carriage.

The couple first met in 1971 when they worked at the same stapling factory. They had been planning to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary on May 25 but died a week before in neigbouring hospital beds

‘It was definitely nice to know they were together right until the end. That gave us a sense of comfort.

‘There was about 150 people there but I wasn’t surprised. They were well loved people.

‘It was a nice sense of closure knowing that they have been laid to rest.’

They had been planning to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary on May 25.

But instead their grieving family travelled to a beauty spot near to their home and released 40 ruby balloons in their memory.

Tim Morris, from the Institution of Cemetery and Crematorium Management, said he has never heard of a married couple being laid to rest in the same casket.

He said it is something normally only reserved for mothers and their babies or a set of twins.

He said: ‘Personally I haven’t heard of this happening before but this is what the family wants and there is nothing in the law to say they can’t do it.

‘It gives them some comfort and I would like to say congratulations to the crematorium for giving them the service they wanted.’
