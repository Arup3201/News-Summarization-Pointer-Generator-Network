A protester has been banned from all Qantas and Jetstar flights after staging a protest to stop the deportation of a Tamil asylum seeker on her flight.

Jasmine Pilbrow received an email from Qantas condemning the political statement and saying her 'actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group'.

Ms Pilbrow boarded the plane objecting to the transfer and deportation of Puvaneethan, a 25-year-old refugee, who she believed would face persecution upon arriving back in Sri Lanka.

Three people have been banned from flying with Qantas after a making a political statement against the deportation of a Tamil asylum seeker

'If he is sent back to Sri Lanka, he is likely to be imprisoned and tortured,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Upon boarding the flight Ms Pilbrow refused to take her seat until Puvaneethan was taken off the plane and returned to the Melbourne Immigration Detention Centre.

Ms Pilbrow says she learnt of her ban after reading an article published by Fairfax Media last Tuesday.

'I tried to follow up on the ban but there was no number for me to call. When I called Qantas headquarters they sent me to customer service who told me to fill out a form if I had a complaint about the ban,' Ms Pilbrow said, adding that she is seeking legal advice.

'Communication at Qantas needs to be fixed up.'

Ms Pilbrow is not alone as two other passengers also received ban notices after deciding they would boycott the flight.

Paul Leary, 51, and his female colleague were not involved in the protest but said they felt 'uncomfortable' upon learning of Puvaneethan's deportation.

Mr Leary said he and a colleague felt faced with a 'moral dilemma.' After his female colleague decided she was not comfortable being on the plane Mr Leary also decided not to fly.

'We couldn't have been politer. We were travelling for business, we've both got executive roles in the organisation we work for… we were not aggravating or inciting other people,' Mr Leary told Daily Mail Australia.

When he and his colleague were back inside the airport the federal police took their details but no one from Qantas informed them at that point of any kind of ban.

It wasn't until Mr Leary was returning from Darwin four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to Melbourne with Qantas and was told he was subject to a no-fly ban.

'As a result of your actions on board QF838 from MELDRW on 2nd February, we have decided to issue you a No Fly Notification - Until Further Notice while the incident is investigated,' Qantas wrote.

'I still didn't hear anything by Monday and the only response I got was to submit a customer care complaint,' he added.

After Mr Leary submitted his complaint he then received a formal letter on February 16 informing him of his ban.

Paul Leary was issued with this 'no fly notification' after he walked off a flight from Melbourne to Darwin which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation 

While Ms Pilbrow was dissatisfied by the way Qantas communicated the ban to her, she said it was not right for the other two passengers, who were not part of the protest, to also face a ban

Mr Leary has since complained to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal's human rights division saying the ban discriminates against him on the basis of his political belief.

'If alternatively there was no asylum seeker on the plane and I decided to accompany my colleague off the plane because she was ill I don't think I'd be banned.

'So the only reason I can see for this ban is my political beliefs… I'm not a known activist, I never have been. I'm in my fifties, I'm not a radical.'

His female colleague is also  filing a complaint.

A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the passengers will remain on a no fly list until the incident has been investigated by the Australian Federal Police. 

'As the incident is under investigation, it is not appropriate to comment further.' 

Ms Pilbrow says it is unfair that the other two passengers, who were not part of the protest, also received bans
