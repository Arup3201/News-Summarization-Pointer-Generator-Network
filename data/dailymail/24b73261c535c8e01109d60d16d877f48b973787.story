A moose decided it wanted to join the party when it took a dip in a private swimming pool at a holiday villa. 

The group of holidaymakers were shocked when they spotted the beast swimming a few lengths of the pool in Redmond, Washington, before relaxing in the shallow end. 

The creature looked like it was having a whale of a time as the party panicked about how it was going to get out of the pool and more importantly, if they would have the poolside to themselves again.

But they need not have worried. The enormous animal managed to gracefully clamber out, carefully stepping over the poolside deckchairs as it made an effort not to crush anything.

The video has now been viewed almost a million times on YouTube. 

As the 7ft high moose tries to clamber out of the pool, the stunned filmmakers can be heard saying worryingly: 'Do we have moose insurance?'

When faced with the closed wooden poolside gate, the moose appears to stop and ponder for a moment - before elegantly stepping right over it, gingerly stepping down the stairs, then heading back off into the forest.
