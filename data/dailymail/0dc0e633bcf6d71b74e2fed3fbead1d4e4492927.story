Headteacher Anne Lakey leaves Durham Crown Court today after the jury in her sexual offences case failed to reach a verdict

A jury has failed to reach verdicts in the trial of an acclaimed headteacher who was accused of having sex with a 13-year-old in the late 1980s.

Anne Lakey, 54, from Stanley, County Durham, denied four counts of indecent assault and two of indecency with a child which were said to have happened when she was in her late 20s.

The jury, which deliberated at Durham Crown Court for 10 hours, was discharged by Judge Christopher Prince after failing to agree verdicts.

Prosecutor Caroline Goodwin indicated that the Crown would be seeking a retrial.

The complainant, who was not one of Mrs Lakey's pupils, wrote an accusing email to her school in December 2012 after he came across a web page on which she said her aim was to give young people the best start in life.

That led him to write that she was a 'disgusting sexual monster' who had sex with him when he was only 13. The school called in the police and she was suspended from her role.

He claimed they played a dare game at her home and she allowed him to fondle her breasts. Later, he chatted to her as she bathed, he told the jury, and after one such occasion he said they had sex while he was still in his school uniform.

The alleged victim said their relationship continued for several months, and claimed she rang his school, pretending to be his mother, when he played truant to be with her.

The prosecution alleged Mrs Lakey, who was then a history teacher at a school in Sunderland, groomed the boy, who was one of a group of teenagers who would visit her marital home.

Mrs Lakey, who has been married to her husband David for 20 years, strongly denied all the allegations against her and thought the accusing email was a hoax when she heard about it.

The mother-of-one told the jury: 'When I was first made aware, it was just utter disbelief. It was not true, therefore (I was) shocked and horrified.'

She could only speculate that the complainant’s motive was to gain compensation.

Mrs Lakey, who was described to the jury as a 'visionary' school leader, denied the allegations

A character witness said Mrs Lakey had been described as a 'visionary leader' by the Department for Education after she oversaw massive improvement at one school.

Paul McHugh, a national educational leadership consultant, said he met Mrs Lakey in 2006, when she had recently taken over Fyndoune Community College in Sacriston, near Durham.

He said: 'The school went from failing for three years to being one of the most improved in the country.

'I put that down to the drive of Mrs Lakey and the senior team. She was described in a DfE (Department for Education) pamphlet as a visionary leader and that is certainly the way I see it.'

Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of education, said she was 'inspiring' and she was appointed on the National Leaders of Education body which helps struggling schools.

After the judge discharged the jury, Miss Goodwin told the court: 'It is likely there will be a retrial. I’m not going to make that decision today.'

Mrs Lakey was told the case will be back before the court next Friday, when the CPS decision will be announced. She said 'thank you' to the judge as she left court.
