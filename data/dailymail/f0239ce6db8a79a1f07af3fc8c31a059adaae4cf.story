It has been branded as ingenious by some and is expected to be snapped up by technology fans when it is released next month. 

But skeptical social media users have taken the opportunity to mock the launch of Apple's new Watch with a selection of memes.

Following the announcement of the device's details by the company today, a collection of photos depicting homemade Apple Watches slowly started to appear.

They included: people attaching iPhones to their wrists with elastic bands; using watchstraps and an iPod Nano to create a lookalike; and some simply stuck a piece of fruit to their hand.

One, however, simply stuck a number of appliances - including a calculator, a phone, scisssors and a GameBoy - to their wrist to display the gadget's versatility.  

Since its unveiling in September the Watch has been shrouded in mystery, with Apple's boss Tim Cook teasing features at every available opportunity. However the features were fully released during a launch event in San Francisco on Monday. 

The CEO added that with typical use the battery life is likely to be 18 hours. What 'typical' use entails remains unknown.

Mr Cook said at the event at Yerba Buena Centre in California: 'This is the most personal device we have ever created. It's not just with you, it's on you.'

Apple initially announced its Watch in September at its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch event in California.

It comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all models are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions.
