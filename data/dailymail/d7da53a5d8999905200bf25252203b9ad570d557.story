After such success in the holding role last season, Steven Gerrard was moved to the top of the midfield diamond. He is a superb player but he could not get into the game.

It is a position that requires constant thrust and bursts of pace but Gerrard is 34 years old now, so that is not his strength.

I can see him playing at the highest level for a couple more years in a deep role but not there. But Brendan Rodgers obviously felt he needed his best player in a more advanced position.

Steven Gerrard has plenty left in him for Liverpool, but not in that attacking midfield position

Gerrard is better suited in a deep role in the midfield for Liverpool; bursting through isn't his strength

Liverpool were relying on Jordan Henderson to break from deep and get beyond Rickie Lambert and Gerrard, as he did for his goal.

Simon Mignolet was at fault for the goal that saw the Bulgarian hosts take the lead on Wednesday night

Messy Mignolet must be better prepared 

People were quick to defend Simon Mignolet for the opening goal, saying the ball bounced awkwardly in front of him, but he was at fault.

Keepers warm up for such a long time these days so there must be something wrong with his preparation. It shouldn’t have been a surprise to him that the surface was uneven. He will know it was an awful mistake.

He seems to have a big problem with long-range efforts - with another one hitting him in the face. Mignolet is having a tough time and he needs to do better.

Did Rodgers drop Dejan Lovren or others or were they just rested? We will find out on Saturday against Stoke.

Rodgers has struggled with managing his squad now Liverpool have games every few days. Is this another attempt to do that or is he is just fed up with too many poor performances?

Raheem Sterling is Liverpool’s brightestshining light. There are not many young English players who can cross with both feet. He drifts past people effortlessly. 

His assist took intelligence: where to run to find space to cross, when to cross and where to cross. And all this happens at pace. His heat map shows how hard he tried to influence the game.
