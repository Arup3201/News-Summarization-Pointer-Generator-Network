A woman is claiming she was raped by the son of one of Canada's most successful businessman. 

Elizabeth Kelly, 50, of Toronto, stated in papers filed on Friday that Steven Joyce sexually assaulted her on board a yacht belonging to his father.

Joyce's father is Ron Joyce, the billionaire owner of the doughnut chain Tim Hortons.

Kelly alleges that the incident happened in October of last year, when she traveled with a friend to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to celebrate her birthday.

Joyce, 48, met the two women and they went to his father's $30million yacht, Destination Fox Harb’r Too.

In and interview with the National Post, Kelly says she had consensual sex with Joyce when they first arrived, and that later in the evening he asked for a threesome with both women.

After the other woman refused, Kelly claims Joyce 'grabbed her arm and tried to pull her onto the bed with them.'

During this scuffle Kelly claimed she injured her wrist when she was thrown off the bed.

Later that night the Kelly and Joyce were in the hot tub, and that the incident happened when she got out of the tub, naked, and put on her robe.

'Steven Joyce, without warning, suddenly and inexplicably forced the plaintiff face down on a chaise lounge and subjected the plaintiff to a vicious sexual battery,' Kelly claims in court papers.

She also states she 'screamed that he was hurting her and she begged him to stop.'

Kelly, who had previously dated Joyce, said he was apologetic the next morning, but after speaking with a friend she realized the severity of the situation.

'It doesn’t matter if it’s on a $30-million yacht or in the street.” Ms. Kelly said. 'It affected me a lot more than I realized. As glamorous a surrounding as it was, it just wasn’t cool,' Ms. Kelly said.

'That is not what love looks like.'

Joyce's father said his son did not have his permission to be on the boat and then added; 'Everything I’ve heard so far is an accusation of a young person who was likely making allegations that are unfounded.'

Joyce also said his father had nothing to do with the incident and is named only because he owns the boat.

Kelly is seeking $5.7million in damages.
