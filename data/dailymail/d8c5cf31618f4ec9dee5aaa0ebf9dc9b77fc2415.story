A train carrying a load of military vehicles crashed into a semi-truck that was stranded on tracks near Chowchilla, California on Sunday afternoon.

The dramatic crash was caught on the cellphone camera of motorist a who was waiting at the rail crossing at Vista Avenue and Highway 99.

The truck driver had already exited the vehicle and was walking up and down the tracks trying to warn the oncoming train. Incredibly, no one was injured in the smash.

Stranded: The truck came to a stop at the worst possible place: over train tracks. The truck's driver can be seen running along the tracks trying to signal to the train

Impact: The train hits the stranded truck to the horror of onlookers

See Tae had seen the truck stopped directly over the tracks and began to film events as he realized a train was fast approaching the vehicle.

The truck's driver was frantically waving his arms in an attempt to signal to the oncoming train, but the train couldn't stop.

The moment of impact shows the train going straight through the truck leaving the cab relatively unscathed, but the trailer's cargo of packaged trail mix bursts out all over the tracks.

The mile-long train was carrying hundreds of Stryker armored personnel carriers from Washington to California, reports ABC30.

Another motorist, driving on the other side of the tracks, and fascinated by the semi's unusual cargo of military vehicles, was filming when he realized the train was going to plow through the truck.

Robin Thissen, driving with his parents on Highway 99, screamed when he realized what was about to happen, but kept recording.

'Stop, Dad, stop... oh my God, we are going to die!' he can be heard yelling.

Dusty trail: Despite the huge mess of trail mix and debris, the tracks were cleared within a few hours

He told ABC30 that had they been five or 10 seconds ahead of where they were he and his parents would have been involved in the accident.

'Is the truck going to fly into traffic in front of us? Is the train going to derail? Is there going to be an explosion?' he was thinking, he told ABC30.

'The truck was right in front of us, maybe another five or ten seconds we would have been in this truck lane, we would have been destroyed, we would have been killed in this.'

Despite the massive impact, no one on the train was hurt.

Pieces of the truck could be seen attached to the front of the train, but it was undamaged.
