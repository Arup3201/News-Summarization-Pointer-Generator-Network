Are you consumed by a fear of dirt and germs, obsessed with washing your hands? Do you repeat certain actions a set number of times or worry that your home may be burgled or ravaged by fire?

If so, you could be among one of the millions of people worldwide battling Obessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

OCD is a chronic mental health condition associated with obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour.

A sufferer is compelled to carry out repetitive actions or mental acts.

Often they feel they need to carry out their compulsion in order to prevent their obessession from becoming true.

For a sufferer obsessed with a fear of being burgled, they may feel compelled to check and re-check the locks on their doors and windows multiple times before being able to leave the house.

It is one of the most common mental health disorders, affecting between 1 and 2 per cent of the population, according to the charity OCD Action.

A test used by the Channel 4 show Embarrssing Bodies asks how you would react to a set of circumstances. It was developed by Dr Wayne Goodman of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

It features 25 key questions to give an insight as to whether a person is at risk of developing the condition.

Examples include: 'Are you over concerned with keeping objects (such as clothing, shopping, tools) in a perfect order, or arranged exactly?' and 'Do you repeat routine actions a certain number of times or until it just feels right?'

So far 
83,327 people have taken the OCD test, with 28 per cent of men scoring 
in the highest at risk category and 36 per cent of women found to be in 
the highest at risk category.

People living in northern England and Northern Ireland show the highest incidence of OCD.

Those
 in the 18 to 30 age bracket were at the highest risk of suffering OCD, 
with those aged between 56 and 60 found to be at lowest risk.

People
 working in the food, drinks and retail sectors were more prone to the 
condition, while IT workers were least likely to suffer OCD.

A test to establish whether you are at risk of developing OCD will be discussed on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies. So far of the 83,327 people who have taken the test, 28 per cent of men and 36 per cent of women scored in the highest risk category, while those living in northern England and Northern Ireland were shown to be most likely to suffer the condition. Those aged between 18 and 30 are most at risk of OCD, while people in the 56-60 age group are less likely to suffer the condition

OCD is categtorised by four stages, obsession, anxiety, compulsion and temporary relief.

A
 sufferer will become overwhelmed by a constant obsessive fear or 
concern, such as the possibility they will contract a serious illness 
through contact with germs.

Their
 thoughts will develop into an anxiety and intense stress causing them 
to develop a pattern of compulsive behaviour in order to reduce anxiety.

That behaviour will inspire temporary relief from the anxiety but the obsession and anxiety will return, and the cycle begins again.

A form of psychotherapy, known as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), can be successful in treating OCD.

With the right treatment, OCD can be managed very effectively with a likely reduction in the severity of the symptoms, helping achieve a good quality of life. In some cases, treatment can lead to a total cure.

The results of the tests will be discussed on tonight's episode of Embarrassing Bodies, on Channel 4 at 8pm.

The test assesses how much time a person spends each day consumed by their obsession, and how hard it is for you to control the compulsion. The results of the test are set to be discussed live on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies
