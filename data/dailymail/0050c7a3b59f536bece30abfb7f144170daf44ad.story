Looking for the ultimate Christmas wreath to make your neighbours green with envy? One luxury website has the answer, assuming you have £3 million to spare.

Studded with over 40 diamonds and rubies totalling over 138 carats, exclusive launches website, VeryFirstTo.com, is selling the ultimate Christmas wreath for a cool £2,835,000.

The 60cm wreath is made up of some of the most luxurious flowers and leaves in the world and is created by world-renowned Finnish Floral Designer, Pasi Jokinen-Carter.

That will make the neighbours jealous! A luxury website has unveiled the most expensive Christmas wreath studded with 16 Rubies and 32 diamonds totalling over 138 carats that is being sold for nearly £3m

His client portfolio includes the Royal households, country clubs, galleries, and film and TV production houses.

For this high-end commission Jokien-Carter has used Laurus, Lingonberry and Blueberry stems sourced from his country house in Finland - as they are not commercially available in the UK.

Speaking about his latest creation, he said: 'I am passionate about my craft and this recent invitation to create an exclusive wreath, using natural materials and diamonds, has been an exciting and exceptional project.'

The diamonds and rubies for the wreath are provided by 77 Diamonds, who offer the world's largest selection of loose diamonds, some 300,000, or over 70 per cent, of the world's finest polished diamonds.

Exquisite: The wreath is made up of rare flowers from Finland and once it wilts, the diamonds can be transformed into a bespoke piece of jewellery 

Tobias Kormind, co-owner of 77 
Diamonds, said: 'It is exhilarating to participate in curating a 
selection of gems that would create the most sparkling Christmas anyone 
could wish for; plus a very worthwhile investment for the future.'

The bad news? The dazzling wreath will only last twelve days - that's a cost of £236,250 per day.

However,
all is not lost because the stones from the wreath are removable and 
can be reattached to next year’s wreath, say the creators.

Alternatively, 77 Diamonds is offering the complimentary service of mounting them into a bespoke designed piece of jewellery.

Florist: The 60cm wreath has been created by top Finnish Floral Designer, Pasi Jokinen-Carter, whose clients include the Royal household

Marcel Knobil founder of VeryFirstTo, who is selling the wreath, said: 'We are delighted to be able to 
offer the world’s most expensive Christmas wreath as part of our ongoing
endeavor to offer truly exceptional newly launching luxury products and
experiences.'

And while the wreath may cost more than the average Briton could ever dream of earning in a lifetime, a donation of £1,000 from the sale will be made to The Prince’s Trust.
