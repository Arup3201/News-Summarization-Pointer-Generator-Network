Sabrina Bryan is the latest victim of the Dancing With The Stars brutal elimination process, despite earning the first perfect score for the entire season on Monday night.

The audience was astounded when the former Disney star, who until now had been dominating the hit reality dance show, was voted off and voiced their disapproval with loud booing.

The elimination is all the more stunning because Sabrina, the star of The Cheetah Girls, was also a favourite to win when she was eliminated in the sixth week of the regular show’s season five.

Devastated: Sabrina Bryan was shockingly booted off Dancing With The Stars on Tuesday's elimination show

The judges, Len Goodman, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli, all looked equally shattered when Sabrina’s name was announced.

After minutes of tense silence the results were read out and Sabrina's dance partner Louis Van Amstel looked absolutely heartbroken.

Sabrina smiled bravely through her disappointment and expressed her gratitude for the experience.

Brave face: Sabrina smiled bravely through her disappointment and thanked fans for keeping her on the show so far. On Monday's show she scored the first perfect score of the season

Sobbing: The former Disney actress breaks down in the arms of her dance partner Louis Van Amstel after

Total shock: Even the judges could not believe there ears and Carrie Ann Inaba looked in physical pain

The 28-year-old said: 'Every single person can understand what it feels like to get a second chance at something and this was my second chance.

'Last night was one of most beautiful nights I've ever had. It's been an absolute dream.'

Louis close to tears added: 'It's been a dream come true. I love you', before hugging Sabrina close.

In shock: Dancer partner Louis was just as devastated as Sabrina and told her he loved her

Tense: The other couple with the bottom overall scores was Apolo Ohno and partner Karina Smirnoff. All four look nervous just minutes before the results are read out

Sabrina said: 'Louis, I’m so grateful for you. I’m grateful for this experience and Dancing With the Stars honestly has been just an absolute dream.'

Sabrina’s emotional rumba during Monday night’s Country Night-themed show earned her 30 points — the first perfect score of season 15.

The dance was an interpretation of Sabrina's relationship with a drug-addicted ex-boyfriend.

'I went through a relationship where my boyfriend was really addicted to drugs because he couldn't even help himself,' she told her partner.

 'I was helpless. I couldn't do anything to help him.'

Relief: Apolo and Karina were overjoyed at being put through to the next week

Overjoyed: Apolo and Karina share an ecstatic hug after learning they are going through to next week's show

That score, combined with her score from last week’s show – where she again topped the leaderboard — put her at the top of the pack going into the program tonight.

Elimination from the show is decided 
based upon a combination of judges’ and viewer votes. The star with the 
lowest overall total is sent home and the votes were combined from the 
last two weeks

It was Sabrina  and Olympic speed skater Apolo Ohno — who also earned a perfect score last night — both had the lowest overall total and had to suffer the anxiety-ridden final few minutes before the fates of the couples was revealed. 

Sabrina had to face a similar disappointment in her first twirl on the ballroom back in season five, when she was praised by the judges, but ultimately kicked off the show early in the season.

Emotional: Emmett Smith and Cheryl Burke wait to see if they have been safely put through to next the round

Actress and model Kelly Monaco and Val
Chmerkovskiy and former NFL player Emmett Smith and Cheryl Burke were 
lowest on the leaderboard but were somehow saved.

Both couples jumped for joy when it was revealed they had made it to the next round.

Val joked: I'd already packed my bags!'

Beforehand: Sabrina chats to the show's presenters before the elimination and discusses when she was also voted off in series five in the same week

When it was time for the next three couples to be told if they were safe, Kirstie Alley plugged her ears and couldn't believe it when she found out she would be dancing next week.

Essentially the five lowest scoring couples were safe and one of the judge's three favourites acts was going to go home.

The show also featured a performance by Taylor Swift, keeping with the country theme, as well as from Jason Mraz.

Love song: Jason Mraz performs his new single I Won't Give Up during the show

The bearded crooner performed his new 
single I Won't Give Up and was accompanied by a performance from 
professional dancers Chelsie Hightower and Mark Ballas.

Taylor Swift's performance was electric and defiant.

The
22-year-old singer wowed the crowd with a fierce rendition of her 
latest hit Never Ever Getting Back Together, said to be about her 
ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal.

Pros: The performance was accompanied by a display from pro dancers Mark Ballas and Chelsie Hightower

And if she was sad about her very recent break-up with Connor Kennedy, 18, she certainly didn't show it.

The leggy singer looked stunning in black high-waisted black shorts and a black and white polka dot top with cute red bow tie.

She wore black flats to better strut around the stage and had her long hairy back in a ponytail.

Scarlet lips completed the look.

Ratings: Despite Hurricane Sandy ravaging the East Coast living million without power Tuesday's show drew a record breaking 14 million viewers

Next Monday’s show will feature the 
stars doing the 'fusion dance' performances, which head judge Len 
Goodman said would require the couples perform two styles of dance to 
one piece of music.

The couples were allowed to pick the 'fusion dance' for the other couples.

The
names of the contestants were put in a large mirrored ball and each 
pair got to choose the combination dances for the couple that was selected by the show's presenters.

And despite massive power outages in New York and surrounding areas 
because of Hurricane Sandy – at least 8 million homes -  DWTS clocked 
its biggest audience so far this season with 14 million viewers.

Diva: Taylor Swift wowed the crowd with a fierce rendition of We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together

Sexy ensemble: Taylor wore a pair of high-waisted shorts, a polka-dot top and bow tie

Next week’s presidential elections 
will also bring a change to the show’s schedule. The stars will perform 
on Monday, but there will be no results show — and elimination — on 
Election Day.

The full list
of celebrities returning next week to perform are Apolo Ohno, Kelly 
Monaco, Emmitt Smith, Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson, actors Gilles 
Marini and Kirstie Alley and TV personality Melissa Rycroft.

Because Shawn’s partner, Derek Hough, injured his neck, she will dance with Mark Ballas next week.

Defiant: Taylor showed no signs of being upset following her recent break up from Connor Kennedy
