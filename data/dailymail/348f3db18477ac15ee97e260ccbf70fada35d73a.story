Two years ago he was freed from a British prison because he supposedly had only months to live.

Little over a month ago he was 'at death's door', comatose and being kept alive with oxygen and an intravenous drip.

But yesterday Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi – the only man convicted of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland and killing 270 people – was again well enough to protest his innocence.

In better health: Abdelbaset Al Megrahi reclines at his home during yesterday's interview

The former Libyan intelligence officer, who is suffering from prostate cancer, claimed his role in the 1988 attack had been 'exaggerated'.

Megrahi has consistently denied involvement in the atrocity – thought to be motivated by tensions between Libya and the U.S. – that brought down the London to New York flight, killing all 259 on board as well as 11 on the ground.

He said: 'The West exaggerated my name. The facts will become clear one day and hopefully in the near future. In a few months from now, you will see new facts that will be announced.'

When filmed at the family's palatial Tripoli villa five weeks ago, a gaunt Megrahi was wearing an oxygen mask and attached to a drip. His family had to speak on his behalf as he lay unconscious.

But yesterday he was able to speak for himself. He had more colour in his cheeks, though still looked frail, as he said: 'Please leave me alone. I only have a few more days, weeks or months.'

An oxygen tank was among the medical equipment surrounding his bed but the Libyan, wearing a white head-dress, did not use an oxygen mask during his interview with the Reuters news agency.

Reclining on a cushion featuring a brightly coloured picture from the children's cartoon Pokemon, Megrahi described the trial – held under Scottish jurisdiction in Camp Zeist, a Dutch court – that led to his conviction as a farce.

He said: 'Camp Zeist Court is the smallest place on earth that contains the largest number of liars. I suffered from the liars at Camp Zeist Court more than you can imagine.'

Upon Megrahi's release from a Scottish jail, he returned to Libya, where he was hailed as a hero. Labour ministers repeatedly claimed the decision to free Megrahi, incensing Lockerbie victims' families, was taken solely by the Scottish Executive on 'compassionate grounds'.

But documents have now come to light showing that Labour secretly helped free Megrahi to appease Colonel Gaddafi, who was threatening to scupper oil contracts and unleash 'holy war' on Britain.

Megrahi said he had little knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's overthrow earlier this year and claimed Libyan opposition fighters had invaded his home and mistreated him.

'My house has been violated,' he said. 'They smashed the main door and stole my cars.'

He denied any role in the human rights abuses committed by the Gaddafi regime, saying: 'All my work was administrative. I've never harmed anyone in my life.'

Megrahi claimed he was being denied medical treatment, which he said was stipulated in the deal that saw him returned to Libya.

He is believed to have been taking a drug which costs £3,000 a month. With the fall of the Gaddafi regime, which funded him, his supply from the U.S. has been interrupted and in August the bomber's family made an astonishing appeal to Britain for help to prolong his life.

Megrahi said: 'I was treated badly when I came back. During the latest incidents, especially in the last month, I have a shortage of all my medicines. I have four pills left [of one of the medications].

'I want to die in my house, among my family. I hope to God that I will see my country united, with no fighting or war.'

He wore a checked shirt and had a white headdress wrapped loosely around his head.        

He claimed he was still in contact with Jim Swire, a father of one of the victims of the bombing who has disputed the court's findings.

He added: 'The day before yesterday, Dr Swire sent me an email to tell me that there is a new medicine. He is trying to help me. He told me how to get this medicine.'     

Al-Megrahi claimed he had little knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's overthrow and that the armed groups which toppled the dictator had invaded his home and mistreated him.

He said: 'I don't know anything about February 17th...that's not a question for a sick person.

'I hear airplanes overhead every day,' he said, referring to NATO planes which have bombed sites in Libya.       

'My house has been violated. They smashed the main door and stole my cars.'      

He said he was being denied medical treatment which he said was stipulated in the deal that saw him returned from Scotland to Libya.      

'I was treated badly when I came back. During the latest incidents, especially in the last month, I have a shortage of all my medicines.

'My doctor tells me to look for medicine like anyone else despite the agreement between us and Britain,' he said.

'I have four pills left.               

'I want to die in my house, among my family. I hope to God that I will see my country united, with no fighting or war. I hope the bloodshed will stop in Libya. I wish all the best for my country.'

Barrage: Anti-Gaddafi forces are continuing to attack Sirte where there have reports of an unfolding humanitarian crisis

Elsewhere in Libya, a Red Cross convoy carrying aid to relieve a worsening humanitarian crisis in Libya's besieged city of Sirte had to turn back after ant-Gaddafi forces unleashed a barrage of gunfire.             

Aid agencies say they are concerned about the welfare of civilians inside Sirte, the hometown of deposed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who are trapped by the fighting and running out of food, water, fuel and medical supplies.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took some supplies into Sirte last week, and it tried again on Monday, assembling a convoy of two trucks carrying accompanied by two four-wheel drive vehicles.

The convoy set off from a bridge a few kilometres west of Sirte but came to a halt after only about 100 metres because interim government forces started firing into the city.     

They fired a heavy barrage of mortars, artillery, rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft weapons just as the convoy was starting to move.

The ICRC convoy turned around and headed back west, away from Sirte.

An anti-Gaddafi commander at the scene, Ismail Al-Sosi, told reporters: 'The rebels secured the way for the International Red Cross to go but as soon as they entered the city they returned because of the militias firing. We did not start the firing. The militias started the firing.'          

Speaking just before the aborted attempt to get supplies into the city, Hishem Khadrawy, an ICRC official, said the humanitarian situation there was dire.        

He said: 'We're trying to provide medical assistance and oxygen to the hospital in Sirt,'said  'We are really concerned about the medical situation because of the conflict.'

Civilians fleeing the town spoke of many other people who were unable to leave and and faced deteriorating conditions.   

Boshnab Khalifa who managed to escape the city with his family said: 'We were in our apartment and then the wall was blown in by a rocket.

'The situation is very bad. Our family and our friends are trapped inside. They cannot get out. There are many families trapped inside, some have no gas for their cars, other (cars) have been damaged or destroyed.'     

Another resident fleeing Sirte, Mohammed Diap, claimed pro-Gaddafi militias were barring people from getting out.           

He said: 'There is no food, no water, no power. Some are trapped because there is no fuel, others are trapped because of the militias.

'The people who are trapped inside are in danger. There is random shelling everywhere.'

A city of about 75,000 people, Sirte holds symbolic importance. Gaddafi, known for his self-aggrandising gestures, transformed his birthplace from a sleepy fishing town into Libya's second capital.               

At his instigation, parliament often sat in Sirte and he hosted international summits at the Ouagadougou Hall, a marble-clad conference centre he had built on a desert plot in the south of the city.   

Nato is urging Libya's new government to ensure the security of arms caches left behind by the Gaddafi's regime.

Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said:  'It's a matter of concern if stockpiles of weapons are not properly controlled and monitored.'

He was answering questions about reports that thousands of SAM-7 portable surface-to-air missiles allegedly went missing after the collapse of the regime.

The United States and other Western nations are trying to reduce the global stock of such missiles, fearing they could fall into the hands of terrorists.

The small, easily concealable SAM-7s are considered obsolete by modern military standards but could pose a threat to civil airliners.

In Tripoli Libya's post-Gaddafi leaders have named a new Cabinet and vow to step down after the country is fully secured.

The announcement comes after weeks of political infighting stalled efforts to form a new government.

The head of the National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, and the de facto prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, say they'll stay in their posts until Moammar Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte is captured.

But they say they have signed a pledge 'not to take part in any future government in any way'.
