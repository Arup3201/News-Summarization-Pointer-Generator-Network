Raheem Sterling partied in a London nightclub until 3am - the day after he was ‘too tired’ to play for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia.

The Liverpool winger was joined at trendy Cirque le Soir near Carnaby Street by national team colleagues Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, just 24 hours after being left on the bench by manager Roy Hodgson, who revealed that Sterling had approached him the day before the 1-0 win in Tallinn complaining of tiredness.

After flying back to Manchester straight after the game on October 12, the London-born youngster was out in the capital the following night, along with Arsenal duo Welbeck and Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Sterling was on a scheduled day off from Liverpool and was in church on Monday afternoon.

He was back on Merseyside by Tuesday afternoon for training, to which he was pictured being driven by Jordan Henderson.

Last week, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers defended his young star, insisting Sterling had not refused to play for his country.

However, the revelations will heap more controversy on the 19-year-old as he prepares to face European champions Real Madrid in the Champions League at Anfield tonight.

Sterling and his representatives declined to comment on Tuesday night.
