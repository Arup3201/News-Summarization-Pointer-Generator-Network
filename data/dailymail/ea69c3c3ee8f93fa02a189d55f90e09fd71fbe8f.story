Nikola Zigic is the surprise name being linked with Arsenal as Arsene Wenger searches for a solution to Olivier Giroud's injury.

The 6ft 8in striker is a free agent having left Birmingham when his lucrative contract finished in July. Reports in his native Serbia say Zigic is due to travel to London for a medical ahead of signing a one year deal.

The one obstacle will be whether he can gain a work permit as Zigic has not played for his national side in recent months.

Shock: Nikola Zigic has been linked with a move to Arsenal as Arsene Wenger tries to solve his striker shortage following the injury to Olivier Giroud

Big man: At 6ft 8in, Zigic would certainly present problems in the air should he join the Gunners

Nikola Zigic signed for Birmingham for £6million in 2010.

He scored against Arsenal in the 2011 Carling Cup final, which the Blues won 2-1.

He scored 32 goals in 132 league games in two different divisions at St Andrew's

The striker’s agent told Serbian papers on Wednesday: ‘Wenger called me on Tuesday and stressed his desire to sign Zigic.

‘He was offered a contract until the end of the year, with a view to it being extended to 2015 – we’ll see what happens.’

Zigic, who is 34 next month, joined Birmingham in 2010 and scored against Arsenal in the 2011 Carling Cup final.

He also played a part in Birmingham's great escape from relegation at the end of last season.

The Blues needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One.

Shortage: Arsene Wenger is light on firepower up front and is looking to bring a striker in

Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Zigic scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Paul Caddis, who headed home to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status.

Wenger surprised many with his move for midfielder Kim Kallstrom in January but this could surpass that deal for shock value. On Tuesday, he said: 'We have plenty of players at centre forward. In England as soon as you have a problem, people want you to buy.'

Arsenal had an interest in Radamel Falcao but agent Jorge Mendes, fresh from finalising Angel di Maria's transfer, went from Manchester's Lowry Hotel to Monaco on Tuesday to discuss his client Falcao's move to Real Madrid.

Giroud may not make another appearance until next year after suffering a serious ankle injury in the dying moments of Saturday's 2-2 draw at Everton, shortly after scoring Arsenal's equaliser. Scans revealed he will miss at least four months.
