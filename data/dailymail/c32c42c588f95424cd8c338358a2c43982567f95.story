Brace yourselves, fashion fans - Kate Moss' collection for Topshop has landed, finally!

After a four-year hiatus, the supermodel's hotly anticipated range of festival-inspired clothing has just hit the flagship store and it's causing a furore in central London.

Mossoholics caused a stampede down at the high street mecca's store on Oxford Street tonight as Croydon's finest export turned up to launch her designs.

She's still got it! Kate Moss looked overjoyed - and a little overwhelmed - at the crowds gathered to see her launch her first collection with Topshop for four years

Crowds line the street waiting for model Kate Moss to launch her 15th Kate Moss Topshop collection at Topshop's flagship store on Oxford Street in London

Kate Moss takes to the stage in a gold and black striped suit to launch her latest collection at Topshop Oxford Circus - and incites a stampede!

The crowding was exacerbated by the tube
 strike: bewildered commuters braving the reduced service were trying to
 pile into an overcrowded Oxford Street station at the same time as fashion fans were gathering.

The supermodel finally appeared at around 6.10, at which point thousands of fans were waiting impatiently, camera phones poised.

Kate strutted onto the stage erected outside the main store entrance, wearing a sparkling black blazer and matching trousers, from her own collection, naturally.

The model, although certainly used to huge amounts of attention, appeared almost overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crowd.

Kate joined Radio One DJ Nick Grimshaw on stage - however, the only thing she said once the Radio 1 DJ introduced her was: 'Happy shopping'. Oh well.

She disappeared after her brief appearance to go for a private dinner with friends and supporters - including Cara Delevingne and Sienna Miller - who were browsing the rails inside the store.

Selected friends, family and supporters had been invited
inside for a special VIP preview. Guests included Mary McCartney, sister of designer Stella 
McCartney, Linda Shepherd - Kate Moss' mother - and Sienna Miller.

But fashion fans should not worry about missing out: 346 Topshop stores across 41 countries
 will stock the collection from tomorrow morning, but judging by 
tonight's activity, you better get there early.

House
 or office bound? Don't panic, the full range will be available on 
Topshop.com and 38 styles will be up for grabs on Netaporter.com.

The model's SS14 collection is full of Seventies-style pieces, including fringed suede jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses.

There are also embroidered smock-tops, silk blouses and graphic print kaftans that will go on sale in high street stores globally and online.

Kate is said to have taken 
inspiration from her own wardrobe, which, despite her status as a 
supermodel, isn't just full of designer labels. She's also a fan of 
scouring the rails of second-hand stores.

A weave waistcoat, suede shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in keeping with the Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a jacket the 40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which she refers to as her 'gig jacket'.

A £130 pansy dress, which still changes hands on eBay seven years after it hit the shopfloor, will be on sale.

As well as channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laidback style. 

There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use satin material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the beach in over the summer.

For evening wear, there are sexy frilled flapper style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh. Many of the dresses are also in keeping with the vintage-feel with fringing, sequins and  crepe satin.

Crowds were queuing to get a glimpse of the supermodel - and also to see if they could get their hands on pieces like these, from her latest collection

Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces for smart office wear including tuxes and trouser suits and summery floral printed shirts.

While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey £600. In fact, a staggering 17m beads were used to create the fringed jackets and camis in the range.

The high price tag is to reflect the handiwork that went into creating the densely hand-beaded dress.

Kate first collaborated with Topshop in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects.

The mother-of-one announced last year that she would be reprising her role as a designer for the British brand.

Commuters express outraged that a difficult journey home caused by the Tube strike was made worse by the Kate Moss launch on Oxford Street

Topshop's Sir Philip Green, who counts the model as a friend, said he was delighted she decided to return to his fashion stable.

He said: 'I am personally thrilled that Kate wanted to come back to Topshop to work with us again. The first time around was such a lot of fun and she has been sorely missed. The Topshop business has developed extensively around the globe since we launched with Kate in 2007.'

Kate added: 'I have really missed being involved in the design process, and working with the team at Topshop. I am very excited to create a new collection that bears my name.

'Now more than ever with London being at the forefront of fashion as it feels like I'm back home.'

However, not everybody on Oxford Street was delighted by Kate Moss' arrival in the city centre during rush hour in the middle of a crippling tube strike.

Outraged commuters took to Twitter to vent their collective spleens.
