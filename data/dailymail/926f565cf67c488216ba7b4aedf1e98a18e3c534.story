Exhausting: Anna Soubry's work may have triggered a bout of pneumonia

Outspoken minister Anna Soubry has admitted her present defence job is much more ‘civilised’ than the health one she left last year.

Miss Soubry was public health minister from 2012 to 2013 during a turbulent time when she had to deal with calls for the plain packaging of cigarettes and minimum alcohol pricing.

But at the last reshuffle, she was moved to the Ministry of Defence to become minister for defence personnel, welfare and veterans – a job she says is less ‘demanding’.

In an interview with House magazine, the former This Morning presenter said she works so hard as an MP that  it may have caused a recent bout of pneumonia.

She said: ‘I plough my furrow, I work hard in my constituency. I work seven days a week: it’s exhausting, which is why I’ve had pneumonia.

'But this job is nothing like as demanding as my old job – this is completely civilised.

‘I get to see more of everything, more of my constituents, more of the girls for sure, more of my Neil as well, so it’s tons better.’

Miss Soubry said that the fact she was MP for the marginal seat of Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire meant that it was a ‘seven day a week job’.

‘I haven’t looked at my emails today but when I leave here and go back to my flat I will then look at my emails,’ she said.

‘And you would think they would be about Europe or the state of the economy. No they will be about the state of someone’s pothole. And lots of issues like greenbelt.’

She added she felt ‘vindicated’ that the government had decided to revive plans for plain packaging of cigarettes after earlier going cold on the idea.

And she said it was ‘rubbish’ that the Tories’ election strategist Lynton Crosby - who has been linked to lobbying for the tobacco industry - had blocked the scheme.

‘I think the problem was we had the consultation before we had the debate,’ she said. ‘Because we had the consultation first, we allowed the tobacco companies to take the debate and twist it and turn it around.’

She described the recent vote in favour of banning smoking in cars in front of children as ‘briliant’.
