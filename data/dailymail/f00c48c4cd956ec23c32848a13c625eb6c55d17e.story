Magic Johnson is at the center of the racism scandal surrounding the LA Clippers owner but new reports reveal that he may be plotting a bigger role in the eventual ending.

The former NBA superstar is reportedly vying for a chance to own the Clippers himself, and is hoping that the recording that features the team's current owner Donald Sterling making racist comments about African-Americans may help Johnson get back in the game.

'Magic's absolutely interested,' a NBA source told Yahoo News.

New leadership? Magic Johnson is reportedly interested in buying the LA Clippers amid the racism scandal surrounding the team's coach, Donald Sterling

The retired player is the most famous member of Guggenheim Partners, a financial services firm worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and has worked with them to buy professional sports teams in the past.

This wouldn't be the first time that Johnson and Guggenheim Partners bought an area team, as they paid $2.15billion for the LA Dodgers in 2012.

More recently, they tried to buy the LA Lakers but the Buss family that owns the team refused a sale. 

The investment group made another big buy in February, effectively bailing out the area's women's basketball team, the Sparks, when it was about to fold.

Analysts have speculated that the move wasn't so much out of equal opportunity goodwill, but really in an effort to get on the good side of the NBA administrators in order to make a future purchase of a men's team more likely.

'This is 100 per cent Magic's plan,' an anonymous league official told Yahoo.

Not quite a reality: Sterling (left) cannot be forced into a sale by the team or the NBA but Johnson (right) and his investment team have a history of buying local sports franchises

The
 fact that Johnson has already been an unintended character in the 
racism scandal just makes the hypothetical solution fit even more 
nicely.

The controversial recording was released over the weekend and is believed to show Sterling condemning his girlfriend V. Stiviano for posting a picture of she and Johnson on her Instagram feed.

He goes on in lengthy recording, telling her: 'Don't put him (Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.'

A sale to Johnson and the Guggenheim group is far from a done deal, however, as there is no way that the Clippers organization can oust Sterling, who bought the team for $12million in 1981.

Owner's spot: Johnson and his financial partners bought the LA Dodgers baseball team for $2.15billion in 2012 and he is a regular at the games (at the 2014 season opener and at right a week later)

The Daily Beast suggests that given the current climate of overpaying for relatively-unknown teams, the current pricetag for the Clippers could be boosted from $575million to $1billion.

That leaves any and all action in the hands of the NBA which can really only issue fines and temporary penalties but cannot force him to give up the team.

'If the owners can't force (Sterling) to sell, they need to be held accountable to change the bylaws so they can,' an unidentified member of the NBA's board of governors told Yahoo.

'A fine and suspension is meaningless, and that'll be seen as a lack of acceptance that the league and owners are responsible for this a******.'
