There is something vaguely disconcerting about the sight of Adrian Chiles with a smile playing on his pudgy lips, not least because he usually bears such a strong resemblance to a lugubrious Toby jug.

Yet there is no doubt that the perennially gloomy TV presenter has plenty to be jovial about at the moment — this week the 45-year-old was photographed canoodling with his girlfriend, comedienne Catherine Tate.

He and Miss Tate, 44, were kissing and cuddling like lovestruck teenagers in a park in Santa Monica, California, she sporting a slouchy, tartan shirt-dress, while he wore a pair of faded cargo shorts of the type that might constitute warm weather attire on any British building site.

The fact that the Chiles-Tate liaison is already nearly a year old apparently means they’re well past the stage where they’re dressing up to the nines for each other. But what they lack in sartorial punch, they certainly make up for in easy togetherness.

Clearly, it is not an interest in fashion that unites the pair. In fact, surprisingly, they have bonded over a mutual and deep faith in God.

‘They are both devoutly religious,’ a friend and colleague of Worcestershire-born Chiles told the Mail this week. ‘I’m pretty sure they have also gone to church together from time to time, and they pray together.

‘It’s not something either of them really talks about, but their faith is very important. They’re not happy-clappy or evangelical, they just share a love of God.’

Looking at them, it is certainly hard to imagine a more content-looking couple. One Los Angeles-based Briton, who saw the couple out in the city this week, told me: ‘They were window shopping in the sunshine, but every time they stopped, or waited to cross the road, he had his hand on her stomach like an expectant father would.

‘Maybe it’s that they are so comfortable with each other and he’s just the tactile type, but my immediate thought was: “I wonder if she’s pregnant?” ’

Whatever the case, Miss Tate’s relationship with Chiles is progressing apace, to the extent that in the summer he flew his lover out to Poland, from where he was presenting ITV’s coverage of the Euro 2012 football tournament, and, apparently, took her on a ‘date’ to the Auschwitz death camp.

So what is the story behind their spiritual connection?

Chiles, who was brought up in the Anglican church but converted to Catholicism five years ago, is understood to have introduced convent school-educated Miss Tate to a select group of his religious mentors over the past year.

Key figures in his life include Father Ben O’Rourke, an Augustinian Friar who lives at Clare Priory in Suffolk, and John Maguire, a television director and, like Chiles, an avid West Bromwich Albion fan, who acted as his ‘sponsor’ during his conversion.

Understandably, both men are protective of their protege.

‘I couldn’t say anything without talking to Adrian about it first,’ Mr Maguire told me this week.

However, other friends admit that Chiles and Miss Tate — famous for her catchphrase ‘Am I bovvered?’ — are uncannily similar.

Both confess to being natural-born worriers and pessimists, and both have seen long-term relationships founder — all of which makes their public display of affection all the more endearing.

Miss Tate is understood to be renting a house close to the Pacific in LA, where she is filming the U.S. version of The Office. Sources in Hollywood say she has been commuting between London and the programme’s set since early May.

After appearing on-and-off in the show as socially inept Briton Nellie Bertram for the past 18 months, Miss Tate plays a much bigger part in the current series, which began airing last week in the States.

She has become something of a regular fixture in the starry  enclave of Santa Monica, but, as a  non-drinker, she avoids the British-style pubs where LA-based expat actors congregate.

Happy couple: Rumours that Miss Tate, 44, and Mr Chiles, 45, were dating first emerged a year ago

Rumours that she and Chiles were dating first emerged a year ago.

And in July this year Miss Tate, who has a nine-year-old daughter, Erin, with her ex-partner, was photographed on the back of Chiles’s motorbike in London, wearing  knee-high boots.

But their nascent love affair was dealt what might have been a terminal blow by the arrival on the scene at the end of last summer of Take That’s Jason Orange.

Catherine and the handsome 42-year-old singer met when she played him in a spoof version of the band for Comic Relief in March last year.

When she and Jason were introduced during the filming of the sketch, people on the set at the time say, she confidently asked the lantern-jawed singer for his number.

Meanwhile, members of Jason’s inner circle told me this week that Little Britain comic David Walliams acted as matchmaker between the two after Miss Tate and Jason went to cheer him on when he swam the Thames for charity last year.

But they made an unlikely couple — a view shared by countless  Take That fans who went on internet forums to accuse Miss Tate in unflattering terms of punching above her weight.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, her relationship with the pop star cooled around Christmas, when she stayed at home and Jason went off to detox at a Thai spa famous for its colonic irrigation and yoga in Koh Samui.

With Jason off the scene, Chiles made a sudden re-emergence in  the life of the often-troubled  comedy star.

Born Catherine Ford on the Brunswick Centre council estate in London’s Bloomsbury, she never knew her father, who split from  her mother, Josephine, before she was born.

Bullied for having ginger hair, Catherine was afflicted as a child by a strange obsessive-compulsive disorder linked to the letters of the alphabet. One symptom meant she was convinced something terrible would happen if she left her jumper on the floor, because it began with the same letter as her mother’s name.

After attending the Catholic Notre Dame school in Southwark, South London, she won a place at Central School of Speech and Drama and took a string of bit parts before being spotted performing at the Edinburgh Fringe by a casting director. A role in the sitcom Wild West, with Dawn French, followed, before she was given her own BBC2 show in 2004.

But even as she was filming the first series of The Catherine Tate Show, she was succumbing to the trauma of acute postnatal depression following the birth of her daughter.

Her then partner, Twig Clark, from whom she split last summer, gave up work as a stage manager to help her cope with the baby. Clark now has a flat around the corner from the £800,000 mews house where Catherine and Erin live in East Sheen, West London.

Friends says the split has been amicable. Clark is regularly seen arriving in the morning to do the school run, and Erin often stays overnight with her father.

Catherine’s career success has done little to lift the impression the comedienne gives of being shrouded by a pall of melancholy and angst.

Until recently, she fretted that Erin would choke on her breakfast cereal while she was away filming, and admits to suffering panic attacks, which she has sought to dispel with a rather obsessive interest in, among other things, astrology and the alignment of the planets.

‘I’m an incredibly negative person,’ she says. ‘I’ve realised I need a gnawing, nagging, anxious doubt when I wake at 4am.’

Which is where, one imagines, the overcast Adrian Chiles comes in. After all, he has made a career of his distinctly downbeat demeanour.

He married Jane Garvey, now a presenter of Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, in 1998, but they divorced three years ago on the grounds of his unreasonable behaviour. They have two daughters, Evelyn, 12, and nine-year-old Sian.

Adrian did a disastrous stint with his former One Show co-host Christine Bleakley on ITV’s Daybreak. Their reunion in September 2010 lasted until December last year, when they were axed as ratings tumbled.

There had long been rumours about the nature of Chiles’s relationship with Miss Bleakley, which was warm and affectionate and involved after-work curries at his West London flat.

But their friendship cooled when Ulster-born Christine began dating Chelsea and England footballer Frank Lampard three years ago.

Judging by how things looked this week, however, it would seem that Chiles’s relationship with Miss Tate is hotting up very nicely.
