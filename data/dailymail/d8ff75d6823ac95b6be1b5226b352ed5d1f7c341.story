Don't put away those snow plows just yet!

A mid-summer thunderstorm dumped more than a foot of hail in the town of Santa Rosa, New Mexico.

It meant the fire department had to bring out snow plows to clear streets that were clogged with ice from hail drifts.

According to the National Weather Service in Albuquerque, golf ball-sized hail pelted the city.

Snow plows required: More than a foot of hail covered streets, yards and parking lots thanks to golfball-sized hail

Actually it's normal: It's not uncommon for hail to fall during the summer months in New Mexico

The storm caused severe damage to many homes, cars and businesses.

However, although the weather is certainly unseasonal for July, it's not uncommon in the High Plains of New Mexico.

In part, this is due to the higher elevation. Santa Rosa sits at 4,616 feet above sea level.

Northeast New Mexico sits in what meteorologists call 'Hail Alley', an area that stretches from southeast Wyoming and northeast Colorado to northeast New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle.

Large hail falls on average at least three days a year.
