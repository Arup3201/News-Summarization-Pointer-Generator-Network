Many fliers often switch off when airlines deliver the staid FAA's in-flight safety guidelines.

But this new musical offering by Virgin America is guaranteed to get passengers' attention... even if they find it annoying.

The video features 36 dancers and former 
contestants from So You Think You Can Dance and American Idol - singing rapping dancing and contortion all play a part in the five-minute film.

New venture: This new musical offering by Virgin America is guaranteed to get passengers attention... even if they find it annoying

The video uses 14 dance styles to spell out the pre-flight instructions and features singing air hostesses and dancing nuns.

It also includes humourous asides in the instructions such an air hostess saying: 'For the .001% of you who have never operated a seat belt before — really?' 

Debuting today on screens across America including Times Square, the video was created by filmmaker Jon Chu who worked on Step Up 2, Step Up 3,  Justin Bieber's 3D concert film Never Say Never and G.I. Joe: Retaliation.

'I'm a visual learner myself and making it fun and entertaining made a big difference for me,' said Mr Chu.

'I wanted to make sure this video lived up to that promise and pushed the envelope. I think we've successfully taken Virgin America into new, uncharted territory with this safety video, and I really hope to see people doing their own versions of the safety dance soon.'

'The most important aspect of any safety video is that people actually pay attention to it. Too often the dry, perfunctory safety messaging used in the past was tuned out.

'We believe we were successful with our original video in creating a message that resonated. Using the universal languages of music and dance, we think even more people will pay attention, and hopefully be entertained at the same time,' said Steve Forte, Chief Operating Officer at Virgin America.

'Some of the airlines get a little creative, but it's all the same information that you have to provide,' she told USA Today.

The cult favorite will still be featured onboard the airline's entertainment platform, but the new VX Safety Dance video will be played to fliers in mid-November.
