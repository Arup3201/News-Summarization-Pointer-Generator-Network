Ebola-stricken NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is still fighting off the dreaded virus, but the 33-year-old was well enough Thursday to poke fun at a congressional hearing about the disease.

'"Do dogs spread Ebola?" this hearing is really something else,' Mukpo tweeted as he watched lawmakers grill the CDC chief from his Nebraska hospital bed.

Earlier this week Mukpo, whose progress has doctors 'really, really pleased,' was well enough to return to social media just as the potentially deadly journey was beginning for two Dallas nurses.

Well enough to tweet: Ebola-stricken NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is still fighting off the dreaded virus, but the 33-year-old was well enough Thursday to poke fun at a congressional hearing about the disease

'Do dogs spread Ebola': The journalist and human rights advocate had some fun at the hysterical Congress's expense

Mukpo acknowledged the nurses, in a general way at least, when he tsked the Congressmen and their televised outrage Thursday.

'Settle down guys, health workers and people in west Africa r the ones at risk,' Mukpo tweeted.

Mukpo continued:  

'So far the only people who have contracted Ebola and who weren't in SL, guinea, or Liberia recently are health workers.'

Mukpo posted on Twitter on Monday afternoon: 'Back on twitter, feeling like I'm on the road to good health. Will be posting some thoughts this week. Endless gratitude for the good vibes.'

His positive outlook appeared all the more impressive when it was revealed the freelance human rights advocate would be made to cover his own $500,000 medical expenses.

A GoFundMe page was created in order to crowd fund the half-million dollar hospital bill.

But then, as his health improved on Wednesday, Mukpo's financial outlook appeared to be improving as well when the GoFundMe page was updated to reflect the NBC decision to pay his mounting bills.

This, despite Mukpo having only worked or the network a very short time.

The fundraising goal has now been lowered considerably and 'will now be directed toward replacing all of Ashoka’s gear and possessions...covering his travel expenses and helping him to recover and rebuild his life.'

The NBC News cameraman who is infected with Ebola is the son of a renowned Tibetan monk responsible for bringing Buddhism to the West in the 1970s. His mother is an English aristocrat who was seduced at age 15 by the guru and married him at 16.

When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam  Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama.

Mr Mukpo later traveled to Tibet, where he was enthroned and honored as the ninth reincarnation of Khamnyon Rinpoche, 'the Mad Yogi of Kham.'

A further twist in the cameraman's life: Trungpa, who is considered his father, is not his biological dad. His biological father is actually Mitchell Levy - a Jewish doctor from New York who was Trungpa's personal physician - whom his mother Lady Diana Mukpo was sleeping with at the time.

Ashoka's mocking tweets came Thursday came as--in the face of skepticism in Congress--health officials tried to assure the nation Thursday that they can head off an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. despite mistakes that let the deadly virus spread to two nurses and cleared one of them to fly.

The revelation that one of the hospital nurses was allowed on a commercial airline the day before she was diagnosed raised new alarms about the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Some lawmakers pressed for a ban on travel to the U.S. from the region - a course President Barack Obama is resisting.

The death toll is expected to climb above 4,500 in Africa, all but a few within Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the World Health Organization said.

Obama directed his administration to respond in a 'much more aggressive way' to the threat and, for a second day in a row, canceled his out-of-town trips to stay in town and monitor the Ebola response. He was calling foreign leaders and U.S. lawmakers to discuss what more must be done, the White House said, and bringing his Cabinet members together on the matter.

But a ban on travel to the U.S. from the Ebola-stricken countries is not under consideration, spokesman Josh Earnest reiterated Thursday.

Obama believes the U.S. already is taking the necessary steps to protect the public by screening passengers as they depart West Africa and again when they enter the U.S., Earnest said. 

Ashoka's mocking tweets came Thursday came as--in the face of skepticism in Congress--health officials tried to assure the nation Thursday that they can head off an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. despite mistakes that let the deadly virus spread to two nurses and cleared one of them to fly.

The first nurse stricken in the U.S., Nina Pham, who contracted Ebola after treating a Liberian man at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was being flown to the National Institutes of Health outside Washington on Thursday, while a second nurse has already been transferred to a biohazard infectious disease center at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

The two nurses, Pham and Amber Joy Vinson, had been involved in providing care to Thomas Duncan, who died of Ebola last week.

In a hearing on Capitol Hill, the chairman of a House committee cited 'demonstrated failures' in the government's response. Rep. Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania said the 'trust and credibility of the administration and government are waning as the American public loses confidence each day.' Seated before him were leaders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the NIH.

Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, testified that despite the latest incidents, 'we remain confident that our public health and health care systems can prevent an Ebola outbreak here.'

In his prepared testimony, the Texas hospital's chief clinical officer, Dr. Daniel Varga, admitted the facility had made mistakes in Duncan's initial treatment, he apologized for that.

'We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola,' Varga said. 'We are deeply sorry.' Duncan was initially sent home from the emergency room with antibiotics for his high fever, despite saying he'd come from Liberia.

Varga testified to the committee by video conference.
