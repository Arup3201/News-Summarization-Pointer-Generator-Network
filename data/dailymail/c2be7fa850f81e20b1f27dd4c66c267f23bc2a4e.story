Police have found a sizable piece of one of the engines from a plane that crashed into the World Trade Center, more than 11 years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

The piece of landing gear was found wedged between two buildings just blocks from Ground Zero- in between the buildings at 51 Park Place and 50 Murray Street in downtown Manhattan.

The location is particularly noteworthy because 51 Park Place is the site of the Islamic Cultural Center that stirred up controversy and months of protests two years ago when the site developers wanted to turn it into a mosque.

Found: part of a landing gear from one of the 9/11 planes was discovered wedged between buildings with a mysterious rope around it

Close: The debris was found lodged in a tiny alley at 51 Park, mere blocks from Ground Zero

Just before 7pm Friday, New York City Police Commissioner
Raymond Kelly arrived on the scene and was escorted inside the rundown
building, where he put on a  crime scene suit and was led to the site of the
unexpected discovery.

In a press conference that took place across the street
about 30 minutes later, Kelly told reporters that Wednesday surveyors
were working in the narrow space when they came across an unidentified
mechanical part. 

Police received a report about the discovery, but officers
who responded were not sure what the large piece of metal was resting in a very
confined space littered with debris. Kelly then showed reporters a hand-drawn
diagram of the scene made on a small piece of paper.

A short time later, the FBI, the National Transportation
Safety Board and the Medical Examiner’s Office were notified. Pilots who were
consulted ruled that the large piece of steel measuring 5 feet by 4 feet by 17
inches at one time was part of a plane’s landing gear.

Kelly said that mechanical part was wedged in narrow space measuring about 18 inches, and according to Kelly, a rope
could be seen intertwined with the steel.

Police officers cordoned off the section of Park Place
surrounding the site of the discovery located inside a former Burlington Coat
Factory department store, which was controversially turned into an
Islamic center and mosque just blocks away from the World Trade Center site.

NYPD deputy commissioner Paul Browne told CBS radio Friday afternoon, 'No, it has not been known that its 
been there,' Browne said, denying that the building owners were aware 
that their back alley contained a piece of evidence from the 2001 
terrorist attack.

'It 
was just only recently observed because it's wedged between a very 
narrow space between the rears of two buildings that almost touch.'

Kelly said that the investigation will look at
the possibility that the part had been somehow lowered down into the narrow
space. The gear has a serial number visible next to the word ‘Boeing.’

It is unclear which of the two planes the new-found part belonged to, as both were Boeing aircrafts.

Kelly said that on Monday,
the medical examiner will investigate to determine if there are any
human remains at the site, and it will then be determined how to move the
plane remnants.

‘It’s a manifestation of a horrific terrorist act,’ Kelly
said, adding that this latest discovery may bring up difficult memories for the
families of the victims.

Van Vanable, 63, a construction worker with Benson Industry
Local 580, has been working on the yet-to-be completed Freedom Tower just a few
blocks away.

On Friday, he was sitting on a bench in his red work helmet
just steps away from the mosque building, next door to the Dakota Roadhouse
bar, when he says police officers converged on the area.

‘It’s an amazing situation,’ Vanable said of the discovery
made nearly 12 years after the 9/11 attacks.

The 63-year-ld construction worker, who lives in Harlem,
came to Ground Zero a week after the tragedy and joined the massive cleanup
effort hauling away debris. Speaking to MailOnline, Vanable said he is not
surprised by the find.

The inspectors were the ones to call police and since that call, the NYPD has secured the scene as if it were a crime scene in order to document it and catalog evidence.

'We're going to treat this as a crime scene for the next week at least,' Browne said.

'The medical examiner is an important part of the investigation to first see if there's any contamination of the soil that makes it any health safety on the soil below it on the ground. And then they will then make a determination, the office of the medical examiner, as to whether to sift for any possible human remains that might be associated with this find,' Browne said.

Today's discovery of the sizable portion of a plane fuselage is not the first time that evidence from the tragic day were found on the streets of lower Manhattan.

In previous years, large pieces from United Flight 175’s jet engines were found blocks away from where the planes crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

Those pieces, along with a 31-foot section of the broadcast antenna from the WTC's North Tower were shown as part of an FBI evidence exhibit that ran at Washington, DC's Newseum through 2012.

A 10,000 pound elevator motor was also taken from the ruins and has become part of another exhibit at the 9/11 Memorial at Ground Zero.

Small artifacts, like countless cell phones and even tinier human remains continue to be uncovered.

About 60 truckloads of debris that could contain tiny fragments of bone or tissue were unearthed by construction crews that have been working on the new World Trade Center in recent years.

Around 9,000 pieces of human remains too degraded for DNA matching have so far been found.

More than 1.6 million tons of materials were moved from Ground Zero to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, and family members of some victims later sued saying the debris could contain human remains. The lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.

New sifting efforts this month, the first since 2010, have so far uncovered at least 6 potential human remains from debris transported to a park atop the Staten Island landfill.

Some 2,750 people died at the WTC in the 2001 attacks, but only 1,634 people have been identified. Some degree of closure came for dozens of families as 34 new positive identifications of victims have been found since 2006.
