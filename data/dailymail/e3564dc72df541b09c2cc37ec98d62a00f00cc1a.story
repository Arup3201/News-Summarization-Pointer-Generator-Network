For the first time in three decades, the nation's most common sexually transmitted disease is on the decline.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Tuesday that the rate and number of chlamydia (pronounced kluh-MID'-ee-uh) cases fell by 1.5per cent in 2013.

But there were still 1.4 million new cases reported - more than any other sexually transmitted disease. Experts are not sure what to make of the one-year drop.

The rate in women decreased by 2.4per cent, while the rate in men increased by 0.8per cent.

The drop in cases follows a spike over the previous four years; the  report stated that between 2009 and 2013, the chlamydia rate in men increased 21per cent, compared with a 6.2per cent increase in women during the same four-year period.

The disease's prevalence also varied by racial and ethnic minority populations. 

For example, in 2013, the chlamydia rate in blacks was 6.4 times the rate in whites and the rate among American Indians and Alaska natives was almost four times the rate among whites.

STD screening: A urine test such as the one pictured can detect chlamydia, which is easily treated with antibiotics

Chlamydia is easily treated with antibiotics. Untreated, it can damage a woman's reproductive system.

According to the CDC, chlamydia can be contacted through vaginal, anal or oral sex with someone who has the disease.

While most people who have chlamydia have no symptoms, they may experience an abnormal discharge or a burning sensation when urinating several weeks after sex with an infected partner.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that gonorrhea cases declined by less than 1per cent. 

The numbers for the most contagious forms of syphilis rose about 10per cent - to 17,375. The increase was mainly among gay men.
