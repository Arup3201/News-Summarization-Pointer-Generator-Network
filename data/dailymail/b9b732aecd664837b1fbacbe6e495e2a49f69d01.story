The final afternoon at Medinah in 2012, and the scoreboard for the first time is showing an ocean of European blue.

Captain Jose Maria Olazabal is waiting on the 12th tee for Lee Westwood, who is in the third-last match out.

‘Do you know, I think we can win this,’ said the Spaniard to his most experienced player, with tears in his eyes. And Westwood is thinking: ‘Oh Christ, this is just what I need to see.’

At home in Florida, there are photographs of some of Westwood’s great moments during an immense Ryder Cup career stretching back to 1997. There’s one highlighting a wonderful putt he holed to snatch a half in a fourballs match in Detroit in 2004 alongside Sergio Garcia.

There are pictures detailing some of the fine partnerships he’s forged along the way with Darren Clarke, Sir Nick Faldo and the aforementioned Sergio. But what happened in 2012, and a singles match largely overlooked because of the drama happening elsewhere, deserves its own consideration.

For this was the first of his eight Ryder Cups where Westwood was not playing the role of ‘thou shalt not pass’. He was struggling with his game. Now here he was, all square in a match against Matt Kuchar with his captain laying it all on the line.

Talk about pressure.

Since his 1997 debut, Westwood has earned 21 points and been a key man in six victorious Ryder Cup teams. He has been on the losing side twice.

                             P     W      L       H

Singles                 8      3       5       0

Foursomes          15     7       4       4

Fourballs             14     8       4       2

Total                    37    18     13      6

‘I knew I needed to put my foot down and get the momentum in this game, and I did,’ he recalled. ‘I won the 12th and the 13th and then he holed from about 30ft for a half on 14. But I won the 15th and now I was three up with three to play. It was nice to turn it on when it was needed.’

It’s also something he can draw upon as he contemplates a ninth appearance at Gleneagles next week, following a season where there have been few sightings of his awesome ball-striking of old.

But you would struggle to find many among the rank and file on the European Tour who would not have given him a wild card, even allowing for the fierce competition offered by Luke Donald.

Englishman Graeme Storm offered a typical view, saying: ‘I’d go for Westy every time. You need to hit it long and straight up there and it’s a course that will suit him rather than, say, Luke.’

Westwood has forged some formidable Ryder Cup partnerships, most recently with Sergio Garcia

Westwood has hinted that he could partner Welsh rookie Jamie Donaldson at Gleneagles

Unless something goes wrong during the practice days expect Westwood, 41, to partner Welsh rookie Jamie Donaldson in the fourballs on Friday morning.

‘Paul (McGinley) and I have discussed the possibility of me being paired with the rookies,’ he said. ‘It’s a role I’ve been playing in the last two or three matches (Martin Kaymer in 2010, Nicolas Colsaerts in 2012) and would happily take on again.

‘That first day is tough for them, and not too many get to play on the first morning. But if you have to go through it, it helps to be alongside an experienced player. 

Westwood was grateful he could rely on the experience of partner Nick Faldo at Valderrama in 1997

'I remember playing on the first morning at Valderrama in 1997 and it was one of those moments where you’re shaking so hard you’re wondering if you can get the ball to stay on the tee. It helped to have Nick (Faldo) as my partner. He told me to play aggressively and not to worry about messing up, that he’d be there. Hopefully I’m a similar mentor.

‘The first couple of Ryder Cups go by in a complete blur. Now I enjoy it a lot more. It’s an enormous privilege, and the more you play in, the more you can slow it down and take it all in.’

Having played in Ryder Cups in England, Wales and Ireland, he will next week become the first player to complete the set in Scotland. He’s witnessed the two greatest comebacks from both a winning and losing point of view — Medinah last time, Brookline in 1999 — and was hugely influential in record victories on US and European soil in 2004 and 2006. Has he got another great Ryder Cup left in him?
