A rabbi has been charged, for the third time, for impersonating a police office.

In all three cases, drivers say Rabbi Alfredo Borodowski flashed a badge and seemed to be angry that they were going too slowly.

The latest arrest stemmed from an encounter in Yonkers in April when 'what appeared to be minor road rage escalated,' state police Investigator Joseph Becerra said on today.

Charged: Rabbi Alfredo Borodowski appeared in court in Mamaroneck, New York. Borodowski pleaded not guilty to impersonating a police officer. He allegedly flashed a badge and ordered a motorist to pull over

Oy vey: Rabbi Alfredo Borodowski hasll appeared in court this week accused of impersonating a police officer and its believed there are likely to be other charges too

He said Borodowski angrily waved a badge at a driver who cut him off on Interstate 87.

'Words were exchanged,' Becerra said. The other driver and his passenger 'felt they were intimidated by this individual and he was purporting to be a police officer.'

The passenger videotaped some of the encounter, he said. The footage is not being released.Borodowski surrendered  at a state police barracks in Hawthorne and was charged with the misdemeanor form of criminal impersonation. 

He is due in court July 29.

The rabbi was already appearing in court today in Mamaroneck, just north of New York City, on his first arrest, which came in June.

His lawyer said Rabbi Borodowski suffers from bipolar disorder and recently was hospitalized.

The
rabbi who grew up in Argentina, is accused of pulling his car alongside
a woman's car, flashing a badge and shouting: 'Police! Police! Pull 
over!'

The woman's lawyer said he 'just laid on the horn and started screaming at her' as she obeyed a 20-mph limit in a school zone.

Police
said the rabbi told them, 'That girl was driving too slow, and I hate 
when people do this.' However, he denied posing as a police officer.

He said that he was simply telling the woman that he would be 'calling the police.'

The rabbi has been dismissed from a position at the Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan

He had a badge, which read Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Officer 1338, which has been confiscated by police.

Judie
Glave, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
which oversees the bridge and tunnel authority, said the badge is 
'totally fake.'

Borodowski's
lawyer, Andrew Rubin, acknowledged that the rabbi's behavior has been 
'manic' and said he's suffering from bipolar disorder.

Prosecutor Diana Hedayati agreed to reduce the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor. The revision means the rabbi is much less likely to be jailed if he's found guilty.

The Westchester district attorney's office said the charge was reduced from felony status because the rabbi's behavior did not include intent to commit another crime while impersonating an officer.

Judge Daniel Gallagher ordered a psychiatric evaluation and adjourned that case to Sept. 12.

Borodowski did not speak during the proceeding and refused to answer questions outside the courthouse. Richard Clifford, a lawyer representing the woman who reported him, said he was not disappointed that the charge was reduced.

'Putting everyone in jail is not a solution,' he said.

Borodowski is still listed as rabbi on the website for Congregation Sulam Yaakov in Larchmont (pictured)

In
the first incident which happened in White Plains, New York, but only 
came to light after the Mamaroneck arrest, motorist Peter Moses said 
Borodowski tailgated him, 'obviously trying to make me go faster' than 
the 40-mph limit.

When
the rabbi pulled alongside, he shouted, 'I'm a police officer. Pull 
over!' Moses said. 'He's got this little badge that he's 
waving at us. I told my wife, "That's not a police officer.'

A third driver handed State Police a video of a confrontation in April on Interstate 87 near Yonkers.

The
man, who has not been named, claimed that he swerved in front of a 
driver who then flashed a badge and demanded that he pull over.

Preacher: The synagogue of Congregation Sulam Yaakov in Larchmont, New York where Rabbi Alfredo Borodowski is still listed as the leader of the congregation. Police in White Plains have accused him of doing the same thing there in May

'He
was holding up this tiny badge, and I knew the guy could no way be a 
cop in any sense of the word.'

The
three complaints prompted the trustees of Temple Emanu-El to fire Borodowski as executive director of the Skirball Center for Jewish 
Learning 'in the best interests of the Congregation,' said Mark 
Weisstuch, administrative vice president.

Borodowski was still listed as rabbi on the website for Congregation Sulam Yaakov in Larchmont.

The synagogue's president wrote a letter to the congregation saying members should help the rabbi 'recover from his illness and ... welcome him back as our spiritual leader at the appropriate time.'
