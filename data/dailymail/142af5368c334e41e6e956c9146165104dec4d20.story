This is the mortifying moment the Good Morning Britain studio descended into giggles after actor Dan Stevens took host Susanna Reid's interview question the wrong way. 

Stevens, a former star of the period drama Downton Abbey, was appearing on the ITV breakfast show to promote his  thriller film The Guest.

But he was left in a fit of laughter after Reid used some unfortunate phrasing to ask him if he had to fight off competition from American actors to land the lead role.

The presenter asked: 'You play this 
apparent all-America hero and this is a big opportunity for you in 
Hollywood. You must have had to beat off a lot of American men to get 
this part?'

Stevens immediately burst into giggles, while members of the studio could be heard laughing loudly in the background.

Seemingly oblivious, Reid then asked: 'Why does that make you giggle? Did you not have to beat them off?'

Her co-host Ben Shephard tried to salvage the interview, quickly adding: 'Actually, to get the role, I can imagine there were quite a few men up for the role as well?' 

As Stevens continued to laugh, Reid appeared to realise her blunder and told him: 'Compose yourself', while Shephard rubbed his eye and smiled.

Too amusing: But despite his efforts, he quickly burst into another fit of giggles. Reid's co-host Ben Shephard was left trying to salvage the interview, adding: 'I can imagine there were quite a few men up for the role?'

Response:  As Stevens continued to laugh, Reid appeared to realise her blunder and told him: 'Compose yourself'. Above, the presenter later took to Twitter, saying: 'That wasn't exactly what I meant...'

Later in the interview, Stevens spoke of him and film director Adam Wingard having a 'twisted sense of humour', to which Reid replied: 'Clearly!'

She then added: 'I'm a bit nervous asking you any more questions.' 

Stevens later took to Twitter to poke fun at Reid, dubbing the interview 'The Great British Beat Off.'
