The sudden death of Melbourne Cup favourite Admire Rakti has led to claims horses are being pushed too hard to race.

The Japanese-owned horse collapsed in his stall and died just moments after crossing the finishing line in last place on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, the results of an autopsy performed on Admire Rakti showed he had suffered from 'acute heart failure' after crossing the finish line in last place.

Earlier in the day, Sydney University veterinarian David Evans was asked on 2UE radio if he thought racehorses were being pushed too hard and he admitted they were expected to perform past their limits. 

'That's a value-based question. If you look at injury rates and bleeding in the lungs, you could argue that they are pushed beyond the extremes of what their body can withstand without injury,' he said. 

Dr Evans said racehorses go through 'massive changes' in their cardiovascular system when they were racing because they were going from a gentle life in a paddock to training at high speeds.

In a initial statement, Racing Victoria's chief veterinarian Brian Stewart said the horse had died from the rare 'sudden death syndrome', which occurs in just 0.007 per cent of racehorses.  

But there is debate over whether or not the syndrome actually exists.

Sydney University veterinarian David Evans told 2UE radio on Wednesday morning there was no such thing as the illness.

When asked by one of the hosts of the breakfast show about it, Dr Evans replied: 'Sudden death syndrome is just sudden death. It doesn't tell me what killed the horse.'

The second horse to die after the Melbourne Cup was Araldo.

His death happened after he got spooked by a large flag, kicked a fence and broke his leg in what has been called a 'freak accident'. Vets were later forced to euthanise him as the damage could not be repaired.

Dr Evans said depending on the severity of the break, a horse could not live comfortably on four legs because of its weight. 

He said the horse needed to have the functionality of all four legs for its own welfare. 

'The point is we have an animal of incredible weight, 500 kilos, standing on these finely built legs,' Dr Evans said.

'You have to put plates and screws in and plaster casts on and hope they can stand.'

Admire Rakti, which won the Caulfield Cup in brilliant style in October, raced near the lead for most of the 3,200-metre journey on Tuesday.

The Melbourne Cup is the nation's longest flat race where as the Caufield Cup is only 2,400 metres and the Cox Plate is even less at 2,040 metres long. 

Before the cup, some experts predicted that Admire Rakti would struggle to run the distance due to his heavy weight.

The analysts forecast that the stallion, at 58.5kg, would find carrying his weight at a fast pace over the long distance problematic.

No Cup runner weighing 58.5kg or more has won the race since 1975.  

Leading up to the race, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses plastered a graphic image of a horse laying down on its side asking race-goers 'Is the party really worth it?'

Associate Professor Chris Whitton - who heads the University of Melbourne's equine orthopaedic research - told Daily Mail Australia weight did not increase the risk of sudden death in horses.

'The increase of sudden death depends on the age of the horse, the length of the race and the number of races the horse had competed in in the two months,' he said.

'Certainly the longer the race, the greater the risk. We also know that the faster the horses are going the more stress it is putting on the horse.'

Associate Professor Whitton said research indicated that with every stride a horse took there was about four tonnes of load put on the joints.

'The reason is because of the mechanics of the limbs, horses store a lot of energy in their tendons,' he said.

'Any time those tendons are stretched...  extreme stress is put on the limbs and the heart – which beats at 230 beats per minute as soon as the horse starts galloping – so they're pushing their biology to the limit when they're going fast.' 

The deaths of the two horses have overshadowed the victory of German-trained Protectionist, who romped away with the biggest winning margin in nearly two decades, and also reignited a bitter debate about the ethical treatment of racing horses.

Leading up the race, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses plastered a graphic image of a horse laying down on its side on the CityLink road near Footscray Road in west Melbourne as part of their campaign, asking race-goers 'Is the party really worth it?' and also posted the same image on their Facebook page.

The group is now hitting out at the use of whips by jockeys, which it says is pushing racehorses beyond their physical limits.

'We believe that pushing horses beyond their physical limits through use of the whip, and racing horses while under-developed at two years of age are significant factors as to why horses break down on the racetrack,' spokesman Ward Young said.

'We're calling on the racing industry to start running whip-free races and phase out two year-old racing.'

Dr Evans said there was no research that showed there would be a lower injury rate if horses under two years old were not used. 

The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses claims 125 horses died on Australian racetracks between August 1 last year and July 31 this year.

'That is one horse being killed every 2.9 days,' Mr Young said.  

After hearing of the horses' deaths, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told Daily Mail Australia the incidents as 'very sad news' on Tuesday.

'But racing is a dangerous sport and the jockeys and trainers take all the care that they can and I know that they set very high standards her and terrible accidents do happen,' Ms Bishop said.

Donna Wallis, from Knorrit Flat, NSW went to see Admire Rakti before he raced at his pen in The Stables.

She said: 'He seemed fine - a bit excitable. It's a real shame - very sad. He was fine in the race. It seemed to be when they got him back to the stables.' 

Kathline Gontin, from Kensington, Melbourne, also went to see Admire Rakti before he raced.

She said: 'He was a beautiful horse - I put a bet on him. I saw him walking [in the stables circle] after he had finished.

'He seemed okay. Just a bit excited. I saw them putting a stick in his mouth - I don't know why.

'Then after I left I heard he had died. It is so sudden - and very sad.'

Before Admire Ratki rode in last, winner Protectionist was the first German horse to gallop to victory at Melbourne, heading Red Cadeaux and Who Shot Thebarman down the stretch of the 3,200-metre course.

The five-year-old stallion’s owners will pocket $3.6 million of the Melbourne Cup's generous $6.2 million pool.

'He's very easy, very good horse,' Jockey Ryan Moore told Channel Seven. 'I'm very pleased.'

'His record his very good and I'm very pleased with him.'

'(It was a) strong pace. He was able to sort of follow Mutual Regard. And, you know, he has thrown him in.

'Obviously, it's very special. You have to share it with the kids. Because being away a lot. I need to win these races to make it worthwhile.'

Two chances were scratched prior to the race - Cavalryman and Sea Moon - reducing the final field to 22 horses.

Punters heavily backed Irish horse Mutual Regard in the final hours before the race - while late public support also came for Who Shot Thebarman.

Trainer Andreas Wohler said the win was 'a moment you won't forget in your life'.

'We've had great success all over the world but this is the biggest of all,' he said.

'He was so patient and he came around the last bend. He just needed to have the right gap and he found it. He is a superstar. It's unbelievable.

'It's a moment you won't forget in your life. It's a big achievement for our team. Thanks for the honour'.
