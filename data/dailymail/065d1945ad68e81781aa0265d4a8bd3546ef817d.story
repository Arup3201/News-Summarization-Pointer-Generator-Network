Brazil's nail-biting World Cup win over Chile on Saturday night set records tumbling on Twitter.

The engrossing last-16 tie, which saw the hosts progress on penalties after a 1-1 draw, generated an unprecedented number of Tweets Per Minute (TPM) for a sporting event.

The peak of the 140-character soundbites came when Chile's Gonzalo Jara saw his penalty rebound back off the inside of the post, sending Brazil through 3-2 in the shoot-out.
