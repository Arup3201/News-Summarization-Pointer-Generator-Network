Tottenham Hotspur are the dirtiest team in the Barclays Premier League, according to Opta data, with QPR the fairest.

Opta measure discipline by attributing one point to each team for a foul, three for a yellow card and six for a red.

The team with the most points are therefore the side with the worst disciplinary record.

Fouls = 1 point. Yellow card = 3 points. Red card = 6 points.

As things stand, Spurs - who have had three players sent off this season - have the worst record and are closely followed by Crystal Palace and Manchester City in third.

Liverpool in 17th are the fourth-fairest team while Everton and Southampton are the second and third-fairest teams.

Despite their players picking up three red cards this season, Manchester United only have the eighth-worst disciplinary record.

Opta's stats also reveal the players who are responsible for the most disciplinary points at each club.

Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak with 46 has more than any other player in the Premier League, while QPR's dirtiest player Leroy Fer has just 22 points.

Perhaps surprisingly, Spurs winger Erik Lamela is their dirtiest player having accrued 32 points.
