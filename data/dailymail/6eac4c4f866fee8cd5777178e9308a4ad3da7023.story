Weathering the storm? Sir Philip Green met Arcadia Group's 40% profit slump with 250 store closures

Sir Philip Green, the owner of Arcadia Group, has responded to a 40 per cent drop on the company's profits by announcing the closure of 250 stores.

Arcadia, which owns Miss Selfridge, BHS, Burton and Evans as well as Top Shop, reported underlying pre-tax profits of £133.1million compared with £213.1million last year, as like-for-like sales including VAT fell 1.8 per cent.

Sir Philip blamed the weather in part, saying that the unseasonably warm autumn had dented sales of winter clothing and suggested that as the chain tries to cut spending it could end up closing around 250 shops.

The company, which currently has 
2,507 stores across its brands, saw margins squeezed by 1.8 per cent as 
it took a £53million hit to avoid passing its higher spending on to 
customers.

He told the BBC that 'extremely 
challenging' conditions would force the chain to shut around half of its
stores which have a lease expiring in the next three years, saying: 'I 
would expect us to close 250, 260.'

He added: 'Additionally, the warmest October and November on record have made autumn trading much tougher.'

Although the winter collections were 
released more than a month ago, temperatures in may parts of the UK have
barely dropped in to single figures.

The results came on the day the 
Office of National Statistics confirmed that the UK's GDP rose by just 
0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2011.

Dixons Retail, owner of Currys and PC World, also fared poorly as it revealed losses of £25.3million between April and October.

Network Rail's net debt has risen to £25.74billion, the rail infrastructure company announced today.

The figure - for the 12 months ending March 31 - is an increase on the £25.05billion figure for the previous 12 months.

But NR, which has no shareholders and is a not-for-dividend company, said its net debt remained 'at an expected level'.

The figure was released alongside NR's results for April-September 2011, which showed that it made a £136million profit in that period - only half of its gains last year.

In autumn 2008 NR was set the challenge by the Office of Rail Regulation of cutting costs by 22 per cent between 2009 and 2014.

The company said today that by the end of last year an estimated 13 per cent had been saved and in the last half-year efficiencies had contributed to further savings of more than £300million.

However, its performance in the UK is
an improvement on last year, with a loss of £3.9million compared with 
£10.7million in the same period of 2010.

The figure includes a one-off hit of 
£4million from the losses sustained in the August riots, when the 
expensive goods in the company's shops proved a particular target for 
many looters.

Like-for-like sales were down eight 
per cent, but this was better than expected as sales of both white goods
and tablet computers held up well.

Dixons' losses came as its 
international markets, which include the debt-laden economies of Greece 
and Italy, dragged on overall performance.

The company's shares have lost 
two-thirds of their value over the past two years after it shocked 
markets with a series of profits warnings.

Arcadia's programme of closures will 
follow the likes of Mothercare, HMV and Thorntons, which have all shut 
stores amid the economic gloom.

Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG
Index, said: 'Store group Arcadia reminds everyone that the British 
consumer is still generally AWOL, with no likelihood of a quick return.'

But Arcadia said it would continue to invest in its brands, after investment of £113million in the year to August.
