Wanted: Michael Bennison, 28, who is suspected of stabbing his 27-year-old girlfriend with a bladed item in York on Friday afternoon

A man has been arrested after it is believed he tried to kill his girlfriend while on the run from police.

Michael Bennison, 28, was arrested in York yesterday evening following a nationwide manhunt.

Bennison, who was homeless, had spent two weeks on the run over a separate alleged assault and drug dealing.

However on Friday he is believed to have attacked his 27-year-old girlfriend, allegedly stabbing her and puncturing one of her lungs in a cul-de-sac in Huntington, York.

She was taken to York District Hospital to be treated for her injuries and doctors say she is in a stable condition after being treated for multiple wounds.

Following the alleged stabbing, a nationwide police manhunt was launched for Bennison after it was feared he had left the city.

However, he remained in York and was arrested at a house near to where the woman was attacked on suspicion of attempted murder, possession of drugs with intent to supply and assault.

Detective Inspector Shaun Page, of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'I would like to convey my thanks to the media and the many members of the public who have contributed to the search and helped us to locate Bennison.'

Bennison had escaped jail in October 2010 after an assault on a woman left her scarred for life. He was sentenced to an 11-month suspended sentence.

He was jailed for fourteen months in June last year however after attacking a second woman.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said that the arrest was the result of a mix of police work and public intelligence.

Stabbing: The 27-year-old woman was stabbed in the Huntington area of York on Friday

Wounded: The 27-year-old woman was taken to York District Hospital with injuries including a punctured lung, where she remains in a stable condition
