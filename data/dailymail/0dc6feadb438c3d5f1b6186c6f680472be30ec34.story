Martina Hingis admitted to having dreamt about her Wimbledon comeback during the seven years since she last played here, but she probably envisaged it lasting a little longer than 64 minutes.

That is how long it took Sania Mirza and Cara Black to sweep away the Swiss legend and her doubles partner Vera Zvonareva. Hingis, who lost in the third round of the singles in 2007, was once box office gold at the All England Club.

She won the title at 16 — one of five Grand Slam singles crowns — and captivated with her wily tennis and youthful charm. How times change.

Not how she left it: Martina Hingis lost a doubles match in straight sets at Wimbledon on Wednesday

Back in the day: Hingis won Wimbledon as a teenager back in 1997

After losing 6-2, 6-4 in front of a couple of hundred spectators on the relative wilderness of Court 19, Hingis shuffled off the court, flashing a weak smile to autograph hunters. It is easy to forget that at 33, Hingis is three months younger than Venus Williams, who is still alive in the singles and doubles at SW19.

Hingis is still enthusiastic about tennis, offering her services as a TV pundit and was courtside as Zvonareva beat Briton Tara Moore in the singles.

There were glimpses of that renowned tennis brain as she saved break point at the start of the second set but ultimately it was far from a dream return.
