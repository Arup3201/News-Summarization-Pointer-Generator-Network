Too busy to boil an egg?  No need to worry, because one supermarket is about to sell ready-to-eat, hard-boiled eggs.

For carbohydrate-avoiders in a hurry, they might be the perfect answer, but if you're sitting next to someone on a bus who gets one out, you may not be so sure.

This week Waitrose will start selling individual, hard-boiled and peeled eggs at 69p each.

Hitting the supermarkets this week: Individually-wrapped, ready-peeled hard-boiled eggs will cost 69p each

Given that a dozen free range eggs at the supermarket cost £2.92, or 24.5p each, you are paying more than double for the convenience of someone else having boiled it and peeled it for you.

But producers The Original Egg Company, who say are sure their  low-carb, low-fat, and high protein eggs Snack Eggs will be a hit.

And they reckon they've already tackled the nasty sulphur smell that often accompanies hard-boiled eggs, by packaging them with an absorbency patch to soak it up.

Original Egg Company managing director Maria Paice told MailOnline: 'The convenience food market is a huge growth area right now, and we think this will appeal to all sorts of people.

'Our research shows that men who go to the gym like to snack on eggs, as well as people on low carbohydrate diets, and they will also be good for picnics and children's packed lunches.'

The eggs will have a shelf-life of up to eight days, similar to egg mayonnaise in sandwiches.

Waitrose buyer Shaun Birrell said the eggs contained just 60 calories each 
and were a 'brilliant healthy snack'.

He said: 'The food-to-go market is a 
destination shop for many customers to Waitrose and being able to offer 
this unique, single ready-to-eat snacking egg is very exciting.'

Ready-boiled eggs have been tried before - in 2009 the Happy Egg Company launched a two-pack of them for 89p, but the product was criticised for its smell and excess water in the packaging.

But Ms Paice reckons that by selling them individually and with the odour absorbency patch, her company has cracked it this time.
