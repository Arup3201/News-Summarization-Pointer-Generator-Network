The young Margaret Roberts manoeuvred her way out of a fledgling relationship by setting her amorous admirer up with her older sister.

She also danced through Oxford with another suitor as a young student. These are just some of the astonishing stories to emerge in a new authorised biography of Baroness Thatcher.

A new biography by Charles Moore, former editor of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph, reveals details of two relationships the future Prime Minister had before Denis - to which she never previously admitted.

The biography draws on a cache of some 150 intimate and revealing letters written by Margaret to her sister Muriel.

Growing up in Grantham, Margaret apparently had no boyfriends, and her first relationship began after she went to Somerville College, Oxford to read chemistry in October 1943.

Tony Bray was an undergraduate at Brasenose College whom she met through the Oxford University Conservative Assocation in the autumn of 1944. They were both 18, and she was slightly older than him, Moore records in Margaret Thatcher, The Authorised Biography Volume One: Not For Turning.

Tony was a public-school-educated Army cadet who was pursuing a special six-month course devised to combine military training with lectures on the 'general sciences'. Tony found Margaret thoughtful, serious, with a degree of loneliness, but nonetheless a good conversationalist. He said he was impressed with her unusual enthusiasm for politics.

He was also taken with her appearance and dress sense, describing her as plump and well-built but never-the-less attractive.

Tony Bray realised that Margaret Roberts was serious about pursuing her political career, which would take her to mount an unsuccessful campaign in Dartford for its safe Labour seat 

Conforming to the mores of the day the pair did not go around as an item, but would have tea in one another’s rooms, where Tony was impressed with her cooking of crumpets. Tony said that it was his impression from the way that Margaret kissed that she had had no boyfriend before, but she showed a delight in physical intimacy. However they never slept together.

At the 21st birthday party of a Grantham schoolfriend in December 1944 she arrived carrying a carnation. She told her friends a man had given her the flower, but never revealed his name - Tony Bray. It was at that party that she also confided in her friends that she wanted to become a Member of Parliament.

In March 1945, back in Grantham for the Easter vacation, Margaret wrote to her sister with details of every dance she had been to and her letter adopted a noticeably more animated tone than previous rather matter-of-fact ones. The approach of victory meant suddenly, after years of war, college balls could go ahead again. Margaret went to five dances that month.  

One in particular stood out for her - the Randolph Ball at the Randolph Hotel, for which Tony hired a car and took her for a meal at the Crown and Thistle pub in Abingdon first. She borrowed a royal blue velvet cloak for the occasion which matched a blue dress she had.

Defeated - this time: the future Prime Minister congratulates Norman Dodds, Labour MP for Dartford, on his win. The new biography shows her to have been dismayed when women talked only about domestic matters and did not share her passion for politics

Tony presented her with eight carnations 'sent for me from London so with the front part of my hair piled up on top Jean and Mary [Oxford friends] said I looked simply smashing. I felt absolutely on top of the world as we walked through the lounge at the Crown and Thistle and everyone looked up and stared.'

After the long years of wartime deprivation she described, in detail, what they ate and drank: gin and grapefruit, then a thick creamy soup followed by pigeon and a chocolate sweet, served with Moussec. She then informed her sister, in case she didn't know, that Moussec was a sparkling champagne.

They reached the elaborately decked out Randolph at a quarter to nine, by which time the dancefloor was already packed. The Duchess of Marlborough arrived soon after they did. She enjoyed the refreshments and she concluded it was the best and biggest ball she had ever been to.

Asked about it 60 years later Tony remembered buying the carnations and, when reminded of Margaret’s blue dress, broke down in tears, saying the evening had been very special.

It was decided that Tony should meet her parents, so preparations began for him to come to their home above the shop in Grantham - a significant step. In old age he recounted that he and Margaret never discussed the question of marriage, and he had reservations about doing so because then a man could still be sued for breaking off an engagement.

Tony, who had noticed the strain of financing Margaret's time at university, found the Roberts shop a modest business establishment. He found her parents very proper.

By now Tony's six-month course at Oxford was over and he was sent to Bovington Camp in Dorset and various other military establishments until being posted to Germany in 1946. His letters to her became less and less frequent, to the point where Margaret wrote to his mother, whom she had

never met, to ask what had happened to him.

Margaret’s sister Muriel simply believed Tony believed was snobbish and looked down on Margaret's family. Tony, disagreed - he said his concerns about her background centred on its seriousness.

Moore commented in an interview that although the book was written at Lady Thatcher's invitation, she could nonetheless be 'evasive', particularly when it came to her private life. So she told him she had had no boyfriends before Denis. And when asked specifically about Tony, she acknowledged the details but would not add any detail.

They met again and had a few more dates in 1949 but he realised she was determined to embark on her political career and the relationship fizzled out. Tony, a widower, lives in a nursing home.

Meanwhile by 1949 Margaret met two other men who would shape her - and her sister's - future. 

At a dinner after a meeting to introduce her as the parliamentary candidate for Dartford, a safe Labour seat, she met a prominent local businessman: 'a Major Thatcher, who has a flat in London (age about 36, plenty of money)...not a very attractive creature – very reserved but quite nice'.

But he was not the only man to show an interest in her. At a Colchester Conservative party earlier that month, she met an Essex farmer of Scottish origin, William Cullen, who was determined to ask her out.

She described him in a letter to her sister as quite ardent while driving her home.  and she confided 'I’m afraid he’s going to be an awful nuisance.' She didn't get on with his Scottish accent but was interested to see the family farm.

Curiously, it appears that she, sensing that he was keener on her than vice versa, wanted to introduce him to her sister Muriel. She wrote to her: 'Went to the flicks yesterday with my farmer friend and got him all primed up to meet you sometime. I showed him the snapshot of you and I [sic] together – and he said he could scarcely tell the difference so I should think we could easily substitute me for you. When can you come down for a weekend?'

But Willie continued to pursue Margaret, giving her expensive Crêpe de Chine scent and visiting her every other day when she was ill. One gift survives: a blackcalf handbag. 

Change of heart: Margaret's sister Muriel married William Cullen - the farmer who had originally pursued her

She wrote to Muriel that it had cost £7-3s - which she felt was not too expensive - which her conscience wouldn’t have allowed - but enough of a gift for her to add: 'I’ll have to hang on with William for a while longer now!'

She 'hung on with William' for long enough to meet his family, though she was dismayed that the wives only talked of domestic matters, so after the dinner she remained with the men. 

Margaret carried on arranging meetings between Willie and Muriel, and after a few months he and Margaret talked things through on the phone. A few months later, Willie and Muriel announced their engagement. They married in April 1950 and Margaret was their only bridesmaid.

During her time at Oxford, she wrote many letters to her sister Muriel in which she frequently complained of the difficulty of affording clothes. In one letter she expressed frustration that her weight was not dipping below about 10st 4lbs. She asked her sister for tips on how to reduce 'the area of the seat and control of the tummy muscles – oh and also reduction and uplift of bust'.

Earlier, while a sixth-former at Kesteven and Grantham Girls School, one her scientific experiments almost ended up gassing her fellow-pupils. Lorna Smith, one of her contemporaries, recalled how ink had been spilt on the classroom parquet floor.

Margaret decided that the rapidly increasing black stain should be tackled with bleaching-powder and have hydrochloric acid - that had been stolen from the lab - poured on it. Lorna scrubbed away furiously, and the boards began to recover, but suddenly she was almost overcome by the fumes and had to rush out doors.

Margaret had inadvertently created chlorine gas. The teachers heard the girls' violent coughing but were too worried about them to be angry. Lorna believed her lungs had not been the same since.
