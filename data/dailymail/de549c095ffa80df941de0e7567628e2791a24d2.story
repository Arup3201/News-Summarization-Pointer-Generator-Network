Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen believes Mauricio Pochettino is beginning to get to grips with his job at White Hart Lane after an inconsistent start to his reign.

The 42-year-old, who left Southampton over the summer to take charge of the north London club, has experienced mixed results since moving to the capital.

After suffering home defeats to Liverpool and West Brom, Spurs have battled back with a creditable draw against local rivals Arsenal and a 1-0 win against Pochettino's former club.

Vertonghen is pleased with the improvement shown by his side in recent matches after a difficult spell saw them fail to win in four games.

Speaking to Belgium newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, Vertonghen said: 'Sportingly, the beginning of the season was volatile. A good start was followed by a decline and now it’s running a little better.'

Despite Spurs' upturn in form the former Ajax star has confirmed that he will not be signing a new contract with the club.

He added: 'I can only say that the decision was taken in consultation with the club.'
