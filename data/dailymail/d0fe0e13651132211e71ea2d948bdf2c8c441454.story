The man who led Netherlands to the World Cup final four years ago has questioned why Louis van Gaal has changed the team’s formation so close to the tournament starting in Brazil.

Bert van Marwijk said the decision to go from 4-3-3 to 5-3-2 left players little time to adapt to a ‘significant transition’ with their opening group game against Spain less than a fortnight away.

Van Gaal, who takes over at Manchester United once the World Cup is over, implemented the new system, which relies on energetic wing-backs, in Holland’s 1-0 friendly victory over Ghana last Saturday and will continue with it for the match against Wales tonight at the Amsterdam Arena.

The change was made to tighten up the Dutch defence and has so far been seen as a success but Van Marwijk cautioned against such a large shift away from the style that brought him success in 2010.

‘It is his right to opt for a 5-3-2 system, but this is not my system,’ Van Marwijk told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. ‘This is not just an adaptation, but a significant transition, which calls for a lot from players .

‘As a coach I indicated as soon as possible how I wanted to play and then worked for two years. The players would grow accustomed. That needs to be faster.’

Van Gaal has already given short shrift to doubts from others over his selection, which has Daley Blind of Ajax and Daryl Janmaat of Feyenoord in the wing-back positions and Wesley Sneijder operating behind Robin Van Persie and Arjen Robben in attack. And he is unlikely to care too much about Van Marwijk’s observations.

More relevant to the incoming United boss is where Holland finish and the ‘large expectations’ of the Dutch federation. It is something he will undoubtedly have at Old Trafford too.

Setting targets: The purpose is to win the World Cup, insists next Manchester United manager Van Gaal

‘The purpose is to win the World Cup – but that's only for one,’ said Van Gaal. ‘The purpose of the board is the semi-finals. That is maybe too big an expectation.

‘I think this team can beat all. But we can also lose. That’s sport and we accept that but it’s difficult for the Dutch people to accept.

‘I give myself more pressure than anyone else. I will always win.’
