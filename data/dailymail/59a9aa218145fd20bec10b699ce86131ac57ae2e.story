Downing Street was under mounting pressure last night to ease the 40p tax burden on the middle classes.

The Chancellor is expected to reject calls for a significant increase to the threshold in next week’s Budget, after figures showed millions more are being sucked into the higher rate tax.

The Government argues that it has cut taxes for all workers by repeatedly increasing the amount they can earn before paying any income tax at all, which will reach £10,000 next month.

Reject: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is likely to refuse to listen to calls ahead of next week's Budget to ease the burden on middle-class taxpayers

But they are facing growing demands to help the 1.4million workers who have been sucked into the 40p band since 2010, with MPs arguing many of these people are on middling incomes.

Official figures show that the top 25 per cent of earners – anyone on £33,717 or more – will pay 75 per cent of the country’s total £167billion of income tax this year.

By contrast, the bottom half will pay less than 10 per cent.

When the Coalition came to power in May 2010 the starting salary for higher rate tax stood at just £43,875.

If George Osborne had allowed the 40p tax band to rise in line with inflation it would now not kick in until a worker reached a salary of £50,000, according to calculations by accountants Grant Thornton.

But since 2010 Mr Osborne has repeatedly frozen or lowered this threshold – meaning hundreds of thousands have been dragged in.

As a result, some 4.4million people now pay the 40p rate, up from just 3.02million when the Coalition came to power and 1.35million in 1988. Ministers insist that everyone earning up to £100,000 has benefited from the increases in the basic threshold – though admit that higher rate taxpayers have seen much less significant benefits.

Downing Street last night warned Tory MPs agitating for a hike in the 40p threshold that they risk undermining the credit the party should be getting from voters for the new basic threshold. ‘If we as Tories go on and on about the higher rate versus the personal allowance, we’re obscuring a massive tax cut we have given every person who earns under £100,000,’ said one source.

But Dominic Raab, the Conservative MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘The 40p rate was designed to tax the rich, but now clobbers the middle classes. Yes, take the poor out of tax – but do it by cutting government spending, not at the expense of aspirational Britain.’

His views were echoed by Jonathan Todd, the chief economist at centre-left think tank Demos, who said: ‘People are being taxed too much on income but not enough on property. This is especially true in London, where a £41,000 salary doesn’t make you rich but does take you into the higher income tax bracket. The tax system should be updated to reflect how incomes have grown since 1988.’

David Cameron, speaking on a trip to Israel, insisted higher rate taxpayers earning up to £100,000 had also benefited from the increases in the basic-rate threshold.

‘What I am determined to do is to go on delivering tax cuts for low and middle income earners and from April this year there will be £10,000 you can earn before you start paying tax and that has been benefiting everybody earning up to £100,000,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘That’s a significant tax cut, a huge change. The point is people on the upper rate have benefited from the £10,000 tax-free income.’ 

Tory MP for Hereford Jesse Norman said: ‘The Chancellor’s made clear he believes the most effective way to support low and middle income earners is to enable them to keep more of the money they earn.

‘This is why he has increased the personal allowance. These increases are aimed at the less well-off, but higher-rate taxpayers have also benefited. Indeed, they are better off than if the higher rate threshold had increased with inflation.’ 

Official figures show that in 2013-14, the 25 per cent highest earners will pay 75 per cent of all income tax, while the top ten per cent, on £47,913 or more, will account for 59 per cent. The top 1 per cent will pay 28.3 per cent, or £47billion.

The Treasury said that thanks to the £10,000 allowance, in 2013-14, higher rate taxpayers are about £45 better off than if tax thresholds had grown in line with inflation.
