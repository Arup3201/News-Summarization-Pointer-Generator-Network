An Egyptian court has condemned the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 682 of his supporters to death, a year after the Islamist group was ousted from power in a military coup.

Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's general guide, and his fellow defendants faced charges over an attack on a police station in Minya in 2013 in which a policeman was killed.

If confirmed by Egypt's Grand Mufti, it would make him the most senior Brotherhood figure sentenced to death 
since one of the group's leading ideologues, Sayed Qutb, was sentenced 
and executed in 1966.

The decision sparked hysteria outside the court as several women fainted upon hearing news of the verdicts, while others wailed: 'Why? This is unfair!'

But after sentencing Badie and his followers, the judge then overturned the death penalties of another 492 Muslim Brotherhood members, jailing them for life instead.

Grief: The decision sparked hysteria outside the court as several relatives fainted upon hearing news of the verdicts

Overcome: Egyptian women overcome by emotion fall to the ground after a judge sentenced to death more than 680 alleged supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood

Appeal: Death sentence recommendations in the case involving Badie will now be passed on to Egypt's Mufti, the highest religious authority. His opinion, however, is not legally binding and can be ignored by the court

They were among 529 men sentenced to death in March in one of a series of mass trials that have been widely
 condemned by human rights campaigners in and out of the country. The 
other 37 convicts from those proceedings were told they would remain on 
death row.

In 
announcing the 683 death sentences for violence and the killing of 
policemen, Judge Said Youssef also said he was referring his 
ruling to the Grand Mufti, the nation's top Islamic official - a 
requirement under Egyptian law, but one that is considered a formality. 
It does, however, give a window of opportunity for a judge to reverse an
 initial sentence.

Both
 Monday's and the March trial are linked to deadly riots that erupted in
 Minya and elsewhere in Egypt after security forces violently disbanded 
sit-ins held by Brotherhood supporters in Cairo last August. Three 
policemen and a civilian were killed in those riots.

Hundreds
 were killed as part of a sweeping campaign against supporters of former
 President Mohammed Morsi, ousted by the military last July. The removal
 of Morsi - a year after he was elected - came after millions 
demonstrated against his rule, demanding he step down for abuse of 
power. 

Egypt's interim, military-backed government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist group, a claim it denies.

Some 16,000 people have been arrested since the military ousted Morsi last July, including most of the group's top leaders. Large numbers of pro-Morsi protesters have also been rounded up and detained by police.  

Fear: The biggest trials in Egypt's modern history have reinforced fears among human rights groups that the military-backed government and anti-Islamist judges are bent on crushing dissent

Anger: There were hundreds of supporters of the defendants outside court who reacted angrily at news of their family-members' fate

After Monday's 
ruling, which followed a single session in the case held last month, 
Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Human Rights Watch's 
Middle East and North Africa Division, said the defendants were not 
given the chance to properly defend themselves. The proceedings went on 
without the judge even verifying that the defendants were present, she 
said.

'The fact that the death sentences can
 be appealed provides little solace to hundreds of families that will go
 to sleep tonight facing the very real prospect that their loves ones 
could be executed without having an opportunity to present a case in 
court,' she said. 'There is no more serious violation of the most basic 
right of due process and the right to a fair trial than that.'

According to a judicial official who 
oversaw the investigation in the case, evidence presented in the trial 
consisted mostly of footage of the defendants showing them attacking and
 looting a police station in Cairo and setting fire to several 
government buildings. The defendants faced nearly 14 charges, five of 
them punishable by death, said the official.

'This
 is a public opinion case, there must be a swift, deterrent punishment,'
 said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was 
not authorized to talk to the media. 'Yes, the verdict is very harsh, 
the number of people on trial is shocking, but it's proportional to the 
crimes.'

Badie
 was not at the hearing in Minya but in another court, in 
Cairo, where he faces charges of murder and incitement to murder along 
with 16 other Brotherhood leaders in a case connected to deadly protests
 outside the group's headquarters last June.

Pain: A woman weeps after learning that her relative will be put to death

On guard: Egyptian policemen stand guard outside the court. Once the Mufti reviews Monday's ruling, the same court will hold another session on June 21 to issue the final verdicts

Wives, sisters, mothers and children of the 683 men sentenced to death cried, shouted and collapsed into each other's arms

Once the Mufti reviews Monday's ruling, the same court will hold another session on June 21 to issue the final verdicts.

As
 the ruling was announced, an outcry erupted outside the court among the
 families and relatives of the defendants.

'My three sons are inside,' 
said a woman who only gave her first name, Samiya, as she screamed in 
grief. 'I have no one but God.'

Sitting
 on the pavement in front of the police cordon, 58-year-old Fatma, who 
also would not give her second name fearing for her relative on trial, 
broke into tears and screamed: 'This judge is a butcher.'

The father of another defendant, Mohammed Hassan Shehata, said his son Mahmoud was arrested in January, six months after the alleged violence he was charged with.

'There is no evidence whatsoever,' he said. 'If my son is guilty, behead him but if he is innocent, there will be a civil war.'

Another woman who also only gave her first name, Safiya, 48, could not believe her brother and son were sentenced to death. 'I swear, they don't even pray, they don't go to mosques,' she said. 'They are not Muslim Brotherhood.'

Condemned to death: Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's general guide, and his fellow 682 defendants faced charges over an attack on a police station in Minya in 2013 in which a policeman was killed

Pleading: A relative pleads with police upon hearing of the verdicts outside court

Rising tensions: Today's decisions are certain to raise tension in Egypt, which has been gripped by turmoil since the army removed the Brotherhood from power last year

Ousted: Authorities have cracked down punishingly on Islamists since President Mohammed Morsi, who belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood, was ousted in a military coup last July. Hundreds have been killed and thousands arrested

Lawyer Ali Kamal, said Monday's 
hearing lasted only eight minutes. Security forces surrounded the court 
building and blocked roads, preventing families and media from attending
 the proceedings. 'This is against the spirit of the law,' Kamal said.

But
 in the capital, Cairo, where many are strongly anti-Brotherhood, 
several residents said they approved of the death sentences.

'Even
 if they sentence a million people to death, so what?' said Sadeek 
el-Moghazi, a 43-year-old newspaper seller in the eastern district of 
Heliopolis. 'This is the best ruling in the history of the Egyptian 
judiciary.'

Today's 
decisions are certain to raise tension in Egypt, which has been gripped 
by turmoil since the army removed the Brotherhood from power last year.

Authorities have cracked down punishingly on Islamists since President 
Mohammed Morsi, who belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood, was ousted in a military coup last July. Hundreds have been killed and thousands arrested.

The biggest trials in Egypt's modern history have reinforced fears among human rights groups that the military-backed government and anti-Islamist judges are bent on crushing dissent.

The authorities have branded the Brotherhood a terrorist group, an allegation it denies.
