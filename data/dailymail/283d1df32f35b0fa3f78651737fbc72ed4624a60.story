It is a part of a holiday that many people dread – the moment when they have to extricate themselves from the car-hire kiosk without signing away their lives (and their credit card details) to a raft of extra charges and financial add-ons.

That, at least, is the picture that has emerged of British travellers’ attitudes to renting a vehicle while away on an exotic escape.

According to a new survey, almost a third of tourists (31 per cent) feel pressurised during their transactions with car-hire companies, and feel that they are being deliberately scared into buying excess waiver insurance by unscrupulous representatives.

Rip-off: Almost one-in-two holidaymakers think car-hire excess insurance polices are too high

And almost one in four people – 24 per cent – feel that they have been rail-roaded into purchasing costly additional policies at the car-hire desk.

The research was conducted by YouGov on behalf of iCarhireinsurance.com.

It uncovered widespread nervousness about excess insurance – the add-on policies that protect consumers against high charges if a car is lost, damaged or stolen.

Far from reality: Many holidaymakers feel the car-hire experience does not match this dream image

The amount in question varies from transaction to transaction, but can easily be up to £1,500, depending on the make of vehicle.

Excess sums can be stored on customers’ credit cards if they decide against taking out excess waiver policies – another cause of concern for holidaymakers.

Figures 
show that excess deposits in Europe have gone up by 22 per cent in the 
last year – while the price of excess waivers has increased by some 26 
per cent.

Almost half of those surveyed – 45 per cent – said that they think the cost of excess policies is ‘a rip-off’.

Under pressure: Almost a third of British tourists feel they have been pressurised into buying car-hire extras

And almost two thirds – 62 per cent – said they were unaware that they could buy excess waiver policies from providers other than the hire company they are dealing with.

‘It’s a scandal that sky-high deposits are being used as a stick to beat with when people are trying to budget for a break,’ says Ernesto Suarez of iCarhireinsurance.com.
