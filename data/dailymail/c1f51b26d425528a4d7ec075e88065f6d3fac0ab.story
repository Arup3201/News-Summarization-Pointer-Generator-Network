A Sydney man told of how he heard an 'almighty bang' and saw a Range Rover 'still moving and sliding' across the road and passersby scrambling to help Jodhi Meares on Saturday night after she overturned her car.

Craig Russell, who lives on O'Sullivan Road, said James Packer's ex-wife and fashion designer Jodhi Meares, 43, ended up trapped in her car which had flipped onto the driver's side after an accident at 9.45pm on Saturday night.

At about 5.20pm on Monday, Rose Bay police arrived at Ms Meares' Point Piper apartment to make 'further enquiries' regarding last Saturday night's crash. The police buzzed Ms Meares' apartment twice before being allowed into the building after one police officer said: 'I have got some paperwork to drop off.'

The two officers emerged after spending around five minutes inside the apartment and then emerged.

Meanwhile, another witness, David Berger, has come forward saying the car Ms Meares wrote off belongs to a staffer on duty at the Jimmy Brings and Suppertine alcohol and food delivery business, outside where the crash occurred. He said Ms Meares was a client of the food delivery but not the alcohol service.

Mr Russell told MailOnline he heard an 'almighty bang' at and looked out his window to see a Range Rover 'still moving and sliding across the road with the driver in it, its lights on and flipped two feet off the ground onto the right hand driver's side'.

He said he watched the car slide across the road with Ms Meares still behind the wheel until it was pointing back in the direction from which it came.

The impact of the crash was so great it took off one of the Range Rover's wheels, he said.

While Mr Berger added that the female car owner would be making an insurance claim.

'It was written off,' Mr Berger told MailOnline,'It was a Ford Focus. It was parked out the front.'

When a passersby realised she was still trapped in the car, they tried to help Ms Meares out through the boot, and then when that did not work, tried to free her through the passenger door.

Ms Meares emerged 'very badly shaken', Mr Russell said, and she sat on the side of the road as police and then an ambulance arrived.

He said he believed the driver had been coming up Old South Head road and had turned right into O'Sullivan Road when it hit the first parked car, pushing it up onto the footpath, then hit the second car which jack knifed and shunted into the third car.

Mr Russell told MailOnline the driver was wearing a sweater, black tights and sandals and did not look as if she was dressed up for going out.

'I didn't recognise her,' he said.

'I didn't have a clue who she was, just a very badly shaken driver. Lucky she wasn't hurt.'

Mr Russell said the impact of the crash was so great it took off one of the Range Rover's wheels from Ms Meares' car in the accident

Neighbours Michael and Jane told MailOnline they saw Ms Meares lying on the grass verge of the footpath after the accident.

'Then she got up.. and the police [allegedly] said, "No you can't go, you're under arrest",' Michael said.

When police arrived at the scene they found a car overturned on its side and three other parked cars damaged.

Police would not confirm the woman's identity but released a statement confirming that a 43-year-old female was arrested at the scene of the accident and recorded a high-range blood-alcohol level - more than three times the legal limit.

There were no passengers in her car or in the three parked cars that she hit before her car rolled.

The woman was not injured but her car, along with two others, needed to be towed from the scene. Ms Meares' Range Rover has been impounded at a police towing yard in inner-western Sydney.

Police said a roadside breath test returned a reading of 0.181, which is three times over the limit.

The woman was charged with drink-driving and driving with a suspended licence.

She will face Waverley Local Court on August 5.

The maximum penalty for high-range drink driving is a $3,300 fine and an 18-month jail sentence.

An aide for Jon Stevens, Ms Meare's fiance, told Channel Nine this morning: 'She made a mistake, she made an error of judgment. There's no more comment.'

Ms Meares has been laying low since the incident on Saturday, but on Monday she took the time to share a cryptic message with her Twitter followers.

'His very first Instagram: Baby makes his appearance early, because he couldn't wait to meet...' she wrote.

The tweet ends with a link to an Instagram photo, but the image has since been removed leaving what was on the other side as a mystery.

This cryptic message shared on Twitter which doesn't link to any image, is Ms Meares' first post on social media since the alleged accident

In 1999 Jodhi married James Packer, the son of Australian media mogul Kerry Packer.

The marriage lasted three years, until 2002, before ending in divorce.

Now splitting her time between New York, Hawaii and Sydney, the former model is a yoga devotee.

She is engaged to the former Noiseworks frontman Jon Stevens after he proposed to her in Hawaii in July 2013.

He now performs with new band Dead Daisies while Jodhi, who sold her Tigerlily swimwear label to Billabong in 2007, now runs a yoga workout wear business.

Born and raised on NSW'S Sapphire Coast before moving to Sydney and becoming interested in aÂ  modelling career at age 14, the brunette found fame as a Moove milk model at 16.

She went on to host Australia's Next Top Model but famously failed to show at the season finale in 2008 after being paralysed by severe stage fright.
