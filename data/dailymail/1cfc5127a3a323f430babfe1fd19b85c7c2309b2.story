Step too far: Jonathan Charles Stevens, 24, was arrested for impersonating a police officer on Sunday after he pulled over a real cop in Tampa, Florida

A Florida man pretending to be a police officer pushed his luck way too far on Sunday when he pulled over a real cop - and got arrested for his troubles.

Incredibly, this is the second time in three months that 24-year-old Jonathan Charles Stevens, of Palmetto, has been charged with impersonating an officer.

According to Tampa Police, Stevens was driving a white Chevy Tahoe equipped with flashing red and blue emergency lights.

He then reportedly used the lights to stop a female officer at around 10.30pm at 17th Street North and 7th Avenue East in Ybor City.

Stevens told the policewoman that he wanted to report a reckless driver. Officers say that he had also called police dispatch to tell them about the same complaint.

Stevens reportedly told the officer that he worked for Homeland Security, and he had a Glock .45-caliber handgun and a badge around his neck.

But, according to the police report, the policewoman grew suspicious of the phony agent.

She continued to talk to Stevens and discovered that his vehicle was not registered to any government agency.

After further questioning, the man admitted that he wasn't a law enforcement officer. He also didn't have a concealed weapon permit.
