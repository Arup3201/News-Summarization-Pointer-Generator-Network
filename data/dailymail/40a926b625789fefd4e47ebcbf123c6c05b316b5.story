Looking for some serious Halloween inspiration? Look no further than Maria Malone-Guerbaa, a talented make-up artist who has recreated some of the most terrifying Halloween film characters on her own face.

The mother-of-two shot to fame earlier this year for her incredible ability to transform herself into almost any celebrity face using purely make-up.

After putting her passion on hold when she had her family, 40-year-old Maria began to post her famous faces online, and it wasn't long before her Instagram went viral.

Skills: Make-up artist Maria Malone-Guerbaa has recreated some of the most terrifying Halloween film characters on her own face

The Irish make-up artist who lives in London transformed herself into Freddy Krueger from Nightmare on Elm Street, Chucky and the terrifying masked killer Michael Myers from the film Halloween.

What makes her face painting technique so unusual, is that unlike other special effects make-up artists, she does not rely on any prosthetic materials to create her 'faces'.

Guess who? Maria transformed herself to resemble Freddy Krueger in Nighmate on Elm Street

She only uses paint and her natural talent to create celebrity faces, footballers, zombies, 3D effects and even gory cuts.

Since grabbing the headlines in June, Maria, who lives with husband Billy and children Sophia, 12, and Adam, 10, has gone on to fulfil her dream of teaching make-up tutorials.

The talented artist is able to give herself a picture-perfect likeness of other famous faces including A-list stars Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, Nelson Mandela and even football star Wayne Rooney.

The make-up artist, who is originally from Limerick, has always had a talent and passion for art, and particularly enjoyed pencil drawing and charcoal sketches as a child.

Business brain: Focusing on business and having two young children, Maria wasn't left with much time to focus on her art. When she turned 33, she decided that it was time she invested in her talents. Here, she can be seen as Johnny Depp's character in Dark Shadows 

After finishing school she applied to Limerick Art College, however Maria ended up turning down her place.

She explains: 'I felt at the time that there wasn’t anywhere for me to go with what I wanted to do, I didn’t want to be a standard artist. I loved special effects, particularly body and face art. 'I went to find out about it but there was literally nowhere in Limerick or Ireland that specialised in that kind up of make up art.'

Feeling frustrated she decided to move to London. Within three weeks she met her husband and together they have opened a line of cafe’s in the city.

Artistic: Speaking about her talent, she explains: 'I felt at the time that there wasn't anywhere for me to go with what I wanted to do, I didn't want to be a standard artist. I loved special effects, particularly body and face art' Right: As the terrifying masked killer Michael Myers from Halloween

Focusing on business and having two young children, Maria wasn’t left with much time to focus on her art. When she turned 33, she decided that it was time she invested in her talents.

She enrolled in Christine Blundell’s make up academy, which is based in Camden.

It wasn’t long before word of Maria’s skills spread and she was working at the Barbican on a play called The City Of Angels.

Soon after, she began working on BBC’s Switch and Channel Four production Horrible Histories and has since painted Phillip Schofield's face on This Morning and worked with Eamonn Holmes.
