The parents of murdered schoolgirl April Jones today told of their relief as their daughter's grave finally got its headstone more than two years after her death. 

Partly shaped like a teddy bear, the black granite stone features two Welsh verses in honour of the five-year-old, one about a butterfly and the other about a shooting star.

The stone has been put up near to the family home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, and April's parents Coral and Paul said they were pleased it had been completed in time for Christmas.

'It’s April down to a tee,' said Mrs Jones, 42. 'She loved her teddies and was fascinated by butterflies and shooting stars.

'We’ve been waiting two years for this day. It’s lovely that the headstone will be in place for Christmas and we plan to visit her on Christmas Day.'

Mr Jones, 46, added: 'It’s horrible seeing our daughter’s name on a cold stone in a graveyard but this is really lovely tribute to her.'

Fitting: Mrs Jones, 42, said the headstone was 'April down to a tee', as the little girl was 'fascinated by butterflies and shooting stars'

April was just five when she vanished from the close-knit Bryn-y-Gog estate on October 1st, 2012, while playing on her bike.

She was abducted by paedophile Mark Bridger who was found guilty of her murder after a month-long trial in May 2013.

April’s body has never been fully recovered despite the biggest search in UK police history, but Bridger was handed a rare whole life jail term after fragments of her skull were found in his fireplace.

The family held a funeral in September last year after her scant remains were released to them. She is buried in a graveyard just yards from where she was last seen alive.

Mr and Mrs Jones made an emotional visit to the cemetery yesterday, accompanied by one of their daughter’s favourite teddies.

Tender: The grave has been decorated with brightly-coloured flowers and photographs of April as a baby

Memories: Mrs Jones said that April was 'obsessed with Hello Kitty and, just before she was taken had put a Hello Kitty plaster on her favorite soft toy's paw

'All of April’s teddies were precious to her but this one is particularly special,' said Mr Jones.

'It’s a little dog which she loved. She was obsessed with Hello Kitty and, just before she was taken, she put a Hello Kitty plaster on his paw.

'We thought it was a nice touch to bring him here today.'

Mrs Jones added: 'Even though we had the funeral last year, we had to wait for the ground around April’s grave to settle before we could put the headstone up.

'It’s a massive relief now it’s finally here as before we just had a little tag with her name on it. It’s much more personal.'

Tragedy: April’s body was never fully recovered despite the biggest search in UK police history, but killer Mark Bridger was handed a rare whole life jail term after fragments of her skull were found in his fireplace

The couple and their older children, Jazmin, 19, and Harley, 12, spent hours deciding on the design of the stone, which was manufactured by James Memorials, based in nearby Aberystwyth.

The move comes just weeks after the house in which April is believed to have died was demolished. The Welsh government bought the cottage in remote Ceinws from its previous owner in order to raze it to the ground.

Mrs Jones said: 'We wanted it to be perfect so we chose everything as a family. April was very proud to be Welsh and she went to a Welsh speaking school so it’s nice to have the Welsh words. They’re beautiful.'

Mr Jones added: 'We’d like to thank everyone who has supported us over the past two years. We’ve had so many people fighting for us.

'If it wasn’t for the police, the search teams and the lawyers who worked on the case we might not have been able to bury April at all.'

Guilty: Mark Bridger was jailed for life for the murder of five-year-old April

Mark Bridger, who was jailed for life but has refused to admit to killing April, snatched the five-year-old as she played in the street near her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales.

Her disappearance sparked the largest police search in British history, and her killer tried to cover his tracks by helping with the search before his arrest.

Police believe Bridger dismembered April before dumping her body parts at various locations in the hills, rivers and forests surrounding his home in Ceinws, Mid Wales, after traces of her blood were found all over his rented cottage. 

Police raided his home and found evidence linked to the murder and a cache of child porn on his computer, including Facebook pictures of April and other local girls.

Pools of April's blood were found under the carpet in front of the living room fire where small fragments of her bones were recovered by police.

April's blood was also found in the bathroom and hallway of the cottage despite a desperate bid by Bridger to clean up his rented home using detergents and bleach. 

Father-of-six Bridger was given a whole-life tariff by a judge in May 2013 at Mold Crown Court after he was found guilty of her kidnap and murder.

Sentencing Bridger, Mr Justice Griffith Williams said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that you are a paedophile, who has for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls.'

He said Bridger abducted April for a 'sexual purpose' after he had been jilted by his girlfriend and then murdered the schoolgirl and disposed of her body to 'hide the evidence of your sexual abuse of her'.
