Scientists are still reviewing their findings but one thing is clear: there was a tsunami wave in New Jersey on June 13.

An unlikely occurrence on the country’s east coast, the wave was observed by several people at Barnegat Light State Park in Ocean County.

And three men were even sucked into the water.

Tsunami: Scientists say a wave like a tsunami struck this South Jersey inlet at Barnegat Light State Park June 13 and witnesses, three of whom were sucked into the water, corroborate the evidence

It happened during the afternoon, just after a weather system known as a low-end derecho.

The storm, a much stronger version of which took out power and caused destruction over a swath of the Midwest and East Coast last summer, had come to an end before the waves were detected by more than 30 tide gauges in the northwest Atlantic.

At around 3:30pm, Brian Coen was spearfishing near Barnegat Inlet. The sky was grey, but the weather had calmed and the tide was on its way out.

Coen said that’s when the water began to rush out of the inlet unusually fast. Rocks that what been submerged were suddenly revealed in the over one minute gush.

Rare: Quite unusual for the East Coast, the 6-foot gush occurred at this South Jersey inlet at Barnegat Light State Park

Derecho: NOAA scientists say the culprit, at least partially, could be the low-end derecho that swept across the eastern half of the country June 13

Wall of water: Brian Coen was spear fishing when he first saw water gush out of the inlet and then surge back in and described a 'wall of water' with six-foot waves

Meanwhile, Coen’s friends, who were diving below him, ‘drifted literally like a hundred yards in like 30 seconds’ he told WCAU.

Brian Coen then saw a 6-foot wave replace the receding waters, despite the outgoing tide.

‘There was whitewater across the whole mouth of the inlet,’ he said.

Three people were swept off the rocks of the nearby jetty by the wave and two required subsequent medical attention.

Weather induced? A satellite image shows the derecho as it approached the east coast June 13. Researchers called the causes of the wave ¿complex¿ and ¿still under review¿

‘It had a different kind of energy,’ Coen said. ‘More like a surge than an actual wave.’

Chuck Ebersole, steward at Wickford Yacht Club in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, said he saw a strong current of about 7 knots, or 8 miles per hour, going out through a channel into Narragansett Bay. Normally, he said, the current is 1 to 2 miles per hour. The current was so strong that one large boat pulled its cleat out of the dock, he said.

After a while, the current reversed at the same speed, he said. A nearby gauge recorded that the sea level changed by 1.3 feet.

Various factors are being analyzed, 
including the possibility that slumping at the Continental Shelf of New 
Jersey played a role.

‘From North Carolina up through Massachusetts, we can find
that signal, even though it's very small, which tells us there was something
going on,’ Mike Angove, head of NOAA's tsunami program, said Tuesday. ‘We're
trying to piece this back together.’

Angove stopped short of saying it was a 
tsunami, but acknowledged it had specific characteristics of one.

NOAA's
West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center posted a statement calling it a
tsunami.

Angove said it is a specific feature of tsunamis for water to be drawn out to sea and then rapidly rush back in, and the water speeds Ebersole reported in Rhode Island indicated something other than a storm surge.

He said researchers are looking for a cause. One possibility is a rare meteotsunami, which is a tsunami caused by weather. Or it could have been caused by a landslide off the continental shelf, which is less rare but still uncommon, he said.

'If we can't do that, it's going to be tough to put this egg back together,' he said.
