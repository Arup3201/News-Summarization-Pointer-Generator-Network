England will be punching above their weight if they reach the World Cup semi-finals, according to former Three Lions striker Gary Lineker.

The Match of the Day host believes Roy Hodgson's men have no chance of triumphing in Brazil and that making the last eight would represent success.

Lineker also thinks the former Fulham boss should focus on 'nurturing talent', rather than the pursuit of glory in South America.

Big future: Lineker believes Roy Hodgson should take young players like Ross Barkley to the World Cup

He said: 'We look in a much better place than we did six months ago, but let's be realistic.

'If we get to the quarter-finals, that will be a very good effort, if we get further than that, we will be punching above their weight.

'The conditions are not awful as it's their winter but no European team has won the World Cup in South America.'
