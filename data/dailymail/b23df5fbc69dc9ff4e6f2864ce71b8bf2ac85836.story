An Ohio man convicted in a fatal car crash was ordered to return to prison after writing an insensitive Facebook post boasting about his brief time behind bars.

Ryan Fye's questionable status update posted last month included a photo of him making an obscene gesture and a message saying in part, 'Prison didn't break me. It MADE me.'

Fye, 22, of Lorain, had been sentenced to three years in May. The post was made shortly after his early release last month.

The message upset relatives of William Fekete, 22, from Elyria, killed in the March 2013 crash. 

A judge found it disrespectful toward the family and concluded it violated sanctions imposed on Fye.

Defense attorney Michael Stepanik told local media that Fye didn't violate probation or the law. Fye was responding to a Facebook threat from someone who said they 'couldn't wait to bump into' him and that prison ought to have made him tough, Stepanik said.

'It wasn't a good idea,' Stepanik told WEWS-TV in Cleveland. 'Committing a crime is a probation violation, not abiding by the rules is a probation violation. Mr. Fye didn't do any of those things.'

On or around December 9, a defiant Mr Fye wrote what has been construed by some as a boastful message peppered with grammatical errors accompanying a photo of him giving his ‘haters’ the middle finger.

‘Prison didnt break me. It MADE made. Im free. Im a new man. Don't come at me like before. Yes im skinny and muscular now. 7 months of working out everyday. Love my real friends an fam. Shout outs to my fam behind bars. Ill see ya when youre time is near! Miss you brothers!’ he wrote.

Family outraged: Fye was released after only seven months in prison, leaving the victim's father, Vilmos Fekete, disappointed and clamoring for justice

Fye later removed the controversial status update and wrote another lengthy message insisting that his words had nothing to do with the fatal crash.

‘Its directed towards all the Fake friends i had and have, all the people trying to snoop and talk s*** about me like im some sort of monster. It has NOTHING to do with my case what so ever nor the parties involved in my case,’ Fye wrote.

‘Its a simple gesture to those who hate me, those who always called me fat, the ones who dawned on me, and of course me saying "f*** prison" cause prison isnt something i would wish upon my biggest enemy. Dont judge a book by its cover unless you plan on reading the whole book. Have a good day everyone!’ 

Fye's attorney is now challenging the judge's decision to put Fye back in custody. He argues that the posting isn't related to the rule Fye is accused of violating, which deals with how he conducts himself in court and with probation officers, The Chronicle-Telegram in Elyria reported.

On March 23, 2013, at around 4pm Ryan Fye was going 60mph in a 20mph zone in the Metroparks Bradley Woods Reservation when he lost control of his 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and crashed into a tree, reported Fox 8.

Fye had four passangers in his car at the time, including William Fye, who sustained fatal injuries and died in the hospital. Two other people were critically hurt but survived.

Fye pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular manslaughter in April and was sentenced in May to three years in prison, but was released in December after only seven months - a decision that outraged the victim's family and friends.

'Willie can rest in peace,' Fekete's father, Vilmos Fekete, wrote late last month after learning that his son's killer will be heading back to prison, possibly thanks to an open letter he had written to the judge about Fye's offensive Facebook note.

 A hearing is scheduled for January 15 for another judge to decide whether Fye has to continue serving his prison sentence.
