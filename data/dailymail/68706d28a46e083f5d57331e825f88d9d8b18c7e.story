One of the
 joys of this golfing season has been the Thursday masterclass from Rory
 McIlroy and the one delivered at Royal Aberdeen in the opening round of
 the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open was surely the best yet.

This
 one, delivered over one of Britain’s finest links courses, was so good 
it surely laid to rest any idea he still possesses shortcomings when it 
comes to this venerable form of the game.

And
 so alongside the 63s delivered at the Emirates course in Dubai and PGA 
National in Florida in February, and Muirfield Village in Ohio in May, 
comes a new course record 64 and a consummate demonstration of all he 
has learned since he vented his frustration over links golf after being 
blown away at Royal St George’s in 2011.

Now watch this drive: McIlroy hits off the tee during day one of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open

What a view: McIlroy, Jamie Donaldson and Thongchai Jaidee approach the 17th green during the first round

‘It’s obviously not my natural style of golf but I am determined to make it my favourite for two weeks every year,’ was the wry verdict of the 25 year old.

The highlight was undoubtedly the wind-assisted drive at the par four 13th, struck so hard and true it trickled on to the green fully 436 yards away. Ian Poulter was putting at the time.  ‘I only hit a three wood as well,’ said McIlroy to Poults jokingly, after the sheepish apology.

Yet it was the shots played into the wind that were really the most impressive. We all know how far Rory can hit it when he opens his shoulders. But here as well were the cut-down shots that you need to win Scottish Open and Open titles.

A gorgeous four iron at the par three seventh, for example, that only flew 160 yards – fully 70 yards less than McIlroy normally carries the ball through the air with that club. At the fifth he hit an eight iron that only travelled 120 yards, as against the more normal 170 yards.

It might not be his favoured form of golf but McIlroy is so good he still has a prized collection of low scores on links courses. A scarcely-credible 61 at Royal Portrush, for example, and a 63 at St Andrews. ‘Given how hard the front nine was playing, I’d definitely rate it right up there,’ said McIlroy. ‘I can’t remember shooting this low before on a links when the wind was this strong.’

Still, nobody will be thinking of handing him the trophy just yet. The other thing that binds those masterclasses together is they have invariably been followed by Friday horror shows, most notably with a 78 at Muirfield Village.

That one was so bad it drew a raised eyebrow from tournament host Jack Nicklaus. When the pair met for lunch a week later, it was still on the great man’s mind. ‘How do you go from a 63 to a 78?’ the Golden Bear good-naturedly enquired.

In fact, it was part of a curious run on Fridays that saw McIlroy shoot 40 or more for nine holes for four straight events on the PGA tour and five out of six tournaments.

‘I think it’s more mental than anything, just focusing too much on where I am on the leaderboard rather than going out and trying to play another solid round of golf,’ said McIlroy. ‘So that’s what I will be trying to do here in the second round.’

McIIroy, who leads by a shot from Swedish early bird Kristoffer Broberg – he was first man out at 6-30am – wasn’t the only big name to show up on the leaderboard.

Luke-ing good: Englishman Donald drives off the fourth tee on his way to an opening round of 67

Defending champion Phil Mickelson 
might have three-putted the 18th but a 68 still represented a solid 
start to his big fortnight, while his playing partner Luke Donald edged 
him with a 67.

Mickelson was
 typically good value, with an eagle three at the sixth and then an 
outrageous birdie at the 13th, after his drive finished on a paved path.
 A free drop was on offer but doing that would be boring, wouldn’t it? 
So Phil played a sand wedge approach off the path to 8ft and rolled in 
the birdie putt.

The 
American’s woes this year have been mainly to do with poor putting, and 
he was encouraged with his work in that department. ‘I was pleased with 
the way I putted,’ he said. ‘Even though I three putted the last, it was
 much better. It was a good round.’

This event is the start of a busy run 
for the stars, with most playing eight out of the next ten events before
 a week off and then the Ryder Cup. ‘What I’m looking for from these 
events is to build up some momentum,’ said Donald.

‘It’s
 been what I would call a choppy season to this point, with some good 
weeks but some poor ones. I need to shoot some low scores, so I can 
build up a head of steam.’

A
 four under par bogey-free round certainly represented a start in the 
right direction for the runaway winner of this event in 2011.

The
 players out in the morning had the best of the conditions, as the 
greens dried out and the wind changed direction. Justin Rose shot a fine
 69 but Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood both laboured, as they carded 
scores of 73 and 72 respectively. American Rickie Fowler shot 71 while 
Sir Nick Faldo, making a rare tournament appearance a week shy of his 
57th birthday, shot a creditable 73.
