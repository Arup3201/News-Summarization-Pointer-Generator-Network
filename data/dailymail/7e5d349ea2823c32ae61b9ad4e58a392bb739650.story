A 13-year-old boy has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of murder after he stamped on a woman so hard he left a shoe print on her face.

The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, punched charity worker Glynis Bensley, 47, in the head and stamped on her  before stealing her money, phone and jewellery.

Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in September last year.

The child robber stood trial alongside Zoheb Majid, 20, from Smethwick, who was found guilty of robbery and manslaughter.

A jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages a fortnight before the murder.

Mrs Bensley was on her way home from the Seven Stars when she was knocked to the ground by the schoolboy.

CCTV footage revealed that  Majid arrived on his bicycle moments later and the pair turned their victim over, stealing from her pockets.

A post-mortem examination of Ms Bensley revealed she died from a severe bleed on the brain.

After the attack, the schoolboy fled to nearby Victoria Park to meet up with friends and was heard boasting about the murder and selling a gold bracelet. 

Both robbers claimed they believed the victim was a man because of Ms Bensley's clothing and hairstyle.

Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted.

'They were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other.

'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet.

'The brutal attack was captured on CCTV lasting 32 seconds.

'Our thoughts remain with Glynis' family at this time and we hope that today's verdict will provide some help in their grieving process.' 

Ms Bensley's sister Dawn, 55, from Smethwick, said: 'We are a very close and supportive family and always look out for each other.

'To try and explain how Glynis' murder has affected us is very hard to put into words.

'Glynis was my only sister and best friend. I would describe her as my right arm and I thought we would grow old together.'

A full statement from the victim's family read: 'We as individuals and collectively as a family have lost a great friend.

'We are unable to express in words the impact that our loss is having on our family.

'Whilst we get on with the day-to-day trivialities of life, the circumstances of Glynis' death remind us all of the important things in life.

'At the time of Glynis' death she was upbeat and looking forward to family holidays and celebrations including her own birthday later that month.

'Glynis spent her life caring for others working in roles for the British Heart Foundation, animal welfare, and was also an active fundraiser for charity's Cancer Research, Mencap and Cystic Fibrosis.

'The family would like to acknowledge and thank the family liaison team for taking us through this dark period.

'They would also like to offer sincere thanks to Mr Atkins QC and the investigation team.'
