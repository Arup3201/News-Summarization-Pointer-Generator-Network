Campaigners are calling for a  ban on the E numbers that give  children’s medicines such as Calpol their bright colours.

They have identified 52 products – including teething gels and painkillers designed for babies as young as two months – which contain additives linked to hyperactivity.

The artificial colours have effectively been banned from children’s food following research at the University of Southampton in 2005.

The E number medicines: There are 52 remedies that make children hyperactive, campaigners claim

But the ‘Southampton Seven’ additives – six artificial colours and one preservative – still appear in medicines aimed at youngsters. Calpol, for example, gets its distinctive pink shade from carmoisine (E122).

Now health campaigners at Action On Additives are calling for the use of the additives in medicines to be outlawed. Co-ordinator Lizzie Vann Thrasher said: ‘Some of our most trusted children’s medicines contain unnecessary colourings that have been linked to hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders.

‘Manufacturers should follow the example of the food and drinks industry and remove these colourings from children’s medicines.’

The suspect colours are tartrazine (E102); quinoline yellow (E104); sunset yellow (E110); carmoisine (E122); ponceau 4R (E124); and allura red (E129). The seventh additive is the preservative sodium benzoate (E211).

The campaign group’s study, released today, reports that four of the six E numbers were found in 19 children’s medicines, including Calpol Paracetamol Infant Suspension, Boots Paracetamol Oral Suspension, Anbesol Teething Gel and some prescription drugs.

Food colourings linked to hyperactivity should be banned from children's medicines, the charity Action of Additives has warned

The Calpol product is designed for babies as young as two months, the Boots product for those three months and up and the Anbesol for teething babies.

The preservative was in 37 children’s medicines, including a Boots cough syrup, Tixylix and six different Benylin cough mixtures or syrups.

Four medicines contained both a colouring and the preservative.

Vyvyan Howard, professor of bio-imaging at Ulster University and an expert on child brain development, backed the call for a ban, while public health nutritionist Dr Helen Crawley urged manufacturers to remove the additives from medicines ‘as a matter of urgency’.

Currently, under EU law synthetic colourings are banned from food and drinks targeted specifically at children under 36 months.

Separately, Britain’s Food Standards Agency has successfully put pressure on manufacturers to remove the artificial colours identified in the Southampton research from food for older children.

But there is no law stopping their use in medicines.

Industry watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is encouraging firms to remove the colours from medicines but has no legal powers to go further.

Action On Additives said it is time for a legal ban on use of the E numbers both in food and in medicine. It is calling on parents to protest directly to the manufacturers and the MHRA to demand action.

Johnson & Johnson, which makes Calpol, confirmed it contains carmoisine and sodium benzoate, but said both had been approved by the MHRA and insisted there was ‘no evidence to suggest additives … are associated with hyperactivity when present in children’s medicines’.

It added: ‘The consumption of food and drink is very different to the consumption of medicines. Over-the-counter medicines are only intended for occasional use in small quantities over a very short period of time.’

It argued the colours are important because they allow patients and healthcare professionals to identify a medicine on sight.

Alliance Pharmaceutical, which  makes Anbesol Teething Gel, said it complied with MHRA and European Commission guidelines.
