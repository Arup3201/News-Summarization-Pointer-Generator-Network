Richard Madeley has said he refuses to listen to the Today programme on Radio 4 when it is only presented by men because he finds it too ‘pompous’ and ‘aggressive’.

The broadcaster, who co-presented This Morning and Richard & Judy with his wife for 20 years, said he believes TV and radio shows are better when they are presented by both men and women.

He said: ‘When I listen to the Today in the morning if it’s two fellows doing it I find it a bit of a turn off. I find it a bit one note, rather pompous and it can be very aggressive. I find it much more listenable to when it’s a mixed pairing.

‘I don’t listen to the Today programme all the time because frankly I find it a rather pompous programme.

'And
I find if you look at regional television news programmes, don’t you 
find them less watchable when it’s two blokes in suits as opposed to 
when it’s a man and a woman?’

Mr Madeley, 56, who was speaking 
about the role of women in broadcasting at the Radio Conference in 
Salford, said that he thinks that many women are not as competitive as 
men.

He said: ‘My own wife,
who is one of the most successful television presenters in the last 20 
or 30 years, is the most reluctant television presenter you can find.

'She lacks almost any pushiness or 
competitiveness. Taken as a general rule, women are less competitive 
than men and do not like being competitive with men.

‘Quite
often when there has been pairing of a man and a women, early on in 
their relationship, it’s the man who sticks his elbows out, it’s the man
who pinches the "Hello, good evening and welcome" line; it’s the man 
who steals the limelight.’

He pointed to the example of Anthea 
Turner and Eamonn Holmes who co-presented GMTV for two years in the 
1990s before she left the programme.

He
said: ‘I mean, Anthea was nobody’s pushover, but Eamonn muscled her 
out. He did it through masculinity and assertiveness and if women are 
not prepared to get out they do get pushed to one side.’

Mr
Madeley said the success of his broadcasting partnership with his wife 
of 26 years is because of their rules about taking turns.

He said: ‘We had a very conscious policy
of being equal and not to be played off against each other. Because we 
were married and loved each other we had rules, so if I opened This 
Morning on Monday she would open on Tuesday.

'It kept the peace and it kept the 
balance. From time to time a producer would say "Richard, I think you 
should do this interview with so-and-so" and I’d say "No, we’ll do it 
together" or "No, it’s Judy’s turn."

'Judy was always more popular and you could just tell that when we went out. Women viewers loved Judy, they kind of put up with me, but they loved Judy.'

He added that he believed that Margaret Thatcher had set back women’s equality because of the way she was derided for being a strong woman.

He said: ‘I do think a lot of the sexism that Margaret Thatcher had to put up with, with expressions such as handbagging, was appalling and really damaging to women.

'In many ways I think her premiership was counter-productive in terms of women as strong figures as she was derided for being a strong woman.

‘Whatever you thought of her politics she was a hugely effective female politician.’
