Gordon Ramsay is embroiled in a legal battle with a Tenerife restaurant critics claim is trading on his name four years after first complaining about the establishment. 

In 2010 the TV chef reportedly took legal action against Gordon Ransay's in the holiday resort of Puerto Colon.

The restaurant, which serves full English breakfasts and 'the coldest pint in town', said at the time it had been paying Mr Ramsay to use his name.

Four years later, the restaurant is still thriving despite Mr Ramsay's protestations, with customers leaving reviews for its service online as recently as in October.

Giving evidence in a separate case at the High Court, the chef said: 'We get thousands of complaints about this restaurant called Gordon Ramsay in Tenerife selling a full English with extra bacon at 4.95 Euros.’ 

A spokesman for the star said his legal team continued to pursue action against the proprietors of the restaurant. 

'Through our London based lawyers we have instructed‎ local lawyers who our pursuing the legal options available to us to protect our rights,' she told MailOnline. 

'As this is an ‎ongoing legal matter I‎ cannot comment further at this time.'

The Tenerife restaurant has attracted scores of reviews on TripAdvisor, with many customers noticing the similarity in its name to that of a famous chef.

In one post titled 'It's not Ramsay!', a customer said: 'Has anyone noticed it's RaNsay not Ramsay...' while another said: 'It is definitely nothing to do wit (sic) Gordon Ramsay.' 

Others left scathing reviews of meals they say were uncooked or hadn't been defrosted properly. 

Among comments left in the forum, other customers said the owner told them he was a friend and colleague of the TV chef. 

When contacted for comment the restaurant's telephone line disengaged. Its website is no longer in use.  

Last year Mr Ramsay appeared at the High Court with his wife Tana with regard to the lease on one of his London restaurants. 

The chef took a 25 year lease for the York and Albany in Regent's Park, but claims he should not be held personally liable for the £640,000-a-year rent bill. 

During the case the court heard details of Mr Ramsay's tumultuous relationship with his father-in-law, Christopher Hutcheson, the former CEO of Gordon Ramsay Holdings.

The men have been estranged since Mr Hutcheson's departure from the company in 2010.
