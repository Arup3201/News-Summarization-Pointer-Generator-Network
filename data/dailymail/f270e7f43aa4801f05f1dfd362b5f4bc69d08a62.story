Storing up experience: Ben pictured outside the Amazon fulfillment centre he works at

With all the subtlety of an angry bear, the alarm on my phone  wrestles me from my brief, blissful slumber. Cold and tired, I peel myself from the sheets, feeling the stiffness in my legs and the dull ache in the soles of my feet as they reluctantly touch the floor.

Dead to the world, I push a toothbrush around my mouth, trying to avoid eye  contact with the zombie in the mirror.

I pull on the battered trainers, tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt I'd dropped on the bedroom floor seconds before falling asleep last night, zip up my windproof jacket, clip my bike lights into place and set off on the hour-long ride to work. Meanwhile, the kitchen clock shows 5.30am.

Once at work, I punch a code into a drinks machine and watch it spit tea into a paper cup, while other exhausted ghosts limp into view and exchange supportive nods of acknowledgment.

I just have time to wolf down a breakfast cereal bar before my shift starts at 7am.  For the next 11-and-a-half-hours, I will be pushing a trolley around a giant warehouse in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

It's back-breaking work - I will probably walk a total of 20 miles today - just one ant among 1,500 others, scurrying around a vast complex of jaw-dropping logistical genius and breath-taking productivity.

I don't think I have ever felt so exhausted in my life.

I am working for Amazon at one of its eight UK fulfilment centres - the huge warehouses which store, process, package and deliver the online retailer's stock,  during the Christmas rush.

This is not what I thought I'd end up doing, the Christmas after graduating from Jesus College Cambridge with a 2:1 degree in music. I'd hoped to be an officer in the Royal Navy by now - or earning good money as a jobbing musican, while the application process limped along. But work was  irregular and sometimes badly paid. I tried, and failed, to find other employment and reluctantly had to sign on the dole - something I prayed I'd never have to do.

At Amazon, I am paid £7 an hour and have to work 55 hours a week, with no choice of when I do them. If I'm lucky, though, I can pick between day or night shifts.

Does this mean I'm ungrateful? Certainly not. Nor does it mean I am the only graduate from an elite university working here.

Far from being surrounded by uneducated manual workers, I am pushing my trolley alongside law graduates, classicists and mathematicians, many from top universities like mine.

Queueing up in the Amazon  canteen the other day, I overheard two people discussing where they did their Masters. It's a common conversation-opener here.

You are, in fact, just as likely to find someone to discuss the works of Pliny and Proust with, as you are to find a drinking partner for the pub.

Far from being lazy and workshy, as is the current lament from employers about young British workers, none of my colleagues is complaining. They, like me, are grateful for the work - any work.

It makes me smile when I think of all the people who will be opening the Christmas presents delivered by Amazon next week: books, DVDs and more. Who among them could guess at the sheer intellectual weight and quality of education behind the service?

For it is hard out there. In the past six months, I must have applied for every job imaginable. One of them involved knocking on doors to sell double-glazing.

'Work hard, and you might earn as much as £200 in your first week,' we were told at interview. The next day I was rung to be told: 'We're sorry Mr Atkins, but we had 30 people applying for two jobs.'

Academic potential: Ben did so well at Winchester that he was admitted to Cambridge

Desperate for work, I even left a note on the windscreen of a  pick-up truck, offering to split the logs it was loaded with.

Then my adviser at the JobCentre told me Amazon was recruiting, and suggested I apply.

It is the world's largest online retailer, with a revenue four times greater than that of the next largest, eBay, and exceeding the GDPs of half the countries in the world.

On average, it serves 20 million customers worldwide daily, and on December 2 this year Amazon UK beat the record it set just three days earlier by  selling 4.1 million items in one day –- or 47 a second.

To respond to demand, 15,000 extra people are employed over the festive period at Amazon's UK warehouses.

When I went for my induction, I was desperate to become one of them - despite my privileged education.

About eight of us, aged between 20 and 40, were quizzed by a recruitment agency. The first question was whether we had our passports as ID. At this point, one member of the group left. He simply didn't possess one.

Then we were told that there would be a drugs test and everyone would also be Criminal Records Bureau tested - and wouldn't be allowed to work if we had any unspent convictions. Again, the group diminished.

The remaining five of us sat a simple test, after which another person was escorted from the room. After signing a few forms and peeing into a cup, the now select group was told: 'Training is at eight o'clock tomorrow, and you start work the day after that.'

Apparently my tutor wasn't joking when he said I'd never be asked what class of degree I have.

I soon got talking to Richard, who has worked for Amazon since the summer. 'I studied criminology with a view to becoming a policeman,' he explained. 'Only the week I graduated, the Government cut thousands of police jobs.

'I still want to join the force, or become a fireman, but for now this job is fine. What would be the point of taking a stand and refusing to do a job because I consider it below me? What's the alternative? I'd rather be working than doing nothing.'

Henry is married, probably in his early 50s. He left the Army to study employment law. He's working for Amazon so he can save up to do his Masters at Cambridge and become a lecturer.

For every graduate employed by Amazon this Christmas, there are several more who didn't make it: including my elder brother, Alexander. He read maths at Cambridge and has just finished a computer science Masters at Bristol.

On my second day at work, I called him during a precious break to tell him about the job and he rushed home from Bristol, just in time for an induction on the last day of recruitment. But the news was not what he had hoped. Despite passing all the tests, Alex was surplus to requirements.

He's on the waiting list now, and hoping for a phone call in case an employee calls in sick.

He is not alone. He lives with two other Bristol graduates: one is still jobless and the other has been working as a part-time shop assistant for 18 months.

Heightened demand: Over the holidays, 15,000 extra people are employed at Amazon's UK warehouses - but many of those hoping for work are nonetheless turned away

When my older sister, Serena, left Cambridge, a friend with a First in history was obliged to work for the first six months completely unpaid - something only the privileged can afford - while my sister spent months trying to get an interview.

My other sister Bink also graduated from Cambridge this summer with a good 2:1 in classics, but is still unemployed.

For me, the job is worth more than just Christmas money. Like many Cambridge students, and unlike many of my new colleagues, I had a privileged upbringing.

Although my father, a clergyman, has never earned much and nor does my writer mother, I was extremely fortunate to be given a bursary to Winchester College.

Less fortunate: Alexander, Ben's brother, read maths at Cambridge and has just finished a computer science Masters at Bristol. He hopes to find employment at Amazon

I wasn't a sheltered upbringing  - we lived in an inner-city vicarage, and often cared for the homeless. But most of my schoolfriends had little experience of life outside their elite social class.

If my application to become a Naval officer is successful, I will serve on a warship alongside ratings (non-officers). This is considered to be one of the most important elements of training.

I feel that working a Christmas season in an Amazon fulfilment centre is ample preparation. In here, we are all equal - just  workers, grafting to get the job done, and I relish the experience.

As soon as I swipe my access card and enter the building, I am no longer a privileged individual, just a small cog in a vast machine.

It is a humbling experience, and one I hope to remember wherever life takes me.

And there are other perks in the meantime: on my first day I was taken to the top floor of the building, from where I could see the vast crates brimming with Christmas presents. Quite unexpectedly, something stirred inside me, and I couldn't wait to tell my ten-year-old youngest sister that I am  working in Santa's grotto because, let's face it, this is it, in reality.

Now who could complain about having that on their CV?
