Jailed: Ian Maxwell, 61, from Wrexham in Wales - pictured here with grey hair and sunglasses - tricked three women into investing their life savings through him

A Falklands RAF pilot who callously duped his two elderly aunties and a third woman out of a total of £312,000 has been jailed for two years today.

Businessman and financial adviser Ian Maxwell, 61, from Wrexham in Wales tricked the three women into investing their savings through him.

One of his aunties, who suffers from dementia, was left £10,000 overdrawn and financially ruined after Maxwell blew her money and that of the two other women on items such as jewellery and an expensive car, Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales heard.

Judge Niclas Parry told the father: 'These were despicable offences which have led to financial ruination for vulnerable, elderly victims.

'The case involved a serious breach of trust.

Your elderly and mentally vulnerable victims trusted you professionally with their life savings.

'Some of the money was wasted on items of lavish luxury.'

Maxwell admitted seven fraud offences between 2002 and 2008 and £250,000 is still unaccounted for.

Prosecutor Jonathan Austin said aunt Vera Davies, in her 80s, gave Maxwell £35,000 to invest in an Australian company, to generate an income, having been assured by him that her cash would be safe.

But Maxwell didn’t invest the money and monthly payments by him totaling £27,000 had been paid with her own cash or other money that he had.

The barrister said the payments stopped in 2007 when Maxwell was in financial difficulties.

Mrs Davies’s sister Dilys Williams, who died in 2010, was swindled out of £172,500. She suffered from dementia and was extremely vulnerable.

'She couldn’t handle her own finances. In 2005 the defendant obtained an enduring power of attorney over her finances. It’s clear she trusted the defendant,' Mr Austin said.

'That money was used to help his failing business interests.'

Using his power of attorney, cash was transferred to him. Mrs Williams had to live in a residential home but monthly payments from her savings couldn’t be made, cheques bounced and she became £10,000 in the red.

Counsel said eventually social services approached the Court of Protection to overwrite his power of attorney.

The third victim was Judith Rich from Bath who is in her 60s . She made four payments totaling £105,000 for Maxwell to invest in Australia in return for a monthly income.

She got back £32,000 over the years but in 2007 payments to her stopped.

Mr Austin said : 'She asked for her money back and never got it and had to seek financial assistance from her local authority because of the impecunious position she found herself in.'

The money had been her 'nest egg' for the future.

The prosecutor said £250,000 was outstanding and Maxwell stood to benefit by £16,000 from Mrs Williams’s estate.

Defence barrister John Wyn Williams told the judge it was a 'tragic day for Mr Maxwell and his family.' Counsel declared : 'He stands before you a broken man.

'From his high achievements in life he’s spiralled down to the bottom, facing a custodial sentence.

'His wife, his daughters and brother-in-law are here to support him on this difficult day for the family. They are ashamed and embarrassed about what has happened in his life.'

Maxwell’s business began to falter in 2007 when he lost money in Pakistan. 'He wanted to shore up that business and it was that temptation which led him to these offences,' counsel explained.

There were 'glowing' testimonials. He was a former school head boy, excelled at sport, took a chemistry degree, and was an RAF flight commander in the Falklands. He now had health problems.

Mr Wyn Williams said : 'He initially borrowed the money with the intention of repaying it. He wants me to apologise for his actions. He wishes dearly that he could turn back the clock.'
