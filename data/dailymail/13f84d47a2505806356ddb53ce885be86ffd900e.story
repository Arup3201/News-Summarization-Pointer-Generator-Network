The days of spraying yourself with overpowering deodorant could be over. 

A ‘smart can’ has been created that tells you exactly how much deodorant to apply, and even reminds you when you've forgotten to put any on.

Called ClickStick, the device uses a button to expel a certain amount of gel from its top, which is then rubbed into skin like a traditional stick deodorant.

A New Jersey student has designed a smart deodarant application device. Called the ClickStick, it has a button that releases a set amount of gel. This is determined by an app that syncs with the stick

By using an included app, the user is told how much gel to release each time based on their activity levels, ensuring they don’t get too much or too little. 

Graduate student Gilad Arwatz from New Jersey is currently seeking funding for the gadget on Kickstarter.

The bottle, which is about the size of a regular deodorant can, has a button on the side that is pressed to dispense gel.

But the main ‘smart’ feature of the device is the ability to sync with a smartphone app.

In the app users enter your height, weight, age, activity level and gender.

The gadget will then determine how much deodorant to apply when the button is pressed, which can be altered with an adjustable slide button.

The gadget will then determine how much deodorant to apply when the button is pressed, which can be altered with an adjustable slide buttom. It costs £16 ($26) and will be released in May next year.

Push-button deodorant delivery - Electronic dispensing claims to avoid stains and skin irritations.

Refillable - ClickStick claims to be the first refillable deodorant applicator.

Mobile app - The gadget has a mobile app included that provides insights on the amount of deodorant needed, based on your activity level. 

Light activated - The cap and application of the deodorant is illuminated with different colour LED lights. 

Cap activated power switch- ClickStick's says power switch prevents accidental operation when the cap is on the device. 

Each press of the button will only release one dosage, and users can set reminders for when to apply deodorant.

The gadget is also refillable, so new gel cartridges can be bought to fit into the device.

'ClickStick is a smart reusable deodorant applicator, with eco-friendly refills that come with any deodorant,' the company writes on their Kickstarter page.

Users can even set up automatic refills so that a new pack is ordered when the app detects they are running out.

The product also has a light that can be activated to make seeing the gadget easier in dark rooms. 

The team expects to start delivering £16 ($26) ClickSticks to backers next May.
