A suspected burglar spent five hours hanging upside down from a window after apparently getting trapped when trying to break into a university.

The man got stuck while attempting to squeeze through a 30in-wide window at Nottingham Trent University in freezing temperatures last Thursday night.

He was found by two students, who heard him calling for help and then saw his legs dangling out of the side of the lecture hall building.

Stuck: A suspected burglar was trapped in a window after trying and failing to climb into a building

Found: Tom Burdett, pictured left with a firefighter, was one of two students to stumble across the man

Dan De-Niet and Tom Burdett called 999 so that firefighters could free the man - but not before they had taken dozens of photographs as well as a video clip.

The suspect was given medical treatment and later arrested. He has now been charged with burglary with intent to steal.

Mr De-Niet, 20, a first-year property and finance student, told student newspaper The Tab: 'We were walking home from a night out when we literally stumbled across the guy.

'I bet Tom I could jump over the fence and race through before he walked around - when I was running past the building I heard crying and shouting and saw these legs dangling upside down from the top window of the offices.

'I assumed he was a drunk student trying to get into the university and I called to Tom and we started filming it all because we thought it was pretty funny.

Stranded: The man reached a first-floor window before getting stuck

Arrest: The suspect was later taken into custody by police and charged with burglary

'He was crying out shouting "Let me go" and I dialled 999 and told the operator what had happened. Two fire engines and three police cars arrived and they had to cut the guy out of the window.

'The police took him away in handcuffs and we carried on home. I have to say it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.'

Mr Burdett, a 19-year-old history student, added: 'I heard Dan shouting and ran over towards him. Then we saw the guy stuck in the window.

'After laughing my head off for a while, Dan then called the fire service and the police and the university security. He said "I've been here for five hours" and I erupted into laughter.

Helping hand: Even the emergency services found the bizarre situation hilarious

Location: The incident took place at Nottingham Trent University's Arkwright building

'The police also found it hilarious and a few of them took photos and there were a few jokes and then they got serious about it. I believe they had to remove the whole window in the end.'

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Fire Service said: 'Firefighters were called to an incident at 2.51am on January 23, 2015 after a man became stuck in a window.

'Crews from Central along with both the Rapid Response Units and Special Rescue Units from Highfields and Tuxford attended the incident at the Arkwright building at Nottingham Trent University on Shakespeare Street.

'They used a saw and a ladder to free the man and he was put into the care of the East Midlands Ambulance Service.'

A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said: 'We have charged Carl Attar, 27, with burglary other than dwelling with intent to steal.'
