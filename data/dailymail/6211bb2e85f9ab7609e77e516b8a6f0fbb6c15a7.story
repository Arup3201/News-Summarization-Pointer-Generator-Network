Two coastguard patrol boats blasted each other with water cannon as tensions escalated over the ownership of a tiny group of rocky islands in the South China Sea.

The Japanese vessel opened fire on its Taiwanese rival as the ship encroached on the disputed land - which is also claimed by China - earlier today.

In a bid to repel the approaching flotilla, they opened fire with their powerful water arsenal. But the Taiwanese boats fired back with their own spray guns sparking a ferocious water fight.

In the end, the might of Japan proved too strong for their Taiwanese counterparts, who eventually turned on their tails and headed home.

It was the latest confrontation over the uninhabited islands Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.

China, Japan and Taiwan all claim the islands, but they are administered by Tokyo, since the Japanese government bought them from private owners two weeks ago.

The move, which infuriated Beijing, 
was intended by Japan's government to fend off what it feared would be 
seen as an even more provocative plan by the nationalist governor of 
Tokyo to buy and build facilities on the islands.

In response, China sent six surveillance ships to the area, which contains potentially large gas reserves.

There were scenes of violent disorder as anti-Japan protests erupted in China.

Japanese
 factories were forced to temporarily close in China and expatriate 
workers advised to stay indoors after angry demonstrations spilled on to
 the streets.

There were 
violent attacks on well-known Japanese businesses in China, such as 
car-makers Toyota and Honda, in the country's worst outbreak of 
anti-Japan sentiment in decades.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Chikao Kawai, flanked by their aides, held a meeting on the dispute on Tuesday at China's Foreign Ministry.

While both governments appeared publicly to be seeking to calm tensions, gamesmanship around the islands continues.

Diplomatic tensions: Around 40 Taiwanese fishing boats were joined by 12 Taiwanese government patrol boats in approaching the islands, and some of them violated Japanese territorial waters, Japanese coastguard officials said

In today's confrontation, around 40 
Taiwanese fishing boats were joined by 12 Taiwanese government patrol 
boats in approaching the islands, and some of them violated Japanese 
territorial waters, Japanese coastguard officials said.

After water cannon were fired on both sides, the Taiwanese boats left Japanese waters, they said.

Taiwan's government-owned Central News Agency said 75 Taiwanese fishing boats, escorted by coast guard ships, entered waters surrounding the islands to assert Taiwan's sovereignty over the disputed territory.

Relations between the two countries deteriorated sharply after Japan bought the islands, which are called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China

The arrival of Taiwan vessels in the 
area could complicate the potentially fraught game of cat-and-mouse 
being played near the islands, where mainland China has launched an 
effort to assert sovereignty by sending government ships into the 
disputed waters.

China sent its first aircraft carrier into formal service today amid a tense maritime dispute with Japan, a show of naval force that could worry its neighbours.

China's Ministry of Defence said the newly named Liaoning aircraft carrier would 'raise the overall operational strength of the Chinese navy' and help Beijing to 'effectively protect national sovereignty, security and development interests'.

In fact, the aircraft carrier, refitted from a ship bought from Ukraine, will have a limited role, mostly for training and testing ahead of the possible launch of China's first domestically built carriers after 2015, analysts say.

But China cast the formal handing over of the carrier to its navy as a triumphant show of national strength - at a time of bitter tensions with neighbouring Japan over islands claimed by both sides.

'China will never tolerate any bilateral actions by Japan that harm Chinese territorial sovereignty,' Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said on Tuesday. 'Japan must banish illusions, undertake searching reflection and use concrete actions to amend its errors, returning to the consensus and understandings reached between our two countries' leaders.'

Chinese boats have also briefly 
entered the waters around the islands, but Japanese coast guard vessels 
didn't fire water cannon at them.

A
 coast guard official said Chinese vessels usually exit the Japanese 
waters more quickly after verbal warnings, without forcing Japanese 
patrol ships to take physical action.

The
 Taiwan fishing group said their boats would sail around the islands to 
reassert their right to fish there and did not rule out trying to land 
on the rocky isles.

Taiwan Defence Minister Kao Hua-chu told parliament that the military was ready for any contingency, but did not elaborate.

Taiwan
 has traditionally had friendly ties with Japan, but the two countries 
have long squabbled over fishing rights in the area.

Beijing deems 
Taiwan to be an illegitimate breakaway province, and the two sides both 
argue they have inherited China's historic sovereignty over the islands,
 which are near rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas 
reserves.

The latest 
flare-up in tensions over the islands comes at a time when both China 
and Japan confront domestic political pressures. Japanese Prime Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda's government faces an election in months, adding 
pressure on him not to look weak on China.

China's
 Communist Party is preoccupied with a leadership turnover, with 
President Hu Jintao due to step down as party leader at a congress that 
could open as soon as next month.

Noda
 leaves for New York on Monday to take part in the annual gathering of 
the U.N. General Assembly, and attention will focus on whether he refers
 to the dispute.

Worries are
 simmering that the row could hurt the economic ties that closely bind 
China and Japan. China is Japan's largest trading partner. In 2011, 
their bilateral trade grew 14.3 percent in value to a record $345 
billion.

Tokyo's Nikkei 
China 50 index, composed of stocks of Japanese companies with 
significant exposure to the world's second-largest economy, shed about 
1.3 percent on concerns over the dispute.

Bank
 of America Merrill Lynch said Japanese car manufacturers saw a 90 
percent drop in showroom traffic and a 60 percent fall in sales in the 
southern Chinese province of Guangdong, the largest market for Japanese 
brands, since the beginning of the anti-Japan protests.
