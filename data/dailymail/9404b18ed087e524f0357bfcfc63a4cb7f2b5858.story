The Sicilian mafia ordered the assassination of former mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani, a court in Palermo has heard.

‘Boss of all bosses’ Salvatore ‘Toto’ Riina, allegedly planned the hit when Giuliani was a state prosecutor in the 1980s.

Giuliani, a second generation Italian immigrant, went on to become the city’s mayor and a national hero for his work combatting organised crime.

The plot was revealed in evidence from supergrass Rosario Naimo, at a trial in Sicily in which representatives of the Italian state are accused of signing a peace treaty with the mafia in the 1990s.

The claim that Giuliani was a target was made by supergrass Rosario Naimo

Former mafioso Naimo told the prosecutor that Riina, who is serving multiple life sentences for dozens of homicides, dispatched his henchman to the US to organise the murder, Italian news agency ANSA reported.

Naimo, who lived in the US for years, claims a sworn Mafioso, or ‘man of honour’, named Benedetto Villico, approached him with a letter from Riina, nicknamed the Beast because of his love for violence.

The letter ordered Giuliani’s death.

Giuliani has previously claimed that there was a price on his head during the 1990s, when he was mayor.

He told Oprah Winfrey last year: ‘They offered $800,000 to kill me. Then toward the end of the time I was mayor, a particular mafia guy who was convicted and put in jail for 100 years put out a contract to kill me for $400,000. I kind of felt bad that I went down in value.’

Ties: Giuliani was a target because of his friendship with Italian judge Giovanni Falcone

Giuliani became a target because of his friendship with Sicilian anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, who led a crack-down on the Cosa Nostra clans.

While Giuliani's own clampdown in the U.S. won him national acclaim, Falcone was assassinated by Riina’s cohorts in 1992.

Riina laid aside his plans for Giuliani after realising that US authorities had the power to destroy the Sicilian mob, website Palermo Today said.

Riina was nicknamed 'The Beast' for his violent behavior, and was known for his tendency to target high-profile officials in an attempt to scare them into dropping cases. (He also had a less-frightening title- The short One- based on his height.)

Naimo became a member of the Sicilian mafia in 1965 and was thought by police to be its head when he moved to the U.S in 1968.

Toto Riina once described him as being 'more powerful than the President of the United States'.

It comes as little surprise that Giuliani attracted the attention of the mob as he spent much of the 1980s climbing up the political ladder by way of his legal career.

After studying law and clerking for a district judge in New York, he served as an Associate District Attorney General during President Ford's administration and went into a private practice when the Democratic Carter administration came into power.

During President Reagan's reign, Giuliani was named an Associate Attorney General which made him the third-highest ranking member of the Justice Department.

He returned to his home state of New York in 1983 and launched several high-profile initiatives in the Southern District which oversees Manhattan and the four boroughs.

He was known for taking on high-profile cases that ranged from drug dealers and financial corruption but the ones that undoubtedly ruffled feathers within the mafia undoubtedly were his cases against organized crime families.

He was one of the most visible lawyers involved with the Mafia Commission Trial that spanned from February 1085 to November 1986 and led to the indictments of 11 major organized crime figures.

The alleged hit against Giuliani is not the only surprising revelation to have come out of Italian courts of late, as a separate trial in January unearthed a plot to blow up the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

The plot was hatched in 1992, when the Mafia had declared war on the state, embarking on a series of attacks on police and judges, as well as civilian targets such as museums and trains.

Supergrass Gioacchino La Barbera told the court in Janurary how convicted terrorist Paolo Bellini suggested the target to his mafia associates, during the years of terror.

Bellini, nicknamed The Black Primrose, said that they should stop bombing civilian targets and hit Italy’s artistic treasures instead.

The court heard how he persuaded boss Nino Gioe that the impact of such a blast would be more powerful, saying: ‘Just imagine. What if Pisa woke up and the Tower wasn’t there!?’ 

The explosives that were prepared for the attack were eventually discovered by the police. But the plot was shelved after sweeping arrests in 1993, including Riina, the court was told.
