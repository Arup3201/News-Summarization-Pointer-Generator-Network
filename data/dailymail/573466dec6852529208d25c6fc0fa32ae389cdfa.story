Incoming freshmen at Georgia Tech in Atlanta got the most memorable welcome speech of all time from an upperclassman who encouraged the class of 2018 to not just stand on but ‘CRUSH the shoulders of giants!’

To the slowly building theme music of 2001: A Space Odyssey theme, Nick Selby’s speech began as most typically do but crescendoed into a convocation address so epic and inspired that each fresh-faced student in attendance is sure to walk into their first class ready, in Selby’s words, ‘to do the impossible.’

Even if that means building the Iron Man suit.

Starts slow: Georgia Tech sophomore Nick Selby's freshman welcome speech began with typical advice then became an unforgettable address like none other

Selby is part infomercial salesman, part evangelist, and Georgia Tech school spirit.

He gives a typical uplifting speech quote: 'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.'

But it’s only for mocking purposes. Stock quotes are not Selby’s style.

‘Our mission as students is NOT to follow in the footsteps of the astronauts, Nobel Prize Laureates, and president who graduated before us, but to EXCEED their footsteps,’ bellowed the mechanical engineering student. ‘CRUSH the shoulders of the giants upon whom we stand!'

'You can do that!': The theme to 2001: A Space Odyssey was fitting backup music to Selby's unforgettable convocation speech

The speech is tailor made for going viral and, indeed, the Youtube footage of the moving address had gotten 275,000 views just two days after it was posted by user Andy Blanton.

‘If you want to change the world, you're at Georgia Tech, you can do that! If you want to build the Iron Man suit, you're at Georgia Tech—you can do that! If you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a badass, we're at Georgia Tech—we can do that,’ he screamed. ‘I AM DOING THAT!’

Inspired: 'If you wanna build the Iron Man suit, you're at Georgia Tech,' he yelled, 'YOU CAN DO THAT!'

Case in point: 'If you wanna play theme music during your convocation speech like a badass, we're at Georgia Tech! We can do that! I AM DOING THAT!'

With that bit of self-reference, Selby’s unforgettable opus was nearly complete.

The incoming freshman, all of them donning the school’s traditional yellow beanie, gave a brief and slightly confused ovation.

'Congratulations,' he smirked before marching off the stage. 'Brace yourselves for a hell of a ride on your way to becoming a hell of an engineer.'

Applause: The yellow beanie-wearing crowd of future engineers first gave confused, nervous applause, but eventually gave Selby the standing ovation he deserved

Selby’s popularity has quickly skyrocketed since his speech hit Youtube.

He’s even a caught the eye of some female fans who see great potential in the humorous and brainy sophomore.

A contributor to the blog The Frisky even wrote Selby an open love letter.

‘Dear Nick,’ writes Julie Gerstein. ‘your speech was so powerful…that I now feel prepared to take on a new challenge: making you my boyfriend so hard.’

‘I would like to stand on some giant shoulders with you,’ she went on. ‘Is that cool?’

Selby’s fandom has spread beyond bloggers, as well.

Even ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer has confessed an appreciation for the future engineer.

However, the instant celebrity appears to have a serious girlfriend.

‘Diane Sawyer just gave Nick a shout out, so I feel inadequate’ tweeted Katie Giel, who appears on both his Facebook page and her own looking quite cozy with Selby. ‘I feel like I'm dating a celebrity.’

Protective: 'I can't read these YouTube comments. I'm way too defensive of Nick,' Giel tweeted

Insecure? 'Diane Sawyer just gave Nick a shout out, so I feel inadequate' Giel joked on Twitter as her boyfriend's internet celebrity ballooned Tuesday
