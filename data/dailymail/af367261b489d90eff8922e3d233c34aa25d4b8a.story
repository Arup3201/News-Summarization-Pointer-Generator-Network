Probe: HSBC is alleged to have helped wealthy customes hide their cash and assets from the government to avoid paying their full tax bills

HSBC helped 7,000 wealthy Britons avoid millions of pounds in tax using secret 'black' accounts based in Switzerland, it was alleged today. 

Britain's biggest bank used its Swiss private banking arm to help their super-rich clients evade tax and also advised them how to stay one step ahead of UK tax law. 

It was revealed after a whistleblower leaked details of 30,000 accounts holding £78billion between 2005 and 2007, with a quarter said to be held by Britons.

Hollywood stars, royalty, Europe's richest families as well as relatives of dictators and people implicated in cases of African corruption are also said to held an account to help them evade tax.

In one example, HSBC's Swiss bankers were prepared to help Emmanuel Shallop - a man later convicted of dealing in blood diamonds. 

Offshore accounts are not illegal but they are often used as a way of hiding earnings from HM Revenue and Customs. However, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is illegal.

But even though 1,100 people who had not paid what they should have done were identified,  five years later only one person has been prosecuted.

HSBC has today admitted wrongdoing in Switzerland but said that it has now 'fundamentally changed' since then.

Claims the bank routinely used its Swiss operations to help clients shield their true value from the taxman were revealed by a BBC Panorama investigation, which found:

Panorama will air on BBC1 tonight and has seen thousands of leaked accounts showing how bankers helped clients – nearly 7,000 of them British – to avoid taxes.

Some account details were stolen by a computer hacker in 2007 and were presented to HMRC in 2010.

The Tories and Lib Dems seized on the revelation to question the role of Ed Balls, who was City Minister from May 2006 to June 2007. 

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Balls and Ed Miliband, a former Treasury adviser, should 'admit that they let the banks run riot on their watch'.

Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said Panorama 'throws a spotlight on the opportunities for tax evasion on the eve of the financial crash in 2007'. 

He added: 'It is for HSBC to explain what they did to ensure their clients complied with the tax law. But it is for the City Minister in years up to 2007, Ed Balls, to make an urgent statement about what he knew about all this and why the then government allowed tax avoidance and evasion to take place on such a scale. 

'Since 2010 we have closed many of the loopholes exposed in this report and specifically taken action to get back money lost in Swiss Bank Accounts.' 

However, Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves insisted revelations about HSBC did not emerge until 2010, so it was not something that Mr Balls could have taken action on. 

Shadow financial secretary to the treasury Cathy Jamieson said: 'HMRC were made fully aware of these practices back in 2010. There are serious questions for the Chancellor to answer about why just one person out of over a thousand have been prosecuted in five years.

'And why the Government's Swiss tax deal has been such an embarrassing flop, raising a fraction of the amounts initially boasted of by ministers.'

'Tax avoidance and evasion harms every taxpayer in Britain, and undermines public services like the NHS.' 

The banking documents which form the expose have now become the biggest banking leak in history, The Guardian reported.

Among them are the revelations HSBC's Swiss bank allowed its clients to withdraw bricks of cash, allowed clients to conceal undeclared 'black accounts' and gave accounts to criminals and corrupt businessmen. 

The Tories and Lib Dems said the revelations raised questions about the role of Labour's Ed Balls, who was City Minister from May 2006 to June 2007

The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative Peer and appointed to the government

HMRC says that £135million in tax, interest and penalties has now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland.

HSBC claims that since the documents were leaked, it has radically overhauled its private banking business and reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70 per cent since 2007. 

The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative Peer and appointed to the government.

Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said Panorama 'throws a spotlight on the opportunities for tax evasion on the eve of the financial crash in 2007'

Lord Green was made a Minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a Minister of Trade and Investment until 2013.

Lord Green told Panorama: 'As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present.'

But Panorama spoke to a whistleblower who said HSBC had still failed to implement changes when she worked there in 2013.  

Sue Shelley, who was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg, said: 'The verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice.'

She was sacked after raising concerns and an unfair dismissal tribunal ruled in her favour.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, says they still need to be much tougher with those who seek to avoid tax.

She said: 'I just don't think the tax authorities have been strong enough, assertive enough, tough enough in securing for the taxpayer the monies that are due.'

Mrs Hodge accepted that many of the activities took place while Labour was in power.

'I think that times have changed and we have to move on. You have to remember in times past public finances were not under such tension, there weren't so many demands on them, you didn't have the deficit.'

She said former trade minister Lord Green, who previously ran HSBC, faced 'serious questions'.

'Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices,' Mrs Hodge said. 'Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer.'
