Senators, beware. There's a new majority leader in town come January, and he's not afraid of long work weeks and late nights, if that's what it takes to avoid another 'do-nothing' Congress.

Long gone are the days of political showdowns that hold up critical bills and common sense legislation, says the incoming Senate leader, Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell.

'It was not about legislation. It had nothing to do with an outcome. The Senate basically didn’t do squat for years,' he told the New York Times, chastising his Democratic predecessor Harry Reid. 'I don’t think most members of the Senate wanted it run that way.'

Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,  pictured here during an interview at the U.S. Capitol last week, has vowed not to run the upper chamber like his predecessor, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid. The previous way of doing business 'was designed to make us walk the plank. It had nothing to do with getting a legislative outcome,' he said.

But it's not just Democrats who will have to get in line, McConnell says. 

His own caucus will have to shed its reputation as the party of 'no' if the GOP is to successfully move its agenda and retain its position of authority.

'One of my challenges is to try to convince some of my members that passing an appropriations bill is a good thing, not a bad thing,' he told the Times.

'Many of my members are not used to voting for appropriations bills. But if we are going to pursue our agenda to push back against the bureaucratic overreach seemingly on steroids for the last five or six years, we need to put appropriations bills on the president’s desk and make him make a choice,' he said.

Republicans will also have to play follow the leader more often now that they're in the majority, McConnell said, and stop holding up the legislative process until they can bend it to their will.

'There are two kinds of people in politics,' McConnell said. 'Those who want to make a point and those who want to make a difference.

'All of us from time to time make a point,' he noted. 'But it is time now to make a difference.'

Perceptions of the 113th Congress as the do-nothing legislature aren't wrong. 

According to an analysis of congressional data conducted by the Associated Press, with just over 200 bills signed into law, the current Congress was the least productive body since the one that concluded in 1948.

Labeled by then-President Harry Truman as the 'do-nothing Congress,' that legislature oversaw the creation of 900 laws.

'We have a president who was facing a headwind, Republicans opposing him in Congress and a decline in popularity. Republicans saw no reason to give us any legislative help,' Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, his party's No. 2 leader, told the Associated Press. 

The conservative and libertarian wings of the Republican Party have argued regularly over the past two years that given the choice between no new laws and laws that advance Democratic interests, including new regulatory guidelines and rules they perceive as restricting Americans' rights and freedoms, the fewer laws the better.

But if Republicans continue to threaten government shutdowns when they don't get their way and constantly play the role of contrarian, the party risks losing its majorities in both the House and the Senate - and the office of the president in 2016. Americans may decide they want a united, functional government, regardless of what type of laws it produces.

McConnell will have to walk a fine line between keeping the upper chamber on task and stifling debate, however. 

To that end, he's promised several times since the November elections that catapulted the GOP into power that he will allow a free-flowing discussion on the Senate floor, unlike previous leader Reid, who would often prohibit amendments he didn't like from undergoing debate.

He's also committed to keeping the Senate in session longer by reestablishing a five-day work week that forces members to stick around on Friday instead of starting their weekend early. 

'It will more chaotic, there will probably be later nights,' McConnell told the Times. 'The goal is to let the Senate express its views.'

The strategy is meant to pacify both progressive and conservative firebrands and give them ample opportunity to make their views known without sending the Senate into overtime, as it did earlier this month when right-wing Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee took to the floor on a Friday evening to demand a vote on President Barack Obama's immigration orders.

Cruz says they were promised a vote before the Senate adjourned for the weekend but did not receive it. The move infuriated Reid, and he left the Senate in session through Saturday out of spite and used the time to force through presidential nominees whose confirmations had been stalled.

At a closed-door party luncheon the following week during the Senate's final days in session before closing up shop for the holidays, Cruz begged pardon from fellow Republicans whose weekends he'd just ruined.

'Yes, the senator acknowledged that a number of his colleagues had to unexpectedly change their weekend plans, and he apologized to them for inconveniencing their personal schedules. That was not his intention,' Cruz's spokeswoman Catherine Frazier confirmed to Politico.

'His intention was to secure a vote on President Obama’s illegal executive amnesty, and to use every procedural means to do so,' she explained.

McConnell refused to comment to reporters on the events that transpired but made it clear he wouldn't manage the Senate the way Democrats did in the previous eight years.

The most recent legislative session was all about 'how many times did we have the point of the week?' he told the Associated Press. 

'It was designed to make us walk the plank. It had nothing to do with getting a legislative outcome.'

Finally in the seat of power, McConnell is ready to get down to business on Jan. 5 when the new Congress convenes, and he and House Speaker John Boehner already have a list of legislative priorities ironed out for the first six weeks.

'I have studied this job and reached my own conclusions about how it ought to be done,' McConnell told the Times. 'It has been a long wait.'

First up is legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline. 

A similar effort to authorize the final section of the transnational oil transportation system died in the Senate earlier this month, even though it had the support of 14 Democratic senators in addition to the chamber's 45 Republicans, and the GOP believes that next year it will have enough votes to send a bill to the president's desk.

Also atop of the to-do list is passing legislation to repeal Obamacare. While the bill will likely receive widespread support in both legislative bodies, it has no chance of becoming law, as the president has already said he will issue a rare veto to keep his signature law in place.

Republicans may find more success in taking a piecemeal approach to dismantling and reforming the health care law, particularly if they focus on areas that Democrats have also levied complaints at. McConnell has indicated that if their preferred approach to taking down Obamacare fails, they'll take that tact.

The House and Senate also likely to take up bills that introduce changes to the tax code, promote trade and boost infrastructure spending at the request of the president, who has argued that he'll be more likely to work with Congress if they're make a good faith effort to work with him.
