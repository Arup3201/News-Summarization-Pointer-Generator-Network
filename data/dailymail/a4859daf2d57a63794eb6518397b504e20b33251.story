Port Vale have confirmed the appointment of caretaker manager Rob Page on a full-time basis.

The former Wales international had been placed in temporary charge since the departure of Micky Adams in September, but will now remain in control at least until the end of the season.

Since taking the reigns at Vale Park, the 40-year-old has overseen impressive wins over Barnsley, Yeovil and Leyton Orient.

Page said on the club's website: 'I am really pleased. I had a conversation with the chairman and he has offered me the opportunity to manage the club, which I am very grateful for.

Rob Page applauds his Port Vale side from the touchline earlier in October and has now been given the full-time managerial job at Vale Park on a full-time basis following a successful caretaker stint

Appointed September 18 

League Two: Won 3; Drawn 2; Lost 2

JP Trophy: Won 0; Drawn 0; Lost 1 

'I think the difference in the approach to games, especially at home, is there for everyone to see and long may it continue.

'This is a proud moment for myself and I would like to thank the fans and players for their support, which will continue to be important in the future.'

Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite added: 'Having stepped up under difficult circumstances, I am pleased with the way in which Rob has implemented an attractive style of play and turned around the club's home form.

'It has been a difficult few months but I believe this signals the start of a new era at the club and that this is the best possible outcome for the fans, players and staff.

'Rob has stepped up to the mark and hopefully our form will continue to go from strength to strength under his leadership.'
