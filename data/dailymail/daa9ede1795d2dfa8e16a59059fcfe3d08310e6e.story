Pictured on his eighth birthday, Kyle was described as a 'cheeky', popular boy

An eight-year-old boy died in front of his brother after he was involved in a crash with a mobile crane as he cycled along a busy road.

Kyle Allan's mother today said he died while playing hide and seek in Aberdeen with his brother and a friend.

He was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary after last night's accident, but later died from his injuries.

His mother, Kelly, described her son as 'cheeky' as she paid tribute to her son.

She said: 'He was a cheeky, loving boy and
was so popular at school and among his friends.

'He was such a kind boy as well - if 
he saw anybody getting hurt he would go over and do all he could to help
- he was that sort of kid.

'It's hard for everyone. His sister is
his twin and she's finding it really hard to come to terms with, she 
just doesn't understand what's happened, she's innocent to it all.'

Mrs Allan added that first heard about the tragedy yesterday evening when his seven-year-old brother Ryan ran home in hysterics, shouting that Kyle had been hit by a crane.

She said the two boys had been playing
hide and seek with another friend and Kyle was trying to flee on his bike 
when he went down a hill, but couldn't stop and shot onto the main road 
and under the crane.

Mrs Kelly added: 'It's just a tragic 
accident - nobody's blaming the driver because I know what it's like 
coming along that road, there's no way he would have been able to stop 
in time.

The boy's mangled bike can be seen at the side of the Great Northern Road close to where the collision happened

'But I don't know why he was so close to the main road anyway. He's never been there before, he 
normally just goes around on his bike in this residential area and 
nowhere near the main road.'

Diane Mitchell said: 'I was at the scene when it happened. My heart goes out to his family especially his little brother who witnessed it.'

Hours before the accident one Facebook user said she had to suddenly brake near the scene of the crash because three children were weaving in and out of traffic on bikes.

Mandy McGill said: 'I drove along there earlier. There were three young boys on their bikes, aged between six and eight.

'They were dodging in and out of the traffic beside the roadworks. My heart was in my mouth when I saw them.'

It is believed he was playing hide and seek with his brother and a friend when he was killed

As well as his brother Ryan, Kyle has a twin sister called Morgan and a two-year-old brother Jack.

His grandfather James Kinnaird said: 'Today was the worst day in my life. My grandson Kyle Allan was knocked down and killed by a crane driver on Great Northern Road at 7.30pm.

'RIP Kyle from your Grandda xxx.'

Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash which happened on Tuesday evening on the Great Northern Road in Aberdeen, Scotland.

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'The eight-year-old boy was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and he has sadly succumbed to his injuries.'
