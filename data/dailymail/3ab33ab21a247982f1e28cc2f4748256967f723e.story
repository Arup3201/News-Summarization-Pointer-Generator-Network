For many of us, a car journey means one inevitable thing – at some point you’ll have a row with the other occupants. And it seems that just about anything can set us off.

Now a survey has revealed the biggest causes of in-car friction and, perhaps unsurprisingly, rows over which route to take top the list.

Driving too fast, not asking for directions when lost and children being too noisy are next on the list, compiled by the AA and Populus.

Argument: A survey has revealed the biggest causes of in-car friction and, perhaps unsurprisingly, rows over which route to take top the list (file picture)

The survey, based on responses from more than 23,000 AA members, found that two in three people argue in the car, with those aged 18 to 24 more likely to row than the over-65s.

People in Northern Ireland get hottest under the collar while in the car, with the least-argumentative car occupants being those from south-west England.

Disputes about knowing the best route were the top cause of argument for all age groups, with driving too fast being the second-biggest cause for all but the 35-44s who were more concerned about noisy children.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Long journeys often get fraught at times. The key thing is taking time to prepare well for the journey which should help keep arguments at bay.’
