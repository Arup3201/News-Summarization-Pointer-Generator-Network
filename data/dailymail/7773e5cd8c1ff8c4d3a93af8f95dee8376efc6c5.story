Shocking footage has emerged of a violent fight involving co-workers at a Waffle House which takes a particularly nasty turn for the worse when one woman starts to pull out her co-workers hair.

The barbaric behavior occurred at a restaurant in Augusta, Georgia.

The video, which appears to have been shot on a customerâ€™s smartphone, show two separate fights starting almost simultaneously.

One waitress is sits on her opponents back pulling out handfuls of her hair and at one point she even throws a punch at the back of the woman's head

Shocking footage has emerged of not one but two fights taking place simultaneously at a Waffle House in Augusta, Georgia

In the right corner of the video two waitresses dressed in blue engage in arm to arm combat, while a man makes a weak-willed effort to break it up.

Meanwhile to the left of the picture another fight is taking place between a larger women wearing yellow and a woman in a green t-shirt. This bout is more of a wrestling match than boxing and the larger lady users her extra weight to gain an all-important advantage.

At one point the camera is focused on the wrestling match, until a primal howl of anguish emanating from the other fight attracts the attention of the amateur cameraman.

The camera quickly shifts to the two ladies fighting on the right, one waitress is now sitting on her opponents back and pulling out handfuls of her hair. At one point she even throws a punch at the back of the woman's head.

No explanation is given for what the women are fighting over but I would image that their bosses at Waffle House won't be very impressed when they see what goes on at the restaurant.

At the beginning of the video you can clearly see the two women who seconds later will be scraping on the floor
