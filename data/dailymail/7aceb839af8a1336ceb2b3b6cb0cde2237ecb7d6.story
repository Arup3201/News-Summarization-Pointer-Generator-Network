Are residents of Providence, Rhode Island, and New Bedford, Massachusetts, going to hell?Â 

The American Bible Society suggests so, or at least purgatory if they don't start reading the Bible quick-smart.

The organization quizzed citizens nationwide to find the most and least 'Bible-minded' cities in the United States, and while the people of Providence and New Bedford were the most skeptical of the holy story, missionaries who visit Chattanooga, Tennessee, will be preaching to the converted.

With a population of 171,000, the southern city is the most Bible-minded in the country, with the majority of its citizens reading the Bible regularly outside of church and believing the centuries-old book is accurate.

Chattanooga overtook Knoxville, Tennessee, in 2013, in the society's second consecutive study into the nation's Godliness.

Unsurprisingly, the Midwest and the South dominated the most Bible-minded areas, with Birmingham, Alabama taking second spot followed by Lynchburg, Virginia; Springfield, Montana and Shreveport, Louisiana. Little Rock, Arkansas and Jackson, Mississippi also made the top 10.

What was surprising was New York City's absence from the 10 least Bible-minded cities rank for 2013.

Bible: Surprisingly, New York City came outside the top 10 least Bible-minded cities - 11th or 89th most Bible-minded - possibly because of its strong Orthodox Jewish population. The study didn't ask respondents to specify what they consider the 'Bible'

While the East Coast certainly represented, the Big Apple came in just outside - 11th least or 89th most Bible-minded - possibly because of its strong Orthodox Jewish population. The study didn't ask respondents to specify what they consider the 'Bible,' and the second question asked was: 'How many times do you read the bible outside of church or a synagogue?'

Behind Providence and New Bedford on the least Godly ranking came Albany, New York; Boston, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Phoenix, Arizona and Portland, Maine also made the list.

Researchers said they discovered an inverse relationship between population size and Bible friendliness.

People in smaller cities were more likely to be church-going folk, they found.

Of the top 25 Bible-minded markets, only three have a population of greater than 1 million households, according to the study. Those were Charlotte, North Carolina, Nashville, Tennessee, and Dallas, Texas.

'An analysis of interaction with and views of the Bible continues to help us evaluate the Bible landscape in America,' American Bible Society spokesman Geoffrey Morin said.

'To help people engage with the [Bible], we need to understand where people are starting from.'
