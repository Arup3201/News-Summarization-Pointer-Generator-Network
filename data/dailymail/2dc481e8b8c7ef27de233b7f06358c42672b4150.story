Six months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer, Good Morning America presenter Amy Robach celebrated online the completion of her chemotherapy treatments.

The 41-year-old veteran TV host tweeted to her followers Thursday: 'Today is my final round of chemotherapy. I wanted to share this moment with you to encourage anyone facing this battle.'

The message was accompanied by a collage of photographs from the past six months depicting Robach counting down with her fingers the number of remaining chemo sessions.

A short time later, Robach shared another picture with her 51,000 Twitter followers featuring her front door plastered with colorful drawings and encouraging messages from her large family congratulating her on the medical milestone.

'This was sight for sore eyes... The best welcome home ever,' Robach wrote, adding the hashtag '#nomorechemo#Â 

Robach has taken over the anchor job following the sudden departure of Josh Elliott in late March.

Fighter: Amy Robach, pictured left with fellow GMA anchor Lara Spencer, is turning to work to distract her from her chemotherapy treatments following her breast cancer diagnosis last year

'Amy considers getting up every morning 
and having something to look forward to a gift,' a source told People magazine earlier this month. 'It's a much needed 
distraction from her treatment.'

Robach, a mother to two young girls and a step-mother to three boys, was diagnosed with breast cancer last October after undergoing a mammogram for Good Morning America.

She discovered she had a
 malignant tumor in her right breast, and it was only after she had a double mastectomy that doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some 
abnormal cells in the left breast.

After
 the surgery, it also became clear that the disease had spread to her 
sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the magic bullet.

Shock: She was diagnosed with cancer after undergoing an on-air mammogram last October

But amid the treatments, she has stayed positive by focusing on her work.

'Feeling like I have a purpose is very 
helpful,' she told the magazine.

'Mentally I feel stronger, knowing I'm still me. I 
still have my job. My life isn't just cancer, so it's very important for
 me to try and get my butt up.'

She returned to the air in December and after cutting her hair short on air, she went to Sochi to cover the Olympics while undergoing chemo.

She told the magazine that she takes naps to keep up but that it can sometimes takes several days 'to get my mojo back'.

Preparation: She was filmed chopping off her locks as she started undergoing chemotherapy

Strong: Robach, showing off her new hair, has barely missed a day from work, sources have said

With her final chemo treatment now behind her, Robach will undergo breast reconstruction later this spring.

Due to the location and size of the tumors, Robach's surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that are placed where the removed breasts once were.

They will stay in place behind the chest muscle for a few months in an effort to stretch it out before implants are put in during a second surgery.
