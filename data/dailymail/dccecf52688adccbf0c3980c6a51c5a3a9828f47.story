David Cameron is preparing to issue a personal apologise to the Queen after he was caught boasting she had ‘purred down the line’ when he called to tell her Scotland had rejected independence.

The Prime Minister was said to be ‘deeply embarrassed’ last night after he was inadvertently caught on camera discussing the Queen’s reaction to last week’s referendum.

His comments were blasted by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who led the campaign for independence, as 'absolutely pathetic'.

In an extraordinary sequence, David Cameron was today heard talking about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the vote

Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state

He told BBC Scotland: 'David Cameron has been prime minister for four years and he hasn't learned basic civility on not gossiping about what Her Majesty The Queen thinks, or doesn't think, to Michael Bloomberg, or anyone else for that matter.

'That's absolutely pathetic and he should hang his head in shame.'

Mr Cameron is in New York for talks at the United Nations on tackling the rise of ISIS extremists.

But sources indicated the Prime Minister will issue a private apology to Her Majesty over what experts described as an ‘extraordinary breach of protocol’. 

apparently said she had ‘purred down the line’ when she was told Scots had voted by 55 per cent to 45 to remain part of the UK.

Audio experts at the BBC, who analysed the footage, claim he then said: ‘I have never heard someone tear up like that.’ 

Other listeners were divided, with some saying Mr Cameron had described the Queen as seeming ‘happy’ and ‘grateful’.

The astonishing slip came as he chatted with billionaire US media mogul Michael Bloomberg at a trade event in New York yesterday. Mr Cameron appeared to be unaware that his conversation with the former New York mayor was being picked up by the microphone of a camera, which was filming the two men walking into the meeting.

Mr Cameron, smiling broadly, can be heard saying: ‘The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying, “Your Majesty, it is all right, it’s OK.” That was something. That’s relief. She purred down the line.’

The Prime Minister then seems to say: ‘I’ve never, I’ve never heard someone tear up like that ... grateful.’

However, other listeners claimed he had said ‘cheer up’.

His comments are embarrassing for the Queen, who stuck scrupulously to her constitutional position of not intervening in politics during the referendum campaign.

The closest she came to a comment was when she urged voters to ‘think carefully’ before casting their ballots – interpreted by some as support for a No vote.

Downing Street last night declined to comment on what it described as a ‘private conversation’ with Mr Bloomberg.

The 38-second piece of footage was put out on a pool basis to newscasters, but Mr Cameron’s unguarded remarks were initially picked up by Sky News.

In the most astonishing remark, Mr Cameron was heard to claim that The Queen 'purred down the line'

Continuing the bizarre train of thought, the Prime Minister claimed pollsters had given him stomach ulcers

In the video recording, David Cameron can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: 

'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something....

'She purred down the line...

'But it should never have been that close.

'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt…

'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through.

'It was very nervous moments.'

By yesterday evening, #purringqueen was trending on Twitter after the report went viral.

In an apparent rebuke, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We would never comment on a private conversation between Her Majesty and the Prime Minister.’

But the Queen’s former press secretary, Dickie Arbiter, described Mr Cameron’s blunder as an astonishing breach of protocol.

He said: ‘I find it extraordinary that a Prime Minister, a head of government, could refer in such a casual way to a conversation he has had with the head of state.

‘This is compounded by the fact that the person to whom he is speaking was, to all intents and purposes, a complete stranger.

‘The Queen’s conversation with her prime ministers are entirely confidential for a very good reason.

‘It is the cornerstone of their relationship and the basis on which she can exert her constitutional right to advise, encourage and warn. You simply can’t afford to have such a casual attitude to this when you are Prime Minister.

‘He, of all people, should have been aware of the cameras and that they could pick his conversation up. Even Tony Blair, for all his bluster, has always kept schtum about the Queen.’

Former Labour defence minister Kevan Jones said Mr Cameron’s slip betrayed an ‘arrogant and disrespectful’ attitude.

He added: ‘The Queen worked enormously hard to maintain her neutrality during the referendum campaign despite a great deal of pressure to speak out. I am sure the Palace will be mortified that her private thoughts have now been blurted out by her own Prime Minister.’

Mr Cameron provoked anger in 2011 when he revealed to MPs that Prince William had personally lobbied against cuts to Britain’s air-sea rescue capability.

But his latest slip is likely to cause much graver offence at the Palace.

It could also spark anger among pro-independence Scots.

The blunder came after Mr Bloomberg congratulated Mr Cameron over the outcome of the referendum. The first part of the Prime Minister’s response is inaudible, but he then says: ‘It should never have been that close.

‘It wasn’t in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt…’ He is then heard hitting out at the pollsters, who sparked panic in Westminster by briefly suggesting the Yes campaign was on course to win.

The comments will fuel concerns among Tory MPs that Mr Cameron panicked and offered major concessions to Scotland on the basis of one or two rogue polls.

Speaking about his own reaction to the Scottish No vote, Mr Cameron told NBC News: ‘I was extremely nervous and worried because I’m a passionate believer in the United Kingdom. I represent an English constituency.

‘I’m English ... I’m also British, and I care massively about the potential break-up of our country.’

The extraordinary remarks were picked up as Mr Cameron went on a walkabout at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York, with the city's former mayor Michael Bloomberg

Mr Cameron also vowed to 'sue' polling companies who suggested the Yes campaign was ahead in the referendum campaign, claiming the worry had given him 'stomach ulcers'

Late on Saturday September 6, details of a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times emerged, putting Yes on 51 per cent and No on 49 per cent
