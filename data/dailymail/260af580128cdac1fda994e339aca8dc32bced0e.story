Teenagers who play violent computer games such as Grand Theft Auto are more likely to drink, smoke and have unprotected sex, psychologists have found.

Games that glorify risky behaviour can encourage adolescents to become more rebellious and seek out thrills themselves, according to a new study.

Scientists tracked 5,000 American teenagers for four years, and found a distinct correlation between the frequency that they played violent games and their behaviour.

They discovered that those who often played adult-rated games were more likely to smoke, drink and become aggressive.

The teenagers, who were aged 13 and ten months on average when the experiment started, were also more likely to go on, within four years, to display delinquent behaviour such as petty theft, starting fights or running away from home.

Those who played violent games were also more likely to have first had sex at a younger age, more likely to have caught a sexually transmitted disease, and more likely to have had unprotected sex.

The changes in behaviour, which were similar for boys and girls, increased in magnitude over time, the scientists found.

Separate research published yesterday by Oxford University suggests that playing video games for less than an hour a day can lead to children becoming better adjusted.

That study, published in the journal Pediatrics - which did not differentiate violent and non-violent games - found that young people who indulged in a little video game-playing were more sociable and more satisfied than those who had never played or who used video games for three hours or more.

The study involved nearly 5,000 young people, half male and half female, drawn from a nationally representative study of UK households.

Research Dr Andrew Przybylski said: 'These results support recent laboratory-based experiments that have identified the downsides to playing electronic games.

However, high levels of video game-playing appear to be only weakly linked to children's behavioural problems in the real world.'

Grand Theft Auto, a phenomenally successful game now in its fifth edition, involves stealing cars and driving at excessive speeds to evade police cars, with extra points for knocking over innocent bystanders or committing other crimes.

Other violent games linked by the scientists to deviant behaviour include Manhunt - a psychological horror video game - and Spiderman 2, in which a comic-book superhero beats up villains.

The scientists, from Dartmouth College in the US, said the violent characters in the video games appear to affect how adolescents think of themselves, with consequences for their alter ego in the real world.

The study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, follows a 2012 Dartmouth study that suggested that such video games may lead teens to drive recklessly and drink and drive.

Professor James Sargent, who worked on the study, said: ‘Up to now, studies of video games have focused primarily on their effects on aggression and violent behaviours.

‘This study is important because it is the first to suggest that possible effects of violent video games go well beyond violence to apply to substance use, risky driving and risk-taking sexual behaviour.’

His colleague Professor Jay Hull, quoting a 1960s American actor, said: ‘With respect to playing deviant video game characters, we feel it best to follow the admonition of Kurt Vonnegut in Mother Night: “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”’

The authors suggested that changes in behaviour following protracted game play was down to alterations in the users’ personality, attitudes and values, making them more rebellious and thrill seeking.

They wrote: ‘Across a wide variety of measures, mature-rated risk-glorifying gameplay was associated with deviant adolescent risk behaviour including excessive alcohol use, cigarette smoking, aggression, delinquency, and risky sex.

The authors added: ‘Character-based video games provide an opportunity to practice being someone else. As a result, the behavioural consequences of playing such games are potentially much broader than the specific kinds of behaviours enacted in the game.’

Playing video games is not necessary all bad, however.

Separate research published yesterday by Oxford University suggests that playing video games for less than an hour a day can lead to children becoming better adjusted.

That study, published in the journal Pediatrics - which did not differentiate violent and non-violent games - found that young people who indulged in a little video game-playing were more sociable and more satisfied with their lives compared with those who had never played or who used video games for three hours or more.
