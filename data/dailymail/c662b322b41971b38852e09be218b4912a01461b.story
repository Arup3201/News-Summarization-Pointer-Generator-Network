On trial: Radovan Karadzic appeared relaxed as he gave a 90-minute statement to defend himself against charges of genocide and war crimes

Former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic claimed at his genocide trial yesterday that he was a ‘mild’ and ‘tolerant’ man, who sought peace and reduced the ‘suffering of all civilians’.

The statement met with cries of outrage from survivors of the Bosnian war packed into the public gallery at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

Some wept at what they branded the ‘cruel, empty’ words of the man they blame for masterminding the ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of Muslims in the 1990s.

A relaxed-looking  Karadzic, 67, opened his defence by insisting he had done ‘everything within human power’ to avoid the war, adding: ‘Instead of being accused of the events in our war, I should be rewarded for all the good things I have done.’

Karadzic was arrested in Serbia in 2008 after 13 years living in disguise as a new age health guru.

He denies blame for atrocities including the 1995 Srebrenica massacre when more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were executed.

Karadzic told judges he was a reluctant player in the break-up of Yugoslavia, adding that before the war many of his friends were Muslims.

Until his arrest in 2008, Karadzic
had been one of the most wanted men in the world, accused of 
orchestrating the murders of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats 
during a war that ultimately claimed the lives of an estimated 100,000 
people between 1992 and 1995.

He is also being prosecuted for his role in the shelling and 44-month siege of Sarajevo which left 12,000 civilians dead and forced thousands to eat 
grass to survive, and the use of 284 UN peacekeepers as human shields in
May and June 1995.

As Supreme Commander of the 
Bosnian Serb armed forces and President of the National Security Council
of the Republika Srpska, prosecutors have claimed Karadzic was ultimately responsible for numerous massacres and war crimes carried out by his army.

Current charges include:

Karadzic was acquitted over the following massacres carried out by the Republika Srpska army after prosecutors failed to provide enough evidence to support claims that he was directly responsible.

But the former psychologist and poet,
told judges he was a 'physician and literary man' who was a reluctant 
player in the violent breakup of Yugoslavia.

He said Muslims had faked the 
circumstances of two shellings of a marketplace in the Bosnian capital 
Sarajevo during a siege by Serb forces where more than 100 people were 
killed.

'Sarajevo is my city, and any story that we would shell Sarajevo without
any reason is untrue,' he said, reiterating long-standing allegations 
by the Serb side which have already been refuted by the Hague tribunal 
in an earlier case.

Karadzic said Sarajevo was his adopted home and that 'every shell that fell on Sarajevo hurt me personally.'

Branding the first market shelling a 'shameless orchestration', he added: 'Obviously some people got killed by that explosion but we also saw mannequins being thrown onto trucks creating this show for the world.'

Leaning forward in his chair, he emphasised points with jabs of his right hand and paused occasionally to adjust his rimless glasses.

He said the first marketplace 
shelling, in February 1994, in which 68 people were killed and 144 were 
injured, had been orchestrated, as was a second a few days later.

Prosecutors have painted a starkly 
different picture of Karadzic during months of witness testimony, 
portraying him as a political leader who masterminded Serb atrocities 
throughout the war.

Karadzic, 67, denied that portrait of him.

The
statement was not made under oath, meaning Karadzic could not be 
cross-examined by prosecutors but will later be permitted to 
cross-examine witnesses himself.

His speech coincided with a historic moment for the tribunal as one of the last of the tribunal's 161 indicted suspects to face justice as his trial gets under way in a neighbouring courtroom.

Goran Hadzic, a former leader of 
rebel Serbs in Croatia, was arrested last year in northern Serbia after 
more than seven years on the run and pleaded not guilty to charges of 
murdering hundreds of Croats and expelling tens of thousands more.

But all eyes were on Karadzic today 
as he tried to dodge claims that he masterminded some of the most 
horrific wartime atrocities since the Second World War.

Karadzic was arrested in 2008 on a bus in Belgrade after he had been on the run for almost 13 years.

He
had been living in disguise as a new age health guru. The trained 
psychiatrist worked for a private clinic, posing as a specialist in 
alternative medicine under the assumed name of Dragan Dabic.

The Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal began trying its last suspect today, opening the final chapter for an institution that has broken new ground in the investigation of conflicts and paved the way for a permanent global war crimes court.

Goran Hadzic (pictured), the last of 161 suspects still alive and at large after the wars that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia, was arrested last year and is accused of murder, torture and forcible deportation at the very outset of those wars.

Prosecutors say Hadzic, president of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina from 1992-94, was responsible for killings and forced deportations of minority ethnic Croats from the region after the Croatian government in Zagreb broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991.

Already sentenced in his absence to a total of 40 years in prison by Croatian courts in the mid-1990s, Hadzic was finally detained by Serbian authorities in 2011.

leader of armies but a bedraggled and washed-up pensioner with a bushy 
white beard down to his chest.

His trial began at the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in October the following year.

But he boycotted the start of his 
trial in October 2009 saying he had not been given enough time to 
prepare. The first witness did not testify until April 2010 and 
prosecutors rested their case on May 25 this year.

Just
over a month later, judges acquitted Karadzic of one count of genocide,
saying prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to establish that a
campaign of murder and persecution early in the Bosnian War amounted to
genocide. Prosecutors have appealed the acquittal.

Karadzic still faces 10 more charges, including one genocide count relating to the Srebrenica massacre.

Karadzic
is one of a trio of architects of the Balkan wars brought to trial in 
The Hague for wars among the successor countries and the peoples of 
multi-ethnic Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1999, in which well over 
100,000 people were killed and millions were displaced.

His
wartime military chief, General Ratko Mladic, went on trial this year, 
facing the same charges, and former Yugoslav and Serbian president 
Slobodan Milosevic died in 2006 before the end of his trial.

For years it seemed 
that the main suspects would stay out of the tribunal's reach, until 
political changes in the countries of southeastern Europe made it ever 
more difficult for suspects to hide. In July, Serbia announced it was 
investigating 13 people on suspicion of helping war criminals evade 
justice.

Both men face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.

After being cleared of the first genocide charge in June, he now faces the second relating to the deaths of more than 7,000 Bosniak (Bosnian 
Muslim) men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995. It was the worst atrocity in
Europe since the end of World War II.

He is also being prosecuted over the 44-month siege of Sarajevo, in which more than 12,000 civilians died.

The trial continues.

Humble beginnings: Radovan Karadzic was born in a stable in Savnik, Montenegro in 1945

Poet, psychologist and relentless Serb patriot, Radovan Karadzic was born in a stable in Savnik, Montenegro in 1945.

His father, Vuk, was in jail during much of his childhood.

Vuk
had been a member of the Chetniks, the Serb nationalist guerillas who 
fought for the Allies against both Nazi occupiers and communist 
partisans in the Second World War.

Karadzic's mother Jovanka has described her son as loyal, serious and
a hard worker, who used to help her in the home and in the field.

He was respectful towards the elderly and helped his school friends with their homework.

In 1960, Karadzic moved to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, where he 
graduated as a doctor and became a psychologist in a city hospital.

It
was in Sarajevo that Karadzic met his wife, Ljiljana. But he also 
became a poet and fell under the influence of the Serb nationalist 
writer Dobrica Cosic, who encouraged him to go into politics.

Karadzic,
who was also an enthusiastic player of a single-string Serbian 
instrument known as the 'gusle', became head of the Bosnian Serb 
Democratic Party in 1989.

The flamboyant, bouffant-haired leader showed few signs of the hatred
to come. He regularly played high-stakes poker with his Muslim and 
Croat neighbours.

But amid the chaos and violence of Yugoslavia's 
disintegration, his assertion of 'historic Serbian rights' allegedly led to 
appalling slaughter.
