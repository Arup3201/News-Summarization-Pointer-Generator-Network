Our love affair with hipster foods such as prosecco, pulled pork and pancetta is coming to an end as more and more of us get fed up of hearing about them.

Ultimate menu brags such as sea bass, kale, slow roast meat  and couscous are also getting short shrift, although Gwyneth Paltrow's favourite quinoa is still going strong.

The growing backlash comes as a result of friends boasting and posting pictures of their latest foray into fashionable food online.

No more for us: The survey revealed that 32 per cent of Britons are tired of hearing about pulled pork

Cupcakes (32 per cent)

Pulled pork (32 per cent)

Smoothies (17 per cent)

Prosecco (12 per cent)

Sea bass (five per cent)

Kale (five per cent)

North African dishes (five per cent)

Pancetta (four per cent)

Slow roast meat (three per cent)

Haggis (two per cent)

Surprisingly, haggis, a traditional Scottish dish also made the list, with two per cent of those surveyed said they had heard enough about the sheep's lung, liver and heart delicacy.

Cute cupcakes and the seemingly ubiquitous pulled pork took joint first place with 32 per cent saying they were tired of the foods.

Five per cent said they were fed up with healthy kale while 17 per cent claimed they had had enough of smoothies.

North African cuisine, which includes couscous and dishes such as lamb tagine, also made it on the list, with five per cent saying they are tired of it.

Our fascination with Prosecco is also losing its sparkle with 12 per cent saying the fizz is more naff than posh.

Four per cent are fed up with pancetta and claim it's just a fancy Italian name for chopped bacon while three per cent say those who serve slow roasts have nothing to do all day but cook.

The YouGov survey, which was conducted on behalf of Bacofoil, asked consumers which foods they think have become 'too popular' on social media and in general.

'Food trends come and go so it's inevitable that people will get tired of things and want to move on,' said Adrian Brown, managing director of Bacofoil.

Cupcakes (32 per cent) and kale (five per cent) also made it into the top ten must not have foods list

Four per cent say that the word pancetta is simply a fancy way of describing bacon

'When Bacofoil was invented in the 1960s, fondues were all the rage along with prawn cocktail and funnily enough they're now making a bit of a comeback.

'By contrast, cupcakes are full of calories and they're artificial in flavour. So it's a case of being naughty but not nice. 

'I think we'll see a return of proper old fashioned cakes like Dundee cake, Bakewell tarts and malt loaf. The sort of cakes that your grandma would make and keep in a tin.

'Foods like clothes go in and out of fashion. Cup cakes and pulled pork turned up everywhere last year.

'But this year we're likely to see a move away from anything too fancy or artificial which is why cup cakes have become less popular and people are rediscovering grandmas' cakes recipes which are simple and wholesome.'

He added: 'The results of the research will be of interest to companies with an eye on new product development and consumers who want to avoid serving up the dishes that are considered boring.'
