A 39-year-old man was in custody Friday in connection with the deaths of a Detroit-area couple who were fatally shot, dismembered and discovered miles away in and near the Detroit River, police said.

Police refused to say if the suspect was the same man who recently moved in with the victims, 42-year-old Chris Hall and fiancee Danielle Greenway, 32. That man was picked up at the house by police Thursday, neighbors said.

Two bodies with no feet, heads or hands 
were found Tuesday in the Detroit River and a canal that feeds the 
river, a mile-wide body of water that separates Detroit from Windsor, 
Ontario.

In custody: Police wait outside an Allen Park, Michigan home on Friday; A man who recently moved in with a couple whose decapitated bodies were discovered floating miles away in Detroit was removed from the home by police

Charges likely are the next step, said Allen Park Police Chief James Wilkewitz, who called the deaths 'heinous' and not a random act. The suspect's name was not released.

A circular saw and a suitcase were also discovered. Relatives of the victims reported them missing Wednesday after having no contact for at least five days.

'It makes my heart drop,' neighbor Samantha Dolliver said. 'They were the sweetest people. It hasn't hit me yet. But when it does, I'm going to barricade myself in a room with a pillow and cry. ... They were human beings, not a piece of scrap metal.'

Police released few details at a news conference Friday but asked for the public's help in locating Greenway's van, a tan 2005 GMC Safari with Michigan license plate 7JCM9.

'We still have a lot of work left to do,' Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee said. Meanwhile, yellow police tape was stretched around the home while a state police evidence technician, wearing gloves and foot protection, went in and out. A car and a boat were parked in the driveway.

A Greenway family friend, April Purdin, told The Associated Press that the man who was living in the home was Greenway's ex-boyfriend. Dolliver said she knew him only as 'Roger' and that he arrived about three weeks ago.

Dolliver said Hall's sister was searching for the couple Wednesday and pounded on the couple's door. She had no luck.

'She said she had a feeling in the pit of her stomach that something was wrong,' Dolliver said.

Dolliver's father, Richard, also a neighbor, said Hall was an electrician and Greenway worked for a cleaning service. He last saw them about a week ago.

'She made us cookies and banana-nut bread all the time,' he said of Greenway. Richard Dolliver said he asked Greenway about the man who moved in.

Found: The decapitated bodies of a man and a woman were pulled from the Detroit River

'She said he was a friend who needed help,' he recalled.

U.S. Border Patrol agents spotted the first body from shore about 6:45 a.m. in Fox Creek earlier this week. The creek empties into the mile-wide Detroit River.

The U.S. Coast Guard was called in to retrieve the body, and on their way to Fox Creek, guardsmen found the second mutilated body floating in the river.

About an hour later, Fussell was getting ready to set up his fishing gear along the river seawall when he looked into the partially clear and greenish water near Fox Creek. About 10 feet down, he said, he saw what looked like ‘three legs.’

‘They were submerged in the water,’ the 53-year-old said. ‘A sheet was in the water. A saw was there. A suitcase, too.’

The bodies and body parts were turned over to the Wayne County medical examiner's office, whose investigators wouldn't comment on the case.

Outside of the body parts found by Fussell, police wouldn't comment on whether anything else was found in the river. They also were not sure if the body parts belonged to the bodies found floating in the water.

Investigators said there were few if any clues pointing to the circumstances that led to the bodies being dumped in the water.

‘I have no idea, to be honest with you. It is different,’ Sgt. Shawn Wesley said during a news conference not far from where the body parts were found in the Detroit River, which separates Detroit from Windsor, Ontario.

That section of the river, along the city's far east side, is popular with anglers who typically arrive around dawn during the warm summer months to fish for walleye, rock bass and other fish.

Border patrol agents often patrol the area.

Mystery: The bodies, which were also missing hands and feet, didn't provide any immediate clues about the deaths or potential suspects

Fox Creek meanders through a wooded area where small clumps of trees are broken up by pockets of high grass and tall weeds. 

The area has received very little 
maintenance over the years, so trash — plastic soda bottles, empty packs
of cigarettes, clothing, even a baby's crib mattress — litter the 
ground.

A small boat sat abandoned on a rarely used parking lot.

The
creek also connects to a series of narrow canals that abut backyards 
and the rear of some homes. Many of those home owners have boats and 
direct access to the river.
