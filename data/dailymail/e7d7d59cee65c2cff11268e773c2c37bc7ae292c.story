President Barack Obama told mourners at an emotional memorial service for victims of a Texas plant explosion that their community is not alone at this time of great tragedy.

With a dozen flag-draped coffins of before him, Obama said: 'We're neighbors too. We're American too, we stand with you and we do not forget.'

The April 17 fertilizer plant fire in West, Texas, erupted and leveled part of the town and killed 14 people. The memorial service was held at Baylor University in nearby Waco.

'This small town's family is bigger 
now,' Obama said during a memorial service at Baylor University for 
victims of last week's explosion in nearby West, Texas, that killed 14 
and injured 200.

Nearly 10,000 gathered to remember 
the first responders killed in the blast, a crowd more than triple the 
size of West's entire population of 2,700.

'To the families, the neighbors 
grappling with unbearable loss, we are here to say you are not alone. 
You are not forgotten,' Obama said to applause. 'We may not all live 
here in Texas, but we're neighbors too. We're Americans too, and we 
stand with you.'

The April 17 explosion left a crater 
more than 90 feet wide and damaged dozens of buildings, displacing many 
residents from their homes.

The Insurance Council of Texas estimates it 
caused more than $100 million in damage, and crews were sifting the 
rubble to search for clues to what caused the explosion or whether foul 
play was involved.

The blast came about 20 minutes after
a fire was reported at the West Fertilizer. Ten of those killed were 
first responders who sped out to the nighttime blaze.

The memorial service honored those 
first responders and two civilians who tried to fight the fire and were 
posthumously named volunteer first responders.

Among the dead were 
brothers Douglas and Robert Snokhous, West High School graduates who 
volunteered together for the town's fire department for more than 13 
years.

As Obama spoke, the gymnasium lit up 
with the flashes of cameras and cellphones, glimmering like stars in the
dimly lit room. The president spoke for 16 minutes, quoting scripture 
and lauding the men whose flag-draped coffins laid before him.

'When you got to the scene, you forgot fear and you fought that blaze as hard as you could, knowing the danger,' Obama said.

The service opened with a photo slide
show set to country music that was projected onto a movie screen. It 
showed images of the men from their childhood, their weddings and other 
moments throughout lives filled with children and friends.

Mourners were
given programs with full-page profiles of each of the victims, 
describing their lives, their values and their faith.

'How does one find such love to be 
willing to lay down your life so that others may live?' asked Texas Sen.
John Cornyn, speaking on behalf of the state's congressional 
delegation.

'This will forever be the legacy of those who ran toward the
fire last week.'

Texas Gov. Rick Perry eulogized the 
unpaid first responders, lamenting that each had a personal story and 
journey that drew to a close too soon.

'These are volunteers. Ordinary 
individuals blessed with extraordinary courage and a determination to do
what they could to save lives,' he said.

'They're the ones who proudly 
said 'not on my watch' in the moments immediately following that 
explosion.'

Perry's remarks were followed by 
video of the victims' grim-faced family members remembering their lives 
and expressing pride for their heroism.

The brother-in-law of Cody 
Dragoo, another volunteer firefighter, remembered how Dragoo would leave
notes for his wife, Patty, when he was traveling, and how he loved 
hunting and NASCAR.

Obama added his appearance at the 
memorial service onto a long-planned trip to Texas for Thursday's 
opening of George W. Bush's presidential library at Southern Methodist 
University.

Bush sent his sympathies in a 
statement read at the service by Baylor President Ken Starr, the former 
special prosecutor who investigated President Bill Clinton.

Obama's solemn reflections at the 
memorial required an abrupt shift in tone by the president, whose 
morning in Dallas was filled with smiles, music and pageantry as he and 
the other four living presidents celebrated one of their own.

Less than an hour later, Obama was 
airborne over West, circling the scene of the explosion - still a 
harrowing site more than a week after tragedy first touched the small 
Texas town.

From his helicopter, Obama saw what 
looked like a massive construction site, with cranes and dozens of 
vehicles dotting a wide swath of brown earth.

Piles of burnt rubble and 
scorched earth were clearly visible. Obama could also see the school 
field first responders used as a staging ground.

Obama has made such a trip countless 
times before, touring damage and consoling survivors of other disasters 
including Hurricane Irene, Hurricane Sandy and a string of mass 
shootings.

It was just one week ago that Obama 
was in Boston, offering solace to the nation at a memorial for victims 
of the Boston Marathon bombing, another larger-than-life tragedy that 
compounded the nation's grief the same week as the explosion in West.

A parade of fire trucks and other 
first responders' vehicles paraded through Waco en route to the ceremony
at Baylor's sports arena.

The vehicles entered under an archway formed 
by the ladders from two fire trucks with an American flag hung between 
them.

Many of the mourners wore the uniforms of police, firefighters and paramedics and wiped tears from their eyes.

Brian Crawford, fire chief in the 
Dallas suburb of Plano, attended with 11 others from his department even
though they live 100 miles from West.

'With these unfortunate 
circumstances, it's time to show we are all a family,' Crawford said. 
'These were our brothers and they paid the price.'

After the service, the president and 
first lady Michelle Obama were planning to visit privately with 
relatives and friends of firefighters killed in the explosion, the White
House said.

Obama attended the service with first lady Michele Obama on the same day he shared the stage in Dallas with four former presidents gathered for the dedication of George W. Bush's presidential library.

Obama says: 'We give thanks for the courage and the compassion and incredible grace of the people of West.'
