A nurse who stabbed her four-year-old daughter to death before turning the knife on herself after being caught leaking patient details has been jailed for 12 years.

Dawn Makin, 35, who is now confined to a wheelchair by the injuries she inflicted on herself in the suicide attempt, was in a ‘spiral of descent into despair’ leading up to the killing, a court heard.

The nurse of 15 years had lost her job after being unmasked as a ‘mole’ for feeding confidential data about patients to her boyfriend who worked for a personal injuries company.

Guilty: Dawn Makin as arrived at Preston Crown court in Lancashire, in a wheelchair, where she was jailed for 12 years yesterday after she stabbed her daughter at the family home

Happy times: Dawn Makin with her daughter Chloe, who she admitted killing before attempting to take her own life

Beautiful: Chloe's body was found on February 17 after her 'frantic' grandmother, Sheila Makin, raised the alarm. A neighbour broke down the door and made the discovery

Seven months later she killed 
four-year-old Chloe Burke before slashing her own wrists and drinking 
anti-freeze on Valentine’s Day last year.

The little girl was found dead in 
Makin’s bed wearing pyjamas and surrounded by cuddly toys, with her 
mother unconscious beside her.

Chloe suffered deep wounds to her neck 
and chest and tests showed she would have been alive for a number of 
hours after the attack.

Injuries on her hands show the little girl tried
to protect herself, Preston Crown Court heard.

Victim: Chloe Burke was found lying dead on her mother's bed in clean pyjamas and a dressing gown surrounded by cuddly toys

Together: Makin playing with her daughter, four, on a bouncy castle before she killed her daughter and tired to kill herself

Happier time: Dawn Makin was described as a 'model mother' who came from a good Christian family

Judge Anthony Russell yesterday said 
Makin had been suffering from a depressive disorder at the time of the 
killing. She wept as he jailed her for manslaughter, telling her: ‘The 
facts of this case are appalling.

Michael Burke, Chloe's father, outside court yesterday. He said he was shocked at the sentence imposed on his former partner

‘The victim was a four-year-old child, someone who trusted you.

‘This was a sustained attack. Chloe must have undergone significant and considerable physical and emotional suffering.

‘Finally, the physical injuries you 
have caused to yourself which are permanent and the knowledge you have 
killed your only child will be with you for the rest of your life.’

Makin had been investigated and sacked for illegally accessing a 
computer at Moorgate Primary Care walk-in centre in Bury, Greater 
Manchester.

Boyfriend Martin Campbell, 34, used 
the details of 29 road accident victims who had been treated at the 
centre to make contact and try to encourage them to make personal 
injuries claims in December 2009, the court heard.

The leaks emerged 
after patients started to complain to NHS Bury in May 2010.

Campbell was
fined after admitting data protection offences in June last year.

Makin 
was sacked in August 2010 but did not tell family and friends.

Prosecutor Stephen Wright said: ‘She did seek further employment but every application floundered. She was getting nowhere.’

That month she tried to take her own 
and Chloe’s life using gas, but stopped before any serious harm was 
caused.

Makin left and right: The court heard how she sent a number of 'angry' text messages to
her former lover after their split, saying: 
'I'll make sure you pay for this for the rest of your life'

Tragic: Chloe in the back seat of a car. Her father said that his daughter could now rest. He said she was buried a short distance from his home and he visits her grave often

She and Mr Campbell then separated, to her ‘great distress’, and
he left their Bury home.

On the day of the killing, Makin 
learned she was being summonsed to court to face data protection 
offences. She tried to rekindle her relationship with Campbell that day 
but he told her he was taking another woman out for dinner.

‘She was in an emotional spiral of 
descent into despair,’ said Mr Wright. She sent text messages to 
Campbell saying: ‘I’ll make  sure you pay for this for the rest of your 
life’ and ‘I feel really low. My life is over.’

A neighbour discovered the youngster’s
body three days later after her ‘frantic’ grandmother, Sheila Makin, 
raised the alarm. Suicide notes were found including: ‘I am so sorry. I 
have taken her away from you all but I could not leave her with no 
money. That would be cruel.’

Makin was charged with murder ten 
months later. She suffered brain injuries from the anti-freeze which 
caused her loss of mobility.

After the verdict, Chloe’s father, 
Michael, who had split from Makin three years before the tragedy, said: 
‘This has been an absolute nightmare. I just want Chloe to rest now.’

Regret: Makin's solicitor said outside court that Makin was 'seriously mentally deranged' and 'must now live with the consequences'
