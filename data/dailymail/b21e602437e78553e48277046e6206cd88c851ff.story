Low numbers: Dr Ion Jinga, Romania's ambassador in Britain, says only two dozen of his countrymen have entered the UK since January 1

Fewer than 25 Romanians have entered Britain since labour market restrictions were relaxed on January 1, according to the country's ambassador in London.

Dr Ion Jinga claims the predicted rush of his countrymen to the UK after EU border controls were relaxed has not happened.

The diplomat also says that ten companies have contacted his London embassy trying to get Romanians to work for them, and they have been forced to direct them to the Jobcentre.

British border officials have not published figures showing how many Romanians and Bulgarians have entered the country since New Year's Day.

But in Holland they say that 21 from Romania and 15 from Bulgaria have arrived in the past two weeks, and Mr Jinga says it will be similar for the UK.

'I do not see any reason why Holland would be less attractive than the
 UK, with the geographic proximity playing in favour of the Dutch. What 
we know is that on the flight into Luton airport on Jan 1, only two 
Romanians took advantage of the lifting of border restrictions in 
Britain,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

Mr Jinga said that companies who have contacted them were urged by Romanian officials to advertise in the Jobcentre, not directly through them.

'British companies are currently advertising 5,000 posts for Romanians to plug gaps in the highly skilled jobs market,' he said.

Romania is trying its hardest to stop a surge of its nationals leaving the country for the rest of the EU to keep its own economy stable.

But the promise of higher wages elsewhere is difficult to resist now controls on movement were lifted.

Victor Spirescu, 30, was treated to Costa Coffee by Labour MP Keith Vaz when he landed in England on New Year's Day after labour market restrictions were relaxed.

He insisted he was here to work and not 'rob your country' when he arrived and said he was off to clean cars outside Aldi in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire.

But his his career at a car wash lasted just a day before he quit and disappeared.

It came as former Tory Chancellor Kenneth Clarke dismissed suggestions that the EU is to blame for ‘unsustainable’ levels of immigration.

Mr Clarke, who sits in the Cabinet as the prime minister’s trade envoy, said: ‘I just don’t think it’s true that the European Union is responsible for unacceptable waves of migration. The idea that you can have some fundamental debate that somehow stops all these foreigners coming here is rather typical right-wing, nationalist escapism.’

It caused a clash with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who insisted the lifting of controls on incomers from eastern European countries who joined the EU had triggered ‘large-scale migration’ and had been a ‘mistake’.

But Laszlo Andor, the EU’s social affairs commissioner, suggested Britons were ‘emotional and misguided’ over the issue and would ‘pay more attention to the facts’ in the absence of a big influx from Bulgaria and Romania.
