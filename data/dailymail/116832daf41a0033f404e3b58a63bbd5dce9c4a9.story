Those children born to teenage mothers tend not to perform as well academically as the children of older mothers, a new study has found. 

A team of scientists at the University of Michigan found the level of education a mother attains can predict her children's success in reading and maths.

Their findings showed that success is greater if a mother had her child later in life.

Sandra Tang, the study's lead author, said children born to mothers aged 19 or older usually enter kindergarten with higher levels of achievement.

She said the researchers found these children continued to excel in maths and reading at higher levels by the time they reach 13 to 14, when compared to those children of mothers 18 and younger.

'These results provide compelling evidence that having a child during adolescence has enduring negative consequences for the achievement of the next generation,' Dr Tang said.

The negative consequences of teen mothers were found not only to affect the child born when the mother was an adolescent, but also any subsequent children. 

Professor Pamela Davis-Kean, of the Institute for Social Research and Center for Human Growth and Development, said the findings present good news and bad news.

'The good news is that the children of teen mothers who continue their education after having children do better academically than children of teen moms who did not continue,' she said.

'However, these children-and other children born to the mother when she wasn't an adolescent-never catch up in achievement across time to children whose mothers had them after completing their education. 

'This group continues to carry a risk for lower achievement.'

The study's data was taken from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, a nationally representative sample of children who were first assessed upon entering kindergarten in 1998 and were interviewed through spring 2007.

In 14,279 cases, the children's maths and reading scores were collected in third, fifth and eighth grades.

Researchers used this data to compare achievement trajectories of children born either to teen mothers aged 18 or younger to adult mothers, aged 19 and older.

The analyses took into account mothers' educational expectations for their children, the home environment and other characteristics, such as household income, that may influence children's achievement.

Trends indicate that mothers who give birth during adolescence have much lower rates of high school completion and college enrollment in comparison to their counterparts who delay pregnancy.

Dr Tang said given that growth in achievement generally stays the same across time for math and reading for all children in the sample, these patterns highlight the importance of investing in early interventions that target adolescent mothers and provide them with the skills needed to promote their children's learning.
