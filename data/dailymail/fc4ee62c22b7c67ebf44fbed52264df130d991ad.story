Facebook users who delete inappropriate or embarrassing images from their accounts - with the the benefit of hindsight - can now have peace of mind that the files will be permanently destroyed.

Until recently, any pictures erased from an account would in fact 
remain stored by Facebook and anyone who had the direct link 
to that picture could therefore still view it.

The news may come as some relief to young people in the throws of trying get a job or impress a new employer, knowing that many companies today show an interest in the social network accounts of their staff.

Until recently any pictures deleted by an account holder would remain stored on Facebook's server and accessible with the correct link

Pictures now erased by an account user will be permanently wiped from the system within 14 days, but with a potential maximum delay of 30 days. They will be immediately removed from view on a user's account from the moment they delete the picture.

'It has taken them a very long time to do it because this change probably represents a huge engineering effort,' said Cambridge PhD student, Joseph Bonneau, quoted in The Sunday Times.

It was three years ago that the 28-year-old discovered that pictures he had deleted from the site were still available for all to see if they had saved a link to them.

'The lesson hopefully to other companies is to build in privacy right form the start, because if you don't get it right first time, it can be a huge effort to fix,' he said.

At a time when unemployment is high and job security is therefore a high priority for many, potential candidates may be considering how they come across from the information on their social network accounts.

Research suggests that up to 91% of employers now use social sites such as MySpace, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and LinkedIn to screen job applicants.

As many as 69% say they have rejected candidates based on information on their accounts.

There are also numerous cases of employees who have lost their jobs as a result of images or information posted on such social networking media, intentionally or not.

Most notably, US Republican Anthony Weiner resigned after publicly posting a lewd picture of himself to a woman on Twitter, instead of privately sending the photo to her account.

Also in the US, schoolteacher Ashley Payne, 24, was given the option of resigning or a suspension after a parent complained about a Facebook photo of her with a glass of wine and a pint of beer. She resigned.

Some experts say that young people should be advised on the risks of sharing everything about their lives on publicly available social networks.Â 

Since Facebook floated on the stock exchange in May this year, some argue that improving glitches in the system, such as picture removal and deletion, will become more pressing concerns for the company as it seeks to be a more attractive media stock than its rivals.
