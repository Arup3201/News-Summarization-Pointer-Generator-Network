Claims: John Humphrys has caused controversy by saying that some of the alleged abuse by Savile was 'banter'

Veteran Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys has today been accused of 'trivialising' alleged abuse by Sir Jimmy Savile - after claiming that some of it was just 'banter'.

In a heated interview with Labour's Deputy Leader Harriet Harman he also denied that some victims had suffered 'serious sexual abuse'.

Mr Humphrys added that the BBC has been drawn into a 'witchhunt' over the issue.

Reacting to his 'banter' comment Ms Harman said: 'We’re talking about serious sexual assault here'.

Humphrys then responded: 'Well we’re not always though, are we? In some cases girls are talking about him putting his hand on their leg.

'That’s not the sort of behaviour we should accept. Nonetheless, in many cases, it’s not serious sexual assault.

'There is a danger of a witchhunt here,' he added, saying that it is very important there is an independent inquiry into what Savile may have done while at the BBC.

Peter Saunders, from the National 
Association of People Abused in Childhood, said: 'These comments 
perpetuate the myth that abuse isn’t a big deal. This is a serious issue
and he’s trivialising it.'

Defending the presenter, a BBC spokesman said: 'John challenged Harriet Harman on the reasons behind her call for an inquiry but he was clear that serious allegations have been made, and he did not trivialise them.'

It came as another woman claimed Jimmy Savile abused her on a cruise as a 16-year-old when he promised her an autograph if she came to his cabin.

Sue Southgate was with her friend in his room when he took off his trousers in front of them on the P&O ship SS Canberra, and then pulled her onto his bed for a 'quick cuddle'.

Allegations: Mr Humphrys also said the BBC could be a victim of a 'witchhunt' and there should be a independent inquiry into what Savile did at the corporation

This was despite her friend having a camera - he was 51 at the time.

'At one point he slipped out of his pants and started rubbing himself up against me. I could feel that he was excited,' she told The Sun.

'He grasped me very tightly in his arms and told me to do the same to him.

'He said,"This is a special move that will help you stop the boys getting away".'

Mrs Southgate, now 51, spoke out days after it was revealed that he was later asked to leave the liner because he targeted a 14-year-old.

She added that she was shocked and ran away because she had innocently believed he was the 'harmless' man that people loved on TV.

Instead, she said, she knew if she hadn't fled she would have been forced to have sex with him.

The captain, who asked not to be named said of his decision to remove Savile: 'The more I quizzed him, the more convinced I became that he was lying.

'He was a shifty sort of chap whose eyes darted all over the place.

'The parents, who were not travelling first class, were very decent, ordinary people who were completely scandalised by Savile’s unwanted attention to their daughter. I told him he disgusted me and I wanted him off my ship when we reached Gibraltar.

'I detailed an officer to make sure he remained in his cabin until we reached the Rock.

'He was to take all his meals in his cabin and was not allowed to leave it under any circumstances short of shipwreck.'
