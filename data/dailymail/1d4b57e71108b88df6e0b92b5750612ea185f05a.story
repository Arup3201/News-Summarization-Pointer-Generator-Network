As the BBC’s political editor, he is supposed to bring gravitas and heavyweight analysis to the Corporation’s coverage of Prime Minister’s Questions.

But Nick Robinson’s most memorable contribution to today’s programme was his iPad suddenly blaring out a Queen song.

As his co-presenters and MPs appeared by baffled by the interruption, he scrambled to turn it off before lyrics to ‘Fat Bottomed Girls’ could be heard on air.

Awkward: BBC political editor Nick Robinson saw the funny side when his iPad started playing Queen, but Labour's Caroline Flint seemed less impressed

The music interrupted a debate on BBC2's Daily Politics  bankers bonuses, minutes after the end of Prime Minister's Questions

The bizarre intervention came during a heated debate on BBC 2’s Daily Politics  about bankers’ bonuses, with Labour’s Caroline Flint berating justice minister Shailesh Vara about the idea of bigger payouts at RBS.

As Miss Flint insisted that high fliers in the Cuty are already well-paid, viewers were treated to the opening lyrics of Fat Bottomed Girls: ‘Are you gonna take me home tonight? Oh, down beside that red firelight; Are you gonna let it all hang out?’

Host Andrew Neil picked up his tablet computer, asking Mr Robinson: ‘Is that you… is that me… oh it’s you.’

Miss Flint was trying to criticise Tory justice minister Shailesh Vara about the need to cap bonus when she was distracted by Freddie Mercury

As the debate continued, Mr Robinson lent in to ask if anyone knew the next line of the song

As Miss Flint looked on – distinctly unimpressed – Mr Robinson quickly opened his iPad mini, and told viewers: ‘I am going to turn it off before the really embarrassing lyrics start.’

He succeeded in pressing pause before Freddie Mercury and co. belted out: ‘Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round.’

Mr Robinson seemed to see the funny side to the gaffe, asking the MPs if they knew what the next line to the song was.

But Miss Flint was determined to get back onto bankers bonuses, claiming ‘this is a conspiracy’ against her scoring political points.
