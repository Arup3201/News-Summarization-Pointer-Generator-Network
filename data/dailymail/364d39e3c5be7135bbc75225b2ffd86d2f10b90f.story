The mother of 11-year-old Luke Batty who was murdered by his father earlier this year has told of her life living in fear of her violent former partner.

In a harrowing testimony given on Tuesday, Rosie Batty revealed she and her son were terrified of Greg Anderson, Luke's father.

'We locked the doors... we had a baseball bat in one bedroom, we had a baseball bat in another bedroom,' Ms Batty said in court, the ABC reported.

'This is what I was living with. The police were telling me we can't be there in time if he wants to kill you... perhaps you should consider moving back to England.'

She broke down multiple times in the witness box, revealing her angst over not knowing how to tell Mr Anderson he couldn't see his son.

'I couldn't do it. I so wanted him to take out his hatred on someone else,' Ms Batty said.

She also said that Mr Anderson's mental illness was 'sabotaging everything in his life', but spoke of the close relationship Luke and his father shared.

Ms Batty also revealed she feared her son's father may have been contemplating killing their child in a murder suicide but believed the 11-year-old would be safe in public places.

Ms Batty said she started believing Greg Anderson could pose a physical risk to their son when he showed Luke Batty a knife and told him 'this could be the one to end it all'.

But she believed he would be safe with his father so long as they were in public areas like the football or cricket oval, Ms Batty told an inquest into Luke's death at his father's hands at a Victorian oval.

'I didn't know if Greg was referring to his own suicide tendencies or if he would like to have a joint suicide,' she told the Victorian Coroners Court on Tuesday.

She said she started to believe Mr Anderson could pose a physical risk to their son when he showed Luke a knife and told him 'this could be the one to end it all'

'That image of him harming him (Luke) couldn't happen in a public place.

'It couldn't happen at the Tyabb oval but it bloody did.'

Anderson murdered his 11-year-old son by hitting him with a cricket bat then attacking him with a knife while they played together in the nets following cricket training in Tyabb in February.

The 54-year-old was shot by police and died in hospital.

After the knife incident in April 2013, Ms Batty won an order to deny Anderson access to Luke, but it was changed to allow him to see his son in public at weekly sporting events just three months later. 

Earlier this week it was revealed Luke Batty's father told ambulance workers to let him die after he killed his 11-year-old son at a Victorian cricket oval during a custody visit.

Greg Anderson was covered with blood and holding a knife when he lunged at emergency services workers called to the Tyabb oval on February 12, an inquest into Luke's death has heard.

The 54-year-old was shot by police and said 'let me die' as paramedics attempted to treat him, the Victorian Coroners Court heard on Monday. 

Mr Anderson and Luke were practising in the cricket nets, 'substantially on their own', when the attack happened, but it was witnessed by an eight-year-old boy, the inquest heard

Mr Anderson and Luke were practising in the cricket nets, 'substantially on their own', when the attack happened, but it was witnessed by an eight-year-old boy, the inquest heard.

Luke died after Mr Anderson struck him with a cricket bat and attacked him with a knife. 

The boy saw Mr Anderson raise the bat over his right shoulder but did not see it connect with Luke.

He ran and told his father, who called paramedics.

When emergency services workers arrived they saw Mr Anderson kneeling by Luke.

At first they thought he was helping him, the inquest heard.  

When ambulance workers tried to approach Luke, Mr Anderson said 'he's in heaven now'.

Mr Anderson died in hospital from gunshot wounds and self-inflicted knife wounds.

The inquest heard that in the months before he killed his son, Mr Anderson once held up a knife while talking to Luke and said: 'This could be the one to end it all.'

Luke reported the incident to police and a child protection officer, but told them that he loved his father and was not in fear of him, the inquest heard. 

Luke's mother, Rosie Batty, said she had always wanted her son to have a relationship with his father. 

'For me it's really important a child should know his father,' she told the inquest.

'Greg was really loving and keen to be involved in Luke's life.

'But I said to myself this is a journey, I'll keep doing things that feel right until they didn't feel right anymore.'

Ms Batty said she changed her mind in April 2013 when Luke revealed his father had shown him the knife while Anderson prayed in his car.

'I was so alarmed I knew I could no longer support his relationship with his father,' Ms Batty said.

Mr Anderson's contact with Luke was restricted by an intervention order from May 2012, but that was changed to block access to his son in April 2013.

Counsel assisting the inquest, Rachel Ellyard, said the order was changed again in July 2013 to allow Mr Anderson access to Luke at football and cricket matches on the weekend. 

Ms Ellyard said Mr Anderson was technically in breach of that order by seeing Luke at cricket training on a weekday.

The inquest heard Ms Batty was not told Mr Anderson had failed to appear in court on charges of assault and not answering bail.

She learned that Anderson's housemate sought and was granted an intervention order in January this year through media reports.

Ms Batty said when she saw Mr Anderson at the cricket oval on the night of Luke's death it occurred to her to call the police, but she decided not to. 

She said she had previously had unpleasant situations trying to get the police involved at the cricket club.

Ms Batty said she didn't trust the situation, and previous attempts had been traumatic, stressful and unpredictable.

She said she thought: 'This will be the third time I've tried to get this man arrested in front of Luke and his friends at that bloody oval.'

The police had Anderson's address, so she thought it would be better if they arrested him there, discretely, Ms Batty told the inquest. 

Ms Ellyard said key issues to be explored during the inquest included the assessments of Mr Anderson made by police and the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the supervision orders dictating Mr Anderson's contact with Luke.

The information sharing between Ms Batty, the DHS and police, and any changes DHS and police have made to their procedures since Luke's murder, would also be investigated.

More broadly, Ms Ellyard said the inquest would look into whether there were any signs Anderson had the potential for violence towards Luke and whether they could have been acted on.
