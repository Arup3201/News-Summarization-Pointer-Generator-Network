The British nurse who survived Ebola has criticised the international response to the crisis as being 'woefully slow', after returning to help treat victims in Sierra Leone.

The 29-year-old, from Eyke, Suffolk, said arriving back to the country where he contracted the deadly disease, he was left shocked at 'seeing so many dead people'.

He returned to West Africa last month, and is treating patients in an Ebola isolation unit run by UK medical staff in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone - one of the three countries worst hit by the epidemic.

The outbreak has killed almost 5,200 people, almost all in West Africa, according to the World Health Organisation. 

WHO experts said yesterday they hope the numbers of cases will start falling sharply in the new year as they stressed the need to develop new diagnostic tests to identify the disease in the later stages of the outbreak.

British nurse Will Pooley, 29, from Eyke in Suffolk has criticised the international response to the Ebola crisis as 'woefully slow', after he returned to Sierra Leone to help treat victims after recovering from the disease

Pierre Formenty, said: 'We are looking at where we will be in four to six months from now when the cases (could) decrease sharply and we will try to find the very last cases.' 

'We're not saying it's over,' he stressed, but added that the WHO hopes that by March the three countries worst hit by this outbreak - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - will be seeing between five and 10 cases a week. 

But four months into the crisis in Sierra Leone the number of cases are still rising.

Mr Pooley said vast numbers of people, including young children are dying because of the 'slow' response by European nations and the U.S. 

The nurse, who described seeing between eight to 10 corpses a day, said: 'The response has been woefully slow.

'People don't have any appreciation of the numbers of people, little kids that are dying.

'Because people are being too slow back in Europe and the States and elsewhere.' 

He is working at the Connaught Hospital in Freetown, run by British-based King's Sierra Leone Partnership.

The 18-bed Ebola isolation ward is full, meaning one victim has to recover or pass away from the disease before another person can be helped.

A screening tent in the hospital grounds holds those people medics suspect are infected.

Currently Mr Pooley said there are four people waiting to for treatment inside the tent, some will likely perish there. 

'We've got one bed at the moment and there's four suspects in the tent,' he said.

The BBC reported all four patients appear terrified.

Mr Pooley said vast numbers of people, including young children are dying because of the 'slow' response by European nations and the U.S.

He was repatriated to the UK in August after being contracting the virus while he worked in the Kenema, in eastern Sierra Leone

He was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London where he was given the experimental drug Zmapp. He was discharged after fully recovering on September 3

One, a woman, lies on the floor retching. Despite her dire state, visibly reeling from the effects of the vicious disease, this woman is one of the 'lucky' ones.

Mr Pooley decides she will move to inhabit the free bed on the isolation ward, while her fellow victims inside the tent will have to wait.

As Christmas approaches the 29-year-old's mind is clear.

While the thought of celebrating at home in Suffolk is obviously appealing, his duty is to remain on the front line where he can make a difference.

'The thought of Christmas at home is great in some ways,' he said. 'But you're not going to be able to switch off and enjoy your roast and relaxing with your family when you know what's going on here.

'When you know what you should be doing.'

Mr Pooley was the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola. He was flown back to the UK in August, where he was treated at London's Royal Free Hospital.

He received the experimental drug Zmapp, and was discharged from hospital on September 3 after making a full recovery.

Last month he made the decision to return to West Africa, driven by his desire to help the people and communities at the heart of the catastrophic outbreak, the most deadly since Ebola was first discovered by scientists in 1976.

In October Mr Pooley returned to Sierra Leone with the King's Sierra Leone Partnership to treat victims on an isolation ward at Freetown's Connaught Hospital

Another corpse is removed from a home in Freetown. Mr Pooley said he was surprised on returning to West Africa at 'seeing so many dead bodies'

Mr Pooley said: 'The real emergency is in West Africa, and the teams out there need all the support we can give them.' 

He joined the King's Health Partnership in October - a partnership between King's College London and three NHS trusts - Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital and South London and Maudsley.  

The virus, which  emerged in a small village in Guinea last December, has ravaged the country, as well as neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia.

In August the WHO declared the crisis, an international emergency.

A British patient is currently awaiting results of a test to establish whether he has Ebola, after arriving at a GP clinic in Hereford on Monday with diarrhoea and reporting he had recently travelled to West Africa. 

On Sunday, David Cameron announced plans to invest a further £1.34 million with the Wellcome Trust, in new research to fight the deadly virus.

The Prime Minister pledged the new funds after securing a commitment from leading world powers at the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, to 'do what is necessary to ensure the international effort can extinguish the outbreak'.   

The funding will support five projects run by leading British and international researchers in a bid to improve evidence and understanding of the Ebola outbreak.

The UK, which has so far committed £125 million to tackling Ebola, has put pressure on other wealthy countries to do more to combat the spread of the virus.
