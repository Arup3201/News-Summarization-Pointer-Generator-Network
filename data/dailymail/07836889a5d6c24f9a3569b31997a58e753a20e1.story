Stephen Collins appears to be making his exit from Hollywood.

The scandal-plagued 7th Heaven star and his estranged wife, Faye Grant, have just listed their two adjacent houses in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, with one property going for $2.85 million and the other for $2.7 million.

This as the actor continues to be investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department, New York police and the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department for alleged sex abuse.

Getting out: These listings (above) come just three weeks after audio was released that reportedly features Collins 'admitting to molesting underage girls'

Split: Collins and his wife Fay Grant (above) are currently in the process of divorcing

He has also lost roles in the film Ted 2 and television series Scandal, while also being dropped by his agency, in the wake of these ongoing child molestation investigations, which first surfaced earlier this month. 

Collins and Grant purchased the smaller of the properties in 1997 for $950,000, snatching up the neighboring one in April 2003 for $1.4 million.

According to Variety, 'the two properties encompass half an acre of flat land and both houses have been extensively and expensively remodeled and upgraded with wood floors, lots of crown moldings, vaulted ceilings and sky lights, tumbled marble counter tops and mosaic tile fireplaces and back splashes.'

One of the property's also boasts 'a lagoon-style swimming pool in the backyard.'

Collins has recently been staying at a rental property in the city's Tarzana neighborhood, the same place officers were called to back on October 7 when someone reported hearing what sounded like a single gunshot coming from the actor's residence.

It was later revealed he was not even home at the time.

No work: Collins (above) has lost work in Ted 2 and Scandal following news he was being investigated for molestation

That same morning, audio was released of a man with Collins' distinct voice admitting to exposing himself to an 10-year-old relative, before going on to say he exposed himself to several other girls. 

It is still not certain who leaked the unlawfully recorded audio to the press.
