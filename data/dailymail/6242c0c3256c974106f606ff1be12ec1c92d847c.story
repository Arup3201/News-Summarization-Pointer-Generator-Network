Shocking new data has found that suicide rates in several states have increased dramatically in the past decade, with Wyoming and North Dakota showing the most troubling rise.

Wyoming reported an increase of just under 78.8 per cent over the last 10 years. Closely behind was North Dakota, with 70.5 per cent.

Following those states were Rhode Island, Hawaii and Vermont.

North Dakota's neighbor to the south was also represented on the list, rounding out the top 10.

Troubling information: Shocking new data has found that suicide rates in several states have increased dramatically in the past decade

The findings were reported by The Atlantic Cities, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

In terms of regions, the Midwest saw the greatest climb in suicide with a 35.6 per cent increase. The Northeast was just behind with 32.7 per cent.

The new CDC report is being called the
first to show how the trend is playing out nationally and to look in 
depth at the racial and geographic breakdown.

The suicide rate registered a statistically significant increase in 39 out of 50 states.

The West and the South had the highest
suicide rates. It's not clear why, but one factor may be cultural 
differences in willingness to seek help during tough times, said Thomas 
Simon, one of the authors of the CDC report.

Also, it may be more difficult to find counseling and mental health services in certain places, he added.

The state rankings come a week after a government report revealed that the suicide rate among middle-aged Americans leaped an astonishing 28 per cent over the course of just a decade.

Even more shocking is the rate among 
middle aged white men and women. Suicides in that group increased an 
astounding 40 per cent between 1999 and 2010.

Not surprisingly, those years saw the worst recession in recent memory and the accompanying mortgage crisis, which proved catastrophic for many.

Meanwhile, rates in younger and older people held steady. And there was little change among middle-aged blacks, Hispanics and most other racial and ethnic groups.

One theory suggests the recession 
caused more emotional trauma in whites, who tend not to have the same 
kind of church support and extended families that blacks and Hispanics 
do.

The economy was in recession from the end of 2007 until mid-2009.

Even well afterward, polls showed most
Americans remained worried about weak hiring, a depressed housing 
market and other problems.

During the 1999-2010 period, suicide went
from the eighth leading cause of death among middle-aged Americans to 
the fourth, behind cancer, heart disease and accidents.

'Some of us think we're facing an upsurge
as this generation moves into later life,' said Dr Eric Caine, a 
suicide researcher at the University of Rochester.

The CDC findings were based on information from death certificates.

People ages 35 to 64 account for about 57 per cent of suicides in the U.S.

The report contained surprising information about how middle-aged people
kill themselves: During the period studied, hangings overtook drug 
overdoses in that age group, becoming the No. 2 manner of suicide.

But 
guns remained far in the lead and were the instrument of death in nearly
half of all suicides among the middle-aged in 2010.

For the entire U.S. population, there were 38,350 suicides in 2010, making it the nation's 10th leading cause of death, the CDC said.

The overall national suicide rate climbed from 12 suicides per 100,000 people in 1999 to 14 per 100,000 in 2010, a 15 percent increase.

For the middle-aged, the rate jumped from about 14 per 100,000 to nearly 18 â€” a 28 percent increase. Among whites in that age group, it spiked from about 16 to 22.

Suicide prevention efforts have tended to concentrate on teenagers and the elderly, but research over the past several years has begun to focus on the middle-aged.
