Six of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s former platoon mates are shopping proposals for a book and movie manuscript that are fiercely critical of the former prisoner of war.

Since Bergdahl’s controversial release in May, the six have appeared together in the media angered by White House attempts to paint the solider as a ‘war hero’ and united in their belief that he is a deserter.

There are known to be at least two versions of the book, including one which depicts Bergdahl as a ‘premeditated’ deserter who ‘put all of our lives in danger.’

Another slightly more sympathetic version acknowledges that he was ‘likely tortured’ during his five years in captivity and that his fate ‘haunted us daily.’

Bettina Sofia Viviano, a Hollywood agent representing the six, told Yahoo News that she is pitching the proposal to studios as an ‘action-adventure in the vein of Lone Survivor or Saving Private Ryan.'

The situation is complicated as Bergdahl remains under army investigation and if found guilty of being a deserter could be charged with violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The six vets are all potential key witnesses in the investigation into Bergdahl’s 2009 disappearance and several have already been questioned as part of the Army’s investigation.

'I think he should be court-martialed,' Evan Buetow, Bergdahl's former team leader

The former service members say they simply want to set the record straight and they have appeared repeatedly in the media in recent months.

In June the six soldiers appeared on Fox News and all raised their hands when asked if they thought he was a deserter.

‘I think he should be court-martialed,’ Evan Buetow, Bergdahl's former team leader, told Yahoo News. ‘What we know is he's a deserter.’

Another issue is that Bergdahl’s release has become a political football with Republicans highly critical of the Obama administration’s handling of the affair which saw five Taliban Guantanamo detainees freed in return.

The would-be authors insist that they aren't advancing a political agenda but want to set the record straight, as they see it, about Bergdahl's conduct and President Obama's praise for him at a Rose Garden ceremony in May.

'We didn't
 politicize this,' said Cody Full, Bergdahl's former roommate. 'They 
brought his parents out at a White House Rose Garden ceremony and 
presented him as a hero.’

'There
 was no way we were going to sit down and be quiet while Obama was 
calling him a war hero,' Buetow. 'We're just trying to tell the truth. 
It's not my fault this would make Obama look bad.'

Some publishers are hesitant to back 
the project while it remains a controversial issue according to a litery
 agent working on the project.

'Conservatives
 are all over Bergdahl and using it against Obama,' Sarah Durand, a 
senior editor at Atria Books wrote to one of the soldiers' agents, 
according to the report.

'[M]y concern is that this book will have to become a kind of "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth'" she wrote, referencing efforts by Navy veterans who served with John Kerry questioning his service in Vietnam.

Bergdahl's
 former colleagues portray him as an oddball and a 'loner' who seemed 
initially excited to fight the Taliban, but then spoke about 
disappearing in the mountains.

They
 also discuss the frantic search for Bergdahl after he disappeared, 
codenamed 'Operation Yukon Recovery,' carried out in difficult 
conditions.

The 
account also questions whether he aided the Taliban after he disappeared
 from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured.

Bergdahl was released in May, after the Obama administration for him. He spent nearly five years in captivity.
