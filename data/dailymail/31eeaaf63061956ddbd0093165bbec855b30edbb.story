A couple who stole 17 poppy collections tins in the days before Remembrance Sunday have been warned they are facing prison.

Heroin addicts Roma Taylor, 51, and Anthony Archer, 53, distracted shop staff and in some cases replaced the real tin with a dummy one to steal the Royal British Legion tins, a court heard.

In a spree of thefts between October 28 and November 8 last year, the pair stole thousands of pounds of donations from the Poppy Appeal.

They had targeted shops across Essex including Colchester, Tiptree, Chelmsford and Maldon.

Judge Christopher Ball QC, at Chelmsford Crown Court, said: 'The reports may help the sentencing judge find out what drives people to sink as low as this, to steal charity collection boxes in the days leading up to November 11.

'You are plainly at risk of a severe sentence because of the public abhorrence learning of a campaign like this to steal the Poppy Day money, which went on for a fortnight.'

Victims and fundraisers have said there are relieved Taylor, of Tiptree, and Archer of Writtle, in Essex, will be jailed. 

Speaking after the hearing, Terry Sutton, president of the Colchester branch of the Royal British Legion, said: 'It's a shame when people have to go to the depths of stealing from old servicemen.

'I'm pleased the police have managed to catch them.

'I have got no sympathy them. Perhaps they deserve some time in prison to help them reform.'

Archer and Taylor were remanded in custody and will be sentenced next month, once reports are prepared by the Probation Service.

Frank O'Toole, mitigating, said they both were 'heavily addicted to heroin and have been for some considerable time.'

The cashier was distracted by Taylor while Archer cut the wire on the tin and hid it under his jacket.

Kevin Fisher, who is in charge of the food department, said: 'I'm not surprised they will be going to jail because it is a really low thing to do.

'You never know what is going to happen when things such as charity tins get stolen so I am really glad the police caught them.

'We are just glad we managed to help get them caught.'

Sue Allen-Shepherd, Royal British Legion appeal organiser in Tiptree, said the charity received an anonymous donation of £500 to make up for the thefts.

She said: 'It's very sad thing that people steal from charities.

'We don't know their circumstances, whether they are straight forwardly dishonest or desperate for money but it's difficult to believe this kind of thing happens.

'Obviously they had cottoned on to it and they chose a year when people were being very generous. It's the static collections in shops which are vulnerable.'

Sholto Morton, 79, Poppy Appeal organiser in the Maldon areas said he was delighted the two thieves had been caught.

He said: 'The police are to be congratulated for catching them. A prison sentence seems appropriate and we certainly hope that this doesn't happen again.'

Most shops secure collection tins to the counter, but Mr Morton said he will not put additional security measures into place.

He said: 'Short of having a chain on every one, which is going a bit over the top.'

Despite the thefts Mr Morton's collectors had a record year, collecting £34,000 as the Poppy Appeal marked 100 years since the beginning of the First World War.

Asda supermarket and Millins butchers, both Church Road, Tiptree, were also targeted.
