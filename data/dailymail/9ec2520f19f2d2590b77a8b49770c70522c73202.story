Former Treasury secretary and senior White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, who was considered the leading candidate to succeed Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve chairman, has withdrawn from consideration, the White House announced Sunday.

Summers' withdrawal followed growing resistance from critics, including some members of the Senate committee that would need to back his nomination.

A letter signed by 350 economists last week calling on President Barack Obama to nominate Federal 
Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen to be the Fed's next chairman was designed to draw attention back to Yellen amid signs that 
Obama was leaning toward nominating his former economic adviser Summers.

Top choice: U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen speaking at a international monetary conference in Shanghai in June

If chosen by President 
Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate, Yellen will become the first 
woman to lead the Fed.

In the past, Obama has mentioned only one
other candidate as possibly being under consideration: Donald Kohn, a 
former Fed vice chair. But Kohn, 70, has been considered a long shot.

The
administration also reached out to former Treasury Secretary Timothy 
Geithner early in the process. Geithner said he was not interested in 
being considered.

Obama is expected to announce a nominee for the Fed chairmanship as early as this month. Bernanke's term ends January 31, 2014.

Some economists said Sunday that they think Summers' exit significantly boosts the likelihood of a Yellen nomination.

'The
odds that the president will nominate Janet Yellen are now much 
higher,' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.

Still, Zandi added, 'There is a chance that there is some dark horse candidate, possibly Tim Geithner.'

David
Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors and the author of several books 
on the Fed, said he saw Yellen's selection as a virtual certainty.

'There
is a strong view that making a woman Fed chair is an important step,' 
Jones said. 'There is no question that her experience qualifies her for 
the role.'

Summers and his allies had been engaged in an 
unusually public contest with Yellen supporters, with each side lobbying
the administration.

Competition: Larry Summers has been hotly tipped for the role as Federal Reserve Chairman but his candidature has been accompanied by strong criticism of his record in the Bill Clinton era

An openly waged succession battle is 
something that the Fed, which will turn 100 in December, has never 
before witnessed. The selection of a chairman has long been a matter 
handled privately by a president and his senior advisers.

In a statement Sunday, Obama said he had accepted Summers' decision.

'Larry
was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic 
crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because 
of his expertise, wisdom and leadership that we wrestled the economy 
back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,' Obama
said.

As director of the National Economic Council, Summers 
oversaw the administration's response to the economic and financial 
crisis early in Obama's first term.

Yet Summers faced strenuous 
opposition from some Democrats, including some on the Senate Banking 
Committee. Summers alluded to that opposition in a letter he sent Sunday
to Obama to formally withdraw from consideration.

'I have 
reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me 
would be acrimonious and would not serve the interests of the Federal 
Reserve, the administration or ultimately, the interests of the nation's
ongoing economic recovery,' Summers wrote.

Summers' ascent to 
the top of the list to succeed Bernanke rankled both opponents of the 
president as well as some liberal supporters. He has alienated 
colleagues in the past with a brusque and at times domineering style. 
Unlike Bernanke, he's not been known as a consensus-builder â€” one reason
some critics had opposed his nomination.

He was also seen as 
having been too cozy with Wall Street. And Summers was roundly 
criticized for questioning women's innate skills in math and science - 
comments that contributed to his forced resignation as Harvard's 
president in 2006.

Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of the women's 
rights group UltraViolet, welcomed Summers' withdrawal, saying she hopes
it serves as 'a reminder to all that sexism has no place anywhere in 
society and certainly not in the highest levels of our government.

Thomas
called on Obama to nominate Yellen, 67, who has been closely aligned 
with Bernanke and has helped devise the Fed's low-interest rates 
policies.

Since joining the Fed's board as vice chair in 2010, 
Yellen has supported Bernanke's use of not only the Fed's traditional 
tool of short-term interest rates but also non-traditional tools 
designed to help the economy. These include bond purchases and guidance 
to investors about the likely direction of rates.

Time up: Current Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's term is up in January

As early as 
this week, the Fed is expected to scale back its $85 billion-a-month in 
Treasury and mortgage bond purchases. Those purchases have been designed
to keep long-term loan rates low to get people to borrow and spend and 
invest in the stock market.

The low rates are credited with 
helping fuel a housing comeback, support economic growth, drive stocks 
to record highs and restore the wealth of many Americans.

Yellen 
has long been considered a top candidate for the chairmanship in part 
because of her expertise as an economist, her background as a top bank 
regulator and her experience as vice chair.

Last week, more than 
350 economists signed a letter to Obama calling on him to nominate 
Yellen. The letter was designed to draw attention back to Yellen amid 
signs that Obama was leaning toward Summers.

The letter, whose 
signers include economists with ties to Obama, credited Yellen for 
prescience in warning in 2005 about the impending mortgage meltdown, for
her consensus style of leadership and for her commitment to job growth.

Liberal
critics of Summers had focused in particular on the role he played in 
deregulating parts of the financial industry during the Clinton 
administration.

More than 20 Democratic senators this summer 
signed a letter to Obama expressing support for Yellen. The letter was 
circulated by Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a member of the Banking 
Committee.

Last week, another committee Democrat, Jon Tester of 
Montana, announced he would oppose Summers. Aides to Brown and to Senator 
Jeff Merkley of Oregon, also on the committee, indicated that their 
bosses intended to oppose Summers, too.

That meant Summers would have to win support from Republicans on the committee, a tough challenge.

Still,
a Yellen nomination would likely face resistance from many Republicans.
Critics argue that the Fed's low-rate policies have raised the risk of 
high inflation and dangerous bubbles in assets like real estate and 
stocks. Yellen is seen as a leading architect of those policies.

Obama had vigorously defended Summers in recent weeks, both in public comments and in closed-door meetings with lawmakers.

'I
will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on 
behalf of his country, and I look forward to continuing to seek his 
guidance and counsel in the future,' Obama said Sunday.
