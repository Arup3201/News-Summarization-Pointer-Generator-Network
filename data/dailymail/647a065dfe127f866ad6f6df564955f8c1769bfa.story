The brother of honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani today made an emotional appeal for her husband to be forced to 'tell the world' how she died.

With his sister's photograph pinned to his jacket, Anish Hindocha, 25, said Shrien Dewani should not be allowed to 'walk away' without revealing in his own words how she met her death.

Dewani, who has been on trial since early October accused of his wife's murder, has lodged a bid to be freed next week claiming there is insufficient evidence against him for the trial to continue and the charges should be thrown out.

Judge Jeanette Traverso will deliver her decision on Monday on whether she agrees that Dewani has no case to answer or whether there is enough evidence for the case to continue.

Despite glaring variations in his version of events leading up to, and after, his wife's fatal shooting two weeks after their wedding, Dewani is next week widely expected to be cleared of having any hand in it. 

But Anish, who has been supporting his parents in Cape Town since the first day of the trial, said: 'It would be a terrible development to what has been a four-year wait, if we and the people of South Africa are not afforded the full story.'

'Give us the full story': Shrien Dewani's brother Anish Hindocha (pictured, left, with his sister Ami Denborg, centre, and parents Vinod and Nilam Hindocha, behind, at a court hearing last year) made an emotional appeal for her husband to be forced to explain how she died

He said Dewani's counsel Francois Van Zyl had told the court repeatedly that the accused would explain to the court his version of events.

Anish said: 'The phrase "my client will tell the court" has become like a mantra to the judge, media and members of the public who have attended the Western Cape Court.

'Shrien Dewani has insisted all along that he would clear his name and his legal team have promised the court since the trial began dozens of times that he would help the court with his own version of events.

'Well, let's have him "tell the court" then. That has been his pledge throughout the trial.

'It would be wrong for him to walk away from South Africa without explaining himself what happened on the night of Anni's murder in this country.'  

Intention: The parents of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani, Vinod and Nilam Hindocha, say they will sue their accused son-in-law Shrien Dewani for not disclosing his bisexuality before marrying their daughter

Accused: Shrien Dewani (left) is charged with five counts relating to the kidnapping and murder of his wife of two weeks, Anni, (right) in a carjacking during their honeymoon to Cape Town in November 2010

He said Anni's family had been overwhelmed with support from well wishers who clearly wanted a full trial to be conducted.

'The people here have been, overall, fantastic in their support of us as Anni's family.

'We cannot thank them enough for the warmth they have shown us and we really appreciate it. Thousands of messages arrive through social media and other means and they mean a lot.

'But they also show that South Africa, after spending a vast amount of money, time and expertise on bringing Shrien Dewani to trial, is demanding the full story. 

Unaware: Nilam Hindocha, who is recovering from stomach cancer, said: 'If I knew Shrien was gay or bisexual I would never have allowed Anni to get married'

Back in court: Speaking for the first time since the trial began, Vinod  Hindocha (pictured) said he intends to pursue the civil action against Dewani in London, but stressed it was not financially motivated

Version: Anni's parents said they will struggle to find closure if they do not hear Shien Dewani (pictured earlier in the trial) giving evidence in court

'If the full facts are not given and by that I mean Shrien Dewani telling the court his version, than Anni's death will remain on the conscience of South Africa forever.

'It will also mean a lifetime of further torture for me and my family, particularly my parents.'

Anni's parents revealed to MailOnline earlier this week that they were unaware of their son-in-law's secret trysts with male prostitutes, including one called Leopold Leisser, which he confessed to on the first day of the trial while also admitting he was bisexual.

They declared they would not have agreed to the marriage and Anni herself would have walked away if the facts of his sexuality and meetings with male prostitutes had been revealed.

They are also set to examine taking legal action against him once the criminal case has been completed.

Anish added: 'There have been reports that we as a family are planning to take legal action of our own and sue Shrien Dewani after this murder trial is over. 

'This is not the right time to discuss this. However, our motivation is not, and never has been financial. We just demand the truth. 

'And we do that with heavy hearts after such a long time.'

Anni, who had been married less than a fortnight after their £200,000 wedding, died from a single gunshot to the neck as she was driven through Khayelitsha, part of a run-down suburb, with her husband in a taxi in November 2010.

Dewani was released unharmed, claiming he was pushed through the passenger rear window, but his wife was found dead the next day. 

Support: Ani's sister Ami Denborg (right) also said she wants the South African trial judge to ensure that Shrien Dewani explains his side of the story on how his wife Anni (left) was killed in November 2010

Trouble: Shrien Dewani (right) told Anni (left) he had fertility problems. The Cape Town murder trial has since heard how he went to Thailand for kick-boxing to help boost his testosterone levels

Three men were later jailed for the car jacking, but the trio said the murder was planned and two told the trial they were hired by Dewani, a wealthy businessman from Bristol.

The third has died from a brain tumour while serving his life sentence.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo said Dewani had offered him £1,400 to help organise the hit and enlist gangsters to carry out a staged hit on Anni.

Dewani, 34, was arrested soon after an extradition order was granted to take him back to South Africa to face trial. 

But he fought against his removal from Britain through the courts and was assessed as suffering from post traumatic shock and other mental health issues for three-and-a-half years. 

In the dark: Mr and Mrs Hindocha (pictured in Cape Town last week) revealed they were totally unaware that Dewani was bisexual and slept with gay prostitutes until details of his secret sex life were emerged in court

Claims: Police say Dewani (striped shirt) masterminded the murder of Anni (right), but he denies the charge accusing the three killers of concocting a yarn to reduce their own prison terms of at least 25 years

Shrien Dewani told the Cape Town court that he had hired a London prostitute, who went under the name The German Master (pictured), for sexual liaisons

He was returned in April by a private charter plane and is being detained in a secure hospital wing.

He denies any involvement in the murder and insists he has been set up by the killers and was deeply in love with his wife.

Mr Leisser and a senior Scotland Yard officer were banned by the judge from revealing details of Dewani's homosexual activities as they were about to give the evidence from the witness box.

Anish added: 'I fully expect the South African trail against Shrien Dewani to continue and for his application to end the case to be rejected.

'We have been made aware that there has been a petition against the judge in the this case and we would like to point out that it has nothing to do with our own case for justice and the full story we want.'

He made a direct plea to the court to hear the full evidence available and for the defence to put is case.

He added: 'Please allow us the opportunity to demand justice for my sister. Please allow us the full story.

'We don't want to return to our homes in the UK and Sweden carrying any doubts at all about whether Anni's murder received a fair and proper hearing in South Africa.

'We have been promised it for four painful years which have devastated our lives. I worry about my parents health and they need this closure.

'My message is simple. Don't let Shrien Dewani walk away without giving us, South Africa and people all over the world the full story.

'Let the law take its full and proper course.'   

Millionaire businessman Shrien Dewani (pictured arriving at court earlier in the trial) is said to have already packed his bags in the expectation that a judge will find in his favour over his claim that he should walk free because of a lack of evidence without being forced into the witness box and cross-examination
