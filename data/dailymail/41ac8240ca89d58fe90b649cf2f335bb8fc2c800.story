A husband was shot dead in a seemingly random murder-suicide on Tuesday while making his nightly phone call to his wife on his way to work.

Jamie Plymel, 40, was speaking to wife Stacy at a rest stop off Interstate 65 on the Kentucky border with Tennessee when he cried out: 'I've been shot!'

Mr Plymel, who has an eight-year-old son, was allegedly shot by James Roames, 39, who had been sitting at a picnic table at the rest stop with a gun.

Mr Plymel pulled in next to Roames in his car at 9.25pm while on his way to Owensboro, Kentucky, for a work appointment.

Roames reportedly asked him to turn off 
his headlights and Mr Plymel refused. The suspect then shot him, 
according to police, before taking his own life.

Mrs Plymel, who was traveling to nearby Murfreesboro, turned her car around and raced to the rest stop, The Tennessean reported. 

On arrival, she found that her husband had died.

Police are investigating the motive behind the seemingly random murder-suicide and speaking to Roames' family about his recent mental state.  

Trooper Jonathan Biven said: 'It's just a random tragedy. It's just a single act.'

Mr Plymel, of Spring Hill, Tennessee, was
 pronounced dead at Franklin Medical Center in Simpson County, Kentucky.

Roames of Hendersonville, Tennessee, died at Skyline Medical Center in Nashville.

Biven
 said investigators believe Plymel and Roames did not know each other 
and are unsure what prompted the shooting at the welcome center along 
the northbound lanes of Interstate 65.

A neighbor of Roames told Wave3 that the man lived with his elderly parents and was 'hermit-like'.

The investigation is ongoing.
