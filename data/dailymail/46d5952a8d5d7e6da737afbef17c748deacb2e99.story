With long blonde hair, 32DD breasts and slender figure, Carolyn Anderson, 28, from Liverpool, is could easily be mistaken for Pamela Anderson at first glance.

And for extreme Pammie fan Carolyn, that couldn't be more of a compliment. Indeed, so obsessed with the Baywatch star is she, she's spent 14 years and £20,000 on a mission to look more like the blonde actress.

Now, however, she claims she's an improvement on the star and says that the 46-year-old actress ought to be flattered to be told she looks like Carolyn.

Carolyn's quest for surgical perfection has so far seen her have nine breast operations, including several to correct a botched boob job, botox, teeth whitening and lip filler.

I grew up with Baywatch and I was 
captivated by her [Pamela Anderson's] look,' explains Carolyn. 'She's like an iconic cartoon
 character in human form.'

Her mission to look more like the star began at the age of 14, when she dyed her hair blonde and a throwaway comment from her father kickstarted what would become an enduring obsession.

'I dyed my hair blonde and he said: "oh
 you don't half look like Pamela Anderson with your hair that colour",' she remembers.

'And from there, a lot of other people seemed to start saying it.'

Her first surgery swiftly followed, although as Carolyn admits, her quest to become the Scouse Pamela Anderson hasn't always gone smoothly.

'I had my first boob job was when I was 20 just
 to make me feel more confident but unfortunately, it went wrong.

'I realised after a 
couple of months that they weren't placed right and one started to go hard.'

But instead of seeing the doctor, Carolyn ignored the issue and continued to spend plenty of time on the sunbed - with disastrous consequences.

'I was addicted to having a Pammie style tan,' she confesses. 'At the height of my sunbed use, I 
would be on it four times a week for up to 16 minutes. At times, my skin would feel
 red raw.' 

The best: Carolyn says she's also an improvement on the original by virtue of being from Liverpool

For her breasts, already delicate and dotted with scar tissue because of the implants, the excessive sunbed use proved enormously damaging.

'I started to see abrasions on one side of the breast and the 
skin was raw. I could see the implant showing on the outside - it had become badly infected.'

She continues: 'I
 had complications on my left breast. It was infected from the inside 
out so I had to have the implant removed.

'For three months, I walked around with 
only one breast implant. It was very strange to me because it was 
something I'd never felt before. It was was very embarrassing the first 
time it happened.

'You don't want to date someone because you're 
basically walking round with one breast.'

Eventually, the infection spread to the right breast as well and she was forced to have the other implant removed.

'I
 had to have an operation to remove it, operation to drain it and operation to put it back in... I
 had around eight operations in total.'

But despite the complications, Carolyn says she's still not satisfied. 'I'd like to go a size or two up,' she admits. 'Then I'd
 be happy to maintain that look.'

'It's a
 full time job to keep looking this good,' she adds. 'To be this obsessed with one's
 appearance would seem extreme but I am willing to do what ever it takes
 to maintain that character.

'It's like, I'm the real Pamela Anderson - 
that's what it feels like anyway.'

Despite her efforts, she admits she's rarely confused with her idol, although she blames that on Pamela's age.

'I don't think I'll ever be mistaken 
for the real Pamela Anderson. I think its a compliment to the real 
Pamela Anderson that she looks like me know, because she's pushing 40!

Smiling, she concludes: 'I'm the world's best Pamela Anderson lookalike but I'm one better because I'm the Scouse version.'

The real Pamela Anderson might have something to say about that.
