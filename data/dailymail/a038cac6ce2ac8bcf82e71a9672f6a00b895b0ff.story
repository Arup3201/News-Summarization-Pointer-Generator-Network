Days ago she was unveiled as the star of Burberry's new fragrance campaign and now she is showcasing her never-ending legs for shoe brand UGG: it's all in a week's work for 2014's hottest model Suki Waterhouse.

The
 22-year-old model - and gorgeous girlfriend of actor Bradley Cooper - has 
been unveiled as the new face and feet of UGG Australia.

The British model 
and actress manages to inject some of her effortless cool into the fluffy boots as she poses in slouchy loungewear with kohl-rimmed eyes.

Another fashion campaign? Suki Waterhouse is sure making her mark on the fashion world - her latest campaign sees her posing for UGG Australia

Suki is joined by another fashion heavyweight, model Chloe Norgaard, who is known for her rainbow locks, as well as fashion director Natalie 
Hartley, blogger Bip Ling and designers Agi & Sam in the UGG Creative Council - a group of 
fashion faces who've joined forces to add 'creative spirit' to the new 
campaign.

The 22-year-old has already served as a clothes horse for the likes of Benetton, Uniqlo and Forever 21, and is expected to be a star of the the global fashion weeks which kick off in New York in a few days time.

Suki is no stranger to 
high-end fashion campaigns and began her modelling career after being 
discovered in a pub in London at the tender age of 16.

Her first major campaign was for 
M&S lingerie aged 19 and she has since modelled for the likes ofÂ  
alice + olivia, H&M, Pepe Jeans and Coast.

As well as a successful career, Suki is also having some luck in her love life.

She has been dating Hollywood heartthrob Bradley Cooper for a year now - and it seems they are closer than ever.

After
snuggling at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and strolling 
hand-in-hand around Sundance this month, the pair piled on the PDA once 
again last week.

The couple were seen sharing a kiss after watching the Justin Timberlake concert in Inglewood, California.

And the Mail On Sunday reported this weekend that the hard-partying blonde has given up drinking at the request of 39-year-old Bradley, who has been sober for over ten years.
