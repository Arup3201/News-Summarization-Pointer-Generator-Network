A college student has sparked outrage by posting a sexist blog in which he says the only way to get a woman to tell the truth is to get her naked.

The blog post - called 'What I've learned about Women' was posted on Wednesday by Thor Lund, a former student government president at the University of Texas at Austin.

His post begins by explaining just how much he loves women. He says: 'I love women, a lot. I love when they look at me, talk to me, and laugh at me. '

However, it quickly takes a much darker 
turn when Mr Lund says that if you take all a woman's clothes off, she will be
truthful with you.

Fury: college student Thor Lund has sparked outrage by posting a sexist blog in which he says the only way to get a woman to tell the truth is to get her naked

He said: 'The thing I love most about women and trying to convince them to kiss me is that at the core of it, if you can get a girl over to your place and somehow manage to have her take her clothes off, she will be truthful with you.

'It is hard to lie to someone who is lying naked next to you. Girls are lying all day long. They lie about their feelings, their weight, how much cardio they did, and what they think of their best friends oversized purse. 

'But at the end of the day, when I get a girl back to my place, she will tell the truth about what she wants to do when she grows up, what her family is like, what her city is like, and why she has that stupid oversized purse. '

He then goes on to explain his 'rules for women' in which he even attributes his own name to a quote.

His blog reads: 'When you realise women make absolutely no sense, it all makes sense. - Thor Ericson Lund.'

Controversial: This is how Mr Lund began his blog, which he called 'What I've learned about women'

His other golden nuggets of information include 'Your only goal is to have fun' and 'Stop trying'.

Mr Lund then helfully suggests to his readers that there are just three places you should look at a woman.

He says: 'The first is her eyes, because
you can tell if she is interested in you or not with the eyes. The 
second is her neck because it is the most sensitive part of her body and
you want to check for an adams apple.

'If she has one of those, she is most likely a man so you should avoid trying to sleep with her/him.

'The third and most important place you 
can look at a woman is her toes. Why? Because the toes tell all. If her 
feet are pretty and her nails are painted then you can assume the rest 
of her body is well groomed and cleaned.'

Sorry: Mr Lund issued this apology following the outcry which his blog caused

Following this, he also offers flirting advice to his male readers.

'So the best way to think about women and how to get them to be attracted to you is to do the exact opposite of what you think.

'If you really like her, tell her you
can't stand her. If you think she is pretty, make fun of her oversized 
purse and ask her if she keeps a parachute inside it.

'If
she is the nicest girl you've ever met, tell her that you don't like it
that she is so mean to young children. Seriously its so simple, do the 
opposite.'

He says: 'The final piece of advice I have for talking to girls is to confuse them.

Foolish: Mr Lund is a former student government president at the University of Texas at Austin, pictured

'Honestly they deserve it, they have 
perplexed men since the beginning of time when they tricked us to eat 
the devil's food in the garden of eden.

'Give them a taste of their own medicine. If you can confuse their brain, then they will go home with you. Again, I don't know why and it doesn't make sense but it just does.'

Following a storm of Twitter outrage over his post, Mr Lund took down the blog on Thursday.

As reported by the Huffington Post, he said: 'I have removed the blog post because it cost me one of my closest friendships with a woman who in unlike any other on the face of this planet.

'She has done more for me that anyone besides my mother. I offended her, I am ashamed, and I am sorry.'
