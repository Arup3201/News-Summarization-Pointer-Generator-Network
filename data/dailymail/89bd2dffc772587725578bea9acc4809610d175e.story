Britian's most northerly fish and chippie, in the far-flung outreaches of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, has been crowned UK's best. 

Frankie's Fish & Chips, which opened in 2008 in Brae, Shetland, beat nine other regional finalists to take the title at the 2015 National Fish and Chip Awards. 

The only chippie within a 25-mile radius, the family-owned business is open seven days a week and serves specials such as scallops, squid, mussels and crab alongside its usual fare.

Frankie's owner Valerie Johnson said: 'We now get to go home to Shetland and say that our fish and chips are the best in Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales - without exception. How amazing is that?'

'This is the highlight of my working life. I can't thank (the organisers) Seafish and my brilliant team enough. You're a credit to the seafood industry. 2015 is Frankie's year.'

Simpson's Fish & Chips in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire nabbed second place whilst Papa's Barn in Ditton Kent was nabbed third.

The final 10 places were shortlisted during earlier rounds which included unannounced shop visits by industry judges.

Competitors were assessed on a variety of criteria including product quality, sustainable sourcing policies, marketing initiatives and customer service.

Paul Williams, chief executive of trade body Seafish, said: 'Every year we see new and established talent vie for the top title, and the competition gets fiercer each year.

'This year was no exception and the judges were faced with a particularly tricky job in determining a winner.

'Frankie's Fish & Chips stood out throughout the judging process. Their passion and determination has to be admired.

'The standards of entrants across all award categories improves year on year. 

Unwavering commitment to the industry and the efforts made towards responsible sourcing and maintaining standards are vital in ensuring future generations can enjoy the nation's favourite dish.'
