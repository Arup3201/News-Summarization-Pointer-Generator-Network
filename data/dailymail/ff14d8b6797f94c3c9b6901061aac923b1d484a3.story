The grand jury deliberating over the shooting death of Michael Brown will not make a decision until at least Monday, it has emerged, as the 18-year-old's mother has begged protesters to stay peaceful.

The secret panel, which is deciding whether to indict officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting the unarmed black teenager in Ferguson on August 9, had planned to reach a decision on Friday night.

However, according to Downtown STL Inc, a St. Louis civic group, the decision could come late next week as the 12 civilians plan to reconvene on Monday to deliberate further.

It is unclear how the firm gleaned the information from the closed-door Missouri hearing, before sharing it in an email to business partners on Saturday afternoon.

Waiting: Anthony Gray, attorney for Michael Brown's family, has not been informed of an imminent decision in Michael's case. The grand jury may not make a decision until at least Monday, it was revealed on Saturday

Ben Crump, one of the Brown family's attorneys, said the jury had initially planned to work over the weekend if Friday's deadline fell through. He confirmed no conclusion had been reached. 

The delay was revealed as Michael's mother, Lesley McSpadden, urged a crowd of demonstrators gathered along Canfield Drive - just feet away from where her son was killed - to avoid violence.

In an emotional plea via megaphone, she told protesters on Saturday night: 'I just want y'all to be careful. Don't agitate them, don't let them agitate y'all. I don't want nobody getting hurt.

'We all willing to do something, but I don't want nobody getting hurt, see what I'm saying? Because when it's time to walk into the courtroom, I want all y'all with me.'

She also asked demonstrators to 'keep the faith', despite the majority of supporters expecting the charges against Wilson to be dropped, according to a video obtained by the Huffington Post.

And she said she was speaking out on 'behalf of everybody who was affected' by her son's death.

Some protesters then marched down West Florissant Avenue for the second time that evening, passing boarded-up storefronts and chanting: 'Rain, sleet, hail, snow, hell no, we won’t go.'

Earlier on Saturday, grenade-wielding militia and almost 100 FBI agents  lined the streets of Ferguson in bullet-proof cars to prepare for potential turmoil when the verdict is made public.

A police force which helped patrol the streets of Ferguson during protests over the killing of Michael Brown is kitted out with grenade launchers and military-grade vehicles.

The lethal arsenal of the St Louis Police Department, which sent forces to the Missouri city during fraught demonstrations this year, also includes mobile riot shields, Tasers and an extensive array of conventional firearms.

Police officers armaments, often provided by the Federal government under a scheme to re-use old army equipment, have been under increased scrutiny after shocking images of heavily-armed officers emerged in the wake of Michael's death.

The new list of equipment was revealed to BuzzFeed News under freedom of information laws, and details all significant equipment acquired by the police force since 2004.

Worrying entries in the arsenal of the force, which is responsible for just over 300,000 people, include two PGL-65 multi-shot grenade launchers, from which one officer can fire six canisters in a matter of seconds without reloading.

Freeze: Conventional firearms populated most of the list, but more exotic weapons and vehicles also feature

The pump-action weapons were seen on the streets of Ferguson firing tear gas rounds, but can also launch flash bangs, non-lethal foam rounds, and traditional 40mm explosive grenades.

The police department also has access to a 1969 Hughes MH-6C helicopter, which can have mini-guns, rockets and anti-tank missile attached. It also has two other helicopters.

Dozens of pistols and rifles were also included in the load-out - as was a powerful 'acoustic device' which can fire deafening noises into crowds.

Defensive equipment for the police included dozens of thick riot shields and a BearCat armored personnel carrier which is strong enough to withstand a blast from a land mine.

Proponents of the mass buy-up of lethal technology has said that a well-armed police force can help shut down potentially dangerous confrontations.

However, critics say it creates an overly aggressive force which is more able - and likely - to inflict harm on the population.

On August 20 in Ferguson a police officer, Ray Albers, was suspended after pointing an assault rifle at a Ferguson protester and reportedly threatening to kill.
