Floyd Mayweather mocked British boxer Amir Khan in his post-fight press conference, but conceded that he could fight the Bolton-born fighter next.

Mayweather saw off Argentine Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas on Saturday night, and could finally meet Manny Pacquiao in his next fight.

But the American admitted that fighting Khan at Wembley is still an option, despite unfavourably comparing Khan's record to his own.

'Amir Khan is a solid, good competitor, he's a good fighter,' said Mayweather. 'We don't know who I'm fighting right now, we don't really know.'

'I'm not rushing. If that fight happened to come my way then we'll make it happen.

Asked if he was showing signs of aging, Mayweather joked 'I felt good. I can't really say what age I felt, I felt like the winner.'

'But Amir Khan's a good fighter, of course. I mean I think when Amir Khan was an amateur, I was champion. And then when Amir Khan turned pro and got knocked out, I was champion.

Then when Amir Khan got knocked out again I was champion. And then when he lost his belt again I'm still champion and I'm still right here.'
