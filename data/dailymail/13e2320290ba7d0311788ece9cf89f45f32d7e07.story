The retiring chief executive of drinks giant Diageo is set to be given the most generous leaving present in British corporate history.

Paul Walsh, 58, is receiving a £46million thank you for his 13 years at the head of the Guinness owners.

As if this was not enough of a bonus, last year Mr Walsh made £11.2 million, making him one of the best-paid bosses of all FTSE 100 companies.

Mr Walsh also sold shares in Diageo worth £16.4 million last month after cashing in options.

As well as £15.5million in shares, Mr Walsh also a pension pot worth £19.2million and options over stock worth around £11.7 million.

Although the share options are tied to the company’s performance, Mr Walsh may run a low risk of making any losses.

Last August Diageo reported an overall rise in annual sales to £10.8 billion as profits surged thanks to a strong performance in the US.

sells to 180 countries.

Mr Walsh, who has led the drinks group 
since 2000, oversaw the expansion of Diageo worldwide, purchasing drinks
branks in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Africa.

He will hand over to new chief executive Ivan Menezes in July and is due to remain with Diageo for a year-long transition period before retiring.

Mr Walsh began his career with Grand Metropolitan in 1982.

The drinks company merged with Guinness in 1997 to create Diageo and he became chief executive in 2000.

Described as 'Tony Soprano in spectacles' by the Sunday Times, he recently married his long-term partner, PR executive Julie Lewis.

Despite his major pay package and generous goodbye, Mr Walsh claimed in a 2007 interview to live a 'relatively modest life'.

As well as a 20acre property in West Sussex, Mr Walsh also has a penthouse in Chelsea and a stake in a 2,400 acre game ranch in South Africa.

Diageo, which describes itself as the world's leading premium drinks business, employs 25,000 people around the world.
