The first Homira Baryalei heard that her son was an extreme Islamic terrorist was when the Australian Federal Police turned up on her doorstep in Sydney.

Mohammed Ali Baryalei told his mother he was going to study in Turkey but it was during a police raid that she was told the shocking truth that her son was fighting in Syria.

Despite her son proclaiming his innocence to his mother, the cold harsh reality unfolded as Mrs Baryalei continued to receive visits from ASIO and the police over the coming months.

A warrant was put out for his arrest as it emerged Baryalei was recruiting fighters to the Islamic State's cause in Syria.

'To be questioned and asked and probed and prodded about this, how do we move on from our lives?' asked another of Baryalei's close relatives, who asked not to be named, told The Australian.

'We haven't even done anything. I feel like we're guilty by association.'

Homira Baryalei arrived in Australia more than 30 years ago as a young refugee from Afghanistan and raised four children in Sydney's northwest.

Unbeknownst to his mother, Baryalei chose to leave the peaceful suburban streets to join terror group Jabhat al-Nusra then the Islamic State.

Three weeks ago, Mohammed Baryalei was named by police as the instigator behind a plot to behead a member of the public in an Australian city which was to be filmed with the victim draped in the Islamic State's black flag.

'Why I run away from Afghanistan? I come to a peaceful country. I am living in this area 25 years or more and I'm very peaceful,' his mother said to The Australian.

'I'm say hello to everyone. I go shopping. I come to visit my kids. That's it.'

Baryalei grew up with three siblings in Sydney's northwest

Mrs Baryalei said her son's conversion to radical Islam came after a period of drinking and taking drugs when he worked as a doorman at a Kings Cross strip club.

He then entered a stable relationship and returned to Islam, working with the Street Dawah movement, a group of Muslims who recruited on the streets of western Sydney.

This was when he began to complain of being harassed on the streets and decided he wanted to study in Egypt.

'This time, though, Egypt was very bad. That's why he said, "I go to Turkey first. I want to see how much it costs me in university, I find good job. I go for two, three years, I want to study about Islam".' 

But the 33-year-old went to Syria instead.

Mrs Baryalei asked if her son would ever be able to come home.

'I ask Ali, he said, "Mum, I'm not coming. They put me in the jail. Why I'm coming? I'm free here", ' Ms Baryalei said.

'After that, I don't think Ali (will) come back … For my life, I lost my son, for my whole life.'
