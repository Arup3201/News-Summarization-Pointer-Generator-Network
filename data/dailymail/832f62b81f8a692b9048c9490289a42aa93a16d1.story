A serial bride traded two seven-month-old malnourished puppies for a plasma TV, it emerged today.

Alison Smith - who was married four times by the age of 24, and has since married again - swapped her TV to get two Staffordshire bull terriers from her stepfather, who was also her first husband.

The 31-year-old mother-of-two from Arbroath, near Dundee, was reported to authorities by Angus Dog Rescue, who accused her of leaving puppies Snowy and Patch just days away from death.

The charity took away the puppies 
after Mrs Smith called to ask them to deliver free dog food, and were 
horrified when they discovered the poor condition of the animals, who 
were ‘alive with fleas’.

Heather
Robb, of Angus Dog Rescue, said: ‘We went round to Alison Smith’s house
to check the condition of the dogs. It was so distressing to see them. 
They were almost starved to death.

‘They
were about half the weight they should have been. You could see the 
bones sticking out. They were filthy. Their coats were all matted. Their
coats and paws and caked with dog mess.’

But
as Mrs Robb and her husband Ian, chairman of Angus Dog Rescue, were 
making arrangements to remove the puppies - another dog jumped out of 
the house and attacked her.

Concern: Ian Robb, chairman of Angus Dog Rescue, described the puppies' condition as 'heartbreaking' and confirmed the matter had been reported to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

She added: ‘The door to the flat opened and a cross boxer-bull mastiff attacked me. It latched on to my arm. I needed to go to hospital and have the wounds treated. My arm is a right mess.’

Probe: Alison Smith was a bridesmaid for her mother and ex-husband after forgiving them for splitting up her marriage just 10 days after the ceremony

Ian Robb described the puppies’ condition as ‘heartbreaking’ and confirmed the matter had been reported to Angus Council and the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA).

‘We have had problems with this family for quite a few years,’ he said. ‘We usually get the dogs after they have been totally ruined and are out of control.

‘Luckily, we have got these two while they are still young and should get new homes for them within a month or so.’

Mrs Smith was a bridesmaid for her mother and ex-husband after forgiving them for splitting up her marriage just 10 days after the ceremony.

She said the two mistreated dogs seemed healthy when they arrived at her bottom-floor flat but quickly deteriorated in the three weeks she claimed to have had them.

Mrs Smith said: ‘How are you supposed to feed four dogs on £60 a week? I only wanted one. I couldn’t afford to keep them so I asked if they (Angus Dog Rescue) could come and re-home them.

‘We fed them but the other dogs kept taking their food. I was trying to share the tins between the dogs.’

The incident was part of a report to the SSPCA, whose chief inspector Brian Cowing said: ‘We received a call regarding concerns for the welfare of dogs at an address in Arbroath. Our inquiries into this matter are ongoing.’
