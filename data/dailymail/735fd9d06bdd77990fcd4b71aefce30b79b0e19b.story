The Polish military dictator who led the crackdown on the Solidarity movement in the 1980s has been threatened with divorce after allegedly having sex with his nurse.

General Wojciech Jaruzelski, 90, was caught by his wife Barbara, 84, in a ‘compromising position’ with his carer under his blanket.

Mrs Jaruzelska claimed her husband had been seduced by the woman, named only as ‘Dorota W.’ in the Polish media for legal reasons, after she brought him delicacies and put on high heels.

‘I prepared all the paperwork with my lawyer four months ago,’ Mrs Jaruzelska said. ‘If my husband does not get rid of that woman, I will go to court to file for divorce.’  

She added: ‘He accused me of having lost my mind, which is absolutely not the case.’

In an interview with Polish newspaper Super Express, Mrs Jaruzelska said Dorota W., who is in her 50s, has been employed by the Jaruzelskis for five years at a rate of 15 zloty (£3) per hour, and visited on an almost daily basis.

Mrs Jaruzelska described Dorota W. as ‘disgusting’ and a ‘schemer’ who exaggerated her poverty, leading the ‘gullible’ general to share his pension with her. 

On one occasion, a security guard said Dorota W. should leave because she had vomited in the house after a drinking binge, leading Mrs Jaruzelska to brand her an alcoholic.

The carer allegedly manipulated the family into having rows, and burst into a fit of tears when threatened with the sack.

‘She would wait for me to leave, and then immediately run to my husband’s room and put her head under his blanket,’ Mrs Jaruzelska said.

‘I don’t know if I don’t love him, I am in grief that he allowed her to be in our house,’ she said.

Jaruzelski is already viewed as a traitor by many of his compatriots, because of his role in the imposition of army rule in the 1980s that led to the bloody crackdown of the anti-communist Solidarity movement of Lech Walesa.

The general has defended the decision as a way of averting an imminent Soviet invasion.

Some historians say it was one of the most dangerous episodes of the Cold War, which could eventually have led to the use of nuclear weapons in Europe.

In 1989, Jaruzelski finally gave in to Solidarity, which prompted democratic elections in Poland and a domino effect across Europe, as the other communist regimes fell.   

Jaruzelski has been receiving chemotherapy in hospital for three years after being diagnosed with cancer of the lymphatic system.
