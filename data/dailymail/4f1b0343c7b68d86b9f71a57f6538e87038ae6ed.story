He may be more famous for his kooky topknot and feather earrings than his rippling abs, but Ollie Proudlock has beaten his skinny genes by transforming his body from scrawny to brawny in just six weeks.

And now, the Made In Chelsea star is sharing the secrets behind his 6kg lean muscle mass gain in his new fitness book.

Ollie, 25, has radically transformed his body - adding 6kg (13lbs) of lean muscle mass - by following an intense health and fitness regime for six weeks.

The regime was such a success, that Men's Health decided to feature Ollie alongside his other MIC castmates for a feature on transforming their bodies.

Scrawny to brawny: Ollie Proudlock, of Made In Chelsea and top knot fame, has gained 6kg of muscle mass and is releasing a tell-all book

'I’d always wanted to improve my muscles, especially on my upper body, but I’d never had much success, probably because I wasn’t training and eating the right way,’ Ollie - aka Prooders - told MailOnline.

‘Finding the right personal trainer who could give me the right training and diet advice made such a difference. I could see changes almost straight away.

'I love my new physique, not only because I am stronger and leaner, but because I have renewed focus and energy to apply to all the other areas of my life. It’s been such a positive experience that I want to share it with others!'.

The plan uses a cycled diet that harnesses the power of your own hormones and gives detailed instructions on what to eat to help bulk up your body.

It also promises to provide a breakdown of how to do every exercise, rest intervals, and repetition goals, as well as key muscle building supplements so you can reach your goal faster.

Linguine: Ollie's trainer described his power as akin to 'wet linguine' - but not anymore

‘Oliver was was possibly the worst candidate you could pick for a rapid muscle-gaining transformation,’ explains trainer Nick Mitchell, founder of Ultimate Performance.

‘At 5ft 10in (178cm) and just 9st 6lbs (59.8kg), Oliver was extremely lean: his upper arms were the size of my wrists.

'He is a classic ectomorph and perfect for long-distance cardio but with the explosive power output of wet linguini.

As he was: At 5ft 10in (178cm) and just 9st 6lbs (59.8kg), Ollie's body has changed a lot in the past 6 weeks and these before shots prove that. Full interview appears in the January/February issue of Men's Health, on sale now (R)

'But Oliver’s can-do attitude was paramount to his success. He worked out like a warrior, as his incredible results prove.’

The Six Week Muscle Plan, which is £9.99 from Amazon, contains the complete six week training programme, as well as a nutrition and supplement guide that Ollie used.
