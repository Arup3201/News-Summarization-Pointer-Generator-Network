A mother and her five children were badly burned after a gas leak caused their house to explode.

Sanjuanita Rodriguez and her five children, aged between three and 18, climbed out of the front window of their Dallas house early yesterday morning and were all taken to hospital with injuries.

Firefighters were called to a single-story home in Oak Cliff, Texas, at 6.05am and when they arrived the home was engulfed in flames, according to Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans.

A gas leak is thought to have caused the house explosion in Dallas that injured a woman and five children

Sanjuanita Rodriguez and her five children, aged between three and 18, climbed out of the front window of their house in Texas and were all taken to hospital badly burned and with other injuries 

Speaking from Parkland Memorial Hospital, Mrs Rodriguez said that everyone is alright, but that they lost everything in the fire.

'I'm grateful to God no one died in that fire,' she said.

The mother's condition appeared to be the most severe, with burns covering most of her body, according to officials.

Her husband, Martin, was working at a nearby store when the house exploded and burst into flames.

Mrs Rodriguez said that everyone is alright, but that they lost everything in the fire. She said: 'I'm grateful to God no one died in that fire' 

Their 11-year-old son has already has surgery for the burns and his 17-year-old brother was in a critical condition.

An eight-year-old girl has burns on her hands and an 18-year-old man has burns to his legs, but the three-year-old girl escaped with the least severe injuries.

Neighbours reported smelling gas in the hours before the explosion and said they rushed outside after hearing a loud boom to find the home on fire.

Sara Rodriguez, 13, was standing in her kitchen making a sandwich when she heard an explosion. 

The teenager, who is not related to the victims, grabbed her mobile phone and started recording the inferno as she raced outside. 

'I saw people screaming, yelling and I was like shocked,' she said.

'It sounded like  a bomb or something. It came towards us.'

One neighbour said he saw all six family members climb out of the window and that one of the boys pulled his sister out of the house just before he heard a second explosion.

Howard Jenkins said: 'His oldest son managed to get his sister out of the front window. Everybody got out that window.

'When they made it across the street, the house exploded. It was a matter of seconds. If they hadn't gotten out of there when they did we wouldn't have just had legs burned.'

'We woke up to a loud explosion. We thought a car hit a pole. When we came out, we saw the house engulfed.'

A Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman said the Tuesday morning blast was accidental in nature and resulted from a leak inside the house.
