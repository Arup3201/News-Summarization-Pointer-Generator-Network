The bombastic gubernatorial candidate who went viral with the message that the rent was too-damn-high is now facing eviction. 

Jimmy McMillan's landlord is trying to boot him from his $872-a-month rent stabilized apartment in the East Village. 

In response, McMillan has filed a suit in Brooklyn Federal Court seeking to hold off the February 5 eviction.

The eviction is scheduled to be enacted by the city marshal. 

McMillan, who founded The Rent Is Too Damn High political party, is also asking $1.3 million in monetary damages. 

McMillan, 68, has long battled with the landlord who claimed that the one-bedroom on St. Marks Place was not the primary residence of the 68-year-old Vietnam vet.

The landlord claims McMillan really lives in Brooklyn. 

McMillan is associated with a Brooklyn address but he claims it is only an office.  

'They don't have the authority to evict me,' McMillan told the Daily News.

He further contends that Lisco Holdings LLC refused to comply with a Housing Court order in 2009 to give him a new key. 

'They never gave me a damn key,' McMillan said. 

He also claims the landlord has refused to takes his rent checks as they try and push low-paying tenants out of the building. 

'The (St. Marks Place) rent doesn’t have anything to do with my movement,' McMillan said.

If he is evicted, McMillan said he has no clue where he'd go.
