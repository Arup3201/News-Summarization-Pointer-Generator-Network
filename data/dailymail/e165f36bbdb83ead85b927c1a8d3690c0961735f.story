MPs today launched a bid for ‘Black Friday’ discounts to be scrapped to stop further ‘scenes of disorder’ as desperate shoppers fight each other for the best bargains.

A Commons motion has been laid slamming retailers for offering ‘huge discounts’ on the last Friday of November – kick-starting the Christmas shopping season.

The motion, signed by three MPs, claims the knock-down prices caused ‘scenes of disorder in some stores as many police had to attend to prevent or break up fights in stores, whilst other stores were forced to close’.

‘Many shoppers suffered injuries due to the level of public disorder caused by this event,’ it adds. The MPs call on ‘all UK retailers not to mark this event in 2015 or again’.

It comes after shoppers an estimated £810million on Black Friday last year – November 28 – making it the biggest ever day for UK online sales.

The shopping boom caused retailers to suffer their slowest December growth in six years after Black Friday spending disrupted the ‘timing and rhythm’ of Christmas sales.

Liberal Democrat Greg Mulholland criticised large traders for adopting the American custom and sympathised with police officers who said they had ‘enough to do already’.

Conservative former minister Sir Peter Bottomley joined with Mr Mulholland to urge UK retailers to ignore the event in 2015 and beyond.

Police were called to stores around the country as the Black Friday sales descended into chaos.

Incidents included people fighting over televisions at Asda in Wembley and officers intervening after 200 people refused to leave a Tesco Extra store in the Manchester area despite being told it was sold out.

Mr Mulholland has put forward the idea of a UK boycott in an early day motion tabled before Parliament.

An EDM is a formal motion submitted for debate in the House of Commons although very few are actually debated.
