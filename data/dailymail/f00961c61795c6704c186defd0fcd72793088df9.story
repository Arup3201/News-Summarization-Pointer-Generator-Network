It had stood through war, pestilence and more than 1,200 years of whatever the British weather could throw at it.

But now a historic tree believed to be the oldest oak in the land has finally been brought crashing down.

The Pontfadog Oak was felled by 55mph gales that hit North Wales on Wednesday night.

Collapse: Pontfadog Oak tree which has stood since the year 802 after it fell in the early hours of Thursday morning

Debris: The tree fell as wind speed approached 60mph in areas near Chirk, north Wales

Conservationists had repeatedly called for the ancient tree, which had a 42ft girth, to be supported so it could be preserved by future generations.

But the £5,700 cost was considered too high, so nothing was done to protect the sessile oak.

It had grown at Chirk, near Wrexham, since at least 802AD – although some claim it may have been 1,600 years old.

Welsh Prince Owain Gwynedd rallied his army beneath its branches in 1157, before defeating Henry II at the battle of Crogen.

Inspection: The Pontfadog Oak collapsed after it was recommended that work should be carried out to preserve it

Legend has it that the tree was spared when Henry had his men cut down the surrounding woods in 1165 and its huge hollow trunk was said to be large enough to seat six people.

Woodland Trust conservation adviser Jill Butler said: ‘This venerable old tree has had a lot to cope with over the past few weeks, with heavy snow, a prolonged cold snap and finally high winds.

‘But the Woodland Trust believes that this sad case illustrates how we are failing to provide adequate protection for our ancient trees at present.’

Wreckage: Experts said the tree collapse was completely unexpected but comes after it has been battered by both snow and strong winds in recent weeks

Historic: It measured a staggering 12.9metres across and was big enough to sit six people inside its enormous hollow trunk

Damage: The owner of the tree, Diane Coakley-Williams, said that not enough had been done to help preserve it

The winds that hit most of the UK this week have now died down with mild and dry weather forecast for today and tomorrow. The South and South East of England should see some sunshine.

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘We are looking at a pleasant weekend, with temperatures two or three degrees warmer than the seasonal average.

‘The best of the weather may not come till next Tuesday, when it could hit 18C (64F) in London.’

I'm their new nanny: Goat adopts two lambs rejected by their mother

A goat has taken two lambs who were rejected by their mother under her wing.

The lambs were born nearly three weeks ago at White Post Farm in Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire.

When their mother rejected them, Geraldine the Golden Guernsey goat adopted them.

The farm has now launched a Facebook page inviting visitors to suggest names for the lambs.

Anthony Moore, one of the managers at the farm, said: 'It’s so strange to see her looking after the lambs but the three of them have really bonded and get on really well.

'We were worried at first because the first few days are critical and the lambs need the nutrients from their mother’s milk. Luckily, Geraldine was more than happy to adopt and feed them.

'Now they walk around the farm together and the two lambs never leave Geraldine’s side. They make a really nice little family.'

Mr Moore said Geraldine had a male kid earlier this year so is no stranger to motherhood.

'We thought we would try Geraldine when the lambs’ mother rejected them. The Golden Guernsey breed is very friendly and laid back.

'It’s lovely to go in their shed in the morning and see this golden orange-coloured goat with two small black lambs snuggled up by her side.

'Outside, you’ll see them sat on top of Geraldine just as they would their normal mother - it’s a very strange but lovely sight.'
