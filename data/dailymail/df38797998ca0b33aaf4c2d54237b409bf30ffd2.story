X Factor has been criticised for its 'shameless' product placement on the first live show of the series.

The show's contestants were filmed repeatedly plugging Samsung products during their video diaries, including using the Galaxy phones to talk to their celebrity mentors.

The five-star luxury hotel where they are staying at in London was also featured countless times, leading to a flood of anger on social networking site Twitter.

Samsung Electronics is the first company the long-running reality TV series has had a paid-for product placement agreement with, following changes made by Ofcom last year.

And last night the show certainly didn't hold back in showing finalists using the latest Samsung products.

Viewers took to Twitter to express their views about the show's repeated product placement, as during the contestant's video diaries they were captured plugging the newest models.

One viewer wrote: 'That was a fun hour of x-factor amidst two hours of ads and product placement.'

Ryan said: 'I just saw the Product Placement logo on The X Factor and now i don't know who to trust in this world anymore', in reference to a logo that Ofcom says must be shown to let viewers know that the programme-maker has been paid to include products in that programme.

Alex Moran wrote: 'Just seen the Samsung product placement on the X factor. Shameless company'.

Followed by Scott Dalton who wrote: 'Given how many times we've now seen it, I'm guessing the Corinthia Hotel has paid for its 'product placement' in X Factor tonight.'

X Factor said it was paying for the contestants to stay in the Corinthia Hotel, a 'grand', 'prestigious' hotel in Whitehall, just a stone's throw away from 10 Downing Street.

In previous years ITV splashed out £4,000 a week for the contestants to live in a mansion near Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, which featured a pool, hot
tub, sauna and even its own duck pond.

Now, not only do the 12 finalists and four 
wildcards have their own corridor and the rule of £500 per night rooms in the five star hotel, 
but the guys have unlimited access to the spa, gym and beauty treatments
by request.

During the live show last night, the front of the hotel, including the branding, was shown during the contestant's video diaries, a diary which recaps each of the finalist's previous week.

At one point last night, contestants were filmed entering the hotel and being in shock at their glamorous new home.

Kye Sones is then filmed saying: 'I can't believe we are going to be living here. That is mental.'

Then he is taken to his bedroom where he exclaims: 'Oh my god' before jumping on the bed.

They are also captured using Samsung phones to speak to their mentors in other countries and filmed holding the phone out in front of them so they can be seen vividly.

At several points the camera zooms in to the phones so the branding can be seen clearly.

There
is also Twitter page called 'X Factor Hotel' which features 'all the 
gossip from the Corinthia Hotel, home to the X Factor finalists during 
the live shows.'

On the X Factor website, viewers can be directed to the 'Samsung Video Diaries', a 1.5 minute video showing all the finalists receiving their Samsung products - including a phone and a tablet.

They are heard screaming, shouting 'this is better than Christmas' and filmed using their phones and taking photos of each other on their tablets.

Some of the contestants are captured looking more awkward than others as they are using the devices for the camera.

From
February 2011 TV programmes made for UK audiences were allowed to 
contain product placement as long as they comply with a list of rules 
set by the communications watchdog.

The X Factor Hotel has its own Twitter pages where 16,881 are following 'all the gossip from the Corinthia Hotel'

Product placement is when a company pays a TV channel or programme-maker to include its products or brands in a programme.

Samsung
signed a deal with X Factor producers Syco and FremantleMedia earlier 
this year, where it was agreed the brand would have a presence on the TV
show, X Factor's website, and an android application for the Samsung Galaxy Note II.

X Factor said the only product placement deal they have is with Samsung.

An X Factor spokesman told MailOnline: 'As in previous series where the contestants have been filmed living in a house, shots of the Corinthia are used where appropriate to the editorial content.'

Mark Trinder, Sales Director, ITV said: 'We are delighted to be working with Samsung and this initiative is a key part of a wider and integrated multiplatform partnership.

'Editorial integrity remains at the heart of what we do, and we feel this is an excellent brand fit.'
