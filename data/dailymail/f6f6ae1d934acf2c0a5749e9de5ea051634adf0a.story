As an enthusiastic member of a historical re-enactment society, John Smith went to great lengths to be as realistic as possible in his role as a German Second World War soldier.

Unfortunately, when he left his army machine gun visible in his classic car, passers-by thought it was a real weapon – and called the police.

When Smith returned to his vehicle he was surrounded by armed police and arrested.

Worrying time: John Smith was swooped upon by armed police after a member of the public reported seeing the butt of his replica machine gun and bayonet on the backseat of his vintage car

The 56-year-old told officers it was only a prop and it had been left in his car in readiness for a display the following day.

But because he refused to allow the police to destroy his imitation weapons he was charged and taken to court.

Common sense prevailed when the judge
 dealing with his case at Sheffield Crown Court recognised he was a 
genuine enthusiast and intervened to save Smith from punishment and his 
weapons from destruction.

Held: The police note after officers took possession of John Smith's deactivated Steyre MP34 German machine gun

Judge Michael Murphy told him: ‘I am quite satisfied that you are not a criminal and this is part of your hobby.’

Police requested the forfeiture of 
his deactivated 1934 Steyr MP34 German machine gun, valued at around 
£3,000, as well as two replica pistols.

But the judge said: ‘I don’t want 
historical artefacts to be destroyed and so I am not going to make an 
order to destroy these things.’

A compromise was agreed after 
discussions between the parties.

Smith admitted possessing an imitation 
firearm in a public place and was given a  12-month conditional 
discharge.

And police were told to return his weapons as long as they 
were kept in a locked cabinet or in the boot of his 1954 Wolseley car 
while travelling to events.

The court heard that Smith, of 
Barnsley, South Yorkshire, packed his machine gun, his Walther PPK 
pistol – which was held together with tape – and his P38 automatic 
handgun in the car with his uniforms last August.

He was taking his Wehrmacht uniform 
and shirt to be washed and ironed at his mother’s house ready for a 
‘living history’ display the next day.

Neil Coxon, prosecuting, said: ‘He 
dropped off his uniform at his mother’s and then decided to go and see a
 friend nearby, leaving his car parked up in a public place.

‘He spent two hours there and police 
were alerted because the gun was on the back seat.

An armed response 
unit turned up and were on the point of putting a window through on the 
Wolseley when Mr Smith walked out of a flat 50 yards away.’

Historical: The replica machine gun which led to five costly court appearances for John Smith

Robert Sandford, defending, said it 
was ‘ill-judged’ to leave the machine gun only partially covered on the 
back seat with the butt visible, but he said there was nothing 
‘sinister’ about travelling with the gun, which was ‘a prop’.

After the hearing Smith said he had 
refused to accept a ticking off or a caution at the police station 
because it would have meant handing over the guns.

‘I couldn’t agree to 
that because of their historical significance,’ he said.

Decision to make: Judge Michael Murphy, sitting at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, argued that 'common sense' should be applied to John Smith's case
