A group of Palestinian workers rebuild a tunnel linking the occupied Gaza strip with Egypt after it was destroyed by the latter's army during a military operation.

More than 1,000 tunnels originally linked the Gaza strip with Egypt, but a majority were destroyed last summer when the Egyptian army conducted several demolition raids following the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi in July.

Egyptian security authorities say they have closed more tunnels because of militant attacks on Egyptian security forces in the lawless Sinai Peninsula - an allegation the Palestinian movement denies.

Going down the hole: The tunnels have been used to transport everything from weapons to KFC chicken buckets into Gaza from Egypt

Rebuilding: The was allegedly a network of nearly 1,000 tunnels linking Egypt and occupied Gaza, but the Egyptian army conducted several major attacks on the underground connections, destroying them

By August, only a few hundred remained according to Palestinian tunnel operators.

Egyptian
 security forces moved in with bulldozers and dynamite to demolish the 
network of tunnels which are used to transfer everything from cheap fuel
 to weapons and commercial goods such as KFC chicken buckets into the 
Palestinian territory.

Ashraf,
 29, a tunnel owner, said: ‘We are working to fix the tunnel quietly 
away from Egyptian eyes. There are six workers in the morning and 
another six continue to work at night under the border with Egypt.

‘They pull out the sand and mud that filled the tunnel using plastic containers pulled out by a machine.’

He says the work is dangerous and that the tunnels can collapse at any moment.

Heigh ho: The tunnels are sponsored by the Hamas-run government that seized control over the Gaza Strip from forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas seven years ago

The workers are attempting to rebuild the tunnels without being detected by Egyptian authorities, a dangerous job where the roof of the unstable tunnels can collapse at any minute

The
 tunnels are sponsored by the Hamas-run government that seized control 
over the Gaza Strip from forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud 
Abbas in 2007.

They are used to bring fuel, gas, goods, building materials and medicine into the impoverished region.

Abu Mohamed 45, another tunnel owner said: ‘Since the fall of Morsi, the tunnels completely stopped working.

‘I'm
 here with my workers to try to expand, clean up and fix the tunnels and
 then dig another entrance in Egypt after the original entrance was 
destroyed by the Egyptian army.’

However,
 authorities in Egypt are concerned weapons are being smuggled out of 
the Strip and used by Islamic militants in the Sinai Peninsula.
