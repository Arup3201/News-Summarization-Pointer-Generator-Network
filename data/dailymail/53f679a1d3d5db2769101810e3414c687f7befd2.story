An Oklahoma City woman was forced to breastfeed her baby in a YMCA family bathroom with no changing table after a staff member told she couldn't feed the eight-week-old in the women's locker room. 

Tiffany Hoag and another woman were breastfeeding their babies on Wednesday in the women's locker room of the Earlywine Park YMCA when a staff member escorted both of them out. 

Hoag was taken to a family locker room where she nursed baby Ezra next to a shower and a toilet where it was 'dirty' and there were 'towels on the floor'.

Tiffany Hoag was breastfeeding her eight-week-old baby in an Oklahoma City in the women's locker room when a staff member came in and told she couldn't feed baby Ezra there

She was escorted through the gym to a 'family' locker room and was left 'embarrassed and upset' by the whole situation

The first-time mother said that the whole experience was 'disheartening', according to KOCO. 

'You don't think it's going to happen to you,' she said. 'I really am humiliated and just embarrassed. I was escorted out of the locker room and through the gym.'

Hoag said that to make matters worse, Ezra cried as they walked through the gym, attracting more attention. 

'I was really embarrassed and upset because people were looking, and he was crying because he was still hungry,' she told KFOR, adding that she didn't want to return to that YMCA.

The fitness and community center has since released a statement, claiming that the whole situation was a misunderstanding. 

'The Y is a place for families, and we support breastfeeding moms in our facilities. We believe this was likely an unfortunate mistake with our staff member misinterpreting our locker room policy, which states that children are not allowed in adult locker rooms. 

This is the family locker room that Hoag was escorted into so she could breast feed baby Ezra. She said the bathroom was 'dirty' and there were 'towels on the floor' and that she fed Ezra between a shower and a toilet

The YMCA has released a statement apologizing, claiming the situation was a big misunderstanding between staff members

'We are looking into this particular incident further with the staff members involved in an effort to ensure that no other moms have this happen in the future. 

'We are very sorry that this new mom had a negative experience and will continue to train our staff to understand that moms can breastfeed anywhere they would like to do so in our facilities.'

Hoag said that she, too, hopes this doesn't happen to other mothers. 

'If it had to happen to me to make it not happen to ten other mothers, then it's worth it,' she told KOCO. 'And if it ends with me, then I'm happy and I'm good with that.'  

Hoag said that she is raising awareness of her situation because she hopes no other mothers have to go through what she did
