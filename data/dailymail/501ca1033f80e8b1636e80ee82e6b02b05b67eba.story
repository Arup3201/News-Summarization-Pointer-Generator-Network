QPR midfielder Joey Barton has welcomed Mauricio Isla to the club on Twitter after the Juventus utility man announced he was joining the newly-promoted west Londoners on the social networking site.

The Chile international was due to have a medical on Sunday but that was delayed after his flight was cancelled, but despite that a deal has been agreed.

In what will be seen as quite a coup for the newly-promoted west Londoners, Isla is equally adaptable at playing in defence or midfield.

Rangers had also enquired about taking his team-mate Sebastian Giovinco on loan but the diminutive striker is set to stay in Turin.

QPR, meanwhile, are also set to sign Jordan Mutch from Cardiff after the Welsh side accepted a £6m bid from Rangers for the highly-rated midfielder.
