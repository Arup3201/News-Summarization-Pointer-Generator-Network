Scottish Formula 1 star David Coulthard admitted he was in 'huge shock' today after his younger sister died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 35.

Lynsay Jackson - mother to ten-month old baby girl Emilie Anne - is understood to have endured cardiac failure at around 4am yesterday.

The trained nurse, who until relatively recently ran the family’s well-known motoring museum, is understood to have gone to bed complaining of stomach pains before the attack.

Coulthard said in a statement today: 'I'd like to first take this chance to thank everybody for their overwhelming support over the last two days, it means a huge amount to my family and I.

'It's obviously come as a huge shock to us all and we're still trying to come to terms with it all. I'd please ask that my family's privacy is respected during this very difficult time.'

Mrs Jackson’s parents, Joyce, 65 and Duncan, 66, from Twynholm in Dumfries and Galloway, were on holiday in Australia when the incident occurred and were understood to be flying back to the UK.

Police said they had attended Mrs Jackson’s home in Crossmichael, Castle Douglas, in the early hours of yesterday morning but confirmed that, although, enquiries continued, there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances. A report is now being prepared for the Procurator Fiscal.

The 42-year-old racing star’s elder bother, Duncan, yesterday declined to comment at the family home, which sits next to the motoring museum Lynsay helped to found.

The former Formula 1 driver appeared on BBC One's Saturday Kitchen Live yesterday, and is understood to have been told about his sister's death before the programme began.

His agent James Williamson confirmed to MailOnline today: 'He found out just before he went on air.'

Residents in Twynholm were stunned to learn of the devastating news. In Crossmichael, where the Jackson family moved last year, one neighbour told how she watched the shocking tragedy unfold.

Hairdresser Charlene Saunderson said: ‘I heard all the commotion, there were six police cars and lots of family cars.

‘I
knew there was something wrong because the ambulance left with no one 
in it then her brother took the baby away. Then the doctor and a 
forensic team came.’

Recalling
the last time they met, Mrs Saunderson continued: ‘We met Lynsay and 
Will out recently. I think the family were really good to her. The night
we met them about two weeks ago, they had stopped off at a local pub 
for a drink.

'Lynsay liked 
having a laugh, she was witty and if she had something to say she would 
say it. I feel really awful as she said that night at the pub “just come
over for a tea or a coffee” and I never did. I feel so awful.

‘She
was into bodyfit bootcamp and was doing well with. We tried to go 
running and she wanted to get involved in the community. People are just
shocked, especially as she was so young.’

Mrs Jackson got married to her husband, an environmental health officer, in the summer of 2011.

The Monte Carlo-based racer and his only sister were known to be particularly close and always liked to keep in touch.

In 2001, he honoured her with ‘her 
dream birthday present’ when he dedicated his first victory of the 
season in Sao Paulo to her.

Just
days earlier the then 24 year-old had moaned about not receiving a 
birthday present from her brother but was reduced to tears when she 
later saw him on television saying his win in Brazil was in her honour.

Speaking
at the time, she said: ‘I phoned David last Tuesday to wish him a happy
30th birthday and he said he had not managed to get me a present.

‘I was a bit miffed so when he won in Brazil and announced it was dedicated to me it was the best birthday present ever.’

She
added: ‘We watched the race on a German channel and they have breaks 
which seem to last half an hour so we kept having to phone home to 
Twynholm. When David finished the final lap we were ecstatic.’

After his win, the Scottish driver said: ‘It was my sister’s birthday and she asked me for a win, so I dedicate this race to her. This is my 10th win and the best feeling I have had after a victory.’

Previously, the driver talked of his sister’s own impressive driving skills.

He said: ‘There’s no reason at all why women should not race with men. There’s no physical or reaction reason. It just hasn’t happened because more boys get in to it and through that process, it ends up being more men.’

Coulthard was the only one of the familiy’s three children to take up racing driving, even though their father installed 100cc racing carts for each of his three offspring.

Nine years ago, the driver, his sister and brother were united at the funeral of their grandmother, Margaret Coulthard, 88, who died in a care home in 2004.

At the time, an onlooker said: ‘It is obvious they are a close family and there’s no way David wouldn’t have come here today. The man is a true gent. He loved his gran and loves all his family dearly.
