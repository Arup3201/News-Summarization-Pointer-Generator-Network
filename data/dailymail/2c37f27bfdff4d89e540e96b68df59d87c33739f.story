A Manhattan teen was distraught when she found the message 'trash like you' scrawled in her takeout box from trendy New York City burger spot Umami Burger, but learning the truth behind the message would make her feel even worse.

Juliette Borghesan, 15, found the message on Sunday as she recovered from a nasty bout with pneumonia and her father treated her to the meaty treat.

After her father called the restaurant to vent his outrage, the responsible Umami employee soon called to apologize--and to reveal that the to-go box had been filled with actual garbage throughout the day.

Sick to her stomach: As she recovered slowly from a nasty bout with pneumonia, 15-year-old Juliette Borghesan was further sickened when she heard hear takeout box from Manhattan's Umami Burger had contained trash

Meanwhile, Umami Burger execs are denying the staffer's version of things completely.

Not that that matters to Juliette. 

'I’m sick to my stomach,' the teen told DNAinfo after the employee, who's not been identified, told the family the box had been used 'as a trash can for the entire day'.

According to the employee, the trash was dumped out and the box used for Juliette's food after the restaurant ran out of takeout containers. 

'It's a lot more severe now than just handwriting on a box,' her father Tom Borghesan fumed. 'You threatened the health of my daughter, who is presently very ill.'

Juliette had already started digging in to her food when she noticed the message, DNA Info reports.

And Umami Burger has since released a statement, which reads:  

'The writing on the box was an obvious mistake and was not intended for the customer. We've apologized to the customer and are dealing with the matter internally.'

Unsatisfied, Juliette's father apparently pressed further and Umami Burger CEO Paul Clayton called him to personally apologize.

Clayton also told Mr. Borghesan that the former employee was incorrect when he told them the box had contained trash.

The Umami Burger spokesman also said the company was 'dealing with the matter internally.'

After scrawling 'trash like you' on a takeout box, Umami staff used it for garbage all day before then usign it for Juliette's food, a fired employee said. The CEO has since enied this
