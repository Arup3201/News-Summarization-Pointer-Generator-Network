The father of the British tourist, who is on the run after a young Cambodian woman was found brutally murdered, has begged his son to turn himself in to police.

The naked body of the 20-year-old was found with her throat cut, hidden under a bed at the £12-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in the capital Phnom Penh.

Police said they were searching for Stuart James Green, who is believed to still be in the country.

Murder: The woman was found at the Bolyna Palace Hotel in Daun Penh district, Cambodia

His 69-year-old father Barry, of Eccles, Greater Manchester, said today that his son was a loner and did have a temper.

He
 told The Sun: ‘If I could speak to him I would say, “Stuart, hand 
yourself in immediately,” but I’m not confident about the state he’ll be
 in.’

The man had heard from
 his 47-year-old son a few weeks ago when he called and said he had met a
 woman. She spoke briefly to Barry and he was glad to hear his son was 
happy.

He said: ‘He has a temper but he normally wouldn’t hurt anybody, particularly a woman.’

Foreigners
 living in the country said today that Green, from Manchester, would be 
hungry and desperate after five days in hiding as the intense police 
search got under way.

His 
photo and passport details have been issued to police posts on main 
highways, officials at all airports have been placed on alert and hotels
 and guest houses have been ordered to report him should he try to check
 in.

Possibly bedraggled and
 unshaven by now, the bespectacled Briton will quickly draw attention to
 himself if he does try to rent a room.

Room: The naked body of the victim was discovered under the bed in a hotel room

It
 has not been revealed if he took his clothes with him when he left the 
Bolyna Palace Hotel in Phnom Pen with his passport at 11pm on December 
28 - three days after he checked in with the young woman.

Expatriates
 writing on a local discussion post said it was only a matter of time 
before Green was arrested and interrogated about the murder of the 
20-year-old woman, whose body, with her throat slashed, was found under a
 bed in the £12-a-night room.

Green
 had urged a receptionist to return his passport - customarily held 
until the bill was paid - on the night he left because he wanted to go 
to a bank so he could pay for the room the following morning.  Although 
no banks would have been open at that hour, he was given his passport 
and he walked out of the hotel, never to return. The woman's body was 
found by a cleaner the next day.

One
 writer, identified only as Ian, stated: 'This guy will be looking over 
his shoulder every day until he is finally and inevitably caught up 
with.' Another wrote that the hotel was a two-minute stroll from Golden 
Soriya, a shopping mall, 'which as we all know is ground zero for 
scuzzy, dissolute foreign men.'

The
 woman, who has yet to be formally identified as her body now remains in
 a Buddhist temple, was described by police as being aged about 20 and a
 little over 5ft tall.

She was said by local people to have been seen in the past walking with foreign men beside the Mekong River in Phnom Penh.

Cambodia: The man had been staying at a restort in the country with the unnamed woman

One
 expatriate wrote on the discussion page that he believed Green had been
 living in Cambodia for six months, although that would have required 
obtaining a special visa or applying for an extension of his stay.

'There
 is no indication that he has been able to leave the country,' 
Lieutenant Colonel Mom Sitha, of Phnom Penh's foreigner police 
department, said last night.

‘We
 have made checks at all the obvious exit points and there is no listing
 for him.' There is speculation that Green might simply have taken a 
motor bike 'taxi' to a remote area and fled into the jungle where he 
might have found accommodation in a village where the locals would have 
not heard about the police hunt for him.

A regular writer on the discussion page wrote: 'I doubt that he left by air.

‘That
 requires spending more money, using the internet, going to a travel 
agent, possibly having a credit card, going through computerised exit 
immigration, name being on passenger manifest, etc.

Murder: Police today released details of what they said was a shocking crime

'Bus to Bangkok makes more sense. Or a flophouse a block away.

'I
 have no contingency plan for what I would do in this situation.  'I 
might bus it to Siem Reap and try to blend with the tourists before 
figuring out my next move.' Yet another expatriate noted: 'Hiding out in
 Cambodia? He'll be found and arrested.

'Hopped
 the border to Thailand? He'll be found, arrested and extradited.' 
'Hopped the border to Vietnam? Ditto.' 'Made it back to Europe 
(unlikely)? He'll be arrested.'

Police sources said that to remain on 
the run, Green would need cash, food and water, all of which would 
require him to make contact with people. And the more the word spread 
that he was wanted, the greater the chances of him being apprehended.

Police
 said that until Green was found, the reasons for the young woman's 
murder would remain a mystery - although one expatriate said there was 
always the remote possibility that she attacked the Briton and he 
defended himself, before making an effort to calmly leave the hotel.
