John Dunn was found safely by his wife Rosemary who used the MindMe device to track him down

A wife has spoken of her relief after a ‘tracking’ device worn by her husband, who suffers from dementia, saved his life.

John Dunn, 73, went missing on Christmas Day during a family coastal walk while the couple were on holiday.

Unable to locate him, his worried wife Rosemary used the new gadget to track him down and get him to safety.

The ‘MindMe’ locating device was worn around Mr Dunn’s neck and sent information about his location to a control centre almost 100 miles away.

They then contacted a local volunteer ambulance worker who had joined the search where to find Mr Dunn, who was found on a farm track, west of Durdle Door in Dorset, near to where the couple had rented a cottage.

Mr Dunn, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease six months ago, was said to be in a distressed state, was stuck in mud, and had suffered cuts as he tried to get over a barbed wire fence.

He was airlifted to Dorset County Hospital suffering from the early signs of hypothermia, but was successfully treated.

Mrs Dunn said afterwards: ‘If John hadn’t been wearing the device around his neck, it would have been very difficult to locate him.

‘I panicked as soon as I realised that John was missing. It was surprising how far he got in such a short space of time.’ Mindme is a locating device that can attach to a user’s house keys, or simply be placed in a pocket, or hung around the neck.

It is monitored by Chichester Careline, which is run by Chichester District Council, and supports vulnerable people 24 hours a day, every day of the year.

The device, which has already helped to save a number of lives, is a small GPS locator.

If a person becomes lost or disorientated, they can be located through a dedicated website by their family, or Chichester Careline.

The device sends details of its location to the website every four minutes, and is thought to be the smallest GPS locating device in this country.

Mrs Dunn, 62, from Midhurst, West Sussex, added: ‘I cannot explain how much of a relief it is to know that when you have lost someone there is a way of finding them again.

‘If it hadn’t been for the people helping us, I dread to think what would have happened.’ She continued: ‘The device assists us on a regular basis.

‘If I’m sorting the washing out upstairs and John happens to leave the house for a walk, I know that I will be able to locate him if he doesn’t return.

‘On another occasion, John asked if he could wait for me while I popped into a shop for two minutes.

‘When I returned, John had walked off. However, I was able to call Chichester Careline, who told me exactly where I could find him.

‘The device gives John his freedom and provides me with the reassurance that I can find him if he wanders.

‘It is absolutely invaluable and I wouldn’t be without it. Knowing what a difference the device has made to us, I now want to make sure that others in a similar position are aware that this is available.’

A new version has been created which comes with a button allowing the user to speak directly to Chichester Careline.

Cllr Eileen Lintill, Cabinet Member for Wellbeing and Community Services at Chichester District Council, said: ‘The device helps to give freedom to those with dementia, and reassurance to their families 24 hours a day, every day of the year.’

She added: ‘We are delighted that our Mindme device helped to locate John and that he is now fully recovered.’ Chichester Careline is the only centre in the country monitoring the devices.

They are able to locate the person if they become lost - regardless of where they are in Europe as long as they have a mobile network.

Information on the location of the person will only be provided to the carer or family once a series of security checks have been passed.
