Golf fans have become accustomed to the rain at the PGA Championship this week, but the "best" was saved until last as rain pelted down on the Valhalla course on Sunday.

Challengers to overnight leader Rory McIlroy had barely tee'd off when the storm suspended play at 12.53pm (local time), and it wasn't until 2.40p, that play resumed again. The delay will make it tough for the final group to finish their round.

It was almost an impossible job for course workers at Valhalla, but the photographers were still out in force; here are some of the best pictures.
