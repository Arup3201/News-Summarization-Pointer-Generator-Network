A man has lost both of his hands and feet after he was mauled by a pack of dogs while wearing no clothes in eastern Detroit.

The unnamed victim, believed to be in his 40s, was attacked after 12 pit bulls escaped from a house in Pennsylvania Street last night.

Paramedics found him lying naked in a yard in a 'critical' condition, but were unable to get out and help him until police came.

After arriving at the scene, Detroit Police officers fired at the dogs, killing one of them, Sargent Michael Woody told WWJ Newsradio 950.

They were then able to lure the remaining 11 animals inside the house between East Warren and Mach avenues, before locking them inside. The dogs are now in the custody of Animal Control.

'When we found the victim he was lying in a yard, completely naked, being attacked by several pit bulls... and our officers had to try to corral the pit bulls.' said Sgt Woody.

Following the attack at around 9.30pm, the man was taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital, where he remained in a critical condition this afternoon, CBS Detroit reported.

Sgt Woody said it was unclear what the man was doing on the property or why he was naked. 

He added that the pit bills' owner has come forward and is not thought to be involved in dog fighting.

An investigation is ongoing.
