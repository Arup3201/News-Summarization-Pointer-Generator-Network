After meeting Marine Ben McBean for the first time in 2008, Prince Harry declared that the former Royal Marine was 'a hero'.

Today, he turned out to roar on Marine McBean, 27, as he completed a gruelling 31-mile run on behalf of the Poppy Appeal - and told the runner to go and have a 'well-deserved beer'.

The appearance of the royal came as a complete surprise to Marine McBean, who had designed the route through London using a smartphone app to look like a Royal British Legion poppy.

Surprise! Marine Ben McBean found a surprise royal visitor waiting for him as he completed a 31-mile run

Planned out: Starting close to the Tower of London, Marine McBean's run followed the outline of a poppy

'I’m still in shock. I didn’t expect to see Harry,' said Marine McBean, following the run. 'He said "well done" and that I’d raised lots of awareness for a good cause.

'He told me to go have a bath and a well-deserved beer. It was just like picking up where we left off.'

The two men first met in 2008 when a badly injured Marine McBean was repatriated to the UK on the same plane that was taking Prince Harry home.

Clearly touched by his plight, the royal dubbed him a 'hero' after learning that he had lost his left arm and right leg as a result of an IED blast. 

Doctors had feared that Marine McBean, from Plymouth, might die from his injuries but the former commando recovered and is now back on his feet with the help of a prosthetic leg.

Despite the enormous amount of progress he has made, the former soldier did admit that it hasn't always been easy and revealed that running on his prosthesis is painful. 

'I found it very difficult to get from A to B,' he added. 'The run was both physically and emotionally exhausting, but so rewarding.'

Joining Prince Harry at the finish line close to the Tower of London was another former soldier, Falklands veteran Simon Weston. who was badly burned when Argentinean bombers attacked a group of British troop transport ships in June 1982.

Along with Marine McBean, Mr Weston is a long standing supporter of the Poppy Appeal, which is currently enjoying a boost courtesy of the Vodafone Foundation, which provided the technology required to create Private McBean's poppy-shaped route.

He had used a running app to create the giant poppy outline on a London map, which other runners can follow by visiting the website firsts.com.

The Vodafone Foundation will match every pound donated to Marine McBean’s cause, up to £100,000, and the funds raised will help the Royal British Legion’s work to support ex-servicemen and women.

'We’re hugely grateful to Ben McBean and Vodafone for their commitment to the Big Poppy Run and hope that Ben’s run will inspire many others to take part in this exciting challenge,' added Charles Byrne, the Royal British Legion's director of fundraising.

'The money raised will provide vital support to serving and ex-service people, and their families, whether living with bereavement or disability, finding employment, or coping with financial stress - the same problems facing First World War veterans when they returned to the UK 100 years ago.'
