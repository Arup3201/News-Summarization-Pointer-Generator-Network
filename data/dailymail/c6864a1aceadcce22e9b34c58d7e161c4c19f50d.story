Alien invasion is no joke - as one Safeway employee found out this month.

Grocery store worker Steve Yamamoto made a video parodying the closure of his store and 71 others as a sci-fi disaster movie - and was promptly suspended by bosses who did not see the funny side.

Mr Yamamoto showed up at Dominick's supermarket in Chicago for his final shift only to be told bosses at the parent company Safeway had suspended him for one day.

An employee at a Chicago supermarket which was closing down mocked up a sci-fi movie trailer about the store's closure -  only to be suspended by Safeway bosses

On Mr Yamamoto's video, the store appears to explode with the use of some digital wizardry

The California-based retailer is pulling 
out of the Chicago market, closing 72 stores and cutting 6,000 jobs - 
including Mr Yamamoto's position. The closures took place on December 28.

The video was posted to YouTube on December 27 with the title 'Thanks Safeway'. Bosses quickly got wind of the video and suspended Mr Yamamoto the next day.

The clip is styled as a trailer for an 'Independence Day'-like blockbuster and shows alien aircraft landing on the store, robots marching down the aisles and blowing up employees with huge guns.

The video opens with words flashing across the screen: 'We thought we were safe...We were wrong...Like Miley Cyrus wrong...'

It continues: 'It came out of nowhere... all so the big shots... could save a buck...and maybe buy a new summer home.

'This December...the race to unemployment begins...Thanks a lot Safeway.'

Steve Yamamoto, who made the video parody and posted it on YouTube, was suspended for his last day of work at Safeway and could lose three weeks' severance pay

Mr Yamamoto, who worked at the Glen Ellyn store, told NBC: 'My store manager got a phone call that she had to suspend me.

'I was like, ''Are you serious?'' It's crazy as it is. I'm just dumbfounded.'

The employee looks set to lose three weeks severance pay because of the bosses' actions.

Safeway would not comment on the matter when contacted today by MailOnline.

According to Mr Yamamoto's video more than 6,000 people are losing their jobs in the store closures.

At least 15 stores have been sold on but the future of the rest remains uncertain.
