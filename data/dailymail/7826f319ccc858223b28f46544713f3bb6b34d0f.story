A four-year-old boy is lucky to be alive after he was kicked in the head by an untethered horse.

Lewis Harrison was with a friend in a playground metres from his home in South Bank, Middlesbrough, on Friday when the unsecured horse kicked out at him.

The little boy was rushed to hospital with blood streaming down his head having suffered a serious wound.

Injury: Lewis Harrison, four, was playing with a friend in a play area in 
South Bank, Middlesbrough, when an unsecured horse kicked out at him - leaving him with a wound to the head, pictured

Hospital staff told his mother Melissa Bird - who is now calling for parents to be more aware of the dangers of horses - that her son had been lucky not to be killed.

Lewis, who attends Teesville Primary in the town, was playing at South Bank Park when he approached the small white horse and stood behind it.

Ms Bird, 28, said: 'I was in the house when his brother Lee came in screaming "mam, it’s Lewis, his head is gashed open". Then I saw him coming towards me, blood streaming down.'

She said staff at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, where her son was taken, were very concerned about the nature of the injury.

She said: 'They said that if he’d been struck an inch away from the spot he was kicked, or if he’d have been kicked straight in the eye socket, he’d have been killed.

'And if he’d been standing directly behind the horse, rather than slightly to the side, he wouldn’t have stood a chance.

Dangerous: The family say the horses, pictured, were roaming next to the playground in an open public space often used by children

Appeal: Lewis' mother Ms Bird, pictured next to the playground in South Bank, Middlesbrough, has said more parents should be aware of the dangers of unsecured horses

'I could have been planning my son’s funeral today.'

Ms Bird stressed the horses were walking free on a public open space, always used by children.

She
said: 'Lewis knows not to go behind the back legs of a horse, but 
that’s when a grown-up is there. But horses shouldn’t be there on a 
playing field - it’s as simple as that.'

Thankful: Ms Bird said if Lewis had been hit in the eye he would almost certainly have died

A spokesperson for Coast and Country Housing, which manage Redcar and Cleveland Council homes and land, said: 'We deplore the irresponsible actions of horse owners who are allowing their animals to roam in public areas including those where children play.

'We take the issue of stray horses very seriously and have been working with fellow members of the local Joint Equine Group to tackle the problem.

'We would urge members of the public to report stray horses, and any information about their owners, to the police.'

A spokesman from Redcar and Cleveland Council said: 'Initially we issue warnings and in the Greater Eston area these warnings have led to more than 300 instances of illegally tethered horses being removed from council land.

'If these warnings go ignored we will consider enforcement action and to date we have instructed bailiffs to impound 15 horses. The council does not tolerate irresponsible owners illegally grazing their horses on its land.'

A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said the force 'strongly supports' the Joint Equine Group initiative and remains 'committed to tackling the problem of tethered and untethered animals.'
