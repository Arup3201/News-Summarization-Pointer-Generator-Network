Two Polish men were caught trying to leave the UK in a stolen rowing boat this morning as they attempted to paddle across the English Channel to France.

The men were rescued by Dover's Lifeboat crew just two miles into their 21-mile trip after they were spotted.

The two men, who are believed to be in their 20s, are thought to have stolen the boat from Folkestone, Kent, before setting for France just after 8am today.

They were rescued by the crew at Dover Lifeboat station, and told them they 'had no money' and could not find jobs in the UK - and so were 'going to France to find work'.

James Clapham, who works at Dover Lifeboat station, said: 'They were trying to make it to Calais, but with the strong breeze and incoming tide they didn't get very far.

'It's quite unusual to try and get to the other side.

'They said they had been looking for work but didn't find any in Britain and they said they were going back to France.'

The men were handed over to officers from Kent Police at around 11am.

Derek Edwards, 45, who lives in the town, said: 'It's crazy that they were trying to leave Britain when all those people in Calais are desperately trying to get into the country.

'They were lucky they were spotted before they got half way across the Channel or it could have ended in tragedy.'

A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'We were called just before 9am to reports that two Polish men had taken a boat from Folkestone and were rowing to France.

'They were picked up by Dover Lifeboat and the men were questioned by UK Border Force.

'Kent Police is trying to locate the owner of the boat which is believed to be stolen.' 

A Border Force spokesman said no immigration offences had been committed so they were taking no further action.

In July last year a group of 28 illegal immigrants - 22 men, four women and two children - were caught as they tried to sneak out of the UK by stowing away on a lorry.

They were found after the truck they were hiding in disembarked from the P&O ferry The Spirit of France in Calais - and were promptly send back to the UK.

The unnamed Romanian driver of the lorry was questioned by French police before being allowed to continue his journey to Poland.
