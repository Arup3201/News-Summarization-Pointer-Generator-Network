Following Rio Ferdinand being fined £25,000 and banned for three games  for failing to respond to a charge of misconduct regarding an abusive tweet, the FA have now collected an estimated £350,000 for Twitter offences since 2011.

The Queens Park Rangers defender had reacted to online provocation by using the word 'sket' in a post about the person's mother. Sket is a Caribbean word meaning a whore or promiscuous girl or woman.

Since the 2010-11 season, the FA have investigated 121 incidents of inappropriate comments on social media sites.

Rio Ferdinand was banned for three games and fined £25,000k by the FA for a tweet

Ferdinand has been charged for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket'

October 2014: Rio Ferdinand fined £25,000 and handed a three-match ban for failing to respond to charge of misconduct regarding an abusive tweet

September 2014: Benoit Assou-Ekotto fined £90,000 and banned for three-matches for tweeting support of Nicolas Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' gesture in December 2013 

October 2012: Cole fined £90,000 for describing the FA as a 'bunch of t****ts' on Twitter 

August 2012: Ferdinand fined £45,000 for retweeting another user referring to then international team-mate Cole as 'choc ice'

March 2011: Carlton Cole had to pay £20,000 for comments posted during England's friendly with Ghana 

January 2011: Ryan Babel fined £10,000 and given a warning over future conduct for posting a doctored picture of referee Howard Webb in a Manchester United shirt on Twitter

Nearly 60 of those investigations have led to charges, and of those, 33 have involved aggravated breaches of the rules which came into force in 2010-11, before being further tightened last May as part of the FA's inclusion and anti-discrimination plan.

And as a part of these new directives, the FA have introduced an educational program which they think will be a vital guard against re-offending - and Ferdinand will be required to attend it within four months on top of his fine and ban.

The recent charge was not the former England captain's first social media offence. In 2012 he was fined £45,000 for retweeting  another user referred to his then international team-mate Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice'.

Former Chelsea left back Ashley Cole has also been fined in the past for inappropriate comments on Twitter

And the former Chelsea left-back himself is one of only two players to have been fined more than Ferdinand in the past by the FA for similar offences. 

In 2012 he was fined £90,000 for describing the FA as a 'bunch of t****' in response to their questioning of evidence he gave in John Terry's trial for racially abusing Ferdinand's brother, Anton.

The other was fellow left back Benoit Assou-Ekotto of Tottenham, who was slapped with a £50,000 fine for tweeting his support of Nicolas Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' gesture in December of last year.

His message, which was written in French slang and translated to 'I congratulate you on the beautiful quenelle', was later deleted. He was also handed a three-match ban.

Other high profile cases of Twitter fines include then Liverpool midfielder Ryan Babel, who was fined £10,000 and given a warning over future conduct by the FA in 2011 for posting a doctored picture on Twitter of referee Howard Webb wearing a Manchester United shirt after the 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford in the FA Cup.

And Carlton Cole had to pay £20,000 in 2011 for comments he posted during England's friendly against Ghana.

The West Ham forward caused outrage during the 1-1 draw at when he tweeted: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap! Hahahaha. The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/ the St. George's flag!'

Fines have not been restricted to just the Premier League, with St Neots Town official Mike Green once ordered to pay £50 for comments he posted about a referee.

The FA is a non-profit organisation, and all money collected from fines is invested back into the game at every level.
