Lee Tomlin would be the first to admit he has gone dangerously close to blowing his career.

The Middlesbrough forward had a rather poor attitude and was kicked out of Leicester City — he was even sent out on loan by Rushden and Diamonds.

‘I was playing for Brackley Town with team-mates who were carpenters and police officers,’ he says. ‘At that stage I did think it was over.’

Lee Tomlin's career almost ended before it had began due to his bad attitude and taste for fast food

He quit football after being released by Leicester, albeit only for a few months. 

And a minor brush with the law, for celebrating promotion with Peterborough a little too enthusiastically, did not enhance his chances of fulfilling his potential. Nor did a taste for fast food that saw him balloon in weight.

Yet here he is in the hotel next to Middlesbrough’s training ground, slim and athletic and talking as candidly about his past as he does passionately about his future. Talking in a way that left me thinking he might be the hungriest footballer I’ve encountered. He seems driven by a fear, having already wasted opportunities, of not now making it big.

When he came up against Manchester City in the FA Cup last month, his biggest game to date, he was awestruck at first.

‘I was looking at Silva and Aguero and thinking, “What’s someone like me doing on a pitch with players like that?” It was unbelievable.

The 26-year-old is hungry to succeed after almost wasting his chance to make it in the big time

‘While you’re on the pitch you have to concentrate on your job. I was marking James Milner but I kept finding myself watching David Silva. I was looking at his positioning and trying to learn what’s required to get to the top.’

He learned fast. The 26-year-old was the outstanding player in a match Boro won in style. His manager, Aitor Karanka, pulled him to one side at the end. ‘Now do you believe you can play at this level?’ he asked.

Karanka considers Tomlin, a natural No 10 with two great feet and a burst of pace, as the finest player in the Championship, a view endorsed by the recent player-of-the-month award.

But the journey to this point has been a difficult one.

Tomlin's path from a tough Leicester estate to Championship star has been a difficult one

Liverpool offered him a trial 10 years ago, but he is still waiting to hear how he did.

Some members of his extended family are Travellers but he grew up in a council house in a tough neighbourhood in Leicester.

His parents split when he was two and he can’t recall meeting his father, who is now deceased. His mother re-married and Tomlin has a lot of time for the long-distance lorry driver who became his stepfather and supported them by doing night shifts.

But he did struggle with authority figures in football.

Tomlin was seven when he first started at Leicester and for two years his older brother would escort him to and from training. But from nine, with his brother drawn to the usual teenage distractions, Tomlin commuted alone.

‘It wasn’t the best part of town to grow up in,’ he says. ‘I’m not saying it was an excuse but you had to look after yourself. It wasn’t somewhere you’d necessarily want to bring your kids up. I struggled to take criticism from the coaches. I’d take it personally and answer back.

‘I didn’t like being told what to do. My attitude was poor. I never did anything terrible. I’ve always been someone who would be first in the training ground and last out but I’d mess around.

‘I wouldn’t work as hard as I needed to. Because of the ability I had I didn’t think I needed to. But by the time I was 15, Leicester — the club I’d always dreamed of playing for — had let me go.’

He ‘gave up football’ for a while after that. ‘But I then came to realise that football was the best chance I had. I wasn’t great at school!’

He phoned three clubs: Rushden and Diamonds, Northampton Town and Kettering Town. Rushden offered him a trial and at 16 he made his first-team debut, playing well enough to secure that week-long trial at Liverpool.

Tomlin was awestruck at first while playing during Middlesbrough's win over Manchester City in the FA Cup

‘They put me in digs and I did well in a reserve game against Birmingham,’ he says. ‘I remember being at Melwood and watching the first team train. Seeing players like Gerrard and thinking, “This is amazing”. But I went back to Rushden and never heard a thing.’

By the time he was 21 he secured a move to Peterborough and it was Darren Ferguson who finally started to get through to him. Particularly when it came to his diet. ‘He got me right head-wise,’ he says. The two remain friends even if Tomlin was unhappy when Ferguson refused to sell him to Celtic 18 months ago.

‘Celtic were bidding for me during a game and I thought I was about to join a club that had been drawn against Barcelona, AC Milan and Ajax in the Champions League,’ he says. ‘But he wouldn’t let me go because it was so late in the window, and I accused him of denying me the chance to provide for my family. I was sent off in three of the next four games!’

And now Tomlin is excited by the prospect of testing himself against star-studded Arsenal

He was sent off when Middlesbrough’s scouts went to watch him against Oldham but Karanka signed him and the Spaniard has also been a hugely positive influence.

‘People would see me and think I didn’t even look like a footballer in the past,’ he says. ‘But I’ve lost a stone and a half since I came to Boro. I’ve been doing things right for the last two years, eating right, working hard. I can still be a joker but I know when it’s time to work and when it’s time to have fun.’

He is focused on gaining promotion with a Boro side top of the Championship. Focused also on another chance to test himself against players he hopes to face regularly. It is Arsenal on Sunday in the FA Cup. ‘Sanchez, Cazorla and Ozil,’ he says with excitement. ‘They’re my kind of players.’

He performed to their level against City, nearly scoring what would have been a wonderful goal when a startling piece of skill was followed by a shot on the turn that rattled a post. ‘I thought, “That’s just my luck”,’ he says. ‘I was up against the best centre half in the world (Vincent Kompany) and it would’ve been great if that had gone in.

‘Arsenal is another chance to show what I can do.’

And another step, he hopes, towards becoming a Premier League player and the security he now seeks for his young family: his partner and their two young boys.

‘I want to be able to provide a better life for my family,’ he says. ‘And I want to get my mum out of that council house.’
