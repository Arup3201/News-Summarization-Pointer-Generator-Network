Former President Bill Clinton may have a reputation as a  lady's man, but there is one woman who it seems was not as never won over by that famous charm of his.

In an oral history project on the Clinton White House being released this month by the University of Virginia former Hillary Clinton aide Susan Thomases reveals that she made it very clear to President Clinton on the campaign trail that she would put up with no nonsense.

And that meant, above all else, no sex with other women.

Under control: Thomases says her speech worked, and that President Clinton had no sex with other women while campaigning to be president in 1992

'I told him if I found him having sex on the campaign, he was dead, that I was leaving and taking everybody with me,' says Thomases according to the New York Post.

'I said, "You’re stupid enough to blow this whole presidential thing over your d**k. And if that turns out to be true, buddy, I’m going home, and I’m taking people with me. If you don’t have enough self-control to keep yourself straight, then it’s just dumb." '

In the end, Thomases' threat ended up working wonders it seems, at least during the campaign, as she says President Clinton was 'straight as could be.'

Thomases would make such an impact on the campaign trail back in 1992, that she even wound up as a character in the wildly popular book, and then film, Primary Colors, with her name changed to Lucille Kaufmann.

Back at it: President Clinton may need another speech from Thomases if his wife Hillary decided to run in 2016

These days, the 70-year-old Thomases is not working and living in New York, being forced to retire from her career as an attorney when she developed multiple sclerosis a few years back. 

That may all change should Hillary decide to run for president however, and President Clinton needs another pep talk.

'Sometimes you have to be that blunt, and he gets it,' says Thomases of laying down the law with the former Commander in Chief. 

'That’s not a long speech. It takes all of about 30 seconds.'
