McDonald's has closed down its franchises in Crimea, it was reported today.

The U.S. fast-food giant has suspended work for ‘manufacturing reasons' in Simferopol, Sevastopol and Yalta.

McDonald’s is the second international company to cease operations in Crimea this week, following the peninsula’s hasty annexation by Russia last month.

The Crimean instability, and the recent invalidation of the referendum to reunite with Russia by the United Nation, means as it is unclear how the change may impact business in the Black Sea region.

McDonald's, which operates three restaurants in Crimea, said it hoped to resume work as soon as possible, but offered to help relocate staff to Ukraine, even offering three months housing paid for by the company.

This signals the multi-national fast-food chain does not expect its Crimean business to reopen in the near future.

‘The company has provided an opportunity to all employees ... to transfer to any other McDonald's restaurants in Ukraine preserving their positions, salaries and fees and paying to relocate employees and their families,’ it said in a statement.

The closures follow Geneva-based Universal Postal Deutsche Post's announcement that it was no longer accepting letters bound for Crimea as delivery to the region was no longer guaranteed.

The news of the business exodus comes as British Foreign Secretary William Hague urged the EU to press on with tough sanctions against Russia over the developments in Crimea.

Ahead of a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Athens, today, he said as Russian forces still remain on Ukraine's eastern border, the EU cannot be fooled to think the issue has been solved.

Not relaxing: British Foreign Secretary William Hague

‘We haven't seen real de-escalation by Russia and therefore Europe must not relax in preparing a third tier of sanctions and making sure we continue to have a strong and united response,’ he said.

Hague was referring to tough trade and economic measures that the EU has threatened to take against Russia if it moves beyond Crimea into southern and eastern Ukraine.

At the meeting in the Greek capital, Hague and his EU counterparts will discuss new ways the European Union can help Ukraine overcome its conflict with Russia, and discuss how the bloc can approach its neighbours to the east and south more effectively.

They are not expected to make any decisions but could look at possible new sanctions against Russia and how the EU can help Kiev benefit from the EU's 11-billion-euro ($15 billion) aid package announced in recent weeks.

Hague said it was too early for the EU's 28 governments to bolster sanctions against Moscow for now.

‘But they have to be ready because the situation remains very dangerous,’ he said.

Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea has greatly strained its relations with Europe and is raising questions about the bloc's long-term policy towards Moscow and as well as about the EU's ability to support stability in the region.
