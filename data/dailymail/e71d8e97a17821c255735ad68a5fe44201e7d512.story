A young disabled football fan was turned away from watching Manchester United on his birthday - because the club wasn't warned he would be in a wheelchair. 

Autistic Tyler Short, 14, had joined his father Chris for the 530-mile round coach trip from their home to Old Trafford, with tickets from their local supporters club in Devon. 

He can walk short distances but also uses a wheelchair - and on the family's previous trips to the ground, Mr Short said they have folded up the chair and sat in the general seating area, rather than the disabled section.

But before the match against Southampton last week, Mr Short was told he could not enter the ground with the wheelchair.

Instead he was directed to the ticket office, where his tickets were confiscated because the names on the stubs did not match either Tyler or himself.

Mr Short, a United member, bought the tickets through the North Devon branch of the supporters club and travelled on their coach.

But the seats were on different rows and would have meant he could not sit next to his son.

A United spokesman said: 'Season tickets are transferable to family members but individual match tickets are not. Fundamentally, the supporter should have informed us of his son's wheelchair needs prior to the game so that suitable seating could be found'

To allow them to sit side-by-side, Mr Short was given another supporter's ticket on the coach while Tyler retained his original.

Tyler's ticket was in the name of his older brother, Callum 18, who is also a United member. 

He said: 'My boy was crying his eyes out. He could not understand what was happening.

'I said to them 'I have come 300 miles. Look at the state of my son, he is crying his eyes out'.'

Mr Short, 51, and Tyler were forced to wait outside the stadium until the game was over before rejoining their coach party for the journey back home to Bideford

In desperation, Dean Evans, from the North Devon Supporters Club, rang the ticket office to explain the situation, but the officials stood firm.

Mr Evans said: 'I could hear his son crying. It was proper sobbing. I was getting quite irate with the bloke on the phone.

'Anybody with a bit of commonsense would have said "go to your seat and we'll sort it out".'

Mr Short, 51, and Tyler were forced to wait outside the stadium until the game was over before rejoining their coach party for the journey back home to Bideford.

Tyler, who was hoping to watch his favourite player Wayne Rooney, cried all the way.

A United spokesman said: 'Season tickets are transferable to family members but individual match tickets are not.

'Fundamentally, the supporter should have informed us of his son's wheelchair needs prior to the game so that suitable seating could be found.

'The game was a sell out and so we could not re-house them even if they had not swapped tickets on the coach.'

The Supporters Club reimbursed him for the cost of the two £50 tickets and the coach travel.
