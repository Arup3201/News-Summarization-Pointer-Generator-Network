It was meant to be a fun-filled trip with his family to Disney World, but reality set in for a former senior Venezuelan judge when he stepped off a flight in Miami and federal agents carted him off to jail.

Benny Palmeri-Bacchi, 46, never made it to the Orlando theme park, and instead today it was revealed he will now be spending at least 20 years in prison over links to Colombian drug cartels. 

Mr Palmeri walked into the 'bear trap' in July after a secretive and far-reaching inquiry by US investigators into links between Venezuelan government officials and Colombian 'narcos'.

Prosecutors had accused Mr Palmeri of taking bribes to allow traffickers smuggle cocaine through Venezuela from neighbouring Colombia, the world's No 2 producer of the drug after Peru.

The consignments of cocaine were shipped through Venezuela to Mexico and the Caribbean by plane to be sold and distributed in the U.S.

The former  legal official in the South American country pleaded guilty in a federal court in Miami this week to money laundering, conspiracy and extortion charges. He initially denied the accusations.

Mr Palmeri's arrest and admission over the claims against him is the first time an ally of the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has been tied to the Colombian drugs trade.

The prosecutors dropped a charge claiming Mr Palmeri was involved in the distribution of cocaine in return for his pleading guilty on the three other counts, each of which carries a 20-year jail term.

Venezuela's self-styled socialist government has always denied claims it has links with smugglers who traffic cocaine from Colombia through its 1,400 mile porous border with the neighbouring country.

Harry Landen, a Venezuela expert at the University of South Florida, said the country's leadership under President Nicolas Maduro would likely distance themselves from Mr Palmeri.

An academic said if the government of president Nicolas Maduro (left) is 'smart' they'll distance themselves from Palmeri. His arrest is the first an ally of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez over links  to the 'narcos'

'Whether the government is embarrassed by this depends on how senior this judge was, how close he was to the previous party of Chávez or the new party of Máduro, and who he knew.

'If they're smart they'll write him off as a rogue agent, someone acting on his own and whose activities they condemn completely.'

Mr Palmeri's plea deal recommends his terms be served concurrently, but the US district court judge Ursula Ungaro can decide at the sentencing hearing in February to make them run consecutively.

Informants were key in bringing the case against Mr Palmeri. Veteran prosecutor Richard Gregorie, who brought down Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in 1992, led the team of investigators.

The indictment alleged, Mr Palmeri threatened an estate agent by emailing photographs of a man being murdered and videos of prisoners being sodomised in Venezuelan prisons.

Authorities saw an opportunity to get Mr Palmeri when he applied for a visa at the US embassy in Caracas for his family holiday to Florida.

Mr Palmeri's Miami-based lawyer, Edward Abramson, told the court at his initial appearance after his arrest in July, that his client had walked into 'a bear trap' of the US government's creation.

The former judge had pleaded not guilty to all charges but changed his mind apparently in return for cooperating with investigators.

Prosecutors dropped the distribution charge, which carried a sentence of life. Mr Gregorie's office did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.

Mr Palmeri was one of three men indicted in December 2013 by department of justice investigators looking into the Colombian Cartel of the Suns.

U.S. anti-drugs officials have claimed there was a loose alliance of political leaders and military officials in the government of long-time late Venezuelan president Chávez.
