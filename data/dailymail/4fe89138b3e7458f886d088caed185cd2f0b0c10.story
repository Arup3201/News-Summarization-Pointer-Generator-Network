Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has suggested more measures may be taken to make a driver's life more difficult over the course of a grand prix weekend.

Ecclestone's remarks follow on from a suggestion of his coming into force from this weekend's race in Singapore with the banning of certain types of radio messages.

Asked whether he was in favour of the ban, Ecclestone smiled and then replied: 'As I was the one who started it off, yes.'

Suggested it was imperative drivers do more rather than continually relying on information from the pit wall, Ecclestone added: 'I think none of the drivers want it (radio). They are all happy it has gone.

'They drive the cars, they should know what is wrong or right. They don't need someone on the pit wall telling them what to do.

'We have a regulation in force drivers must drive the car unaided. They have been aided - and still are.

'Even if we get rid of this 'ship to shore' as I call it, there are still a lot of aids that they should not have.

'Driving is still not easy, but it was easier than it was.'

Asked whether more rule changes would come into effect, the 83-year-old replied: 'I think we might...to make their life more difficult.'

From the Singapore Grand Prix this weekend teams can't assist their drivers as much via radio contact

Ecclestone, meanwhile, has poured cold water on plans to reduce his race-sanctioning fees to promoters in order for them to lower ticket prices to get more fans through the turnstiles.

Empty seats this year at venues such as Hockenheim and Monza that are traditionally packed have raised concerns amongst teams.

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff confirmed teams have mooted the idea to Ecclestone about lowering his fees, which range from around £10million to £18million per event.

That, however, according to Ecclestone, would mean a reduction in the prize pot available to all teams at the end of a campaign.

'Has he (Wolff) told you how?' responded Ecclestone with regard to Wolff's remarks.

'You should tell him about reducing what they want for racing, and then we can reduce the fees.

'We collect money for the teams who 70 plus per cent of the revenue that comes from the promoters.'
