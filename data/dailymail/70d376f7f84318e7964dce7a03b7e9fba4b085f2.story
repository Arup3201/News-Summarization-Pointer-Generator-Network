This was an afternoon that had it all. Comebacks, shambolic defending,  and - for Kenny Jackett at least - the dawning realisation that they need to learn how to hold on to leads.

Wolves were behind, then ahead before surrendering twice. They are games like these that may determine whether the newboys can keep pace at the top. Reading, for all their good work going forward, were there for the taking.

Nick Blackman's own goal had looked like handing the visitors all three points, but Glenn Murray’s vicious strike from the edge of the box as we crept into injury time stole the show.

A four-minute spell early in the second half to yield three goals was the obvious highlight, but this was captivating from start to finish.

Wolves were dozy in switching on to Jordan Obita’s short corner with Oliver Norwood before the latter whipped in wonderfully from the right, allowing the young central defender Michael Hector to steal a yard at the near post and thump home a header.

It was a sweet moment for the 22-year-old, who netted a first goal for the club who brought him through its academy.

This is his first sustained period in the first team alongside the more experienced Alex Pearce; Hector has had to work for an opportunity after no less than an astonishing 11 loan spells away in a short career. The last - a season at Aberdeen - clearly did him no harm.

On-loan striker Murray showed just why the majority of the Championship wouldn’t mind having him in their midst after his quick thinking robbed Richard Stearman of possession and won the initial corner and would later flash an effort just wide after easily pushing the weak Kevin McDonald off the ball 30 yards out.

The Royals might have found themselves behind before that 19th minute opener, though. 

The impressive George Saville, only 21 and formerly of Chelsea, found himself in Pearce’s slipstream after intelligent work from Leon Clarke but could only fire straight at Adam Federici.

Wolves, too narrow and one-paced, had struggled to really get a grip on this until the break. 

Six minutes after it, Bacary Sako was finally afforded time to run at Chris Gunter on the left and drilled a cross low towards James Henry at the back post who duly obliged.

The away end of the Madjeski - heavily populated with 1,800 visiting supporters  - went berserk.

Even more so three minutes later. Inexplicably unmarked on the penalty spot, Lee Evans calmly slotted in a second after Obita uncharacteristically gave the ball away in his own box.

The four-minute madness didn’t end there. Almost immediately from the restart the hosts were level. Simon Cox broke menacingly through the middle, playing in Jake Taylor and the winger slotted underneath Carl Ikeme. 

Then more drama. Blackman put through his own net from a corner to spark further delirium before wily Murray was able to earn a share of the spoils for Adkins.
