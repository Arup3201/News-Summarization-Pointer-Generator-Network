A dog that became a media sensation after crashing an Indiana half marathon has died just a week after receiving a medal for completing the race.

The 100-pound chocolate Labrador retriever named Boogie ran most of the 13.1 miles in the October 5 Evansville event after escaping his leash the night before.

Owner Jerry Butts made an appointment for the dog to be neutered after the race to curb his wandering ways.

Died: Boogie, a chocolate Labrador was awarded a medal for finishing the Evansville Half Marathon last week in Indiana. He died on Tuesday of a heart attack

Happy and healthy: Boogie, and his owner, Jerry Butts, centre, outside the Downtown YMCA after he crashed the Evansville Half Marathon and ran for two hours with the runners. The dog was 10 years old when he died on Tuesday

Rascal: The dog was known to be 'a rascal and was not being too shy to soak up the glory', according to his owner's Facebook page

The Evansville Courier & Press reports that Boogie died Tuesday of an apparent heart attack. He was 10 years old.

Butts says on his Facebook page that the dog was a rascal and was 'not being too shy to soak up the glory'.

Boogie finished the race in two hours and 15 minutes.
