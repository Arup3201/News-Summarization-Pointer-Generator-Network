Dylan Hartley escaped another lengthy ban which would have jeopardised his Six Nations participation but still left Stuart Lancaster facing a selection headache on Tuesday night.

The 28-year-old Northampton hooker received a three-week suspension - the fifth ban of his career - at a disciplinary hearing in London following an ugly incident during Saturday’s East Midlands derby which saw him sent off by referee JP Doyle after 16 minutes for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face.

RFU judicial officer Jeremy Summers accepted Hartley’s guilty plea and mitigating circumstances, which included a degree of provocation by Smith, but took into consideration his appalling disciplinary record.

April 2007 - banned for 26 weeks after being cited for eye-gouging Wasps forwards James Haskell and Jonny O'Connor.

March 2012 - received an eight-week suspension after being cited for biting Ireland forward Stephen Ferris' finger while playing for England in a Six Nations game.

December 2012 - banned for two weeks after being cited for punching Ulster hooker Rory Best during a Heineken Cup match.

May 2013 - sent off for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes during the Aviva Premiership final against Leicester at Twickenham. Received an 11-week suspension that sidelined him for the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia that he had been selected for.

December 2014 - sent off for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face. Banned for three weeks.

* Hartley,  has now been banned for a total of 50 weeks during his playing career.

‘The sanction reflects the low-end entry point of the offence, which carries a two-week tariff,’ said Summers. ‘The entry point was aggravated having regard to Dylan’s previous record and a week was taken off to reflect mitigating circumstances. As such the sanction reflects the player’s record rather than the seriousness of the offence itself.’

With a nine-week ban available for elbowing offences deemed to be at the high end of the scale, Hartley can consider himself lucky only to be ruled out for three Aviva Premiership games before being available to return for Northampton’s European Cup clash with the Ospreys on January 18.

Hartley, who admitted he was in the ‘last-chance saloon’ with England following the 13-week ban that saw him miss last year’s Lions tour to Australia, had feared an even lengthier punishment that would have seen him miss the Six Nations. England open their campaign against Wales in Cardiff on February 6.

It was unclear on Tuesday night if Lancaster will take any further disciplinary action against his troubled hooker. The coach was livid with Hartley, who has won 61 caps, for getting a yellow card for stamping on South Africa’s Duane Vermeulen in November.

Early indications suggest Lancaster, whose resources at hooker are not especially deep, will be willing to give the Saints captain another chance. His physicality, set-piece excellence and leadership qualities make him unquestionably England’s first choice. But the point when Lancaster decides enough is enough must surely be drawing near.

Having exiled Danny Care from his squad in 2012 on disciplinary grounds, there will inevitably be murmurs of double standards if Lancaster fails to act against another persistent miscreant.

Hartley pleaded guilty to elbowing Smith via video-conference and received support from Saints boss Jim Mallinder, who claimed in the aftermath of his side’s victory over the Tigers that there was ‘no malice’ in the stray elbow, which caught Smith square on the jaw.

Mallinder argued the offence was only worthy of a yellow card, while claiming Smith was guilty of play-acting. Injured Saints prop Alex Corbisiero went as far as to accuse Smith of ‘deserving an Oscar’ for his reaction while commentating on BT Sport.

‘The red card was disappointing,’ Mallinder said after the game. ‘Dylan’s got to keep his arms down but he was being held. I don’t think there was any malice in it. In the nature of the game I don’t think it justified a red card.’

Saints were left fuming by Doyle’s decision. The referee had appeared ready to issue a yellow card before being persuaded it deserved red following consultation with television match official Sean Davey.

‘I think Smith went down pretty easily,’ Mallinder added. ‘It was probably a yellow card. It’s a tough game and Dylan plays to the edge. You won’t change Dylan. He’s competitive.’

Hartley has been unable to shake off a reputation as a troublemaker since he was banned for 26 weeks for eye gouging in 2007.

He has subsequently served bans for biting, punching, swearing and now elbowing.
