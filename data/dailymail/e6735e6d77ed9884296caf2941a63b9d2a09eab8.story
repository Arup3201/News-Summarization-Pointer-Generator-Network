France has been driven so 'mad' by British cycling success they are accusing Team GB of cheating, David Cameron said today.

The Prime Minister said the French had found the sight of the Champs Elysee covered in Union Jacks to greet Bradley Wiggins' Tour de France victory 'a bit hard to take'.

And the thinly-veiled war of words continued today after apparent French sneering at Great Britain's all-conquering triumphs in the velodrome.

Rubbing it in: David Cameron said the sight of Bradley Wiggins surrounded by Union Jacks after his Tour win would have been 'hard to take' for the French

Mr Cameron, pictured with French President Francois Hollande at the Olympic handball, had to endure ribbing from the French Premier over the two countrys' medals - a position which has since reversed in the Prime Minister's favour

With riders and coaches raising questions about the legality of Team GB's bikes, Mr Cameron said one French media outlet he was interviewed by 'virtually accused us of cheating'.

Just over a week ago, Mr Cameron was forced to suffer a ribbing by French president Francois Hollande about the relative performances of their two countries at that point.

Mr Hollande jokingly thanked Britain for 'rolling out the red carpet' for French athletes to win medals - after joining the PM to watch his country play handball.

But the tables have been dramatically turned since then, with France now having only eight gold medals so far to Great Britain's 22 - and 20 fewer of all colours.

The velodrome has proved a particular cauldron for cross-channel rivalry, British domination of the podium sparking irate suggestions of foul play.

And the latest row comes a few months after Bradley Wiggins reacted angrily to a French TV reporter asking him about doping during the Tour de France.

Mr Cameron, in an interview with Chris Evans on BBC Radio 2, suggested French frustration was a sign of just how well the British system was working.

'We've got a system that seems to be delivering. It's driving the French mad,' he said.

'I did an interview with French television yesterday and they virtually accused us of cheating. I think they found the Union Jacks on the Champs Elysee a bit hard to take.

'We have got a great system so let's build on that and then when we go to Rio in 2016 we can have a good experience.'

The premier also picked Mo Farah's victory in the 10,000 metres as his stand-out moment from the Games so far.

Mr Cameron, who was in the stadium on 'Super Saturday' when Team GB won three gold medals in track and field, said: 'When I think of the most moving moment for me on that Saturday night, there he was, this sort of slightly lonely figure with the team of Ethiopians and the team of Kenyans chasing him down and trying to stretch him out by having these short bursts of pace and he just kept plugging away and that last lap was just unbelievably emotional and exciting.'

Mr Hollande's 'red carpet' comments were a pointed retort to Mr Cameron's pledge to do the same for French businessmen fleeing a proposed 75% top rate of income tax.

Relations between the pair have been strained since the Prime Minister declined to meet the then Socialist Party hopeful during a campaign trip to the UK ahead of May's election.

Attempts to paint that as matter of protocol and not a snub were somewhat undermined by Mr Cameron's subsequent meeting with Republican US presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

And it was Labour leader Ed Miliband who was not only first British politician invited to the Elysee Palace for talks with the new president but was granted a rare public handshake.

Last week, with Great Britain still languishing in the medal table, Mr Hollande also joked that British sports fans could be heartened by seeing their medals as part of the European tally.

'We will put the French medals in the European bag, and that way the Britons can be happy to be Europeans,' he said.

British cycling chiefs have laughed off French claims that 'magic wheels' - with secret technology hidden inside them - may have been the secret to the team's phenomenal success in the track cycling events, where its riders walked away with seven golds from the 10 events.

And they also pointed out that the wheels in question were made in France.

Earlier in the competition, there was another controversy when Philip Hindes admitted to deliberately crashing to earn a restart of the team sprint, in which Great Britain went on to beat France to the gold medal.

Despite complaints, the authorities judged that no rules had been broken.

Mr Cameron said the main lesson so far from the Games in terms of future success was 'keep doing what we are doing, the way that elite sport has been organised and the way we back our Olympians'.

'I have met a lot of the people involved in that. They are brilliant,' he said.

It was also essential to find some way of 'bottling this volunteering', he said, outlining efforts to get the half a million people giving up their time as Games Makers and in other roles to continue their efforts with local sports clubs and other organisations.
