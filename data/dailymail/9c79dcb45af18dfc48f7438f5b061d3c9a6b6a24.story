A man secretly filmed his 15-year-old stepdaughter undressing, washing and going to the toilet, a court heard today.

Martyn Darlington spied on Jade Walsh using cameras he set up in her bedroom and the bathroom of the family home in Rhyl, North Wales.

The 39-year-old was today jailed for 14 months at Mold Crown Court after he admitted building up a collection of indecent photographs and videos of children as young as six.

Karl Scholz, prosecuting, told the court that Jade was the daughter of a woman named Caroline Walsh whom Darlington lived with and had been going out with for around eight years.

He said that at the age of 16 she left the family home but from being around 11, they were living at the same house. ‘She looked upon him as a father figure and trusted him implicitly,’ said Mr Scholz.

The court heard that police found 38 video files of Jade, which all appeared to have been taken at a time when she was around 15 years of age.

Mr Scholz said: ‘They involved the setting up of covert cameras so she was being filmed in her bedroom where she would be undressing for bed, and in the bathroom when she would be naked and using the toilet.’

On Jade’s 16th birthday, a camera which had been installed pointing towards her bed, was discovered.

Her mother confronted Darlington about it, and he claimed it had been put there to ‘check she was not being sexually active with any boyfriends that might come round’.

He disconnected the camera, but retained the memory card which contained videos of Jade, the court heard.

Referring to a victim impact statement written by Jade, Mr Scholz said she questioned what his motives might really have been in the period of time she lived with him when she might have given him a kiss or a hug.

She said she is now suspicious of people and no longer feels able to trust others.

Mr Scholz told the court that the police were alerted to Darlington’s stash of child pornography following suspicions from his partner Ms Walsh.

It was at the couple’s home in Rhyl that officers found nearly 100,000 indecent images and 365 videos of children.

‘Caroline began to notice the defendant was spending an increasingly long period of time alone at his computer screen,’ he said. ‘He would always close the screen when she walked in.

‘In October 2013, her suspicions now being raised all the time as to what sort of material was found on his computer she asked two friends to come to the home when she was out to find out what files and folders were on the computer.’

The court heard how Darlington, a railway construction engineer, also subscribed to paying websites which allowed him to access images of children.

This material included photographs of girls as young as six, some naked and some in bikinis and underwear, posing provocatively.

Defending Darlington, Guy Dodd said: ‘He was a man of exemplary previous character. That was until he developed an extremely unhealthy interest in internet porn over four years.

‘He spent most of the week, and some of the weekends, away from home and did feel very isolated and lonely on occasions.

‘He had little or no active sex life due to the nature of his job and having to work away and this led to him looking at adult porn sites which in the end became pretty obsessive

‘He stumbled across a site that featured a child pornographic image. He realises he should have stopped at that point and not taken it any further.

‘All this became fairly normalised in his mind. He didn’t think he was doing anything seriously wrong.’

Darlington admitted three counts of voyeurism and 14 counts of possessing indecent images of children.

Judge Rhys Rowlands described his behaviour as ‘serious and disturbing’ and ordered him to sign the sex offenders register as well as making him subject to a ten-year sexual offences prevention order.

Jailing Darlington, the judge said: ‘In any view this was utter depraved behaviour on your part.

‘On examination of the material from your home revealed a vast collection of photographs and videos of young children and your step daughter in her home, dressing, washing and using the toilet.

‘You treated her as your daughter and she treated you as her father. I’m dealing with a very bad breach of trust.’

Speaking after the case, Ms Walsh said: ‘I’m livid with the sentence. He should have got five to ten years. It’s definitely not long enough after everything he’s put our family through.’

Jade can be identified after she waived her right to anonymity.
