A man attacked a partygoer dressed as a Fox News Anchor on Halloween simply because he hated the station. 

Sean Kory was in downtown Santa Cruz, California, when he saw the person in costume and screamed 'I hate Fox News' before grabbing their microphone prop.

The 29-year-old then started hitting the innocent bystander with an aluminium racket he was carrying.  

Attack: Sean Kory, 29, was in downtown Santa Cruz, California, when he saw the person in costume and shouted 'I hate Fox News' before grabbing their microphone prop and and hitting him with the aluminium racket

The assault victim called police, prompting Kory to try and flee on foot. 

After a short chase he was tracked down, restrained and arrested. 

Kory was arrested and booked into the county jail, Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said in a news release.

It isn't known whether Kory was also in costume -- or why he had a tennis racket. His bond amount was also not available. 

Around 15,000 people were said to be out celebrating in Santa Cruz - with police making 32 arrests, 40 citations and responding to 400 calls during the evening.

One of the other Halloween-related incidences involved a man dressed as Edward Scissorhands who was trying to cut down trees in the area.  

Motivation: It is unknown why Kory disliked the station and police could not say whether he was in costume
