'Rope-a-dope': Sen. McCain's reference was to heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali's successful 1974 strategy of stretching out his fight against George Foreman, by feigning weakness in order to exhaust the older fighter over the long-term

Senator John McCain today said he fears that President Obama is a victim of a 'game of rope-a-dope' being played by Russia's Vladimir Putin 'as the slaughter goes on'.

McCain, who has alternated between supporting Obama's course and publicly lamenting its weakness, spoke out after the president's landmark national address last night in which he agreed to bow to Russian plans to broker a handover of Syria's chemical weapons.

'I'm worried that we have a game of rope-a-dope for a while, and the slaughter goes on,' McCain said Wednesday morning at a Wall Street Journal breakfast in Washington.

'I think if you were sitting in Putin's seat, you would feel pretty good today,' McCain added later. TheArizona Republican has expressed puzzlement at why the president hasn't insisted that any diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis end with Assad's removal from power.

Meanwhile, aides to members of Congress told MailOnline today that the chief fear swirling around Capitol Hill is that in the hands of Putin, an apparent deal to separate Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad from his chemical weapons could be a giant stalling tactic.

A staffer to a senior member of that committee said Wednesday afternoon that by relegating U.S. military muscle to backup-plan status, the president 'all but guaranteed that Putin will think he has a really long leash.'

'Not that we'll be in a position to pull it anyway,' the aide added.

Who's the boss? Putin now appears in charge, while Obama's embrace of a diplomatic path in Syria has limited America's options

Obama said Tuesday that 'It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.'

'But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force,' he added, 'particularly because Russia is one of Assad’s strongest allies.'

'I have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path.'

'I
 devoutly wished last night that the president had said what he told 
[Sen.] Lindsey Graham and me in the Oval Office,' McCain said Wednesday 
morning. 'And that was that he supported efforts ... to bring about 
negotiations which would lead to the departure of Bashar Assad.'

Speaking during his daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday that Obama's initial threat of military force in Syria 'was not designed to precipitate regime change.'

'I expect that this will take some time,' Carney acknowledged. 'But we also are not interested in delaying tactics.'

Only hours before Obama's speech, in a hearing of 
the House Armed Services Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry 
insisted Tuesday that any proposal for a Russian-brokered deal with Assad 'has 
to be swift, it has to be real, it has to be verifiable. It cannot be a 
delaying tactic.'

But another congressional aide who works for a Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said one reason why the White House has recently backed off from its earlier calls for regime change is that 'Obama knows this thing will take years, not weeks, to play out.'

'The U.S. will see its own regime change in 2017, and odds are Assad will still be in power then,' the aide predicted.

Out of breath: Kerry was in London on Monday and testified in Washington on Tuesday. On Wednesday he took counsel from former Sec. of State Henry Kissinger before boarding a plane for Geneva, Switzerland to meet with Russia's foreign minister

Winner: Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stands to lose much of his chemical weapons stockpiles but will likely remain in power, fighting his civil war with conventional weapons sent from Russia by the boatload

Syria's tentative agreement to allow 
Russian and international officials to locate and remove its chemical 
weapons caches had its genesis in what Sen. McCain called a 'queasy' 
moment of last-minute, accidental diplomacy.

Kerry answered a reporter's question during a London press conference on Monday, quipping that if Assad were to 'turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week,' he could avoid U.S. military strikes.

'He isn't about to do it,' Kerry quickly added, 'and it can't be done, obviously.'

But the Russian and Syrian foreign ministers saw an opening and played it to the hilt, emerging with an agreement that cut Obama out of the loop – and started a ball rolling that will likely take a long time to find its resting place.

'We'll never see this Russian plan put into action as it's the sort of thing that takes years to negotiate,' French diplomacy expert Philippe Moreau-Defarges told Bloomberg News.

Moreau-Defarges, a researcher at the French Institute of International Relations in Paris, said Putin's true goal 'is to play for time, to push off the talk of strikes as long as possible.'

'The longer he pushes them off, the less likely they are. I'd say the chances now of strikes are about 5 percent.'

Assad has continued to demonstrate that even without chemical weapons, his conventional arms can wreak havoc on rebel-controlled regions of Syria. Heavy artillery shelling caused this destruction in Barzeh, a district of Damascus, on Tuesday

David Cameron, the British prime minister, has also observed in Parliament that any Putin-Assad deal would need to include safeguards 'to make sure that this isn’t some delaying tactic, that this isn’t some ruse.'

Some in Congress are naturally suspicious of Putin, compounding their existing qualms about U.S. foreign policy in the hands of Obama and Kerry.

Kansas Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo, a one-time West Point valedictorian who sits on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, observed after Obama's Tuesday evening address that 'I hope this works.'

'[B]ut I am always skeptical,' he added, 'when Vladimir Putin is making an offer to help.'
