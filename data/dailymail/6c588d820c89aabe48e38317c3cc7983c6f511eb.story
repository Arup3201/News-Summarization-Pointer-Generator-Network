A descendant of Charles Dickens has welcomed a new film laying bare the secrets of novelist’s affair with a young actress who gave birth to his secret son.

The Invisible Woman portrays the breakdown of Dickens’s marriage to wife Catherine and his obsession with actress Ellen Ternan, whom many believe inspired Estella in Great Expectations.

Dickens, played by Ralph Fiennes, was 45 at the start of the affair and Ternan, who is played by Felicity Jones, was just 18. The pair are said to have had a son who died at birth.

Lucinda Hawksley, a historian who is a great-great-great granddaughter of Dickens, said: ‘I think a lot of what is depicted in the film is based on fact.

‘I absolutely do believe Ellen gave birth to Dickens’s child, though  I know some academics have disputed this. I really liked the film.’

In scenes likely to shock fans, the author taunts his wife about the affair. Later he forces his wife, played by Joanna Scanlan, to deliver a  piece of jewellery to his mistress after it has been sent to her by mistake.

The film is based on a biography of the same name by Claire Tomalin, who advised on the making of the film. She said Fiennes was ‘born to play Dickens’.
