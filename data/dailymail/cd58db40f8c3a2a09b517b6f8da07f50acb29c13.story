Ben Flower faces a suspension after being sent off for a shocking attack on St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia during Saturday's Super League Grand Final.

The Wigan prop had spilled the ball with a try beckoning in the opening minute and seconds later losty his cool.

Flower appeared to take exception to Hohaia's use of a forearm on him during a Wigan attack and reacted by knocking him to the ground with a left hook.

Grade A Offence - Fine/less than one week

Grade B Offence - One-two weeks

Grace C Offence - Two-three weeks

Grade D Offence - Three-five weeks

Grade E Offence - Four-eight weeks

Grade F Offence - Eight weeks plus, or a specified period of suspension 

The former Crusaders forward then struck his defenceless opponent with a second punch to his face while he laid motionless on the turf.

Referee Phil Bentham had no choice but to brandish a red card and Flower became the first player to be sent off in a Grand Final. St Helens went on to win the showpiece 14-6.

Flower now faces a suspension of at least eight matches after being charged by the Rugby Football League for his double punch on St Helens' Lance Hohaia in Saturday's Grand Final.

Flower has been charged with the Grade F offence of violent and aggressive punching/punching an off-guard opponent. The advisory suspension tariff for a player found guilty of such an offence is eight-plus games as it is the most heinous crime on the RFL's sliding scale.

Manu Tuilagi v Chris Ashton - 2011 

Manu Tuilagi received a five-week ban, missing the Premiership final between Leicester and Saracens, after punching England team-mate Chris Ashton during a match against Northampton.

Then just 20, Tulilagi's ban was initially 10 weeks but was reduced to five because there was provocation, a push in the back, from Ashton.

Rather than waiting for an awkward meeting at England training, Tuilagi was quick to make amends. 

'I rang him up and we went to the cinema and for a meal,' said Tuilagi in an interview with Sportsmail, as if it were any other trip with a mate. 'We had a night out together. We watched Transformers... Romantic.'

Billy Bremner v Kevin Keegan - 1974

The 1974 Charity shield match between Leeds United and Liverpool was marred by a clash between Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan who were both duly sent off.

Angry having been fouled persistently, Keegan, unaware that Giles was the culprit of the latest challenge, lashed out at Bremner.

Scotland international Bremner hit back and referee Bob Matthewson had no choice but to send both players off - the pair famously throwing the shirts to the floor as they trudged off the field.  

Leeds, managed by Brian Clough who would last just 44 days in the job, lost the match on penalties.

Indiana Pacers v Detroit Pistons - 2004 

Named 'Malice at the Palace', a fight broke out between the two teams on the court with just a minute of play remaining.

Shortly after the fight was haltered, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Pacers' Ron Artest who then proceeded to enter the crowd, sparking a huge brawl between players and fans.

Nine players were suspended for a total of 146 games by the NBA while five fans were banned from Pistons home games for life.

Norman Hunter v Francis Lee - 1975 

During a match between Derby County and Leeds United in November 1975, Norman Hunter and Francis Lee fought famously in a clash which was shown on Match of the Day.

Leeds defender Hunter accused Derby frontman Lee of winning a penalty unfairly before the pair exchanged punches.

The pair were separated but, having been dismissed, went at it again as the referee spoke with players from both sides.

Lee left the pitch with a bloodied, cut lip as both players received their marching orders.

Todd Bertuzzi v Steve Moore - 2004  

In March 2004, Todd Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks punched Colorado Avalance forward Steve Moore from behind - a retaliation hit from Moore on Markus Naslund in a previous game. 

Bertuzzi - who was banned before returning for the 2005-06 campaign - was later found guilty of criminal assault causing actual bodily harm while Moore's NHL career came to an end after the punch broke three vertabrae in his back.
