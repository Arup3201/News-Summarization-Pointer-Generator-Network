Hamzah Khan's father, Aftab, told police a year before the toddler's death that his son was being neglected. Tapes of the conversation were played at the manslaughter trial of the boy's mother, Amanda Hutton

The devastated father of the four-year-old boy allegedly starved to death by his mother had begged police to check on the child before his death, a court has heard.

Tapes were played at the manslaughter trial of tragic Hamazah Khan's mother, Amanda Hutton, of the conversation between Aftab Khan and police in 2008, following his arrest for an assault on Hutton.

During the conversation, he repeatedly told officers of his concern for his son and issued a chilling warning to them when he said: 'When it all comes out I will come back and say I told you so... you guys aren't listening.'

Hamzah was found dead in his cot in September 2011 and had been there for 21 months.

On the tape, he also accused Hutton of being 'bitter and twisted' and an alcoholic.

'Get a doctor to check the kid (Hamzah). I want you to check Hamzah, get a doctor to check him and check how undernourished he is and how neglected he is.

'There's something wrong with that kid.'

Asked if he had taken his son to the doctor, Aftab, who said he had been with Hutton 'on and off for 22 years' and who later admitted the assault on her in court, said: 'She will not let me. I've told her time and time again, there's something wrong with him, take him to the doctors.

'I changed his nappy when she'd left him for about a day and a half because of the drink problem.I can't do anything. She's overpowering. Go and live with her and you'll see the big bad story.

'It all boils down to she's an alcoholic she won't listen to anybody. I'll report her to the social services.The authorities can't be bothered. I will get the social services involved, you aren't listening.

'So if anything else happens afterwards you guys know about it.

'This is the problem, authorities, you don't believe the right people. She's a bitter and twisted woman and there's something seriously wrong with her.

'She don't brush her teeth, she don't clean herself, she don't look after herself. She's an alcoholic.'

The brother of Hamzah Khan (pictured) has told a jury how he saw the child sleeping in a buggy that stank of urine

He also confirmed police had been called to the house on eight separate occasions in the two-and-a-half years up to 2008.

Detective Inspector Ian Lawrie told the court officers visited the home
in Bradford, West Yorks., after the interview. The court is due to hear
evidence from officers in relation to that visit.

On trial: Amanda Hutton faces manslaughter charges after her son Hamzah Khan's decomposed body was found at home 21 months after his death

Bradford Crown Court also heard evidence from Hamzah's brother, Qaiser Khan, 22, who said his sibling had 'appeared neglected', and had been sleeping in a cot which 'stank of urine'. He also claimed he had witnessed the child eating the contents of his nappy.

Mr Khan told a jury at Bradford Crown Court how he went to the house between December 2008 and March 2009.

He said Hamzah slept upright in a urine-soaked buggy that 'stank'.

Mr Khan said his brother was left in a dirty nappy and he witnessed him eating the contents.

'Hamzah appeared neglected,' Mr Khan said.

He explained to the jury: 'I was only at the house for a couple of days. The buggy smelled so bad of urine I got disinfectant and cleaned it out.'

Mr Khan was also asked about a text message sent from his phone to Hutton in December 2008.

Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said the text said: 'Watch out Monday you b****. I’m going to go to the police station to report you for child neglect and abuse. Look at Hamzah.'

Mr Khan said he did not remember sending it.

Asked by Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, if he was exaggerating what was happening at the house because he had a bad relationship with his mother, Mr Khan said: 'I’ve seen this with my own eyes.'

Mr Khan told the court that when he was aged about 13, he was made to drink 'mouldy, off milk' by his mother as punishment. 

He said his mother would spend her days drinking. 'She would go upstairs and drink and then I wouldn’t see her for most of the day,' he said.

Earlier, Mr Khan refused to answer any questions when he first stepped into the witness box.

But after a break he returned to court to give his evidence.

Qaiser Khan, 22, was giving evidence on the third day of the trial of his mother Amanda Hutton, who denies the manslaughter of her son Hamzah Khan

The prosecution has told the court Hutton starved her son to death.

The defendant told police her son died after he was taken ill.

Mr Meadowcroft said he was suggesting that Hutton was coping before Hamza’s death.

The barrister said: 'The child died tragically and it wasn’t her fault. After that, she collapsed.'

Mr Khan said: 'Urined buggy - was that coping? That was before 2009.

'It was quite clear she wasn’t coping. She hadn’t cleaned the house up and she didn’t clean the nappies.'

The trial continues.
