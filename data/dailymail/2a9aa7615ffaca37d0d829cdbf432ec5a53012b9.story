A four-year-old boy who has no human friends of his own has formed an incredible bond with a gibbon, like a real-life Mowgli out of the Jungle Book.

Extraordinary pictures show Putra the tailless-ape hanging from the shoulders of little Deo Saputra as they lark about near their home on Indonesia's Bintan Island.

Other pictures show Deo taking Putra for a walk, cyling alongside his gibbon friend and hanging out in the home like one of the family.

Deo and Putra were raised
together at Deo's five-bedroom concrete home by Deo's mother, 
housewife Tuti Wijayanti, 30, and father, motorcycle repairman Deni 
Saputra, 32.

The ten-strong family bought Putra as a pet, but could never have dreamed he would become so close Deo.

Local photographer Andri Mediansyah, 34, found the ape-human best friends by accident as he drove past their house.

'Deo and Putra have lived together since they were babies,' said Andri.

'It is astonishing to see a four-year-old boy so close to an animal that is cute - but also very strong with powerful jaws.

'Until he starts school next year it is just him and Putra together.'

Black-furred gibbons, or siamang gibbons as they are also known are native to Malaysia and Indonesia.

They usually live up to 100-feet in the treetops and make a distractive call to mark their territory.

Putra, now four-years-old, will be a mature gibbon by the time he becomes eight or nine.A vegetarian, he can expect to live up to 40-years.
