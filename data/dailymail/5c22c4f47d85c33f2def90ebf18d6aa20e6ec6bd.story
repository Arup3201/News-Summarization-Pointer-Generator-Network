A teenager laughed to friends about how he microwaved a cat to death as he believed ‘it was talking to him’.

Jamie Blake, 19, put the stray, called Buddy, into the microwave because he said it was telling him his mother's ex-partner, who is dead, was injecting her with heroin.

Bury St Edmunds Magistrates' Court heard he had befriended the cat while staying at John Room House sheltered accommodation in Thetford, Norfolk.

Microwaved to death: Jamie Blake, 19, put a cat in a microwave for three minutes after he claimed it started 'talking to him' at John Room House (pictured), the sheltered housing accommodation where he was staying

He kept the cat in his room to keep him company at night and fed it cheese and tuna but Blake claims he began arguing with it before forcing it into the microwave on September 27.

Miss Atkins told the court that the teenager had then told other residents what he had done but initially no one believed him.

She said: ‘Apparently he was laughing about this to other residents, saying he had put it in the microwave for three minutes, killing it and appeared to be quite jovial about the situation.’

Kieran Dunphy, defending, told the court: ‘Here is a young man who was not in the right frame of mind in committing this offence.’

Disposed of: CCTV footage at the house showed Blake disposing of the microwave oven and a carrier bag that appeared to have the dead animal in it (file photo)

Fran Lewis from the probation service said Blake had a drug problem which may have contributed to his mental health issues.

She said the teenager was ‘high risk’ and not someone they felt they were able to manage safely in the community.

After fur was spotted near Blake’s room, CCTV footage was investigated and it showed him picking the cat up by the scruff of its neck and taking it to his room.

Voices: Jamie Blake said the cat had been talking to him

Blake was seen leaving his room with a carrier bag which appeared to have the dead creature in it.

The CCTV then showed him disposing of the oven the next day.

Soon after, staff from John Room House found the cat and the microwave in the bin areas.

Blake also admitted stealing food worth £5.99 from the Jet Garage in Thetford, on September 12.

He
was jailed for four weeks after a previously suspended sentence was 
activated and handed an extra four weeks in prison for theft.

Blake will be sentenced in court for killing the cat on October 30.

John
Room House is a supported housing scheme which provides medium to high 
support to homeless, vulnerable and socially-excluded adults.

In
August an eight-year-old put a neighbour’s cat in the microwave in 
Rochester, Kent. The traumatised animal survived but may have 
permanently damaged internal organs. The RSPCA and police were unable to
take criminal action against the boy because he was under the age of 
10.

Last year two 
17-year-olds from Teignmouth, Devon were sentenced to a 12-month youth 
rehabilitation order after putting a defenceless cat in a microwave 
before throwing it in a tumble dryer and then a dryer.
