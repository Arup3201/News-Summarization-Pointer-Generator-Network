Condemned Australian Bali Nine drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are 'talking to each other through their cell walls and with another prisoner due for execution' in a jail on Indonesia's Death Island, Daily Mail Australia has learned.

After being transferred from Bali to Nusakambangan on Wednesday, Chan and Sukumaran are being held in semi-isolation cells in Besi prison on the island.

It's where the men will spend at least ten days, with preparations for their execution having been delayed.

 Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has not signalled their 72-hours notice period has begun.

'About notification, it's a minimum three days before the execution,' he said. 'It could be 10 days.'

His comments come after President Joko Widodo reportedly told an al-Jazeera reporter off camera that the executions would not be this week.

Mr Joko on Thursday responded to a prisoner swap arrangement floated by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in her last push to save Chan and Sukumaran from the firing squad.

The president laughed when asked about a swap arrangement. 'No way,' he said.

He was determined that Chan and Sukumaran be executed. 'Look at how many die, our young generation,' he said, referring to victims of drugs.

'We have to look at the future.'

In contrast to their group cells at Kerobokan jail in Bali, the men now have a cell each but with little in it other than a toilet and tiny washing area. 

They reportedly are allowed an hour outside their cells in a secured exercise area and have been medically checked since their arrival.

They have been talking through the prison cell walls with another death row inmate, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, who was also transferred to Nusakambangan on Wednesday, although without the massive display of force for the Australians.

It is not known whether Chan and Sukumaran's families - who were due to arrive in the island's port town of Cilacap on Thursday - will be able to visit the men on Friday, when visits are usually banned.

Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja - who Chan considers family - told Daily Mail Australia prison officers would not allow him to see the Australians when he went to Nusakambangan on Thursday.

'They are still in isolation, they wouldn't let me visit them. No one can visit them,' he said.

The last time Mirdjaja spoke to Chan was on Tuesday afternoon, just hours before he was moved from Kerobokan.

'Andrew said he wanted to be in the company of his family and he said I am his family,' Mirdjaja said.

'Myuran asked me to help with his exhibition at the Hard Rock Hotel on Saturday.'

Mirdjaja said he would be staying at Cilacap for 'a few days' in the hopes that he would be granted access to see Chan and Sukuraman.

'I can't describe how I feel. It's really, really bad. It's really hard for me,' Mirdjaja said. 

This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions

It is located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells 

It is not known how the prisoners destined for execution will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan

The Australians' newest cellmate Raheem Salami, convicted on trafficking 5.3kg of heroin through Surabaya airport in East Java in 1998, was transferred to Nusakambangan from a prison in that region.

Chan, Sukumaran and Salami are now occupying three of the four cells in Besi prison where they are allowed a small amount of clothes, Chan his Bible and virtually nothing else.

They are expected to be transferred to Batu or 'stone' prison on the island and into a complete isolation area at least 72 hours before the announced execution date.

There are a total of 10 death row drug dealers slated to be executed simultaneously, Chan, Sukumaran, an Indonesian, a Filipino woman and six other male foreigners.

Indonesia is already under fire over their practice of the death penalty but pictures of a smiling police commissioner posing with the Bali Nine duo has landed them in more hot water.

Djoko Hariutomo was seen posing with the pair before their plane takes off on the two-hour flight to Cilacap.

The police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar had his hand on Andrew Chan's back and smiling for the camera.

He appeared in a second photograph with his hand on the shoulder of Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer.

Chan and Sukuraman are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as 'Death Valley', a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms.

The spot is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan, which is also known as 'Death Island', and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the Indonesian Government executed five  drug smugglers.  

And this place, up a winding dirt track just 3km from where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells, is likely to soon be their last place on earth.

Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons.

At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south.
