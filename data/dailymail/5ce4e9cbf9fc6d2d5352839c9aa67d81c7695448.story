Andy Murray backed up his stated intention that he intends to be more consistent outside the Grand Slams with an impressive return to action following his Australian Open disappointment.

The 27 year-old Scot took only an hour and 33 minutes to overcome France's Nicolas Mahut 6-3 6-2 to make the second round of the extravagantly named ABN Amro World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam.

Murray was back on court having given himself a four-day break following his loss to Novak Djokovic in the Australian final, when he had chances to claim a third Grand Slam title.

In the past there have been times when the newly restored world number four has had a dip in form and motivation following his defeats in the climax of the season's opening Major, which now number four.

However, there was no sign of that as he continued the purposeful approach that marked most of his campaign last month. Top seed for the event, he now faces Canada's Vasek Pospisil.

'I came to Rotterdam early to prepare properly, I want to do well here,' he said. 'I was on it from the start, I was quite sharp.'

It may be significant that Murray headed to Holland last Saturday when barely over his jetlag, keen to maintain his early season momentum. One of the things he has discussed with coach Amelie Mauresmo - who is not at the event this week – is maintaining more intensity throughout the year, whatever the tournament, and this was an encouraging early sign of that.

So was his plan to play in the doubles event, although that was aborted when his partner Gilles Muller dropped out with illness.

The British number one has played this event four times previously and has not always looked delighted to be there, the notable exception being six years when he reached the final and defeated a hobbling Rafael Nadal.

Yesterday was his first indoor match since getting hammered by Roger Federer at the O2 Arena back in November, a result he has already managed to banish from the memory.

Mahut, a talented player on quicker surfaces, was already sharpened up by having come through the qualifying event but was swiftly put to flight by Murray, who was moving exceptionally well.

He might have won the second set to love after going up 5-0, but let two games slip at the end before finishing off the Frenchman.
