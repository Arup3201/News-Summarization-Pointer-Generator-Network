A heroic brother and sister have been honoured with a bravery award after working together to save their dad's life, after he collapsed on the floor of their Brisbane home.

Jonathon Porter, 8, and his little sister, Cheyenne, 6, were at their Mount Gravatt home, south east of the city, with their father last year when he started having a diabetic seizure.

In what has been seen as an extraordinary action of bravery, Seven News said the two siblings sprang into action, Jonathon calling triple zero while sister Cheyenne stayed by her father's side, Glenn.

'My dad is having a seizure and we have no mum,' Jonathon told the triple zero operator, 'dad stay with us.'

'They're just called a serious low and all we can do is just call the ambulance,' said the eight year old calmly.

The operator was then able to work out he was a diabetic and instructed the children to roll their father on his side and administer first aid before the ambulance arrived.

The emergency involving their father comes after the death of their mother, who recently died of Cancer, but she left them with very important instructions that saved the life of their dad.

 It was a defining moment for father Glenn, who admits he may have not still been here if it wasn't for the quick thinking of his kids

'Our mother taught us all the right things to do,' Cheyenne told Seven news. 

It was a defining moment for father Glenn, who admits he may have not still been here if it wasn't for the quick thinking of his kids. 

'Their mother would be very, very proud of them,' he told Seven News.

The pair received a surprise bravery award from the Queensland ambulance service last week, given the honour in front of friends at school.
