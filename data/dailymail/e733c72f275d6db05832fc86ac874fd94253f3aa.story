Fear: Peter Flanagan feared he was going to be beheaded like Ken Bigley when he was confronted by John Bennell, Bolton Coroners Court heard

A householder who stabbed a machete-wielding burglar to death told yesterday how he feared he was about to be beheaded like Iraq hostage Ken Bigley.

Grandfather Peter Flanagan, 59, who is partially deaf, grabbed a carving knife in self-defence after being confronted by intruder John Bennell, 27, in his hallway.

During a violent struggle the HGV driver, who was dressed only in his underpants, stabbed and killed Bennell, who was high on cocaine – and on bail for an earlier burglary.

Mr Flanagan was arrested on suspicion of murder and spent three days in police custody, but the Crown Prosecution Service ruled he should face no charges because he had acted reasonably to defend himself.

The decision followed a pledge by David Cameron that homeowners who defend themselves against intruders should not be prosecuted provided they use ‘reasonable force’.

Yesterday, during an inquest into Bennell’s death, Mr Flanagan relived his ordeal, which happened when four men burst into his home in Salford shortly before midnight on June 22 last year.

In a statement read to the inquest, he said he had only been in bed for a few minutes when he heard a thud and went downstairs to investigate.

‘I was only wearing underwear and had nothing on my feet,’ he said. ‘I could see a big lad stood in front of me waving a machete.

‘I was absolutely terrified. The big lad had the machete at arm’s-length waving it up and down and poking it towards my face. I thought of the video of the man in Iraq who had his head chopped off.’

Bolton Coroner’s Court was told that the offender with the machete went outside and Mr Flanagan took the opportunity to arm himself.

Vicious: Martin Jamieson, left, Wesley Gibbons, right, and Christopher Troy, centre, were part of the armed gang which broke into Peter Flanagan's home in Salford

A struggle ensued. One of the 
burglars, former soldier Wesley Gibbons, swung the 12in machete at Mr 
Flanagan, who countered the blow in what he described as a ‘fencing 
match’.

The machete flew into the air and was 
grabbed by Bennell.

Mr Flanagan said that, after grappling with Bennell,
he inflicted a couple of quick, short jabs, which he thought were to 
his hand or stomach.

Weapon: Mr Flanagan picked up a carving knife to defend himself when he found himself face to face with a machete-wielding burglar

Questions: Bennell's father, Gary, asked if a statement issued by the Prime Minister regarding self-defence had changed the way police dealt with his son's killing

Bennell dived through the back door 
window and ran, but collapsed after 300 yards.

The three others left him
in the street and he died later in hospital. Mr Flanagan said he is 
haunted by the incident.

Bennell’s father, Gary, asked 
Detective Superintendent Dominic Scally if a statement made by the Prime
Minister about self-defence in the home two weeks before the incident 
had coloured the police investigation.

The officer replied: ‘No, it made
us all the more thorough.’

In a statement, Bennell’s mother, 
Diane, said her son started getting into trouble after he began smoking 
cannabis aged around 13.

Recording a narrative verdict, coroner
Jennifer Leeming said: ‘John Bennell died as a consequence of injuries 
inflicted by a householder acting in lawful self-defence.’

In January, Gibbons and Christopher 
Troy, both 23, and Martin Jamieson, 27, were jailed for a total of 21 
years for aggravated burglary.

Civil engineer Mr Bigley, 62, from Liverpool, was seized in Baghdad in September 2004.

He was later beheaded and a video of his murder posted online.

Evidence: Police guarded the scene near Mr Flanagan's home in Salford where Bennell's body was found

Ruling: A coroner returned a narative verdict that John Bennell was stabbed to death by Peter Flanagan in self defence as Bennell was a member of an armed gang who were robbing his house in Salford
