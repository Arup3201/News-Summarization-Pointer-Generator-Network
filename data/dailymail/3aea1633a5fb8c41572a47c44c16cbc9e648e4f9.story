U.S. Marine Sgt Brian LaLoup was based at the U.S. Embassy in Athens but shot himself after a night out on August 12, 2012

The family of a U.S. Marine who committed suicide inside a U.S. Embassy in Greece claims their son was buried without a heart after the Greek government performed an illegal autopsy but did not return the body with the organ. 

U.S. Marine Sgt Brian LaLoup was based at the U.S. Embassy in Athens but shot himself after a night out on August 12, 2012. 

The 22-year-old, of Coatesville, Philadelphia, had been at a party when he told another officer he thought about ending his life. 

According to a court filing, he is alleged to have said: 'I don't have anyone who loves me', before shooting himself in the face. 

The lawsuit claims that instead of seeking medical care, his commander allegedly took him out to drink more. 

Later that evening Sgt LaLoup went into an unlocked room inside the embassy where the weapons were kept and killed himself, according to the lawsuit. 

He was drunk and distraught, the court documents say.

The family believe his body was left unguarded and an illegal autopsy was carried out on the body before his heart was removed. 

The body was flown back to the U.S. where a second autopsy was performed.

The LaLoups say that is the moment when officials realised the heart had gone but they were not told until after he was buried. 

The lawsuit says: 'Instead of being honest and up-front with the family and taking the appropriate action to have the heart returned, [the] Defendants decided to lie and conceal this fact from the Plaintiffs.

'As a result of Defendants’ failure to act, Sgt. LaLoup’s heart was destroyed by the Greek government.'

After an official complaint was made by the family, the lawsuit claims the Greek government sent a heart back to the U.S. but according to the file a DNA test was carried out which found that it was not Sgt LaLoup's heart. 

His family believe officials have lied to about the missing organ and are seeking damages in excess of £75,000 according to NBC.
