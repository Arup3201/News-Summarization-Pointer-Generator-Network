A mother-of-four has died and her teenage daughter is fighting for life after a huge fire tore through their family home in the early hours of this morning.

Naika Inayat, 56, was overcome by flames while her 16-year-old daughter was left with 70 per cent burns. Her husband and other three daughters were also hurt.

Emergency services were called to the scene in Springfield, Birmingham, at around 5am this morning.

Blaze: The burnt out upstairs of the home in Springfield, Birmingham, where Naika Inayat, 56, died today

Paramedics arrived to find Naika's 
distraught husband Mohammed, 55, outside the semi-detached property with
his four other daughters - including the 16-year-old.

It is believed the brave father 
dragged two of his girls from the burning building while his two other 
grown-up children escaped by leaping from a first floor window.

The 16-year-old - named locally as 
Saima - was rushed to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital suffering 
serious burns to her body. She is currently in a critical condition with
life-threatening injuries.

Kal Bibi, 26, was also taken to 
hospital with serious injuries after sustaining 50 per cent burns to her
back, legs and arms.

The two other daughters were treated for leg injuries after jumping from the first floor window.

Neighbours said they heard the family 'screaming in terror' as they tried to escape.

Investigation: Fire officers at the scene following the fire which killed one person and injured five more

Haroon Hussain, 18, said he and his three brothers put a mattress under the window for the girls to jump out on to.

The college student said: 'I woke up 
at about 5am and saw two girls trying to escape. There was no smoke 
alarm I could just hear screaming.

'I could see the fire and I was shaking and panicking, I could actually feel the heat of it when I was stood in the street.

'Me and my brothers came out with a 
mattress, and she just jumped out on it. She landed OK, not too badly, 
but I think she might have been injured. They are a quiet family - we 
only knew them to say hello to.'

Another neighbour, who did not wish to
be named, added: 'Saima was dragged from the home by her father who 
went back it to try and save her. It was chaos. I've been told he went 
back in a couple of times to try and save his wife.

'I woke up to the ear-spitting sound of people screaming in terror - it was just horrible. A sound I never want to hear again.

'It is so sad that Naikai has died, she was a lovely, quiet and very well-spoken woman. She is going to be greatly missed.'

A West Midlands Ambulance Service 
spokeswoman said: 'When crews arrived they found the fire service 
tackling a large house fire.

'Sadly it quickly became apparent to 
crews that nothing could be done to save one occupant, a woman, and she 
was confirmed deceased on scene.

'Five other people were out of the property and needed medical help.

'A teenage girl sustained approximately 70 per cent burns to her body.

'Due to her critical injuries, the 
doctor sedated the girl on scene in order to stabilise her condition and
to enable crews to fully assess and begin treating her burns.

'The girl was taken by land ambulance 
on blue lights to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham; the doctor 
travelled with the girl to hospital.

'A 26-year-old woman sustained around 50 per cent burns to her back, legs and arms.

'She was given pain relief and fluids 
by ambulance crews and cooling burns dressings were applied to her 
wounds before she was alerted to the same hospital for further emergency
treatment.

'A woman believed to be in her 20s, who had reportedly jumped from a window, had leg, pelvis, shoulder and neck injuries.

'She was given pain relief, 
immobilised with a neck collar and spinal board and stabilised by crews 
before being taken to the same hospital.

'A fourth woman, believed to be in her
20s, sustained minor leg and shoulder injuries and a 55 year old man 
had minor burns to his face and hands.

'Both were treated by crews before being taken to Heartlands Hospital for further assessment and treatment.'

West Midlands Police Chief Inspector 
Helen Kirkman, added: 'The cause of the fire is unclear at this early 
stage - a joint investigation is now underway between the police and 
experts from the Fire Investigation Team to establish how it started.

'It's understood a family live at the 
address but all the occupants are still in hospital being treated for 
their injuries and, as yet, we haven't been able to speak to them about 
the fire.'

Any witnesses or anyone with information about the fire is asked to contact West Midlands Police on 101.
