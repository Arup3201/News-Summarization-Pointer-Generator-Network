A cross-dressing man was charged with murder of a woman who he gave an illegal butt implant.

Morris Garner, who dresses like a woman and calls himself Tracey Lynn Garner, was charged with depraved-heart murder meaning he had a callous disregard for the life of his victim.

Garner, 52, is charged with the death of Karima Gordon, who travelled from Atlanta, Georgia to Morris' Jackson, Mississippi home to receive the treatment.

Mississippi attorney general Jim Hood said that Garner had no training or official license to carry out that type of procedure.

Charged: Morris Garner, a man who has undergone some gender reassignment surgeries and refers to himself as Tracey Lynn Garner, faces a life sentence for the death of one of his patients

Depraved heart: In keeping with Mississippi law, Garner was charged with depraved-heart murder meaning that the crime displays a lack of empathy for the victim

Ms Gordon, 37, died several days after the injection took place in late March 2011.

Victim: Karima Gordon travelled from Atlanta to Jackson to receive the illegal treatment

It has yet to be determined whether or not the implant that Garner used was real or counterfeit silicone and authorities are urging any other patients who were treated by Garner to come forward.

Garner appeared in court on Tuesday wearing the court-ordered yellow jumpsuit and had his hair up in a ponytail.

While Garner said that he had undergone gender reassignment surgery, he was booked into court as a man.

According to the Associated Press, Ms Gordon had previously served in the military but was working as an adult entertainer at the time of her death.

Investigators determined that she got in touch with Garner, who worked as a floral and interior designer alongside his makeshift cosmetic business, through a person known only as Pebbles.

Middleman: Ms Gordon got the name of Garner through a middleman who has not yet been identified by police aside from the name that Ms Gordon used to contact the person- which was Pebbles

Ms Gordon travelled to New York City to meet with Pebbles. During that meeting, Ms Gordon paid $200 to get a referral for Garner.

Ms Gordon later travelled to Jackson with a friend to have the injection.

She began feeling ill several hours into the car ride back to Atlanta and when she called Garner for advice, he told her to take some cough syrup.

Deaths from illegal cosmetic procedures happen sporadically around the country. A New Jersey woman is currently charged with giving a fatal dose of silicone during a penile enhancement.
