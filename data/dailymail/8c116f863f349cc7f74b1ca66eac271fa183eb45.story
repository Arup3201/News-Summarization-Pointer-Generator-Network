Taxpayers are forking out £113million a year to fund the trade union activities of thousands of civil servants.

This amounted to £92million in paid staff time in the last year, according to research by the TaxPayers’ Alliance, along with a further £21million in direct payments to unions.

The staff figure is the equivalent of 3,000 public sector employees working full-time for trade unions, in what campaigners described as a ‘scandalous subsidy’.

Local government minister Brandon Lewis described the bankrolling of trade union activity under the Labour government as 'a very unsubtle way of subsidising Ed Miliband (pictured) and the Labour party'

The £21million is largely paid to train staff for union work through the Union Learning Fund. The biggest spender is the Department for Work and Pensions, which shelled out £15.5million to the fund.

The research, published today, suggests that the proportion of public staff working for trade unions may be rising at a time when strikes have crippled public services.

Union duties can include discussing issues such as redundancy and pay or attending activist meetings to organise strikes.

The Department for Work and Pensions had the highest number of staff doing union work in the last year, with the equivalent of 272 staff working full-time for trade unions. HMRC had the second highest number with 169 full-time equivalent staff.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said that 'trade union facility time arrangements in the Civil Service should reflect those in business and the wider public sector'

Birmingham City Council had 70 full-time equivalent staff, the highest figure for a local authority.

A planned crackdown by the Cabinet Office on ‘facility time’ had to go further than Whitehall and its quangos, the TaxPayers’ Alliance said.

Spokesman Matthew Sinclair said: ‘Thousands of staff who should be working for public services are working for the trade unions instead.

Managers at too many public sector organisations are completely failing in their responsibility to control these costs.’

Local government minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Under Labour millions were taken away from frontline services to bankroll trade union cronies in councils.

‘It was a very unsubtle way of subsidising Ed Miliband and the Labour party through the back door. We are calling time on this closed shop and stopping these non-jobs.’

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said: ‘We recognise that trade unions play an important role in the modern workplace. But we think trade union facility time arrangements in the Civil Service should reflect those in business and the wider public sector.

‘For too long there has been insufficient monitoring of union work done by civil servants during their working hours. And some civil servants were able to spend years doing nothing but trade union work. That isn’t fair to the taxpayer or other civil servants.

‘That’s why we are limiting the amount of time civil servants can spend on trade union work and introducing a benchmark which will slash the cost of facility time to the taxpayer. Any exemptions to these arrangements will be reported for all to see and scrutinise.’
