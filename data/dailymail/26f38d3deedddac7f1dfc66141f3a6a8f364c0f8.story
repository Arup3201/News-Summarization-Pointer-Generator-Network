A Queens, New York teacher convicted of molesting one of his sixth graders in the bed he shared with his wife was seen openly making out with that wife in court Monday.

As Daniel Reilly, 36, awaited sentencing Monday for having sex with his 13-year-old student as recently as a month ago, he was seen unabashedly making out with his wife.

The former marine and his attorney wife Annemarie, 28, were seen making out and caressing in the courtroom’s fourth row of seats as a judge was seated just feet away.

Strange: Just prior to being sentenced for repeatedly raping a 13-year-old student in his marital bed, Daniel Reilly was seen making out with wife Annemarie in court

That’s according to the New York Post, which said the couple ‘shared long, passionate kisses’ as Annemarie ‘rubbed his knee and held his hand.’

They would also be photographed holding hands inside the courthouse that day.

The two need not have been so desperate for each other’s affections.

Reilly would subsequently receive only four months in jail for his crimes, which could have won him seven years under New York law.

Case closed: Seen here in April, Reilly, 36, has now been convicted of raping his former 6th grade student while attorney wife Annemarie remains committed to their marriage

He also received ten years probation, however, and will be forced to attend 104 sex offender classes.

The former English teacher also saw his teaching license revoked and will be placed on a state sex offender list.

Though
his formal sentencing won’t take place until July, Reilly will 
immediately begin serving his sentence at New York’s Riker’s Island 
prison.

Off easy: Intermediate School 237 in Flushing, New York,where Daniel Reilly was a sixth-grade English teacher. He received only 4 months in jail for crimes that can carry 7 years

The judge granted 
the request of Reilly’s attorney, Eric Franz, that his client be placed 
in protective custody while incarcerated.

Reilly was also allowed to take with him a prescription drug of an unknown type.

Reilly’s
relationship with the teen began about a year ago, it was revealed by 
the prosecution, after the teacher reached out to her and said he wanted
to have sex

The teen initially only wanted to be friends.

Worst of times? Reilly's wife Annemarie, 28, an attorney, has said that she's 'standing by' her husband and certainly proved it Monday when she 'passionately' made out with him in court

In
late August, Reilly began inviting the girl to his family’s apartment 
in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens when his wife and infant 
child were out.

The girl and
Reilly used code names in their messages to avoid detection. However, 
the girl’s sister uncovered the relationship and turned it over 
authorities.

The 
$61,000-a-year teacher, who served as a sergeant in the Marines between 
1996-2000, is said to have no history of disciplinary problems since he 
began working as a teacher in 2007.

Reilly is said to have been honorably discharged from the Marines in 2000, and was a popular teacher at the Queens school.

Annemaire originally put up $30,000 bail for her husband in April. Through Franz, she said she was ‘supporting her husband.’
