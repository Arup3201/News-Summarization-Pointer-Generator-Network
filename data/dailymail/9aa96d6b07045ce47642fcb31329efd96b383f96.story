Manchester City star Aleksandar Kolarov is facing a driving ban after being caught speeding.

The 28-year-old Serbian defender was flashed by a speed camera doing 51mph in a 40mph zone as he was driving an Audi on a dual carriageway near Manchester.

Kolarov was fined £1,500 and handed three penalty points on his driving licence two years ago after being caught speeding at 48mph along the same stretch road in a Mercedes C-class AMG.

Kolarov played during City's gallant 1-1 draw against Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday 

At the time left-back - who lives in Hale, Cheshire - confirmed he was the driver but failed to respond to a further court summons.

Kolarov - who was not at Manchester magistrates court on Monday - pleaded guilty to speeding via his lawyer following his latest booking last February.

His case has been adjourned until October 6 for a disqualification hearing as it is thought he has other points on his licence. No details of the current offence were given.
