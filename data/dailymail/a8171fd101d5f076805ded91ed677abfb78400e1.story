Three men have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after two police officers were injured when a car rammed into them.

One of the officers suffered a chipped knee bone after he was pinned between an Audi and the pair's police van while the driver of the patrol vehicle escaped with cuts and bruises following the incident in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, this morning.

The two PCs had been called to reports of men acting suspiciously in an alleyway close to a Tesco Express store.

Investigation: Police cordon off the scene as forensics officers hunt for evidence relating to the incident

The three men, all in their 20s, were also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery, a West Mercia Police spokesman said.

Two of the men are in custody at Kidderminster police station, and the third, who is suspected of being the driver of the Audi, is being treated in hospital for a head injury and chest pain.

Staff and pupils at nearby Holy Trinity 
International School were asked to stay locked inside for a short time 
while police launched a search for the men using the force helicopter and police dogs.

Police are to investigate a possible link with a similar incident in Birmingham less than a week ago.

Evidence: The damaged Audi remained at the scene for a time this morning and was then towed away for further examination

PC Peter McGinn was hit by a car less than 30 miles away in the Erdington area of the city.

A police source said: 'West Mercia Police will be liaising with West Midlands Police very closely over the two incidents.

'They are not aware of any connection at the moment, but it is an avenue that we will explore.'

Superintendent Kevin Purcell, of West Mercia Police, said: 'The officers were extremely lucky not to have been more seriously injured.

Damage: Debris litters the area where the incident took place in Kidderminster this morning

'This incident demonstrates the unpredictable nature of the job, and the risks they face on a daily basis.

'A large number of people saw police activity in Kidderminster, and we hope the fact that three suspects were quickly arrested will reassure them.

'We are very grateful to those who assisted police by providing information.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
