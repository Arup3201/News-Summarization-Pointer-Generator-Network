Former Cumberland Valley teacher Emily Nesbit, 31, was charged Friday with engaging in a sex act with a student

A high school teacher has been accused of performing a sex act on a student in her classroom.

Emily Nesbit is also alleged to have sent photos of herself partially undressed to the 18 year old as well as exchanging text messages where she said she wanted sex.

The 31-year-old is facing up to seven years in jail after being charged with institutional sexual assault.

While the victim is at the age of consent officials in Pennsylvania said his age was irrelevant where teachers are accused of sexual misconduct with their students.

Nesbit, an 11th grade English teacher, came under suspicion after another student noticed the text messages from her on the boy's cell phone.

Court documents reveal that Nesbit and the teen were in regular contact for two months.

Nesbit, who was the student's English teacher at Cumberland Valley High School in Cumberland County,Â  sent him text messages that police said implied she had a desire to have sex with him.

They also exchanged photographs of each other in various states of undress, police said.

Nesbit confirmed to performing the sex act with the student in an interview with police.

Her lawyer Brian Perry said she had made "a series of bad decisions at a low point in her life."

Charges were brought against Nesbit within days of officials being alerted.

The student victim was interviewed within hours of the police being tipped off and Nesbit, from South Middleton Township, resigned her position on Wednesday.

Cumberland County District Attorney David Freed said teacher-student sex was becoming a regular occurrence.

'Frankly, we've had too many of these cases involving school employees,' Freed said.

'There's nothing more important for our youth than how we educate them and put them out into the world.'

'This was not a difficult decision (to bring charges),' Freed added.

Fred Withum, superintendent of the Cumberland Valley School District, said Nesbit's arrest had caused concern for parents and other students.

'While we know that public schools are a reflection of society, the Board of School Directors, parents, educators, the community and our students expect that the Cumberland Valley School District is better,?' Withum said as he read from a prepared statement.

'Our desire is not to be a reflection of society, but to reflect the best that society can be.'
