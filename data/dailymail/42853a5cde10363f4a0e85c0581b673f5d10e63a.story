When Nathaniel Chalobah completed his four-month move to Burnley on Monday, it took the number of Chelsea players on loan at different clubs around the world to 22, the equivalent of two teams.

Still they had not finished. Ulises Davila was later loaned to Tenerife in Spain’s second tier, Islam Feruz negotiated another to OFI Crete in Greece, Matej Delac went to French team Arles-Avignon and Jamal Blackman headed to Middlesbrough

That moved it on to 26, and still there was mystery around the future of Petr Cech, who has lost his place after a decade in the team.

Cech gave an interview while on international duty in the Czech Republic, early in the day, when he refused to rule out a move, and then made a rare comment on Twitter in mid-afternoon to say: ‘Have a lovely day/night and enjoy the last hours of the transfer window football fans...it will be interesting till the last minute.’

As the deadline approached on Monday, however, he was starting to look like a stayer.

Earlier in the day, Marco van Ginkel, signed last year for £8million from Vitesse Arnhem, moved for a year on loan to AC Milan, where he will join Fernando Torres.

Chelsea this season will have around £100m worth of signings scattered around the world on loan, a figure distorted by Torres who is responsible for half of it after he agreed a switch to Milan for the final two years of his contract.

Of the others, several were recruited as teenagers for seven-figure fees and are now generating profits for the club from substantial loan fees, which all helps balance the books in the money-sensitive era of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play.

Chelsea always argue that player development is the driving force behind the loan policy — and it is true that Jose Mourinho has little faith in the current reserve and Under 21 environment to produce and improve players fit for the top end of the Barclays Premier League — but there is financial appeal, too.

It has been a strong year for the number crunchers at Stamford Bridge with profits banked on Juan Mata, David Luiz, Romelu Lukaku and Kevin de Bruyne, which have funded Mourinho’s rebuilding programme.

Exactly how good the policy is for the well-being of the young players in question — or those from the club’s academy who find their paths blocked by teenage signings — is another matter but they are not breaking any rules, and Chelsea’s long-term aim is to reduce their overall squad of players.

Today, with the market closed, they are the most extreme example but Manchester City are also in double figures for players out on loan.

For those who failed to find a move on Monday night, the Football League’s ‘emergency’ loan window will be open for business next week.
