There is every chance that most people will hate it, but this Easter will see the launch of a Marmite chocolate egg.

The egg is being launched alongside an equally unlikely Pot Noodle version by food giant Unilever, which argues they will ‘broaden the appeal of Easter’.

The idea of mixing the savoury and salty taste of Marmite with the sweetness of chocolate is not the first flavour combination that would spring to mind – even for the likes of chemistry set chefs like Heston Blumenthal.

However, it does have a beefy taste and there are a number of recipes where bitter dark chocolate is used to add a depth of flavour to chilli, stews and casserole. 

The sticky dark brown paste has been a staple of the British diet since it was first produced in Burton-on-Trent, Staffs, in 1902. But while it has survived a long time, it triggers very strong feelings of love and loathing.

While a distinctly British product, the name came from the French word to describe a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot.

It was originally made from yeast supplied by the Bass brewery and became so popular that a second factory was opened in Camberwell Green, London, in 1907.

In the early 1900s it was revered as a health food because it is rich in B vitamins and was issued to British troops in World War I as part of their rations to stave off conditions such as beriberi, which left them feeling weak and sick.

Today, it is the nation’s second best-selling spread behind Rowse honey, which took the top spot in 2013.

Unilever has formed a partnership with the confectionary firm Kinnerton to deliver the chocolate egg which carries hints of Marmite and is promoted under the slogan ‘love it or hate it’.

The firm’s UK head of licensing Julie McCleave said: ‘Building on the success of our first ever Easter egg launch last year with iconic ice cream brands Magnum, Cornetto and Mini Milk, we wanted to bring something new to the Easter egg market once again for 2015.

‘By broadening the appeal of the Easter egg fixture, we anticipate that the new additions will drive sales for retailers by offering an exciting new product from brands that consumers know and love.’

The firm is hoping to tap into a growing Easter egg market that is now worth £365million in the UK every single year.

The product will sit on the shelves next to a specially created Pot Noodle Easter egg, news that is set to delight chocolate loving students up and down the country.

Marmite will be launched in a shell egg format, which saw an 18 per cent annual growth last year, and Pot Noodle will launch in mug and egg format, which has seen growth of 13 per cent.

One manufacturer, Kimm & Miller, has been selling a Marmite flavoured milk chocolate bar, which contains two per cent of the spread, for five years.

It has received some positive reviews as ‘suprisingly nice’ and a rating of 4.2 out of five on Amazon, however some complained that the Marmite taste was not powerful enough.

Kinnerton’s Rachel Wyatt said: ‘Easter isn’t just for kids. We want to bring fun to Easter fixtures by using these two iconic brands.

‘The Marmite Easter egg, which shoppers will either love or hate, combines Marmite with chocolate.’

The two eggs, which go on sale in February, will each cost £5.
