Customer Graham Tisdale, 60, wrestled a bag of stolen jewellery from a masked gang of robbers after they broke into a shop in Birmingham

A quick-thinking customer bravely wrestled a £50,000 bag of stolen jewellery from a gang of armed robbers - but says he now wonders whether he could have done more. 

Graham Tisdale, from Burton-on-Trent, was shopping with his family in Selective Gold, Birmingham, when a masked gang of smash-and-grab robbers burst into the store.

The robbers packed £80,000 worth of jewellery into two large bags in a raid which took just 48 seconds.

But the 60-year-old heroically grabbed one of the bags back from the robbers as they fled the shop.

The grandfather said he sprung into action after hearing shop owner John Davis plead with the masked gang.

But despite the bag containing £50,000 worth of jewellery, the modest have-a-go hero still wonders if he could have done more to stop the thieves.

Mr Tisdale said: 
'When John told them, "you might as well hit me, you’re going to kill me
 by taking my business", it hit a nerve, seeing his stress.

'This
 was happening to someone who has been very good to us. It wasn’t 
premediated. The opportunity arose and I took that opportunity.

Mr Davis, who owns Selective Gold, said Mr Tisdale's quick thinking actions had saved his 
business from going bust

'There are always the "what ifs?" afterwards. You beat yourself up and ask, "could I have done more?".'

Mr Tisdale, a service engineer for Toyota, was buying earrings with his wife, brother and sister-in-law when the incident unfolded.

CCTV footage shows the robbers smashing 
their way into the shop with sledgehammers and destroying display 
cabinets in front of terrified staff and customers.

The hooded gang then made off from the shop in Birmingham's jewellery quarter with a £30,000 haul.

Today, Mr Tisdale told how he initially thought thebangs were a car back-firing, but then saw the robbers pour in.

He said: 'It
 seemed like an eternity, but it was very, very quick. They rely on 
shock tactics, they shock you, they don’t give you time to gather your 
thoughts.

Mr Tisdale was captured on the shop's CCTV camera bravely 
snatching back one of the bags the robbers had filled. It contained 
£50,000 worth of jewellery

'My wife was diligent and dialled 999 on her mobile, shielded by her sister.

'The bad part is John lost some of his business, but the bonus is saving the bag has helped him to continue with the business.'

Mr Tisdale and his wife first met Mr Davis four years ago when they asked the craftsman to make their wedding rings.

After the raid, the shop owner praised Mr Tisdale's actions saying he had 'effectively kept him in business'.

The 57-year-old said: 'I have 
worked hard building up the business and have not taken a holiday in 
three years.

'You do all that and somebody comes in and snatches everything in just 48 seconds.

'The first we knew something was happening was when we heard two massive bangs at the door.

'It was mayhem in the minute that followed and I pleaded with them to not take the jewellery.

'I
 said they may as well kill me because the last few years have been 
really tough. I said: "Please don’t do this, it will ruin me" but they 
didn’t care.

Mr Davis, who has been in the jewellery trade for 40 years, said Ms Tisdale had 'effectively kept me in business'

'The customer who grabbed the bag from them effectively kept me in business.

'The police
 took the bag to check for forensics and we only found out what was in 
it when it was handed back. It turned out to be the most valuable bag 
they had.

'Had they escaped with it, £30,000-worth of losses would have turned into £80,000. It was a very brave thing for him to do.

'Without the bag I would have had to shut the shop. I think he saw how stressed I was and he made an instinctive grab for it.'

The gang ransacked the shop in less than a minute before making off with £30,000 worth of jewellery. Police were able to use the remaining bag to check for forensic evidence

Shop owner Mr Davis, a father-of-two, described how the robbers packed two large bags with jewellery in under 48 seconds. He said he has had to increase his security since the raid

Father-of-two Mr Davis, who has been in the trade for more than 40 years, said he was now terrified the raiders would return.

He said: 'I wish there was more security in the area for traders. The police station has closed, but this is a high-risk area.

'I
 have had to increase my own security measures. I assume a lot is going 
on in the background with the police investigation, but I have heard 
nothing from them.

'As
 well as the financial loss the other big issue is the lasting impact. 
You are always on edge and worried it will happen again, but I just have
 to plod on with what I have left.'

Mr Tisdale, from Burton-on-Trent, said he sprung into action after hearing Mr Davis plead with the gang of masked robbers

Mr Davis said that it was the act of the customer that has 
saved his shop, which he said had been facing financial trouble

The robbers broke into the store in the city's Jewellery Quarter at 10.40am on August 26.

 forward.
