Former Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett has revealed how country-and-western singer Dolly Parton helped to create the club's Crazy Gang image as they rose from non-league football into the First Division and a victorious FA Cup final win at Wembley.

Bassett, a former Wimbledon player as well, was in charge of The Dons between 1981 and 1997 and built a team including Dennis Wise, Vinnie Jones and John Fashanu that famously beat Liverpool 1-0 at Wembley under Bobby Gould in 1988.

In a programme piece written for Saturday's League Two match between AFC Wimbledon and Mansfield, Bassett makes the surprising confession that a lot of the Crazy Gang stunts he instigated in the early days, like building team morale by attending army boot camps, were inspired by the unusual source

'Our game plan was built on the words I once heard from country singer Dolly Parton,' he said.

'She was talking about appearing in films with the likes of Jane Fonda and admitted to being starstruck, and that the only way should could truly compete was to learn the lines of all the other actors, knowing she could fill in at any time.

'That struck a chord with me. It was one of the reasons we spent pre-season training at various army training camps around England and Europe. They were tough 'beasting' days, but I wanted to build characters, make players feel at ease in different surroundings.

'I also wanted bonding. I wanted mates who would rush to the rescue of mates if they ever felt they were in trouble. It was Leeds thinking again – never leave a mate behind.

'Some players saw it as a hell-hole. Steve Ketteridge hated heights, but by the end he was abseiling down mountains like a veteran. Andy Sayer hated tunnels, but in the end he was being called an underground rat.

'We sat down afterwards with army specialists and analysed the players, making sure they were not square pegs in round holes. We wanted them to feel comfortable in uncomfortable positions, so they could take this onto the field and be happy wherever and whenever they played.

We also wanted character- building. I like to think we were ahead of our time. I also had every player going to Lilleshall to achieve their FA preliminary coaching badge to get a wider picture of the game.

We had fun at those army training camps – and also scares. One night, Corkie (Alan Cork), Frenchie, Wally (Downes) and I were dropped off by the army in a remote part of the Mendip Hills with just a map and compass to get home.

'We soon got lost and decided to cut across a field. We were halfway across when a farmer raced out and started shouting and waving his arms and telling us to get off his land. When we ignored him, he raced back home, got his shotgun and started firing over our heads! We ran for our lives. Now that was real character- building!'

Bassett is still involved in AFC who were formed after the original club moved to Milton Keynes. He helped to appoint former player Neal Ardley as the club's current manager. Ardley will lead his side into an FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool on January 5 in a rematch of the '88 final.

Bassett, who won a record seven automatic promotions in his managerial career, also use his article in the programme to explain his criticisms of a BT Sport documentary called The Crazy Gang which will air on Boxing Day.

In the original cut, Bassett and chairman Sam Hammam felt the programme concentrated too much on a reputation of violence and intimidation that surrounded the club and not enough of the fun.

Vinnie Jones describes in detail an attack Fashanu launched on a team-mate though BT Sport have now edited parts of the original version.

Bassett explained his connection with the club. 'Forty years ago I had a dream. I hope part of it still lives on in Wimbledon today,' he said.

'Our plan was to produce a group of young, mostly home-grown players who bought into my ideas. I am proud to say that when I left Wimbledon, the club was sixth in the table and in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. In the side were 13 of the 21 players who began the journey with me. Brian Gayle, Kevin Gage, Andy Thorn, Mark Morris, Wally Downes, Glyn Hodges, Paul Fishenden, Vaughan Ryan, Simon Tracey, John Gannon, Andy Sayer, Andy Clement and Dennis Wise: all take a bow.

'There certainly wasn't the thuggery or bullying that has been depicted. I would never have tolerated that. I have also read that we flooded the opposition dressing room, ripped out toilet seats and blocked drains to make the place stink. Total and utter rubbish.

'Critics accused us sometimes of being tough, but they also forget that Spurs had Graham Roberts in their side, and there were Steve McMahon and Jimmy Case at Liverpool. Arsenal had a few that could knock you over, and so did Chelsea. You had to stand up for yourselves.

'Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, 'If we can sell Newcastle Brown to Japan and if Wimbledon can make it to the First Division, then surely no achievement is beyond our reach.' I'll settle for that legacy.'
