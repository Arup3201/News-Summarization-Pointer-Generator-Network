A bored mother who was fed up with her partner constantly watching Euro 2012 on television has won £1.3million after playing online bingo to pass the time.

Lisa Potter, 33, from Witney, Oxfordshire, placed a £5 bet to entertain herself when Terry Goodman refused to turn over the daily coverage of the football tournament.

And while he was glued to Spain's 4-0 win over Ireland last Thursday evening, the mother-of-three won the entire rollover jackpot in only her second spin on Ladbrokes Bingo.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I had a spare minute and wanted to get away from the football so I decided to log on.

'As
 soon as I saw the size of the jackpot I thought it was worth a go - and
 I couldn't believe my eyes when it said that I'd won.

'I
 can't remember much after, it's all a blur. My kids came into the room 
and we all started screaming. It's like a madhouse in here.'

Ladbrokes has already handed over a cheque for £1,364,745.23 to Miss Potter at a champagne party.

She now plans to treat her family to a luxury holiday and a new house and car.

She
 said: 'We're a normal family so this will change my life forever. The 
first thing we're going to do is buy a new house before treating 
ourselves.'

Ladbrokes has also reported an upturn of 400 per cent in similar cases as women play bingo to pass the time during Euro 2012 matches

The jackpot is the third largest win in 
the history of the game and is the biggest payout on a similar game in 
more than three years.

Ladbrokes has also reported an upturn of 400 per cent in similar cases as women play bingo to pass the time during Euro 2012 matches.

Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: 'We're absolutely over the moon for her. It's one of the biggest wins of all time and we've sent the champers along to kick off the celebrations.'

He added: 'We bet she'll never moan at her man for watching the footie ever again!'
