The youngest daughter of America's biggest reality TV family, who weighed just 1lb 6oz when she was born at 25 weeks, is celebrating her third birthday today.

Josie Brooklyn Duggar, who stars in TLC's hit show 19 Kids and Counting along with her eighteen siblings, was born via emergency C-section at the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

But despite facing early complications and spending the first six months of her life in hospital, her parents Jim Bob and Michelle, now describe her as 'a healthy, energetic toddler'.

Going strong: Josie Duggar weighed just 1lb 6oz when she was born three months premature but now she is fully recovered and today she is celebrating her third birthday

The family updated their blog site today with the headline Josie Duggar: Three and Thriving.

A series of photographs trace her life so far, from being in hospital surrounded by pipes to recent snaps of her on holiday with her family riding camels and rickshaws.

Michelle, 46, suffered from preeclampsia and gave birth to Josie three months early.

Eleni Tsigas, executive director of the Preeclampsia Foundation, previously told CBS News: 'It can be quite dangerous. It is the leading cause of maternal death in this country.

'It's also one of the leading causes of a baby dying, and if not dying, at least being born prematurely, like the Duggars'.

The disorder affects between five and
eight per cent of all pregnancies and contributes to 76,000 maternal
and 500,000 infant deaths each year, according to the 
foundation. Stroke is often the culprit.

Josh Duggar, Josie's eldest brother, who has two children of his own, previously told People: 'I think of Josie being born at only 25 weeks. And it makes us think about 
how precious life is and what a blessing each child is.'

The Duggars first entered the spotlight on the TLC network show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of Jim Bob and Michelle and their then 17 (now 19) children - who all have names 
beginning with the letter J.

The family is conservative Christian 
and has strong beliefs about issues such as contraception, 
home-schooling, and spending very little time on the internet or 
watching TV.

The Duggars are considered 
representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches that children 
are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome 
every child they are given.'

Jim told People: 'People think we are overpopulating the 
world. We are 
following our convictions.'

Even with their very full house, Jim and Michelle haven't ruled out having more children. 

On December 11, 2011, they mourned the loss of their 20th child, Jubilee Shalom, who was still born stillborn and weighed just 4oz.
