Rio Ferdinand seems to be making more noise off the pitch than on it these days.

The Queens Park Rangers defender took to the microphone to rap at his former Manchester United team-mate Kieran Richardson's 30th birthday party on Tuesday night.

Ferdinand and Aston Villa midfielder Richardson, who turned 30 on October 21, were joined by grime stars such as Skepta and General Levy.

Boy Better Know member Frisco uploaded a video of Ferdinand rapping on to his Instagram account with the caption 'Rio Ferdinand took to the mic and this is what happened....' 

Ferdinand dedicated a chapter of his latest autobiography - #2sides - to explain how music plays a big part in his life. He also has his #5 clothing brand. 

The QPR ace was used to the big stage during more than a decade at Manchester United but has been rapped by critics for his performances on the pitch this season.

He had to make do with a place on the substitutes bench against Liverpool on Sunday, will be hoping he can win back a spot in Harry Redknapp's team to face Richardson's Villa on Monday.

Ferdinand's start to life back in the capital has not gone to plan so far, as the 35-year-old has been involved in five of his side's six league defeats.
