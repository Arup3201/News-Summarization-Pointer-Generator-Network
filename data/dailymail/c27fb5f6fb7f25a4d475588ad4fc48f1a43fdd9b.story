Manchester United misfit Anderson has rejected a potential loan move to Flamengo. 

The Brazilian was reportedly unsure whether he would get paid if he made the move as Flamengo have developed a reputation for not getting wages to players on time.

The 26-year-old was also offered to Santos and Atletico Mineiro but they have already invested in other targets.

Anderson is among the group of players who will be allowed to leave Old Trafford. Young striker Will Keane is looking at other options while Benfica are among the clubs considering goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard who United will listen to offers for.

Danny Welbeck is unsure where he will fit in under van Gaal's regime especially in a 3-5-2 but a move to Hull seems unlikely to develop with other clubs also alerted to his situation. 

Hull also have Troy Deeney of Watford very much in mind.
