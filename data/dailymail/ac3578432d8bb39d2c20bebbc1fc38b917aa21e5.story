This is the last chance saloon for the owner of The John Wayne Museum.

The museum in Bowie, Maryland dedicated to the memory of one of the big screen's most recognizable actors will be forced to shut its doors if it cannot drum up some cash quickly. 

Bill Atkins, its owner and a real estate broker announced earlier this year that he was struggling to keep up with the $20,000 annual cost of running the museum and needed financial help.

Closure: Bill Atkins, created the museum dedicated to John Wayne in part of his commercial real estate office in Bowie, when Atkins was a Marine in 1950 he was an extra in a John Wayne movie, Flying Leathernecks

Silver screen: John Wayne, pictured, was an American actor and icon because he epitomized rugged masculinity and is famous for his calm voice on screen

Portrait: A treasured portrait of the actor shows him in all of his on-screen glory wearing a familiar cowboy hat 

But his posse has been unable to lasso any help so far and he will have to close the museum's doors on Sunday.

Atkins told The Baltimore Sun: 'I would have been satisfied with almost anything because I don't want to move.

'I was always losing money, but I knew that. I'm just hoping something will happen, but I'm prepared to move out.'

Atkins, a die hard Wayne fan opened the museum in 2006 at the Hilltop Plaza Shopping Center in Bowie. He used part of his commercial real estate office to open it.

The super fan was so gung ho about showcasing the legend and his life that he never charged for admission, instead he handed out a dollar bill with Wayne's face on it to every visitor. 

Sadness: Atkins stands among his memorabilia in the museum, he is particularly sad that he wont be able to keep the place running because he has collected photographs of Wayne most of his adult life

Memorabilia: A porcelain John Wayne figure rests on a table in the John Wayne Museum which will close

Closure: The John Wayne Museum has reached its last roundup unless the founder can get donors

Film role: Yakima Canutt, left, and John Wayne act a scene in the film The Star Packer in 1934, Wayne starred in over 160 movies, mostly Westerns, during his career

Atkins said: 'I've had this place for eight years. It costs me about $20,000 a year for everything, and I don't charge anything. I do it for one reason to keep the legend alive.'

The real estate agent tried to generate cash himself by applying to the city for a grant and even sought corporate sponsorship. But he was unsuccessful.

He is particularly sad that he wont be able to keep the place running because he has collected photographs of Wayne and memorabilia for most of his adult life.

He boasts that he met the star, nicknamed 'The Duke' in 1950 while serving in the Marine Corps and was tapped to work as an extra on the set of the film 'Flying Leathernecks.'

Atkins said he was one of a small group of Marines chosen to work on the film while 100 others in his battalion were sent to Korea, 15 of whom were killed in action.

He credits the film for sparing him from serving in Korea, and giving him the chance to meet Wayne during his six-week stint on the set.

'He was a man's man,' Atkins said. 

'He would talk to anybody at any place about anything. 

'He was exactly as you saw him on the screen. He didn't have a trailer — he hung out with us.'
