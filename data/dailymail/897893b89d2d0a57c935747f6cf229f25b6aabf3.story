Despite playing the last 20 minutes with a man light Juventus continued to control the game and saw out an easy win without cause for concern.

Earlier on Saturday, Roma had drawn level on points with the Italian champions as they recorded a 2-1 win away to Atalanta but the Old Lady restored the gap at the top and remained on course to win the Scudetto for a fourth consecutive season.
