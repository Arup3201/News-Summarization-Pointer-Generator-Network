A climber was seen on the top of a 50ft pylon, without a rope or harness, on a 80ft tall cliff at Durlston Country Park in Swanage, Dorset

For many the plunging cliffs in Swanage are the perfect vantage point for a view of the dramatic Jurassic coast. 

But for one man the view from the 80ft cliff was obviously not enough because he decided to scale a pylon instead. 

The climber was seen perched at the top of the 50ft pylon at Durlston Country Park in Dorset without any ropes or a harness. 

Officials feared the unidentified man could easily have been blown off the metal structure and into the ravine below by a gust of wind. 

There were also concerns for how he had managed to get up the metal structure, used as a nautical marker for shipping, because a ladder does not begin until 12ft up it. 

He was seen by Kerry Jury, an off duty coastguard.  

Mrs Jury took a photo of the climber perched on top of the pylon and coastguards have since uploaded it to their website to urge people not to be so reckless near the coast in the future.

The incident happened at the Durlston Country Park, near Swanage, Dorset, where there are several mile markers that help ships check their speed.

Mrs Jury said: 'I was out walking with my family when I saw this guy at the top of the mile marker.

'I double checked but he definitely wasn't wearing a harness. He seemed like a normal member of the public.

'I have no idea what he was doing up there, but it seemed like he just wanted to check out the view.

'It's quite a dangerous climb. You can't access the ladder right from the bottom, it starts about 12ft up so it's not an easy thing to do.

'Had a gust of wind blown him off he probably would have ended up in the ravine.

'I just thought what an inappropriate thing to do, particularly when it was so busy and there were so many families around.

Pylones are located along the top of the cliffs and are used as mile markers for passing boats  

The tall cliffs provide views along the Jurassic Coast and there were concerns for the climber's safety

'It wasn't a coastguard incident but I just had to take a picture to show how dangerous this person was being.'

Swanage Coastguard posted the picture on its blog and said: 'We like people enjoying the countryside, the views and the outdoors but please do not put yourself or others at risk.'

The pylon is believed to be owned by the Royal Navy.
