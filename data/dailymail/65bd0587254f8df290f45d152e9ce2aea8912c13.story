Evdokim Gorbunov pulled the spray out of his red jacket and was able to force the officer with the camera to the ground  before he was disarmed.

The 34-year-old, from Russia, was immediately taken to custody where three officers restrained him.

He demanded to know why he had been arrested but was placed in a cell. 

The injured police officer was taken to hospital in Sterlibashevo after the incident in December, where he was treated for burns to his eyes.

He was off work for at least a week, colleagues said.

A police spokesman said: 'Two men were being taken to the police station to answer questions about a theft at a cafe in Sterlibashevo village.

The 34-year-old, from Russia, was immediately taken to custody where he was restrained 

He had been visiting the station to answer questions about an earlier theft, but was forced to put his head on a counter by two officers

After a short struggle the drunk man was taken to custody. A police spokesman said: 'This is a serious assault on an officer of the law simply carrying out his duty'

'When they got there one of the two men became aggressive, and after an officer activated his camera, the man pulled out a can of pepper spray which he used to spray in the officer's face.

'This is a serious assault on an officer of the law simply carrying out his duty.

'We will be pressing assault charges and demanding compensation.'

Pepper spray is inflammatory and forces the eyes to close, causing temporary blindness. 

It can also cause difficulty breathing and coughing for up to 45 minutes.
