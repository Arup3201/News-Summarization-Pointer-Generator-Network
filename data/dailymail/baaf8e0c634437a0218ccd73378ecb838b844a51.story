A wife who lost her engagement, wedding and eternity rings has told how she was reunited with them after her husband launched a Facebook appeal to find them.

Mother-of-two Kate Hunter, 34, from Preston, Lancashire, had put the rings in her make-up bag and intended to put them on at work, but in the rush, lost them on her way in.

It was only when she got to her office that she realised her blunder, and turned to husband Chris, who runs a communications business, for help.

Prized possessions: The missing rings included a cluster ring that had belonged to Mrs Hudson's late grandmother and two eternity rings, given to her by husband Chris to mark the birth of their children Ben, seven, and Freddie, four

Mr Hunter said: 'I knew immediately we needed to put an appeal on Facebook. The power of social network is incredible and so I got straight to it.'

The missing items included a cluster ring, worth
£4,100, that had belonged to Mrs Hudson's late grandmother as well as 
two eternity rings, given to her by husband Chris to mark the birth of 
their children Ben, seven, and Freddie, four.

The Facebook appeal by husband Chris was re-posted over 2300 times in 24 hours before a man, who wishes to remain anonymous, came forward

Mrs Hunter, who doesn't sleep wearing 
her rings, because she suffers from Eczema, was devastated after she 
realised they had gone missing.

She said: 'My husband dropped me off by the bus stop and McDonald’s at Preston Docks and I think I dropped the bag getting out of the car.

'The monetary value wasn’t important – I was just so upset because of their huge sentimental value.'

Putting out a Facebook appeal, Chris set up a devoted email address for any finders to come forward and honestly put the rings monetary value in the appeal.

The heartfelt appeal by husband Chris was re-posted over 2,300 times in 24 hours before a man, who wishes to remain anonymous, came forward saying he had found the sentimental objects which had a combined value of over £6,000.

Mrs Hudson added: 'It just shows that there are some really honest and lovely people out there.'

'We offered the finder a reward but he wouldn't have any of it, the man just wanted to reunite me the rings which he could see meant so much to me.'

'Initially, I feared the worst and thought that I'd lost my most irreplaceable, sentimental jewellery, but the Facebook appeal just highlights the power of social media.'
