Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 win against Italy on Tuesday has won a lucky fan more than £500 after placing a bet on the Liverpool man to sink his teeth into an opponent at the World Cup.

Norwegian Thomas Syverson staked £3 on the Liverpool forward attempting to bite someone at this summer's showpiece at 175-1 through online gambling website Betsson.

Mr Syverson, of Trondheim, was one of 167 punters who made this bet - with one person even scooping a larger win of almost £2,000.

A slip posted online shows the bet of 32 
Norwegian Krone (£3.09) that was placed by Blackpool fan Mr Syverson - 
with his payout coming in at 5,600 Krone (£540.26).

He told AftenPosten: ‘I woke up just before it happened, so I was not awake. I saw the incident on replays. It was pretty special. For me it was a success, so I'm happy.

‘I think Luis Suarez is a very good football player, but I’m a Blackpool supporter. So therefore I would not wear a Suárez shirt. But maybe I’ll buy one for my girlfriend.’

Mr Syverson added that he is celebrating his girlfriend’s birthday on Saturday, so will spend some of the prize money on a ‘nice gift’ for her.

Uruguay forward Suarez is accused of 
sinking his jaws into the shoulder of Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini
 in Brazil, just 14 months after he had to apologise for doing the same 
thing in Britain.

FIFA’s disciplinary committee said 
this morning that it had opened proceedings against Liverpool player 
Suárez, and has asked his team to present evidence by 5pm local time 
(9pm BST) on Wednesday.

A decision
 on whether he is guilty of 'assaulting an opponent' must be published 
before Saturday, when Uruguay play Colombia in their last-16 match.

The
Tuesday night clashin the sweltering Arena das Dunas in Natal, Brazil, 
came in the final 15 minutes of a tense decisive match between Italy and
 Uruguay. Both teams were fighting for qualification for the next round with the score stood at 0-0 in the final minutes.

Then,
 27-year-old Suarez clashed with Italy's Chiellini, 29, with live 
footage showing him lean his head towards his opponent's shoulder.

VIDEO Suarez in another biting storm

Both players fell to the ground with Suarez clutching his infamous teeth while Chiellini gesticulated furiously and pulled down his shirt to show the point of impact.

Close-up images appeared to show the imprints of at least five teeth on Chiellini's naked shoulder.

But Liverpool star Suarez was not handed a yellow or red card - and minutes after the confrontation Uruguay went 1-0 up, winning the match and qualifying for the knockout stages.

Chiellini, who plays for Italian team Juventus, reacted furiously after the final whistle and insisted he had been bitten.

Just 14 months ago Suárez spent 10 matches on the bench and apologised for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in a 2-2 draw between Liverpool and the Blues.
