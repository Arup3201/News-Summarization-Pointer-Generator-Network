England face a nervous run-chase to avoid the ignominy of being eliminated from the World Cup at the first hurdle after Bangladesh posted a challenging total here at the Adelaide Oval this morning.

Mahmudullah, who had never scored a one-day international hundred in his eight-year career, hit the first century by a Bangladeshi in any World Cup as they reached 275 for seven, their highest one-day score against England, in this winner takes all Group A match.

Only a direct hit from Chris Woakes to run out Mahmudullah ended a partnership of 141 with Mushfiqur Rahim that gives Bangladesh real hope of progressing to the quarter-finals at England’s expense.

It had all looked so positive for England when Jimmy Anderson took two wickets in his first seven balls to reduce Bangladesh to eight for two after Eoin Morgan had won the toss and elected to bowl on Adelaide’s drop-in pitch.

But Bangladesh recovered so well, with the ‘mighty atom’ Rahim eventually falling to Stuart Broad for 89, that England will face a tense chase if they are to avoid what would arguably be the worst of their many woeful World Cups.

Now England, who brought in Alex Hales and Chris Jordan for Gary Ballance and Steven Finn, keep to hold their nerve against Bangladesh’s array of spinners if they are to live to fight another day in this World Cup.

They really should be able to reach this target with ease but so low is confidence after three shattering defeats by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka in this tournament that nothing can be guaranteed.
