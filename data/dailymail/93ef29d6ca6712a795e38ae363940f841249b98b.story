This is the aftermath of a very close shave for a driver whose car became wedged under the side of a lorry on a motorway.

West Midlands Ambulance service said the driver had a ‘very lucky escape’ after he got trapped on the M6 in Staffordshire.

Almost the entire front of the silver Vauxhall Astra was squashed after the heavy goods vehicle and car collided.

Stuck: It is unclear how the accident happened but witnesses reported that the Vauxhall was dragged underneath the lorry for a short distance

Amazingly the young driver escaped with minor injuries and  despite the damage to his car he was able to exit on his own.

The incident happened at around 7.40pm on the northbound carriageway close to junction 10a northbound.

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said Initial reports suggested several vehicles had been involved and that a lorry was on top of a car.

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘On arrival crews found a car wedged under the side of a lorry.

‘Witnesses said that it had been dragged along the motorway a short distance and there was a large amount of intrusion into the vehicle.

‘Thankfully, despite the damage, the driver of the car, a man estimated to be in his twenties was able to get out relatively easily.

‘The man was checked over at the scene by the doctor. Amazingly, it appears as though he has suffered only minor abdominal injuries. However, as a precaution, he was taken by ambulance to the Major Trauma Centre at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.

‘The lorry driver was uninjured though shaken by the incident.’
