Three winning tickets have been sold for Wednesday’s Powerball jackpot of $448 million, lottery officials revealed tonight.

Two tickets in New Jersey and one in Minnesota had the winning numbers of 05, 25, 30, 58, 59 and Powerball 32.

Lottery officials estimated the jackpot at $448 million with the allure of all that money stirring players into a ticket-buying frenzy today.

It further confirmed a trend that lottery
officials say has become the big ticket norm: Fatigued Powerball 
players, increasingly blasé about smaller jackpots, often don't get into
the game until the jackpot offers big bucks.

However the jackpot was still well below the eye-popping record of $590.5 million, won in May by an 84-year-old Florida widow.

But it was big enough to attract casual players who only buy tickets when they think the payoff is big and potentially life-changing.

The odds of matching all six numbers are 1 in 175,200,000. Powerball is played in 43 states, Washington DC, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

When it comes to choosing the winning combination of six numbers, some players use birthdates of family members, but nearly 80 per cent let the computer randomly pick the digits, according to ABC News.

That is the strategy that Gloria 
Mackenzie, 84, of Zephyrhills, Florida, used back in May, taking home 
close to $600 million – the largest prize for a sole winner in the 
history of U.S. lottery.

‘While in line at Publix another lottery player was kind enough to let me go ahead of them in line to purchase the winning Quick Pick ticket,’ she said in a statement, according to Florida lottery officials.

Of all the states that participate in the Powerball lottery, Indiana is the leader in the number of winners, coming in at 38, followed by Pennsylvania, Missouri, Minnesota and Kentucky.

The
largest jackpot in U.S. history stands at $656 million. It was won in 
March 2012 by participants in the Mega Millions lottery from Maryland, 
Kansas and Illinois.
