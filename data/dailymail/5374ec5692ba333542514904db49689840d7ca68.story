Last October, Lynda Bellingham died in her husband Michael Pattemore’s arms after a battle with bowel cancer.

Six months on, the property developer, 60, has spoken about life without his soulmate.

Appearing on ITV's This Morning, Michael said he still cries everyday for Lynda, who was 66 when she died, but said his 10 years with the actress were the best of his life.

'I still cry everyday but I manage laugh a lot as well,' he said. 'Now I laugh more than I cry now, which is good.'

Talking of the couple's 10 years together, he said: 'It was fantastic – it was the best 10 years of my life. And from what I can gather from her friends, I think I gave her 10 good years too.'

Talking to hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, Michael admitted he knew his wife would not survive to see last Christmas, as she had so desperately hoped. 

'I didn’t think it was going to happen that week, but I knew that was never going to make it to Christmas. But I thought maybe we’ll have an early Christmas,' he said.

'The week she died I took her in on the Friday night - we had the bed at home arranged for her and everything - but suddenly I knew.'

In an emotional confession, Michael then said: 'I have to be honest, I went to the church that Saturday and Sunday night and prayed for him to take her.

'Sixteen months ago I wanted Lynda right to the end, but it's about quality of life. That's one thing I learnt.

'If there's no quality of life there's no point going on.'

Talking of her inspirational spirit, Michael told how even when Lynda was at death's door, she insisted on always making Sunday lunch.

'One week she asked me to get out a bottle of Champagne. When I asked why she said. "Lets have a drink to cancer!" That’s the type of women she was,' he said.

Michael appeared on the show to raise awareness for bowel cancer, which claimed the life of his beloved wife, one of Britain's best-loved actresses.

Michael believes a colonoscopy could have saved Lynda's life and urged viewers to get checked

'You mustn’t be frightened to go an get colonoscopy,' he told viewers and said he believed the procedure to check for bowel cancer could have saved Lynda's life.

'Lynda had a health examination every year. But a colonoscopy could have saved her,' he said. 

Highlighting the guidelines to be checked regularly over the age of 50, he said:  'Lynda died at 66, if she’d gone at 63 every five years...' 

Paying tribute to her colleague and fellow  Loose Women panelist, Ruth said: 'She will live forever in the hearts of those who loved her. Until the very end Lynda was her exceptional self.' 

Lynda died just 10 days after the publication of her memoirs, There’s Something I’ve Been Dying To Tell You, in which she revealed for the first time she had terminal bowel cancer. 

Along with Michael, who was Lynda’s third husband and Lynda’s two sons from her previous marriage, actor Michael Peluso, 31, and his younger brother Robert, 26, a hotel guest relations manager, 300 people attended the funeral in Crewkerne, Somerset, where Michael grew up.

It was the tenth anniversary of the day Lynda had first met Michael, whom the actress affectionately called Mr Spain after the country where they met.

Talking to Helen Weathers in an interview for the Daily Mail shortly after the actress passed away, Michael described how Lynda wanted her family to remember her how she was — as a vibrant, happy and whole woman in her prime — rather than let them see her ‘die a little sad old lady’.

‘Her quality of life was horrific,’ Michael said in what was his first interview last November. ‘She was in terrible pain and had ulcers in the mouth and all down her throat.

‘Her sparkle had gone. The cancer was killing her, but so was the chemo. She hated what was happening to her and didn’t recognise herself any more.’ 

Michael added: ‘Lynda wanted to die with dignity with everyone remembering her the way she was, so Justin [oncologist, Professor Justin Stebbing] told us he would cut Lynda’s chemo by half to improve her quality of life.

‘Within weeks, the ulcers had gone and the old Lynda was back. She started enjoying life again and asked me: “Can we go on holiday?” She was looking forward to Christmas and, my God, Lynda loved Christmas.

‘Every year she bought a huge tree and enough decorations to light up Regent Street. She was a fantastic cook, and she’d lay out the table for a banquet for 25 people.

‘I really thought she’d make it. I even thought that if her quality of life improved, come November she might want to continue with the chemo. But her cancer was so aggressive, she didn’t make it to the end of October.’

Talking of the funeral said: ‘When we carried Lynda in, everyone was crying, but when we carried her out everyone was laughing, which is what Lynda would have wanted.

‘On our last holiday to Corfu in September, Lynda was worried I’d be lonely without her. She said to me: “You should go to Australia after I die to see your step-sister.” She went: “You’ve got your iPad here — let’s book it now.”

‘I said: “Hang on Lynda, have you got a hot-line to God?” She replied: “What do you mean?” and I said: “We don’t know when you’re going to die.” And she said: “Oh yes!” But perhaps she knew the end was closer than I did.

Michael also admitted: ‘The house is so empty without her, and I haven’t stopped crying since she died. I keep expecting her to walk in. Lynda’s handbag is still lying exactly where I put it after she died. Her diary is still open on the table, filled with her plans for the future. Lynda loved making plans.

‘I can’t believe that just two years ago she was as fit as fiddle. She was in better shape than most women her age, and happier than she’d ever been, and now she’s gone.’

Michael was running an estate agency in Spain when he met Lynda in 2004, arranging a mortgage for her best friend who was buying an apartment there.

Lynda, a single mother to her two sons for 12 years, wasn’t looking for a new relationship as her last marriage had been marred by domestic violence, leaving her traumatised. 

Michael insisted she visit her private GP in July 2013 after noticing she was becoming breathless while walking on holiday in Italy and cycling during a family trip to Center Parcs. A scan revealed she had a mass in her bowel.
