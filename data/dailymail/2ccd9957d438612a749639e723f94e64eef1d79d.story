Tottenham will stay an extra 24 hours in Italy following tomorrow's Europa League clash against Fiorentina to help prepare for Sunday's Capital One Cup final.

Spurs face Fiorentina in Florence on Thursday night, just three days before the Wembley clash against Chelsea.

And to ensure the players are fresh going into Sunday's clash, Mauricio Pochettino's side will stay in Florence an extra night, flying back on Friday night.

'This is a very busy period and very difficult for the recovery of the players. For that we decided to stay here after the game in Florence and train here on Friday,' said Pochettino.

'It’s very important to sleep well after the game, to eat well, to recover, because Sunday is another final and we need to provide the players with all the best things to arrive fresh on Sunday.

'I have clear idea for Thursday. Always for us the most important game is Thursday and we need to be focused on the Fiorentina game not on the Capital One Cup.'

Tottenham drew the first-leg against Fiorentina 1-1 at White Hart Lane last week and have since drawn 2-2 with West Ham during a packed fixture schedule for Pochettino's side.

Fiorentina, currently fifth in Serie A will provide a stern test for Spurs and Pochettino is well aware of the challenge ahead in Florence: 

'Now the way football is, on TV, it didn’t surprise me the way they played. We watched a lot of their games and it didn’t surprise me. We know they have very good players and play in a very attractive way. Nothing special,' said the Spurs boss.

'I told you before the first game in London about Montella, is a coach who seems a little bit Spanish. Playing with a lot of Spanish players and the way they play is very similar to us because always try to play on the grass and always thinking on the opponent goal. We have a similar style, similar philosophy.'

Kane, scoring in Tottenham's 5-3 win over Chelsea on January 1, will hope to defeat the Blues on Sunday

It’s been a damaging fortnight for football with several race and violence related incidents hitting the headlines but the Spurs manager is adamant the Tottenham fans will conduct themselves in the appropriate manner in Italy:

‘Our fans are very respectful. In the few games we’ve played before in the Europa League in Greece, Turkey, Serbia, the behaviour of our fans was great fantastic no problem,’ added the Argentinian.

‘Maybe because I think it’s better to be careful but our supporters always in the past in the last three games behaviour was fantastic. We need to be respectful and have the same behaviour.’
