A Marine who was left disfigured after fearlessly shielding a comrade from a grenade blast in Afghanistan will receive the Medal of Honor, it has emerged.

Kyle Carpenter, 24, will reportedly be presented with the nation's top military award later this year, becoming only the third Marine from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to receive it.

While no formal announcement has been made, officials told the Marine Corps Times that plans are being finalized for a ceremony in Washington later this year.

Carpenter, from South Carolina, lost his right eye and most of the teeth in the November 2010 blast, which also shattered his jaw and broke his arm in dozens of places, leaving him heavily scarred.

Hero: Corporal Carpenter is to receive the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a grenade to save a friend

He was just 21 when he intentionally threw his body over a grenade to save his friend, Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, while they stood guard on a rooftop in the Helmand province.

Eufrazio survived the attack but the frontal lobe of his brain was seriously injured by shrapnel and it took him more than two years to be able to talk again.

After the blast, Carpenter underwent more than 30 surgeries and has been fitted with a glass eye.

Speaking to the Times, Carpenter said he had been in Afghanistan for five months before the blast.

'We
 knew the area we were moving into was one of the rougher areas,' he 
said.Â

Kyle Carpenter will be only the third Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.

In 2007, Corporal Jason Dunham was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for covering a grenade with his body during an attack in Iraq in 2004. He was mortally wounded but saved the lived of at least two fellow Marines.

In 2011, Dakota Meyer became the first Marine Medal of Honor recipient out of the war in Afghanistan. In 2009, he had ignored orders to stay put and fought his way into an ambush to help rescue three dozen Afghan and American troops and to recover four dead Americans.

Carpenter will become the youngest living Medal of Honor recipient when he is awarded; currently, the title is held by Meyer, who is 25.

He said that he refused to be bitter 
about his injuries, adding: 'I'm still here and kicking, and I have all 
my limbs, so you'll 
never hear me complain.'

There
 has been some debate over exactly what happened before the explosion, 
as Carpenter said he was unable to remember what had happened and there 
were no witnesses to the event.

But troops have said they have no doubt Carpenter had acted to save his friends life.

Hospitalman
 3rd Class Christopher Frend, who was the first to treat the men, said 
the injuries were consistent with Carpenter covering the grenade.

He added that the part of the grenade that detonated was found beneath Carpenter's torso.

'Grenade
 blasts blow up; they don't blow down,' Frend told Marine Corps Times in
 2012. 'If he hadn't done it, what we found would have looked completely
 different.'

Even though he has since left the Marines, Carpenter has maintained close ties with them and has been featured as a guest of honor at several command events.

On the anniversary of the blast last year, he wrote on Facebook to thank his supporters.

'It's hard to comprehend that three 
years ago today my life and body was torn apart by an enemy hand grenade
 on a hot dusty rooftop in Afghanistan,' he wrote.

Fighter: Corporal Carpenter, 24, lost his right eye and most of his teeth in the blast. He also suffered a shattered jaw

Still smiling: He has undergone 30 surgeries, including on his right arm which broke in numerous places

'At
 times it has felt so long ago and yet, when I close my eyes, I can 
still feel the warm blood pouring out of me onto my skin and fading out 
of consciousness with my the final thought of "I'm going to die" in my 
head... And here I am.'

The
 Marine Corps Times said that it made inquiries into his receiving the 
Medal of Honor because a formal recommendation for the award must be 
made within three years of the combat action.

The
 Marine has also been celebrated as a hero across the nation - appearing
 on Katie Couric's show to talk about his experiences, and garnering 
thousands of fans on his Facebook page.

Carpenter will be the third Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in 2001.

Dakota Meyer became the first Marine Medal of Honor recipient out of the war in Afghanistan in 2011 and Cpl. Jason Dunham was recognized posthumously for smothering a grenade in Iraq in 2004.
