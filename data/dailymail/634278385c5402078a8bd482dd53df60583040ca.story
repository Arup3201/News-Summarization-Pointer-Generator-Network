TV and radio presenter Denise Van Outen has landed a colourful new presenting gig as a vlogger for British theme park Alton Towers Resort.

The
 mother-of-one is presenting a series of videos introducing the 
park's new CBeebies Land, an area designed especially for young children
 like her daughter four-year-old Betsy Mead.

And the 39-year-old Essex girl chose a 'zany' kids presenter style to suit the younger fans who will be visiting the park, including denim dungarees, ankle socks and a neon yellow T-shirt.

Blonde Denise is often pictured in girlie dresses as she runs errands around her home city of London.

And she is a big fan of the ladylike look when hitting the red carpet.

But as the face of a new YouTube series by Alton Towers she seems to have been inspired by bright, bold Blue Peter chic.

The
 five-acre attraction, set to launch on May 24, will encourage 
pre-schoolers and their families to engage with their favourite CBeebies
 characters including Postman Pat, Mike The Knight and Iggle Piggle and 
friends.

Denise's video series will see her road testing the rides and attractions including  using shape recognition skills to help Postman Pat sort the mail, 
learning about the five senses with Nina and the Neurons or learning 
about plants and herbs in Mr Bloom’s Allotment.

Denise said, 'This series is all about trading Essex 
glamour for a construction site. I watch CBeebies with my daughter Betsy
 all the time and now she will get to meet some of her favourite 
characters in person when the attraction opens in May.

'More than that 
though, it’s a great chance for her to learn as well; I’ve seen an 
amazing mix of practical education and laugh-out-loud entertainment. I 
think the CBeebies Land team has literally thought of everything, but 
best of all, I got to see it first!'

A
 spokesperson for Alton Towers Resort said: 'Denise has got stuck in 
with absolutely everything and we’re sure she will offer parents a 
helpful perspective on the new attraction. Everyone’s getting really 
excited about the opening of the area – there’s going to be so much to 
see and do at CBeebies Land, and it’s great that we’re able to give 
everyone a sneak preview thanks to Denise’s brilliant on-site reporting.'
