Not ready: Close pals say Cressida Bonas, seen here attending a society wedding has no plans of becoming a Royal bride within the next 12 months

Their romance may be going from strength to strength – but if Prince Harry thinks that his glamorous young girlfriend Cressida Bonas is ready for marriage he can think again.

Cressida, 25, has told friends she has no plans of becoming a Royal bride within the next 12 months and would prefer smitten Harry to wait before asking for her hand  in marriage.

The couple have been dating for two years, but observers have noted that their relationship has become far more serious in recent weeks.

However, a close friend of the couple said the former dance student ‘has yet to make up her mind about what she wants to do’.

‘Cressida is very busy and has lots to do. Marriage is not  something she’s considering yet,’ said the source.

‘She has just started a new job where she’s being paid the usual salary for someone of her age – i.e. peanuts – and she has found a flat to rent with her friend Daisy. She is doing all the things that people in their 20s should be doing.

‘Who knows what might have changed by this time next year but that is how she wants it to be.

‘She doesn’t want to miss out on that chapter – she’s not that kind of girl. That said, her mother is ecstatic and would love them to get engaged.’

Although Harry, 29, has made it clear to his girlfriend that he is besotted – and that he would love to pop the question – Cressida’s determination not to rush things also stems from the fact that few of her closest friends have settled down.

The source said: ‘When Cressida’s good chum Missy Percy got engaged to one of Harry’s best friends, Tom Van Straubenzee, she was really happy for them because they had been together for several years.

However, she noted that Missy was only 25 at the time and she thinks that’s really young.’ Instead, free-spirited Cressida, who recently started a new job in marketing, is busy planning her adventures for the year ahead.

In addition to hiring a tipi with friends for the Glastonbury Festival in June, she is planning a trip to Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island in the Caribbean this summer.

She will be travelling with her half-sister Isabella, who is married to Sir Richard’s son Sam.

Cressida also wants to attend the Burning Man festival, a cultural event that takes place in the Nevada desert at the end of August.

The friend said: ‘Cressida has always wanted to go to Burning Man and she’s been talking about joining a huge gang who are going this year. It’s unlikely Harry will be able to go, though.

'It is such an effort – you have to book flights to San Francisco and then hire an RV and fill it with food because no money is exchanged on the festival site. It takes lots of planning and months of saving.

‘Those are the kind of big events on Cressie’s horizon at the moment, not weddings.’

Meanwhile, Harry is planning two overseas Royal tours this year.

He is due to visit Estonia and Italy in May, followed by a visit to Brazil and Chile in June.

The latter will allow him to watch one or two matches at the World  Cup in Brazil, and a Palace aide has told The Mail on Sunday it is likely he will attend at least one England game.

On Tuesday Harry went on a ‘boys’ night’ to a smart private club in Mayfair with his friends James Haskell, the England rugby star, stockbroker Adam Bidwell, and Viscount Erleigh.

The group was overheard teasing Harry about reports that he will soon be walking down the aisle.

A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They were joshing him about planning his stag do. Harry said, “I have to be careful, it can’t be like Vegas”’ – thought to be a reference to his infamous trip to the city in 2012  when he was photographed frolicking naked at a hotel.

The source said Harry’s friends promised to ‘send him out in style’ and one of them claimed: ‘Leave it to us, you’ll be hungover for a week.’
