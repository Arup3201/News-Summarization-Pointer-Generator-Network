Theresa May last night promised to change the law to stop terrorists abusing human rights appeals after finally getting rid of Abu Qatada.

In a huge personal victory for the Home Secretary, the hate preacher was flown out of Britain from RAF Northolt at 2.46am yesterday.

The Al Qaeda fanatic – who was pictured smirking through the window as his plane took off – is now locked in a Jordanian jail after being formally charged with two terrorist conspiracies, although his lawyer says he will immediately apply for bail.

His deportation brought to a close a 
legal circus which lasted for almost ten years and cost the British 
taxpayer £1.7million. Millions more were spent on surveillance and will 
continue to be spent on state handouts for his wife and five children, 
who remain in the UK.

The Prime Minister said Qatada’s 
continued presence here had been ‘making his blood boil’, and vowed to 
back Mrs May in her fight with human rights judges.

Mrs May said she had been as 
‘frustrated as the British public’ at the length of time it has taken to
deport Qatada, who was Osama bin Laden’s ‘spiritual ambassador’ in 
Europe.

Abu Qatada has finally been deported from Britain after a 10-year legal battle that has cost taxpayers an estimated £2million. Qatada's plane left the airfield at about 2.45am

The Government has been trying to deport him to Jordan, where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999, for about a decade

The 53-year-old hate preacher left Belmarsh prison shortly after midnight on Sunday morning in a police convoy. He was taken to RAF Northholt, from where he was flown in a private jet to Jordan

She promised to use a new Immigration
Bill to ensure that similar deportations can be carried out much 
quicker and to reduce the number of appeals available.

The Home Secretary and Prime Minister
also threatened to withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights if 
cannot be persuaded to stop meddling.

Mrs May said: ‘As far as I am 
concerned, I think nothing should be off the table in terms of looking 
at how we work with and how we deal with the European Court.’

The Home Office chartered a small private jet to carry Qatada to Jordan. They had previously refused to confirm or deny reports that he would be leaving the country

David Cameron tweeted his pleasure at the news just hours after Qatada left Britain aboard a private flight

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said
there will be a replacement for the Human Rights Act ‘at a minimum’ if 
the Conservatives won the next election.

His department faces a potentially 
explosive clash with Strasbourg tomorrow when judges rule on whether 
Britain’s ‘life means life’ sentences for the country’s 47 worst 
criminals are illegal.

The co-ordinated response of ministers to Qatada’s departure shows a determination to capitalise on the human rights issue.

Qatada was once dubbed Osama Bin Laden¿s right hand man in Europe

Mrs May had been kept informed throughout Saturday evening and Sunday morning how the operation was progressing.

Once Qatada left the UK and landed at
Jordan’s Marka military airport, the authorities moved swiftly. He was 
driven in a green SUV, escorted by a 12-car convoy, to the sealed-off 
state security court in Amman.

Military prosecutors charged him with
conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts, remanded him in custody for 15 
days and then took him to Muwaqqar prison.

The firebrand was first arrested over
his alleged terror connections in 2001. He was rearrested in 2005, when
attempts to deport him began.

He lodged appeal after appeal, 
claiming his human rights would be infringed if he was sent home – 
finally winning his case in the European Court of Human Rights last 
year.

ut Mrs May continued to pursue his 
removal, signing a landmark treaty with Jordan promising that no 
evidence obtained by torture would be used against him.

Fearing that the legal game was up, 
Qatada agreed to go home voluntarily in May – a process that was 
completed, amid meticulous planning, yesterday.

Labour was generous in its praise of 
the Home Secretary, who gambled her political reputation on getting 
Qatada out of the country.

Former home secretary Lord Reid said 
there was ‘nothing that we would have liked better than to be in Theresa
May’s position this morning’.
