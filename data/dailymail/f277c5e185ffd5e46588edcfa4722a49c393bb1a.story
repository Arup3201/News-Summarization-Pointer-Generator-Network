Oklahoma Thunder big man Kendrick Perkins is in some big trouble - according to authorities, he punched a woman in the face at a Houston nightclub earlier this year and he's now charged with misdemeanor assault.

The alleged incident happened in July outside of the Nox nightclub in the 4700 block of Nett St., when the NBA star and his brother-in-law Quincy Alpough allegedly attacked the woman.

Alpough also has been charged with misdemeanor assault.

'Big' trouble: OKC Thunder big man Kendrick Perkins is accused of punching a woman in the face at a night club

According to court documents first obtained by KHOU.com, the alleged victim, Miketta Cotton, and her brother were leaving the club when she and Perkins backed into each other in their vehicles.

Cotton told police that after the collision, she got out of her car to talk with the driver of the other vehicle. At that point, she told authorities, a female passenger in Perkins' car jumped out and started taking off her jewelery as if she was ready to fight. 

Cotton says she managed to calm the woman down, at which point Alpough got out of the car and yelled, 'That's my cousin!'

When Cotton's brother, Ja'Keenan Cotton, saw what was happening to his sister, he got out of the vehicle to check on her.

When the male Cotton exited the vehicle, authorities say Perkins also got out of his vehicle and punched him in the head, knocking him to the ground. 

With her brother on the ground, Miketta Cotton says Perkins - who stands 6-foot-10 and weighs 270 pounds - punched her in the face, also causing her to fall to the ground. 

Another woman in the car with the Cottons, Catherine McGrue, told police that Alpough hit her in the throat with his elbow, knocking her unconscious. 

As the three alleged victims were laying on the ground, authorities say Perkins and Alpough kicked them repeatedly.

According to authorities, at least one witness confirmed the Cottons' story.

Charges in the case initially were filed in July, but were later dismissed. The case was re-filed, however, and Perkins and Alpough were arrested Thursday.

Perkins and Alpough were released on $1,000 bond.
