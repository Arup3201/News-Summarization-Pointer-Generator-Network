Cats are usually happy just to play with a ball of string - but not Arthur.

As this video show, he likes to spend his down time with dolphins. Real dolphins.

Standing on the edge of a jetty, the kitty can be seen reaching out to an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, as they then proceed to nuzzle each other.

At first glance, it could be a family home movie.

But the footage was actually shot at Theater of the Sea, a 17-acre marine animal park in Islamorada, Florida - one of the oldest marine facilities of its kind in the world.

And the animals in the film are actually all trained. 

In some of the frames, their female trainer can be seen sitting next to Arthur. 

In addition to the obedient cat, two of the dolphins on show are called Shiloh and Thunder.

The lagoon where they're playing is also home to California sea lions, sea turtles and stingrays.
