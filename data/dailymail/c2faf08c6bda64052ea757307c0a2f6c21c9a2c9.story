Sleepless nights could be an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease.

Scans showed that brains of people who were sleepy during the day contained higher levels of a toxic protein called beta-amyloid.

A hallmark of Alzheimer’s, it interferes with brain function, disrupting memory, mood and behaviour.

Researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison asked 98 people aged between 50 and 73 to fill in a questionnaire about their quality of sleep.The volunteers also underwent brain scans. 

Those who tossed and turned at night or were sleepy during the day had more beta-amyloid in parts of the brain ravaged by Alzheimer’s. 

More research is needed to work out if people sleep badly because they are in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. 

Or if, in fact a lack of rest actually feeds the disease.

If this is the case and loss of sleep is damaging the brain, finding ways of improving people’s quality of sleep could help keep the brain healthy into old age.

Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and, worldwide, the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages.

With no cure for dementia and existing drugs of limited use, the Prime Minister David Cameron has described dementia as ‘the key health challenge of this generation’.

Dr Clare Walton, of Alzheimer’s Society, said it wasn’t known if the amounts of beta-amyloid found in the scans would be enough to trigger memory loss

The study, presented at the American College of Nueropsychopharmacology’s  annual conference, is one of several recent pieces of research to link lack of sleep with beta-amyloid levels. 

Dr Clare Walton, of Alzheimer’s Society, said it wasn’t known if the amounts of beta-amyloid found in the scans would be enough to trigger memory loss.

She said: ‘Some elderly people have amyloid plaques in their brains but never go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease, so it is far too early to say whether the amount of sleep you regularly get is important in the development of dementia and those who have a bad night’s sleep should not worry.

‘Take regular exercise, eat a healthy diet and avoid smoking to help keep your brain healthy.’
