Jolyon Palmer is extremely confident he will compete in Formula One after becoming the first Briton since Lewis Hamilton in 2006 to win the GP2 title.

Palmer - the son of Jonathan Palmer, who competed in 83 grands prix between 1983 and 1989 - clinched the championship in style with victory in the feature race at Russia's Sochi Autodrom on Saturday.

It was the 23-year-old's fourth win of the season, and 11th podium of his fourth campaign in GP2, and now there is only one goal.

'Formula One! I'm confident,' said Palmer, from Horsham in Sussex.

'The first priority was to win GP2, and I was always confident if I did win GP2 I was going to be in Formula One.

'Now that's done and I'm confident I'll be in Formula One. I'm not saying it is going to be easy, but this title is a big help.

'We're going to have to wait for a few weeks and see what happens, but I feel ready for it. I'm driving at the top of my game right now.

'GP2 is the perfect series to feed into Formula One - the same tyres, the same tracks, the cars are even now a similar speed, especially into the corners.

'I feel absolutely ready for it and I am confident it can happen.'

Palmer is the 10th GP2 champion since F1's feeder series began in 2005, and of the previous nine, six have graduated to the upper echelon of motorsport.

Whatever the future holds for Palmer, he knows no one can take away his success this season.

The DAMS driver added: 'We fought for every pole and every feature race win. We barely made any mistakes.

'It's been an absolute dream season and to be champion at the earliest opportunity for me is the icing on the cake.'

British motorsport could be celebrating a double triumph in Russia this weekend as 21-year-old Alex Lynn is on the brink of being crowned GP3 champion.

Jolyon will be boosted by the fact that six of nine previous GP2 winners have gone on to race in F1

Lynn - from Great Dunmow in Essex and who is currently on Red Bull's books as one of their junior drivers - is 52 points clear of his nearest rivals.

Three of the four past GP3 champions have gone on to race in F1 - Esteban Gutierrez, Valtteri Bottas and Daniil Kvyat.

Kvyat notably jumped straight from GP3 into F1 after his triumph last season, and there is every chance Lynn could do the same.

There is currently a vacancy at Toro Rosso after the young Russian was recently announced as Sebastian Vettel's replacement at Red Bull, with the four-time champion on his way to Ferrari.
