Child sex offences: Paediatric haematologist Dr Myles Bradbury, 41, of Herringswell, Suffolk

A married children’s doctor today pleaded guilty to a string of sexual offences against cancer sufferers in his care aged as young as eight.

Dr Myles Bradbury, 41, of Herringswell, Suffolk, admitted to seven counts of sexual assault and 12 of engaging in sexual activity with a child.

He also pleaded guilty to three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

The 41-year-old was a paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. He abused young patients to carry out examinations purely for his own sexual gratification and with no medical justification whatsoever.

Police later revealed that Bradbury had filmed one of his young victims as he examined him for his sexual gratification.

And police officers warned today that there were likely to be more victims - as the mother of a young leukaemia patient treated by Bradbury who has since died said she will never know if he was also abused.

As well as Addenbrooke's, he has worked in other cities, including Birmingham, police said.

Bradbury’s 18 known victims were aged between eight to 17 - and he carried out the abuse between 2009 and last year.

Wearing a dark suit and blue tie in court today, Bradbury also pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism, one of making 16,629 indecent images and another of making 20 indecent films of children. The offences involved 18 complainants, prosecutor John Farmer said.  They date back to 2009.

Bradbury - who lived in a four-bedroom detached house worth £370,000 - was bailed at Cambridge Crown Court and told he would have to sign the sex offenders register. 

He pleaded not guilty to a count of sexual activity with a child and a count of sexual assault.

Judge Gareth Hawkesworth said these two offences will probably remain on file. No date for sentencing was given but the judge told Bradbury to expect a 'substantial' jail sentence.

As he left court, Bradbury told reporters: 'I'm so sorry.' He refused to answer further questions.

Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said the devious medic 'groomed' colleagues to keep his abuse secret.

He said: 'This man worked very hard to cultivate the environment to abuse young people.

'I think he groomed his colleagues. I make no criticism of his colleagues at all for not knowing what was happening.

'This is a person who went the extra mile to see young people outside his consultation hours.

'I believe he deliberately cultivated an air of being helpful, caring and someone who if he said to you, do you mind stepping out of the room you wouldn’t question it, you just think of course doctor.

'Over the years I’ve dealt with a lot of health professionals who have been in a position of trust and abused it but in this case some of the victims were extremely ill and they were vulnerable young people.

'I think the thought that someone who’s taken advantage of that is extremely distressing for people.'

Det Supt Ridgway added that there may be other victims who have yet to come forward, and a helpline has been set up.

It is understood that Bradbury worked in Birmingham before moving to Addenbrooke’s Hospital.

Det
 Sup Ridgeway said: 'He’s worked in a number of places and we have 
spoken to a number of other health institutions including Birmingham.

'As far as we know all the offences happened in Addenbrooke’s.

'But
 we’re certainly open to the possibility that there are other victims 
and we would advise them to contact the hospital or health provider and 
ask for some reassurance or support that the examinations your child had
 was the right examination.'

Dr
 Keith McNeil, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS 
Trust, which runs Addenbrooke's, said: ‘It is hard to put into words 
just how saddened we are that this situation has occurred, and our most 
abject and sincere apologies go out to any and all of our patients and 
their families who are affected by this in any way.

‘As
 chief executive of the trust, I am so deeply sorry these incidents have
 happened and I am also deeply saddened, as a doctor, that one of my own
 profession has placed himself and his patients in this position.

'There is a very ancient and sacred trust that exists between a doctor and his patients and, quite frankly, it sickens me to think that trust has been breached.’

Ann-Marie Ingle, the trust's chief 
nurse said: ‘I cannot begin to express how sorry I and all of my 
colleagues are for the distress that Myles Bradbury's abuse caused to 
patients and their families. 

The mother of a leukaemia patient who was treated by Bradbury today said she will never know if he was also abused.

Claire Yeoman's son Declan, who was treated for 14 months at Addenbrooke’s before his death, was not one of Bradbury’s victims named in court.

But his mother told BBC Look East: ‘It made me feel physically ill.

'Obviously you think “was your child involved?” Could you have noticed anything? Was there anything you missed?

‘So you go through every single day of his treatment and basically relive the whole memory of 18 months.’

'Our thoughts, and ongoing support, are with the families and children who are affected by these charges.

‘His
 cold and calculating abuse of trust has deeply shocked us all, 
including staff who worked alongside him to care for these vulnerable 
and sick children.

'As
 soon as we were alerted, we took immediate action to suspend him from 
clinical practice and we have worked closely with the police and the 
NSPCC over these past months.

‘The
 actions of one individual should not taint the public's trust in the 
NHS and the care it provides.

'I would like to reassure patients and 
families that our staff working in children's services here at Cambridge University Hospital continue to provide the care which our patients expect and can rely on.’

Detective Sergeant Shane Fasey said Bradbury had been interviewed three times but refused to say anything.

He
 said: ‘Bradbury's offences were an appalling breach of trust committed 
against vulnerable victims who had been placed in his care.

Ann-Marie Ingle, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust chief nurse

‘The
 families believed the boys were in his safe hands but they were 
actually being abused by Bradbury, who carried out examinations purely 
for his own sexual gratification and with no medical justification 
whatsoever.

‘I would 
like to praise the victims and their families who have shown the bravery
 to come forward and help bring Bradbury to account.

‘This
 has been a complex and challenging investigation, which involved 
working closely with Cambridge University Hospitals to gather the 
evidence to bring a case to court.’
