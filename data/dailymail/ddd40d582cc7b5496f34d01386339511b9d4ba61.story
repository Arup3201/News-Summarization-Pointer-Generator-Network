'He's done a couple of little things. He's changed the music in the dressing room, and been at the back of the bus pulling the strings,' Gerrard said.

'He's got a bit to prove. He's a lot like [Daniel] Sturridge in that way when he arrived, seeing if Liverpool is the right club for him.

'We'll have to see if he behaves himself and performs. That's what everyone's thinking and I'm no different.

'He certainly has the talent and the ability. I’ve trained with him two or three times. He’s got a great touch, he’s quick, he’s got the movement. He’s got everything in the bag.'
