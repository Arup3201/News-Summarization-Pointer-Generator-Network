A woman whose eleven-month-old daughter was raped and killed by her then-boyfriend in 1997 does not want the Oklahoma man responsible to be executed, it has emerged.

Shonda Waller said death row inmate Charles Warner should instead spend the rest of his life behind bars in a recent interview with KFOR.

'If they truly want to honor me, then they will do away with the death penalty for him, and they will give him life in prison without the possibility of parole, because that's the only thing that's gonna honor me,' she told the affiliate station. 'I can only see him spending the rest of his life in prison and dying in prison, without him ever walking out of those cell walls.'

Warner, whose execution is planned for this January, was convicted of both rape as well as first-degree murder two years after his 1997 arrest, KFOR reported.

He was prosecuted by Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney Lou Keel that year, as well as in 2002 and 2003, according to the affiliate station.

Keel told KFOR 'Charles Warner was convicted twice by juries and given the death penalty each time and given 75 years for the sexual assault.'

Keel also said of Warner 'This person doesn’t deserve to live. If you’re going to have a death penalty, if there are going to be some crimes, some homicides, that are so atrocious... then the rape and the brutal murder of a child has to qualify.'

Shonda Waller opposed the death penalty for Warner while she spoke in a March 2014 clemency hearing, the affiliate station reported. 

Death row inmate: Charles Warner's execution is planned for this January 

She told KFOR 'I don't see any justice in just sentencing someone to die. To me, the justice is in someone living with what they have done to you, to your family, and having to live with that for the rest of their life, knowing that they'll never walk out those bars.'

ACLU Legal Director Brad Henderson supported Waller's views, telling the affiliate station 'I think she hits it right on the head when she says you know what, this person took life, this person murdered. This person killed. Now we’re just doing the same thing in my baby’s name. That’s wrong. That’s fundamentally wrong.

Speaking about the death penalty, Waller also told KFOR 'That would dishonor my daughter; it would dishonor me and everything and I believe in. Um, I wouldn't want to have to know about something like that because I wouldn't want to know that my hand or what I went through personally is the reason why he's no longer living. When he dies, I want it to be because it's his time, not because he's been executed due to what happened to me and my child.

'And I don't want that on my hands. I makes me feel like I'm no different than him, and I don't want to feel that way.'
