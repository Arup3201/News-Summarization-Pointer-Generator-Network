A former high school teacher faces up to two years in jail after buying the ‘morning after’ contraceptive pill for one of her 16-year-old students.

Tracy Steinberg, 32, an LBJ High School maths teacher and basketball coach in Austin, Texas, bought the emergency pill for the pupil, police said.

The girl was worried about pregnancy after having unprotected sex with her boyfriend and allegedly paid Steinberg to buy two contraceptive pills.

Charge: Tracy Steinberg, 32, an LBJ High School maths teacher and basketball coach in Austin, Texas, bought a 'morning after' pill for a pupil, police said

‘A teacher in essence, I guess, believes she's helping the student,’ a police spokesman told The Austin Statesman. ‘In reality, it's a parental decision.’

Steinberg allegedly told the teenage girl that she had a positive future, as did her boyfriend, and could help her out by getting the pill.

After the student gave her money, Steinberg allegedly returned with the pills and a Sprite drink. The student kept the box to avoid any trouble.

But she soon suffered from dizziness and back pain. The girl texted Steinberg about the symptoms, reported Fox affiliate KTBC.

Education: Steinberg had been at LBJ High School since August 2010 and was well-liked after taking her girls to a state basketball tournament last year

However Steinberg allegedly told her they were normal and advised she ‘take a hot shower and relax’, reported The Statesman.

But the girl was concerned about the symptoms so told her mother what happened, who reported everything to school police.

Girls aged under 17 need a prescription for the ‘morning after’ pill. Steinberg was put on paid leave but eventually resigned last Wednesday.

‘I still love and care about all my students,’ Ms Steinberg told The  Statesman. ‘I always put their needs before my own.’

Police spokesman: Eric Mendez said the teacher believed 'in essence' that she was helping the pupil, but it should be a 'parental decision' in reality

The ‘morning after’ pill, which was given to the girl last month, is used by women to prevent the implantation of a fertile egg.

Steinberg is out on a $15,000 bond but faces up to two years in jail if convicted of dangerous drug delivery, reported CBS affiliate KHOU.

‘It was a very unique case,’ the police spokesman told The Statesman. ‘We had to make sure that we looked at every angle and possibility.’

Steinberg confessed that she provided the girl with the pills, police said.
