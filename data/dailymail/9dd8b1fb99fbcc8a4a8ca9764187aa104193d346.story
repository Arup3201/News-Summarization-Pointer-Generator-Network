An Indonesian woman accused of ordering the murder of her wealthy Australian husband is claiming to be of another religion so she won't lose her inheritance, a lawyer says.

Noor Ellis, 45, is facing charges carrying the death penalty after allegedly paying her maid's boyfriend to kill Robert Ellis, 60.

The successful businessman's body was found in a Bali rice field in October 2014. Ellis told police her husband had neglected her and was denying her money she was entitled to - a claim that shocked family and friends who knew the couple.

The lawyer for their two sons, Any Aryani, says even as she faces the death penalty, Ellis is making moves to protect her inheritance.

Ms Any says Ellis is now stating her religion is Hindu, even though official documents say she's Muslim.

Under family law, which closely follows religious custom in Indonesia, if a Muslim woman is convicted of her husband's murder, she loses her rights to benefit from it.

'If Noor thinks "I killed, I've been punished, but my inheritance rights remain", well that's not possible,' Ms Any told AAP.

'We have prepared for that.

'As soon as the court states Noor is guilty of killing her husband, we will take legal measures that will ensure Noor will not get even the smallest bit of Bob's fortune.' 

Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids

If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty

Ms Any says she's confident Mr Ellis's Perth-based sons Peter and John will be well provided for.

The young men say they will support the court's decision if it sentences their mother to death for the crime, because they just want justice done.

Peter Ellis learned about his father's death via the internet, and hopes to be better informed about the trial process as it continues.

Police allege Noor Ellis paid a man known as Aril, the boyfriend of her maid, $A14,000 to kill Mr Ellis. They allege Aril and four others slashed Mr Ellis' throat in the kitchen of his villa while his wife was in another room. The trial last week heard from a friend of Noor Ellis who lent her the money to pay the killer.

Police move Noor Ellis from her detention centre cell to an investigation room in the Crime Detectives Division of Bali Provincial Police on October 27

Ni Luh Yoskana Darmada thought the Rp 50 million was to buy ceramics for Ellis' hotel development.

'I was terrified,' she told the court.

'A week after she borrowed the money the police came.'

Police officer Wayan Sujana told the court that when he informed Ellis that her husband's body had been found, her expression was 'like that of a sick person'. 

Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife

Robert and Noor's sons, Peter (left) and John (right) text messaged their mother (centre) the night he disappeared to ask where their father was

'The defendant said she knew nothing of the incident,' he said.

Police then examined the maid's text messages and found one from Aril that said: 'Danger, I just want to go back home'.

He was caught trying to flee to his native island of Sumba.

Ellis' trial resumes in Bali on Wednesday.
