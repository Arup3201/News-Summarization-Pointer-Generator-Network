Worried about those Christmas presents not reaching relatives on time?

Look away now.

This is the moment a couple driving through Colorado spotted a FedEx van tearing down the highway with its back door open - and packages tumbling out. 

Look out! The Dickson Family were forced to swerve around at least four packages falling out a FedEx van

Let's hope it's not fragile... Boxes and letters tumbled onto the Colorado highway just days before Christmas 

Concerns: The footage will no doubt alarm the millions of families who use FedEx to deliver festive gifts

The pair skirted around four presents before the driver eventually realized they were trying to flag him down. 

Thankfully, he looks shocked and appears to start turning the van around to go back.

Let's just hope there was nothing fragile among there. 

The footage will no doubt shock millions of FedEx users, who treat the mail service as a sure-fire way to get last-minute gifts across the country - and across the globe - on time. 

There goes another: As the driver flashed his lights repeatedly, this letter flew in their direction

Teetering: They could see a number of packages perilously balancing on the edge of the open truck

And another: This smaller package also flew out the door as the driver swung round a bend in the road

Flashing his lights, the driver tells viewers he has already run over four parcels when a large brown box, a smaller brown box, and a letter come flying out onto the tarmac. 

It takes more than 60 seconds for their signals to finally get recognized. 

And as they pull up beside the van, viewers get a close up view of even more packages perilously teetering on the edge.

Could have been more: As they pulled up, YouTube viewers got a view of even more packages hanging out

Alarmed: The driver looked shocked and thanked the passers-by when they explained the situation
