Monday evening is set to see Earth's closet call with an asteroid until 2027. 

The asteroid, designated 2004 BL86, will safely pass about three times the distance of Earth to the moon on January 26 - so close.

It will be the closest by any known space rock this large until asteroid 1999 AN10 flies past Earth in 2027.

Where to watch: Observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa have the best seats for seeing this interloper during its brightest time: from 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday evening, January 26th, until about 1 a.m. EST on the 27th.

Observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa have the best seats for seeing this interloper during its brightest time: from 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday evening, January 26th, until about 1 a.m. EST on the 27th. 

During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer. It skims the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) from about midnight to 12:30 a.m. EST.

From its reflected brightness, astronomers estimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile (0.5 kilometers) in size. 

At the time of its closest approach on January 26, the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth.

'Monday, January 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 BL86 will get to Earth for at least the next 200 years,' said Don Yeomans, who is retiring as manager of NASA's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, after 16 years in the position. 

'And while it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.'

Because it's relatively large, 2004 BL86 will brighten rapidly as it approaches Earth. 

But this object should be bright enough to follow with a 3- or 4-inch-diameter telescope as it moves among the stars. 

'To track down the asteroid, you'll need a detailed star chart that shows the exact path of 2004 BL86,' explains Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine. 'Our charts were specially prepared for this event.'

The asteroid's closest approach to Earth actually occurs hours earlier, around 11 a.m. EST on the 26th. 

lmost exactly when it becomes brightest (about 9th magnitude), asteroid 2004 BL86 skirts very close to the Beehive Cluster, M44. During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer. It skims the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) from about midnight to 12:30 a.m. EST.

The asteroid orbits the Sun every 1.84 years. 

It was discovered 11 years ago by the LINEAR telescope in New Mexico, which was designed to hunt for such objects. 

Despite the asteroid's two close visits then and now, it won't approach Earth again this closely for another 200 years. 

Astronomers have also assigned this asteroid a permanent number, 357439, but it has not yet been named.

But at that time it's predicted to be somewhat dimmer, about magnitude 10, because Earth will see only a portion of its illuminated side. 

The asteroid brightens, despite the increasing distance, because we're seeing its face become more fully illuminated. 

'One good technique for fast-movers like 2004 BL86 is to identify and lock onto a star along its path,' explains Kelly Beatty, also a Sky & Telescope senior editor. 

'Then just watch at the time that the asteroid is predicted to pass by that particular star.'

One way NASA scientists plan to learn more about 2004 BL86 is to observe it with microwaves.

NASA's Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico will attempt to acquire science data and radar-generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to Earth.

'When we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer Lance Benner of JPL, the principal investigator for the Goldstone radar observations of the asteroid. 

'At present, we know almost nothing about the asteroid, so there are bound to be surprises.'

Asteroid 2004 BL86 was initially discovered on Jan. 30, 2004 by a telescope of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) survey in White Sands, New Mexico.

The asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars.

'I may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said Yeomans. 

'Asteroids are something special. Not only did asteroids provide Earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. 

'They will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. There is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up.'
