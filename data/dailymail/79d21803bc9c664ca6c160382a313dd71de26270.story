Hundreds of Scouts, guides, police cadets and other youth clubs are to be set up in deprived areas as part of a £10million scheme to improve life chances and cut crime.

Ministers want to bring them in to inner cities in a joint initiative between the Government and Youth United, an umbrella organisation for uniformed groups.

The move will see some 2,700 volunteers trained to lead 400 groups across England in areas such as Hackney in east London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bradford and Middlesbrough.

The plan is to provide 10,000 more places for youths, including offenders, disruptive schoolchildren, children in care, and the unemployed.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell is due to announce details of the initiative in Tottenham, north London, where the riots started last summer, according to The Times.

The area is set to host the first clubs – such as police, fire and ambulance cadets.

Mr Stunell said: ‘If you go into middle-class areas you find middle-class scout groups and other uniformed youth clubs, but if you go to Tottenham they are much thinner on the ground.

‘Uniformed organisations give youngsters life skills, and, for some, the vital extra ingredient for them to make a success of their lives,’ he added. ‘They teach them to contribute to society rather than taking from it.’

Tottenham, which went up in flames during the unrest last year, is set to host the first clubs, such as police, fire and ambulance cadets

Groups said to be involved include the Boys’ Brigade, St John Ambulance, Scouts, Girlguiding UK, Army Cadets and Air Training Corps. Spaces in fire stations, police stations and public buildings could be used to run the clubs.

The Government is expected to earmark £10million to fund the plan until 2015, with the youth clubs pledging to find £5million to make it sustainable in the longer term.

Roderick Jarman, former deputy assistant commissioner for the Metropolitan Police, said information from the Office for National Statistics covering crime, teenage pregnancies, income and educational achievement were being used to identify the 400 sites.
