Police investigating the death of a six-year-old girl strongly considered the possibility that she intentionally killed herself, it has emerged.

Kendrea Johnson was found dead with a rope around her neck at her foster home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota on December 27.

Officers this week said the manner of the schoolgirl’s death could not be determined – but records have emerged suggesting those investigating the tragedy thought it was possible she had taken her own life.

Kendrea's birth mom was said to have had drug addiction problems and failed to keep to an agreed protection plan which resulted in action taken by the child protection unit in 2013

The Star Tribune says it has seen records which suggest Kendrea had been assessed in June as having ‘homicidal and suicidal thoughts’ and had been receiving treatment

Records state that the child ‘showed severe guilt, as she does not feel lovable or acceptable and reports feeling guilty and responsible for out-of-home placement,’ the newspaper reports.

The records show that Kendrea was put in foster care in 2013 after a child protection unit accused her mother of drug abuse and failing to keep to an agreed protection plan, the Star Tribune report says.

The youngster’s behavior reportedly changed in care and one foster mother said the child had wanted to end her life by jumping out of a window and drew pictures at school of a child hanging from a rope.

According to the records, police also discovered healed ligature marks on the sides of her neck.

At first, Kendrea had suicidal thoughts every day of the week, but this had eased to five days a week in the run up to her death, according to the report.

However, the records also suggest that Kendrea was in a ‘good mood’ in the last few hours before the tragedy and had enjoyed a second helping of food at dinner before going to her room to watch television.

Her father informed police that everything seemed fine when he had looked in on the youngster at 8pm – but ten minutes later he found her hanged in the bedroom.

Officers, in an initial report of the incident, noted that the rope’s knot appeared too sophisticated for someone so young, the Star Tribune reports.

Kendrea’s grandmother Mary Lee Broadus, told the newspaper that she believed the youngster did not take her own life suggesting: ‘Somebody did it.’

Deputy Chief Mark Bruley from Brooklyn Park Police Department told the Star Tribune that ultimately investigators agreed with the medical examiner that such an act was ‘outside what a normal six-year-old could think about.’

‘We may never know if it was suicide or an accident,’ he added.
