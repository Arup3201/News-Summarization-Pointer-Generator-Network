Can talking birds speak languages other than English? The answer is a resounding 'yes', highlighted in this video where a Common Hill Myna is seen chatting in Japanese.

Called Abe Chan, the bird has become an internet sensation thanks to his grasp of the language, although whether it understands what it is saying remains to be seen.

The video was uploaded by Satoko Ohno in Japan.

In it, the bird can be seen responding to a phone call. Ohno then engages in conversation with the bird, showing off its surprisingly competent grasp of words and phases in Japanese.

Bird: 'Um hello, this is the Ono family.'

Bird: 'What's wrong?'

Owner: 'Abe-chan, you're a little too early. Once the phone's picked up, then properly say "hello".'

Bird: 'Okay, understood.'

Owner: 'Do you really understand? I'm counting on you. "Hello, this is the Ono family residence in Gifu."'

Bird: 'Okay, I understand!'

Owner: 'Got it.'

On his website, Ohno says that he has had a few mishaps with the bird in the past.

This includes Abe Chan jumping out of a window, leaving Ohno running around a residential area chanting his name.

This particular species of bird it known as the Common Hill Myna.

It is an animal of 'least concern' in terms of conservation according to the IUCN.

The bird is known for its distinctive jet-black feathers in contrast to its orange beak and yellow markings on its head.

They average about 12in (30 cm) in length.

Its most notorious trait, however, is its ability to mimic a wide variety of noises.

At dawn and dusk, when it is most vocal, it can be heard making a range of calls including whistles and screeches.

The bird can even, as shown in the video, mimic the human voice with surprising accuracy.

While it is unlikely they are aware what they are saying, the ability of the birds to clearly replicate a human voice is impressive, if slightly unnerving.

Nonetheless, seeing a bird speak Japanese is certainly a rare and fascinating sight.
