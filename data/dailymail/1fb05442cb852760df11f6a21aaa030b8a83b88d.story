A young British driver taking part in an elite car rally to Verbier has allegedly been caught doing 113mph in a 50mph zone on a Swiss road.

Former public schoolboy William Colebrook, 23, was stopped by police on the final leg of the tour to the upmarket ski resort from London.

He was behind the wheel of a black two-seater Audi R8 sports car - the same kind of car driven by Prince Harry - which has been impounded.

The car is capable of doing 0-62mph in 3.9 seconds and has a top speed of 196mph.

Colebrook, who is a student at Oxford Brookes University and a former pupil of Tonbridge School, Kent, was taking part in the 2012 DodgeBall Winter Rally, along with eight other drivers.

He is due to appear in court today.

Police spokesman Jean Marie Bornet said: 'The driver of an Audi was stopped on a three-lane section of road where overtaking is allowed within the 80km/h limit. He was stopped at 182km/h.

'His driving was not acceptable. Other people were put in danger. It was a busy day on the roads.

'The car was immediately impounded. His driving licence would have been taken if he was Swiss.'

He said the UK authorities will be made aware of the incident.

He
added: 'The case has been passed to the Ministere Public du Bas Valais 
in St Maurice. He will pay an initial fine guarantee while the case is 
being dealt with.

'The 
police have valued the car at 227,000chf (£157,000) without the 
modifications. This figure will be used by the judge when deciding the 
level of fine to impose.'

He said the process of returning the car could take years.

After being stopped by police, 
Colebrook joked on Twitter: ‘Being delivered to the #DodgeballRally 
finish line by police car is pretty badass. Having to fly home is 
not...’

The £5million 
convoy of supercars, including a McLaren MP4-12C, a Rolls Royce Phantom 
and a Ferrari 430 Spider, set off from the Mayfair Hotel in London on 
March 1.

The drivers in the invitation-only rally, which costs £2,250 per person, drove through France making stops in Paris and Burgundy before arriving in Verbier last Saturday, where the entrants then spent time on the slopes.

The first stop of the rally was the Pontoise private airport just outside Paris where the runway was closed for the day so the participants could test their hypercars to the limit.

Swiss police had been alerted about the rally and had set up multiple radars. Officers keep a close check on such rallies since they caught 20 motorcyclists in 2007 doing excessive speeds.

Entrants in last year’s DodgeBall Rally included a Sheik driving a gold Bugatti Veryron and another driver in a Lamborghini Perfomante.

Jonny Dodge, chief executive of GP Management, which organises the rally, said drivers are given a briefing by police before taking back and are told to ‘obey speed limits where they can’.
