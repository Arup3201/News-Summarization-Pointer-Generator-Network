Hand pressed to her mouth in horror, her face is a picture of fear and concern.

And little wonder – this is the moment Zara Phillips saw her jockey ex-boyfriend thrown from his horse at Cheltenham yesterday.

The queen’s granddaughter could only 
watch aghast from the royal box as Richard Johnson tumbled spectacularly
to the ground during his race. His horse crashed through the railings 
and into the crowd, drawing gasps from thousands of bystanders.

Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, was standing beside Zara and winced as the horse fell on to Johnson, crushing his left leg.

The injured jockey was lifted into an 
ambulance on a stretcher, in visible pain. He was taken for emergency 
treatment and ruled out of the rest of the day’s races.

Last night Johnson was said to be 
recovering well, having suffered only a soft tissue injury. ‘He had a 
lucky escape because it looked a terrible fall,’ a racing official said.

‘He is obviously shaken, but physically, he is in remarkably good shape.’

His horse, Wishful Thinking, was also said to be recovering.

Zara and Johnson had a tumultuous relationship which lasted more than five years. They eventually split in 2003.

Johnson, 34, had been riding in the 
Queen Mother Champion Chase – a race beloved by the Royals. Camilla 
backed the winner, Finian’s Rainbow, and was seen cheering in delight 
when her horse came in first.

Injured: A photographer was left with a facial injury following the fall

The Duchess of Cornwall was also a 
winner in the fashion stakes, leading the trend for faux fur on what was
an unusually chilly Ladies’ Day at the festival.

She wrapped up against the cold in a chocolate brown hat with a broad fur trim and a teal boucle coat with a velvet collar.

Zara, 30, wore a brown pillbox hat 
trimmed with feathers and a rose corsage. She was joined at the races by
her husband, rugby player Mike Tindall.

• The second day of the festival was 
again marred by tragedy. Abergavenny and Featherbed Lane were both put 
down after sustaining broken legs in the Coral Hurdle. Three horses died
on the opening day.
