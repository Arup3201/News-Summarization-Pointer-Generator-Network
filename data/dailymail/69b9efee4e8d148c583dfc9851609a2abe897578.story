Yet to do a Victoria Beckham circa 2006 and chop off all your hair? You're not alone.

Nearly half of all Brits never change their hairstyle, finding what they believe is their ideal 'do' and sticking with it, according to new figures.

The research also found that 47 per cent of Brits - like Cindy Crawford, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nicole Scherzinger - will go through their whole adult life with the same style or cut.

Among the other 53 per cent, an average adult changes their hairstyle once a year and nowhere more so than in Birmingham, where the typical person spends £32 a month at the hairdresser.

This compares to a UK average of £23.68 a month.

While nearly half of Brits never shake up their style, more than eight in ten women - and even half of men - are affected by so-called bad hair days, said the study.

Cheryl Cole and David Beckham were crowned as the King and Queen of hair types - after the nationwide survey revealed they’re the proud owners of the hair we’re all lusting after.

Cheryl, who beat everyone from Miley Cyrus and her pixie crop to Alexa Chung and her tousled bob, fought off tough competition from ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan and This Morning favourite Holly Willoughby, who came second and third in the poll; proving that long, loose feminine curls are in no danger of losing their most-wanted status.

As for the boys, David Beckham retains his crown as the UK’s favourite male fashionista with the majority of the vote, with One Direction’s Harry Styles and comedian Russell Brand winning the silver and bronze.

A spokesperson for Macmillan Cancer, who commissioned the survey to launch its 'Shave or Style' fundraising campaign, said: 'Changes to our appearance affect not just how we look, but also how we feel, suggesting that we should shake it up a bit more often in order to feel at our best.

'Shave or Style, a week of fundraising from 19th-25th July, calls on people to stand proudly alongside men and women facing cancer who are experiencing physical changes to their appearance such as hair loss.'
