Former rap music mogul Marion 'Suge' Knight's collapsed in a Los Angeles courtroom this afternoon after a judge ordered he be held on $25million bail in a murder case.

Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher said his client, who is diabetic and has a blood clot, told him that he hadn't received any medication since Thursday.

Fletcher said Knight, 49, hit his head on a chair when he fell after the bail hearing.

Bailiffs cleared the courtroom after Knight's medical episode and paramedics were seen going into the courtroom a few minutes later.

Fletcher said Knight was unconscious when the lawyer left the courtroom and an update on his condition was not immediately available.

Knight fell while deputies were bringing him back into the courtroom after Fletcher asked a judge to reconvene a hearing and issue an order that Knight be given his medication.

The attorney said Knight is being kept in solitary confinement without proper access to medication.

'He's being treated worse than Charles Manson,' Fletcher said.

A prosecutor said she believed the defendant staged the fainting spell 'in front of the cameras,' reported the Los Angeles Times.

Earlier this month, Knight was hospitalized after complaining during a court hearing that he was suffering from blindness. In all, he's been taken away from the courthouse by ambulance four times.

Since his arrest in late January, Knight has been complaining of his treatment in jail, claiming that he was being kept in solitary confinement, deprived of hot water and blankets, and seldom allowed to bathe.  

Talking to NBC Los Angeles, Matthew Fletcher said that moments before his client's collapse, Knight appeared ill and said he had not been given his medication.

'He was dripping sweat, like someone poured a bucket of water on him,' the lawyer said.

Knight stands accused of intentionally running down two men with a pickup truck at a Los Angeles area burger stand January 29 following an argument on the set of a commercial for the film Straight Outta Compton. 

Terry Carter, 55, was killed after being struck by a Ford F-150, while Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, survived his injuries. 

The 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row Records has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. 

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen set bail for Knight at a whopping $25million after Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes noted that Knight was on bail in a robbery case at the time of the hit-and-run crash. 

Knight's attorney argued that his bail should be set at $2million, telling the judge that had his name not been Suge Knight, prosecutors 'wouldn't have filed the case.' 

In seeking the multimillion-dollar bail, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed an extensive motion of 295 pages of legal papers and supporting material portraying Knight as a career criminal and repeated violator of probation and parole dating back to 1987.

The motion alleges that Knight is ‘physically incapable of stopping his violent criminal behavior’ and that since being released from prison in 2002 he ‘has continued his repugnant life of crime.’

Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) and Terry Carter (right) were the victims of the hit-and-run. Carter died of his injuries, while Sloan is recovering and allegedly told police that he 'f***** up' Knight before being run over

The documents also alleged that Knight is part of an ‘ongoing extortion scheme’ in which new rappers arriving in Los Angeles and Las Vegas are ‘required to pay a “tax"’ to Knight.

Knight has pleaded innocent and his lawyers have denied that he intentionally tried to kill Carter and Sloan. Matthew Fletcher also says Knight is blind in his left eye and may not have seen clearly during the incident.

Knight has previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and could face 25 years to life in prison under California's so-called three-strikes law if he is convicted at trial
