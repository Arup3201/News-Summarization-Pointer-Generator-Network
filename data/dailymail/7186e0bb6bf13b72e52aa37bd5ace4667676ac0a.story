A quarter of parents have at least one grown-up child living with them at home, a study reveals today.

The stark figure illustrates the impact of high property prices and the prohibitive fees and deposits demanded by landlords.

The average cost of homes in some parts of London is more than £1million while the cost of renting nationally has reached £740 a month.

The report, from the National Housing Federation, warns that ‘empty nest syndrome’ – the moment when parents are left alone in the family home – is 'becoming a thing of the past'.

Most of the parents said their offspring 'simply could not afford to move out'.

The Office for National Statistics says around three million adults between the ages of 20 and 34 do not have a place of their own – 20 per cent more than in 1997 when the UK house price boom began.

It said the increase was remarkable because the number of people in this age bracket has remained largely the same.

Men are more likely than women to live with their parents – 1.8million compared with 1.1 million.

David Orr, chief executive of the federation, said: ‘Empty nest syndrome is becoming a thing of  the past. Moving out and setting up a family home of your own is a normal rite of passage. Yet as rents, mortgages and deposits continue to soar out of reach, it is no longer an option for many.

‘We’re delaying adulthood for grown-up kids who are left stuck in their childhood bedrooms.’

The report, based on a poll of 1,176 parents with children aged 21 to 40, found that 27 per cent lived with their offspring.

And it said having an adult child at home could have an adverse effect on parents, with 23 per cent saying it has ‘caused them stress’, 18 per cent that it has triggered family arguments and eight per cent that it has caused them to fall into debt.

Craig Berry, 27, and his two grown-up sisters, still share a bedroom and live with their 60-year-old father in the family home in Bradford.

All three children have jobs and are desperately trying to save enough money to buy places of their own.

He said: ‘I get on well with my dad but I know he finds it stressful still having us living at home, especially when arguments kick off.

‘He raised us all on his own and I’m sure he imagined we’d all have left home by the time we were 18. I think he’d like to downsize if he could. He deserves the break.

The Government’s latest English Housing Survey highlighted how home ownership has dropped to its lowest level since the 1980s.

At its peak in 2003, 71 per cent of householders were ‘owner occupiers’. Today this is just 65.3 per cent.

Of the 14.4million homeowners in England, the largest number by a considerable margin are people aged 65 and over, equal to a record 30 per cent of the total.

There are 4.3million homeowners in this age group, which is more than a million higher than the total number for any other age group.
