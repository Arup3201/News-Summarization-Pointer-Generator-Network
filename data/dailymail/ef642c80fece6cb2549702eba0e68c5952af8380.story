Police in Vermont are desperate to speak to Robert Durst after he was linked to a teenage girl who went missing 44 years ago.

College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen standing at a bus stop opposite the store. 

Middlebury police chief Tom Hanley said at a press conference on Tuesday that Durst's name was first connected with the missing girl in 2012, following a tip from a member of the public about him owning the store but who was unaware of his link to Schulze.

Investigators searched Durst's former property in the area last year but found 'nothing of interest in this case', the chief told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.

On the day she vanished, Miss Schulze, who was a freshman at Middlebury College, was seen at 12.30pm across the street from Durst's store at a bus stop, eating prunes she had bought inside. 

She was trying to catch a bus to New York City on December 10, the case's lead detective Kristine Bowdish said on Tuesday, but it had already left.

The teen returned to her nearby college dorm room at 12.45pm and remained there for ten minutes.

At 1pm, her final exam began but she did not attend. At 2.15pm she was seen once again at the bus stop across from the health food store. She has not been seen since. 

Miss Schulze was last seen wearing blue jeans, a maroon sweater, parka and boots. She was 5'2', around 105lb and had severe acne at the time.

 All her possessions including her ID were left at her college room.

She was not reported missing until December 16 when her parents, who lived in Simsbury, Connecticut, contacted police. 

Fellow students had not noticed she was missing for several days in the ebb and flow of the end of term.

Her parents had asked that their daughter's disappearance be kept quiet for several weeks. It was finally made public on January 24, 1972.

Durst, who owned the Middlebury health store for two years and lived in the area with wife Kathleen, was not questioned in 1971, police said on Tuesday. The original investigator in the case has been dead for 20 years.

Police admitted there was no indication that Miss Schulze and Durst had ever met or interacted. 

However Chief Hanley said that Durst was 'a person who had a proximate connection with the missing person' and that they were cooperating with other agencies, including the FBI, for an opportunity to talk with the 71-year-old real estate scion.

'When it involves Robert Durst, it's a broad scope we have to deal with on this,' Hanley said.

He added that police had been 'following the news...and trying to get as many memories going as possible'.  

The student's disappearance was classed as an open missing person case and a possible homicide. Chief Hanley said there was 'assumed wrongdoing'.

The Schulze case had been reopened in 1992 after police received several leads but they came to nothing.

The missing college student was the latest suspicious case to be linked to Durst who has also been dogged by questions about his first wife's disappearance in New York

It was not until 2012 that a citizen called Middlebury police and told them Durst had owned the store.

Durst, is currently awaiting extradition to California to face a murder
charge for the 2000 execution-style killing of his friend Susan Berman, was denied bail on Monday in New Orleans.

Durst, who recently featured in the HBO documentary 'The Jinx', must remain in Louisiana on weapons charges until his next court date on April 2, a judge ruled, finding him a likely flight risk and a potential danger to others.

Middlebury police said the 2012 tip about Durst did not come from the producers of the HBO show.

Both of Lynne Schulze's parents had passed away without ever knowing what happened to their daughter.

Her brothers and sisters were 'very interested in the Robert Durst lead', police said. The family has also asked for privacy. 

Chief Hanley said: 'I've got an 18-year-old woman who disappeared, who didn't deserve to disappear. 

'We've kept this case alive for many years and will continue until we bring resolution to her family.'

Durst was being looked at in connection with five deaths or disappearances. 

Two women disappeared in California, his first wife vanished in New York, another woman went missing in Texas and now the latest, a teen college student in Vermont. 

Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail but argued
his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier
this month in New Orleans were improper, and that investigators
wrongly interviewed him without counsel present.

Durst's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to Los
Angeles County, where he has been charged with the 2000 murder
of longtime friend Susan Berman and could face the death
penalty.

The HBO documentary broadcast Durst being presented with
evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's
likely killer.

The 71-year-old Durst's voice was subsequently captured on a
microphone saying that he had 'killed them all.'

Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen
Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the
dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. 

The final HBO episode aired one day after Durst's arrest at
a New Orleans hotel, where he was staying under an alias and had
over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask
that could fit over his neck and head with salt and pepper hair, authorities have said.

FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the
country, the agency has said.

Durst, long estranged from his powerful family with its
major New York real estate holdings, appeared in court on Monday
with his head shaved, revealing a long scar on the right side of
his head.

He was being held in a prison psych ward in New Orleans where officials have deemed him a suicide risk.  

James O'Hern, an investigator for the local district
attorney's office, testified that authorities tracked Durst down
after he placed two calls from a phone at the hotel to the
voicemail on his personal phone.

Also in his room was a scribbled tracking number for a
package that authorities later seized, which contained $117,000,
O'Hern said.

Former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro,
who reopened an investigation in 2000 into the disappearance of
Durst's wife, was also in court.

Durst's attorney asked her to be removed from the courtroom
as a potential witness. Cantrell allowed Pirro, now a Fox News
host, to stay.
