Romelu Lukaku will play in Everton's FA Cup replay against West Ham in tribute to his boyhood friend Junior Malanda who was killed in a car crash in Germany on Saturday.

The Toffees forward has been left devastated by the death of the 20-year-old Wolfsburg midfielder and is being supported by Everton as he comes to terms with the tragedy.

Blues boss Roberto Martinez says Lukaku wants to play in Tuesday's third round fixture in honour of Malanda and told the Daily Mirror: 'We all knew that Rom had that relationship with Junior because it was a talking point when we played Wolfsburg in the Europa League, the two of them facing each other.

'We found out straight after the Man City game. It was such incredible news and it has been tough. Rom has been really affected. Everyone has to be honest, as we only played them not long ago.

'Playing football probably allows you to get rid of that feeling and that's exactly what he needs. He trained well on Sunday and we are all helping and supporting him.'

Malanda was on the verge of breaking into the Belgium national team and Martinez says compatriot Kevin Mirallas was also very close to the midfielder and added that Everton's Belgian duo are keen to play  to show their respect.

The winners of Tuesday's clash will face Bristol City or Doncaster in the fourth round.
