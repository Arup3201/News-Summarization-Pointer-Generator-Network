The murder trial of a jealous lover who killed nursing student Michelle Le begins on Monday, authorities have said.

Giselle Esteban, 28, is charged with murdering Miss Le because she blamed her for destroying a relationship with her ex-boyfriend and father of her child.

Miss Le was reported missing in May 2011 after she failed to return from a break during her shift at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Hayward, California.

On trial: Giselle Esteban, 28, is facing murder charges over the death of nursing student Michelle Le in California last year

After a four-month intensive search operation, the San Francisco student was found in a makeshift grave in a canyon.

Le's decomposing body was found in remote wasteland on September 17, 2011.

Esteban, 28, who knew Miss Le from high school, was charged with Miss Le's murder on September 8, 2011 based on DNA evidence and the discovery of threatening text messages.

Esteban’s texts all stemmed from jealousy that Miss Le was having an affair with her ex-boyfriend, the prosecution said.

Scott Marasigan, who has a child with Esteban, continually denied any affair with Miss Le, but Esteban never believed him. He said Esteban became ‘so enraged that she began essentially to hunt down Michelle'.

The 28-year-old has been brought to trial quickly as the prosecution skipped the preliminary hearing and presented their evidence to a criminal grand jury last December who indicted Esteban on a murder charge.

Marasigan is believed to have dated Esteban, having a daughter with the woman in 2005, before they broke up. He was given full custody of their daughter in 2010.

He then went on to date Miss Le although they didn't have a sexual relationship.

However Esteban was furious that Marasigan and Miss Le continued to be friends, according to prosecutors.

It is alleged that she stalked Miss Le to her place of work then hunted her down to kill her.

Esteban sent messages to Marasigan, telling him that Miss Le ‘dug her own grave’ and ‘would not be around much longer'.

She reportedly followed Miss Le to 
the medical facility and attacked her in the parking lot before throwing
 her body in her car and dumping her in a valley.

It
 is unclear how the nursing student died but there was blood found in 
the back of Miss Le's own car which suggested that she was bleeding 
heavily.

Miss Le's white Honda SUV was later seen driving out of the garage by video surveillance later that evening.

The vehicle was found abandoned a few blocks away and it was unclear whether the student was driving it or not.

Police believe an assault happened at the hospital’s car park as CCTV shows Esteban at the scene before and after Miss Le’s disappearance. Detectives said they found traces of Miss Le’s blood inside her SUV, as well as on one of Esteban’s shoes during a search of Esteban’s home.

Marasigan described the mother of his child as manipulative and volatile, saying at times she had been institutionalized with manic depression and bipolar disorder.  Her behavior became so erratic in the days before Miss Le's death that Marasigan filed a restraining order.

Esteban had a second child last November but her ex-boyfriend said he is not the father.

The murder trial is expected to last one month.
