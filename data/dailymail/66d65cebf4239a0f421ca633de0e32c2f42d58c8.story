A Connecticut father-of-three has told a court the horrifying story of leaving his 15-month-old son on the backseat of the car for the whole day he was at work after forgetting to drop the little boy off at daycare in the morning.

According to police, Kyle Seitz, 36, drove his car three times with his toddler dead in the back seat after forgetting him when he went into work. 

He went to lunch and back, then drove to his son Benjamin's daycare eight hours after work before finally realizing the 15-month-old was dead in his Jeep, he told authorities. 

Seitz surrendered in his hometown of Ridgefield,  at 4pm on Tuesday after learning there was a warrant for his arrest over the tragic death of Benjamin in July.

In the 15-page arrest warrant presented to Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday, it was detailed how Seitz missed the turnoff to the daycare center where he should have dropped Benjamin after leaving home about 8.46am, and drove on to get coffee before reporting for work.

A software programmer, he left his job at lunch to get a sandwich and still did not noticing his son on the back seat of his Jeep Cherokee, according to The New York Times.

Tragic: It comes nearly three months after the state's medical examiner's office ruled that the incident was a homicide, saying Benjamin (left and right) died as a result of hyperthermia due to environmental exposure

Seitz finished his afternoon at work and drove to the daycare to pick up Benjamin at 5pm.

When staff at the center said Benjamin was not there, he 'walked out heading to his car in the parking lot and began walking faster', according to the arrest warrant.

He told the authorities that he 'felt shock and terror' when he discovered that his son was in the back seat 'motionless'.

Seitz has now been charged with criminally negligent homicide.

It comes nearly three months after the state's medical examiner's office ruled that the  incident was a homicide, saying Benjamin died as a result of hyperthermia due to environmental exposure.

However, at the time, authorities determined that further inquires needed to be carried out before any charges could be potentially filed. Officials issued an arrest warrant for Seitz only this week.

'He continues to have the support of his family and close friends,' the suspect's attorney John Gulash, said in a statement on Tuesday, according to the New York Daily News.

'It is a difficult time for everyone.'

Seitz, who has two daughters, aged eight and six, was supposed to take Benjamin to daycare on July 7, but forgot and instead went to work, police said.

He reportedly left his son alone inside his parked car for more than seven hours as temperatures climbed to the upper 80s. He only realized his mistake when he returned to his vehicle.

After discovering Benjamin lying unresponsive on the car's back seat, he apparently rushed the toddler to Danbury Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Just weeks after Benjamin's death, the child's mother, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz, said she forgave her husband of 12 years, describing the Owl Computing Technologies employee as an 'amazing father'.

'I love my husband,' she told the Associated Press at the time. 'Of course I forgive him. But it doesn't mean that our lives aren't different now.

'So we have to move forward with a new different reality for us, and it's always going to be that way.'

Expressing her grief: Mrs Rogers-Seitz has since set up a website, thegiftofben.com (pictured) , on which she writes about her feelings and daily life following Benjamin's death. Above, the website's homepage

Mrs Rogers-Seitz has since set up a website, thegiftofben.com, on which she writes about her feelings and daily life following Benjamin's death.

She has also become an advocate for technology that could help prevent people from accidentally leaving children in cars. 'If it can happen to us it can happen to anybody,' she said.

More than three dozen children die of hyperthermia - a very high body temperature - in cars annually in the United States. Since 1998, more than 600 children have died in hot cars.

Heatstroke can happen when the temperature is as low as 57 degrees, and car interiors can reach well over 110 degrees even when the outside temperature is in the 60s.

Innocent: Seitz, who has been charged with criminally negligent homicide, was released on a promise to appear in Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday. Above, his son is seen (left and right) before his death

Criminal charges were filed in about half the cases of child vehicular heat stroke deaths from 2004 to 2013, according to KidsAndCars.org, a nonprofit group that tracks child deaths and injuries in and around automobiles. 

The group said charges were filed in 177 cases, while in 160 cases there were no charges and in 34 cases it was unclear.

Of the cases involving charges, 96 cases led to convictions and 21 cases had no convictions. In 57 cases the outcome is unknown, the group said.

Of 220 cases in which a child was unknowingly left in a car, about half led to charges and at least 62 resulted in convictions, KidsAndCars.org said.

Seitz will appear at Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday, NBC Connecticut reported.

The charge against him is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison upon conviction.
