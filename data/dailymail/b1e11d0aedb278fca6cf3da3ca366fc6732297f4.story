Stabbed to death: Stephen Lawrence was killed in April 1993

Officers collecting evidence at the scene of Stephen Lawrence’s death had no written instructions on how to deal with exhibits and relied on their own awareness and experience, the Old Bailey heard today.

Items taken from Stephen after his death and then subsequently from different inquiry ‘scenes’ were stored in a disused cell at Eltham police station.

Exhibits officer DC Robert Crane, a serving officer since 1974, said there were no designated exhibit rooms within police stations at that time.

‘What were the anti-contamination procedures in a police station in 1993?’ asked Timothy Roberts QC, for Gary Dobson.

‘Gloves,’ said DC Crane. ‘There were, if you were in a contained crime scene, you would have over shoes available.

‘But you didn’t have the white suits at that time unless you had a specific examination by a scientist who had come out of a laboratory.’

He told the court police officers worked on ‘awareness’.

Asked if there was an ‘exhibit handling manual’, he said: ‘I don’t think there was one.’ Mr Roberts asked: ‘Nothing written down on how to deal with exhibits?’ ‘No,’ said DC Crane.

‘No signs in the exhibit room saying “make sure everything is sealed”,’ said the barrister.

‘We didn’t have identified exhibit rooms,’ the officer replied.

Despite the lack of specific instructions, he added: ‘Everyone had awareness of cross-contamination.’ He said it was the exhibit officer’s duty to check areas where exhibits were removed from their sealed brown paper bags and photographed.

‘Were any steps taken not to get fibres or flakes on your own clothing when handling exhibits,’ asked Mr Roberts.

‘Not at that time, no,’ said DC Crane.

The barrister added: ‘What 
anti-contamination procedures were in place to ensure that, as officers 
wrapped packages with tape did not pick up other contaminants from the 
surface, perhaps where things were photographed or from their own 
clothing.

‘Were there any specific instructions issued?’

‘Not that I am aware of,’ replied DC Crane.
He told the court the ‘significance’ of this as a source of contamination had not been fully appreciated at the time.

‘If it was microscopic you wouldn’t know it was there,’ he said.

He said police used ‘common sense’ when dealing with exhibits.

DC Crane told jurors he used a disused cell at Eltham for the Lawrence case.

He said: ‘I had Lawrence exhibits on 
one side of the cell. I just marginalised areas within the cell.’

DC Cooke, pictured leaving the Old Bailey today, described Dobson as 'nervous' as he spoke to him on the doorstep of his family home three days after the killing

Alison
Morgan, junior prosecutor, asked: ‘Different scenes were getting 
different areas?’ ‘Yes,’ said the officer.

DC Stephen Pye told the court he had seized Stephen’s clothing in two hospital sacks at 3am on April 24 and wore rubber gloves.

He said the police exhibit bags he 
placed the items in were not sealed because the clothing was 
bloodstained and they were still wet.

Earlier Gary Dobson, who is suspected
of taking part in the killing looked ‘nervous’ as he denied taking part
in the fatal attack, the jury heard.

Dobson, then aged 17, spoke to a police officer on the doorstep of his family home three days after Stephen’s death.

The teenager, who was studying at an 
IT college in Covent Garden, told DC Graham Cooke he had been at home 
studying with his parents on the night of the stabbing.

Described as spotty and clean-shaven 
with dark brown hair cut over his ears, Dobson was questioned in the 
presence of his father for about five minutes, jurors were told.

DC Cooke, now retired, called at the 
Dobson family home in Eltham, around 6pm on April 25 during a round of 
house to house inquiries.

He said Dobson was 5ft 9in tall, and of slim to medium build.

‘I asked him where he was on the 
night of April 22, 1993 and was he at the scene of the Stephen Lawrence 
murder in Well Hall Road at 10.30pm,’ said DC Cooke.

‘He said “no” he was at home all night.’

Dobson said he had been studying, 
having returned from college shortly after 5.30pm and his mother and 
father had been in at the time.

‘He stated he didn’t know the victim and he had heard about the incident in the papers,’ said DC Cooke.

Dobson told the officer he had last been in Well Hall Road, Eltham, at 5.30pm on April 22.

Asked by prosecutor Mark Ellison QC 
if he had made any further observations, DC Cooke said: ‘In my opinion 
he was nervous at the time.’

Dobson had answered the door in a green shirt and army-style trousers, it was said.

Some 20 minutes later DC Cooke saw Dobson walking in nearby Appleton Road with his girlfriend, this time wearing blue jeans.

They were seen to enter the home of his friends Jamie and Neil Acourt, where they stayed for five minutes.

Dobson was then observed walking in to a nearby McDonald’s.

The court has heard Dobson later 
changed his story about his whereabouts on the evening of Stephen’s 
murder and told police he had left home at 11.45pm to visit the Acourts 
to collect a CD and returned home about 30 minutes later.

Stephen, 18, was stabbed to death by a
group of white youths who attacked him and friend Duwayne Brooks as 
they waited for a bus in Well Hall Road at 10.30pm.

Tragic scene: The spot in Well Hall Road, Eltham, where Stephen lay dying

Dobson, now 36, and David Norris, 35,
are now on trial accused of being part of that group which forced the 
A-level student to the ground and stabbed him twice.

Both men were charged after a 
forensic breakthrough in 2008 when scientists launched a cold case 
review of exhibits seized when the pair were arrested during the 
original investigation in 1993, the jury heard.

A speck of Stephen’s blood was found 
on Dobson’s grey jacket and scientists also found 16 fibres from the 
clothes Stephen was wearing on Dobson’s clothing or in the evidence bag 
it was kept in, it is said.

It is also claimed that a bag used to
store a pair of jeans from Norris contained two of Stephen’s hairs, 
while fibres which could have come from the victim’s trousers and polo 
shirt were found on a sweatshirt that was seized.

Defence lawyers claim neither man was
at the scene at the time of the killing and will argue that forensic 
evidence has been contaminated during the course of the investigation.

At the time of the murder Norris lived in Chislehurst, while Dobson lived in Eltham. Dobson and Norris both deny murder.

The trial continues.

Paul Peters is accused of smashing a bottle on the memorial plaque, which is in Well Hall Road, where Stephen was fatally stabbed

A man accused of smashing a glass bottle on the Stephen Lawrence memorial has denied it was a racist act of vandalism.

Paul Peters, 33, is accused of smashing a bottle on the memorial plaque, which is in the road where the teen was fatally stabbed, in October.

But Peters, of Kidbrooke, claims he dropped the bottle while having a drunken argument with his girlfriend. 

Appearing at Bexley Magistrates Court Today, Peters’ defence team indicated that he would plead not guilty to charges of racially aggravated criminal damage and criminal damage when the case goes up for trial. 

Michael Freeman, defending, claimed that Peters, who was arguing with his girlfriend at the time, dropped the bottle without realising he was in the vicinity of the plaque. 

He said: 'He was walking home drunkenly carrying a bottle in his hands. Neither of the witnesses said there was anything deliberate or reckless in the dropping of the bottle. 

'Both witnesses describe him as drunk. There’s no suggestion for that part that he did anything intentional.'

He added: 'He was having an argument with his girlfriend. They had to get off the bus as she was feeling unwell. They got off before their due stop. 

'They began bickering and he dropped the bottle in a drunken state at that particular unfortunate point.'

He also questioned whether the bottle had been dropped on the plaque itself, saying: 'It was dropped on the pavement. 

'There’s no evidence that the bottle went on the memorial.'

Asked whether the plaque had been damaged by the bottle, Mr Freeman said: 'I think that will only be whether there was any discolouration from what was in the bottle.' 

Adjourning the case until December 19, District Judge Roger Ede said: 'The allegation is that he was walking past the Stephen Lawrence memorial plaque, dropped a glass bottle and glass shattered all over the pathway. 

'I am going to adjourn this case until December 19 when the trial will take place.'
