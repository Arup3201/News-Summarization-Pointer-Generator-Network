For anyone who’s ever hankered after making others laugh for a living, now could be the time to pick up your pen and get drawing.

Each year the British Cartoonists’ Association’s Young Cartoonists of the Year competition attracts thousands of entries – and gives budding cartoonists the chance to have their work judged by the best in the business.

The panel this year includes the cartoonists from nearly every national daily newspaper, including the Daily Mail’s incomparable Mac.

Another judge is Oliver Preston, chairman of the Cartoon Museum in London, whose work has appeared in publications ranging from The Field to The Spectator.

Entries can be on any subject, and be anything from a political cartoon to a strip cartoon or a simple joke

He said: ‘There’s no set path to becoming a cartoonist.

‘If you want to become a plumber or an electrician, you go on a course. If you want to become a cartoonist you just have to keep sending your material in to magazines.

‘It’s a very, very difficult profession to get into and make a living from unless you’re at the very top of your game, but some of our past winners have gone on to become professional cartoonists.

‘So many people from all different backgrounds will know someone who loves drawing cartoons, and we want to encourage them all to enter.’

Entries can be on any subject, and be anything from a political cartoon to a strip cartoon or a simple joke.

The winners are invited to the Cartoon Art Trust annual fundraising and awards ceremony where they have the chance to rub shoulders with the great and good of the cartoon art world.

Cartoonists’ association chairman Martin Rowson said: ‘As judges, sometimes we’re more impressed by a good gag, sometimes by the quality of the drawing. It’s an artless art and what we’re looking for is that special cartoony quality.

One of Mac's recent cartoons pokes fun at a comment made by David Cameron last week

‘I always have a joke with the winners that the real reason we have the competition is so we can isolate the good ones, break their fingers and make sure they’re not a threat to us.’

There are two age groups – under 18 and under 30. The winner of each category receives a £250 prize and a certificate – which is traditionally drawn on and signed by the judges.

Entrants are asked to submit one original cartoon, in colour or black and white, drawn freehand to a maximum size of A4.

Entries must be submitted by November 10 to The Young Cartoonists of the Year Competition, The Cartoon Museum, 35 Little Russell Street, London, WC1A 2HH.

The organisers regret they cannot return entrants’ artwork.

Details can also be found at www.cartoonmuseum.org under the ‘get involved’ tab.
