Two officers at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen shot and killed a pair of armed Yemeni civilians during an attempted abduction of the Americans at a Sanaa business last month, the State Department said Friday.

The officers have left Yemen, Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a statement. No other details were provided.

Citing unidentified U.S. officials, The New York Times reported that the Americans were a CIA officer and a lieutenant colonel with the elite Joint Special Operations Command who were visiting a barber shop in an upscale district in Yemen's capital.

Within days of the shooting both 
Americans left Yemen with the approval of the Yemeni government, the 
newspaper reported. It said the shooting occurred on April 24.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa closed temporarily because of attacks on Westerners.

A
 day before Tuesday's closure, gunmen opened fire on three French 
security guards working with the European Union mission in the Yemeni 
capital, killing one and wounding another.

The U.S. has waged a heavy campaign of drone strikes in Yemen against the group al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.

This
 month the Yemeni government has been waging an offensive against the 
militant group, and violence around the country has been on an upswing.

Tension: An armored vehicle is parked in front of the Special Security Forces building in Sanaa May 10, 2014. Suspected al Qaeda-linked gunmen attacked Yemen's presidential palace on Friday and tried to kill the Defense Minister in his car, in apparent reprisal for the army's biggest push against militants in nearly two years

On Friday, gunmen believed to be al-Qaida militants ambushed the motorcade of Yemen's defense minister in the Mahfad region, officials said. The assassination attempt failed.

Later in the day, a security checkpoint near the presidential palace in Sanaa came under attack and at least two policemen died.

A night earlier in Sanaa, two al-Qaida militants from Marib province were killed in clashes with security men, the Interior Ministry said.
