The British director of a new action movie that was released this week has denied that a scene in which a U.S. president gets his head blown off is meant to depict President Barack Obama. 

Matthew Vaughn said Kingsman: The Secret Service is not an attack on Obama and that the U.S. commander-in-chief character is only meant to be 'reminiscent' of him.   

The film, which stars Colin Firth as a British secret agent attempting to save the world from a billionaire bad guy played by Samuel L Jackson, made headlines as a number of critics pointed wondered if it was the first major studio movie to kill a sitting U.S President.

Kingsman:The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid, played by Taron Egerton, who is recruited by Colin Firth's secret agent character

Kingsman, which is based upon an acclaimed comic book, doesn't refer to President Obama by name but the inference is clear.

In one scene Jackson's character Valentine is seen pitching his evil plan at the White House and he shakes hands with a man who - although he only see him from behind - bears a striking resemblance to the current president. 

Vaughn said in a recent interview that he only used an actor who looked similar to Obama to illustrate for viewers how powerful Samuel L. Jackson's character was in the film, he told Entertainment Weekly. 

'The easiest way to making the point where people knew that Valentine was in power was to have the White House,' Vaughn said. 

'We needed someone who was reminiscent of Obama, so that people got the point.'

He also pointed out that the film's ending was an attack not just on the U.S. president but on 'all politicians'. 

Vaughn had previously called the controversial character 'Obama-ish'.  

'The White House and Obama-ish president — there's no other symbol about a global power than the White House,' he told IGN.

'If I used 10 Downing Street, most people would go, "What's that little black door? Where is that? Who is that?" So I needed to show that Valentine was — when you hear Valentine saying, "Politicians are s***," you pull back and go, "Oh, f***! He's in the White House! This guy's powerful.'''

Director Matthew Vaughn has denied that the final scene, which features a U.S. president bearing a striking resemblance to the current commander-in-chief, is meant to be Obama 

Vaughn said he only used an actor who looked similar to Obama to illustrate for viewers how powerful Samuel L. Jackson's character was in the film 

Star Colin Firth likewise would not confirm if the character was meant to be President Obama and believed the movie was 'going more for the mischievous hint that it’s him,' he said in an interview with Vulture. 

Whatever the theories, Vaughn believes the movie would make Obama laugh if he decides to watch it. 

'I know he’s a big comic book fan, so I think he’ll go with it,' he said. 

'I think Obama is a good man. This whole movie is meant to be fun.' 

Kingsman tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius who decides to start a mass genocide in order to save humankind from going extinct. 

Jackson's character achieves this by turning people into homicidal killers using subconscious signals sent out by his tech company. 

Meanwhile the world's most powerful people, from politicians to royalty to celebrities, are protected with a neck implant that keeps them safe from getting turned - but also blocks them from trying to exert their own control over the situation. 

If they try to save the world, they lose their head. 

But the controversial scene comes not from a heroic attempt at rescue but rather from a sinister plan by the recruited street kid - who decides to activate all the implants. 

Kingsman has drawn comparisons to The Interview, which featured North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un being assassinated. 

It also stars Mark Strong, Taron Egerton and Michael Caine.
