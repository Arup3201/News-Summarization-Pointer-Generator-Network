President Barack Obama read 'Mean Tweets' on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live last night, but he was unfazed.

After enduring the routine — in which celebrities read hostile Twitter comments about themselves — Obama told Kimmel: 'You should see what the Senate says about me.'

The president also joked about the perks and restrictions he faces, revealing that he's not allowed to use cellphones that have recorders in them. (Hence his ever-present BlackBerry.)

He also noted he can visit the dentist in the White House basement, but doesn't text and can't drive.

Big time: The president swung by Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday and even read mean tweets about himself in a segment that most often features actors and other celebrities

Thanks Obama: The mean tweets were mostly lighthearted but the president had the opportunity to poke fun at himself several times when his interview with Kimmel began

Kimmel asked if that was because you need a birth certificate to get a driver's license.

Obama — whom Kimmel introduced as the 'first Kenyan-born Muslim Socialist ever elected president' — deadpanned that Kenyans 'drive on the other side' of the road.

With Sean Penn waiting in the wings, Obama said he was quite familiar with the actor's 1982 coming-of-age comedy 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'

'I lived it,' Obama said. 'I didn't just see it.'

The President even read mean tweets about himself in a segment that usually features actors and other celebrities. 

One included the rather harsh joke: 'How do you make Obama's eyes light up? Shine a flashlight in his ears.'

Another tweeted: 'Somebody send Obama some lifehacks on how to be a good president. Ha ha. Like, I bet that would help. Lol.' 

One member of the public also quipped: 'Is there any way we could fly Obama to some golf course halfway around the world and just leave him there?'  

President Obama declined to comment on his late night talk show appearance, despite much prodding by Jimmy Kimmel, about whether he immediately went to find out the truth about Area 51 after being sworn in as president.

However, he did drop some interesting reveals on the audience about the strange things he cannot do as President of the United States, as well as one thing he can do (but doesn't).

Obama revealed that he is not, for security reasons, allowed to drive a car as president.

'I can't drive,' he blurted, before realizing it sounded as if he wasn't able to drive at all.

Kimmel quipped: 'Is that because you don't have a birth certificate?'

'In Kenya, we drive on the other side of the road,' the president joked back.

Obama also revealed that he's not allowed to use a cell phone that has a recording device, which means he's banned from using many smartphones and must stick to the less high tech Blackberry.

Among other restrictions, the president also doesn't get to head to the dentist when he needs a cleaning. Instead, he revealed, the dentist comes to him and does all the necessary work in the White House basement.

One thing Obama does get to do in his massive Washington residence is raid the White House kitchen whenever he wants, he revealed. 

Though when asked by Kimmel if he can run down to the fridge n his underwear when he's hungry at night, Obama demurred:

'I could, but I don't,' he said.

Got heavy: The Mean Tweets segment was the start of what was mostly a fun appearance on Kimmel, though the president did discuss recent events in Ferguson, Missouri

Kimmel spared the president from questions about the latest controversy involving the Secret Service — although Kimmel's security guard and sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, dressed in a full Secret Service getup of dark suit and sunglasses. 

The glasses, Kimmel joked, were simply hiding a hangover: 'Secret cerveza.'

Obama's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live fulfilled a commitment the White House made after he had to postpone an appearance last year.

Kimmel, at one point, asked Obama if he has 'Hillary Clinton's new email?'

'I can't share it with you,' the president quipped, 'I don't think she'd want you to have it.'

During a more subdued segment, Obama reflected on Wednesday night's shooting of two police officers in racially tense Ferguson, Missouri, just days after he had delivered a speech on racial healing in Selma, Alabama.

'What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest, but there was no excuse for criminal acts,' he said.

President Barack Obama was given the full military protection with three US Military V-22 Osprey worth $68 million each flying next to him in Marine One on his way to be interviewed on Jimmy Kimmel Live

'Whoever fired those shots should not detract from the issue — they are criminals, they need to be arrested. 

And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides — law enforcement, who have a terrifically tough job, and people who understandably don't want to be stopped and harassed just because of their race — that they are able to work together to come up with some good answers.'

After the 'Kimmel' taping, Obama attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the Santa Monica home of Chris Silbermann, president of ICM Partners, one of the top talent agencies in Hollywood. 

The event was closed to the press, but a Democratic official said the event attracted about 25 people who each paid up to $33,400.

Obama is flying to Phoenix today to hold a roundtable event on veterans' health care.
