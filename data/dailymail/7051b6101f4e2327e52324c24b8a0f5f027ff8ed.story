A four-year-old girl and her grandmother had guns held to their heads by masked robbers who ransacked their home for just £100.

One of the thugs pointed a gun at the 
granddaughter's head and threatened to pull the trigger, while another held a firearm and knife to Rosemary Campbell's throat.

The woman immediately handed over two 
mobiles phones and around £100. The gang of five then ransacked the
first-floor flat in Brockley, south east London before fleeing.

Terrifying: A gang of armed robbers held guns to the heads of a four-year girl and her grandmother after raiding a flat in this street in Brockley, south east London

A relative, who did not wish to be named, said: 'They broke down the door and came up the stairs and put a knife to Rosemary's throat and a gun to her head.

'They also put a gun to the child's head, threatening to kill her.

'We are sick to the stomach. We can't process it. We can't get it through our heads how anybody could do this. We have no idea why they would want to do it.

'They even said they would come back to get them if they called the police. They are completely traumatised.'

It is understood that both victims were treated in hospital for shock after the raid, but are unharmed.

Ms Campbell was so overcome by the ordeal that she has now moved out of the flat. She refuses to return there.

Ms Campbell, 47, was there caring for the little girl while her mother went out shopping.

The break-in took place while the child's mother was out shopping for food.

'Raid left both victims traumatised': Detectives from the Serious Acquisitive Crime team at Lewisham Police (above) are appealing for witnesses

One neighbour has told police that two men called at her home in the street just 90 minutes earlier.

The two men, described as black and wearing dark hoodies, asked: 'Does Gerald live here?'

The
neighbour thought it an odd incident. It is thought they may have been 
members of the gang, checking addresses in the street.

Detective Inspector Ian Cameron, from the Serious Acquisitive Crime team at Lewisham Police, appealed for witnesses to the break-in at around 3pm on Monday of this week to come forward.

He said: 'This was a terrifying attack which occurred in the middle of the day and left both victims traumatised.'

He said they were looking for five black men who were wearing balaclavas, gloves and dark clothing. One was in a green camouflage jacket.

He added: 'I am convinced that someone in the local area has seen or heard something that could assist us with our investigation.

'I would encourage anyone who has information to speak to our incident room as soon as possible.'
