As far as glamour goes, the Vienna Opera Ball is up there with the BAFTAs and The Met Ball.  

The ball is one of the most exclusive events in the Viennese social calendar and every year, Austria's most important men and women descend on the Wiener Staatsoper in Vienna, to rub shoulders with stars like Kim Kardashian and Hilary Swank.

To kick-start the festivities, 186 debutantes and their partners dance the opening waltz, under the watchful gaze of the older guests.

The 18-24 year olds spend weeks rehearsing for the dance, which lasts just four minutes. 

But while the moment is fleeting, it is also hugely popular - hundreds of thousands of people tune in to watch the dance played out from living rooms across the globe. 

Dressed in the traditional white debutante gowns, with diamante tiaras and long-sleeved white gloves, the image of the young women is a throwback to early 20th century Europe. 

Taking part is still seen as a rite of passage for some young Austrian women - it is their introduction into society.

In the UK, these traditions have been almost entirely forgotten, but Vienna's long history with balls means that it still a large part of becoming an adult in Austria. 

Although the Opera Ball is the best known, with tickets starting at £220 and a box as much as £16,300, the city hosts more than 450 of them every year.

They include the Pharmacists’ ball, Lawyers’ ball, Coffeemakers ball - and even a weightlifters’ ball.

While the women are required to wear a long white dress, they all have different embellishments, like corset-style lacing and sequinned-edging
