Former Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret (pictured) raped a 15-year-old girl together with Jimmy Savile, a court has hear

Jimmy Savile raped a 15-year-old girl with another DJ who told her afterwards, ‘You should be thanking us’, a court heard yesterday.

The alleged victim said she was taken to a flat by former Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret and ‘couldn’t believe it’ when she saw Savile was there.

But the starstruck girl’s delight at meeting her hero turned to horror when Savile raped her, allegedly followed by Teret.

Afterwards, Teret – known as Ugly Ray – is said to have told her that she should thank them for having taken her virginity.

Teret, now 73, went on trial yesterday along with two other men for an alleged series of rapes and sexual offences involving 17 women over around 35 years.

After Savile died in October 2011, he was found to have raped hundreds of boys and girls over several decades. Publicity surrounding the subsequent inquiry led to Teret’s alleged victims coming forward.

He had already appeared in court in October 2013 charged with historical sex offences when the girl, now in her 60s, saw him on the television news. 

She had kept the alleged rape a secret from all except one person, but went to police after becoming enraged at the sight of him waving and smiling.

Prosecutor Tim Evans told Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester that in his Sixties heyday, Teret was treated as royalty by schoolgirls at youth discos and clubs in Manchester where he DJed with Savile. 

Among them was the 15-year-old at an alcohol-free youth disco in 1963 or 1964 at Salford’s Higher Broughton Assembly Rooms.

The youngster and her friend were wearing trendy Mary Quant dresses thanks to a relative in the fashion trade. While her friend was dancing, Teret – then in his early 20s, although he said he was 17 – sat beside her and took a cigarette out of his sock. Mr Evans said the girl, who had just left school, ‘thought that was cool’.

He took her out in his bubble car, saying he needed to deliver some ‘fancy boots’ to a flat. When they arrived she saw Savile – already a famous DJ – and ‘couldn’t wait to tell her friends’, Mr Evans said. 

The girl, who was small for her age, was offered a Lucozade and told to sit on the bed, jurors heard. Mr Evans said: ‘Savile came and sat down next to her, told her she had lovely hair and began to stroke it.’

He told the court that she was about to explain how she had straightened it using an iron and brown paper when Savile pounced.

The prosecutor said she later told police that he ‘put his hands up her skirt, pulled her knickers down and pushed her down on the bed’ as she cried: ‘What are you doing?’

The court heard he had met the girl in a club and then took her to a flat where Jimmy Savile was present

The court heard that one of the alleged rapes was committed between 1963 and 1964 'together with Jimmy Savile' (pictured)

The alleged victim said she was wondering: ‘Why isn’t Ray stopping this?’ But she said that once Savile had finished and taken a pair of black boots out of the box, Teret pushed her back on the bed and raped her as well before making her perform a sex act on him.

Then, in what Mr Evans said was the ‘callousness’ with which he treated his victims, Teret allegedly told her: ‘You should be thanking us because we have made it easier for the next person that goes there.’

She said Savile was taking a shower by then, so Teret gave her money for a bus home. But she threw it away, Mr Evans said, and went home where she only told her grandmother what had happened.

He said the rape was a ‘joint enterprise’ in which Teret ‘selects the girl and lies about his age to get her to leave with him’ before taking her to the flat and ‘giving her’ to Savile.

The court heard that Teret usually picked teenagers who looked young for their age and often brought them to flats for other men to abuse. 

One 14-year-old claims Teret kissed her while she was dancing at the Jimmy Savile Disc Club in Salford in 1962 before taking her to a bedsit and raping her.

On another occasion she, too, was taken to a flat to meet Savile, she told police, and was starstruck as ‘DJs were a big deal – were royalty’.

Teret’s alleged victims also included a 13-year-old who delivered newspapers in her school uniform. One day in 1967, he invited her in and raped her, the jury was told. After that, she visited often for sex, Mr Evans said, and was told to cough to ‘get rid of the little babies’.

Another who was 15 or 16 said Teret – who ‘copied Savile’s appearance and hung around Savile a lot’ – raped her after befriending her at a Manchester club called Beat City.

Mr Evans told jurors not to be blinded by Savile’s notoriety, saying: ‘This is not guilt by association.’

Teret, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, denies 34 sexual offences including 18 rapes between 1962 and 1996 or 1997.

William Harper, 66, of Stretford, Greater Manchester, denies the attempted rape of a girl under 16, while Alan Ledger, 63, of Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, two indecent assaults and one count of indecency with a child. The trial continues.
