A court has allowed a suspected cannibal accused of killing his wife and her two sisters and then eating their bodies to walk the streets. 

Convicted rapist Vasile Lavric, dubbed 'the Women Eater', argued it would ruin his car mechanic business if he were kept in jail ahead of his trial. 

And a court was forced to agree and release him because the bungled police investigation has already taken such a long time. 

Convicted rapist Vasile Lavric, dubbed 'the Women Eater' has been allowed to stay at home before his trial

The introduction of electronic tags in Russia means people awaiting trial can now argue they deserve the right to stay at home if their case has been dragging on.

But the country cannot afford the electronic tags and so police have no means to ensure Lavric keeps to his curfew. 

Instead police have to make occasional trips to his home in Radauti, a city in north-eastern Romania, to make sure he is in. 

The 60-year-old suspected cannibal was arrested in April over allegations he killed his 18-year-old wife, Nicoleta and her two sisters Iuliana and Ramona Lordache. 

Detectives investigating the case have confirmed that human bones had been discovered in his backyard, yet they have not managed to launch a case against him. 

They have even said there was evidence some of the remains had been cooked and eaten. 

A court was forced to release him because the bungled police investigation has already taken such a long time

Lavric married Nicoleta after his second wife died of a heart attack in 1993. 

Her parents allege that Lavric also had an affair with their youngest daughter, Iuliana, 18, who disappeared in 1995. 

The mother of the three girls, Cornelia, said: 'I saw her for the last time when she got into Vasile's van, and never saw her again after that.'

Despite their suspicions, nothing happened and they say police ignored their missing person report. Her body was never found, and Lavric remained with Nicoleta.

But in 1999, it was alleged he started an affair with his wife's other sister, 13-year-old Ramona. 

He impregnated her and she gave birth to a boy. 

He admits to the relationship but claims he was taken advantage of. 

He said: 'She was flirting with me. We had a party, we all drank vodka and beer, and when we ran out of booze my wife went to buy some more drinks. Then Ramona came to my room, took off my trousers and pushed me on the bed. I can't remember anything much after that. I was drunk.'

Then, in 2005, Nicoleta disappeared. The last time she was seen was by a witness who say her climbing into his car, according to the police reports quoted in local media.

When he was questioned about the disappearance, he said he last saw her when she moved out because she was jealous of his affair with her younger sister.

Ramona, now aged 19, moved to Lavric's house soon after. But she also went missing two months later.

Lavric was arrested in April after being accused of killing his wife and her sisters and then eating the bodies

But despite all the suspicious circumstances, the lack of a body meant the investigation over his involvement only started in April. 

A Romanian police insider said: 'We made a big mistake on this one, despite all the evidence it took far too long for it to be put together, and it was only when a special team was put together to investigate it that we had him.

'It's crazy that a man with this much evidence is allowed to be free but that's what happens when a case is not tackled for so long. To my mind the EU rules never considered electronic tagging in country's that did not have electronic tags.'
