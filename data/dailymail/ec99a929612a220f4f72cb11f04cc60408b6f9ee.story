Authorities say a 37-year-old man was drunk when he crashed his car into a Syracuse-area home, setting off a fire that destroyed the house.

The Onondaga County Sheriff's Office says Brian Aust of the town of Clay was driving on Route 31 around 1 a.m. Wednesday when he lost control of his car and hit a vehicle parked in a driveway in his hometown.

Deputies say his car then hit the house, striking a natural gas line and sparking a fire that spread to his vehicle and the home.

Bad day: Clay, New York resident Brian Aust was allegedly drunk Wednesday morning when he careened off the road after hitting a mailbox and then a parked car. He then smashed into a home, which ignited a gas line and set the home and the car on fire

According to Syracuse.com, Aust first over-corrected after smashing into a roadside mailbox.

His Hyundai Elantra then swerved to the opposite side of the road and collided with a parked car. 

The collision sent his car careening into the home and a gas light was ignited. The home, as well as Aust's Elantra, went up in flames.

The homeowner and another family member pulled Austin from his burning car before it became fully engulfed.

Deputies say the family has been left homeless. It was a 'complete loss' Onondaga County Detective Jon Seeber said. 

Aust suffered only minor injuries to his face. He was taken to a hospital by ambulance.

He's charged with driving while intoxicated, felony first-degree aggravated unlicensed operation, imprudent speed and failure to keep right. 

 It couldn't be determined if he has a lawyer.
