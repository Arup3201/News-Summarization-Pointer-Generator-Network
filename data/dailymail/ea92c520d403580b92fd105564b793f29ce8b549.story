A British mountaineer has reached the peak of Everest for a record-breaking eleventh time.

Kenton Cool scaled the mountain as part of a challenge to reach three summits in one continuous climb.

The 39-year-old, who lives in Quenington, Gloucestershire, is the first person ever to achieve the feat reaching the three peaks in three days.

Mr Cool: Kenton scaled Everest as part of a challenge to reach three summits in one continuous climb

The three peaks he scaled were Everest (8,848m), Nuptse (7,861m), and Lhotse (8,516m). 

All three form what is called the Western CWM - a wall of rock and ice that is part of the route to Everest.

An update yesterday on his Facebook page said he and climbing partner Dorje Gylgen were 'feeling strong'.

At noon he tweeted: 'KC Update: Lhotse has been summited. Descent hard. 3 summits in 3 days. Finishing line in sight.'

The climbs have been described as a fitting tribute to Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay who reached the 29,035-foot summit of Everest on May 29, 1953, becoming the first people to stand atop the world's highest mountain.

This week will mark the 60th anniversary of the ascent.

Mr Cool last year took one of the 1924 Olympic medals to the summit of Everest to fulfill a pledge by one of the Everest pioneers - 1922 expedition deputy leader, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Strutt.

He said: 'In 1894 Baron Pierre de Coubertin reconstituted the modern Olympic movement and made a deliberate choice to include our sport of climbing.

'He felt so strongly about climbing's inclusion that in 1924 he personally awarded the first ever Olympic gold medals for mountaineering, and in 2012 I fulfilled the subsequent promise made by Great Britain to Baron Pierre de Coubertin and the IOC to place one of the 1924 mountaineering Olympic gold medals on to the summit of the world's highest mountain 'for all humanity'.

'Climbing is the very essence of everything Baron Pierre de Coubertin meant when he wrote the Olympic motto of 'higher, faster, stronger', and it was there on the very first day of the modern Olympics.

'May 29, 2013 will be a momentous day for climbing. It is the 60th anniversary of the first successful summit of Mount Everest and it is the date the IFSC will present their case to the IOC. I'm backing the bid.'

Climbing in the Olympics would be different to scaling Everest - competition climbing takes place on man-made walls and the IFSC is proposing a multi-discipline 'triathlon' of speed, lead climbing and bouldering.

The bid is also being supported by Dame Kelly Holmes.

She said: 'The proposed triathlon format for Sport Climbing's bid for the 2020 Olympic Games sounds like a great concept.

'I know climbing is very popular with young people and the format fits perfectly with the Olympic motto of Faster, Higher and Stronger.

'I know the case for inclusion in the Olympic Games is becoming tougher all the time, it could go down to the wire when the final choice is made by the IOC in September. Hopefully the general public will see that Sport Climbing has a big future ahead.'
