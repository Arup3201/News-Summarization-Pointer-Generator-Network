All that sugar, all those E numbers... Easter is bound to be a somewhat hectic occasion whenever children are involved.

Family arguments are going to happen, and the first is usually at 1.30pm on Easter Sunday and involves someone getting upset about their chocolate eggs being either broken or stole, according to research.

Furthermore, what with all the arguing, cooking, cleaning and egg-hiding, mothers aren't spending as much quality time with their children as they would like, with most spending more than 13 hours during the Bank Holiday weekend simply preparing for the family get-together.

Easter arguments within families usually involve stolen eggs, and usually begin at 1.30pm on Sunday

Mothers spend over 13 hours cleaning, cooking and preparing for Easter

The average family do consists of nine people, and new research from Asda reveals mothers spend as many as three hours on 
Easter Sunday organising the day's activities - including Easter egg 
hunts and family games - as well as a further six in the two days before,
 preparing the house and buying Easter goodies.

Mothers will then spend a four 
hours in the kitchen on Sunday, preparing, cooking and cleaning up after Easter lunch.

The research also showed that the first family argument is likely 
to take place at 1.30pm, just as lunch is being served, with the 
most likely reason being stolen eggs between children. Other reasons 
likely for Easter arguments include too many vegetables piled on 
children’s plates, broken eggs and not enough chocolate.

Vickie Rogerson, from Asda says: 'For many of us Easter is the first 
family occasion since Christmas, and should be about a happy 
get-together rather than a hugely stressful time for mums.

'To avoid that
 argument at 1.30pm, mums should make more time for themselves - why not 
get the whole family to help out with chores and preparation by tempting
 them with some extra Easter treats!'
