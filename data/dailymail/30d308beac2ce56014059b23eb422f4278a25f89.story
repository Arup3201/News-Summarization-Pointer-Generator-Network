Wayne Rooney revealed his delight in the early hours on Tuesday morning after the arrival of his second child, Klay.

Wife Coleen was rushed into labour late on Saturday night, meaning Rooney had to miss champions Manchester United's final Premier League game of the season against West Bromwich Albion.

Rooney announced the news on Twitter, telling his legion of over six million followers: 'Our Beautiful Son Klay Anthony Rooney was born at 2.11am, Weighing 7Ib 11.1/2 oz. Both Klay and Coleen are fine..... We're all delighted!!'

Klay means 'he who is immortal' and with Rooney a huge boxing fan, the name could have been inspired by ring great Cassius Clay (now, of course, Muhammad Ali).

His message, posted at 3.49am, received widespread congratulations from his fans including celebrities Ed Sheeran and Apprentice star Lord Sugar, who were among the first to send their best wishes.

Coleen later tweeted: 'At 2.11am our Beautiful Son .... Klay Anthony Rooney entered the world. He weighed 7Ib 11.1/2 oz  We're all so happy and doing well. X'

Manchester United's official Twitter account posted: 'Great news overnight from the Rooney family. Congratulations to Wayne, Coleen and Kai on the birth of Klay Anthony from all at #MUFC.'

The 27-year-old is expected to have some downtime with his family, including three-year-old son Kai, before linking up with Roy Hodgson's England squad at the weekend ahead of next Wednesday's friendly at Wembley against the Republic of Ireland.

Despite ongoing issues at his club, with his future at Old Trafford seemingly uncertain having asked for a transfer, Rooney is in contention to captain his country.

After the Ireland match, Rooney is expected to travel with the Three Lions for the glamour friendly against Brazil on June 1 in Rio.

The striker is understood to be keen to start afresh under new Manchester United boss David Moyes, his former manager at Everton, and is seeking reassurance about his future.

The pair once fell out over false claims made in the player’s autobiography about Moyes leaking information to the press.

Since then, though, Moyes has spoken 
warmly of Rooney after he said the player phoned him to apologise 
personally and to thank his old boss for the guidance he gave early in 
his career.

Moyes is 
expected to meet Rooney, before taking a holiday at the end of this 
month, as one of the more pressing issues at the start of his Old 
Trafford reign.
