If you don't know what a word means, it's best to just not say it.

One Cleveland, Ohio news anchor learned that lesson the hard way when she 'accidentally' uttered a racial slur on-air Monday morning, during a chat about last night's Oscars.

WJW Channel 8 morning news anchor Kristi Capel was discussing Lady Gaga's tribute to the Sound of Music with her co-anchor Wayne Dawson when she used the word 'jigaboo' - a negative term referring to black people of a darker skin tone. 

Cringe-worthy: Cleveland, Ohio morning news anchor Kristi Capel used a racial slur on-air Monday morning but she says it was an accident 

Bad choice of words: Capel used the term 'jigaboo' which is a negative word referring to black people of a darker skin tone. Her co-anchor Wayne Dawson, who is African-American, appeared to know the meaning of the term by the look on his face

Whoops: Capel used the term in a misguided attempt to compliment pop-star Lady Gaga on her tribute to the Sound of Music at Sunday night's Oscars award ceremony

'It's hard to really hear her voice with all the jigaboo music whatever you want to call it...jigaboo,' Capel said in a misguided attempt to compliment the pop star. 

From the shocked look on African-American Dawson's face, he understands the term but doesn't draw attention to the gaffe as they turn the segment over to their traffic reporter. 

Capel went on to apologize for the statement to several viewers on Twitter, saying she didn't even know what the term meant. 

'I do apologize if I offended you, I didn't know the meaning behind it or that it was even a word. Thank you for watching,' she wrote. 

She later went on to Tweet a message to all of her followers. 

'I deeply regret my insensitive comment. I truly did not know the meaning of the word, and would never intentionally use such hurtful language. I sincerely apologize,' she wrote. 

Mea culpa: Capel later tweeted several apologies to individual viewers (above), before posting a general comment to all of her followers (below)

Keeping her job: WJW's news director Andy Fishman says the fact that Capel didn't know the word is 'no excuse' but that she will remain on the network 

Her news director Andy Fishman later apologized on behalf of the network in an interview with the Cleveland Plain-Dealer.  

'She didn't even know what the word meant, which is not an excuse,' Fisman said. 'We've spoken to her about this, and we're confident it won't happen again. From here, we'll handle it internally.'

Fishman says that Capel will not be terminated for the comment, and will appear on Tuesday morning's broadcast.  

'She does feel horrible about this. It's not who she is,' Fishman said.
