A Southwest airlines passenger boarded a plane only to receive an email telling him that his trip had been cancelled. 

Bob Woudstra paid $616 (around £410)  for  a round trip from Grand Rapids to Fort Myers, in Florida.

On the day of his flight, the Michigan businessman was dropped off at the airport, made it through security and successfully boarded the plane. 

A Michigan man was told his flight was cancelled two hours after take off as the airline had no record of him

But two hours into his flight, Mr Woudstra received an e-mail from the U.S carrier, notifying him of its no show policy.

The airline told him that he  wasn't on the plane, so they cancelled his flight Mr Woudstra said, explaining that he had to buy a new return ticket for $456 (around £304).

He told MailOnline Travel: ' I think Southwest needs to prove to me I wasn't on the plane, cause I have plenty of witnesses that dropped me off in Grand Rapids and picked me up at Ft. Myers.'  

After returning home, he called the airline to demand a refund, but was told he'd need to prove that he was onboard that flight. 

Southwest airlines say there could have been an error at the gate, which caused the misunderstanding

'I can't believe that with security supposing to be so tight that I could fly on a plane and Southwest doesn't even know I was on their plane.

'Southwest doesn't acknowledge that I was on the plane, they are just giving me, per Southwest "the benefit of the doubt".

'So that tells me they think I am lying, and Gary the guy I was traveling with must not have been there either, even though his ticket shows up. 

'For all the harassment that this has caused Southwest needs to step up.

'I think Southwest needs to prove to me I wasn't on the plane, because I have plenty of witnesses that dropped me off in Grand Rapids and picked me up at Fort Myers.'

Southwest Airlines is investigating the incident. A spokesperson said: 'Although we still haven't determined exactly where an error occurred, we will make an exception to the no show policy and refund the price of the second ticket.'

They went on to say that they are often contacted by passengers who have missed their flight and want a refund, but on this case the error may have been at the gate. 

Mr Woudstra is hoping for a full refund on both the tickets he bought.
