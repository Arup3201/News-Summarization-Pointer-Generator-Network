Target has been heavily criticized by customers after listing a black Barbie doll on its website for two times the price of the near-identical white alternative. 

According to Buzzfeed, the glaring error was first brought to the attention of the retailer - and the public - by Cincinnati resident Warren Johnson, who noticed the bizarre price discrepancy when he logged onto the Target website to buy a Christmas present for his daughter. 

After noticing the difference in cost between the Barbie Fashion Design Maker Doll, which was until recently priced at $23.49, and the Barbie Fashion Design Maker  African-American Doll, which was priced at $49.99, the outraged 30-year-old contacted the store to ask why there was such a difference in price between the two toys.

Spot the difference: Target had listed these two near-identical dolls for two very different prices, with the black version costing more than double the price of the white one

'It rubbed me the wrong way': Cincinnati resident Warren Johnson was furious when he saw the difference in price between the two dolls

The 30-year-old spoke to three different stores and while two told him the price difference was an error, a third admitted that the white doll was cheaper because it was more popular with customers. 

An official spokesperson from Target's corporate office was quick to reject this theory however, but admitted that she could not give any real reason as to what could possibly make one doll so much more expensive than the other. 

'[The Target saleswoman] was speechless and said she really didn’t have an explanation and she was apologetic, and she told us that a change would be made,' Mr Johnson told Buzzfeed. 'Then she gave us the doll for the price that the white doll was.'

He added to local Cincinnati news station WPCO: 'When my daughter asked the question "Why is the black doll more expensive than the white doll?" I really didn't have an answer. 

'It kind of rubbed me the wrong way.' 

Target later released a statement blaming the shocking price discrepancy on a 'system error'.

'It is never our intention to offend our guests with our product assortment,' the spokesperson said. 'Both dolls should have reflected the same pricing, however, due to a systems issue this change did not occur. 

Repeat offender: Amazon currently list the black version of the doll for $49.99, more than double the price of its white counterpart

Discriminatory pricing: Online retail giant Amazon has priced this white Barbie at $17.88, which is almost a third of the price of the black alternative

'We appreciate the guest bringing this discrepancy to our attention and have since adjusted the pricing and product detail listing. If you have any further questions about these items, please let us know.'

The retailer's explanation did little to placate its outraged customers, many of whom took to Twitter to voice their anger at the error.

Hundreds of people responded to Mr Johnson's original tweet, which featured a picture of the two dolls and their different price tags accompanied by the comment 'Whats wrong with this picture?' with many saying that Target should be made to undergo an official investigation.

'Target should be fined twice as much,' one user wrote, while another added: 'What is wrong with you, Target??'

Shockingly, Target is not the only retailer to have made the error; Amazon is currently listing the two dolls for two completely different prices, with the white toy listed for the bargain price of $17.88, while the black option is still on sale for the full price of $49.99.
