A man who formerly managed a walk-through zoo in northwestern Pennsylvania will spend 10 to 20 years in prison for having sex with a 14-year-old family friend at his house and the zoo, where the girl worked alongside his wife.

Bruce Sankey, 45, of Greene Township, was sentenced by a Mercer County judge on Wednesday. He had previously pleaded no contest to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.

Sankey apologized vaguely for 'anything involved on both sides,' which left Judge Robert Yeatts to admonish him, saying, 'You couldn't bring yourself to refer to the victim. You referred to the 'other side.'

Sick: Bruce Sankey, a former Pennsylvania zoo manager, has been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl during which he had sex with her at his workplace

'Unless you can show remorse and admit to what you've done,' Yeatts said, 'you will stay in the full 20 years.'

What's more--after reviewing letters written to the court describing Sankey's good character, reports the Sharon Herald--Yeatts told the court:

'I think there's a dark side to you that your family hasn't seen...I was concerned that in none of the letters did they express concern for the victim.'

Prosecutors say the incidents occurred in 2011, when Sankey worked at the Pymatuning Deer Park.

The girl hesitated to report the sex because she didn't want to harm Sankey's children and because of pressure from Sankey's wife.

Following Sankey's arrest, his wife was charged after prosecutors say she tried to cover his tracks.

In April 2014, Sankey's victim told a court that his wife Rachelle contacted her in an attempt to keep her silent about the months of abuse.

In tearful testimony, the girl revealed Rachelle tried blaming her in order to keep her quiet and even gave her Bible verses to shame her into silence.

Prosecutors offered Rachelle Sankey a chance to enter a diversionary program called Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition top avoid standing trial for witness tampering.

Her husband will be registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life.

Sankey once managed the Pymatuning Deer Park, where he worked with his wife Rachelle. She is awaiting her day in court on witness tampering charges after she allegedly tried shaming the teen into silence
