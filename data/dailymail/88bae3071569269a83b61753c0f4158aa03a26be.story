What some have called the worst video game ever made has fetched thousands of dollars for a New Mexico city.

An old 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' game cartridge drew the highest bid among 100 Atari games auctioned on eBay by Alamogordo officials.

The games were part of a cache of some 800 Atari video games buried more than 30 years ago in a landfill and dug up in April.

Dumpsite: In April, a cache of some 800 Atari video games buried more than 30 years ago in a landfill in Alamogordo, N.M. were uncovered, and now those games are being sold. So far, 100 of them have sold for a total of $37,000

Dig: After months of planning with state and local regulators, crews discovered numerous game cartridges on April 26. The dig cost more than $50,000

Found: City documents show that Atari consoles and more than 1,300 games were found, including 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.' Some of the other discovered titles include 'Centipedes,' 'Warlords' and 'Asteroids.'

Joe Lewandowski, a consultant for the film companies that documented the dig, says the online auction, which ended Thursday, generated $37,000.

'It's really gratifying to see that happening because again to everybody it was a bunch of garbage in the landfill. You're kind of nutty to go dig it up,' Lewandowski told KRQE-TV.

The 'E.T.' game, still in its original box, sold for $1,537 to a buyer in Canada. The interest in the games has gone global. According to Lewandowski, online bidders from other countries including Germany and Sweden snapped up items. 

Owns: Alamogordo owns the cartridges because they came from the city's landfill. The revenue will go to the city and the Tularosa Basin Historical Society

Documentary: LightBox Entertainment and Fuel Entertainment pursued the dig for a documentary that is due to come out Thursday

Highest Bid: An old 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' game cartridge drew the highest bid among 100 Atari games auctioned on eBay by Alamogordo officials

Earlier this month, a museum in Rome opened an exhibit on the dig that includes dirt from the landfill.

'I keep getting messages from people around the world asking me if there's any more left, it's crazy,' Lewandowski told the Alamogordo Daily News. 

'The people that lost the bids are demanding more but I keep telling them they have to keep checking.'

Reports that truckloads of the game were buried in the landfill have been urban legend since the early '80s. The 'E.T.' game's poor reception when it came out in 1982 was seen as a factor in Atari's demise.

City documents show that Atari consoles and more than 1,300 games were found, including 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.' Some of the other discovered titles include 'Centipedes,' ''Warlords' and 'Asteroids.'

Remaining: The city of Alamogordo still has about 700 of the Atari games left, the remaining cartridges will be sold on eBay over the next few weeks
