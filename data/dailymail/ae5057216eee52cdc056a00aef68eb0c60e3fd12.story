The sister of Ron Goldman, who was brutally murdered along with OJ Simpson's ex-wife, said today that she will never get over the loss of her brother, the pain of which still hits her daily.

The mother-of-one said that she will never be able to find closure after her brother was stabbed to death two decades ago. OJ Simpson was acquitted of his murder in 1995.

She told Today: 'My brother's gone, and every day I'm reminded of his loss, and I've worked really hard to find a good, healthy balance in my life... For as long as my brother's gone, the loss will be here, and there's no way to find closure in that.'

Ms Goldman also revealed how she 
repeatedly sent letters to Simpson in jail - where he is being held on 
separate kidnapping and armed robbery charges - in the hope of setting 
up a meeting with a man she only refers to as 'The Killer'.

She said: 'I needed to see him small. For so long, he had taken up so much space in my life and in my head. I needed to diminish him in size and see him in shackles and see him in an orange jumpsuit and have me be the one to finally walk away and let him watch me walk out the door.'

The 43-year-old appeared on the Today show on Friday to promote her new book, Can’t Forgive: My Twenty-Year Battle with O.J. Simpson.

She described the book as a way to reclaim her voice after so many years known as the sister of murder victim Ron Goldman.

She also made the shocking revelation that she almost killed OJ Simpson in revenge after seeing him by chance in a strip mall parking lot a year after he was found not guilty.

In an article published in the National Enquirer this week, she said: 'In 1996, (Simpson) walked in front of me while I was driving my car.

'I thought ''I can kill him, right here, right now.'' I never thought ''avenger'' and ''assassin'' were words to describe me, but in that moment they were.'

As she revved her car's engine and looked straight at Simpson, Ms Goldman's feelings of rage ebbed away.

She said: 'I am not a killer, and he is. I have appropriate hatred toward the man who stabbed my brother in the hear and left him for dead!'

Kim Goldman has released a book about her brother Ron's murder 20 years on

The 43-year-old mother-of-one, who 
lives in Valencia, Caifornia, is the director of the nonprofit SCV Youth
 Project, which provides counseling and support for young people.

Her e-book on the murder of her brother, Ronald was published on Tuesday and chronicles her decades-long legal pursuit of Simpson. 

In the book, Ms Goldman admits that she dreams about torturing Simpson.

Simpon's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, a waiter, were stabbed to death outside her Brentwood home on June 12, 1994.

In
 the days following the murders, the net began to close on Simpson, 
considered the prime suspect, after it emerged that his wife has 
suffered mental and physical abuse at his hands for years.

On June 17, the day that Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police on murder charges, the
 former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit 
in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California. Simpson finally surrendered to police and was jailed awaiting trial.

The internationally publicized trial of 
O.J. Simpson lasted one year and was dubbed the 'trial of the century'.

Ms Goldman writes in her memoir how she attended every day of Simpson's murder trial and the stress almost drove her to suicide.

She said that only the thought of her father Fred, struggling with the weight of his own grief, pulled her back from the brink.

In 1995, Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and Mr
 Goldman.

The 43-year-old said that watching Simpson go free left her feeling furious and betrayed.

Ms Goldman, who at the time was dating First Lady Hillary Clinton's make-up artist, said that her boyfriend conveyed messages of support from the White House.

She wrote in her book that Mrs Clinton passed messages of sympathy to her family and that when the Goldmans went to meet President Clinton, he said that was proud of how they had conducted themselves throughout the trial.

Following the criminal trial, the Goldman and Brown families pursued Simpson in civil court for $33.5million in damages and won.

The families have only see around 1 per cent of the money - but Ms Goldman says she will never stop trying to get the award from Simpson, not because they want to be rich but because she wants to leave him destitute.

In 2008, Simpson was found guilty of 
kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges in what he said was an 
attempt to retrieve memorabilia and personal items from two sports 
collectibles dealers in a casino hotel room.

Ms Goldman said that this news left her rejoicing that Simpson's bad karma had finally caught up with him.

Simpson

 was sentenced to between nine to 33 years in Nevada state prison. Ms 
Goldman sent him a card when he was jailed which read: 'Congratulations 
on your new home. Hope you enjoy your new digs! From the Goldman 
family.'

Simpson, now 
66, was granted parole on some convictions last July however he must 
serve 
at least four more years. His conviction came 13 years to the day after 
he was acquitted of his ex-wife and Mr Goldman's murders.

Ms Goldman, who only refers to Simpson as 'The Killer' in her writing, says that her only relief now will come from his death.

However she told SignalSCV that writing her book has brought with it a peace of sorts.

'Writing
 has been important to me in finding my voice and taking back control of
 my life,' she said. 'I wanted people to know the parts of me that are 
important and strong, rather than (the victim).'
