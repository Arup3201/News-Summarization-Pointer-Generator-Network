A private drone trying to record footage of a Northern California wildfire nearly hindered their air assault, fire officials said today.

State fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff says the drone was sighted above the fire burning in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of Sacramento on Sunday, the day after the fire broke out.

The person controlling the unmanned aircraft, whom she did not identify, was trying to get video of the blaze and was told to stop by authorities because of the potential danger to firefighting planes.

The fire — one of two that has forced evacuations in California — has burned through a little under six square miles and was 65 percent contained.

Some of the roughly 1,200 people under evacuation orders were allowed to return to their homes Monday morning.

Firefighters in Northern California had made progress on Sunday against the wildfire that destroyed 13 homes and forced hundreds of evacuations in the Sierra Nevada foothills, while a fire near Yosemite National Park destroyed one home grew significantly overnight.

The fire had burned over 2,500 acres (1,011 hectares) and was just 5% contained on Monday morning

Fire crews were able to significantly increase their containment lines but 'the steep, dry terrain continues to be a challenge,' a CalFire said.

About 1,900 firefighters, aided by aircraft including a DC-10 air tanker, were working to control the blaze.

CalFire officials say the fire started Friday when a vehicle drove over dry vegetation.

Alfred Shults, his wife, Carolyn, and their granddaughter fled their home in El Dorado County on Friday after receiving an automated telephone call ordering residents to evacuate, according to the Sacramento Bee.

Before he left, Shults said he packed as much as he could into his vehicle and turned on a sprinkler to soak the area around his beloved motorcycle.

'We just wanted to get out of there, and hope there's something left when we get back,' Alfred Shults, 65, told the Bee on Saturday as they waited for news at an evacuation center in Placerville.

Meanwhile, a wildfire that began Saturday west of Yosemite National Park quadrupled in size overnight to more than 3 square miles. It destroyed one home in the small community of Foresta, adjacent to the park, Ranger Scott Gediman said.

An estimated 100 homes in Foresta and the small community of Old El Portal were evacuated Saturday, and residents remained out of their homes Sunday. Two shelters opened for people and animals.

'There have been no injuries so far, which is wonderful,' Gediman said.

The 
nation's largest wildfire - the 618-square-mile Buzzard Complex in 
eastern Oregon, 45 miles northeast of Burns - remained at 95 percent 
contained on Sunday.

Incident reports from the fire say containment 
lines continue hold as crews monitor increased fire activity.

In
 north-central Washington, the nearly 400-square-mile Carlton Complex 
fire, the biggest in the state's history, continued to burn Sunday in 
rising temperatures, but no major flare-ups have been reported.

Sequoia trees and other wonders, remained open throughout Sunday. None of its treasures were threatened, Gediman said, although some areas were smoky.

About 400 firefighters, aided by fixed-wing helicopters, battled the flames, Gediman said. The cause wasn't immediately known.

Wildfires also burned in other Western states, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado.
