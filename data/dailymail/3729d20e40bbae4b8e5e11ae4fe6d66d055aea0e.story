A man has been arrested after an attempt was made to steal a statue of Eric Morecambe, the late comedian.

Police were called to Marine Road Central in Morecambe at about noon today following reports that the statue had been damaged.

Lancashire Constabulary said it is thought that someone attempted to cut through one of the legs of the statue.

The council has now removed the statue and the area has been fenced off.

The statue is a popular tourist attraction with many posing for photographs next to it in the Bring Me Sunshine pose.

Mark Cullinan, the chief executive of Lancaster City Council, told the Morecambe Visitor: 'When we got to the site it was clear someone had sawed through most of Eric's leg and then left him like that. When we inspected it we knew we couldn't repair it at the site.

'We're removing him in a van and taking him to a safe and secure place, and will work with the sculptor to get him back as soon as possible.

'Already we've seen some anger from tourists and local people, and I think the general feeling is one of disbelief.'

Graham Ibbeson, the sculptor of the statue, called it a 'moronic act'. 

Cllr Tracy Brown, from Morecambe Town Council, said: 'We have a very large supportive community trying to move Morecambe forward with carnivals, festivals and creative ideas.

'People put hours of voluntary time into lifting this town to a better future. We have been let down by this disrespectful act to our community.'

It was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by TripAdvisor this year due to outstanding feedback from the website's users.

The vandalism of the statue prompted a swift response on Twitter.

The British Comedy Society tweeted: 'We're very distressed to hear this news. What an awful thing to have happened.'

The official Morecambe FC Twitter feed said: 'Unbelievable that the Eric Morecambe statue has been vandalised. Let's get him back where he belongs. #Legend', while Morecambe and Lunesdale MP David Morris tweeted: 'Awful news of vandalism of the Eric Morecambe statue. I hope that the council can get the statue back up on the promenade where it belongs.'

Only the statue's standing foot remains after the rest of it was placed face down in the back of a council van and driven away for repairs.

A 32-year-old man from Morecambe has been arrested on suspicion of attempted theft and remains in custody.

It was John Eric Bartholomew's mother Sadie who pushed her son into showbusiness when he was a youngster and Sadie who linked him up with young Ernest Wiseman, six months his senior in 1941.

Apart from war service the two were together as a double act until Eric's death in 1984.

The duo – now Morecambe & Wise – learned their trade in the music halls up and down the country until radio and TV beckoned.

Their first television show, Running Wild in 1954, was not a success and one critic even wrote 'Definition of the week: TV set—the box in which they buried Morecambe and Wise.'

The duo's famous dance was based on one performed by Groucho Marx in the film Horse Feathers

Seven years later at ITV they launched Two of a Kind with writers Dick Hills and Sid Green. In 1968, they were signed to the BBC where after one series Hills & Green left and the boys hired Eddie Braben to write their shows.

It was Braben who introduced their 'personalities' with Ernie a miser with short fat hairy legs, and the 'plays wot [he] wrote'. He also had them sharing a bed. Eric was concerned that people might think they were a gay couple, hence he always smoked a pipe in the bedroom scenes. Braben silenced his criticism by pointing out if it was good enough for Laurel & Hardy to share a bed, it would be good enough for Morecambe & Wise. Braben along with producer John Ammonds and choreographer Ernest Maxin (who succeeded Ammonds as producer) made the duo the best-loved comedy pairing of the Seventies.

It was a huge honour for celebrities to appear on The Morecambe & Wise Show, especially the Christmas special and among them were Dame Flora Robson, Penelope Keith, Laurence Olivier, Sir John Mills, Vanessa Redgrave, Eric Porter, Sir Harold Wilson, Angela Rippon, Dame Shirley Bassey, Ian Carmichael, Fenella Fielding, André Previn ('Mr Preview'), Peter Cushing (who in a running joke would keep turning up to complain that he had not been paid for an earlier appearance) and Frank Finlay as well as Glenda Jackson (as Cleopatra: 'All men are fools. And what makes them so is having beauty like what I have got...').

Eric Morecambe never liked the bed scenes with Ernie Wise, lest viewers thought them a gay couple

In 1976, they were both awarded the OBE.

Their theme tune was Bring Me Sunshine and their famous dance was based on one performed by Groucho Marx in the film Horse Feathers.

Eric suffered from heart trouble and had his first coronary on November 8, 1968 when he was 42. Although he recovered, it was always feared he would have another and thus it was on May 28, 1984, two weeks after his 58th birthday, he died after taking part in a show hosted by his close friend and comedian Stan Stennett at the Roses Theatre in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.

Ernie Wise died in 1999.

On July 23, 1999 the Queen unveiled the statue of Eric on the promenade at Morecambe.
