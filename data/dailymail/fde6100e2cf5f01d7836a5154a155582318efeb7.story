Fears: Head of MI5 Jonathan Evans admitted one British company lost £800 million because of hackers and Britain faces a huge threat from them

Criminals and rival states are using cyber terrorism on an 'industrial scale' to attack Britain's Government and its biggest businesses, the head of MI5 has said.

State-sponsored espionage has already cost one UK listed company a fortune after hackers stole details of a contract and scuppered a £800 million deal.

MI5 Director General Jonathan Evans said 'they will not be the only victims' as weaknesses in both state and commercial networks are being 'exploited aggressively' by cyber-criminals hell-bent on stealing secrets.

He added that Britain had also faced a 'credible terrorist attack plot about once a year since 9/11' and will see more of the same as a result of the Arab Spring.

And that cyber crime will become an increasing threat exploited by terrorists, 
warning of global cyber warfare between countries and terror cells, as 
well as between rival nations.

Russia and China are believed to be the nations carrying out the majority of attacks on Britain's businesses, focusing particularly on those in the oil and weapons industries.

'The extent of what is going on is astonishing. There are industrial-scale processes involving many thousands of people 
lying behind both state-sponsored cyber espionage and organised cyber 
crime,' he said in his first public speech for two years.

'Vulnerabilities in the internet are being exploited aggressively not just by criminals but also by states.

'So far, established terrorist groups have not posed a significant 
threat in this medium, but they are aware of the potential to use cyber 
vulnerabilities to attack critical infrastructure and I would expect 
them to gain more capability to do so in future.

'This is a threat to the integrity, confidentiality and availability of government information but also to business and to academic institutions.

'What is at stake is not just our Government secrets but also the safety and security of our infrastructure, the intellectual property that underpins our future prosperity and the commercially sensitive information that is the lifeblood of our companies and corporations.'

Warning: Thousands of hackers are threatening state and commercial systems at all times

Mr Evans also warned that parts of the Arab world were becoming a more permissive environment for al Qaida and Britons were travelling there to 'seek training and opportunities for militant activity'.

Some will return to the UK and pose a threat and the situation 'could get worse as events unfold,' he said.

It is believed that up to 200 British residents and nationals are currently in the Arab world and either involved in training camps, being radicalised or operationally active with terror groups.

In a rare public speech just a month before the Olympic Games begin in London, Mr Evans said the Arab world was in 'radical transition'.

'Today parts of the Arab world have once more become a permissive environment for al Qaida,' he said.

'A small number of British would be jihadis are also making their way to Arab countries to seek training and opportunities for militant activity, as they do in Somalia and Yemen.

'Some will return to the UK and pose a threat here.

'This is a new and worrying development and could get worse as events unfold.

'So we will have to manage the short-term risks if there is to be a longer-term reward from the Arab Spring.'

Yemen, Libya, Nigeria and Egypt are all understood to pose a risk.
