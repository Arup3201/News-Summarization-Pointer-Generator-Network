Margaret Johnson, 38, preyed on distracted parents and vulnerable pensioners to steal handbags and purses in a string of thefts last month

A prolific criminal known as the 'Pickpocket Queen of Birmingham' by police stuck her middle finger up at officers and shouted 'I'll be back' as she was jailed.

Margaret Johnson, 38, preyed on distracted parents and vulnerable pensioners before stealing their handbags and purses in a string of thefts last month. 

She admitted five counts of theft at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Friday and was sentenced to 43 weeks - more than 10 months - in prison.

Johnson, of no fixed address, struck twice on January 9 - just four days after she was released from prison - at a Poundland store in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.

She first pinched a purse from the pouch of a 90-year-old woman's walking frame before lifting a bag from a toddler's pushchair in another aisle of the shop.

The next day she walked off with a handbag from a shopper trying on shoes in Clarks in Birmingham city centre before repeating the trick at another store on January 12.

On January 23 she stole a handbag from high street outlet Deichman, but was spotted by undercover officers a few days later. 

Speaking after the hearing, investigating officer PC Matt Evans, of West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a systematic targeting of the vulnerable and distracted.

'Her victims included a 90-year-old woman, a mother with small children and foreign students - Johnson is the pickpocket Queen of Birmingham and a callous thief.

'She shows no remorse for targeting vulnerable people and that's why our team takes particular pleasure in putting her behind bars.

'Whilst being led from court she flicked a middle finger in my direction and shouted "I'll be back".

'Well we'll be waiting for her and if she doesn't work with our offender managers to try and break her crime habit she can expect to spend much of her life behind bars.'

West Midland Police's pickpocket team, where undercover officers pose as shoppers on the look-out for thieves, is the only specialist theft unit in the UK outside London. .

PC Evans, added: 'It's been a great success and enabled us to link offences that would otherwise have been investigated in isolation and if any emerging trends or new tactics are identified all UK forces can be quickly brought up to speed.

'Most retailers have comprehensive CCTV coverage which means offenders are very likely to be caught on camera - and we know all our most prolific offenders on sight.

'It's a constant battle but one we're determined to win.

'Almost all our persistent offenders are currently behind bars and, when they are released, one of us will be waiting at the prison gates to say hello and give them a little reminder we're still here.' 

Officers also hope to have a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) in place before Johnson is released from prison to ban the shoplifter from her regular haunts.
