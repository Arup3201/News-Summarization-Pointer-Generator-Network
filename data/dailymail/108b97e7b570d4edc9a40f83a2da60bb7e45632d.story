A man who was shocked to learn the beautiful woman beside him as he came out of surgery was his wife today revealed he cannot remember any of the hilarious conversation caught on camera.

Jason Mortensen and his wife Candice appeared on the Today show on Wednesday morning after the cell phone video - in which he calls her 'eye candy' and 'the prettiest woman I've ever seen' as his anesthesia wore off - became an internet sensation.

But the Utah couple was also forced to deny the video was a fake after it emerged Mr Mortensen had a profile on an auditions website where his occupation was listed as 'actor/model'.

'I can understand the skepticism,' he said, but added that he had given permission to his surgeon to tell the media that he had indeed undergone a procedure before the video was filmed.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

New-found fame: Jason Mortensen, who was filmed groggily praising his wife's beauty after leaving surgery in a hilarious video, has appeared on the Today show with his wife, Candice

Fans: The Today show hosts laughed at the video, which the couple insisted was not a fake

'I've had surgeries previously and I've been a weirdo every time,' Mortensen added. 'I'm glad she had the sense to pull out her camera.'

His wife added: 'He had been acting like that for about 20 minutes before I pulled out my phone. I thought, "I need to record this so he can see how he acts".

'He genuinely didn't remember a thing about that when I told him.'

In
the clip a bleary-eyed Mortensen lays on a hospital gurney eating a 
cracker and moaning in pain before looking over at his wife.

He asks: 
'Did the doctor send you? Man you are eye candy! Woah. You're the 
prettiest woman I've ever seen. Are you a model? Who are you? What's your name?'

Giggling from behind the lens Candice replies: 'I'm your wife.'

'I hit the jackpot!': The video taken after Mortensen underwent anesthesia for a hernia operation captures his shock at learning the beautiful woman beside him is actually his wife

Out of it: Mortensen calls his wife Candice 'eye candy' and the 'prettiest woman I've ever seen' in the video

Apparently dumbfounded, Mortensen murmurs: 'You're my wife?! Holy s***! Dang. How long? Man, I hit the jackpot!'

Mr Mortensen said he was undergoing surgery for a hernia repair to fix residual tears from a previous surgery.

'This was my fifth surgery within our six years of marriage and she's been by my side through all of it,' he said. 'In a previous surgery I suffered a severe complication and we didn't know if I'd ever function the same again. She is the love of my life.'

But claims that the video was faked were circulating last night after an old profile of Jason Mortensen was found on an auditions website where his occupation is listed as 'actor/model'.

Describing himself as 'very ambitious'
and listing a range of sports including soccer, baseball and motorcross
among his special skills, the aspiring actor says his objectives are 
movies, TV shows and commercials.

Another development sawÂ Dr.
Larry Squire, a memory loss specialist at the University of California 
San Diego, also cast doubt on the clip which now has millions of Youtube 
hits.

'Love of my life': Jason and Candice married six years ago and he has had five surgeries during that time

Speaking to Slate
Dr Squire said that the type of amnesia which would cause somebody to 
forget parts of their life is a psychiatric condition and is not 
associated with surgery.

Amnesia
caused by a lack of oxygen in surgery usually stops people from making 
new memories rather than forgetting old ones and is more similar to 
Alzheimer's, he explained.

Dr.
Squire added that while a lack of oxygen could cause a patient to 
forget some things, it wouldn't wipe out six years of marriage.

But the Mortensens' denial that the video is no fake will no doubt please the legion of commenters
who were quick to praise him as 'husband of the year'.

One user had lamented: 'Why can't I find a guy like this!'

Another added: 'I can't decide 
who is the genius of this operation. Jason, for saying this on camera or
his wife for making sure it was documented!'
