Famous: Lil Bub suffers from a rare bone deformity which means that her tongue is almost always sticking out and she has deformed paws

But Lil Bub has become a worldwide internet hit despite her unusual look - she suffers a rare bone deformity which leaves her unable to close her mouth and her tongue almost constantly sticking out.

The tiny cat's disability also means she has no teeth, a deformity in her paws, and six claws.

But she has followed in the pawsteps of other famous felines such as Maru and Grumpy Cat and hit the big time.

Her rise to stardom began when owner Michael Bridavsky began taking pictures of Lil Bub with some of the music artists who came to record at his Indiana music studio.

Michael would post the pictures of his unusual looking pet on the studio's blog for the amusement of his friends but soon began to be contacted by strangers wanting more.

The Cat has now amassed a staggering 125,000 fans on her Facebook page alone and has thousands of followers on Twitter and YouTube.

She has her own book, Lil Bub's Lil Book: The Extraordinary Life Of The Most Amazing Cat On The Planet, and was most recently photographed being held by Robert Di Niro at the Tribeca Film Festival where she starred in a documentary about the phenomenon of famous cats called Lil Bub and Friends.

Lil Bub is by no means the first cat to take the internet by storm.

Japanese cat Maru's antics have been viewed millions of times on YouTube and he even has his own blog.

Tadar Sauce, also known as the Grumpy Cat, also became an internet sensation when his picture was posted on Reddit.
