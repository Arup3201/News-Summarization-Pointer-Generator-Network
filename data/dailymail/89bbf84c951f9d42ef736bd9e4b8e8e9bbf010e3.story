British detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are probing claims a middle-aged couple 'soothed' the child the evening before she was abducted, it has been reported.

Scotland Yard are also believed to be re-interviewing holidaymakers and staff at the complex where the three-year-old was last seen as part of an ongoing review into her abduction.

They have drawn up a list of suspects, including British cleaners and Portuguese manual workers, who have been identified as 'people of interest' during a review of the inquiry.

Detectives are believed to be investigating whether a couple comforted a crying Madeleine McCann

Scotland Yard are focusing their investigation on the blocks surrounding Block 5, where the McCanns were staying and believe the abductor may have been staying on the resort in Praia Da Luz, Portugal

Detectives are also probing whether the kidnapper was staying on one of the holiday flats at the Ocean Club.

Madeleine disappeared in May, 2007, as her parents Gerry and Kate ate dinner with friends about 50 yards away at a tapas bar.

She was left in the family's rented apartment at the resort in Praia de Luz, along with twin siblings Sean and Amelie.

Two witnesses said they saw a middle-aged couple enter the apartment to comfort Madeleine, who was crying, The Sunday Express has reported.

The newspaper quoted a source as saying: 'Apparently they were concerned about the crying and went to see if they could comfort the girl.'

Detectives are now believed to be trying to identify the couple as part of an ongoing review into the case - codenamed Operation Grange.

The investigation is now thought to be focusing on a small number of apartment blocks close to block 5, where the McCann family were staying.

The investigation includes identifying the owners, holidaymakers and those who may have illegally been subletting the flats at the time Madeleine disappeared.

Blocks four and six, which are situated either side of the McCann building, and block two, which is behind their apartment, are the central to the investigation.

There are fears that someone staying in the complex may have been able to watch the family's movements from their flat.

Among those detectives want to speak to are British cleaners and 'low-level' workers, such as handymen and gardeners, The Mail on Sunday learned.

Some are thought to have been employed by the Ocean Club complex on a 
casual basis and may have already been interviewed.

Police
are said to be keen to trace six British cleaners who were working in 
Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished and who did not appear in the 
Portuguese files.

They are 
said to have used a white van and went from apartment to apartment 
offering their services, chiefly concentrating on expats.

A British owner of one of the apartments said he had been asked about the cleaners by police from Operation Grange and had been told that blocks five, six, two and four were of particular interest.

He told The Sunday Mirror: 'Every one of the properties they are interested in is right next door to, or on top of, the one where the little girl went missing.

'The officer said the people of interest were located in one of those blocks at the time'.

Detective Chief 
Superintendent Hamish Campbell, head of Scotland Yard’s Homicide and 
Serious Crime Command, said this week that he believes Madeleine may still be alive - despite it being five years since her disappearance.

He said: 'You only have to look at the case in 
Cleveland, Ohio, and the European cases. Of course there is a 
possibility she is alive. But the key is to investigate the case and, 
alive or dead, we should be able to try and discern what happened.’

Despite the extraordinary amount of publicity Madeleine's disappearance generated, she has not been seen since May, 2007.

Jane Tanner, who was at the tapas bar with the McCanns, told police she saw a man carrying a child the night Madeleine disappeared.

However, no one has ever been traced.

Detectives examining the Portuguese 
files were alarmed that the original inquiry had not traced and 
interviewed all the staff and holidaymakers who were at the Ocean Club 
when Madeleine went missing. 

Last
year the Met said that it had identified 195 fresh leads that should 
have been investigated either by conducting further witness interviews, 
eliminating suspects or carrying out forensic tests that were missing 
from the 2007 inquiry.

Officers
found unexplained gaps in the investigation timeline and that there had
been a complete lack of forensic examination of mobile phone activity 
in the area on the night Madeleine disappeared.

However, police in Portugal said they would only reopen the case if new evidence came to light.

A spokesman for the McCanns said earlier this week: ‘They have been encouraged from the moment the review started and
are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of 
people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry.’
