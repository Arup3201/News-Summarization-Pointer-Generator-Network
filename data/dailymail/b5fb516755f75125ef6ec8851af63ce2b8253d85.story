A British birdwatcher enjoying a sunshine holiday in Portugal thought he was experiencing a case of deja vu when he captured a tiny bird.

When Dave Clifton examined the identification ring on the leg of the blackcap he thought it bore an uncanny similarity to the one he had ringed weeks earlier.

But that was 1,500 miles away close to his home Staffordshire and the chances of capturing the same bird twice are almost incalculable.

But after a quick phone call to his wife back home, who checked in his ringing book, he found he had pulled off the most amazing fluke.

The coincidence was the talk of the twitching world yesterday with enthusiasts wondering whether a case like it had ever been recorded before.

Last night Mr Clifton, 57, was unavailable for comment as the keen ornithologist was out birdwatching and ringing again with twitchers.

But Colin McShane, 63, a fellow 'ringer' from the Brewood Ringers, said he had been completely bowled over by the freak coincidence.

He said the group had travelled to Vilamoura in Portugal to join an international team catching migrating birds to check them for leg tags to see where they had flown from in Europe while making their way to Africa where they usually spend the winter.

Mr McShane said ‘I extracted a male blackcap from one of our standard mist nets and was very pleased, although not too surprised, to find that it was carrying a British Trust for Ornithology ring. 

'Back at the processing station, I read out the bird's ring number several times for accuracy.’

He said: ‘Dave went quiet, then he quickly got on the phone to his wife, who checked in his ringing book back home in Staffordshire.

‘And Hey Presto - the bird was indeed one of two blackcaps he had ringed at Duckley Plantation, on the north shore of the Blithfield Reservoir in Staffordshire, on September 11 2014, a few weeks before we had left for Portugal.’

He said the rare coincidence was one of those once-in-a-lifetime occurrences and it left fellow birdwatchers completely stunned.

‘Unfortunately Dave wasn't able to buy a Lottery ticket on that day, but it must be a given that he was pretty certain of a big win with that kind of luck,’ he added.

A distinctive greyish warbler the size of a sparrow, the male has a black cap and the female has a chestnut one and its distinctive fluting song has earned it the name 'northern nightingale'.

According to experts, it is primarily a summer visitor to the UK, but birds from Germany and north-east Europe are increasingly spending the winter in the UK.

An estimated half a billion birds, from huge eagles to tiny warblers, migrate from Europe and Asia to Africa in the autumn and fly back in the spring.
