A former sheriff's deputy kept his wife and a man he suspected of being her boyfriend captive for more than two hours, beating and sexually assaulting them because he was enraged over their affair, a prosecutor said today.

The horrific details of the case were laid out in the prosecution's opening statement at the trial of Robert McClain, 38, who could receive a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.

The 12-year marriage of McClain and his wife was crumbling, and she became involved with a 23-year-old man for about four months, Orange County Deputy District Attorney John Christl told jurors.

Insanity plea: Robert McClain is accused of beating, torturing and sexually assaulting his wife and her boyfriend when he found out about their affair

McClain eventually found out and persuaded his wife to let him meet his romantic rival â€” a musician who had moved to California to audition for American Idol.

Authorities say the confrontation took place at a leasing office in Irvine where McClain's wife worked.

A break room became a makeshift torture chamber, with McClain using two guns and a knife he had brought to the meeting, Christl said.

McClain, a former Marine, repeatedly struck the man with his fists, asking him how many times he slept with his wife, then took a knife and slashed the victim's face, arm and groin, Christl said.

Propping him up on a chair, McClain said: 'Are you glad you cheated with my wife, now?'

At one point, McClain gave his wife a gun loaded with one bullet to kill the man, Christl said. On the fourth try, she fired, but no one was injured.

'He gave her an empty gun,' Christl said.

McClain's defense attorney, Deputy Public Defender Darren Thompson, told the jury his client had no intention of hurting anyone but snapped when he saw his wife come to the aid of her lover.

Thompson claimed his client's brain 'was on total shut down'.

'At some point he lost it,' Thompson said. 'He completely lost it.'

The man was left inside the office. McClain's wife was badly beaten, and he eventually let her drive with her three children to the hospital, Christl said.

The man was found hours later and had virtually every bone in his face broken, Christl said.

He suffered brain damage and needed four months of rehabilitation to learn how to walk and talk.

'He couldn't remember what happened,' Christl said. 'He thought he was in a car accident.'

If jurors find McClain guilty of crimes that include torture, kidnapping and sexual assault, the trial will enter a second phase when the jury must decide if he was legally sane on the night of September 28, 2008.

McClain has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.

Wearing gray slacks, a striped shirt and a white skull cap, he looked at the graphic photos taken after the attacks but showed no response.

Christl said investigators found bloodied clothing, a folding knife and guns that tied McClain to the crimes.

McClain's wife was the first witness called by the prosecution and she recounted her marriage with her former husband, saying he was extremely jealous and she learned to walk with her head down so she wouldn't meet eyes with another man.

'He said that he took marriage very seriously,' she said as tears welled in her eyes. 'He said that if I ever cheated on him I would be nubbed away because he would cut all my limbs off.'
