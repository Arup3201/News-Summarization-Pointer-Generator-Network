Millions of British Gas customers will receive a 5 per cent price cut, worth £37 a year, as energy giants finally start to pass on falling wholesale costs.

The news will come as a fresh blow to Ed Miliband, who until recently advocated a 20-month price freeze.

Last night industry experts warned that the Labour policy had made firms delay price reductions for fear of being locked into bad deals.

New deal: British Gas announced today it will reduce household gas prices by five per cent, cutting annual energy bills on average by £37

The gas price cut for some 6.8million homes on the Fix & Fall variable rate tariff will start on February 28. It follows E.on’s 4 per cent reduction last week.

However, British Gas electricity prices will not change, and the saving is still tiny in the context of dramatic falls in wholesale energy prices over the past year. The cost of gas has dropped 28 per cent, and that of electricity 15 per cent.

Analysts say if firms passed on the full benefit to consumers, the average bill would be £140 a year cheaper. As recently as 2007, providers reduced bills by 17 per cent, dwarfing the current cuts.

The fall in wholesale costs has forced Labour to re-brand its price freeze as a ‘cap’, with Mr Miliband now saying he would give industry regulator Ofgem the power to force a reduction in tariffs if he won a General Election.

But British Gas yesterday warned that a Labour government bent on price controls would pose a ‘risk’ to the firm.

Asked if the prospect was a factor in its price-setting, British Gas finance director Michael Uzielli said: ‘We’re conscious of it as well as all of the other risks that we face in the market.’

Martin Lewis, of consumer finance website MoneySavingExpert.com, said the threat of a price freeze had led energy firms to limit cuts.

Falling: Wholesale gas prices have tumbled since the end of 2013 - but the costs have not been passed on. Units are measure in pence per therm - equal to about 96.7 cubic feet of natural gas

He said: ‘We are seeing smaller cuts than we would have done otherwise.

‘Nice idea, but by pre-announcing it, they have ruined it. By going for electoral gain, by saying “We are doing this aren’t we wonderful, we’re going to freeze your prices”, what they have done is self-defeated their own policy.’

David Cameron seized on the British Gas announcement, telling ITV News: ‘We should be absolutely clear that this price cut would not be happening if we’d listened to Labour and put in place their 20-month price freeze.’

But experts said a 5 per cent cut was too little, too late.

Ofgem is so concerned about the failure to pass savings on to customers that it has referred the energy industry to a full inquiry by the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA), which could take a year to complete.

Gillian Guy, of Citizens Advice, said: ‘The savings being offered remain disappointingly low, but if E.on and British Gas can cut prices other firms must now do the same. Energy bills have risen by a third since 2010, yet wholesale costs are at a four-year low.’

Mr Miliband defended Labour’s revamped ‘price cap’, saying: ‘A 5 per cent fall . . . is not nearly good enough. If the Conservatives want a competition about who can properly stand up to energy companies, I say bring it on.’

Iain Conn, the head of British Gas’s parent company Centrica, claimed it made cuts as early as possible in a ‘volatile’ market.

British Gas said the cut was worth £37 a year on average.
