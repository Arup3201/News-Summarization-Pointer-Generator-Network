Nick Clegg yesterday won his battle to let hard-working families earn up to £10,000 a year tax-free.

His cherished policy to benefit low earners will now be introduced in April 2014, a year earlier than expected.

But the speeded-up timetable means a record five million workers are set to pay higher rate tax by the end of next year, experts warned last night.

Cherished policy: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in Downing Street ahead of the Budget during which he won his battle to let hard-working families earn up to £10,000 a year tax-free

The numbers dragged into paying 40p income tax is expected to rise from 4.1million today to 4.9million in 2014.

The hike in personal allowance thresholds from £6,475 to £10,000 means 2.7million people have been lifted out of paying any income tax at all since 2010.

For the average taxpayer, it will amount to paying £705 less income tax compared to when the Coalition took power.

Changes announced in the Budget yesterday mean that for most people the point at which they start to pay higher rate tax will be £41,865.

It means one in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn to the Treasury – a huge blow to the household finances of nearly another million families who won't consider themselves remotely well-off.

Mike Warburton, of accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said: 'You no longer have to be wealthy to be a higher-rate tax payer.

'There will be many families who don't see themselves as wealthy who will find themselves as unwilling higher-rate taxpayers.'

Increasing numbers of workers face paying higher tax rates because of what is known as 'fiscal drag'.

Currently, everyone can earn £8,105 tax-free – then pays income tax of 20 per cent on the next £34,370.

Once they have a £42,475 salary, they then pay 40 per cent income tax for every additional pound earned. From April, the personal allowance will rise to £9,440 – and then to £10,000 next year.

Normally, the 40 per cent higher-tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living.

But from April 2014, the point at which higher rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead. This lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in this 40 per cent net.

In 1978, only three per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate. In 1989, the figure had barely moved to just five per cent.

Under Gordon Brown, the figure rose to 3.8 million before falling back to three million when the Coalition was elected in 2010. However, under the current Government, the figure has rocketed.

'By the end of this parliament, more than two million extra workers will have been dragged into the higher band,' Mr Warburton added.

* George Osborne suffered an embarrassing setback last night as his controversial scheme to allow workers to trade in their employment rights in return for shares was thrown out by the House of Lords.

Peers voted by 232 votes to 178 against the proposal, which would allow staff to give up key employment rights in return for shares in the company worth anything from £2,000 to £50,000.

Ten Tory rebels voted against the plans, including the former Cabinet ministers Lord Lawson, Lord King, Lord Forsyth and Lord Deben.

Former head of the Civil Service Lord O'Donnell said the plans would be 'very harmful to growth'.

'In the old days the price of slavery was 20 or 30 pieces of silver – is it now £2,000?' he asked.

The Chancellor unveiled the 'shares for rights' plan at the Tory conference last October.

He said it would boost entrepreneurial companies and allow staff to share in their growth.

But critics argued that basic rights such as redundancy pay and unfair dismissal provisions should be preserved for all.
