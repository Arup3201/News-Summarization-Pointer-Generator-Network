Smiling: McKinlay, who boasted her two favourite things were 'money and sex', was cleared of running a £500,000 prostitution racket yesterday

As a woman whose career has long 
revolved around her two favourite things – money and sex – Marie 
McKinlay knows the value of appearance.

During her two-week stint at 
Southwark Crown Court, where she was accused of controlling a 
£500,000-a-year high-class prostitution ring, the 40-year-old 
established something of a routine.

Each morning, she would walk up the 
court steps dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a loose jumper, make-up 
free face largely hidden beneath a pair of over-sized sunglasses.

Once inside, the seven-months 
pregnant mother-of-two would head to the lavatories where she would slip
 into a sophisticated black dress and apply her make up.

‘I don’t need 
to impress them [the photographers waiting outside],’ she declared as 
she sat outside the courtroom one morning.

The meaning of this pronouncement was
 clear – the only people Marie McKinlay wanted to make a positive 
impression on were judge and jury.

It must have worked, for yesterday 
McKinlay was cleared of controlling prostitution for gain and of 
converting criminal property (more commonly known as money laundering) 
between December 2008 and July 2011.

She raised her trembling hands to her
 mouth and burst into tears as the verdict was read out.

It leaves her 
free, if she chooses, to resume business.

Prostitution is not illegal, but 
controlling prostitutes is and there is no doubt that McKinlay has 
reaped the benefits of a lucrative trade, albeit working within the law.

She was cleared after the jury heard 
that she did not control the girls who worked at Agency Allure with an 
iron fist, but instead acted as their agent, taking only a commission 
payment.

The girls, she said, were her 
friends.

One is godmother to her children – she has two daughters aged 
eight and nine – and she is about to be maid of honour to another.

So who is Marie McKinlay, and what 
took a West End wardrobe assistant from backstage at Miss Saigon to the 
top of a lucrative, but decidedly less salubrious industry, earning 
enough money to put her daughters through private school in Hampshire?

McKinlay – or Claudia as she was 
known to Allure’s clients – was born in Stoke Newington, North London, 
in 1972.

Her mother Ruth, 56, was an insurance clerk. No father’s name 
was listed on her birth certificate.

At her home in Lewisham yesterday, Mrs McKinlay said only that she was ‘embarrassed’ by her daughter’s predicament.

The young McKinlay spent her 
formative years in Scotland with grandparents James and Wilma, only 
returning to London at the age of 12. After leaving school, she began 
work as a wardrobe assistant.

This, however, was not enough for a young woman with pound signs in her eyes.

Her ‘hostess skills’ were honed at 
the Stork Club, in Piccadilly, a venue owned by vice king Oscar Owide – 
once described as Britain’s biggest pimp – who served a prison sentence 
for VAT fraud.

McKinlay claims she left the club because she ‘got 
sick of the drinking’, telling jurors she had to ‘drink champagne and 
only champagne’ from 9pm to 2am every day.

The enterprising McKinlay used her 
‘experience’ as a stepping stone, working independently as an escort 
before setting up Allure.

The picture she painted in court 
could not have been further removed from the gritty underbelly of the 
vice industry.

Agency Allure, she said, was a group enterprise, formed 
with five other women over a bottle of Chardonnay at the upmarket 
department store Selfridges. It was, apparently, to be a business where 
‘women were in control’.

Asked why she began in the trade, she
 declared: ‘I’ve been asked this question many times and the way I 
answer it is, my two favourite things in the world are money and sex. I 
absolutely love both of them, and a job that allows me to put them both 
together, why wouldn’t I?’

The glamorous brunette was once a wardrobe assistant backstage at Miss Saigon

Listening to McKinlay, the world of 
sex for sale appears to be one long merry-go-round of worldwide travel –
 Dubai, Paris, Geneva – high-class hotels and money.

As for the clients,
 McKinlay declared them ‘a class of gentlemen I had never met before’.

Exactly what class of gentlemen is 
drawn to an agency offering ‘busty London escorts’ who provide 
everything from ‘girlfriend experience to porn star experience’?

Well, ones that can afford up to £500 for an hour or £2,500 for a 14-hour overnight stay with the girl of their choice.

By 2003 McKinlay’s involvement with 
the trade appears to have been more administrative.

She was pregnant 
with her first girl, now nine, and began running the agency from her new
 home in Southampton.

She had a second daughter a year 
later and by 2008 she was the sole founding member of Allure – and 
presumably the sole beneficiary of whatever was left, after advertising 
costs, of the 30 per cent commission each girl handed over.

In court it 
was said McKinlay earned £90,000 in the first six months of 2011 alone.

Her business acumen, if one can call it that, appears to come from the most unlikely source.

‘Let’s just say that I have a lot of 
respect for John Lewis’s ethos of “Never Knowingly Undersold”,’ she 
declared when being quizzed about her pricing policy on an internet 
forum last year. ‘I think that it’s a good way for ANY business to 
behave.’

Quite what solidly respectable John Lewis would make of her use of its phrase is open to conjecture.

So
 what of McKinlay’s daughters? Their birth certificates, like their 
mother’s, have a blank space where a  father’s name should be.

McKinlay did marry, in 1998 at 
Chelsea Register Office to a 25-year-old English student.

Curiously, 
however, friends knew nothing of the marriage and say he is gay. It 
ended in divorce last year, on the basis that they had lived apart for 
more than five years. He says only ‘it was a long time ago’.

McKinlay was arrested by British 
Transport Police, who had been investigating sex trafficking.

She did 
not, it should be made clear, take part in trafficking, but the 
investigation led to her because she is believed to have unknowingly 
acted as agent for someone who had been trafficked.

Until then, she had rented the  £1,500-a-month home in a wealthy suburb of Southampton.

A neighbour said: ‘Everybody in the 
square was gossiping about what she did for a living. She always walked 
very tall and proud, was well-spoken and smartly dressed – but never 
extravagantly. Her fashion sense certainly never gave any indication of 
what she did for a living.’

Since her arrest, McKinlay has been 
living in a modern four-bedroom property, complete with solar panels, 
perched on a hilltop in a village near Frome, Somerset, with her 
29-year-old former next-door neighbour Adrian Noakes.

A local said: ‘We thought there was 
something a bit odd about the pair of them. They never seemed to go 
anywhere and hardly anyone ever seemed to visit them. They had two 
children with them.

‘Marie claimed to be running a firm which can push a firm up the internet search listings.

‘We hadn’t seen Marie for a few days and now we know why.’
