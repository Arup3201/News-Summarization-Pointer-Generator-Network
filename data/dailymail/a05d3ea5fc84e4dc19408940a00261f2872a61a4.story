A drunk man in New Mexico stabbed his girlfriend's 9-month-old puppy with a screwdriver, skinned the pooch and planned to serve it for dinner, police says.

Prosecutors in Torrance County have charged Salvador Martinez, 46,with felony extreme cruelty to animals on accusations that he killed his girlfriend's black-and-white chiweenie Onyx, a mix of dachshund and Chihuahua.

He's also charged with child abuse.

“The [grandchildren] were present inside the residence and had full knowledge of what was taking place with their family pet,” Sheriff Heath White told KRQE.

Salvador Martinez, 46, is behind bars after being charged in the killing of his girlfriend's 9-month-old puppy Onyx.

Martinez, of Edgewood, told authorities that he took little Onyx into the backyard and pierced her heart with a screwdriver on July 18.

He then skinned the pooch and stored the dog's carcass in the fridge while he looked up dog meat recipes — and whether eating it was illegal.

'He had her marinating in Italian dressing in the fridge,'  said the man's girlfriend, Mandy Malone, to KOAT.

Malone — who lives with another eight dogs, five cats and a few chickens — said Martinez had been drunk the night before and became angry when the dogs started barking, according to KRQE.

'He said he was going to kill one and barbecue it,' she told the station. 'I didn’t believe him because he’d been saying it for a while and I knew he loved animals.'

When she confronted him about the meat in the fridge, Martinez told Malone that, if she didn't like it, he'd just take the pooch to barbecue at his mother's house.

'Nobody knows what to think, nobody's ever heard of this before,' Mandy Malone told KOAT.

'He'd said it before, but jokingly,' she added. 'Just out of the blue: I'm going to barbecue one of your dogs.'

New Mexico is one of a handful of states where the law doesn't say much about the eating of dogs and cats.

But prosecutors say no matter what the law says, it is certainly illegal to kill them in such a cruel manner.

“It is extremely disturbing to know that someone would be that brutal with a family animal,” White said.

Martinez claimed to investigators that he killed Onyx to feed the family.

Malone says there was plenty of food in the house.

“It makes me sick to think about it – I haven’t been able to eat or sleep,” she told the Albuquerque Journal.

Martinez is in federal custody for violating his probation on a 2003 conviction for trying to smuggle 13 kilos of cocaine through the US-Mexico border.

He pleaded guilty to that crime and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
