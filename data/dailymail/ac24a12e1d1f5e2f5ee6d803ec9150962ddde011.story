Experts have used a radical new satellites to capture unique psychedelic images of the ruptures in the Earth's crust caused by the Napa earthquake.

Radar images from the UK's Sentinel-1A satellite have been used to map the biggest earthquake that has shaken northern California in 25 years.

The images reveal the rupture is larger than previously thought.

By processing two Sentinel-1A images, which were acquired on 7 August and 31 August 2014 over this wine-producing region, an interferogram was generated. The two round shapes around Napa valley, which are visible in the central part of the image, show how the ground moved during the quake.

The satellite uses a technique called 'Synthetic aperture radar interferometry'.

This uses two or more satellite radar images of the same area are combined to detect large-scale surface changes.

Small changes on the ground modify the reflected radar signal and lead to rainbow-coloured fringes in the 'interferogram'.

Each colour cycle corresponds to a deformation of 28 mm deformation. 

The maximum deformation is more than 10 cm, and an area of about 30x30 km was affected significantly.

Yngvar Larsen from Norway's Northern Research Institute and Petar Marinkovic from PPO.labs in the Netherlands processed this new interferogram from two images: one that Sentinel-1A acquired on 7 August, the day the satellite reached its operational orbit, and another captured on 31 August.

It clearly confirms that part of the West Napa Fault system was responsible for the 6.0 earthquake that rocked California's wine-producing region.  

However, the fault had not been identified as being particularly hazardous prior to the quake that hit on 24 August.

Importantly, the extent of the ground deformation in the interferogram shows that the fault slip continues further north than the extent of the rupture mapped at the surface.

Sharp lines in the interferogram show minor movements on other faults, such as the part of the West Napa Fault system that crosses Napa airport.

The maximum deformation is more than 10 cm, and an area of about 30x30 km was affected significantly. 

Austin Elliott, a PhD student at the University of California Davis, is one of the team mapping the earthquake rupture on the ground.

Researchers have also been on the ground to examine the damage to the local area

He said, 'The data from satellites are invaluable for completely identifying the surface break of the earthquake – deformation maps from satellite imagery guide us to places where rupture has not yet been mapped.'

Tim Wright, from University of Leeds said, 'This successful demonstration of Sentinel-1A marks the beginning of a new era for our ability to map earthquakes from space.

'COMET scientists are building a system that will provide these results routinely for all continental earthquakes, as well as mapping the slow warping of the ground surface that leads to earthquakes.' 

Sentinel-1A passes over the same spot on the ground every 12 days. 

However, once its identical twin, Sentinel-1B, is launched in 2016, this will be cut to just six days, so that changes can be mapped even faster
