Dangerous driving: Assistant headteacher Vera Baxter caused a head-on car crash after her Ugg boot became trapped under her brake pedal

A teacher wearing Ugg boots caused a head-on collision when one of her shoes became trapped under a brake pedal.

Assistant headteacher Vera Baxter, 49, was unable to slow her VW Golf down because her footwear had become snagged on the pedal and she took evasive action to avoid hitting cars in front.

However, she veered into the path of a Mercedes being driven by Jason Hoang, 33, in Manchester city centre.

She had also caused a police patrol car to swerve out of her way just moments before hitting the car of Mr Hoang from Middlewich, Cheshire.

Baxter was arrested and charged with dangerous driving after being treated for cracked ribs and internal bruising. Mr Hoang suffered from whiplash.

After the crash, Baxter tore her boot away from the pedal and crawled free from the wreckage.

She was banned from driving for four months and fined £350.

She told Manchester Crown Court how she thought she was going to die when she lost control of her vehicle on her way home 
after visiting a friend in nearby Stretford.

She said: 'My Ugg boot got trapped at the traffic lights.

'I suppose it was a freak accident - as I put my boot across the prong of the pedal it caught in the seams.

'I attempted to free it with my left 
hand and then swerved to the right to avoid going into the back of 
vehicles in front of me. There seemed to me more space on the right-hand
side to avoid oncoming traffic.

'I can’t tell you how terrifying it 
was. When the crash happened the airbags came out, I smashed my head on 
the steering wheel. I could smell horrible petrol smells, I thought the 
car was going to catch fire, I thought I was going to die.

'Basically I just yanked the boot out
forcibly with both hands because I thought the car was going to 
explode. I pulled it out and the edge of the wool ripped. I threw myself
out of the car, crawling to the middle of the road. 

'I had the boots
for a year and they were my first pair of Ugg boots. It’s a freak risk 
but I keep a pair of trainers in the car now.'

Judge Martin Steiger QC told Baxter that she bore responsibility for the October 30 smash last year because the risk posed by driving in the boots was ‘entirely foreseeable’.

Judge Steiger said: 'It was the defendant’s choice of footwear that made her unable to control the vehicle when the crisis arose.'

The crash is the latest in a string of accidents caused by motorists wearing unsuitable footwear behind the wheel.

Motoring groups said a quarter of drivers admitted putting themselves and others in danger by wearing everything from high heels to flip-flops, Wellington boots - and even clogs.

And a poll by road-safety group Brake found 40pc of women admitted to having driven in high-heels. An AA spokesman said: 'It is common sense that when you are driving you should be wearing appropriate footwear.'
