The Salvadoran fisherman who miraculously survived 13 months at sea before he was found last January is being sued by his former lawyer for $1 million, his family has revealed.

A year after he came ashore on the Marshall Islands, Jose Alvarenga, 38, is also at odds with relatives of the man who died at sea with him, who do not believe his story, NBC News reported.

'Jose has no money,' his brother-in-law, Jorge Bonilla, told NBC. 'As a family, we try to help him by sending money for food and medicine.'

But it's not all bad news for Alvarenga, whose family say that he is back to good health at home in El Salvador after more than a year surviving on fish, rainwater and his urine aboard a 24-foot boat.

New challenges: A year after Jose Alvarenga was found following 13 months at sea, he is being sued by his former lawyer and is at odds with the family of the man who died during the voyage. He is pictured last April

He is even talking about going fishing again, Bonilla said.

He is also collaborating on a book - and perhaps a documentary - but his former attorney and family friend, Benedicto Perlera, is not happy at being left out of the deal, NBC reported.

The duo had a falling out and the attorney now represents the family of Ezequiel Cordoba, 24, who died of hunger and thirst weeks after he and Alvarenga were thrown off course by bad weather. 

Perlera said the Cordobas believe they are entitled to profits from Alvarenga's story - even though they are skeptical about his tale.

He told authorities that the fish and turtles they caught to eat did not agree with Cordoba's stomach and he died. He denied eating his friend and says he threw the man's body overboard.

'They don't think their son died the way Jose says he did,' Perlera told NBC.

Perlera has also filed a $1 million breach of contract suit against Alvarenga after he says the former fisherman dropped him for a U.S.-based law firm.

'We would have been very successful together,' he said. 'Jose's story is worth a lot of money.'

His new lawyer, Jeffrey Masonek, said a publisher has bought Alvarenga's story.

It will be written by Guardian journalist Jonathan Franklin, who wrote '33 Men' about the Chilean miners trapped underground for 69 days in 2010, NBC reported.

Alvarenga and Cordoba vanished in November 2012 after they headed out to hunt sharks in Mexico. They were hit by a storm and swept out to sea.

Five days after Cordoba failed to return, his family in Chiapas reported him missing and began searching for him, his aunt Lucia Cordoba Cruz said.

'Our family looked for him in the sea, in other villages, always hoping to find him,' she said - but their search ended about three weeks later in December 2012.

Astonishing feat: Thirteen months after heading out on a shark hunting trip from Mexico, he came ashore on the Marshall Islands, which are about 5,500 miles from where he set off

Back home: He is pictured arriving back home with relatives after being found in January 2014

Thirteen months later, on January 30, 2014, a bearded and bedraggled Alvarenga was rescued and told an astonishing tale of how he survived by eating raw fish, turtles and birds.

'I always had faith that I was going to survive, asking (God) every day and every night,' he told the media after he landed back home. 'I never lost faith that one day I would be found.' 

There was skepticism about his story after doctors deemed Alvarenga to be in strikingly good health, although he was mentally frail, dehydrated and limping.

But he stood by his story and survival experts and oceanographers said it was possible. Months after setting foot on land again, he passed a lie detector test.

'I think he is doing fine,' his new attorney told NBC. 'He's very, very grateful to be alive.'

Alvarenga is relying on family handouts and is being sued by his former lawyer for breach of contract 'for ditching him for another lawyer'
