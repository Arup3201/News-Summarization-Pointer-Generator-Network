A Sydney mayor who was allegedly assaulted at a primary school on Saturday afternoon has been taken to hospital unconscious after he was reportedly 'king hit'.

Bill Pickering - who is the mayor of Ryde in Sydney's northwest - was handing out sandwiches when he was confronted by independent candidate Vic Tagg, deputy mayor Roy Maggio told Nine News.

Cr Maggio, who was also at Putney Public School for a council by-election today, says the mayor was 'king hit'.

It is believed the mayor then fell to the ground and had a seizure.

'He [Mr Tagg] king hit him [Cr Pickering] front on and the mayor fell down,' Liberal Cr Maggio told Nine News.

Witnesses say Cr Pickering - a member of the Liberal party - was handing out sandwiches to voters at a council polling booth for Ryde’s East Ward by-election, when Mr Tagg claimed the Liberal party was 'corrupt' before allegedly punching the mayor.

The by-election was prompted by the resignation of former mayor and independent councillor Ivan Petch in December.

Mr Petch withdrew his position from council after the Independent Commission against Corruption made corrupt conduct findings against him. 

A police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia inquiries are continuing as they are currently questioning a number of witnesses.

No arrests have been made.

Police were called to the school on Morrison Road at about 2pm today, following reports of an assault.

'Initial investigations suggest that a 52-year-old man was assaulted by another man known to him, who left the school before police arrived,' a police spokesperson said.

Cr Pickering, the 52-year-old, was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Ryde Hospital.

Fellow Liberal councillor Craig Chung told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked when he heard about the alleged assault.

'Violence of any sort is a terrible blight on our democracy and violence allegedly from a candidate is just deplorable,' he said.

Cr Chung says he was told the mayor will be spending the night in hospital.

He is believed to be in a stable condition.

Police are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward.
