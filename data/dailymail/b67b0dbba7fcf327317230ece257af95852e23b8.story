From its beautiful temples to its stunning mountain ranges, there's a lot to see in Pakistan.

But one of its lesser known attractions is the vibrantly painted trucks that can be spotted travelling around the country.

As far from the traditionally dull looking arctic lorries as its possible to get, these hand-painted trucks are pieces of moving art.

The ancient Pakistani practice of drivers decorating their trucks has its roots in the days of the raj when craftsmen made colourful horse drawn carriages for the gentry.

Years of history: The tradition of drivers decorating their trucks dates back to the days of the raj when craftsmen made colourful horse drawn carriages for the gentry

The tradition continued with drivers decorating their vehicles to attract custom and to thank God for prosperity.

Different regions developed their own styles over time and many of the images painted on the side of the vehicles served as reminders of home for drivers on long journeys.

Trucks from the region of Swat are distinctive for their carved wooden doors and limited use of plastic and hammered metalwork.

Although Pakistan is often described as a nation of low economic status, large amounts of money will change hands to decorate trucks.

Many truck owners will pay between $3,000 and $5,000 to decorate their vehicles.

Nationwide: Colourful and intricately painted trucks are a tradition in Pakistan and each region has developed its own style

Costly: The average owner of a truck may spend over $3,000 on paint and metal designs for his vehicle which can be three times more than his monthly wages

Constant companion: The average truck owner may see his truck more than his wife so they feel it is important to make it look pretty

Pretty but lethal: There are around 180,000 creaking trucks and tankers plying Pakistan's treacherous highways

Dividing art: Truck art was also a way to differentiate trucks in Pakistan from those in India after the countries split in 1947

One paint workshop owner Hussain Noor, 58, has been painting trucks for 43 years and one of his trucks is displayed in a museum in Germany. 

This collection of images shows drivers adding the finishing touches of paint to their trucks at his studio in Rawalpindi.

Many have painted colorful floral patterns or creative depictions of heroes alongside calligraphy of poetic verses on their vehicles.

Each part of the truck is decorated differently and can contain numerous themes.

Shelf life: The vehicles have an average age of 30 years and every part is replaced to keep the vehicle running as long as possible

For good luck: The tradition of truck painting remained largely unchanged for the last 50 years, with drivers decorating their vehicles to attract custom and to thank God for prosperity
