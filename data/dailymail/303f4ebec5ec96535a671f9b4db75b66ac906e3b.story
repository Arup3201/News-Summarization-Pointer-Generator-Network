For the brave pilots, it was not some corner of a foreign field that became their final resting place - rather the very heartland of England.

And today poppies were laid in their honour in the hills of Derbyshire's Peak District whose mountaintops claimed the lives of 157 airmen during the Second World War.

Two small ceremonies at two remote spots where ten of the Brits were killed after their planes smashed into the treacherous gritstone plateau Kinder Scout.

One hundred and twenty two military aeroplanes succumbed to the cloud-concealed peaks along the remote mountain range during the war.

Many crash sites are still strewn with debris-melted and twisted metal components lie alongside large lumps of airframes, engines and landing-gear.

The RAF removed or buried much of the debris from early crash sites. But as the war lengthened many plane wrecks were left to corrode on the rocks and remote peat bogs where they lay.

Over the years many parts have been removed - some by the authorities others by trophy-hunters.

Other pieces, often scattered over large areas, have been collected and gathered together into makeshift memorials resembling aluminium cairns that are decorated with crosses, wreaths and poppies.

Eleven years ago Alan Clark, 29, began visiting, documenting and researching the crash sites.

Mr Clark said: 'My grandfather flew in the war and he was really interested in the research I was doing - he'd never spoken about the war to anyone but began to talk to me about it.

'Sadly he died before I could take him up to see any of the crash sites. I try to visit as many crash sites as possible, and I like to take up poppies on crosses to the ones I visit in November.'

Mr Clark, along with two friends, scours libraries and records offices across Britain, looking for details on the crashes and the aircrew.

A crew of 13 flying an American B29 Superfortress, known as Overexposed, were killed  at Bleaklow after getting lost on their way back to base in 1948.

In
 February 1945 three Hurricanes were practicing formation flying when, 
after flying through smog, they all crashed into the same hillside at 
Tintwhistle Knarr killing two Belgian and one British pilot.

A
 German aircraft was also lost within the borders of the Peak District 
National Park.

Four men also died when a Junkers JU88, returning from a 
bombing raid to Liverpool, crashed on The Roaches in May 1941.

His website, peakdistrictaircrashes.co.uk, lists all the crash sites. It includes an interactive map showing the distribution of all the Peak District crashes.

Every dot on his map expands to give, when known, the names of the airmen, numbers of fatalities and injuries, what mission the aircraft was attempting and how it came to crash.

'I think it's important to do this so people don't forget,' he added.

Speaking
 in thick fog, Mr Clark said: 'He's brave flying a light aircraft above 
here in these conditions - especially knowing what we're doing today.

'I'd never fly in a small plane over here in bad visibility. These are very big hills - I like to call them "Cumulus Granitus".'

Relatives
 of airmen killed in the war frequently contact Mr Clark. In 2004 he 
escorted the nephew of Sydney Peters to place a plaque at the place 
where he and three others were killed when their Handley Page Hampden 
crashed in a snow storm in 1942.

In 1943, a Handley Page Halifax, with 
electrics damaged by German flack over Frankfurt lost radio contact with
 base and, unable to find its way home, crashed on Kinder Scout killing 
five crew and injuring two.

Mr Clark, Mark Sheldon and Nick Wotherspoon published 'Aircraft Wrecks - a walkers' guide' in 2007.

The interactive map of Peak District crash sites

The book details crash sites in The 
Peak District and across the rest of Britain. Mr Clark claims to have 
visited 434 crash sites. They are currently working on a second edition 
of the book.

During wartime many aircrews often trained over the Peak District as they were safe from attack from German aircraft.

'I'd never fly in a small plane over here in bad visibility. These are very big hills - I like to call them "Cumulus Granitus".'

Many of these training flights ended in disaster when crews became lost and disorientated. Damaged aircraft also crashed returning from bombing missions over Germany and France.

Nineteen forties aircraft cruised much lower than modern aircraft so it was all-too easy to fly a little too low and into the path of high hill-tops and mountains.

Whole engines can still be seen at the largest crash site in The Peak District.

The wreckage at Bleaklow, is from an American B29 Superfortress, known as Overexposed, which crashed, killing its crew of 13, after getting lost on its way back to base in 1948. A Remembrance Day service is held here each year.

In February 1945 three Hurricanes were practicing formation flying when, after flying through smog, they all crashed into the same hillside at Tintwhistle Knarr killing two Belgian and one British pilot.

A German aircraft was also lost within the borders of the Peak District National Park. Four men died when a Junkers JU88, returning from a bombing raid to Liverpool, crashed on The Roaches in May 1941.
