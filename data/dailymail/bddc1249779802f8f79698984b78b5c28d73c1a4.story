In Harry Potter the young wizard's life is changed forever when he receives hundreds of letters inviting him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 

So when a young Potter fan suffering from leukaemia was asked what would she wish for on her sixth birthday, she had an idea.

Oliwia Gandecka, from Zielona Gora, Poland, told her parents it would be really exciting if she could be sent lots of letters just like Harry.

Her parents turned to social media to start the campaign.

Facebook and on Harry Potter forums.

Within a week more than a million cards had arrived at her house and there are still more arriving. 

'We had a problem keeping this a secret from her because there were so many.
