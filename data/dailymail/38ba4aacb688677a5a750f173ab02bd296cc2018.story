MSNBC host Alex Wagner said Thursday morning that Democratic politicians are treading lightly around Hillary Clinton out of fear that failure to enthusiastically endorse her could bring dire consequences.

‘The fear mongering around the Clintons [is] like, “Don't cross them, otherwise a door in the floor opens up,' she said.

Clinton, along with her husband the former president, reportedly build an 'enemies list' after she failed to win the Democrats' presidential nomination in 2008, keeping tabs on all the people they believed had betrayed her by siding with Barack Obama.

MSNBC host Alex Wagner joked about what some Democrats consider a deadly serious subject: the political repercussions of crossing the Clintons

Hillary Clinton is the darling of the political left but may face token -- or real -- opposition from other Democrats if she runs in 2016, but some will fear her political revenge machine

‘I think there's been a lot of reporting about the lists they keep,' Wagner said.

'And we are led to believe that there is this kind of Clinton Industrial Complex where names are kept, sins are recorded. Whether or not they are poring over those notes, you know, on a nightly basis would be very much up to the Clintons.'

'There's a feeling that you have to kind of plant your flag firmly for the Clintons,' she added. 'Especially now.'

The 2008 enemies list focused mostly on members of Congress, and rated them on a scale of 1 (most helpful0 to 7 (most treacherous).

Those with '7' ratings included John Kerry, now the secretary of state; the late Sen. Ted Kennedy; and current Democratic Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Claire McCaskill and Bob Casey.

According 
to the book 'HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton,' 
published in February, Clinton staffers would often joke about how 
black-marked pols ended up ending their careers in disgrace.

In 'HRC,' reporters Jonathan Allen and Aimie Parnes recount the construction and use of an 'enemies' list after Clinton's failed 2008 primary campaign

'Bill Richardson: investigated; John Edwards: disgraced by scandal; Chris Dodd: stepped down; ... Ted Kennedy: dead,' an aide once joked, the book claims.

Wagner's comments followed an interview of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who supported Obama eight years ago and was among the first to urge him to run for the White House.

NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd asked Reid whether Clinton should have to endure a contentious primary season if she decides to run for president.

A cautious Reid agreed without directly criticizing the former secretary of state.

'Do you think it would be better for Secretary Clinton if she had a serious Democratic rival?' Todd asked.

'I believe that the primary with Obama and Clinton was an extremely helpful process,' Reid responded. 'I think it was wonderful.'
