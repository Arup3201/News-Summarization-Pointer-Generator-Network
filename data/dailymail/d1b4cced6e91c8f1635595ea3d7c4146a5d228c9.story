Kate Moss has revealed exactly which tricks she uses to ensure she looks her best at 40

Sharing her beauty routine in this week’s Grazia magazine, the model said she begins with a facial to make sure her skin is in top condition before applying fake tan.

And giving her tips for the morning after a late night, the mother-of-one said the tan can also hide a hangover, while she recommends a cucumber water face bath and juicing to treat puffy, tired-looking skin. 

Giving a step-by-step guide in this week’s Grazia magazine, she said: ‘Nicola Joss does an amazing lymphatic drainage facial using Sanctuary Spa Wonder Oil Serum. It’s like getting a natural facelift.’

Miss Moss then uses Lucas’ Papaw Ointment, ‘for my lips in winter’, and applies a fake tan.

She said: ‘I love a tan. You just look healthier in general and you can get away with a late night with a tan – it covers up a multitude of sins, as well as making your body looked more toned and defined.

'I use St Tropez Self Tan Luxe Dry Oil on my face and body before a big night.’

Next, Miss Moss puts on her make up. 

Sharing the contents of her cosmetics bag, she said: ‘A red lip and glistening skin is my failsafe party look. It’s nice to have a neutral but glowing face and eyes and then a strong lip for a pop of colour.

‘I always use pencils on my eyes; they’re soft with a bit of a shine so you can smudge them to look just like an eye shadow. Once it’s on it doesn’t budge.’

The model’s lips will always be red – ‘My hero is Rimmel Lasting Finish by Kate Moss Lipstick in 001,’ she said, while her perfume choice is season-dependent – ‘for winter I like a fragrance that’s a bit moodier’.

And Miss Moss said she uses products to highlight her cheekbones.

She said: ‘I love to mix bronzers and highlighters to contour and bring out my cheekbones. Charlotte Tilbury does a great Filmstar Killer Cheekbones Palette that I love.’

Perhaps it should also come as no surprise that many of Miss Moss’ favourite products come from brands she has connections with. 

She is the face of Rimmel and of St Tropez, and is good friends with Charlotte Tilbury, whose bronzing powder she wears. 

Facial treatments: Sanctuary Spa Wonder Oil Serum, £19.50, and Papaw Ointment, £4Fake-tan: St Tropez Self Tan Luxe Dry Oil, £25

Lips: Rimmel Lasting Finish by Kate Moss Lipstick in 001, £5.49

Cheeks: Filmstar Killer Cheekbones Palette by Charlotte Tilbury, £82

Perfume: Ginsberg is God, 1970 and Je T’aime Jane by Bella Freud, £65 each

And for the morning after: The Super Elixir by Elle Macpherson, £39

Miss Moss is also a client of Sanctuary Spa, whose facial treatments she recommends.

Miss Moss’ reputation for being a party animal is well founded. 

The model, who makes around £12 million a year starring in campaigns for brands including Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry, is known to throw raucous, alcohol-fuelled birthday celebrations.

So it is perhaps unsurprising that her beauty regime includes hangover-hiding tricks for the following day.

Miss Moss, who is married to The Kills guitarist Jamie Hince, said: ‘If I wake up in the morning and look tired and puffy, I fill a sink with ice and cucumber and submerge my face. 

'It tightens everything, making you feel and look instantly awake.

'I saw Joan Crawford do it in the biopic Mommie Dearest. 

'I also like juicing as it gives you bright eyes with a bit of a twinkle and it keeps your hair shiny. And at the moment I’m using Elle Macpherson The Super Elixir supplement, I add it to my juices.
