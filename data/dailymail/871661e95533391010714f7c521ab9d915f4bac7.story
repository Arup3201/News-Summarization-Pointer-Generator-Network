A Brooklyn woman was sentenced to 15 years in prison for killing her friend in a fight that started on Facebook and involved actual spilled milk.

Kayla Henriques, 20, plead guilty to manslaughter Wednesday in the death of her brother's girlfriend Kamisha Richards, 22 in February 2011.

The fight happened started when Richards loaned Henriques, then 18, $20 dollars to buy supplies for her 1-year-old son Alex.

But when Henriques spent the money on something else, Richards demanded the money back and spilled out the baby's milk from the refrigerator in retaliation.

Part of the argument started on Facebook with a back-and-forth of negative posts between the two women.

Richards wrote that this was the last time Henriques would 'con' her into giving her money.

One exchange got threatening.

'IMA HAVE THE LAST LAUGH!!!' Richards posted.

'We will see,' Henriques responded.

The stabbing happened February 27 at Henrique's grandmother's house in East New York.

After spilling out the milk, the two women got physical.

'They started arguing,' Det Christopher Obdyke said in his testimony. 'They also started texting back and forth while they were in the same apartment.'

'She was close to scissors and grabbed it. I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a knife,' Henriques wrote in her confession. 'She swung and I swung. Then Kamisha kept yelling "This b**** stabbed me."'

Richards was discovered by one of her boyfriend's relatives as he returned from work.

‘She wasn't panicking,’ the relative told the New York Daily News.

‘She 
was calm. I called the ambulance and put pressure on (the wound). I did 
everything I could to try to save the girl.’

Her father cried at the crime scene to friends and relatives: ‘My daughter's dead’.

John Jay College of Criminal Justice graduate Richards, who was taken to
 Brookdale University Hospital, was hoping to apply to law school this 
autumn.

She worked as a security guard for JPMorgan Chase and was said to 
regularly help out with Henriques’s baby and be planning his birthday 
party for May.

Henriques was immediately regretful after the incident posting an apology on Facebook.

'I can't be leave this happen I'm sorry I send my condolences to her family,' she wrote. 'RIP Kamisha.'

Henriques
 will be sentences August 21. She accepted a plea deal that brought her 
charges to manslaughter and only 15 years in prison with the potential 
of 25 years to life if she had been convicted of murder.
