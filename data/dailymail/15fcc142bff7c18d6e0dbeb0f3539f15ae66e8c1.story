Kris Jenner has denied lurid claims that OJ Simpson is sending her love letters as he attempts to woo her from being bars in Nevada.

The Kardashian's matriarch, Kris, 58, has reportedly described O.J.'s letters as her 'worst nightmare'.

Indeed, despite her former husband Robert Kardashian's friendship with O.J., it is claimed that the former footballer has become fixated with Kris during the six years he has spent behind bars in Nevada since his 2008 robbery conviction.

Repeated attempts by Mail Online to get comment from Ms Jenner's representative and Mr. Simpson's were not returned.

'O.J.’s desperate for face time with Kris and has been laying it on thick in his letters, telling her how beautiful he thinks she is and what wonderful memories he has of their time together,' revealed an insider to The National Enquirer.

'Obviously her power and money is a huge attraction to him, as well as her looks – and he’s clearly got it in his head that her cash could get him an early release.'

However, another source that spoke to The National Enquirer has said that OJ's letters are 'Kris' worst nightmare!

'She wants no part of O.J., 67, but he’s pleading with her to visit him in jail and go over some very important issues that he wants to discuss with her in person.'

Old friends: O.J. Simpson and girlfriend Paula Barbieri, nine-year-old Khloe Kardashian and other celebrity golfers attend a pairings party in his Frank Sinatra Celebrity Golf Tournament in Palm Springs, California after OJ Simpson's 1995 not-guilty verdict

Indeed, Kris and OJ would party with OJ's wife Nicole and Robert Kardashian before the tragic train of events that led to Nicole's death in 1994.

Their friendship soured after Robert Kardashian helped his friend escape conviction for his estranged wife's murder and that of Ronald Lyle Goldman.

Indeed, Kris's former husband, who died in 2003, was once OJ's most trusted confidant and member of his 'Dream Team' of lawyers.

A few years after Simpson. was found not guilty of the double murder, Fred Goldman and his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and on February 5, 1997 the civil jury unanimously found the former NFL Hall-Of-Famer guilty of battery against Ron and  Nicole.

Lives cut short: Ron Goldman was 25 and Nicole Brown Simpson was 35 when they were viciously stabbed to death in front of her condominium on North Bundy Drive. Ron was stabbed almost 60 times

Fred was awarded $33.5 million in damages; he and his family have seen only a fraction of the money.

In February 1999, an auction of Simpson's Heisman Trophy and other property raised almost $500,000, which went to the Goldman family.

After realizing Goldman was never going to stop pursuing the multi-million judgment, Simpson moved from California to Florida because the state law there says a person's residence cannot be collected to satisfy a debt.

The Goldman family  also tried to seize his annual NFL pension of $25,000 a month but failed to collect any money.

The bloody glove: 'If it doesn't fit you must acquit,' said defense attorney Johnnie Cochran about the bloody glove found at the guest bungalow in back of OJ's Rockingham home. Simpson is pictured at his murder trial in 1995

In 2007 Fred and Kim went to court to fight for the rights to the profits from OJ Simpson's book 'If I Did It' and they won.

Simpson was reportedly paid an $800,000 advance by the publisher and immediately laundered the funds through the accounts of his four children so the lawyers could not trace the payment and collect it towards the civil judgment.

Simpson is currently serving his 33-year sentence with the possibility of parole after nine years. He went back to court in 2013 hoping to get his conviction overturned due to poor legal representation but his request was denied by the court stating there was no merit for his accusations.

His earliest possible release date from the Nevada prison will be in 2017.
