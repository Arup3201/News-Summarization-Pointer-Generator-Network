Before we get to the nostalgia and respect that I have for my cousin’s England career, can I just say what an embarrassment it is that no England manager got the best out of Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard playing together. 

Add Paul Scholes - all three have been masters of their art at club level.

With their talent, they should have won a European Championship to supplement their honours for Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. Or at least have made a major final. They have won 38 trophies for their clubs (so far), none for their country.

Beginnings: Lampard on his England debut - against Belgium at the Stadium of Light in October 1999 

Think about that for a moment. It was October 10, 1999 when Frank first pulled on an England shirt in a team including Tony Adams, Gareth Southgate, Alan Shearer, Paul Ince, Kieron Dyer, Steve Guppy, Martin Keown, now my Sportsmail colleague… and my cousin and I. 

It was the first time we had played together since family kick-arounds in Grandad Harry’s back garden as schoolboys.

It was a momentous occasion in my family; our parents were at the Stadium of Light, although grandad couldn’t make it up from the south coast in time. The team had only been named that morning and we didn’t expect to play together.

Frank Lampard, a 21-year-old uncapped West Ham midfielder, was selected by Kevin Keegan for his debut against Belgium in Sunderland and I was there next to him. 

After the Cloughs and the Easthams, the Lampards became only the third father and son combination to play for England. It was a big day for his mum and dad, Frank Senior and Pat.

Our elation was obvious, although there was a minute’s silence before the game for 31 people who died in the Paddington rail disaster five days earlier, when 520 people were also injured. The team wore black armbands and paid its respects before we set about beating Belgium 2-1. 

I thought we played OK. I scored a screamer (with my left foot) and, though Keegan bizarrely later claimed to the press he’d been angry with us, I don’t recall that.

He said: ‘It was a great start and you think, “Let’s go and play”, but for the first time I had to get angry with a few players. The two I got into were Redknapp and Lampard. They responded really well so maybe I should get angry again.’

It meant we were back page news in the Daily Mail for the wrong reasons!

Frank enjoyed a glorious international career, winning 106 caps. I have always been proud of him and I hope we will look back on that debut with pride in years to come.

Frank improved with age. He possessed wonderful drive and a hungry appetite. Frank Senior was a huge influence on him and pushed him. His dad could be ferocious at times, but Frank handled that and improved. 

My dad tells stories of him running alone at West Ham’s training ground, where Harry and Frank were the management team, forcing himself to improve his stamina.

It was that stamina, the timing of his runs, his finishing and his power that turned him into a Premier League star.

I look at him now, signing for Manchester City and refusing to accept the time has caught him up, and I admire his determination. He doesn’t care what people think and don’t be surprised if he makes a difference to Manchester City at some point before he heads for New York and his next adventure.

Still going strong: Lampard joined Manchester City this summer following his release from Chelsea 

He has enjoyed a momentous career. It’s the right time for him to retire from international football.

It is 5,435 days since we pulled on the red shirt of England together - 14 years, 10 months, and 17 days - but I remember it like it was on Tuesday.

I was proud to be there at the start and to be writing this tribute at the end.
