True to form, the celebrity lawyer known in legal circles as the 'Diva of Divorce' is not letting a little thing such as being laid up in hospital get in the way of extracting every last penny for her wealthy clients.

Ayesha Vardag has spent this week firing off emails and fielding calls on her mobile phone from her bed in the swanky Lister Hospital in Chelsea.

So what exactly has laid her low? A tummy-tuck operation, she tells me cheerfully between visits from her nurses in her well-appointed private room.

Such cosmetic tweaks, the glamorous 45-year-old Miss Vardag points out, are vital if she is to impress her well-off, mainly female, clients.

'And I do a lot of television,' she adds. 'It's all to do with public image.'

Likewise, she says she wouldn't be seen dead without her vast wardrobe of Dior, Chanel and Donna Karan business suits. And she arrives for meetings at the wheel of a red, open-top classic Mercedes 280SL.

'It's a 1984 model,' she explains. 'I grew up watching Dallas and Pamela Ewing drove one exactly like it. It's the epitome of glamour.'

Suffice to say, the colourful Miss Vardag, who runs her own £10 million-a-year legal firm, is not your average divorce lawyer. No wonder she's causing ructions in the cloistered world of London's top matrimonial solicitors.

Not least because she's gone into battle with the most formidable of adversaries: her former mentor and rival for the role of Britain's top celebrity divorce specialist, Raymond Tooth.

Nicknamed 'Jaws' because of his fearsome reputation, he's won millions for clients who have included Jude Law's ex Sadie Frost, Cheryl Barrymore and Roman Abramovich's former wife, Irina, who he advised during her £1.2 billion split from the Chelsea FC oligarch.

Cigar-chomping Mr Tooth isn't a man you'd want to be on the wrong side of. Yet it's been reported that Miss Vardag has been caught red-handed trying to steal rich and famous clients from under his nose. And it's caused Tooth — who has, until now, always insisted on keeping a low profile — to come out fighting.

'It's a very poor show, I'm afraid,' an angry Tooth told me this week. 'I think it's so underhand, particularly as I helped her in her career — talk about biting the hand that fed you.'

The row has erupted over claims the law firm Miss Vardag owns hijacked the website of Tooth's Mayfair-based partnership Sears Tooth.

Her firm, Vardags, paid for an advertisement on the website Google AdWords which meant anyone using Google to search for Tooth's company was led to a 'puff' for his rival's operation.

Under the logo of Tooth's firm, the advert boasted: 'Vardags is a world-renowned, top family law firm, dealing with many high-profile cases; from celebrities and foreign royals to high net-worth and international individuals.'

Much worse, as far as 73-year-old Tooth is concerned, it implied that he was past it and that Miss Vardag was his heir apparent.

The promotional spiel continued: 'Sharing elements of Ray Tooth's flamboyant and forceful style, Ayesha Vardag has been described by senior members of the profession as the modern successor to the family law “crown”, which Tooth wore through the Eighties and Nineties.'

'Vardags', it added, 'have had a number of clients transfer to them from Sears Tooth.'

No wonder Mr Tooth is incandescent. Miss Vardag claims the whole thing has been a misunderstanding caused by an over-zealous advertising agent. But Tooth insists it's a case of dirty tricks orchestrated by his ambitious former underling.

In response, he hired lawyer Niri Shan of City firm Taylor Wessing to have the advert removed.

Now Vardags have settled the case out of court by agreeing to pay £5,000 in damages and another £38,000 in costs. They've also had to promise not to do it again, although they deny liability.

The row has highlighted a major clash of styles. While the ageing Mr Tooth avoids the limelight, meeting his famous clients late at night to keep their identities secret, the thrusting Miss Vardag boasts openly about her court successes and is a regular face on television, including ITV's This Morning.

Despite the settlement, Tooth does not seem inclined to let bygones be bygones.  

'It was an absolutely naked attempt to get our business,' he told me this week. 'I do not accept that Ayesha Vardag somehow excuses herself and her firm from what happened.

'This whole argument has been about someone behaving in a way where they pinch another person's clients in the most unscrupulous way. And to suggest she didn't know about it is nonsense.'

But Miss Vardag was quick to hit back. In a pointed dig at her former mentor, she insisted: 'We've had most of the high-profile divorces of the past year, so we've got enough to keep us busy without Ray's clients as well. It's always difficult for our competitors when we expand our market share. We've got a very modern way of doing things.'

The fall-out comes as the battle to land Britain's biggest divorce cases turns increasingly hostile.

Newcomer Miss Vardag, the daughter of a single mother, won a place at Cambridge and qualified as a barrister before launching her own firm in 2005.

The divorced mother-of-three divides her time between a rented £7 million Queen Anne-style mansion next door to Winchester Cathedral, a £1.7 million Georgian house she owns in Islington and a stylish farmhouse in southern Italy.

She made her name acting for Katrin Radmacher, the German heiress who won a landmark case in the Supreme Court in 2010 which ruled a pre-nup to protect her £100 million fortune from her French-born ex-husband was legally binding.

She currently represents former Miss Malaysia Pauline Chai, who is seeking £500 million in her divorce from her Laura Ashley-owner husband Khoo Kay Peng.

Against Miss Vardag is the equally flamboyant Tooth, who, like his protegee, charges a reported £500-an-hour. In 2005, after his divorce from second wife Debbie, he bought a £5 million townhouse in Chelsea.

Meanwhile, he's known for being driven around town in a £220,000 navy-blue German-built Maybach limousine, which comes with its own Champagne-stocked bar.

His reputation for being ruthless has brought the Oxford-educated lawyer a host of rich clients. He won £4 million for Sadie Frost in her divorce from Jude Law, plus a £2 million house and £15,000-a-month maintenance. He also helped Eimear Montgomerie walk away from her marriage to golfer Colin with £15 million.

Ironically, Tooth also represented Miss Vardag in her 2000 divorce from fellow lawyer Xavier Hunter, with whom she has two sons Jasper, 18, and Felix, 17 (she also has a daughter Helena, 11, from a later, failed relationship).

But despite his low public profile, Mr Tooth has been touched by controversy on occasion.

In 2011, Stacey Van Rossum, a former filing clerk at his firm took him to an industrial tribunal claiming that when he found out she was pregnant, he offered to 'kick the baby out of her stomach'.

The lawyer, who denied Ms Van Rossum's claims, did admit asking her to scratch his back.

Miss Van Rossum lost the case when it was ruled that she had quit Sears Tooth before she was fired.

Meanwhile, Pattie Boyd wrote in her 2007 memoirs that she decided not to hire Mr Tooth for her divorce from Eric Clapton after visiting the lawyer at his office. She said he 'frightened me so much I thought he was going to have Eric assassinated!'

Former commercial lawyer Miss Vardag joined Tooth Sears in 2001 but left the following year after falling pregnant with her daughter.

Nine years after launching her own firm from a room in her North London home, she employs 50 lawyers and says her firm has had a 300-400 per cent growth rate in recent years.

But Mr Tooth scoffs at her claims that she's secured the majority of big-money clients from under the nose of his firm in recent years.

'It's complete nonsense,' he says. 'Ayesha's a self-confessed publicist. I'm not here to empire-build. I have managed to keep confidential most of my well-known clients because I make a big effort to ensure it doesn't get out.

'Part of Vardags' ethos is to get clients publicity, not realising that the judges do not like it and it hurts their case. But it's all part of her own publicity campaign.

'I don't have personal ill-will, with the exception that I think what she did [with the website] was really underhand.'

However, Miss Vardag is not overly repentant. 'It's one of those unfortunate things,' she says. 'An ad went out without my authority and as soon as we learnt about it, we got it taken down.

'I'm really looking forward to locking horns with Ray again, but only for our clients in the future.'

For the time being, however, who'd be brave enough to take bets on who'll come out on top?
