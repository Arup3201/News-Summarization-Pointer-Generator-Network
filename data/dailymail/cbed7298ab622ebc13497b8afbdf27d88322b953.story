A schoolboy may never be able to smile again after he was shot in the face by a sniper with an airgun.

Jordan Winstanley, 13, was blasted by a gunman hiding in bushes as he walked with friends.

The teenager collapsed to the ground with blood pouring from a hole in his cheek.

Agony: Jordan Winstanley, 13, doubled up in pain after he was hit in the face by the pellet as he walked with friends

He was rushed to hospital and transferred to a specialist facial unit, where he underwent a three-hour operation.

Jordan’s parents have been told by medics that the pellet could have severed key nerves in his left cheek and mouth.

They face an agonising wait to see if the youngster will ever regain his smile.

Mum
Michelle Bleakley, 34, said: ‘We are just keeping our fingers crossed 
that his facial movements will return. There is a chance that the nerves
could be completely severed.

'Jordan could have lost his eye if the
pellet had been two inches higher. It also could have gone through his 
neck. It could have killed him. It was a disgusting attack and 
completely unprovoked.’

Michelle, from Atherton, near Wigan, is calling for a ban on air weapons.

Horror: Jordan needed a three-hour operation after he was shot in the face with an air rifle while playing with friends

Jordan had been walking with two friends on land near to Hall Lee Bank Park in Westhoughton when the sniper struck.

He was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital before being transferred to the unit in Blackburn.

The teenager was finally discharged with 12 stitches both inside and outside his cheek.

The swelling must clear before he can be assessed by surgeons again in two weeks.

Jordan, a pupil at Hindley High, said: ‘I was just walking when I felt a sharp pain. I just remember falling to the ground. My friends told me that I was bleeding and I covered it with my sleeve. The ambulance was there the next minute. It was very scary.’

Jordan’s dad Steve Winstanley, 32, said: ‘The child or adult who has got this air rifle needs to know the danger of what they are doing. Someone out there thinks it’s okay to go around taking pot-shots at people.

‘It’s horrendous. This air rifle needs to be taken off the streets.’

Bolton CID confirmed they had launched an investigation. None of the boys saw the gunman.

Witnesses can call 0161 856 0064 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
