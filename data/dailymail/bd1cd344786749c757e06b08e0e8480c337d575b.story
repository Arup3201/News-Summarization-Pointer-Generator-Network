The headmaster of one of Britain's leading public schools has said the Education Secretary needs to be more radical if she wants to help the have-nots.  

In a piece published yesterday, Sir Anthony Seldon, the headmaster of Wellington College where fees are more than £30,000 a year, also said of Conservative MP Nicky Morgan: 'She came to the job knowing little about schools and with no great interest in education.'

He went on to write: 'Unlike Michael Gove, she is busy nursing a marginal seat. A big ask for anyone, let alone with only nine months in post before a probable departure at the general election.'

Sir Anthony, 61, who has led the co-educational school in Berkshire for eight years, described Mrs Morgan as 'a practising Christian' who 'came to her job believing morality is essential in schools.'

The piece comes after the Education Secretary pledged this week to spend £5million on soldiers visiting schools to teach children about 'grit' and 'determination'.

Mrs Morgan replaced Michael Gove in the Prime Minister's cabinet reshuffle in July.

In a comment piece written for The Times newspaper, Sir Anthony went on to recommend that funds should instead be spent on 'providing the means for all independent schools to sponsor academies'.

Sir Anthony, who is one of Britain's most well-known headmasters, also said that Mrs Morgan should 'charge the well-off too for places at top state schools'.

He added that a quarter of places at independent and top state schools should be kept for children from deprived backgrounds.

Sir Anthony was knighted in June for services to education after he introduced his own curriculum, which includes lessons in happiness at the £33,000 a year co-educational school.

Sir Anthony is headmaster of  Wellington College, Berkshire (above), where annual fees are more than £30,000

He also founded Wellington Academy in 2009 with the aim of providing 'quality education to people who can't afford to pay fees'.

In the piece, Sir Anthony expressed a concern that Britain is 'heading into the 2015 election with none of the three major political parties having any serious policies to tackle the deep social divide in Britain's education'.

In a foreboding warning to the Government, he wrote: 'We will never see social mobility rise in Britain until young people from disadvantaged backgrounds acquire the confidence and character skills of independent school leavers.'

He called for Mrs Morgan and Tristram Hunt, the Shadow Education Secretary, to 'embrace radical solutions if we are to make any progress'.
