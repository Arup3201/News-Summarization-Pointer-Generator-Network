The latest figures from the OEDC back George Osborne's economic plan, showing 100,000 jobs are being added every month

George Osborne yesterday received a boost from a respected international watchdog, which declared he was right to stick to his economic plan.

The Chancellor’s strategy was backed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as a separate report said that firms are taking on about 100,000 staff a month.

The figure from research group Markit – which equates to about 3,300 workers a day or 1.2million a year – would push employment to a record high of more than 31.5million by the General Election in May next year.

The OECD said it expects output in the UK to grow by 3.2 per cent this year – up from the 2.4 per cent predicted in November. That is faster than any country in the Group of Seven major industrialised nations.

Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD, said the recovery will continue to build. In a blow to Labour, he added:

‘There were millions of voices rising in the UK saying change course. In the end the British Government was proven right.’

Mr Osborne said the latest forecasts were ‘a real vote of confidence in the UK’s long term economic plan’ but warned that risks remain.

‘Britain is coming back and our long term economic plan is working,’ a Treasury spokesman said. ‘But we can’t take the recovery for granted.

‘The impact of the Great Recession is still being felt, but the foundations for a broad based recovery are now in place.

The biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the  plan that is laying those foundations.’

The report is a further blow to Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who have consistently criticised the Chancellor’s austerity plans only to see the recovery take off.

Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, welcomed ‘a growing tide of better economic news for the UK and a growing headache for the Labour Party and their narrative on the economy’.

Labour has put the ‘cost of living crisis’ at the heart of its economic message. But with inflation now at 1.6 per cent, its lowest level for nearly five years, and wages picking up, the squeeze on family finances looks to be coming to an end.

Ministers welcomed the OECD’s prediction that business investment will pick up this year, making the recovery far less reliant on the housing market and consumer spending.

Mr Alexander said: ‘I have always said that strong business investment is a pre-requisite for a sustainable and balanced recovery.

'That business investment should be further helped by the forecast that the UK will be the fastest growing G7 economy in 2014.

‘There is still more to do but the improving economic outlook is undoubtedly a great help to families and businesses across the country.’

Kevin Daly, an economist at Goldman Sachs, predicted that wages in the private sector will be rising by more than 3 per cent by the end of the year compared with just over 1 per cent now.

‘Pay growth is likely to rise over the coming 12 months,’ he said.

Michael Saunders, a London-based economist at global banking giant Citi, added: ‘All the signs are that Britain is booming.’

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘The UK economic recovery shows no signs of running out of steam. With the outlook brightening, the pace of job creation hit a record high.’
