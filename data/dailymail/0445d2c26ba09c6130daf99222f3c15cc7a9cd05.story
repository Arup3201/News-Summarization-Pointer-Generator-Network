Google Now has added an alarm feature (pictured) that automatically calculates when a user needs to alight public transport

Most people have fallen asleep on a train or bus after a long day at work or a party, only to find they have missed their stop and face a hefty taxi fare home.

But a new feature on Google Now could put an end to such misery and enable people to take a nap without worrying about the consequences.

Google has added an alarm to its service that already voluntarily offers people information about the weather, their journey and upcoming appointments.

And the new system means the service can now automatically calculate when to set an alarm based on saved locations such as home and work, plus public transport information, Android Police reported.

The alarm ‘knows’ how long the journey should last and when the users should get off the bus or train.

By tapping the screen, the alarm will wake them  up in time for their stop. and save a long walk home or that costly taxi ride.

The
 service is only available in select areas where transport information is available, and works for users of Android
 smartphones and tablets as well as iPhones and iPads.

This update follows the release of public transports routes across the UK last month.

Google updated its Maps service to include an extra 17,000 public transport routes nationally.

The app sums up activity, such as how far the user has walked.

It checks traffic ahead of any appointments they have in their phone's calendar.

It reminds them about restaurant reservations, events and birthdays. 

The alarm feature stops users missing their bus or train stop.

The app can suggest destinations they might like, suggest photo spots and translate languages.

National rail data and public transport information is already available on Google Maps in cities, including London, but this latest update extended it to the rest of the country.

Google Maps for Public Transport now features route details for buses, trains, tubes, trams and ferries.

It shows real-time departures and reveals how many interchanges there will be.

For each journey, the app compares all the available routes via the different transport modes, including walking and driving, to see which is the quickest or easiest.
