Australian teenage jihadist Jake Bilardi was expressing anti-Western sentiments years before he fled to the Middle East 

Australian teenage jihadist Jake Bilardi was expressing anti-Western sentiments years before he fled to the Middle East to fight with terror group Islamic State. 

In comments posted about news stories and opinion pieces, Bilardi pointed out the evils of Australia and the United States.

Earlier this week, Fairfax Media revealed a 'Jonathan Edwards', who was thought to be a Briton when he appeared in a photo brandishing a rifle between two bearded men in front of a black IS flag last year, was in fact an 18-year-old from Melbourne.

Bilardi is a high school drop-out who attended Craigieburn Secondary College - in the Victorian capital's north. 

A collection of his comments seen on the website, Disqus, showed the teenager was an avid reader of Al Jazeera.

They date back up to four years ago and most of them showed him weighing in on Islamic issues.

In response to another commenter, Bilardi tells them to 'get a better education on the real teachings of Islam' before airing their opinion in May 2011.

'I am not a muslim [sic] but you see I am not a pathetic loser who doesn't know anything outside of their own home and I actually have a life I don't just go on the internet to abuse people and their beliefs,' the 18-year-old wrote.

This came a year before the teenager, who has been dubbed the 'White Jihadist', converted to Islam and started worshipping at Melbourne mosques, according to Fairfax Media.

Later in the year, Bilardi hit out at an American who he accused of Islamophobic behaviour.

'The CIA funded Al-Qaeda, the US government funded the Taliban. They brought this on themselves. You are a prime example of an Islamophobe,' Bilardi said.

'Saying "maybe if Muslims didn't attack America", you do realise that less than 1% of Muslims are terrorists and that Islamic terrorism only makes up 6% of global terrorism.'

Bilardi added Americans were being influenced by local media, saying the same happened to Australians.

'If you're smart enough and can think for yourself you can actually realise that most of the stuff you are told are lies,' he said. 

Earlier this week,  a youthful Islamic State fighter posing with a rifle was identified as Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi

Jake Bilardi's aunt said the entire family was devastated by her 18-year-old nephew joining ISIS

A Craigieburn schoolmate was shocked because Bilardi 'really kept to himself and didn't cause trouble'

'America is supposed to be a land of freedom, but... the CIA can listen in on phone calls from anyone in the country, cameras have been set up on every street, people have been arrested just for being Muslim, just shows what scum are running the country.'

The teenager was an avid reader of Al Jazeera and weighed in on Islamic issues in the comments section 

Bilardi also accused American soldiers of 'always killing innocent civilians' in Afghanistan and Iraq, saying they were bombing and shooting them 'just for fun'.

'They are sick twisted mental patients who don't deserve to be allowed outside ever again,' he wrote.

'Then everyone gets angry when another boat full of Asylum Seekers comes into Australian waters.

'They are not only fleeing the brutality of militias and the Taliban, they are also fleeing the brutality of the Western forces.'

These comment emerge as the family of Bilardi reveal they are devastated by revelations he is now fighting with the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Iraq.

Speaking outside her Melbourne home, Bilardi's aunt said they were struggling with the news the skinny 18-year-old had joined the terrorist organisation and had issued threats against his homeland.

She was joined by former schoolmates, who are still in shock at the teenager's transformation from awkward teenager to radical, gun-totting terrorist. 

‘How are we supposed to feel? It is devastating, just devastating,’ Bilardi's aunt told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I mean, it’s my brother’s son, you are talking about.' 

Bilardi's aunt said the family feels like they are being harassed as a result of her nephew's radical move

Asked how the young man's father was coping with the news and his auntie's emotional response was: ‘well, he’s not’.

‘We feel like we are being harassed because of this. It’s not about me, it’s my brother’s son.' 

Bilardi's former schoolmates at Craigieburn Secondary College also described their shock at describing the awkward's teen conversion to terrorism. 

A schoolmate, who asked not to be named, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Mate, I’m shocked at what he’s done.

‘No one at school saw this coming, we can’t believe it, he was quiet, really kept to himself and didn't cause trouble there - our parents are upset too.'

In a series of tweets around Christmas time, Bilardi purportedly threatened more attacks following the Martin Place siege

In this message, Bilardi is referring to a call by an Islamic State religious leaders to commit graphic crimes against Americans, Frenchmen or their allies, including Australians

Neighbours too have been caught by surprise, with one admitting that ‘I had no idea that sort of thing could happen, not here – it’s terribly sad but I’ll keep my eyes open from now on, that’s for sure’.

The 18-year-old sent a series of sick tweets to federal police gloating about future terror attacks on Australia.

In one of the messages, Bilardi threatened that the Sydney Lindt café siege was ‘just the beginning for your dogs’.

Bilardi described himself as a 'revert' to Islam who was 'tall, white, skinny, long hair'

In August, Bilardi reported that he had arrived in the Iraqi city of Ramadi after 'making jihra' (or departing)

The tweets, which were first revealed by Daily Mail Australia in December, also showed he was considering returning home to follow an Islamic State leader’s order to kill disbelievers, including Australians, by any means possible.

‘That’s twice now I’ve seriously considered coming back and following Sheikh Adnani’s fatwa in Australia,’ he wrote.

In October, al-Adnani released an audio message where he implored his followers to commit graphic crimes against 'disbelieving American (sic), Frenchman or any of their allies. 

'Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,' al-Adnani said.

And in another Twitter message, reportedly written this week, he said he would another attack would 'make 9/11 look like child's play.'
