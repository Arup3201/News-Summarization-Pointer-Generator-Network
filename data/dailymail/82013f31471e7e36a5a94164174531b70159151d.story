Mr Landale said today: 'Hello, and 
good morning. It would of course be a much better morning if Andrew were
 here and not me, but I'm keeping the chair warm while he is away 
getting better.

'We all look forward to his speedy recovery and wish him and his family well and all the best in the meantime.'

Mr Miliband, a guest on show today, 
added: ‘On behalf of myself and everybody across politics I wish Andrew 
Marr a speedy recovery, all best wishes to him and his family.’

Mr Marr, who began his career as a 
newspaper reporter, became the editor of The Independent before turning 
to TV. He has also presented history programmes and has had five books 
published.

BBC Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine and 
newsreader Sophie Raworth are expected to provide cover for the 
following two weeks.

Last week a BBC spokesman said Mr Marr was 
‘conscious and eating’.

The first few days after a stroke can 
be critical, and there were worries that his condition may fluctuate. 
Sources confirmed there had been concern - but he was showing positive 
signs.

Colleagues were left stunned and 
concerned when the BBC revealed Mr Marr's illness. It is understood that his family are with him at hospital.

An insider, who said there were 'a lot
 of shocked people at Broadcasting House', admitted it was too soon to 
say what the long-term implications would be for the broadcaster’s 
health and career.

The BBC confirmed that Mr Marr will be
 out of action for the rest of the month, having lined up guest host Mr 
Vine to present the show on January 20 and Ms Raworth on January 27.

He is known to be a fitness fanatic 
and takes regular exercise wherever he is filming. He is a keen runner 
and always abstains from alcohol during January.

Mr Marr and his wife, journalist 
Jackie Ashley, have been married for 25 years and have a son and two 
daughters. Mr Marr is an acclaimed journalist, broadcaster and author.

He wrote and presented his own History
 of Modern Britain and The Making of Modern Britain for BBC2, which were
 hugely popular with viewers and won prestigious awards.

His more recent offerings include the 
Diamond Queen documentary and his most recent show, History of the World
 was broadcast on BBC1 before Christmas. A book accompanies the series.

Born in Glasgow, Mr Marr went to school in Scotland and gained a first-class degree in English from  Cambridge University.

He began his career in journalism on 
The Scotsman newspaper in 1981, later moving to London to become its 
political correspondent.

Mr Marr was part of the team which 
launched The Independent in 1986 and returned as its editor, after a 
stint at The Economist magazine.

He was then a columnist for The 
Express and The Observer before making the move into television, as the 
BBC's political editor, in May 2000.

He has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published.

In May 2011 it emerged that he had taken out a super-injunction to prevent the reporting of an affair.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured here in December last year, is due to appear on Mr Marr's show soon

He won a High Court order in January 
2008 to silence the press following his extra-marital affair with 
another national newspaper reporter.

He admitted he had taken the step as he said he felt 'uneasy' about it as a journalist.

The woman with whom he had the affair 
is a political journalist who has a daughter. Since their fling, some 
nine years ago, her name has appeared widely online.

Mr Marr is considered young to have 
suffered a stroke, as the vast majority of the 150,000 people who suffer
 the attack every year in England are over 65.

According to NHS figures, in England, 
strokes are a major health problem, and are the third largest cause of 
death, after heart disease and cancer.

The brain damage caused by strokes 
means that they are the largest cause of adult disability in the UK, but
 it also possible to make a full recovery.
