They're the bane of A-listers everywhere thanks to their long lenses and gift for catching a celebrity during moments they would rather the public didn't see but the origin of the paparazzi are more glamorous than the modern incarnation would suggest.

Now a new exhibition is to turn the lens on some of the first paparazzo, who documented the golden age of Italian cinema, provoking outrage from their A-list subjects and adoration from the public who devoured their work.

But it's not all Bieber-style paparazzi dust-ups: The 80 photos set to go on display at the Estorick Collection from 30th April also offer a glimpse of the dolce vita or 'sweet life' enjoyed by Italian movie stars and Hollywood royalty working in Rome during the 1950s and '60s.

The two decades were a golden era in Italian film when directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Federico Fellini produced some of their most famous films, including the latter’s iconic La Dolce Vita (1960).

So successful was the Italian film making industry, Hollywood stars such as John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Lauren Bacall and Liz Taylor flocked to Rome, along with directors lured by the comparatively inexpensive Cinecittà studios.

In the Roman studios, some of the biggest films of the age, among them Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963) were shot. 

In the evenings, however, a different type of camera lens took over, with photojournalists with an eye on the bottom line unable to resist the lure of the A-lister packed bars and restaurants that lined the city’s exclusive Via Veneto.

One of the most skillful was Marcello Geppetti, whose photos vividly evoke an era of extraordinary glamour, creativity and decadence.

Geppetti, who died in 1998, eventually amassed an archive of more than a million images, many featuring period heavyweights such as Brigitte Bardot, Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn.

And Geppetti was unique in another way too, making the decision early in his career to sell his work to press agencies rather than direct to papers in much the same way that paparazzi do today.

Initially, he was employed by the Meldolesi-Canestrelli-Bozzer agency, then one of the most high-profile of its kind, where he earned a a reputation both for the technical quality of his images and his talent for capturing dramatic, eye-catching moments, before going freelance. 

Ironically, Geppetti made his name with harrowing images of a fire at the Hotel Ambasciatori on Via Veneto: the very street that would later provide him with arresting imagery of a quite different nature, as he travelled along it on his scooter on the lookout for celebrities.

Many capture moments when, as he put it, 'the ordinary coexisted with the extraordinary’, as in his image of Liz Taylor wandering with a friend through the streets of Cinecittà dressed as Cleopatra, or the actor Mickey Hargitay riding down the Via Veneto on horseback. 

One of his most famous shots is that of Richard Burton kissing Liz Taylor while holidaying in Ischia, a photograph recently listed among the 30 most famous images in history, alongside works by Andy Warhol and Cecil Beaton.

Yet despite the loveliness of his work, the celebrities he photographed considered the behaviour of the paparazzi as intrusive then as they do today.

Romance: Jane Mansfield and Mike Hargitay leaving Piccola Budapest, Rome, October 1962

Attack: Like Bieber, Franco Nero, seen here hitting Rino Barillari at the Trevi Fountain, was no fan of the paps

One photograph captures the actor Franco Nero in the act of assaulting Geppetti’s fellow paparazzo, Rino Barillari, at the Trevi Fountain, while another series of images show Anita Ekberg in her stockinged feet confronting another paparazzo with a bow and arrow before attacking him with her fists.

While the A-listers they followed loathed them, Geppetti and his ilk produced some of the most iconic images of the 1950s; cementing Hollywood's place in popular culture in the process.

Love them or loathe them, there's no denying that the paparazzo - and the public who adored them - changed the face of photojournalism forever.

The Years of La Dolce Vita begins on the 30th April and runs until the 29th June at the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art. For more information, see estorickcollection.com
