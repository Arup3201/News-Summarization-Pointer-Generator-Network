Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has offered to cover the cost of life imprisonment for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan if Indonesia agrees to call of their executions. 

Ms Bishop made the offer in a letter written to her Indonesian counterpart, Retno Marsudi, on March 5 saying Australia would pay the bill if the country rejected a prisoner swap offer. 

The letter, reportedly addressed 'My dear Retno', formally made the one-off offer to swap three convicted Indonesian drug smugglers for Chan and Sukumaran.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has offered to cover the cost of life imprisonment for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan if Indonesia agrees to call of their executions

Ms Bishop (pictured at a vigil for the two Bali Nine ringleaders in Canberra) made the offer in a letter written to her Indonesian counterpart, Retno Marsudi, on March 5

Ms Bishop noted the Indonesian prisoners were convicted of importing 390kg of heroin to Australia - 47 times the amount Chan and Sukumaran's co-convicted were caught trying to smuggle out of Indonesia.

'As discussed, the Australian Government would be prepared to cover the costs of the ongoing life imprisonment of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran should a transfer not be possible,' she wrote.

'The vast majority of Australians very strongly support the government's efforts to seek clemency for Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran.

'We would not want to see their execution compromise the strong ties we have worked so hard to foster over many years.' 

Ms Marsudi, in a letter of reply dated March 8, rejected the possibility of a prisoner exchange but did not touch on the reimbursement offer.

'Let me reiterate that there is no legal basis within the Indonesian law that would allow for such exchange to take place,' she said.

The letter, reportedly addressed 'My dear Retno', formally made the one-off offer to swap three convicted Indonesian drug smugglers for Chan (pictured) and Sukumaran 

Indonesian President Joko Widodo previously ruled out a prisoner swap arrangement.

Ms Bishop also listed alleged corruption from judges in the trial as one of the reasons their executions should be stopped, according to the West Australian. 

'A Judicial Commission has invited Mr Chan, Mr Sukumaran and their original lawyer to make statements in a matter relating to alleged corruption of the trial judges,' she wrote.

'These are serious allegations and I request that your Government accord due legal process and institute a pause in the execution preparations.' 

Diplomatic tension has been high regarding the case with an Indonesian minister threatening to release a 'human tsunami' of asylum seekers towards Australia if the government continued to fight for a stay of execution for the Bali Nine duo.

The warning came from the coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs -Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno - to remind the government who was working to keep asylum seekers away from Australian shores, according to Fairfax Media.

It comes after Indonesian government officials took offence to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments about Australia donating $1 billion in aid to help recovery after the Boxing Day tsunami along with threatening to discourage visitors to Bali. 

The Bali Nine ringleaders are in quarantine conditions on Nusakambangan island off Java awaiting execution, with their lawyers returning next week after their appeal hearing was adjourned.

The men's Australian lawyer, Peter Morrissey, described Ms Bishop's offer as attractive but raised doubts about whether Indonesian authorities would take it up.

'Whether that on its own will do the trick, I doubt,' Mr Morrissey told the Seven Network.

'I think Indonesia will consider the whole range of things that Julie Bishop and Tony Abbott have put forward.'

Meanwhile, Australia's most senior Muslim leader has flown to Jakarta to make a personal plea for mercy for the duo.

The Grand Mufti of Australia Ibrahim Abu Mohammed told Indonesian leaders forgiveness lay at the heart of Islam, and touched on the 'heritage of mercy' in their shared religion. 

Virgin founder Richard Branson also wrote a heartfelt letter to Indonesian President Joko Widodo pleading for him to save the lives of those facing the death penalty.

The British businessman, who's also a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, said he was willing to go to Indonesia in an effort to save those facing execution.
