A man who tried to dodge a speeding ticket by blaming an imaginary Mexican friend has escaped jail.

Michael Tatem told police that Carlos De La Vega was in the driver's seat of his Alfa Romeo when he was clocked by a mobile speed unit doing 53mph in 40mph in Plymouth, Devon.

He even went as far as to try and fool 
officers with an address for his fake acquaintance - which turned out to
be a bunker in Mexico.

Blame: This is the moment a police traffic unit clocked Michael Tatem's Alfa Romeo speeding in Plymouth. He told officers his Mexican friend Carlos De La Vega was behind the wheel

Throughout a lengthy investigation, Tatem failed to provide any evidence to prove his friend existed.

The 64-year-old eventually confessed that he was behind the wheel of the white Giulietta in January last year, but only after insisting that Mr De La Vega was a real friend he knew from London.

During his trial at Plymouth Crown Court,
David Gittins, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'Despite all 
attempts by police to establish if this man existed, Mr Tatem never 
provided any details to show the existence of this man.'

Caught out: Michael Tatem eventually admitted he was driving, after trying to convince police his acquaintance existed

Tatem was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years, for making a false statement. He has also been ordered to pay £1,000 compensation and an £80 victim surcharge.

Inspector Richard Pryce of Devon and Cornwall Police, who led the investigation into Tatem's claims, said: 'We treat these offences very seriously indeed.'

Police revealed that Tatem was one of 40 speed cheats prosecuted in Devon and Cornwall for attempting to pervert the course of justice by claiming someone else was driving.
