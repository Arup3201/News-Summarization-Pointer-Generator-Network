A mother-of-13 accused of offering a hit man up to $10,000 to murder her husband wanted the crime committed in fall to make it look like a hunting accident, a court heard on Thursday.

Wendy Farley, 48, faces up to 30 years in prison if she is found guilty of soliciting the murder of husband Luther 'Rusty' Farley, 53, in 2012.

The Piscataquis county court in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, heard an alleged secret tape of Farley asking cab driver Michael Anderson to shoot her husband once in the head while he was out chopping wood so that his death could be disguised as a hunting accident.

Michael Anderson, 51, testified on Thursday that he met Mrs Farley, of Brownville, at a gig at a restaurant in Milo in early September 2012.

Mr Anderson said that the logger's wife was specific about the details of the contract killing of her husband of 30 years.

She wanted a .30-.30 rifle used and offered $1,000 cash up front with the rest coming later, the Bangor Daily News reported.

Mr Anderson told the court: 'I thought she was 
blowing off steam, but the second time she brought it up, I realized she
 was focused [on it].

'A chill went through me. I knew the lady was serious, and that that man was going to die.'

Mr Anderson, who denied his nickname was 'Mafia Mike' but admitted that some people called him that, went to local police about Farley's claims.

He agreed to record a conversation with Farley on September 18, 2012, with a wiretap hidden in his boot.

Suspect: Farley, 46, was charged with trying to hire a hit man to kill her husband and father of her 13 children

On the recording, Farley can allegedly be heard saying that she wanted 'nothing fancy, nothing stupid, nothing traceable'.  

'A straight hit, that's what I want,' the woman was allegedly recorded saying. 'One shot - drop him.'

'Rusty' Farley is believed to have been the intended victim of his wife's murder-for-hire plot

When Mr Anderson asked if her husband was abusive, she denied that he was but said she wanted to be free of his strictness and obsession with cleanliness.

She added: 'He's out, he's gone, I'm free. Kids can grow up unafraid to be kids.'

She said that she had been thinking about killing him for several years. 

Farley admitted to police that she had cheated on her husband with 
other men and used the Internet to research ways to poison him.  

The
 mother-of-13 has been free on $10,000 cash bail since November 2012. 
Farley is banned from having any contact with her husband 
but she is permitted to see her younger children.

The couple is separated, according to her defense attorney Peter Rodway.

The trial is expected to conclude today.
