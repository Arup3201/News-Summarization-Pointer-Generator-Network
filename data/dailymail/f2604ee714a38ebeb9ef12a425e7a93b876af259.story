Three members of the same family have been killed in a fatal crash between a four-wheel-drive and a truck.

Michael Camporeale and his two sons Lee and James Camporeale, lost their lives in the head-on collision at Cultana, halfway between Whyalla and Port Augusta in South Australia.

The three Port Pirie men, who are builders by trade, were travelling in a Nissan station wagon heading north on the Lincoln Highway.

Police were called at 4.30pm yesterday to the devastating scene after the Nissan station wagon collided head-on with a semi-trailer travelling in the opposite direction.
