Rows about money during the recession triggered a rise in divorces, new figures suggested today.

Money worries, the threat of redundancy and cutting back on life’s luxuries lead to more relationships breaking up.

Divorce rates had been falling in the years since 2004, but as the economy emerged from recession in 2009 there was a surge in couples heading to the courts.

In 2010 the number of marital break-ups rose by 4.9 per cent, before levelling off.

In 2011, 117,558 couples decided to go their separate ways and this rose to 118,140 in 2012.

The Office for National Statistics today linked the rise to fall-out of the 2008-09 recession.

‘One
 theory suggests that recession could contribute to a rise in 
partnership break-ups because of increased financial strain, changes in 
employment and related lifestyle changes,’ the ONS said.

‘Social
 research in Britain has shown that unemployment and downturns in the 
housing market may be associated with family instability.’

There were 13 divorces an hour in England and Wales in 2012

Almost half of these divorces occurred in the first 10 years of marriage. The statistics also show a rise in double-divorcees.

In 1980 just one in ten men and women who divorced also had their previous marriage end in divorce.

This figure rose to almost one in five by 2012, the ONS said.

Some
 people may also choose to divorce during an economic downturn because 
they think they will get a more favourable divorce settlement if their 
income is currently low.

There is a conflicting theory that an 
‘unfavourable economic climate’ can lead to an increase in family 
solidarity during difficult times, with people postponing marital 
break-ups until the economy, and the value of their home improves.

The ONS suggested that ‘recession is associated with an increased risk of divorce, but with a delayed impact’.

‘This
 perhaps reflects a couple’s wait for an economic recovery to lift the 
value of their assets or the time lag between separation and obtaining a
 decree absolute.’

A similar
 trend was seen after the 1990-92 recession, when divorce rates 
increased more markedly in 1993 than during the recession itself. 
Estimates suggest that 42 per cent of marriages end in divorce, the 
report states.

The ONS said a third of marriages are expected to end in divorce before the couple reach their 20th wedding anniversary.

And the average marriage is expected to last for 32 years.

In 2012, the median length of time that couples stayed married before officially separating was 11 and a half years.

Family Justice Minister Simon Hughes said: 'Mediation works.  We are committed to making sure that more people make use of it rather than go through the confrontational and stressful experience of going to court.

'These figures show thousands of people are sadly still divorcing each year. We want them to do it in the least damaging way for everyone involved, especially children.

'That is why we want them to use the excellent mediation services available to agree a way forward, rather than have one forced upon them.'

In 2012 divorce rates among men aged over 50 and women over 45 were higher than a decade earlier.

The average age of men getting a divorce is now 44.7 years and for women 42.2 years.

In 2012, 9,703 men and 6,026 women aged over 60 got divorced.

The ONS said: 'The mean age at divorce generally declined for both males and females during the mid to late 1970s and generally remained stable in the early 1980s.

'Since 1985 the mean ages at divorce for men and women have increased, rising by 7.3 years for both men and women.

'This trend is consistent with increases in the mean age at marriage.

'The difference between the mean age of husband and wife at divorce has remained relatively unchanged over the last four decades, with a difference of around 2.5 years except for the years 1974 to 1976 when it was 2.0 years.'

Marilyn Stowe, the senior partner at Stowe Family Law, said: ‘I believe the economic situation, with the UK falling in and out of recession, has played a key role: a greater number of businesses go into liquidation when a country emerges from recession, and in my experience this principle applies to marriages too.

‘Couples will struggle through times of adversity as best they can, but eventually find that despite their best efforts, they simply can't go on any longer.’

Almost 16,000 marriages ended in 2012 because of adultery.

In 2012, the mean age of a divorcee was 44.7 for men and 42.2 for women.

The ONS said that the mean age for divorce has been steadily rising since the mid-1980s, coinciding with a rise in the age at which people wed.

Provisional marriage statistics suggest that in 2011 the average age for men to marry was 36.3 and 33.8 for women.

Vicki McLynn, partner at law firm Pannone, added: 'The fact that there has been a slight increase could be attributed to couples believing that they can finally afford to divorce now the recession appears to be coming an end.

'Commonly, they feel that in a healthier economy, they may be more likely to find jobs and financial security to sustain them after they separate.'

Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of relationship charity Relate, said: 'We are saddened by the news that the number of divorces has risen slightly in 2012, especially as they had been in decline for the past few years.

'What matters to us is the quality of a relationship, rather than status. Ultimately, people's happiness and wellbeing is of paramount importance and strong couple relationships are proven to be an important part of that.'
