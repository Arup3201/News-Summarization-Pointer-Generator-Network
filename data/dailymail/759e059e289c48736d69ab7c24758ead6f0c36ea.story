It is 3am on Wednesday, September 10. Outside the private terminal of Birmingham airport, a fleet of cars are waiting to take England’s weary Under-21 squad home.

Their four-hour flight back from the Moldovan capital Chisinau has just touched down, bringing an end to a tiring six day tour of Eastern Europe, and as the players file through the small arrivals building, thoughts are centred around climbing back into their own beds.

But as Gareth Southgate’s squad enter the car park, something spontaneous happens. One by one, the players begin to form a group, focusing back on the door they have just come through, to make sure none of their team-mates have been left behind. Nobody wants to speed off.

Once they are all together, hugs and high fives are exchanged; they wish each other good luck for the games they will face at the weekend and make promises to call each other. Nobody is left out of this bonding moment before the convoy of disperses to different parts of the country.

To watch the scene unfold is fascinating. Such camaraderie is something you would expect from a club team, not an international squad, but the environment Southgate has created over the last 14 months has allowed this chemistry to build and means these young players are ready for anything.

‘It is special, this team spirit we have, and I think the players will look back on this and realise it was special,’ says Southgate. ‘I remember Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand saying how close they were as a team in the Under-21s under Peter Taylor, but I think there is a special bond around now.

‘It gives you a real chance as it transmits itself on to the pitch,’ says England U21 manager Southgate

‘They are really close. They all mix with each other and it is quite unique. I come down in the mornings and individuals will be sitting with one person one day and another the next at the breakfast table. The interaction is brilliant and I believe it is very powerful.’

It is also significantly different to how it was for the last Under-21 group that went to the European Championships in Israel 18 months ago. Back then, Stuart Pearce had a number of individuals whose presence was disruptive, distracting and detrimental to England’s ability to progress.

Southgate, however, picks his squad as much on character as he does talent and being blessed with skill alone will no longer secure a player England recognition. If the balance in the dressing room is right, the potential to win is enhanced. 

‘It gives you a real chance as it transmits itself on to the pitch,’ Southgate continued. ‘We have carefully selected players who buy into it and if it gets tough these are the intangibles that help you get results. The desire to run that extra five yards for your mate to get a block in that stops a shot.’

The willingness to chase lost causes, to fight and battle, was evident in Wolverhampton on Friday night, as England put themselves on the brink of qualifying for Euro2015, and those qualities will be essential on Tuesday when battle resumes with Croatia in Vinkovci.

England have a 2-1 advantage to protect from the first leg but they can expect to be challenged like never before. Croatia will be physical, intimidating and will look to bully Southgate’s players; the crowd, meanwhile, will be partisan, the atmosphere hostile.

‘It’s just about nailing everything down,’ said England captain Jack Butland. ‘If we don’t win, we miss out on a major tournament. Who knows what’s going to happen out there? They’re not going to make it easy for us. So any way I can help or any experience I can pass on, I will.’

England have a 2-1 advantage to protect from the first leg but they can definitely expect to be challenged

This, more than anything, will be a test of their mental strength as much as their footballing aptitude but it is an examination England must pass. Southgate is adamant the talent pool of young players in this country is deep but he is aware only positive results will convince a sceptical public.

‘We have to play football but we have got to be prepared for what they will throw at us,’ said Southgate. ‘I don’t suppose Croatia will come at us from the first minute as they know 1-0 will be enough but I believe we will go there and score.

‘It would have been easy for them to panic when they went behind on Friday. We have got brave players. I never see them duck out of challenges. In order to progress, they need to handle these games. They handled it on Friday and they have to show they can handle it again.’
