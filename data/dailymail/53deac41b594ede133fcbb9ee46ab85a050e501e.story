French journalists at the White House have been accused of behaving like they are 'on a school trip' after taking selfies in the Oval Office.

The Gallic reporters have been posting the pictures on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.

France's media corps are in Washington DC to cover President Francois Hollande's state visit to the U.S. to meet Barack Obama.

'Behaving like they it's a school trip': French journalist Thomas Wieder posted this selfie inside the White House which shows Presidents Francois Hollande and Barack Obama in the background

But the starstruck news pack have been annoying White House staff by constantly posing for pictures to impress their friends at home.

Le Monde reporter Thomas Wieder even took one selfie in the Oval office which shows Mr Obama and Mr Hollande in the background.

He posted the photo on Twitter, along with a second one of himself standing behind the famous podium in the White House briefing room.

Wieder wrote beneath the picture: 'Ok guys, I've changed jobs. White House spokesman. I couldn't turn it down.'

Excitable: Mr Weider also posted this picture of himself standing behind the famous podium in the White House briefing room with a saying 'I've changed jobs. I couldn't turn it down'

Reporter Apolline de Malherbe also posed behind the podium with the caption, 'Guys, I miss you!!!'

But French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur described the posed photos as 'embarrassing'.

It wrote: 'French journalists are behaving like they are on a school trip to the White House.

'They have taken selfies in the Oval Office and around the building, and their behaviour has vexed and puzzled their hosts.'

Say cheese! President Obama made his own headlines in December when he posed for this selfie with Prime Minister David Cameron and Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's memorial

France's Canal+ television journalist Laurence Haim said her colleagues were being 'immature'.

She added on Twitter: 'White House advisers do not appreciate all the selfies being taken by French journalists in the Oval Office. It's not the done thing.'

America's Nine MSN news said White House staff had now issued 'a reprimand' to French reporters and asked them to stop taking pictures of themselves.

Obama himself is no stranger to the selfie photographic phenomenon.

The U.S. president made his own headlines in December when he was caught on camera posing for a picture with Prime Minister David Cameron and Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt at the memorial service for former South African president Nelson Mandela.
