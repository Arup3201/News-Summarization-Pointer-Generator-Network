David Cameron’s insistence that he is doing all he can for the squeezed middle classes and old-age pensioners during the recession has been given short shrift by the nation’s most glamorous OAP, Joan Collins.

Joan, 79, a somewhat unlikely champion of the downtrodden, has unexpectedly taken to the barricades on behalf of those much less well-off than herself.

Lamenting the plight of the pensioners, Joan, who switched her allegiance from UKIP to the Tories seven years ago declares: 'I think it’s very hard today for laymen to know what to do with any small money they have.

Woman of the people: Glamorous OAP Joan Collins has come out in support of pensioners and the recession-hit middle classes

‘I find it tragic that people now who are turning 65 and getting their pensions are realising that if they put aside £100,000 over their lifetime they would have received £12,000 [a year] a decade ago.

'Now, that figure has been halved because of the downturn. I don’t see how they can possibly live on that and I think what is happening to the average person in terms of money is quite horrific.’

Joan, best remembered for playing the scheming businesswoman Alexis in Dynasty, remains a UK resident with fifth husband Percy Gibson, despite having homes in the South of France and California.

Joan declares her empathy for the less fortunate in the online magazine of exclusive private bank Coutts, whose clients include the Queen.

Ms Collins states: ‘A hardworking couple 
with two children, a mortgage and a small car are taxed outrageously 
whereas a lot of people who do nothing - and come from families who have
done nothing for two, three or sometimes four generations - receive a 
lot of money in benefits from the Government to continue to do nothing.

Handbags at dawn: Last month Collins caused grief for Home 
Secretary Theresa May, tweeting from Heathrow Airport about thousands 
queuing at passport control

'It seems terribly unfair to me. It’s Middle England who are really hurting, not the rich.’

It is not the first time that Joan has embarrassed  the Government.

Last month, she caused grief for Home Secretary Theresa May, tweeting from Heathrow Airport about thousands queuing at passport control and calling for more immigration staff.
