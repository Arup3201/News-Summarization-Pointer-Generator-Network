A tiny piglet had to be saved from the waves after it escaped onto a beach and swam 150 yards out to sea.

The RSPCA was called after the baby pig became stuck at the top of a cliff above Covehithe beach in Suffolk.

By the time officers arrived, the three-week old animal had tumbled down to the beach and, when rescuers approached, made a dash into the waves.

Saved his bacon: A tiny piglet had to be saved from the waves by RSPCA inspector Jason Finch after it escaped onto a beach and swam 150 yards out to sea

This little piggie went swimming: The RSPCA was called after the baby pig became stuck at the top of a cliff above Covehithe beach in Suffolk, before tumbling down to the shoreline 

RSPCA inspector Jason Finch said he made his way down to the beach to try and catch it, but it panicked and turned on its trotters and ran into the sea.

He said: 'I couldn't believe it when he darted straight into the sea like that.

'He was completely unfazed by the bubbling surf and started diving up and down among the waves for ages - upwards of 10 minutes. He became a tiny black dot in the distance and at one point I thought he was heading to France.

'I was just wondering whether I would have to dive in myself when he started swimming in the more shallow end of the surf, so I just ran in and grabbed him.

'He was safe and sound and in good health - in fact he did not even seem puffed out. Far fitter than many I know.' 

The piglet, which weighed around 5lbs, swam out for 150 yards before turning round and heading back to shore as darkness was falling.

Mr Finch was then able wade into the surf and pick it up before returning the porker to staff at Church Farm, Covehithe. 

The pig escaped from an arc-shaped sty where it was being reared along with its brothers and sisters in a field. 

It then slipped under an electric wire fence and trotted 200 yards to the cliff where it got stuck before it fell to the beach.

Gill Middleditch, the wife of farmer Roger Middleditch, said: 'The piglets normally stay in their arcs with their mothers, but they sometimes climb out.

'They are mischievous little monkeys and on rare occasions they do go on walkabout. They usually stay fairly close to their mothers, but they can slip under the wire fence.

'This one obviously had quite an adventure and we are very grateful to the RSPCA for bringing it back.'
