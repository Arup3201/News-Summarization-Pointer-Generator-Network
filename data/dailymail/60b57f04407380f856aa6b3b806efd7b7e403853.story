Serena Williams emerged triumphant on an emotional return to Indian Wells on Friday, beating Monica Niculescu in straight sets at the BNP Paribas Open.

The world No 1 has not played at the tournament in the Californian desert, one of the biggest on the WTA Tour, since winning the title as a 19-year-old in 2001.

She was afforded a standing ovation as she walked out onto centre court, and the occasion seemed to affect her in the early stages as she found herself trailing 2-0.

But the 33-year-old American soon got into her rhythm and ground out a gutsy 7-5, 7-5 triumph in two hours four minutes.

Williams had thought about returning last year only to change her mind. She was jeered during her final victory over Kim Clijsters 14 years ago by a crowd unhappy that Venus Williams had pulled out of a scheduled semi-final against her sister the previous day at the last minute.

Critics believed matches between the siblings were fixed and Venus and the women's father and coach Richard claimed they were subjected to racist taunts in the stands.

Elsewhere in the women's second round on Friday, Romania's Simona Halep battled from a set down to defeat Russia's Daria Gavrilova - and dedicated the victory to her cousin, following his recent death.

'It's really tough to speak about this situation,' she said after her 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 win. 'It's a painful situation for everyone, for me and for my family.

'I just wanted to play this tournament because he loved tennis. He played tennis for many years. So I decided to stay here, because it was a little bit easier to pass this situation.

'I just want to dedicate this match to him, because he loved tennis and he was very talented.'
