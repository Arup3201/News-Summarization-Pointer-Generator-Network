This is the moment the captain of the South Korean ferry which capsized two weeks ago abandoned ship in his underpants - leaving hundreds of passengers, mostly children, to drown with the ship.

Lee Joon-seok, 68, was in charge of the Sewol, which was carrying 475 passengers when it turned sharply and later sank on April 16.

Yet, as this video shows, he was one of the first to escape. The death toll currently stands at 188, with 114 people believed to be still missing.

Abandon ship: Apparently wearing no trousers, Lee Joon-seok, 68, is seen clambering over the heavily-listing vessel's rails as he is helped onto a lifeboat while the ferry is still above water

Saving himself: He is then helped onto a life raft leaving hundreds of passengers behind

Apparently without wearing any trousers, Lee is seen clambering over the heavily-listing vessel's rails as he is helped onto a lifeboat while the ferry is still above water.

A second video that emerged today shows some of the people on the Sewol ferry as it began to sink.

Broadcast on the South Korean national TV network JTBC passengers are heard saying: 'Wow, it's tilting a lot. We're tilting to this side. Can't move.'

And: 'You think I'm really gonna die? What's going on?'

A teenage boy on the vessel captured these desperate moments on cell phone video. The teen's father gave the network the footage after authorities recovered his son's body and found the cell phone. Its memory card was still intact, JTBC reported.

At a press conference today, two Coast Guard members defended their rescue of Lee, insisting they didn't know it was him.

Capt. Kim Kyung-il said: 'No, absolutely not. I didn't find out until later. During the rescue, people were just dropping from the ferry ... falling into the sea.'

Coast Guard member Kim Yong-ki said it was difficult to tell the difference between crew members and passengers, adding: 'Everyone was wearing life vests so we couldn't tell who was crew or who was a passenger.

'The life vest covers the uniform. We could see the sleeves but in that situation we are not thinking about that.'

Lee and 14 crew members have been arrested, accused of negligence and of failing to help passengers in need.

It has since emerged that he initially told passengers to stay in their rooms and took half an hour to issue an evacuation order, by which time the ship was tilting too severely for many people to get out.

After his arrest he said that he withheld the evacuation order because rescuers had yet to arrive and he feared for passengers' safety in the cold water.

Meanwhile, South Korean authorities today arrested three people on suspicion of 
destroying evidence connected to the sinking of the ferry, CNN reported.

They also raided a Coast Guard office in Mokpo - the office that handles emergency calls - as part of an investigation into how officials handled the first plea for help from a passenger. They are looking into possible dereliction of duty, said Yang Joong-jin, the chief prosecutor in Mokpo.

The office received the first distress call from the ship when an 18-year-old boy dialed the 119 emergency number, the report said.

State-run news agency Yonhap reported: 'According to a transcript of the recording, a Coast Guard official asked the student to provide the latitude and longitude of his location, sparking criticism that authorities wasted crucial minutes before starting a rescue operation.

'The investigation team said it will

whether the authorities properly fulfilled their duties.'

It
 comes as an audio file recovered from a mobile phone belonging to a 
teenage boy who died in the disaster revealed the panic among passengers
 when they realised the ship was sinking.

The
 mobile phone containing the audio files was found among the belongings 
of a teenage boy whose body was recovered from the ferry.

The memory card on the phone was still intact, with the boy's father handing it over to South Korean news network JTBC, who later shared it with CNN who were able to translate the audio file.

The voices heard on the audio appear to be aware the ferry is listing, telling each other it was getting difficult to move because 'it's tilting a lot', according to CNN.

Another voice can be heard shouting: 'Mum, dad, dad, dad! What about my younger sibling?'

Yesterday 
divers renewed their search for the bodies still trapped inside the 
ferry after weekend efforts were hindered by bad weather, strong 
currents and floating debris clogging the ship's rooms.

Authorities now say they have narrowed down the likely locations of most of the remaining missing 100 or so passengers.

Divers
 found only one body yesterday after a week that saw an increasing 
number of corpses pulled from the ship as divers made their way through 
its labyrinth of cabins, lounges and halls.

Senior
 coastguard officer Kim Su-hyeon said most of the remaining missing 
passengers were believed to be in 64 of the ship's 111 rooms.

Divers
have entered 36 of those 64 rooms but may need to go back into some 
because floating debris made it difficult for divers to be sure that 
there were no more bodies.

Ko
 Myung-seok of the emergency task force said 92 divers were searching 
the ferry. He said the government was making plans to salvage the ferry 
once search efforts ended.

South
 Korea's prime minister resigned yesterday over the government's 
handling of the sinking, blaming 'deep-rooted evils' in society for the 
tragedy.

South Korean executive power is largely concentrated in the president, so Chung Hong-won's resignation appears to be symbolic.

Presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said President Park Geun-hye 
would accept the resignation, but did not say when Mr Chung would leave 
office.

Mr Chung's
 resignation comes amid rising indignation over claims by the victims' 
relatives that the government did not do enough to rescue or protect 
their loved ones.

Officials
 have taken into custody all 15 people involved in navigating the ferry.
 The seven other surviving crew members were not arrested as they held 
non-marine jobs such as chefs or stewards.

The arrested crew members are accused of negligence and of failing to help passengers in need.
