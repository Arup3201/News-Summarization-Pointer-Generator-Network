A battery of tests revealed she has leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a rare condition that occurs when cancer cells spread into the fluid-filled membrane surrounding the brain.

When asked how she’s tackling the unusual condition,

Speaking to Daily Mail Online at the AARP The Magazine's Movies for Grown-Ups Awards Gala at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Monday night, Harper said: ‘I do imagery and I talk to my cells. And I say listen you guys: “You are killing the host, we can live together but if you keep growing you are out of here, we both are.” I know it's silly.

‘It really is confronting it and seeing why are you here, what are you doing and how can I show the door.

'It is a way of being positive.’

Harper showed no signs of slowing down at the awards ceremony.The brave Emmy Award winning actress looked healthy and happy as usual despite her prognosis.

The Rhoda star said: ‘I am not cancer free. The cancer I have, there is no cure as of yet, however my doctors keep looking at the scans - every three months they scan my brain - it's in the lining of the brain and they say Valerie we cannot believe you are going the other way.

‘It is not gone it is there but it is so much less.’

After her diagnosis in January 2013 Harper defied the odds by competing on the physically challenging TV show 'Dancing with the Stars.'

Valerie and partner Tristan McManus managed to show off their fancy footwork until being eliminated in the fourth week.

In November, 2013 she appeared on the DWTS finale after which she proclaimed: ‘I'm feeling pretty good.’

Harper, who previously battled lung cancer in 2009, credits her doctors at Cedars Sinai Hospital for keeping her going to this day.

She is undergoing treatment, which can extend survival, but her condition is not curable.

She also credits acupuncture, traditional Chinese herbal medicine and ‘wonderful teas that keep your body flowing’.

‘So much of cancer is blockages in the body and they are all our own cells, it’s not an invading army, it is our own cells acting crazy,’ she said.

Despite the grim prognosis, her famous positivity hasn’t shifted, she told Daily Mail Online: ‘Cancer is like a bad performer. It goes on tour, no one wants to see them but they keep turning up. It's worse when they go on the road.

‘I am functioning really well. And a lot of what I am experiencing is age.’

She added that keeping the ‘kid’ in her helps a lot.

‘You don’t want to lose the kid all the way, because that is the essential you when you came on the stage of the planet.

‘Staying a kid, or at least be willing to have it be part of you.’

Harper has been married to husband Tony Cacciotti for 25 years, with who she has a daughter.

Harper says ‘staying a kid’ or be willing to at least have it be part of you’ is keeping her positive.

‘It’s that I don’t want to die, it’s I want to live,’ she explains.

‘As long as I’m here, every single moment is going to be as good as I can have it be.’
