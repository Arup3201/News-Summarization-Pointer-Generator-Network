It was the last resort of a hard-working single mother-of-four who, by her own admission, had 'never asked for anything from anyone'.

On Tuesday Helen Campochiaro, 38, of Hudson, Florida, set up an account on Go Fund Me, appealing for support for her family after she was left injured and financially drained by a recent car crash and needed to find a new place to live within two weeks.

However on Wednesday night, her 12-year-old son, Kevin Pimental, shot dead his six-year-old brother inside the mobile home he shared with his mother and three siblings, wounded his older brother in the leg, and then turned the gun on himself.

Campchiaro was working one of her two jobs at the time. 

'The mother's going through an absolute living hell right now,' Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said Thursday.

Horrific: Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot his brother Brady Pimentel, 6, dead Wednesday night at their mobile home in Hudson, Florida, before shooting his older brother in the leg and then killing himself

Victims: Six-year-old Brady Pimentel (left) was killed in the shooting, while Trevor Pimentel, 16 (right), is recovering in hospital from a gunshot to the leg. He is too traumatized to speak with police

Heartbroken: Helen Campochiaro has been described as a hard-working, caring mother who was trying to provide for her four children. She was working at the time of the tragedy, police said

Scene: The shooting occurred the family's mobile home at the Sugar Lane park mobile home at 16916 Bachmann Ave in Hudson, Florida, north of Tampa

The victims were identified as  six-year-old Brady Pimentel, who was pronounced dead at the scene, and 16-year-old Trevor Pimentel, who is recovering in hospital from a gunshot to the leg.

The three were home alone at the Sugar Lane Mobile Home Park north of Tampa while their mother was at work, Nocco said.

Nocco previously said the argument was over food.

Kevin and Trevor were believed to have been cooking together at the time of the incident, about 6pm.

But a day later, Nocco wouldn't talk about it, saying only that the older boys were preparing food and deputies were still investigating.

The sheriff refused to release many details about the crime, including the motive and where the boy got the gun, because he said deputies haven't told the mother yet.

'She doesn't yet know all the details,' Nocco said. 

'She can't handle that right now. She emotionally and physically can't handle that right now.'

Grief-stricken: Campochiaro shared this photo on her Facebook page following the horrific incident. It is an older picture of her two sons that died, Kevin (center) and Brady (right) 

Authorities said they have found no evidence that child welfare officials or police had ever been called to the home before the shooting.

Campochiaro was a hard-working woman who had two jobs so she could take care of her boys, the sheriff said. 

On her Facebook page she says that she makes themed cakes and is a seamstress.

Originally from New Jersey, she wrote that she 'will always be a Punk Jersey girl'.

Campochiaro had been in a car wreck recently, but didn't even go to the hospital because she had to work, Nocco said.

The boys' 18-year-old brother also lived at the home, but he was not there at the time of the shooting.

'It was a living night': Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco holds a press conference following the the shooting on Wednesday night, describing the scene to local media

Dedicated: Helen Campochiaro is a single mom with four son who worked two jobs to provide for her family. Her two youngest sons died on Wednesday night, and a third is in hospital

Helen's sister, Barbara Campochiaro, of Spring Hill, told The Tampa Bay Times the children 'were raised with gun safety' and that Helen owned a firearm, though she was not sure what kind.

'She was a single mom with four boys. Unfortunately, she could only afford to live in a trailer,' Campochiaro said. 

'She just had it (a gun) for protection.'

Kevin was in middle school. Brady attended elementary school and Trevor took virtual high school classes at home in the mornings and culinary classes at a technical school in the afternoons.

Grief counselors were at the schools to talk to their friends, students and teachers.

Trevor is in the hospital, and is expected to be OK. When deputies tried to talk to him, his heart rate spiked.

'You've got a 16-year-old who just saw something horrific, a living nightmare. I would never want anyone to be in his shoes. He's grieving right now. He just lost two brothers,' Nocco said.

The family lived in the mobile home park off a dirt road in Hudson, which is about 30 miles north of Tampa on Florida's Gulf coast.

Appeal: Helen Campichiaro set up this Go Fund Me page asking for financial help the day before the shooting. Since the tragedy, donations have skyrocketed to over $4,000

On March 24, the day before the shooting, Campichiaro set up the Go Fund Me account asking for financial assistance from her friends and family.

She was trying to raise a deposit for a new place. 

'Me and my boys have had to start over from uncontrolled circumstances,too many times,' Campichiaro wrote on her account.

'Divorce,theft, abuse ... I have sold almost everything I own to make a better life for my boys,more than once.My four boys are my world and I revolve and live for them.I work 7 days a week self employed being able to work around them.'

Campichiaro also alluded to having to leave her children at home while she worked.

'I regretfully feel like I never see my boys,' she wrote.

'They are so good and so understanding.They do more than their share at home and for me.Least I can do is put them in a good home.I believe in paying it forward and try to do my part everyday.'

Friends of Campachiaro have set up a separate fundraiser for her on Give Forward, which has already received over $5,000 in donations.

'She is a devoted mom, an extremely hard worker, and an incredible business woman,' the page says of Campachiaro.

'Please help raise money for her family, for her son in the hospital recovering, and many, many expenses. Two of her sons were killed while she was at work, anything helps.'
