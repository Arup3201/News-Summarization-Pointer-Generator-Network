A life cut short: Hannah Timings was on a backpacking tour of New Zealand when she went missing. Police believe they have found her body in the wreck of a helicopter, eight years after she went missing

A body has been found in New Zealand, believed to be Hannah Timings from Toddington, Gloucestershire, who vanished eight years ago after a helicopter crash.

Hannah, who was 28, was flying with her boyfriend Kiwi pilot Campbell Montgomerie, 27, when their helicopter went missing in 2004. It was thought the pair died in a crash, but their helicopter had not been found until now.

A helicopter wreckage was discovered in Fiordland, a remote part of the country on the South Island, yesterday. 

Police say the helicopter is the same aircraft that went missing in 2004.

Hannah Timings was a London-based project manager working for Viscount Linley's furniture business when she went to New Zealand on a six-month backpacking tour. 

She and Campbell set off on a 
helicopter tour of New Zealand’s South Island peaks on January 3 2004. They were on a scenic trip from the alpine resort of Queenstown to the renowned beauty spot of Milford Sound.

An hour after take-off she and Campbell flew into thick cloud and 
radioed the local control tower for directions.

Soon after all radio contact was suddenly lost and they were not heard of since.

An extensive two-week search at the time of the crash failed to turn up any sign of the missing aircraft.

The wreckage was spotted yesterday in rugged terrain at the edge of the original search area by another helicopter pilot.

A specialist police team, including alpine cliff rescue members, recovered two bodies and were hoping to formally identify them by using DNA samples.

They said Hannah's family had been told and officers hoped the discovery would bring them some closure.

Inspector Olaf Jensen, of Invercargill, New Zealand said: 'The helicopter's wreckage is spread across a large area in rugged terrain.

'The weather in the area is good and the team is hoping to complete the scene examination.'

Pilot Brendan Hiatt, from Glacier Southern Lakes Helicopters, said he was on the way back to Queenstown after picking up two American couples, when he spotted something below.

He said: 'I just spotted something glinting that just didn't look quite right amongst the snow, so I said 'we'll just take a look'.

'It's happened before, where you see a glinting rock or something that you go in closer for a look at. We got close and it was pretty evident what it was.'

At the time of the helicopter's 
disappearance, rescuers spent 204 flying hours and 2,300 man hours 
searching the mountainous area where the four-seater privately-owned 
helicopter was lost.

Bryan
Nicholson, a spokesman for the British High Commission in New Zealand, 
said at the time that trying to find them really was like trying to find
'a needle in a haystack'.

In 2006 Hannah's family, who described her as 'an absolutely lovely and loving girl' who adored adventure and the outdoor life, won a battle for a £10,000 life insurance policy payout from Columbus.

Hannah's father Phil said the money had been divided between her brother Sam and sister Layla.
