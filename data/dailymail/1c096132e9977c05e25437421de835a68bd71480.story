Arsenal face a backlash from fans after it emerged that the club’s only January signing was already injured when he arrived.

Kim Kallstrom, signed on loan from Spartak Moscow on deadline day, reportedly sustained a back injury playing football on a beach during his former side’s winter break in Abu Dhabi last week - and he is now expected to miss at least six matches.

Arsene Wenger’s side have their best chance of winning a Premier League trophy in years and supporters were keen for him to capitalise on that  by strengthening their squad in the  January transfer window by signing a much-needed striker.

But not only did Arsenal fail to bring in a big-name forward, they also missed out on a player they dubbed ‘the new Thierry Henry’, Schalke winger Julian Draxler, instead signing Swedish midfielder Kallstrom as cover for  Mathieu Flamini, who is suspended for three games, and injured duo Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere.

Wenger is expected to reveal the likely length of Kallstrom’s injury in the next 24 hours. The club have said that the problem was identified during the medical and that they chose to proceed with the transfer regardless because they are confident he will play an  important part later in the season.

Kallstrom did not train on Saturday and the Swede could not have played against Crystal Palace on Sunday because he was not registered as an Arsenal player in time.

But the 31-year-old, who has been capped more than 100 times by his  country, is expected to miss Arsenal’s two matches against Liverpool as well as games against Manchester United, Bayern Munich in the Champions League and Sunderland.

It is understood that Kallstrom will briefly return to Sweden and Russia before moving to London and beginning a course of treatment.

The former Lyon midfielder had been brought in as cover for the injured Ramsey, who is set to miss six weeks.

However, the Swede now faces a spell on the sidelines himself and will is being assessed over the weekend.

International: Kallstrom, who has made over 100 appearances for Sweden, will briefly return to his home country before moving to London
