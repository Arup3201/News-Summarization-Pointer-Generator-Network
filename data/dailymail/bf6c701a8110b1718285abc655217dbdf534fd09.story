This astonishing collection of photographs was discovered in a rusty metal box by Peter Berry Ottaway, 71, in the home of his late grandfather, Hubert Ottaway, who was a sapper (or combat engineer) in the Territorial Army between 1914 and 1919. He captured the rare images while he was stationed in northern France. He worked with the Light Engineers Railway Companies who were tasked with supplying communication lines towards Belguim and upgrading trenches. Hubert's pictures provide a unique glimpse into life on the Western Front in the final 18 months of the Great War. He captured the aftermath of British offensives, including the Battle of Arras, and took photos of the devastation and desolation of villages which were razed in the path of armies from both sides during the conflict. Peter, who lives in Hereford, spent four years trying to get the images developed. After painstaking work, 40 of the 50 pictures were salvaged along with Hubert’s diary.

Destruction: The previously unseen images paint a unique portrait of life on the Western Front in the final months of the Great War, portraying the damage that was inflicted on buildings in the north of France, near to the border with Belgium

Ruins: The photographs, which were taken by Territorial Army sapper Hubert Berry Ottaway, showed how villages were left devastated by shelling with churches and houses being being left in ruins by both the British and the German forces

Desolation: A staircase which was once encased inside in a building is left standing after the surrounding walls were destroyed during fighting in the Flanders region of northern France. This area saw huge amounts of fighting and was the first battlefield experienced by British troops when they travelled across to mainland Europe

Remembering the fallen: Ottoway also took photos of memorials which were constructed in the aftermath of offensives or incursions. Here, Canadian troops are remembered underneath a crucifix engraved into the ground with the letters RIP written above

Incursion: The ruins of a building in the city of Arras, the location of one Britain's most important offences in 1917. When the battle officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough

Escaping the carnage: Pictures show thousands of villagers whose homes had been destroyed along the Western Front carrying their possessions on their backs. They left the region searching for a different place to stay while the heavy fighting continued

Many of the images were taken in the aftermath of the Battle of Arras in 1917. It was was a British offensive where British, Canadian, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and Australian troops attacked German defences near the French city of Arras on the Western Front

Boulders: A picture of artillery equipment used surrounded by rubble in the aftermath Battle of Arras. Mr Ottaway was a was as a 'Sapper' (combat engineer) in the Territorial Army and had 14 military years of experience behind him. He was tasked with trench design and the establishment of communications and supply routes, he also had to transport ammo, food and bodies

Portrait: An image of four soldiers from the Royal Engineers Light Railway Companies taken in 1918. Unlike most Army units, troops in these groups placed a great reliance on the leadership and skills of the Non-Commissioned Officers

Off the tracks: Two soldiers from the Royal Engineers Light Railway Company pose next to a derailed train near the city of Arras

Foreign troops: Some of pictures include extremely rare shots of members of the Chinese Labour Corp who were recruited by Britain to help with the war effort. Around 150,000 Chinese men and boys, some as young as 14, were recruited from the provinces and shipped to the front line from 1915 to provide a labour force for the British Army

Model: Mr Ottway's probable camera was a Kodak no 2 Brownie. The first model produced in 1900 was made out of a cardboard box with a simple meniscus lens that took 2¼-inch square pictures on 117 rollfilm. The photos were then developed by Peter Ottway, Hubert's great-grandson, who spent five years putting together the collection at his home in Much Dewchurch, Hereford

Road into France: A typical tree-lined, cobbled road in Flanders which was the first sight to greet British troops as they made their way across the Channel to join in the war effort. Many had never left the United Kingdom and thousands would not return

Links: A group of soldiers stand in front of a van in Flanders. Many of the servicemen who Mr Ottway spent his time with were employed to set up lines of communication and upgrade trenches across France and Belgium

Heads up: A solider pokes his head from about a train on a railway in northern France. Mr Ottaway spent his time in Flanders, Belgium and Arras in France travelling along the railways until he returned to Britain in 1919

Under attack: The city of Arras is located in Northern France on the banks of Scarpe river. Boves (or underground tunnels) below the city were used throughout World War I to hide residents during attacks

Sending in the cavalry: It has been estimated that many millions of horses were employed by both sides in the conflict and between six and eight million died  throughout the duration of the Great War
