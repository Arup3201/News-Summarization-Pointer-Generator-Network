The 48-year-old woman was sentenced to seven years in jail for physically, sexually and emotionally tormenting her 15-year-old nephew for five months 

A 48-year-old woman has been sentenced to seven years in jail for torturing her nephew for five months while he was under her care.

The Brisbane District Court heard how she subjected the 15-year-old to 'subhuman' punishments that turned his life into a 'living hell' and left him with psychological trauma after he was left in her care following abuse from his own mother.

These punishments included force-feeding him chillies and laxatives before refusing to let him into the bathroom to clean himself during his stay at her farm in Brisbane's north, according to the Courier Mail.

On another occasion, he was made to consume a large number of worming tablets as well as castor oil before being forced to attend school without being allowed to clean himself up.

More examples of humiliation were revealed in the courtroom including instances where the teenager was forced to shave his genitals and, on a separate occasion, filmed while being forced to penetrate himself with a sex toy by both his aunt and her daughter who was aged in her 20s. 

The women threatened to release the footage publicly if the boy told anyone of the abuse he was suffering.

Instances of physical abuse, including punching the teens face, using a stock whip on him and using pliers to squeeze his fingers, were also listed. 

The boy was warned not to inform anyone of the torture or else a 'bikie friend' would find and kill him, however police were eventually notified in mid-2012.

'It suggests a fundamental personality dysfunction with a deeply rooted capacity to cause serious harm,' Judge Leanne Clare said of the aunt's behaviour.

The judge at  Brisbane's District Court ruled that there was 'focus, deliberation and sadism' in her actions

The woman's defence representative told the court that she suffered from depression, anxiety and possible post-traumatic stress disorder from a history of abuse and loss. 

He also reinstating the woman's claims that her nephew was difficult to deal with, however Judge Clare rejected the claims.

The 48-year-old pleaded guilty to her charges in February, but the Courier Mail revealed that she had previously intended to call in her victim for cross-examination.

'The repeated infliction of intense pain and suffering was a drawn-out course of conduct. It was not so much a lack of control of passing anger, there was focus, deliberation and sadism in what you did,' Judge Clare said during the sentencing.

'There was the sexual humiliation. It was committed against a record for significant violence. Those features in my view make this an appropriate case for the postponement of parole eligibility.'

The boy's female cousin was also given a two year jail term.
