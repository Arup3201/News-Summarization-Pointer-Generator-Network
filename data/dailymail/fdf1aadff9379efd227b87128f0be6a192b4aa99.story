Theresa May is seen as a more likely Tory leader than Boris Johnson by the party’s future MPs, a poll has found.

The Home Secretary regularly appears at the top of polls of party members of their favourite politician.

But Mrs May is also better liked than the London Mayor among those candidates on a ‘Future MPs Panel’, according to the survey conducted by Populus. 

Leading the charge: Theresa May (left) is a more likely Tory leader than Boris Johnson (right) a poll of future MPs has found

It found one in four of those questioned thought she would be the next party leader – whether there is a leadership election later this year in the wake of a Tory election defeat or in six years.

Some 26 per cent of those asked backed Mrs May, compared to 22 per cent for Mr Johnson, and 12 per cent for Sajid Javid, rising star of the Tory Right, who is Culture Secretary.

The poll will disappoint those Tories who want Chancellor George Osborne to succeed Mr Cameron, who did not register as a potential future leader.

Mrs May is seen by allies as Britain’s Angela Merkel and is the longest serving home secretary in more than 50 years. 

She will challenge Mr Johnson – whom she is thought to regard as a ‘faintly ridiculous figure’ – if the Tories lose the election and Mr Cameron stands down. 

Mr Johnson is expected to return to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge, having been selected as the party’s candidate for the election, while continuing in his role as mayor.

Future Labour MPs told Populus that Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, was favourite to be the party’s next leader.

One in four picked the Merseyside MP and former arch Blairite whose politics have become notably more left wing in recent years.

Close behind him was Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna on 22 per cent and Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, on 21 per cent.

Populus interviewed 147 MPs and prospective parliamentary candidates between January 20 and February 13, all of whom are expected to win their seats.
