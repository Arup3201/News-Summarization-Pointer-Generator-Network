Each week Sportsmail gather the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Barclays Premier League starting XI of the day.

Saturday saw Chelsea take charge at the top as they got revenge against Newcastle United, and Manchester City slipped up as they were held by Everton at Goodison Park.

But defenders were the main men on Saturday with Everton's John Stones and Crystal Palace's Scott Dann leading the way. So, here is our team of the day. 

GK - Petr Cech (CHELSEA vs Newcastle United) - 7

The goalkeeper was to thank for keeping Chelsea from going behind in the first half, despite making only his second league start.

DEF - John Stones (EVERTON vs Manchester City) - 8.5

Will be a mainstay of England's defence in years to come, an impeccable performance and calming presence on the back four.

DEF - Damien Delaney (CRYSTAL PALACE vs Tottenham Hotspur) - 8

Immense at the heart of Palace's back-four. Showed sheer will to win.

DEF - Scott Dann (CRYSTAL PALACE vs Tottenham Hotspur) - 8.5

Will be a key man for Pardew and showed why on Saturday. Excellent.

DEF - Paul Konchesky (LEICESTER CITY vs Aston Villa) - 8

Scored and earned Leicester what could prove a pivotal three points at the end of this Premier League season.

MID - Oscar (CHELSEA vs Newcastle United) - 7.5

Sent Chelsea ahead with a calm finish at the back post then played an exquisite back-heel flick to set up Costa for their second.

MID - David Silva (Everton vs MANCHESTER CITY) - 8

A joy to watch, had Everton in a panic every time he got possession. Played a different game to the others in laser blue.

MID - Philippe Coutinho (Sunderland vs LIVERPOOL) - 8

Outstanding, so easy on the eye and terrorised hosts with his cunning runs. Man of the match.

FWD - Saido Berahino (WEST BROM vs Hull City) - 7.5

Won the game for West Brom 12 minutes from time and looked a threat whenever in possession. Looked every bit a £20million performance.

FWD - Romelu Lukaku (EVERTON vs Manchester City) - 7.5

Took confidence from his equaliser against West Ham, played well. Denied a goal by terrific save from Hart.
