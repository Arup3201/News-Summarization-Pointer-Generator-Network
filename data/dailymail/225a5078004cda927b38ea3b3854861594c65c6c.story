The career of Philip Fenton is hanging in the balance after the Irish Turf Club confirmed it will launch its own investigation in the aftermath of the Irish trainer being found guilty of possessing banned anabolic steroids.

Cheltenham Festival-winner Fenton, 49, was  fined 6,000 euros on Thursday and ordered to pay costs of 4,200 euros after a County Tipperary court handed down a eight guilty verdicts for possessing unlicenced animal remedies.

Among them was 1kg of Nitrotain, enough for 250 doses. The court was told it was hard to find a more potent a source of Anabolic Steroids.

Nitrotain contains Ethylestranol which improves muscle mass and stamina and toughens bones in horses.

Also found was a 20ml bottle of Ilium Stanabolic, containing the performance-enhancing Anabolic Steroid Stanozolol as well as prescription only medications without the necessary paperwork.

Ministry of Agriculture vets found the illegal drugs in a cardboard box covered by a horse blanket in a ‘horse spa’ close to Fenton’s medicine store in a raid in January 2012.

As he left the hearing in Carrick-on-Suir, Fenton said only that he was considering an appeal against the verdict but he could face interview by Turf Club Officials by as early as next week.

Turf Club chief executive Denis Egan said: ‘No horses have tested positive but that fact that Anabolic Steroids have been found is a very serious matter.

‘We will want to move this forward as quickly as possible.’

Trainer Fenton was found guilty of possessing banned Anabolic Steroids and his career remains precarious

An attempt by Fenton’s legal team to have the case dismissed because protocols has been breached during the investigation was dismissed by Judge Timothy Lucey.

Fenton, a former amateur jockey, has been training since 2004.

His biggest win in Britain came when Dunguib landed the Cheltenham Festival Bumper in 2008. He also won the Irish Hennessy Gold Cup with Last Instalment at Leopardstown in February.

The pair were part of a three-horse team that Fenton ran at last season’s Festival but only after the horses had been tested by BHA officials.

Fenton’s case follows a similar fine being handed down to Irish National winning trainer Pat Hughes earlier this month after he was also sound guilty of possessing illegal substances including Anabolic Steroids.

The cases have cast a dark cloud over Irish racing.

The Anabolic Steroids involved are the same used by disgraced trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni in the case which heaped shame on Sheik Mohammed’s Godolphin operation last year.
