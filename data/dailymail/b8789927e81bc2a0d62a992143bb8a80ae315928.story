Hundreds of passengers were forced to evacuate a Polish plane after the fire alarm started going off and prompted an emergency landing at Glasgow Airport.

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was en route to Warsaw from Chicago when the flight crew received a warning from the firefighting system in the luggage hold.

More than 247 passengers and 12 crew were on board the LOT Polish Airlines flight when the crew declared the emergency over the Atlantic Ocean.

It is not known what triggered the warning system and there were no reports of fire or smoke within the Dreamliner, a model that has been grounded in the past over safety fears.

Glasgow Airport spokesman Brian McClean told MailOnline the landing was made at the request of the captain and the airport declared a full emergency as a precautionary measure.

Witness Andrew Workman took photos as flight LO004 landed safely shortly before 11.30am.

The Dreamliner was met on arrival by emergency services and was allowed to taxi to the main terminal building after an inspection by firefighters did not find any flames or smoke.

No injuries were reported.

Technicians inspected the plane after it landed and deemed it safe, according to an airline spokeswoman

None of the passengers are believed to have suffered any injuries or smoke inhalation

Glasgow Airport remained open and operational throughout the ordeal and all passengers were kept on the aircraft while technicians inspected the plane.

LOT spokeswoman Barbara Pijanowska-Kuras said: ‘They assessed the aircraft and deemed it safe.’

All passengers disembarked as normal and arrangements were made for alternative transportation to Warsaw.

The fire alarm system was undergoing additional checks.

Boeing's flagship 787 model made its maiden flight in December 2009 following two years' of delays, and its brief history has been a troubled one.

Despite the fanfare surrounding the iconic plane, the model has suffered extensive delays, manufacturing holdups and problems with its lithium-ion batteries in a program worth an estimated £19million.

Boeing's flagship 787 model made its maiden flight in December 2009 following two years' of delays, and its brief history has been a troubled one.

Despite the fanfare surrounding the iconic plane, the model has suffered extensive delays, manufacturing holdups and problems with its lithium-ion batteries in a program worth an estimated £19m.

Last year, the world's entire Dreamliner fleet was grounded for three months - just two years after entering commercial service - for repairs after two lithium-ion batteries burned in two incidents in Japan and the United States.

Japan's transportation authority was unable to identify the cause of a lithium-ion battery problem

The Japanese probe into a battery problem that forced the emergency landing of a Dreamliner last year wrapped up Thursday with investigators saying they still haven't found the root cause.

The domestic All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight on January 16, 2013 was forced to make an emergency landing after pilots noticed a burning smell inside the cockpit that was traced to the plane's lithium-ion battery pack. 

In a separate incident in July last year, a Dreamliner caught fire at Heathrow Airport. British investigators traced the probable cause to faulty wiring of a lithium battery in an emergency beacon. 

A now-rectified issue also saw around 42 Dreamliners suffer from hairline fractures in the wings.
