It shows a chef in a restaurant in Japan, stabbing, beheading and skinning a live frog to serve as sashimi and has sparked outrage online.

The bullfrog, served on ice with soy sauce and a lemon slice goes through a torturous process before being served.

You can see the chef in the video stabbing the animal, then beheading and skinning it right before your eyes.

Though the frog is killed instantly by the chef’s knife, it can still be seen moving it's legs and blinking at the camera.

Japanese chef Mamie Nishide, from New York's Japanese Cooking Studio, told Fox News that it wasn't a typical dish.

'I just don’t want you to think this is Japanese food that the Japanese enjoy. It’s not. This is bizarre.'

The restaurant in Tokyo's 'Memory Lane' is known for serving unusual dishes such as soft-shelled turtle, pig testicles, snake liquor, grilled salamander, still-beating frog's heart and the live bullfrog sashimi shown in the video.

Located in the Shunjuku district of Tokyo which is lined with restaurants that serve similar bizarre dishes, the area draws in tourists and Japanese with a rather eclectic palate.
