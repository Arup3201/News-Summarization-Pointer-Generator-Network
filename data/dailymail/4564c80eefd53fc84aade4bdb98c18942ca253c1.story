The nation's highest-ranking military officer joined those calling for the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.

General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Fox News Sunday he believes that closing the prison is in the national interest.

'I’ve been in the group that believes it’s in our national interest to close Guantanamo,' Dempsey said about the detention center at the US Navy base in Cuba.

Scarring: General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believes closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is in the national interest

'It does create a psychological scar on our national values. Whether it should or not, it does,' he added.

Dempsey appeared on the show as Sunday marked the 13th anniversary of the opening of detention facilities at the base.

There are currently 127 prisoners in the facility, though the US recently transferred a number of detainees as it tries to close the prison, a campaign pledge made by President Obama back in 2008.

Dempsey said there about a dozen detainees 'simply will not be released' and stated what to do with them will come down to a policy decision for officials if they cannot be brought to the US.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman also touched on the ongoing conflict in Syria and Iraq involving Islamic extremist group ISIS, saying its own violent nature will eventually drive away its members.

According to Dempsey, the US also had the capability to strike Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria if ordered by President Obama.

He was cautious on the future of Afghanistan, saying 'there will be pockets of that country that change hands from time to time.'

'We’re going to have to keep an eye on them,' he said. 'I tend to be a little paranoid. … Terrorism flows where instability lurks.'
