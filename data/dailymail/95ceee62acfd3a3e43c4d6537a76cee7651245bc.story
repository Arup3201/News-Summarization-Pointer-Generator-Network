Proud: Princess Eugenie pictured on Tuesday following a service of thanksgiving to mark her grandmother's 60 years as Queen

Princess Eugenie has told how her grandmother the Queen would have found the final two days of the Diamond Jubilee 'quite testing' without Prince Philip by her side.

The Duke of Edinburgh was taken ill on Sunday with a bladder infection, after standing for hours in the teeming rain as the Jubilee River Pageant made its way along the Thames.

Nevertheless, the princess described her grandparents as a 'power couple who kind of astound people' as she gave the first interview by a royal following the Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

Princess Eugenie, 22, told Sky News: 'To see Granny and Grandpa standing for four hours, I mean, together, they are invincible.

'They are the most incredibly supportive couple to each other. Grandpa was unfortunately taken ill and for Granny to come and do that alone was probably quite testing and I think he is her rock really and she is his.'

Yesterday afternoon Princes William and Harry visited the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital after the Palace confirmed he won't be be out in time celebrate his 91st birthday at home tomorrow.

Philip had been planning to celebrate privately with his family and was not due to attend his next scheduled engagement until Tuesday, when the Queen hosts a garden party at the Sandringham Estate.

His sudden illness marred the Queen's celebrations, but Princess Eugenie nevertheless described the four days of national celebrations as an 'unbelievable experience that will forever stay with me.'

'To see the showing that people gave (The Queen) is just unfathomable for me. I just think it's unbelievable and it makes me so proud,' she told Sky News.

Eugenie and her sister, Princess Beatrice, travelled the length of Sunday's river pageant with their father, the Duke of York, aboard the historic Havengore barge.

Her mother, Sarah Ferguson, who was not part of the celebrations, tweeted: 'Sooo proud of my girls smiling broadly, celebrating Granny with the Nation and Eugie with her flag and both happy smiles.'

Princess Eugenie also told Sky News that one of her highlights of the Jubilee celebrations was the pop concert in front of Buckingham Palace.

Treatment: Prince Philip's bladder infection could have been exacerbated by not taking enough toilet breaks during the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant

'It was phenomenal,' she said. 'The 
lighting, Madness on the roof, and the best was Robbie Williams doing 
that shout out for me and my sister.

'The
whole thing was just an unbelievable experience that will forever stay 
with me because I got to actually be there and take part and see and 
hear everything.

'The amount
of people who came out to support was amazing and that exceeded my 
expectations more than anything because it just showed how much everyone
loves my granny.'

She was speaking on the eve of a 
planned charity bicycle ride which she is doing to raise money for her 
new Patronage, the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.

Beginning at 1am tomorrow morning, the princess will ride 100km around London to raise money for the hospital and the Marylebone Cricket Club Foundation Appeal.

When she was 12, Princess Eugenie herself underwent surgery at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital to put two 12in rods in her spine to correct curvature.

She said that her experience of this procedure helped her to relate to other patients going through the same problems.

And she admitted there were also lighter moments. 'It is sometimes quite fun because my friends can put magnets on my back and they kind of hang off,' she said. 'It's really weird!'
