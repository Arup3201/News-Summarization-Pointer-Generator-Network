These foolhardy men ignored warnings to stay clear of the coast during the heavy storms that have battered Britain.

One surfer was pictured flying off his board as he tried to take on waves near Newquay, Cornwall.

And two other daredevils tried to harness the elements using their power kite, which lifted them off the ground above Brighton Beach in East Sussex just feet from dangerous breaking waves.

Undeterred by the huge waves, the men 
took turns to perform acrobatics on their stunt kite as they filmed 
their exploits on mobile phones.

Both of the unnamed men wore harnesses connecting them to the huge kite as they frolicked on the otherwise deserted shoreline.

One of the pair came perilously close to falling into the chilly English Channel when a gust of wind blew him towards the water.

Members
 of the public have been repeatedly warned to stay away from coastal 
areas during the past week as beaches across the country are hit by 
fierce tides and storms.

Seven people have died since the first outbreak of poor weather hit Britain at the beginning of the Christmas period.

The country endured the wettest December in more than half a century as around 6.5 inches (165.1 mm) of rain fell in the South East last month – the most since 1959.

The
 storms which continued to lash the country yesterday have changed the 
shape of the British coastline, with many natural landmarks washed away 
by the fierce waves.

Risky: The men were lifted several feet off the ground by the powerful wind

Officials around the country have pleaded with people to keep away from 
the coast as onlookers continue to put their lives at risk by watching 
high waves crashing on to land.

Nightclubber Joanna Brown was killed after she ran into the sea at Brighton Beach at 2am on December 21.

The 36-year-old's body was washed onto the shore at Seaford following a major search and rescue mission.

Searches
 are continuing in south Devon for missing 18-year-old student Harry 
Martin, who was last seen leaving his home to take photographs of the 
weather – with more than 100 people volunteering to look for him.

Speed: The wind carries the would-be stuntman across the beach

Jeopardy: Officials say people are putting their lives at risk by heading to the coast in poor weather

Lifted: The men were using a power kite, which are often used when kitesurfing

Down to earth: One of the men tries to control the kite from the pebble beach

And tributes have been paid to Harry Swordy, who died after  being washed out to sea in Cornwall on New Year’s Day.

The 27-year-old  from Guildford, Surrey, had gone for a paddle with friends at Loe Bar beach in  Cornwall but was dragged out by a huge wave.

Friends Tom and Lou Luddington wrote online: ‘Harry was such an amazing character, so full of life.’

Concern was also growing for 76-year-old dementia sufferer Shirley Coalbran, who was known  to love the seafront, after she went missing from her coastal home in Hastings, East Sussex.

Fearless: One-legged Rik Bennett has been a regular feature on stormy days on the Cornish coast for years. He is pictured here on Monday off St Agnes

Surfing: Amputee Mr Bennett, 44 - nicknamed Pegleg - because he uses a prosthetic limb - defied warnings to steer clear of the raging swell off St Agnes

Over and out: Onlookers looked on in disbelief as he barrelled through the surf, being thrown off by a monster wave
