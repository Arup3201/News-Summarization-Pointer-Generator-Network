Counter-terrorism police have arrested two men suspected of involvement in the Syrian insurgency at Heathrow Airport in separate operations.

The men, aged 19 and 20, are being held in separate South London police stations where they are being questioned by anti terrorism officers.

Police arrested the teenager under suspicion that he was travelling to Syria to take part in the insurgency.

The teenager is not understood to be British was arrested before he boarded the aircraft.

Officers have also searched a flat in Camden, London, as part of the the investigation.

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'Officers from the MPS Counter Terrorism Command, SO15, have today arrested a 19 year-old man at Heathrow on suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism (Terrorism Act 2006).

'Officers have searched an address in Camden. The arrested man remains in custody at a police station in south London. Enquiries continue.'

The arrest is not in response to any immediate risk or threat.

Counter terrorism made a second arrest later, detaining a 20-year-old British national as he arrived at Heathrow Airport.

A Metropolitan Police spokesperson confirmed that the second man was arrested under suspicion of sending money or property overseas for the purposes of assisting in terrorism in Syria.

A spokesperson said: 'Investigations are ongoing at present. The two arrests are not being linked at the moment.'

Earlier this month a Muslim who ran a scheme to prevent 
violent extremism yesterday became the first Briton to be found guilty 
of travelling to Syria to fight in the civil war.

Police said the conviction of Mashudur 
Choudhury, 31, was likely to pave the way for others returning from the 
fighting to be prosecuted.

Security risk: Scotland Yard said the arrest was not related to any imminent threat

Last week Syrian rebel commander Brigadier-General Abdulellah al-Basheer said British jihadists make up the largest 
foreign contingent of one of the most violent terrorist groups,
 now infamous for beheading, crucifying and stoning to death enemies.

Almost two out of three of The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) fighters are foreign-born and have chosen to join a group bent on 
creating anÂ Islamic state in the war-torn country and Iraq.

Yesterday Syrian rebels blew up a tunnel packed 
with explosives in the northern city of Aleppo, killing at 
least 20 pro-government fighters, activists and rebels said.
