The mystery surrounding the demise of Jagger - an Irish setter which died under suspicious circumstances after returning from a dog show in Birmingham - could finally be solved.

The beloved dog died days after returning from the Crufts show in Birmingham, sparking an international murder mystery and claims he was 'murdered' by a bitter rival.

And just as toxicology reports this week showed he had died after ingesting a fast-acting illegal pesticide, residents of his hometown of Lauw, Belgium, have revealed the small village is in the grip of a suspected serial cat killer.

It was revealed two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran- were to blame for Jagger's death, while residents in his hometown have revealed their fears they are in the grip of a serial cat killer

Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Lauw, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show.

His devastated owner Aleksandra Lauwers, 34, was convinced the pedigree dog must have been given the beef laced with poison at the event - as it was the only time the dog was alone.

However, toxicology reports released this week suggested he must have ingested it at his home in Belgium as the poison discovered in his system is notoriously fast-acting.

Now locals have claimed ten dead cats have been found in the past two months alone.

One resident, Els van Marsenille, claimed she had lost three since January and her neighbour two, according to David Sanderson, reporting for The Times.

Local Linda Jans said she was now too scared to take her dogs out for walks in the village, claiming a pet killer unhappy about dogs' barking could operate quickly by simply throwing poison out into the streets and parks.

Prize-winning Irish Setter Jagger was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of Belgium

Local veterinarian Patrick Jans, (unrelated to Ms Jans), said he was waiting on toxicology reports to reveal what killed the local cats, but said there were 'symptoms suggestive of intoxication'. 

Their claims are backed up by the evidence - Caroline Kisko, secretary for the Kennel Club which organises Crufts, said this week two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for Jagger's death.

'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death.

'We have had confirmation, including from independent toxicologists, that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting.

'Severe clinical symptoms would usually occur within half an hour to three hours.

'Considering we are told that Jagger showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in Belgium, late on Friday March 6 night, leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention, we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at Crufts on Thursday March 5, some 28 to 36 hours earlier.'

The family's vet Dr Patrick Jans reiterated this - telling the Mail Jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died.

'I doubt that it happened at Crufts. I think it's unlikely because of the long time delay. I am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case.'
