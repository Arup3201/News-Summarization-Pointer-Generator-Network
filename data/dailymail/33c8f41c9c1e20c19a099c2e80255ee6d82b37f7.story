An outspoken Labour MP has admitted going on ecstasy-fuelled nights out when he was younger - and smoking cannabis twice a week.

Simon Danczuk said he had decided to tell the truth after his ex-wife went public about his drug-taking past.

Mr Danczuk, who has risen to prominence in the Commons with outspoken attacks on Labour's record on welfare, admitted he had taken ecstasy ‘many, many years ago’.

Labour's Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk and his wife Karen have become one of the most high profile couples in Parliament. Mr Danczuk wrote a bombshell expose on the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith and the abuse of young boys at Knowl View School

He added and that he used to smoke marijuana ‘a couple of times a week’ - but rejected claims he smoked every day after work.

The Labour MP also insisted that he did not use any drugs between 2007 and 2010, in the run up to the general election, when he won his Rochdale seat with a wafer thin majority.

Mr Danczuk told the Sun on Sunday: 'I am not proud of this story but once confronted by The Sun newspaper about my past I decided to be honest.

'It’s worth noting there are some inaccuracies in the story and it does not tell the true story.'

Mr Danczuk’s first wife Sonia Milewski, 37, claims they used to have ecstasy-fuelled nights out in Manchester before they were married.

Ms Milewski, who has two children by the Rochdale MP, alleges that he took drugs while a councillor for Blackburn and Darwen and a mature sociology student at Lancaster University.

She told the paper: 'We’d go out and do pills a couple of time a week. I think because he was a mature student, it was his way of catching up.'

Karen Danczuk has insisted that her 'cleavage selfies' were accidental and that she did not publish the snaps because she looked nice

Mrs Danczuk dismissed criticism of the images from female politicians. She said women should not 'bitching' about each other

Mr Danczuk admitted smoking cannabis with his first wife and said he may have taken ecstasy ‘once or twice’ as a teenager. He added he had never used cocaine.

Tha Labour MP divorced from Ms Milewski in 2010 and later married Karen Burke, a Labour political activist in Rochdale who is now a councillor in Rochdale's Kingsway ward.

Karen Danczuk has also been in the headlines in the past week for posting selfies of her cleavage on Twitter.

The 31-year-old denied being an attention-seeker while her husband showed his support, saying he was proud of her ‘beauty and brains’. Mrs Danczuk has claimed the 'cleavage selfies' are accidental.

She said: ‘Because I’m taking them myself, yes, they come out on a bit of an angle.

‘But they’re not supposed to be sexy. I’m not an attention seeker. I don’t roll out of clubs drunk. I’m not silly. I’m not a crazy party animal. I’m not a girly girl and I rarely wear make-up. In fact, I’m quite a tomboy.

‘I don’t tweet them because I think I look nice. The selfies were just: “Oh, it’s hot today — I’m going out.” I like cycling!’

Simon Danczuk's first marriage did not end amicably and he has insisted that her claims about his drug fuelled past were exagerated

Mrs Danczuk posted this image of an 'easier to eat bacon sarnie' which was available at her Rochdale Deli. It came after the Labour Party leader sparked widespread internet mockery after struggling with a breakfast roll at a campaign stop ahead of the European and council elections last month

Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured in a series of unflattering shots after ordering a bacon sandwich at a campaign stop ahead of last month's European and local elections

But the pictures have boosted the number of people who follow her tweets from 400 to over 3,500.

Mrs Danczuk has also attacked claims from women in politics that she was damaging women's reputation in politics.

She said: ‘They’re insinuating I’m taking women in politics back 20 years.

‘But if a few selfies can take us back to where we were 40 years ago, then as women we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. And perhaps if women weren’t so horrible to each other and always bitching, there’d be more women on top.

‘Why don’t women help each other out more? It’d be nice if a fellow politician said, “Well done, Karen, for being a councillor and a businesswoman and a mum and getting some attention for Rochdale”.’

Mr Danczuk has become one of Labour’s highest-profile backbenchers, thanks in part to his book on Cyril Smith and the abuse of young boys at Knowl View School.

The book, Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith, prompted Rochdale Council to launch an inquiry into a potential cover-up at the school, while Greater Manchester Police is also investigating.
