It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside.

There's a Dutchman who used to have an orange glow and is now burning bright on the south coast plus a tennis legend, a £25million Premier League hot-shot and a couple of familiar faces who are never short of something to say.

WHAT'S HOT 

RONALD KOEMAN

The Southampton manager is not a stranger to winning. If you spent enough time hanging around the first team at Ajax, Barcelona and Holland in the 80s and 90s then the chances are you won't have wasted your time and Koeman's CV contains two European Cup triumphs, a clutch of Spanish trophies and a European Championship win from 1988. 

At the age of 51, though, Koeman is midway towards what would perhaps be one of his greatest achievements.

Dusan Tadic (No 11) was the hero for Koeman's side last week as he scored to sink top-four rivals Man United

The Dutchman was already a European Cup winner with PSV Eindhoven when he scored the only goal for Barcelona - a typical Koeman free-kick - against Sampdoria under the Twin Towers at Wembley in 1992

He was celebrating then and he's still celebrating now... Saints boss Ronald Koeman knows how to win

When his Southampton team started the season like a train, we presumed they would prove to be nothing more than pleasant diversion from the norm. 

Here we are heading towards February, though, and last weekend's win at Manchester United has seen Koeman's team ease in to third place in the Barclays Premier League. 

Southampton in the Champions League? Koeman's record would perhaps suggest that is where he belongs.  

ROGER FEDERER

If you want to know the toll a life on the professional tennis circuit takes on the mind and body then consider the fact that Bjorn Bjorg has been selling underpants for the last two decades. 

The worshipped Swedish baseliner may not be typical but the fact he retired at the age of 26 tells you something about how hard it is to extend a career at the top of the men's game year after year.

His game hasn't changed much but he's ditched the hairdo he had when he won his first Wimbledon in 2003

John McEnroe - who did as much as anyone to hurry Bjorg in to retirement - kept his career going until he was 32 but the fact his singles ranking had dropped to 20 by the time he took his racket home suggests he had carried on a little too long. 

Others went earlier. Stefan Edberg at 30, Boris Becker at 31. So what do we make of Federer's remarkable longevity in the week that he racked up his 1,000th victory?

Federer will be approaching his 34th birthday by the time this summer's Wimbledon rolls round but, ranked two in the world and second-favourite for the forthcoming Australian Open, is showing no signs of slowing down. 

Maybe a clue to it all is buried in the stats. 

Of the 1000 wins on tour, only 22 have ever gone to five sets. Maybe it's just been too easy all these years.

MANCHESTER CITY

It may seem a little odd to shine a positive light on the Barclays Premier League champions in the week that they were shown to have bungled their way to a succession of untruths regarding the status of Frank Lampard.

Certainly, their PR department have had better weeks.

Nevertheless, all that will really matter to Manuel Pellegrini and the club's fans are prospects on the field and it may be that the signing of striker Wilfried Bony this week has changed the landscape of the domestic season significantly. 

For all Chelsea's formidable power, it is hard to escape the feeling they rely rather too heavily on the prolific Diego Costa for goals and momentum. 

If they lose him to injury, we may see a different Chelsea. City, though, now have four of 2014's top five Premier League goal scorers in their ranks and if that isn't a fact to serve notice of their ongoing financial might - whatever the calculators of UEFAS FFP officials may say - then I don't know what is.

Bony, or Wilfried, either way his name was on a Premier League scoresheet 20 times in 2014

WHAT'S NOT

QUEENS PARK RANGERS

While discussing his team’s troubles in the Premier League so far this season, Joey Barton suggested it was time for the players to: ‘Show some b******s’. 

While such basic urgings do little to further Barton’s claims to be one of our national sport’s great thinkers, they also miss the point rather. 

Joey Barton and QPR have lost every Premier League game they've played away from home this season

QPR’s issues at the foot of the league – they have lost all of their 10 away games so far – have little to do with their courage, motivation or determination and more with the fact that they just aren’t good enough. 

Last season in the Championship, Harry Redknapp’s squad was bursting with extremely well-paid household names – many of whom had Premier League experience – yet they still managed to finish fourth, 13 points behind Burnley, in second, and a staggering 22 behind winners Leicester. 

That, really, should have told us all we needed to know. 

Average teams don’t become good teams overnight, no matter how big their ‘b******s’ are.

DARRAGH MACANTHONY

The Peterborough chairman and owner has ploughed enough of his own money in to his football club to have earned the right to say whatever he likes when things don’t go the way of Darren Ferguson’s team down in League One mid-table. 

However, the 38-year-old may wish to ponder whether his latest Twitter rantings at his failing players are likely to have any effect. 

Darragh MacAnthony launched a scathing Twitter attack... and if you want to read it, just look below

Here is the list of the 14 tweets from disgruntled Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony on Saturday

Any FA charge that follows his 11-tweet outburst won’t bother him but it’s hard to escape the feeling that his players perhaps won’t respond in the way he wishes them to. 

You only have to go back to November 22 for the previous time he took Ferguson’s team to task on Twitter – after a 2-1 defeat by Swindon – and the response to that was a run of results that currently reads LLWLLDL . 

The problem with the ‘shock’ tactic is that you only really have one shot at it. If it doesn’t work and you keep on ranting, you look less like the master motivator and more like the nutter in the corner.

KEVIN PIETERSEN

Australia’s wonderful ‘Big Bash’ competition presented us with the chance to witness a riveting 20-minute exchange between Ricky Ponting and Kevin Pietersen as they shared a commentary box in Melbourne on Tuesday morning. 

The first thing we learned is that Ponting may have a future as an interviewer, the former Australia captain proving as determined and unforgiving with the microphone as he did with a bat over his two-decade career.

As far as an England recall is concerned, it's time for Kevin Pietersen to let it go

The second is that Pietersen can be diplomatic when he tries. Pushed by Ponting to name players in the England set-up with bigger egos than his own, Pietersen declined. 

When the subject of Andrew Strauss was raised, meanwhile, he described him as a 'lovely guy'.

Sadly, though, Pietersen will continue to lose admirers as long as he continues to talk dreamily about a return to the England side. 

The former England skipper may or may not be right when he says there are many who want to see him back in the set-up but there are certainly many who don’t and that – sadly for him – would appear to include the selectors. 

Time for him to let it go before it gets embarrassing.
