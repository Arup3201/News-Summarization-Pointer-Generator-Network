Those who ignore the advice dolled out in fortune cookies at the end of a meal take heed: a retired U.S. Postal Service is $200,000 better off after using the numbers in his  to play the lottery.

Martin Fuentes, 73, is sitting pretty after putting his faith in the advice dolled out in the sweet end-of-meal treat.

The grandfather won $200,000 in the Lucky Day Lotto after buying a ticket at a 7-Eleven store in Des Plaines - nicknamed, appropriately, the 'City of Destiny'.

Fortune cookies have proved a good source of winning lottery numbers of the years

Mr Fuentes explained he had taken his mother's advice to 'play the "lucky numbers"' in his fortune cookie - and was now encouraging others to 'take someone's advice'. 

But Mr Fuentes isn't the only lucky winner to credit their windfall to the advice of a fortune cookie.

New York grandmother Emma Duvoll, then 75, enjoyed a meal at Manhattan Chinese restaurant Sammy's Noodle Shop & Grill earlier this year, ending it by cracking open her sweet treat to reveal five lucky numbers.

She used the numbers when purchasing a Powerball ticket in February this year - winning a life changing $2million.

Just weeks later, Merces Goncalves, of San Jose, California, scooped $400,000 thanks to a fortune cookie, Liberty Voice reports.

Then there was the Powerball draw in 2005, which had a record 110 winners,winning $500,000 and $100,000 each, according to Fox News.

At first, organizers appear to have suspected foul play - until it became clear all the winners had used numbers from a fortune cookie.

But what is Mr Fuentes going to do with his good fortune? It seems his family is about to have their best Christmas ever.

'I plan to use some of it to make the holidays very special for my children and grandchildren,' he said.
