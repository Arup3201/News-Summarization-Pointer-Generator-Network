The president of Eastern Kentucky University worked his way into the hearts of students last week, when he accepted a senior's challenge to shovel his driveway.

Devan Dannelly was just one of several EKU students complaining on Twitter about having to battle snow to get to class on February 17. 

But the senior called out EKU's President Michael Benson specifically that afternoon, catching the administrator's attention.

'Yo @EKUPrez come shovel my driveway/road and I'll come to class tomorrow...deal?' Dannelly tweeted.

A gentleman and a scholar: Eastern Kentucky University President Michael Benson accepted a student's request to shovel his driveway last week when snow hit campus 

Benson says he out in his own driveway when he got the Twitter notification on his phone. 

'I see this tweet, and I go in to my wife, and I said, "I’m going to surprise a student. I just want to see the look on his face when I show up to shovel his driveway,"' Benson told the Deseret News. 

Within seven minutes, Benson fired off another tweet accepting the challenge and asking where Dannelly lives, and within an hour arrived at the home armed with a shovel and a friend to help.

Dannelly, who lives near campus with his family, was out at the time but his mother answered the door and let the men get to work. Altogether it took them about 45 minutes to clear the driveway.

Joker: Senior Devan Dannelly was one of several EKU students complaining about the weather and the fact that classes hadn't been cancelled 

On his way! Within seven minutes of tweeting his challenge, EKU's president responded asking for Dannelly's address 

Hard work: Less than an hour later, Benson and a friend showed up at Dannelly's family home while he was out, and started working. He also posed with Dannelly's mom Kandra, seen above

Appreciative: When Dannelly later showed up at the house, he invited his university's president to dinner and they posed for this picture inside last week

When Dannelly arrived later, he was so moved by the kind gesture that he invited Benson and his friend  to dinner.

After the dinner, Dannelly again took to Twitter, this time with nothing but nice things to say about Benson. 

'Guys, [Benson] is a top class guy and I can not think of a better person to be our president,' Dannelly wrote. 'The man is a hard worker too! I'm looking forward to class tomorrow!' 

'I will literally never complain about going to class again.' 

He also volunteered to help anyone else clear their driveway. 

And while the university closed the next two days after Benson came by to shovel, Dannelly followed through on his promise to go to class - snapping a picture of himself at the abandoned school the next day.

A deal is a deal: Classes were cancelled the next two days after Benson shoveled Dannelly's driveway, but the student kept up on his end of the deal

Moved: Dannelly posted this picture to Twitter, inside an abandoned classroom, since he promised to go to school on Wednesday

'No class this week but I held up my end of the deal anyways,' Dannelly wrote.  

In an interview with Today.com, Dannelly said he is still shocked that Benson would go out of his way to respond to his tweet. 

'It is rare that an average student like myself gets to have any kind of interaction with their campus president, so I feel honored really. He is really a top-class guy, and I think we both have become semi-famous overnight from all of this,' Dannelly said. 

Benson told the Deseret News that he had no idea the story would make national headlines, but said he's glad it's helped inspire his students to 'help others and pitch in'. 

Benson and his family moved to Kentucky just a year ago so he could become the new president of EKU. He says the public relations team at the school encouraged him to join Twitter and that he's seen the social media platform help him make a connection to students. 

'It was fun, and I got to make a connection with a student that otherwise probably wouldn’t have happened,' he told the Richmond Register.
