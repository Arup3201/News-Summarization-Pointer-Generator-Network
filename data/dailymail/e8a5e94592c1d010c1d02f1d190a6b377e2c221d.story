Microsoft has unveiled a new 'megatablet' it hopes will take on the iPad.

Costing from $799 to $1949, the Surface Pro 3, Microsoft's third attempt at a tablet, will have a screen measuring 12 inches diagonally, up from 10.6 inches in previous models.

Microsoft says it is also thinner and faster than before - but did not, as expected, also launch a smaller tablet.

That's a handful: The Surface Pro 3 has a screen measuring 12 inches diagonally, up from 10.6 inches in previous models. Microsoft says it's also thinner and faster than before.

The tablet also has a newly redesigned keyboard case

Microsoft announced the device at an event in New York, and it will go on sale in June.

The Surface is an important part to new CEO Satya Nadella's mobile-focused strategy.

Microsoft is trying to boost sales of Windows tablets and phones to stay relevant with consumers as computing habits change.

At a presentation in New York, Nadella made it clear that Microsoft, which recently acquired Nokia's handset business, is committed fully to making its own devices, despite a lack of success for its phones and tablets so far.

'We are not building hardware for hardware's sake,' said Nadella, at the event.

'We want to build experiences that bring together all the capabilities of our company.'

'Surface Pro 3 is a tablet and a laptop,' the firm said.

'Multiple processor, RAM and storage options intersect with a sleek design that, with a simple snap or click, transform the device from a perfectly balanced tablet to a full-functioning laptop and back again — all in a beautiful package that is 30 percent thinner than an 11-inch MacBook Air.'

'So many people carry both a laptop and a tablet but really want just one device that serves all purposes,' said Panos Panay, corporate vice president, Microsoft Surface.

'Surface Pro 3 is the tablet that can replace your laptop — packing all the performance of a fully powered laptop into a thin, light and beautifully designed device.

'You’ll love being able to carry a single device for your next class, workday or weekend getaway knowing you have all the power you need.'

However, Microsoft, which is recasting itself as a 'devices and services' company, has not made much headway on the devices side, except for its Xbox game console.

The Surface, launched in October 2012 and refreshed last year, has about 2 percent of the tablet market, failing to make a dent on Apple's iPad. Microsoft has only 3 percent global share in smartphones, chiefly through Nokia.

The first Surface came out in late 2012 to lackluster sales.

The Surface 2's debut last October came with a greater marketing emphasis on tasks people normally tackle on laptops, such as creating documents and editing movies.

The Surface Pro 3 has a 12-inch screen, and also an optional pen. It is Microsoft's third attempt at a tablet.

One of Microsoft boss Satya Nadella's first jobs was to revealed the firm had brought its Office software to the iPad for the first time.

Office for the iPad, a software suite that includes programs such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and works on rival Apple Inc.'s hugely popular tablet computer.

The app allows reading and presenting of documents for free, but will require a subscription to Office365 to enable writing and editing.

Investors have so far reacted well to Nadella's 'mobile first, cloud first' strategy to recast the software maker as a 'devices and services' company, sending its shares up 9 percent since he took the helm.

So far he has stressed the services side of the business, making the momentous move to put Microsoft's Office suite on Apple Inc's iPad.

This was popular with Wall Street and more importantly with consumers, who performed 27 million downloads in a matter of weeks.However, the firm is struggling with hardware, and has just 3 percent of the global market share in smartphones.

Given that tiny market, some investors believe Microsoft should not waste time and money on the low-margin hardware business.

ValueAct Capital, which led the shareholder revolt last year which culminated in previous CEO Steve Ballmer's retirement, has lobbied against Microsoft's hardware effort, including its costly acquisition of Nokia's handset business.

The 'megatablet' also works with a special pen

'Nadella is off to a golden start as CEO, although turning around the tablet and mobile business over the next 12 to 18 months remain his two key Herculean tasks,' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.

'If the turbulence gets too rough on the tablet and/or mobile segment, we can potentially see some strategic changes on the horizon around the hardware business.'

Despite unspectacular sales, there are signs that Microsoft's Surface Pro 2, which runs the full Windows operating system, is starting to attract Microsoft's core business customers.

'There's certainly tons of interest in the Surface Pro as an Ultrabook (lightweight laptop) replacement that has tablet capabilities,' said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester.

'It is the No. 1 model I get asked about, it's going to have a lot of eyes on it.'Even if the Surface never dominates the market, Gownder thinks Nadella and Microsoft are right to persevere with hardware, if only as a way of showing other device makers how best to make use of Windows.

'Microsoft would be nuts not to have devices in the mix.

'The danger is in not exploring,' said Gownder.

The Surface 'is an important product to basically show what their overall vision is for Windows, and also to offer businesses and consumers another choice.'
