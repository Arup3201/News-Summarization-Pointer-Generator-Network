Hundreds of women in England are to be the first in the world to benefit from a drug for advanced cervical cancer - the most common cancer affecting young women.

Trials show Avastin, which is already used in other cancers, gives women almost four months’ extra life.

The drug will be available to patients via the Cancer Drugs Fund despite not yet having a licence for cervical cancer.

Experts at NHS England decided to add it to the list of approved medicines after requests for access from oncologists and following review of the positive trial results.

Professor Peter Clark, Chair of the Chemotherapy CRG, said ‘This new addition to the list demonstrates NHS England’s commitment to achieving maximum benefit to patients from the £200 million Cancer Drugs Fund.

‘The process of updating the list is led by cancer specialists, and should ensure that patients benefit quickly when new drugs become available that are backed by good evidence from trial data.’ 

It is thought 500 women every year could benefit from the drug, which is routinely available on the NHS before any other country in the world.

Sufferer: TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a public battle with cervical cancer

Nearly 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the UK each year, and it kills around 1,000 women.

Cervical cancer, which is cancer of the neck of the womb, is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under.

It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good.

However, for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely.

Reality TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease. 

The time between her diagnosis and death was just months, suggesting her cancer was already at an advanced stage on diagnosis and within five months it had spread.

Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab, is widely used in patients with colon cancer and licensed for four other types of cancer.

Trial findings show Avastin can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 30 per cent compared with chemotherapy.

Using the drug led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13.3 months and almost half of patients responded to treatment.

Robert Music, Chief Executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said ‘The addition of bevacizumab to the Cancer Drugs Fund is very positive as for women who receive a late stage diagnosis of cervical cancer, the prognosis can often be poor.

‘When this is the case, any extra time that can be provided through new drugs becomes extremely valuable. We hope this will result in extended survival without impacting on quality of life for those facing non-curative treatment.’ 

The Cancer Drugs Fund provides an additional £200m each year to enable patients with cancer in England to access drugs that are not routinely funded by their local NHS.

The national Cancer Drugs Fund list is a single national list of approved fast-track drugs giving uniform access to treatment across the country.

From 1 April, NHS England took on responsibility for the operational management of the Cancer Drugs Fund.

A spokesman for Roche, which makes Avastin, said NHS England had made the life extending treatment routinely available on the NHS before any other country in the world.

‘Roche remains committed to are working with regulatory authorities to seek a licence for Avastin in advanced cervical cancer’ she added.
