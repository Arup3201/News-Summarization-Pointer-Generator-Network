They say that a career in the fickle world of fashion has a short expiry date. But it seems that Kate Moss is keen to prove critics wrong.

This year alone the 39-year-old supermodel has fronted campaigns for St Tropez, posed nude for Playboy and even designed a phone accessories collection for Carphone Warehouse.

But it seems there is still no stopping Mossy as she lands yet another campaign - this time as the face of ELEVENPARIS' SS14 campaign.

Following on from the brand's former campaign stars such as rockstar Lenny Kravitz, the godfather of punk Iggy Pop, and It-girls Daisy Lowe, Charlotte Free and Sky Ferreira, French fashion label has added the supermodel to its roster.

Shot by renowned fashion photographer Craig McDean who has worked with the likes of Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior, the campaign features Kate in a series of portraits that are designed to present the brand’s new 90s inspired collection.

She wears her hair scraped back, minimal make-up and some rock chic gold talon nails.

The range aims to cross the border between grunge and sports chic, a look that Kate pulls off with ease.

Dan Cohen, co-founder of ELEVENPARIS, said: 'For us, Kate Moss was a natural choice to be the new face of the brand.

'Her unique style and her own close relationships with the music industry perfectly sum up what we always try to convey through our collections.'

From Rimmel's new beauty campaign to her Carphone Warehouse collection, the Kate effect shows no sign of abating.

PZ Cussons, the consumer goods giant, paid her six figures this summer to advertise 
St Tropez, and it seems that the supermodel of the century is worth it.

The fake tan became the company’s best-selling brand with revenues up 4 per cent for the six months to November 30.

Maria Malone, Senior Lecturer fashion business expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'When Kate Moss first appeared in magazines, she was a quirky antidote to the long legged doe eyed, perfect in every way type models that consumers were previously bombarded with.

'Kate is unique and distinct in appearance preventing look- a- likes and making her stand out from the usual cloned models.

'She has a natural "imperfect" yet unmistakable beauty which makes women relate to her and men believe her to be a more approachable girl next door than the unobtainable supermodels of old.

'The shelf life of a model is short, but Kate Moss is more than a model she is a brand, a British brand.

'All good brands provide a security in the purchase; you have bought the right thing. Age and time only adds strength to the brand. This will ensure that while other models retire when the inevitable wrinkles start to appear; the brand KM continues to grow.

'Her face and lifestyle is so familiar to everyone she now reaches many market segments through the vast number of products she represents; whether you buy top brands or high street. Kate Moss doesn't sell fashion; she sells a fashion attitude to both the young...and their parents.'
