British airports charge more to park a family car than a private plane, an investigation has revealed.

The survey into costs at the UK's ten busiest flight hubs has proved that it is cheaper to leave your six-seater light aircraft on the tarmac for 24-hours than your Mini in the short-stay car park.

The revelation puts into stark context the extent to which holidaymakers are being fleeced to keep British airports in competition with their global counterparts.

Tightly packed: Cars fill the parking lots of of Heathrow Airport where it costs £51.80 for a 24-hour stay

The most expensive airport to park a car was Heathrow where it costs an eye-watering £51.80 for 24 hours. However, light aircraft are not usually allowed to stop at Britain's largest airfield.

The survey, carried out by The Independent, found that the widest disparity was at Liverpool John Lennon Airport which charges nearly four times more to park a car than a light aircraft.

It's plane shocking: The survey into costs at the UK's ten busiest flight hubs has proved that it is cheaper to leave your six-seater light aircraft on the tarmac for 24-hours than your Mini in the short-stay car park

There, a 24-hour short-stay for a vehicle costs £39.99 while a plane would set you back just £10.72.

The general rule is that airports demand a flat rate for all cars, no matter what size, while aircraft are charged according to their weight.

At Manchester, the world's biggest jet, the Airbus A380, would cost almost £4,000 for a 24-hour stop-over. But Emirates, which runs the 'superjumbo' from Manchester to Dubai pays nothing because the first four hours are free and its scheduled layover is 105 minutes.

Russell Craig of Manchester airport said in the past airports made much of their revenue from planes. That, he said now accounts for less than half.

He told The Independent: 'To be able to keep investing, you've 
got to find new revenue streams and some of that is car parking. But 
pre-booking is the way to save money. The turn-up prices are what they 
are.'

Pilots face a string of fees including air-traffic and runway charges. But this may appear a good deal when compared to the amount extracted from holidaymakers in air-passenger duty, which ranges from £13 to £184.

At Birmingham Airport drivers are charged even if they are dropping a friend or relative off. There, a car costs £22.50 in the short stay while a plane is just £10.80.

In Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, a car is more than double the price of a two-ton plane.

Paul Watters of the AA said: 'Drivers will probably look 
enviously at parked aircraft wondering just how it can be that motorists
pay more when the space they are using is much less.'
