Team news

Arsenal

Arsenal hope to have defender Laurent Koscielny fit following a minor achilles problem for the Barclays Premier League opener against Crystal Palace on Saturday.

Midfielder Abou Diaby has recovered match fitness and should be in the squad, but German World Cup winning trio Lukas Podolski, Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker will be given more time after their late return to pre-season training.

Provisional squad: Szczesny, Debuchy, Koscielny, Chambers, Gibbs, Arteta, Wilshere, Carzola, Sanchez, Ramsey, Giroud, Martinez, Monreal, Diaby, Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Campbell, Flamini, Sanogo.

Crystal Palace

Crystal Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen will select the side for the Eagles' Barclays Premier League opener against Arsenal on Saturday following the shock departure of Tony Pulis.

Millen also faced the Gunners in his first game in temporary charge in October after Ian Holloway had left the club but he was unable to prevent Palace losing 2-0.
