A man who punched and kicked a 10-month-old puppy which left it with a broken skull has been jailed.

Bella suffered a broken front leg, broken back leg, fractured ribs as well as fractures to her skull and spinal vertebrae between July and October 2013.

Joseph Eames, 20, of Mexborough, South Yorkshire, was jailed for three months after inflicting a catalogue of injuries on the black crossbreed terrier.

Speaking after the case at Barnsley Magistrates' Court, RSPCA Inspector Jennie Ronksley said it was the worst case of cruelty she has dealt with in her career.

She said: 'The poor young dog sustained a number of deliberate and horrific injuries over a period of months and was in a great amount of pain suffered at the hands of Mr Eames over a long period of time.

'The RSPCA always applies for a disqualification in such cases and in this case I am happy that the sentence reflects Mr Eamesâ€™ crimes.

'Bella is now in a loving new home where she has forgotten about everything that has happened.'

The abuse emerged when a PDSA vet raised the alarm after treating Bella over a number of months and recognising the injuries were not accidental.

Eames, previously of Poplar Avenue, Goldthorpe, near Barnsley, admitted inflicting multiple blunt force trauma and physical abuse on the animal.

James Gray, defending, said Eames had no previous involvement with the criminal justice system, he suffered from epilepsy and had pleaded guilty at an early stage. He asked for any jail term to be suspended.

However, District Judge John Foster said despite the guilty plea he felt the matter was so serious only an immediate custodial sentence could be imposed.

He also banned Eames from owning an animal for life.

According to the RSPCA Bella has now made a full recovery at her new home.
