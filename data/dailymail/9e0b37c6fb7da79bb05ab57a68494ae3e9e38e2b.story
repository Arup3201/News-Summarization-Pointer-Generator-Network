If you suffer from a fear of heights, look away now.

The world's highest swing has opened in Russia, oscillating from a vertigo-inspiring height of 558ft.

SochiSwing, at the Skypark AJ Hackett Sochi Adventure Park, allows daredevils the chance to fly over the 1,640ft-deep Akhshtyrsk ravine.

Don't look down! Two people try out the new swing - the highest in the world - in Russia

Capable of carrying up to 507lb, a ride on the swing costs around £90 for one person and £130 for a tandem turn.

Sochi's contraption, which professionals have been testing since August, is 164ft higher than the previous record holder in New Zealand's Nevis River canyon.

Thrillseekers will start their adventure at the beginning of the SkyBridge, the longest suspension footbridge in the world at 1,440ft, before flying 1,640ft feet through the air to the other side of the gorge.

On its website, the attraction states: 'Who would have thought that a child's play can become such a big adventure as tall swing!

'This ride brings former yard Champions "sunshine" into a new reality.

'SochiSwing - the highest swing in the world who are rising into the sky at 170 meters!

'Since time immemorial, people struggled with their fears and wanted to fly. To fly, you need only to take a step forward! Make your dream come true!'
