The FA have backed Roy Hodgson after he made a ‘monkey’ joke during his half-time team talk on Tuesday at Wembley.

Chairman Greg Dyke says Hodgson has explained the reasoning behind the joke and said the FA backed their manager.

The England boss made the quip at half-time during Tuesday's 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Poland, which was intended to convey the need for his side to play the ball more to winger Andros Townsend.

Apology: England manager Roy Hodgson has apologised for making a joke about a monkey during the team's World Cup qualifier against Poland on Tuesday night

Nonplussed: Andros Townsend tweeted to say there was no offence meant or taken

Defence: Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to stand up for Hodgson

Hodgson is believed to have 
upset an unnamed player in the dressing room and the word 'monkey' can in certain 
contexts have racist connotations.

Lord Ouseley, chairman of 
anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out, had called on the FA to 
investigate but the group later said if no complaint had been made following the the investigation into the comments 'then the matter can only be deemed as concluded'.

But Dyke said: 'Roy Hodgson is a man of 
the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with 
the England team. He has and deserves the full support of the Football 
Association.

'He has fully 
explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players 
in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also 
explained the context in which he made his remarks.

'He
has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and 
he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. 
Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have 
been taken.

Clash: The joke came in a half-time team talk during the crunch game at Wembley Stadium

The joke, which is believed to have been told in full at half-time, is as follows.

‘NASA decided they would finally send a man up in an capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions.

‘They fire the man and the monkey into space.’

‘The intercom crackles “fire the retros”.

‘A little later, “Monkey, check the solid fuel supply’

‘Later still “Monkey, check the life support systems for the man”.

‘The astronaut takes umbrage and radios NASA. “When do I get something”.’

‘NASA replied – in 15 minutes, feed the monkey.’

'Roy has spoken with Andros Townsend 
and a number of the players since the game and he has been assured there
are no problems within the squad whatsoever.

'Additionally the FA has not had a complaint from any squad member or player 
representative, and we have today talked extensively to the squad. The 
FA has been assured by the players that there are no problems and they 
understand the point Roy was making and the context in which he was 
speaking.

'We will be 
making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and 
the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil.'

Hodgson used the joke as he attempted to 
explain to right back Chris Smalling that he wanted to get the ball to 
Townsend more often in the second half of the World Cup 
qualifier.

But Townsend tweeted on Thursday morning to insist that 'no offence' had been meant by Hodgson or taken by him.

The winger posted: 'I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was 
meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!'

Goalscorer Wayne Rooney jumped to 
Hodgson's defence on Thursday morning, he tweeted: 'Seen the story on 
roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.' 

He added on his website: 'To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day, all the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin a some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous.

'Roy spoke to Andros straight away who took no offence whatsoever, hopefully that's now the end of the matter.'

Hodgson said on Wednesday night: ‘I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time.

‘There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate.

Success: The England team secured their passage to next year's World Cup in Brazil by the 2-0 victory

‘I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday.

‘He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.’

England’s manager is furious and 
insists it was an analogy about NASA sending a monkey into space and 
cannot be interpreted in any other way.

Townsend's father Troy works for the Kick It Out campaign and is believed to have discussed the issue with his son.

Hodgson is understood to be distraught
by any attempt to smear his name after successfully leading England to 
the World Cup finals on Tuesday.

Although he is known for lengthy team 
talks to his players at times, Hodgson’s decision to make an attempt to 
tell a joke at the break does seem unusual. The 66-year-old is a man of 
vast experience but is dealing with a much younger dressing-room in a 
modern climate.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce did not think that it was an issue, saying: 'We are a politically correct country and we have to be careful 
about what we say today. But if we continue to wipe it up and promote 
everything in the press, nobody will be able to say a word shortly.

'We'll
have to keep ourselves quiet and not express opinions. We shouldn't be 
saying anything wrong but you have to be very careful today. I'm sure 
with what Roy said he didn't mean any offence or any harm.'

Former England striker Stan Collymore, meanwhile, insisted the joke makes no reference to race.

'If Roy has said that phrase in the dressing room then it is in the context of the story,' he told talkSPORT.

'People
are walking on egg shells, worried about everything they say. Why would
the word "monkey" have a racist feel for someone in the dressing room, 
or any player? I can’t see the link, can you?

'We’ve
all got the right to feel offence, but this is really spurious. What 
are you actually offended by? The word "monkey"? I don’t see any 
reference to race. You have to look at the big picture.

'Is
Roy Hodgson, from what we know of him over the last 30-40 years, the 
sort of man to go out of his way to be stupid enough to cause offence? I
would say no.'
