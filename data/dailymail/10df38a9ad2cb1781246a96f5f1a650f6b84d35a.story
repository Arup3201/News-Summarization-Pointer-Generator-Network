A schoolboy was rescued from deadly quicksands Bay this week by firefighters who were luckily training nearby.

Kavan Humphreys, 13, was fishing around Morecambe Bay in Lancashire with his father and a friend when he strayed into a particularly treacherous area and started to sink.

The boy called out to his father for help, by which time he was waist-deep in the mud.

Stuck in the mud: Kavan Humphreys, 13, got stuck while looking for a place to fish in Morecambe Bay, Cumbria

Trained: The firefighters had been practising quicksands rescues nearby when they received the call. They used a sand lance - a special kind of pump - to loosen the treacherous mud so that they set Kavan free

Alan Humphreys, 44, knew he risked getting trapped himself if he followed he son, so faced an anxious wait when he called the fire service to come to Kavan's aid.

By coincidence, the rescuers were able to arrive in minutes - because they have been practising quicksand rescues just moments before.

The firemen were able to reach Kavan by using inflatable walkways to cross the treacherous sands.

From there they were able to use sand lances - a special pump designed to soften quicksand - to shift the boy free from the mud and pull him to safety.

After the hour-long procedure, Kavan was given medical checks, but was unharmed and was at school the following day. 

Mr Humphreys said: 'He’d gone to a channel where there might be fish, crossed to the other side and sunk.

Reaching out: After an hour-long rescue operations, the firemen were able to pluck Kavan from the sands

From safety: The firefighters used inflatable walkways to approach Kavan without getting trapped themselves

'He shouted for me so I walked round the corner, where there’s a bit of a cliff, and I could see he was knee-deep in quicksand.

'I knew I couldn’t get to him without getting stuck myself so I kept my cool and phoned the coastguard.'

Fire station manager Paul Dorrington said: 'We’d been practising on a colleague who was up to his chest in quicksand and had just released him when we got the call.

'Mud sets like concrete so we turned on the water to liquify it, which allowed us to lift one leg out at a time.

'We were in a very fortunate position - the tide was well out so we had time on our side. It could have been a very different story.'

Kavan was pulled free in less than an hour and handed over to a waiting ambulance. He was taken to hospital for precautionary checks but was back at school the following day.

Morecambe Bay is notorious for its shifting sands and unpredictable tides, which can catch out unwary walkers on its huge mud flats. 

Rescued: Kavan was eventually set free, completely unharmed by his ordeal. Though rescuers warned it could have been worse were the tide not so far out at the time

The return: Kavan was checked over in an ambulance, but was unharmed and able to go school the next day

The most deadly incident at the bay came in 2004 when 21 workers fishing for cockles drowned after being trapped by incoming tides.

The men and women - illegal Chinese immigrants working for gangmasters for very little pay - could not be rescued after they were overcome by a combination of the cold February weather and incoming seas, which their leaders had failed to predict properly. 

A Lancashire Fire Service spokesman said: 'The sands of Morecambe Bay shift over the years and the shore has changed dramatically.

'Thirty years ago much of the shoreline was grass or marsh but about ten years ago the river came right in to the shore, scouring away the areas where it was safe to walk.

'Now there are many areas of soft quicksand close to the shore.'

Arnside Coastguard station officer Nigel Capstick said: 'Of all the scenarios we train to prevent and resolve, quicksand rescue is undoubtedly the most difficult and onerous.

'A child stuck up to the waist, especially with an incoming tide, is our worst nightmare, as the possible consequences do not bear thinking about.

'However, it is a very real possibility as the sands out in the Bay are truly lethal.

'We urge everyone to take the warnings seriously and not to hesitate to dial 999 and ask for Coastguard if you think someone may be in trouble.' 

The Morecambe Bay disaster took the lives of 21 Chinese immigrant workers, who were labouring on the sands at night for pitifully low pay.

They were part of a gang of almost 40 workers, who were picking cockles from the mud flats out to sea when they were surprised and cut off by the incoming tide.

The workers - none of whom had permission to work in the UK - tried to swim back to shore but most were overwhelmed by exhaustion and the February cold before they made it back.

In total 14 workers are thought to have escaped, while the rest were later found dead on the sands.

An inquest into the workers' deaths heard that the cockles were being bought from the workers - hired by illegal gangmasters - at a rate of just £5 for a 25kg bag, or 9p per lb.
