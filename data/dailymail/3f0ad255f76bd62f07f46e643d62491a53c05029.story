People living near a picturesque 15 acre beach on the south coast of England will not be allowed to use it after judges at the Supreme Court ruled in favour of its French owners.

Five judges sitting at the Supreme Court  unanimously agreed that West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex, would not be able to become a village green and therefore enjoyed by locals. 

They ruled the stretch of sand would remained fenced off under the instruction of its owners, a joint venture of French local authorities.

The ruling signaled the failure of a campaign by people living in the nearby town to have the beach registered as a village green so they could have unrestricted access to it.

People living near West Beach in Newhaven have been left disappointed after the Supreme Court ruled a beach near their town could not be a village green, giving them access, siding with its French owners. The closure of the beach has led to campaigns, including by Peter Elms, pictured having a cup of tea on the sand

It is owned by Newhaven Port and Properties (NPP) and judges ruled that giving the beach village green status could hamper NPP's running of the port.

Since the beach was closed off in 2008 there have been numerous protests, with townsfolk scaling fences to use the stretch of land and holding a 'protest picnic' on the stretch of sand. 

Carol Havard, who lives nearby, labelled the decision at the Supreme Court 'crazy'.

She said: 'This town has played here for generations. We are a small community and this is the gem in our crown, our uniqueness.

'Brighton has its beach front and we have the beach and breakwater.

'I am not against the French - my husband is French. This is about access to a fantastic place where people have been for generations.

'It is an insignificant piece of land but, to us, it is a family beach.

'I know it is about jobs and money but we would have more jobs in this town if we had some degree of tourism.

'We have a tiny town council but they have fought very hard. It is just a crazy decision.'

The battle over the beach started in 2007, when the council lodged an application with East Sussex County Council in response to NPP closing the beach because of safety concerns about the harbour walls and steps crumbling.

In 2010 the application was accepted and the Court of Appeal ruled that the beach could be granted village green status. 

But NPP appealed against that decision. 

Norman Baker (left) and Judith Ost (right), Mayor of Newhaven, said locals are disappointed by the ruling

The case ended up in the Supreme Court and Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale, Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwath and Lord Hodge heard the evidence in November.

Yesterday, they ruled that village green status could get in the way of NPP's running of the port.

To be registered as a village green land must have been used by a significant number of local residents "as of right" for at least 20 years. 

Politicians have said they will contact NPP, which also owns and runs Newhaven port, to ask them to allow residents to use the stretch of sand.

Councillor Judith Ost, Mayor of Newhaven, said: 'We don't have the right to the land but that does not stop them giving permission.

The Mayor reads a statement informing locals that the village green campaign has failed following the ruling 

Locals have been left bitterly disappointed at the decision and the failure of their campaign for the beach 

'It is in their own interests to have a good relationship with the people of Newhaven.

'They are there on the other side of the river looking for our support with what they are doing, and by and large they have got that.'

Mrs Ost and Lewes MP Norman Baker are seeking a meeting with the directors of NPP, many of whom are based in northern France.

Mr Baker said: 'Newhaven people will not rest until their beach is open to them once again, and neither shall I.

'This is a bitter disappointment for people in Newhaven, after all the effort that has been put in by the town council and the residents.

'But I want to assure people in Newhaven that we are not giving up.

Around 200 protesters held a beach picnic and 100 of them scaled the metal fence in 2013 

Protesters said residents had been 'cruelly barricaded' from the once-popular tourist beach in Newhaven

'I have already asked for a meeting with NPP to see how we might go forward and to reactivate the idea of the town council coming to an agreement with NPP.'

Newhaven councillor Cara Butler, who started a petition to get the village green application started in 2007, called on NPP to recognise the 'strength of feeling' and let people use the beach.

A spokesman for NPP said it was glad 'common sense had prevailed' and its planned regeneration of the port would benefit the local community.

He said: 'NPP appreciate that this decision will be a disappointment to campaigners, and will now take time to consider the implications of the decision.'

It was agreed with NPP before the court hearing that neither party would apply for costs.
