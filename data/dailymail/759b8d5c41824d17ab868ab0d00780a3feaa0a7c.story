Record-breaking goose has delighted her farmer by laying ten times more eggs than normal and is now on course for early retirement.

Gloucestershire farmer Bill Osborne, 69, adores his goose called Lucy who has popped one out every other day for the last three months.

Farmyard geese normally lay a clutch of around 15 eggs in Spring and then no more for the rest of the year.

Grateful: Mr Osborne is happy to keep his goose Lucy as a pet when she retires

But Mr Osborne was shocked and delighted when he discovered Lucy had started laying out of season in October.

Since then the mother goose hasn’t stopped - laying an egg without fail every other day for the past four months.

Two-year-old Lucy has kept Mr Osborne and his wife Sue busy collecting eggs through the winter - and making a mountain of cakes and omelettes.

The farmer said: 'I have had poultry all my life and I’ve never had a bird do this before. Lucy laid 15 eggs in February but left her nest after a month.

'Then in October she began laying eggs out of nowhere - we’ve had one every other day without fail since then.

Broody: record-breaking Lucy who has been laying ten times more eggs than other less prolific geese

Lucy is not your average goose as she is an Embden breed, traditionally heavier and larger than a typical goose bred for commercial output.

'So far she’s laid more than 70 eggs and that’s just the ones we know about.

'She also goes off to lay eggs by the hedge in the field but the crows get to them before we do.'

Geese are born with all the eggs they will ever lay already inside them as undeveloped yolks.

But with Lucy laying at her current record-breaking rate she may run out of eggs within a few years.

Mr Osborne, who farms in Lydney, Gloucestershire, said: 'I am just wondering how long she will keep it up.

'Geese normally go on laying for 
around 16 years but Lucy could finish her lifetime supply of eggs in the
 next three years - and she is only four-years-old now.

'If that happens then we will keep her as a pet - I think she will have earned an early retirement after all that.'

Denise
 Moss, secretary of the Goose Club of Great Britain, said she had never 
heard of an Embden goose like Lucy laying so many eggs.

She said: 'That is most unusual in an Embden. Most geese lay from February to May.

'Other breeds will quite often lay a clutch in October but we’ve never heard of an Embden laying so well and for so long.'

Omelettes: Mr Osborne and his family are never short of eggs for breakfast thanks to Lucy
