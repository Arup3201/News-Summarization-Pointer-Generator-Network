It may look like something you'd find under the kitchen sink but don't be fooled - this is actually a homemade 'drum kit' and it can certainly strike a beat.

Jake Clarke, 24, is making waves across the world after footage of his bizarre busking efforts using an instrument made from plumbing pipes has started to go viral.

The South Australian busker uses a pair of rubber thongs to bash out well known hits like Iggy Azalea's Fancy and Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes.

Jake Clarke, 24, is making waves across the world after footage of his bizarre busking efforts using an instrument made from plumbing pipes has started to go viral

He bound the plastic pipes with gaffer tape and cable ties, balanced on a makeshift foam base

Clarke's crowd-pleasing talent always draws in large numbers during his regular busking appearances at Rundle Mall in Adelaide's CBD.

Footage of his performances that have been uploaded online show him rhythmically slapping the open ends of his obscure pipe creation to produce a sound similar to that of a bass synthesiser.

Clarke, who has been a drummer for 10 years, said while he prefers using thongs to play because of the sound, it's more work because it doesn't rebound naturally like a drumstick.

He goes by the Pipe Guy on Facebook and says he wishes people would stop asking if he's a plumber.

Clarke is also currently working on his own abstract version of the PVC xylophone.
