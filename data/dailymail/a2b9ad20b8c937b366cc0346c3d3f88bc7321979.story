Facebook has completed its purchase mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to  $22 billion (£13.7 billion) in cash and stock in the firms biggest ever acquisition.

This is an increase on the $19 billion (£11.8 billion) initially announced as Facebook's share price has risen since the deal was first announced.

Facebook will pay $4.59 billion (£2.86 billion) in cash and 177,760,669 shares in the company, which have risen to $77 (£48) since February.

Boom: The free instant messaging service created in 2009 has grown faster than Facebook in its five years, and now has more than 450 million monthly users around the world. Facebook has completed its purchase of mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to $22 billion (£13.7 billion)

Over 450 million people using the service each month.

Firm has 50 employees.

70% of those people active on a given day.

Messaging volume approaching the entire global telecom SMS volume.

Service adds more than 1 million new registered users per day.

600m photos uploaded each day.

200m voice messages sent each day.

The app's founders and employees will also be granted $3.5 billion (£2.2 billion) in restricted stock that they won't have access to for four years after the deal closes.

European Union regulators approved the deal on Friday, clearing the way for the acquisition which some in the telecoms industry had opposed.

But the EU said in a statement the two firms were 'not close competitors' and that consumers would continue to have a wide choice of communication apps.

Facebook said it is keeping WhatsApp as a separate service, just as it did with Instagram, which it bought for about $715.3 (£447.3) million.

'The acquisition supports Facebook and WhatsApp's shared mission to bring more connectivity and utility to the world by delivering core internet services efficiently and affordably,' the social network said.

WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users. In comparison, Twitter had 241 million users at the end of 2014.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said WhatsApp is on path to reach a billion users.

'The combination of WhatsApp and Facebook will allow us to connect many more people round the world,' Zuckerberg said. 'We want to develop more mobile experiences like Instagram and Messenger.

'WhatApp fits this vision perfectly, it has incredibly strong engagement and growth. It's the only app we've ever seen that has grown more quickly than Facebook itself.'

'Their product roadmap is very exciting and won't change.

'Overall, I'm very excited about this deal. WhatsApp had every option in the world, so I'm thrilled they chose us.'

As part of the deal, WhatsApp co-founder and Chief Executive Jan Koum will join Facebook's board.

European Union regulators approved the deal on Friday, clearing the way for the acquisition which some in the telecoms industry had opposed. WhatsApp is still growing and is predicted to have a billion users soon. It will continue as a separate service under Facebook

'This is an incredible moment for 
me,' Mr Koum said. 'Every day over 19bn messages are sent, with over 1 
million new users every day.

'We wanted it to be simple, and a better service than SMS.'

'We're
 excited and honoured to partner with Mark and Facebook as we continue 
to bring our product to more people around the world,'

'WhatsApp's
 extremely high user engagement and rapid growth are driven by the 
simple, powerful and instantaneous messaging capabilities we provide.'

The sale of WhatsApp to Facebook for $19 billion has made its founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires overnight. 

But they are not your typical Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Success came to them late. The pair were well over 30 when they launched their messaging app in 2009.

The duo stand out in Silicon Valley for their unusual approach. They both hate advertising and have paid for almost no marketing to make the five-year-old app a success.

This may be because 37-year-old Koum and 42-year-old Acton had unusual backgrounds. Koum was born and raised in a small village outside of Kiev, Ukraine.

Growing up, his home had no electricity or hot water. His parents, a housewife and a construction manager, avoided talking on the phone in case it was tapped by the state.

Koum and his mother immigrated to Mountain View when he was 16. By 18, Koum had taught himself computer networking by buying manuals from a used book store and returning them when he’d finished.

In 1997, Koum took a job at Yahoo sitting across a desk from Acton. They hit it off, because they enjoyed each others straight-down-the-line style. 

Michigan-born Acton studied engineering at the University of Central Florida and graduated in 1988. In May, 1992 he got a job at Rockwell International as systems administrator.

Acton became Yahoo employee 44 in 1996, worked as software engineer, then senior software engineer, principal software engineer and director of engineering.

The pair stayed with Yahoo for over a decade building their bond through games of ultimate frisbee.  In September 2007 Koum and Acton finally left Yahoo.

They both applied to Facebook and were rejected. Instead they decided to set up their own venture, Whatsapp, now sold to Facebook for billions.

According to reports, the success of Whatsapp hasn’t changed Koum or Acton. When a journalist visited the company's headquarters in July 2012, the Koum was barefoot and Acton was sporting flip-flops.

The deal instantly makes WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires.

Forbes estimates that Koum held about a 45 per cent stake in the company, while Acton’s stake was over 20 per cent.

WhatsApp will remain based in 
Mountain View, California, and Facebook said its own messenger app and 
WhatsApp's core messaging product will continue to operate as separate 
applications

Facebook was advised by Allen & Co, while WhatApp enlisted Morgan Stanley for the deal.

The deal is the latest aquisition for Facebook, which last year bought Instagram.

Proud moment: Jan Koum, pictured at a digital conference in January, described the deal as 'incredible'. Forbes estimates that Koum held about a 45 per cent stake in the company, while co-founder Brian Acton's stake was over 20 per cent

It also reportedly offered to pay close to $3 billion or more to acquire messaging service Snapchat, though that offer was spurned by the site's founders.

Zuckerberg said WhatsApp would operate in the same way as Instagram, as a separate firm.

'It would be pretty stupid of us to interfere,' he said.

He also said he was not planning to put ads on the service.

'Our strategy is to grow and connect people. Once we get to 2-3 billion people there are ways we can monetise.

'Now we want to focus on growing users. I don't think ads are the right way here.'

Koum also pledged not to add adverts to WhatsApp, which makes money from a subscription model.

'We think advertising is not the way to go - we create a direct relationship with customers,' said Koum.

'We want to make the product better, faster and more efficient.'

WhatsApp in numbers. The deal instantly makes WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires. Experts claim the deal could help Facebook attract teens

Experts claim the deal could help Facebook attract teens.

Professor Will Stewart from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said: 'Obviously WhatsApp adds instant messaging to Facebook which must strengthen their position for the moment.

'Equally, all app types rise and fade, so established social media formats like Facebook will be overtaken by something new, and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while.

'This does show the growing significance of mobile, though of course Facebook is on mobile anyway.

'But, Facebook has been around a while now so the real question is what comes next?'
