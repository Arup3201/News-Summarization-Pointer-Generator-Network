A four-year-old girl has launched an appeal to raise £25,000 to help her best friend walk - something she will never do herself.

Casey Burke, four, suffers from cerebral palsy as does her best friend Matilda Duncan, five.

Casey will never be able to walk herself, but her friend Matilda could be able to if she undergoes a pioneering procedure.

Her family are unable to afford the £25,000 treatment but a fundraising appeal has been launched in the hope that 25,000 will pledge £1.

Casey is leading the campaign drive to raise the funds to get her friend walking.

The four-year-old said: 'Matilda is only five and so doesn’t have enough money in her piggy bank. So me and my mummy are helping Matilda and her mummy to raise the money.

'We need to ask 25,648 people for £1 each, but I don’t know that many people. I don’t mind that I can’t have the operation - I just want my best friend to be okay.

'If everyone could give me just a few pennies then Tilly will be able to walk. I don’t want a lot from one person, just a little from many.'

Her friend Matilda said: 'Casey is my best friend and we both have cerebral palsy. She can’t have an operation but the doctors say that I can. I love her for helping me. I will always help her too.'

The girls, who became friends after meeting at nursery, were both born prematurely and both have perfectly healthy twins.

Casey and her twin Carmel live with their older brother Luca, five, and parents Suzanne and Mike, in Eastcote, west London.

Matilda currently uses a walking frame and callipers to get around while Casey uses a wheelchair.

Matilda and her twin brother Matthew live with their mother Rachel Knowles, 41, and their project manager father Matthew Duncan, 41, in Hayes, west London.

Her family discovered she was eligible for the revolutionary procedure, known as Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy, just before Christmas.

Rachel, a shop assistant, said: 'After loads of tests, Great Ormond Street Hospital send us a letter saying that Matilda was eligible for the operation.

'They said they could pay for the cost of the operation, but we would need to pay £25,648 for pre and post-op care.

'I don’t have a problem with being asked to pay towards our daughter’s care, but we could simply never be able to afford such a great expense.'

The revolutionary spinal operation will require Matilda to stay in hospital for a week, and undergo weeks of intensive physiotherapy.

Casey’s mother Suzanne, 43, said: 'The operation is a very rare and complicated procedure which only a few Cerebral Palsy sufferers can benefit from.

'Unfortunately, Casey’s condition is too severe for her to be able to have the operation herself.

'She suffers from hip dysplasia, and has already had two operations that removed her legs and pinned them back in the correct position.

'Casey never complains - she’s an absolute angel. I’m so proud.'

Casey’s campaign has already raised nearly £3,500 for her best friend, and she hopes that Matilda will have enough money by the end of 2014 to pay for the operation.

Selective dorsal rhizotomy concentrates on the lower part of the spinal cord and involves cutting the nerves that cause the symptoms of cerebral palsy.

The operation, which was pioneered in America, was first carried out in Britain in 2011. However, NHS trusts have struggled to fully fund the procedure.

To donate, please visit www.justgiving.com/walking-Matilda or text the code MPJS50 followed by £1, £2 or £10 to 70070.

The campaign is backed by children’s charity Tree Of Hope and all funds will go to help Matilda.
