In court: Mingdong Chen, 25, is arraigned in Brooklyn criminal court on Monday after allegedly butchering his cousin's wife and her four children, aged one to nine, in Brooklyn on Saturday night

Quiet: Chen, whose lawyer said suffered two bruises to his forehead with in police custody, stayed silent

His attorney, Danielle Eaddy, said her client had been injured while in police custody and appeared to have two bruises on his forehead. She did not immediately request a psychiatric hearing.

Chen was held without bail and his next court date was set for Friday, where a grand jury was expected to determine whether to indict him in the gruesome deaths.

Police said Chen stabbed and slashed the victims in their necks and torsos. The one-year-old boy was so badly butchered that he was decapitated, according to reports.

The family was found in various rooms in their apartment on the first floor of a two-story brick house. Some were hospitalized and pronounced dead; others died at the scene.

'It's a scene you'll never forget,' said Chief of Department Philip Banks III.

The children's father and Chen's 
cousin, Yi Lin Zhuo, was working 
at a Long Island restaurant when the grisly murders unfolded in his home.Â 

Victims: Chen is accused of murdering 1-year-old William Zhuo, 7-year-old Amy Zhuo, 9-year-old Linda Zhuo, 5-year-old Kevin Zhuo and their mother Qiao Zhen Li. Two of the children are pictured

In custody: Chen, who did not enter a plea, has been held without bail and will appear in court next on Friday

The
mother tried to call him because she was alarmed about Chen's behavior 
earlier in the evening, police said - but she was unable to get through 
to him.

She
then called her mother-in-law in 
China who reached out to her daughter in the same Brooklyn neighborhood 
of Sunset Park, asking her and her husband to drop by the 
house.

When they went to check, they allegedly found Chen with a knife and dripping in blood amid the carnage.

'I know I am done,' Chen said to relatives who discovered him, according to a criminal complaint.

The children's father learned the horrifying news though a police interpreter of Chinese.

'The father was freaking out,' May Chan, a neighbor, told the New York Daily News. 'He just came home from work and saw the police and they told him. He was hysterical.

'I
always see (the kids) running around here,' he added. 
'They run around by my garage playing. They run up and down screaming. 
They're little kids ... that's so heartbreaking. Innocent kids, my God.'

Mingdong Chen 'after he was found among the bodies'

Chen had been staying with the family for about a week. He was a transient and illegally in the United States, Assistant District Attorney Mark Hale said. An immigration hold was also placed on him.

Police said Chen apparently was envious of fellow immigrants' successes in America.

'He made a very soft comment that 
since he came to this country, everybody seems to be doing better than 
him,' Banks said Sunday.

Chen was unemployed after being fired from a string of restaurant jobs he held for just a few weeks at a time, according to neighbors and relatives in the working-class Brooklyn neighborhood.

Neighbors also said that days before the brutal killings, loud, late-night arguments could be heard from the street.

Chen remained 
'bizarrely calm' as he was dragged past his family's corpses and during 
his confession to police in which he said he was jealous of his victims'
money.

He was taken barefoot, his feet caked in blood, from the home in handcuffs by police.

'The family had too much. Their income (and) lifestyle was better than his,' a source told the New York Post.

The
family did not appear to be better-off than those who lived around them
in the working-class Chinese neighborhood near Ninth Avenue in 
Brooklyn.

They sent their three school-age children to a local public 
school, according to the Education Department and Li stayed at home with
William.
