A child inside the Nauru detention centre has painted a grim and disturbing picture of what it is like to behind the gates of the facility.

A drawing done by an unidentified 16-year-old shows graphic images of suicide and depression.

The submission was made to the Australian Human Rights Commission's (AHRC) National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention 2014.

The disturbing drawing was done by a 16-year-old child while living inside the Nauru offshore processing centre

The visual diary of the child's daily life included an image of a wrist being cut by a razor blade with the words 'Suicide of children under the age of 18'

More than 230 public submissions were made to the inquiry and have come from a range of sources, including children inside the Nauru detention centre, teachers who work at the facility and mental health experts who have visited the off-shore processing centre.

The latest one is a visual diary documenting the daily life of the 16-year-old who writes in Arabic: 'We have no cameras here to take films.

'We are suffering here as the marquees have no air-conditioning and it is very hot.

'We also have no water at times.

'I want to be free of this life. This is our lives.'

Another part showed stick figures hanging by their necks from nooses above a passage which read: 'This is our lives'

This child's drawing is one of more than 230 public submissions made to the Human Rights Commission for its inquiry into the mental health of young people in detention

Surrounding these haunting words are images of a wrist being sliced open by a razor blade and stick figures hanging by nooses as well as a stick figure of a man who is believed to be Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, with phrases of a derogatory nature written around him.

The drawing of the wrist is accompanied by the words: 'Suicide of children under the age of 18'.

Underneath it is what appears to be an angel in a kneeling position with its head bowed.

The child wrote 'Everyone here is depressed', 'You cannot live here, even for one day' and 'F*** my life' accompanying a drawing of a hand giving the middle finger.

There are 983 children in immigration detention as at July 2014 on Australian soil as well as off-shore

Written in Arabic around this picture of a Nauru official trying to help children out says: 'You can help us but you only pretend you want to help us'

This is another drawing done by a children inside Nauru submitted to the AHRC inquiry

According to the AHRC, there are 208 children who are being held at the Nauru detention centre (pictured)

Other recently revealed drawings from children inside Nauru include a face crying tears of blood with its lips sewn up.

It comes after the inquiry heard evidence last month that claimed the Federal Government was attempting to conceal the extent of mental health issues of children inside detention centres, according to the ABC.

Between January 2013 to the end of March this year, it was reported by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection that 128 children had self-harmed.

According to the AHRC, there are 983 children in immigration detention as at July 2014, with 775 children held in immigration detention facilities in Australia while 208 children are at Nauru.

On top of this 304 are being detained on Christmas Island and are awaiting offshore transfer to Nauru as per Federal Government police.

As at March 31, there are 34 unaccompanied children who are being housed in Australia detention centres, while 128 babies have been born inside onshore facilities between January 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014.

The inquiry was launched by AHRC president Gillian Triggs and explored the effects of detention on the mental well-being of children who are under the age of 18.
