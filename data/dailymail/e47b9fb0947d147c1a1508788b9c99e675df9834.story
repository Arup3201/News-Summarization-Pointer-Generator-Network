Captain Francesco Schettino who abandoned the ship before his passengers

Cruise ship captain Francesco Schettino has claimed that his bosses knew about the tradition of 'sail by salutes' and that he was asked to do them for publicity stunts, it has emerged.

The news comes as the death toll rises to 13 and the number of people missing 20. The body of a woman was found by rescuers on deck seven, about 10 metres below the water line.

It has also emerged that there could be a number of unregistered passengers aboard the ship, making the number of missing people much higher.

According to details of an interview 
with Schettino, 52, he said that Costa Cruises 'knew about the regular 
practice' of sailing close by islands and it was carried out 'all around
the world'.

He told prosecutors and the 
investigating judge, in documents leaked by the Italian media, that the 
company planned the salutes to time with local public holidays on the 
islands they were due to cruise past.

Schettino's latest claims were a direct contradiction of what Costa chief Pierluigi Foschi said last week at a press conference where he said a 'sail by had been authorised just once before' in the summer of 2010 off the island of Procida, close to Naples.

His version of events in the 135 page judicial document now raises serious questions over just what Costa Cruises knew the night of the disaster and it may explain why Schettino waited for more than an hour to raise the alarm and why he made a series of phone calls to company chiefs at their HQ in Genoa.

They have always insisted that he had 'lied to them' over the incident where the Concordia scrapped rocks and that he made a 'serious error of judgement' in sailing so close past the island of Giglio - just 350ft instead of the regulatory five miles.

Schettino said: 'The salute to Giglio was arranged and wanted by Costa before we left Civitavecchia [the port of departure]. It was for publicity reasons. We have carried out those sail by salutes all over the world - Sorrento, Capri. I have sailed past Giglio other times - when I was captain of Costa Europa.'

'The sail past Giglio had been advertised in the daily ship news letter - we should have done it the week before but we couldn't because the weather had been bad. They insisted. They said, "We can be seen and we can get some publicity", so I said OK.

Schettino, who grounded the Costa Concordia, said that it was common for a 'sail by' to be performed and that his employers knew about it

Rescuers have found a 13 body, that of a woman, on deck seven of the wreckage

'The plan was that we should have been around half a nautical mile off the coast but in the end we were 0.28 of a nautical mile away,' adding how Costa knew all about the sail pasts and that they had always been happy for him to do so.

Schettino also told judge Valeria Montesarchio how he called Costa operations manager Roberto Ferrarini the night of the disaster and told him that he intended to turn the boat around and sail towards the port of Giglio and try and beach the ship.

He said: 'Ferrarini said to me "Yes...do that.." then when the ship had grounded and we spoke again he said, "At this point...more than this...we won't sink anymore," although more than 300 passengers and crew were still onboard at the time and needed to be evacuated.

Schettino also added how in one final call Ferrarini had asked him to download all the detail from the Voice Data Recorder on the bridge's black box and added: 'I'll be honest with you. For the 15 days beforehand we had been reporting that the VDR was broken and we had asked for it to be fixed but it never was.

He has been ridiculed for abandoning the vessel before passengers and one of the latest recordings, released by Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper, an official can be heard asking the captain whether everyone is going to abandon ship.

Sounding breathless, Schettino replies: ‘I’m going to stay here.’ The coastguard asks again: ‘So only you are going to stay there?’

The owners of the ship are now offering a 30 per cent discount to survivors in a bid to stave off any legal action

The wreckage is a huge blight on the coast of Giglio but there has been an increase in visitors to see the liner

He replies: ‘I’m the only one who will stay here.’ Signing off, the coastguard says:  ‘Very good, Captain. Continue with the evacuation and we’ll speak later. Keep your mobile with you.’

In another tape recording released last week, an exasperated Gregorio De Falco, head of the local coastguard, ordered Schettino back to his ship to co-ordinate the rescue.

The captain later told investigators he ‘tripped and fell’ into a lifeboat.

Officials have also said there could be a number of unregistered passengers aboard the vessel, complicating the issue of exactly how many people are missing.

'There could have been X persons who we don't know about who were inside, who were clandestine passengers aboard the ship,' said Franco Gabrielli, the national civil protection official in charge of the rescue effort.

Gabrielli said that relatives of a Hungarian woman told Italian authorities that she had telephoned them from aboard the ship and that they haven't heard from her since the accident.

People have been flocking to the island for day trips to take pictures of themselves near the sunken ship

He said it was possible that a woman's body pulled from the wreckage by divers on Saturday might be that of the unregistered passenger.

But the identity of that body and of three male bodies, all badly decomposed after days in the water, have yet to be established.

Gabrielli said they have identified eight other bodies: four French, an Italian, a Hungarian, a German and a Spanish national.

Until Sunday, authorities had said that 20 people are still missing.

Meanwhile the owners of the Costa Concordia are offering survivors a 30 per cent discount off future cruises in a bid to stave off lawsuits expected to costs hundreds of million of pounds.

The decision will be an insult to passengers, many of whom are still battling to get over the trauma of what happened that night.

A spokesman for Costa Cruises said they were trying to do everything possible to keep their customers happy and said the discount would be offered to those wanting to stay loyal to the company. He refused to comment about the ongoing investigation.
