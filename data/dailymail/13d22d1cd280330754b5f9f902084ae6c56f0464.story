These stunning lunar wildlife shots are sure to eclipse all others.

They show a range of creatures juxtaposed against a beautiful night sky and, remarkably, they were created without any editing software.

Mario Cea Sanchez, 43, was over the moon with the results after spending several months waiting for the perfect conditions for each picture.

Slime me to the moon: A snail peers up at Earth's natural satellite, or at least appears to do so in these cleverly shot montage pictures which used no photo-editing software and instead rely on a single long exposure

Moon worship: A conehead mantis appears to be gearing up to take on the moon in a fight. Mario Cea Sanchez cleverly used natural light to shoot the moon and artificial lighting to capture the image of the animal

To create the remarkable images Mr Sanchez, from Salamanca, Spain, used a special technique involving two lenses and one camera body.

He set a long exposure while pointing 
his camera at the moon before removing the first lens and replacing it 
with a second to take a picture of the animal - all without stopping the
 exposure.

Mr Sanchez cleverly used natural lighting to shoot the moon and artificial lighting to capture the image of the animal.

Nocturnal: A wood mouse sits in what appears to be a window frame. Mr Sanchez used nocturnal animals for the series and studied their habits

'On the internet you can find many similar pictures but they are made by computer programs,' he told Caters News.

'My challenge was to get capture in one shoot the moon and the animal without using any type of software.

'I have always had a fascination with the moon and I wanted to include it in my images of wildlife.

'This type of photography is really very difficult because there are so many factors to consider. The most important thing is to make sure all the conditions are optimal.

'You need to consider the position of the animal, the phase of the moon, the weather conditions and the lighting.

'I had to wait until the moon was at the desired phase and I also had to wait for a clear night so I could get a sharp image.'

Mr Sanchez used wild animals for the 
shots after studying the creatures closely to get an idea of their 
movements.

But the musician admitted the project took a lot of patience.

'I chose these particular animals because they all have nocturnal habits and live under the moonlight,' he said.

'The animals pictured are completely wild. They live in different habitats including woods, lakes, mountains.

'After
 watching them for many years you start to learn how they behave which 
makes it easier to get images, although sessions are still often 
unsuccessful.

What shall we do tonight Brain? Two wood mice appear to plot world domination under the moonlight

What a hoot! A little owl peers back into the lens against a background of a fantastically golden moon

'In general the patience is the best trait of a wildlife photographer.

'You have to spend a lot of time in the countryside waiting for the right conditions to get images like these.

'It is very difficult to get all factors in the same time. In my opinion that is what makes these images so special.'
