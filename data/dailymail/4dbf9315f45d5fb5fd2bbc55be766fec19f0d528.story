Charles Manson's fiancée allegedly tricked him into agreeing to marry her as part of a bizarre plot to put his corpse on display after he died.

Afton Elaine Burton, who calls herself 'Star', took out a marriage license with the serial killer last year - but reportedly only suggested matrimony to get legal ownership of his remains and stuff them in a glass coffin.

Star, 27, strung the 80-year-old murderer along with the hope of cashing in after he died and turning his body into a tourist attraction, according to a source close to Manson.

She had already tried to get the rights to his remains without marrying him, but was turned down, according to the New York Post.

The paper claimed that Star offered herself up as a his bride after being rebuffed, because Californian law allows spouses to choose what happens to their husbands' and wives' bodies after they die.

The claims come from Daniel Simone, a journalist who has spoken extensively with Manson and is planning to write a book on him.

He claimed that Manson is now wise to the plot - and thinks it is ridiculous because he believes that he's immortal. 

Simone told the Post: 'He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool.'

'He feels he will never die... Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with.'

Simone also said that Manson never had any intention of marrying Star - but he kept up the pretense because they would bring presents to his prison cell in Corcoran, California.

The prospect of Star becoming Mrs Manson diminished this week after it emerged the couple's 90-day marriage license had expired.

Prison rules mean the two could only marry during visiting hours on a weekend - and last weekend was their final shot before the license expired on 5 February.

Simone said that Manson has been unable to receive visitors lately because he is being treated for an infection. In a statement, Star has said she an Manson will still marry - but that an 'interruption in logistics' got in the way.

Manson has been in prison for more than four decades after being put away for a series of murders in 1969 killings. His victims included the brutal murder of director Roman Polanski's actress wife, Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant.

Star insisted last year that she and Manson were madly in love and already consider themselves married.

'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August of the now gray-haired killer, who has a swastika tattooed on his forehead.

She said she had been following Manson's 'philosophy' since she was a teenager and moved to Corcoran, where the convicted murderer is detained, to be closer to him.

Manson was married twice before he was jailed, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958, and later to Candy Stevens between 1959 and 1963.

He was sentenced to death in 1969 along with four of his disciples for having led the killing of seven people, but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison.

Manson applied for parole in 2012 but was denied release and is not eligible to apply again until 2027.

Manson headed an apocalyptic cult that committed murders in upscale, mostly white neighborhoods of Los Angeles in order to blame the crimes on African Americans, in the hope of sparking what he termed a 'Helter Skelter' race war.
