Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has accused the Football League of attempting to 'kill' the beleaguered Championship side.

The Italian had his appeal against being disqualified as a director dismissed on Monday after a Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) rejected Cellino's appeal after deciding his tax evasion conviction in Italy was an offence of dishonesty.

As a result the 58-year-old has to step down as director, cut ties with Leeds and not partake in any significant influence over the club until April 10, when his conviction becomes spent under UK law.

'They cheated. We got there and we were not able to fight,' Cellino told the Sun. 'We did not expect it to be arbitration. We expected a court, where you can challenge and put in your case.

'This was an ambush. It was a three-man panel, all three from the League,' added Cellino. 'The League are trying to hurt the club, that's my only conclusion. The club will not fall apart because I'm stepping away.'

Cellino is evidently furious that he failed the Football League's fit and proper person test in December due to his conviction for tax evasion in Italy:

'They say I am not fit and proper but I have put more than £30million of my own money into this club and I'm not here to make quick money for myself. When I arrived we were more than £55m in debt. Now the debt is £13m, I have cleaned this club.'  

Massimo Cellino's appeal against the decision to disqualify him from owning Leeds has been rejected

In its judgement the PCC stated on Monday: 'We consider that the judge's findings of fact and her description of Mr Cellino's state of mind based on them, is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest.

'We therefore conclude that Mr Cellino has been convicted of an offence involving a 'Dishonest Act' within the meaning of the rules, and that he is accordingly subject to a 'Disqualifying Condition'.

'As a result of this decision, Massimo Cellino is disqualified from acting as a 'Relevant Person', as defined by Football League regulations until 10th April 2015.'

On the pitch, Leeds have not won since December, despite a late equaliser against Birmingham on Saturday

In a statement on the Leeds United website, Cellino and the club made a short comment on Monday's decision:

'Mr Cellino would like to thank the fans, sponsors and members of the wider footballing community that have given him overwhelming support, not just since the disqualifying order was issued but since he arrived at the club.

'We are surprised and disappointed by the verdict, however we are continuing to take legal advice.

'We will release further statements in due course.' 

A Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by Tim Kerr QC has rejected an appeal by Leeds United President Massimo Cellino against the recent decision by the Board of The Football League that he is subject to a disqualifying condition under its Owners' and Directors' Test. 

The PCC found that the reasoned judgment of the Italian Court, once it had become available, was for an act involving dishonesty as determined by the Board in its original ruling in March 2014. 

Mr. Cellino's appeal against that original decision had been upheld on the basis that it could not be concluded that the offence necessarily involved a 'Dishonest Act' for the purposes of the Test.

Once the reasoned judgment became available, the Board considered the matter again and concluded that it clearly demonstrated that Mr. Cellino's offence did indeed involve acts that would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. 

In its judgment, dismissing Mr Cellino's appeal against the decision, the PCC states: 'We consider that the judge's findings of fact and her description of Mr. Cellino's state of mind based on them, is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. 

We therefore conclude that Mr.Cellino has been convicted of an offence involving a 'Dishonest Act' within the meaning of the rules, and that he is accordingly subject to a 'Disqualifying Condition'. As are result of this decision, Massimo Cellino is disqualified from acting as a 'Relevant Person', as defined by Football League regulations until 10th April 2015. 

The Football League will provide any assistance requested by Leeds United to help it minimise, as far as possible, the effect this decision has on the Club while Mr. Cellino serves his period of disqualification. 

A Football League spokesman said: 'The Football League's sole objective throughout this process has been to ensure that our regulations, as democratically approved by our member clubs, are complied with. These regulations uphold principles relating to club ownership that are widely recognised to be in the interests of the game and have the support of the other football authorities, the Government and football supporters generally.' 

The constitution of the PCC was agreed between the two parties ahead of last week's hearing and The Football League would like to thank Tim Kerr QC and the other members of the panel for their time. In addition, a further misconduct charge against Mr. Cellino and the Club for failing to supply the Italian Court judgment to The Football League when it first became available will be heard by a Football Disciplinary Commission in line with League regulations in due course.
