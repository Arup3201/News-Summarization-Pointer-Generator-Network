Boasts: One of the last images of Ifthekar Jaman, who died while fighting with al-Qaeda in Syria

A young British man who boasted of fighting ‘5-star jihad’ in Syria has been killed, his family has revealed.

Ifthekar Jaman, 23, died at the weekend in a battlefield clash 2,000 miles from his Hampshire home.

He was one of an estimated 350 British men to have taken up arms with Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria – where they are known as British Kataa’ib, meaning British Brigade.

Speaking a month ago, Jaman declared he was ready to die as a martyr, vowing: ‘I don’t plan to come back. Life is for the hereafter... it’s an eternal paradise so the sacrifice is small.’

He also urged fellow Britons to join him, using his Twitter account to glory in his hate-filled missions.

He described fighting in Syria as ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature.

Recent photographs show Jaman – a supporter of fanatical British cleric Anjem Choudary – apparently manning armed checkpoints in the Middle Eastern war zone.

Yesterday his parents were too upset to speak at their £190,000 three-bedroom terrace house in Southsea, but his younger brother Mustakim Jaman confirmed he had died on Saturday night and that his distraught family had been informed on Sunday.

He said: ‘We are in complete shock. We need time to process this, it is a lot for us to take in.’

Jaman, was who born in Portsmouth and attended local schools, left the UK earlier this year after telling his parents he was going to study in Turkey, but he slipped across the border to Syria on May 14.

Ifthekar Jaman left his home in Portsmouth earlier this year and joined an Al Qaeda group fighting in Syria

He
 joined ISIS (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant), a notorious 
group of Al Qaeda extremists waging jihad against the Syrian government 
of President Bashar al-Assad.

The
 last known pictures of him, circulated online at the start of this 
month, show Jaman and another Briton armed with AK-47 assault rifles and
 stopping vehicles at a dust-blown checkpoint.

Jaman
 – known in Syria as Abu Abdur Rahman Al-Britani – used his Twitter page
 to glorify the lifestyle and criticise British parents who tried to 
stop their children travelling to Syria.

He
 wrote on October 8: ‘These days, parents are more proud of their 
offspring getting bank jobs rather than joining the Mujahidoon.’

On
 October 2, Jaman revealed: ‘There are people who think that the Jihad 
in Syria is 24/7 fighting but it’s much more relaxed than that. They’re 
calling it a  5 star Jihad.’

The
 exact circumstances of Jaman’s death are unknown, but last night he was
 described as a martyr in a series of posts on social media, including 
on Facebook.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Syria.’

The United Nations estimates that over 120,000 people have been killed in two and a half years of civil war in Syria.
