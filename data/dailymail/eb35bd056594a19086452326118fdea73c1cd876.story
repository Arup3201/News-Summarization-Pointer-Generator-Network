Hull have announced their intention to appeal against an Football Association charge of failing to control their players during the goalless draw at Leicester on March 14.

The charge arises from a 68th minute incident in which Tigers players surrounded referee Jonathan Moss after Alex Bruce was booked for his challenge on Leicester's Riyad Mahrez.

The club's announcement comes as no surprise in the wake of strong comments made by boss Steve Bruce about the incident on Friday.

Hull City have been charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion

Bruce declared his club would 'vigorously defend' the charge, adding: 'The frustration was that he (Mahrez) was blatantly trying to get somebody sent off.

'We surrounded the referee because it was a perfectly fair challenge'.

The appeal will be heard by an independent regulatory commission.
