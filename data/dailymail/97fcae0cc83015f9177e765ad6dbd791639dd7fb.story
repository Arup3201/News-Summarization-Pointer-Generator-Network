Convicted: Trevor Cole, 57, pictured, assaulted seven young boys on isolated forest roads near Loch Fyne in Argyll and Bute, after taking them there under the pretence of a driving lesson

A paedophile driving instructor promised boys as young as nine off-road lessons before abusing them in woodland near his home.

Trevor Cole, 57, assaulted seven young boys on isolated forest roads near Loch Fyne in Argyll and Bute, after taking them there under the pretence of a driving lesson.

He now faces jail after being convicted of a string of offences at Dunoon Sheriff Court yesterday. 

Cole's victims gave evidence via video link. They were targeted by Cole, who has since moved to Cambridgeshire, over a period of nine years.

One boy said that Cole had invited him to watch porn videos with him while Cole exposed himself to him, the Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard reported. 

Others said Cole had tried to expose or touch their private parts. 

Procurator fiscal David Glancy said that Cole's behaviour was 'a catalogue of inappropriate conduct towards these boys for his own sexual gratification', it was reported.

The sexual predator found another cover for his crimes by becoming head of the parent council at the school in the small Argyll village where he lived, according to the Daily Record.

Speaking to the newspaper following the conviction, the father of one of the victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Cole was 'always taking photos of kids'.

He said: 'We always thought it must be to do with the school or whatever, and although he came across as a bit weird, no one though he would be capable of this. 

'He totally abused his position of trust in the worst possible way and it has had a horrific effect on the whole village. 

'When he was on bail before the trial, he was still walking around the village like he didn’t have a care in the world. His victims were left terrified every time they saw him wandering around.' 

On Cole’s website, he offered driving lessons for £24 an hour as well as a range of learner packages. Children under the age of 17 are allowed to have driving lessons as long as they are not on public roads

Defending, Lorraine Glancy QC insisted that Cole was innocent of all charges and that the boys were telling lies, according to the Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard.

On Cole’s website, he offered driving lessons for £24 an hour as well as a range of learner packages. 

Children under the age of 17 are allowed to have driving lessons as long as they are not on public roads. 

Cole was found guilty of seven charges, including four of sexual assault on children under 13 and two of the same offence against under-16s.

He was also convicted of 'lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour'. One of the offences took place in 2004, while the six others happened between 2011 and 2013.

Cole has now been remanded in custody and placed on the sex offender's register. He will be sentenced at Dunoon Sheriff Court on 9 March.
