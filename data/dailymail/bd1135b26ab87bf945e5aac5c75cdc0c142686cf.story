No one wants to put a draconian ban on their little ones watching the telly.

But if you drag them off into enough forests and caves and along enough rivers it seems you get the same result.

Tim
 and Kerry Meek know, because that’s exactly what they did to their two 
daughters after becoming concerned they might lose their childhood to 
CBeebies.

Rather than allow
 the girls time to settle in front of the box, the couple set Amy, ten, 
and Ella, eight, 100 outdoor challenges to complete.

A
 year on, they have just ticked off the last of them – sleeping in a 
‘tentsile’, a sort of cross between a hammock and a tent which is 
suspended between two trees.

The youngsters so enjoyed themselves they are now helping to draw up a fresh list of challenges for the next 12 months.

Interestingly, they now only watch about three hours of television a week.

Over
 the past year the two sisters have been involved in activities as wide 
ranging as making a rope swing, preparing and drinking nettle soup and 
watching a meteor shower from a beach-side bivvy.

Others
 involved caving, kayaking and hiking – all come rain, shine or snow. 
Some of the challenges – which the Meeks estimate cost only £500 to 
complete – were undertaken on days out from the family’s home in Arnold,
 Nottinghamshire, at weekends; others during trips to Northumberland, 
Scotland, Pembrokeshire, and the South West of England.

Canoeing down a river was just one of the 100 outdoor activities undertaken by the girls and their parents who are both school teachers

Snorkelling was one of many water activities the family undertook in coastal parts of the country such as Cornwall

Ella, whose favourite task was 
‘coasteering’, where rocky coastlines are traversed on foot and by 
swimming, in Cornwall, said: ‘Our friends spend a lot of their free time
 watching telly or playing on computer games in their bedrooms, luckily 
we’ve had the chance to do something different.’

Mr
 Meek, 44, a teacher at a special needs school, said: ‘We’re just 
normal, everyday people and not adventurous ourselves, but as we saw our
 kids growing up, we became more reflective as parents and wanted them 
to grow up with balance in their lives.

‘I
 think kids these days spend more time indoors than we did. They may do a
 lot of activities, but they don’t necessarily have freedom to express 
themselves or explore freely.

‘They are protected from risks which makes them very safe, but it makes them unable to take or to manage risks themselves.

So as to avoid wrapping their daughters up in 
cotton wool the parents encouraged them to take part in a variety of 
activities they wouldn't normally do

Coasteering was eight-year-old Ella's favourite 
activity, while the girls' mother Kerry enjoyed bivvy-bagging under the 
stars on a beach

'Of course, we always want Ella and Amy 
to do things safely, but in most of the challenges there’s an element of
 something could happen, they could graze themselves or trap a finger, 
say.

'Now, if they fall over they tend to shrug it off. Our girls have taken on a role as ambassadors for adventure.’

The
 girls’ social skills were also tested as one of the challenges was to 
stand up in front of their school to give a talk, and support a charity.

Both sisters were in the 
Brownies when they were younger, but found it ‘a bit arts and crafty and
 wanted something more rough and tumble’.

The family have been invited to speak at a number of outdoor festivals and activities to encourage other families to do similar activities, such as a wild river swim

Climb a winter summit and skiing were among the tasks which the family took in their stride in all weather conditions

All of the 100 adventures cost the family less than £500 put together, including walking to tidal islands (pictured) and kayak safaris

Foraging for food and cooking for Kerry Meek on mother's day using just one pot were other challenges

The family is now planning a list of activities to take on next year, with the hope that other families will be inspired to do the same

Ella is now in the Cubs and Amy in the Scouts. Mrs Taylor, 39, a
 primary school teacher, said: ‘It’s just about giving things a go and 
trying things out.’

‘My favourite activity was bivvy bagging 
[where a waterproof cover is put over a sleeping bag so you can sleep 
outdoors without a tent] as we got to sleep under the stars and saw a 
meteor shower on a beach on the Norfolk coast.

‘I didn’t like the 
idea at all at first but it was incredible. You wouldn’t have witnessed 
that in a tent and we saw it together as a family.’
