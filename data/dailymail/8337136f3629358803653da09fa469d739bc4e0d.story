A dog caused chaos at LAX airport in Los Angeles yesterday after breaking free from its kennel and charging across two runways.

One flight had to abort its landing to avoid running over the boxer dog, which had escaped while being loaded on to a flight to Paris.

The dog is believed to have chewed its way out of a cargo kennel before running loose on the northern section of the busy airport.

Its owner had already left on an earlier flight and was unaware of the chaos that the pet was causing.

Flight paths of a couple of planes had to changed while airport workers tried to catch the dog.

It was eventually cornered in a ditch along the airport's perimeter fence and, by 8.30pm had been safely stowed on an aircraft and sent on its way.

Airport spokeswoman Nancy Castles told the Los Angeles Times that the dog had broken free while being put on a trans-Atlantic flight at about 7.30pm.

The hound's escape caused brief delays at the international airport.
