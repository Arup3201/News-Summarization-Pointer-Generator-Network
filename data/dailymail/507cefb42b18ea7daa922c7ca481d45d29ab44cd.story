Qualifiers for the 2016 European Championship in France begin September, while Sky's last season broadcasting the Champions League before BT Sport take over the rights begins in the same month.

New to Sky this season will be Dutch league football from the Eredivisie, while coverage of Spain's La Liga will also be shown on Sky Sports 5.
