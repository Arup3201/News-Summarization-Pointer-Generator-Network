Schools across the  country will shut as head teachers strike for the first time in their history, it was confirmed yesterday.

Further misery for parents came after the National Association of Head Teachers voted for strike action over cuts to their pensions.

However, there was anger last night after it emerged that thousands of the heads and deputy heads planning to strike will be partially insulated from the  pension reforms.

Walkout: The National Association of Head Teachers voted 75.8 per cent in favour of strike action for the first time in their history. Union members can be seen here at their annual conference in Brighton in May

This is because last week’s last-minute concession from ministers offered to guarantee the final  salary schemes of all those who are within ten years of retirement.

In addition, data unearthed by the Daily Mail shows at least 1,000 head teachers are so-called ‘p

This will mean they receive the equivalent of £58,000 a year throughout their retirement.

Business leaders called on the Government to withdraw its concessions and ‘face down the Scargills of our schools’.

Yesterday’s strike decision was the first time in the 114-year history of the NAHT that it has resorted to industrial action.

Strike: Russell Hobby, the union's General Secretary, said members voting in favour of action for the first time marked an 'unhappy milestone'

It represents heads and deputy heads who work in 85 per cent of state primaries and 40 per cent of state secondaries.

They are also in charge of around more than a fifth of private schools, some 600 establishments.

They claim the Government’s plans would leave them working longer, paying more in monthly contributions and – for those not within ten years of retirement – receiving less when they retire.

Around 24,500 of 28,000 members were balloted for strike action  and around 40 per cent voted  in favour.

Turnout was high in relation to recent ballots on strike action – 53.6 per cent.

Of the 12,864 members who actually voted, some 75.8 per cent, 9,750, backed strikes and 3,114 voted against. They are now due to take part in the TUC’s national day of action on November 30.

They will join other public  sector unions including three  representing teachers – the National Union of Teachers, the Association of Teachers and  Lecturers and the University and College Union.

A fifth classroom union – the NASUWT – is expected to vote in favour of the strike next week.

Russell Hobby, the NAHT general secretary, who earns £148,260 a year including contributions paid into his pension scheme, said: ‘I have spoken at length to many school leaders and not one has been anything other than upset and sometimes downright angry that they have been forced into this situation as the only way to stand up for the profession and standards.’

Some 12,400 heads, of a total of 56,800, are over the age of 55. However just 1,900, currently work later than their 60th birthday.

Strike: Thousands of public sector workers marched through central London as they staged a one-day walkout on June 30. The NAHT today voted for a walkout

Official figures show the average salary for head teachers aged 60 and over across the primary and secondary sector is £62,280. Up to 1,600 earn more than £100,000.

The average head teacher can expect an annual pension pay out of £36,000.

It would cost £674,000 to buy  an annuity this large in the private sector.

Nick Gibb, Schools Minister, said: ‘Strikes benefit no one - they damage pupils’ education; disrupt and inconvenience parents’ lives; and risk the professional reputation of teachers in the eyes of the public.’

In addition to head teachers, more than 100,000 teachers and teaching assistants are due to strike on November 30.

Also, dinner ladies and cleaners and admin staff, who belong to other unions such as Unison, will be striking.

The combination will result in massive staff shortages that will make it impossible for most schools to open, for practical or health and safety reasons.
