A Southwest Airlines flight from Seattle to Sacramento, Calif., was forced to make an emergency landing in Oregon after a passenger terrorized the flight crew and passengers by repeatedly displaying gang signs, praising Jesus and demanding alcohol.

Sheron Lamar Rogers, 26, was taken into custody on Tuesday at Portland International Airport and currently remains in jail pending a detention hearing.

Rogers told FBI special agent Jake Green afterwards that he didn't believe he had threatened anyone, and any gang signs he had displayed ‘were for Jesus.’

Sheron Lamar Rogers, 26, caused a Southwest Airlines flight from Seattle to Sacramento on Tuesday to make an emergency landing in Oregon after he terrorized the flight crew and passengers

The trouble started as soon as Rogers boarded the Tuesday morning flight and claimed he had a first-class ticket - something which Southwest doesn’t do

According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S District court in Portland, Rogers was asked three times to stow his luggage.

‘I do what I want,’ he replied, the documents show.

Next he started pressing the call button and so a flight attendant asked if he had an emergency.

‘Yea... I need a (expletive) drink!' he replied.

A woman nearby asked that she and her daughter be moved to different seats, the documents state.

As the plane taxied then took off, the man repeatedly hit the call button, swore and demanded alcohol.

The problems got worse when the plane hit cruising altitude, reports The Oregonian.

Rogers started shouting at flight attendants that he had an emergency, telling one he wanted three glasses of wine, the records show.

When the attendant said he could only have one glass at a time, the man's behavior became more erratic.

'Get the f*** out of my face,' he screamed. Then he said, 'Jesus loves you,' according to documents.

Rogers then started to swear at passengers, flash gang signs and demand to speak with the pilot, the documents say. 

Rogers admitted that he had smoked a strain of cannabis that he called 'purple hash' before he boarded the flight which may have caused him to act erratic

A flight attendant became so frightened that she asked another passenger to help her restrain Rogers if he became violent, according to court records.

Another attendant boiled a pot of water to use against the suspect if he tried to approach the flight deck, the records show.

The pilot then took to decision to divert the flight and land to ensure the safety of all onboard, the documents say.

Two Port of Portland police met the plane at the gate and took Rogers into custody, while he continued to talk incessantly about Jesus, the documents say.

He told investigators he smoked ‘purple hash’ before the flight but didn't feel high. Rogers may have been referring to Purple Haze, a strain of cannabis known for its purple color and high potency.

Rogers claimed any gang signs he 'threw up were for Jesus' and that the woman who switched seats did so because he is black, according to the documents.

He has been charged with interfering with flight crew members.
