Speaking out: Denise Fergus says any compensation given to Thompson should go to charity

The killer of toddler James Bulger should not receive any compensation should it emerge he had been a victim in the phone-hacking scandal, the mother of the murdered youngster said.

Denise Fergus spoke out after learning that one of 
the her son's killers was planning to submit a claim for compensation after 
suspecting his phone had been hacked by News of the World (NOTW) journalists.

Robert Thompson, 29, who - with Jon Venables - was convicted of the murder of the James Bulger in 1993, was told by police his phone had been hacked into by NOTW journalists, it was reported.

However, Mrs Fergus said he should be stopped from potentially receiving thousands of pounds and any money paid to him by News International - the NOTW's owners - should instead go to charity.

She told The Times: 'It would be a terrible insult to James's memory if the animal who murdered him received a payout.

'If his phone was hacked, that is 
wrong. But the only reason that they were interested in him was the fact
that he murdered my son.

'If there is to be compensation paid 
then all of the money should go to charity and if his lawyers had a 
shred of decency that's what they would advise him to do.'

Tragic James was just two years old when he was abducted, tortured and murdered by Thompson and Venables in a sickening attack which shocked the nation.

The pair were convicted of his murder in 1993 and were released on a life licence in 2001.

It was after their release, when the pair assumed new identities and tried t reintegrate into society that the News Of The World began running a series of 'exclusive' stories about Thompson, revealing details of an alleged overdose, his job and where he was living.

His lawyers suspect he could have had his phone hacked.

Scotland Yard was unavailable for comment.
