The mother of a British businessman murdered in China has urged the Chinese government to make his killer pay £5million in compensation.

Gu Kailai, the wife of former top Communist Party politician Bo Xilai, was jailed for life last year for poisoning Neil Heywood, 41, whose death in 2011 sparked a massive political scandal in China.

Ann Heywood said her son’s two children, aged eight and 12, who live in Beijing with their mother, Lulu, faced the insecurity of having no financial provision for their future.

Mrs Heywood, of south London, blamed 
prominent officials including a member of the Communist Party’s 
politburo and police bosses of orchestrating a cover-up.

She added: ‘While struggling to come 
to terms with my own grief, my overriding concern has been for the 
security and wellbeing of Neil’s children.

‘Given the circumstances of Neil’s 
murder, I have been surprised and disappointed that, despite repeated 
discreet approaches to Chinese authorities, there has been no 
substantive or practical response.’

Chinese law allows for a murder victim’s family to be compensated by convicted killers.

Li Xiaolin, a lawyer who has 
represented Gu’s family, said: ‘Talks started last year, but have not 
reached agreement. Gu Kailai has no money.’

Human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang said:
‘Compensation should have been decided at the time of Gu Kailai’s 
trial, but it appears it was not. This is very strange.

‘The government can compel the sale of assets to pay compensation.’

However, in such a sensitive case, the upper echelons of Communist Party would have to agree to any deal.

‘Decisions about this case have to be
made single-handedly by the Communist Party’s top leaders,’ said He 
Weifang, a law professor at Beijing University.

Mrs Heywood urged China to show 
‘decisiveness and compassion’ to ‘enable my family to achieve some kind 
of closure to our ongoing nightmare’.

She explained that, in the months after Mr Heywood's death, it became clear that he had not died from natural causes but was the victim of murder.

'It also became clear that prominent Chinese officials, including a member of the Communist Party's politburo and a number of senior policemen, were connected with the murder and involved in a systematic coverup,' she said.

After initially refusing to speak to the media to spare Chinese authorities unnecessary embarrassment, their lack of any 'substantive or practical response' had compelled her to break her silence, Mrs Heywood added.

Compensation: Mr Heywood's family is seeking compensation from his convicted killer Gu Kailai, seen with her husband Bo Xilai in 2007

A source close to Mr Heywood's Chinese widow, Lulu, said she had been pushing for compensation for herself and their two young children.

Li Xiaolin said Heywood's family was seeking between 30 million and 50 million yuan in compensation.

Bo was sacked as Communist Party chief of the southwestern city of Chongqing last year when his wife was named as an official suspect in the November 2011 murder of Heywood, a long-time friend of the couple who also helped their son, Bo Guagua, settle into study in Britain.

Bo is now awaiting trial on charges of corruption, taking bribes and of bending the law.

The government originally implicated Bo in helping to cover up Heywood's murder, but the legal indictment issued last month made no mention of that and it is unclear if the case will be included in his trial, likely to start this month.

The British Embassy in Beijing said it had passed on the family's concerns about a lack of progress on the compensation request to the Chinese government.

'We've made the Chinese authorities, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, aware of the family's concerns on several occasions since the trial, most recently twice during July,' said an embassy spokesman, who did not elaborate.

Mrs Heywood said: 'Given the circumstances of Neil's murder, I have been surprised and disappointed that, despite repeated discreet approaches to the Chinese authorities, there has been no substantive or practical response.'

China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Chinese law stipulates that victims of crime can seek compensation from those convicted of crimes, but does not lay out monetary benchmarks, which are generally decided by the courts depending on ability to pay and the nature of the crime.

While assets ordered confiscated by courts can be used for compensation, Gu's verdict - as relayed by official state media - made no mention of asset confiscation.

'Compensation should have been decided upon at the time of Gu Kailai's trial, but it appears it was not. This is very strange,' said Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent human rights lawyer.

'The government can compel the sale of assets to pay compensation,"'which for murder cases was generally several hundred thousand yuan, he added.

However, for such a sensitive case as this, the upper echelons of ruling Communist Party would have to sign off on a compensation deal, making any court involvement moot.

'Decisions about this case have to be made single-handedly by the Communist Party's top leaders. It's not for a court or the government to decide,' said He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who has closely followed Bo's downfall.

Bo, 64, was widely seen as pursuing a powerful spot in the party's top decision-making body before his career unravelled after his former police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to a U.S. consulate for more than 24 hours in February last year and alleged that Bo's wife Gu had killed Heywood.

At her trial in August of last year, Gu admitted to poisoning Heywood, alleging that she had acted after he had threatened her son, Bo Guagua, when a business deal turned sour, according to official accounts published by state media.
