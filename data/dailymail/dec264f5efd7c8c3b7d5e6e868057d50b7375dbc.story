Mystery continues to surround the case of alleged sex photos featuring Nicolas Cage and his ex-girlfriend Christina Fulton.

It was previously reported that images of the pair engaging in sexual activity had been stolen by handyman Richard Orozco from Fulton's home in April - and are yet to be recovered. He has since been charged with felony burglary.

But now Hollywood star Cage has denied that the photographs even exist, telling MailOnline: 'Explicit photos of myself and Ms.Fullerton simply do not exist and never have.'

in stolen sex photos that belonged to his ex-girlfriend Christina Fulton

The alleged images show Nicolas in private bedroom moments with Christina, who is the mother of their 22-year-old son Weston, according to an article by TMZ on Tuesday.

Orozco was arrested on Oct. 22nd.

He has pleaded not guilty and remains in custody with bail set at $1 million.

Orozco's next court date is Nov. 21 at a downtown Los Angeles courthouse.

The photographs have not yet been recovered and the police investigation continues.

The 49-year-old National Treasure star and 46-year-old Christina started dating in 1988 and she gave birth to their son Weston in December 1990.

Third wife: Nicolas and his third wife Alice Kim, shown together in September in France, have been married since 2004

Weston was the lead singer of the black metal band Eyes Of Noctum that disbanded last year and has since joined metal band Arsh Anubis.

Nicolas has been married three times with his marriages to actress Patricia Arquette and Lisa Marie Presley ending in divorce.

The nephew of Godfather producer Francis Ford Coppola married his third wife Alice Kim, a former waitress, in 2004 and they have an eight-year-old son Kal-El together.
