A UKIP councillor has insisted he is not racist – because he has been on holiday to the Carribean.

Viv Lewis, 83, repeatedly insisted ‘I like coloured people’ as the party again faced claims it was out of touch with modern Britain.

To add further to UKIP’s woes, outspoken MEP Godfrey Bloom announced he was quitting after a string of controversies including branding party members ‘sluts’.

Apology: UKIP councillor Viv Lewis, from Cornwall, repeatedly referred to 'coloured people' during a TV interview but denied being racist

UKIP leader Nigel Farage has tried to repair the party’s reputation in recent weeks, insisting it had ‘grown up’ and was ready to win seats in the Commons.

But it suffered a setback last week when Mr Bloom told an event to promote women in politics: ‘This place is full of sluts’.

He then went outside and launched into a rant on race, before hitting a TV reporter over the head.

Mr Farage has previously been criticised for referring to ‘coloured people’.

Now Mr Lewis, from Cornwall, has been forced to apologise for a BBC TV interview where he denied being a racist - while also referring to ‘coloured people’.

Asked about UKIP’s immigration policy, he said: ‘I have already had heated arguments about that. Racist I am not. I like coloured people.

‘I have been to the West Indies. I have sampled their hospitality. I like coloured people.

‘But what I don’t like is people who walk into this country and immediately get given money when there’s a lot more deserving cases among English, British people,’ said the retired coach driver who represents Cornwall’s Camborne Treswithian.

Rob Berkeley, director of race equality think tank The Runnymede Trust, added: ‘The term coloured has largely been rejected by people from visible ethnic minorities.

‘By using the term the councillor appears to be out of touch with modern Britain.’

Meanwhile Mr Bloom has announced he will sit as an independent MEP until next year's European election.

Mr Bloom, an MEP for Yorkshire and 
Humber, was stripped of the party whip last week following his offensive
 remarks about women at a party event which over-shadowed the UKIP 
conference.

In a swipe at Mr
 Farage’s attempts to pmake the party more professional, Mr Bloom said 
the ‘New UKIP’ was ‘not really right for me any more’.

His spokeswoman said it was not clear whether he would seek re-election for a third term next May.

Mr Bloom said: ‘I have felt for some time now that the New Ukip is not really right for me anymore perhaps than New Labour was right for the Denis 'The beast of Bolsover' Skinner.

‘However our message is clear: self government. Our wonderful and loyal membership will win through with their dedication and hard work. It has been a pleasure to work with them for 15 years.

‘I shall sit out my term as an independent and give my wholehearted support to Jane Collins who is almost certainly going to be the next UKIP MEP and probably a second seat yet to be decided.

‘I shall of course retain my membership.’
