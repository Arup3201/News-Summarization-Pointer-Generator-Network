An esteemed photographer is showcasing his exhibition of images which explore common themes in advertising, re-imagined without the use of Photoshop, and featuring freckle-covered, or grime-tainted models. 

'In fashion, you don’t have dirty feet,' Los Angeles-born contemporary artist Christopher Williams, 58, tells ELLE of one of his images. 'When something is being mobilized as a fantasy image - something for a pinup context - the dirt would stand in the way of this idealized, perfect, sexual object.

'[The dirt] introduces something that helps the image to run against the grain.'

Photoshop banned: Contemporary photographer Christopher Williams is showing an exhibition which includes this un-airbrushed model (pictured) displaying prominent freckles, a fleshy side-profile, and dirty feet

The exhibition, titled The Production Line of Happiness, is currently running at New York's Museum of Modern Art until November 2, and includes nearly 100 photographs that span Mr Williams' 35-year career.

Mr Williams has photographed a wide range of subjects; from a portrait of a woman's hands which are flecked with age spots, to a sock being pulled over a slightly scarred heel, and a beach landscape delicately smudged with clouds.

According to the MoMA, the photos are 'a critique of late capitalist society in which images typically function as agents of spectacle.'

Mr Williams claims he views himself much like the magnifying bubble on his iPhone. 'You can move that little bubble around to enlarge images and words, and I think that’s what I do,' he tells Wallpaper.

Many of his photos include camera equipment and studio tools, such as light-meters and color-cards; which reveal the processes involved with staging a 'perfect' image.

'Instead of being locked behind the camera, I move around. I’m often beside the camera, never in front of the camera, sometimes behind the camera. And I’m as much a photographer as I am a picture editor and a graphic designer,' he explains.

Say cheese: 'If you look at the work of many of my colleagues, nobody's smiling,' he says. 'So I thought, I have to find a space to have a position - smiling is maybe the area I can work in'

Mr Williams also makes sure to introduce smiling participants into his work; a woman posing enthusiastically as if she's in a beauty commercial in one photo, and a grinning man holding a camera in another.

'If you look at the work of many of my colleagues, nobody’s smiling,' he says. 'So I thought, I have to find a space to have a position - smiling is maybe the area I can work in.'

Mr Williams lives in Cologne, Germany and works as a professor in photography at the Kunstakademie, Düsseldorf.

Un-touched: Beautiful as this beach scape is, were it in the pages of a travel catalog, the shadows and the puffy clouds would no doubt have been Photoshopped away
