The head of Scotland Yard was accused yesterday of failing to get a grip on the 'chaotic' scandal of shredded police corruption files.

In a stuttering performance before MPs, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted he did not even know how many documents had been destroyed.

His extraordinary confession comes nearly two months after his officers found that potentially thousands of files from an internal probe were missing.

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner also revealed he had not asked to see a key memo that summarises the destroyed documents.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe dismissed calls for a public inquiry into his force as 'absolute nonsense'

The Met under pressure: From the Daily Mail on March 22

Written by a senior detective, it 
reveals officers stole and trafficked illegal drugs, shared rewards cash
 with informants, faked applications for more payouts, sold confidential
 intelligence to  criminals and accepted bribes to destroy and fabricate
 evidence.

Yesterday Keith 
Vaz said a full parliamentary inquiry into the 'structure, governance 
and culture' of the Met would be launched by the home affairs committee.

The Labour MP, who chairs the Commons panel, said Sir Bernard had yet 
to get a grip on the issue of the 'chaotic' filing operation and his 
answers were not reassuring.

He
 pointed out the Met chief had personally learned of the 2001 shredding 
operation on February 4 and it was now March 25. In his evidence Sir 
Bernard also told MPs:

Revelations
 that the documents, gathered under Operation Othona, were destroyed 
came in Mark Ellison QC's review of the Stephen Lawrence investigation, 
published on March 6.

Dark chapters: Questions remain over whether a 
web of corrupt officers undermined investigations into the deaths of 
Stephen Lawrence, left, and Daniel Morgan, right

Sir 
Bernard was asked repeatedly if the shredding was malicious and corrupt.
 He could only reply: 'Did the shredding happen? It seems like it did. 
The question is about the motivation for the shredding.

'There
 is an innocent one – it is a normal process of weeding and getting rid 
of documents – and there is a malicious one. What we have to establish 
is which one it is.'

Asked what is missing, he said: 'I just don't know – that is what we are going to have to have an investigation to discover.'

Sir
 Bernard said the shredding is now believed to have taken place in 2001 –
 not 2003 – as originally thought. A female officer had come forward 
with details of the destruction of the files, which was carried out when
 Sir Bernard was an assistant commissioner.

Under fire: Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was questioned by the home affairs committee today

MPs heard the Met chief had personally learned of the 2001 shredding operation on February 4

Sir Bernard, who told Mr Vaz it was a 'nonsense' to think that an inquiry was needed, insisted the Met was in good shape.

But MPs were left exasperated by Sir Bernard's failure to answer a series of key questions.

They
 included whether the documents might have been shredded to comply with 
human rights law and data protection. Asked repeatedly if this was the 
case, he could say only that: 'It is entirely possible'.

There
 was astonishment when Mr Vaz asked whether Sir Bernard had read three 
key reports into possible corruption in the Met. He replied that he had 
read only part of one of the dossiers and had not seen the other files.

Scotland Yard failed to act on death threats made against the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, it was claimed last night.

Baroness Lawrence discussed the threats – believed to have been made on Twitter – at a recent meeting with Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe but nothing further has happened, the Home Affairs Select Committee heard.

Committee chairman Keith Vaz told Sir Bernard: 'She said she had a meeting with you, in which it was put to her that you had evidence of people making death threats against her.

'This was done in the presence of a solicitor, yet nothing has happened as far as she can see with regards to anyone coming back to her about this very serious issue.'

Sir Bernard replied that he would 'look into it immediately'. In a statement Scotland Yard said it contacted Baroness Lawrence's legal team soon after the meeting to access the Twitter account, and that she was contacted directly a few days later.

An investigating officer emailed the Stephen Lawrence Foundation on March 21 and 24, it added.

Mr
 Vaz also asked Sir Bernard if he had seen the devastating 2012 memo 
written by Detective Superintendent David Hurley that summarises the 
destroyed files.

Mr Vaz said: 'Could I ask have you seen the memo written by Hurley?' Sir Bernard replied:  'I haven't.'

Mr
 Vaz said: 'Sir Bernard, normally I find you very reassuring, I'm afraid
 I don't think we're reassured at the moment.'

Disturbing questions now 
remain over whether corrupt officers undermined the inquiries into the 
murders of Stephen Lawrence and private eye Daniel Morgan in 1987.

Stephen's
 parents Doreen and Neville have long feared that corruption played a 
part in the years of police failings over his racist murder in 1993.

Mr
 Morgan's family believes the same network of officers shielded those 
behind the axe killing of the married father of two. Yesterday Sir 
Bernard told MPs that the Met shouldn't be involved in any future 
corruption investigation into a former detective called John Davidson, 
who worked on both murder inquiries.

But
 he indicated that he is considering whether a sixth investigation 
should be started into the unsolved murder of Mr Morgan, who was said to
 have been preparing to expose police corruption when he was killed in a
 South East London pub car park.

Mr
 Ellison's report found that an undercover police officer was working 
within the 'Lawrence family camp' in the late 90s as evidence was being 
taken for the judicial inquiry led by Sir William Macpherson into 
Stephen's death.

Mr Ellison 
found there is evidence to suspect Mr Davidson acted corruptly. It is 
claimed that he had links to Clifford Norris, the gangland boss father 
of David Norris, one of the two men who were finally convicted in 2012 
of the teenager's racist murder.

It is also claimed that Mr Davidson had links to the failed investigation into the death of Mr Morgan in Sydenham.

Mr Davidson disputes the allegations and has always denied them.
