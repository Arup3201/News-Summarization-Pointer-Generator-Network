Twisted: Oscar Ayala-Arizmendi, 36, is accused of keeping a woman as a sex slave for 18 month

A 27-year-old woman has been freed after 18 months in captivity as a sex slave in south-central Idaho.

The woman told police she was kidnapped by Oscar Ayala-Arizmendi, 36, who locked her in his booby-trapped house in Buhl, Twin Falls County, where he raped her and forced her to take drugs.

She claims to have been beaten with a hammer ‘more times than she could count’, and that her kidnapper would put a rope around her neck and lead her around the house ‘like a dog’.

She told said her kidnapper forced her to smoke meth once or twice a week and sometimes held a gun to her head.

The woman managed to escape from the house last month, despite Ayala-Arizmendi rigging the home with electrical wires, chains and metal gates.

Oscar Ayala-Arizmendi was taken into custody on Tuesday and has now been charged with first-degree kidnapping and rape and possession of a controlled substance, with bail set at $1 million.

Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs said on Thursday that following the woman's report, police worked to collect enough evidence to make the arrest.

Authorities searched the house near U.S. Highway 30 and reported finding chains and locks mounted to walls and floors, chains on exterior doors, a handgun, and an electrical wire system intended to shock anyone trying to escape.

Twin Falls County Sheriff's Detective John Koning told Times-News the woman reported having been beaten with a hammer and piece of wood ‘more times than she could count.’ The woman said failed escape attempts resulted in additional beatings.

She reported that at night, Ayala-Arizmendi would lock the two of them in a bedroom made secure with a metal gate fastened and locked to the inside of the door.

She said she was forced to use a wastebasket as a toilet. Detective Koning said detectives found a metal waste can with urine in it.

Act of evil: Ariel Castro, who later killed himself in prison, kidnapped three young women and held them captive for a decade until one of them escaped last May

The woman said she believes she left the home three or four times over the past six months, but would always return on threat of harm or death. Police have not elaborated further.

Authorities say they photographed a bruise on the woman's leg she said happened the day she escaped.

Koning said the house also had security cameras mounted around it, with monitors in the bedroom.

The case echoes that of Ariel Castro who kidnapped Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus between 2002 and 2004 and held them prisoner in his home in Cleveland, Ohio for more than a decade.

The three women were locked in his house, sometimes chained to the wall, raped, beaten and subjected to endless psychological abuse.

Their horrendous ordeal ended in May last year when one of the women, Amanda Berry, escaped with her six year old daughter, fathered by Castro.

Two days later, on May 8, Castro pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape, kidnapping, and aggravated murder. One month into his sentence he committed suicide in his cell

Ben Andersen, Ayala-Arizmendi's public defender, has yet to respond to calls. His next court appearance is scheduled for May 23.
