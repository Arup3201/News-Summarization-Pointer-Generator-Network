Referees are not allowed to speak for themselves and they haven’t been since 2007 when they were instructed not to speak to the media despite the educational benefits that communication offers.

Now the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) have a credible speaker in their newly appointed technical director Howard Webb.

On Monday night, Webb was afforded an opportunity to talk us through how it feels to referee huge games and how difficult some decisions are, particularly in the biggest games.

He will have known that Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football programme would set him up, show clips to get him to define interpretation of law and then show inconsistencies and yet he didn’t appear wise to this.

Initially he wasted the chance to explain just how hard it is and how different it feels to referee the biggest Premier League games by claiming that all games are treated equally. Players will disagree and so do I.

Then he went on to clarify how referees view contact by one player to another’s face, or at least above the line of the shirt as invading personal space and unacceptable when supporting the dismissal of Christian Benteke when playing for Aston Villa against Tottenham two weeks ago.

Cue the set up and fast forward to Jack Wilshere’s reaction to Marouane Fellaini on Saturday at The Emirates. The Sky production team left the clip frozen on Wilshere with the top of his head pushed into Fellaini’s face with referee Mike Dean looking straight at it from close up.

It had to be a red card from Webb’s definition but instead of explaining how the enormity of the occasion, the desire to get through a massive game without a red card and inevitable controversy which led to Dean’s mistaken tolerance, he chose to defend his former colleague. 

Surely the right thing to say would have been that Dean was not afforded a slow-motion view or the freeze frame that Webb was left looking at. If he had it would have been a red card. The opportunity to educate and clarify was wasted.

But here’s the rub. PGMOL personnel feel duty bound to support their colleagues, their mates. Rather than just clarify and be consistent there is a desire to ‘cover’ for the referee. Clearly it is easier to criticise an assistant who missed a clear offside in the Everton vs West Ham game.

Of course working in live TV isn’t easy but well within Webb’s ability if his hands were not tied.

I have huge respect for Howard Webb and his refereeing CV; I like Mike Dean and think he is one of the best refs on the current list. However, as an independent voice I have to say that both men erred this weekend and one more understandably than the other.
