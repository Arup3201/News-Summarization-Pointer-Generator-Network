Pop star Gary Glitter, 70, arrived at Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning wearing a cream suit, pink shirt, hat and dark, tinted sunglasses

Gary Glitter was told off for wearing sunglasses as he appeared in court today charged with a string of historic sex attacks on two underage girls.

The former pop star, who appeared under his real name Paul Gadd, is charged with eight sex offences against girls aged under 16 in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The allegations include claims that he plied one of the girls with alcohol so he could have sex with her.

Dressed in a beige three-piece suit, pink shirt, cream scarf and wearing tinted glasses, Glitter spoke only to confirm his name, age and address during the brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in central London.

He entered no plea during the hearing which lasted less than five minutes.

Looking tanned and sporting a white goatee beard, the 1970s glam rock star removed his Panama hat before the start of the proceedings.

However, he kept his dark, tinted glasses on, which his defence barrister Christopher Ware explained was necessary because of a 'medical condition'.

He added that no ‘disrespect to the court’ was intended.

However, deputy chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot was unimpressed and said they would not be acceptable at his next appearance.

Glitter spoke slowly and in a clear voice to give his personal details, spelling out his surname, during the hearing.

The 70-year-old, from Marylebone in central London, is accused of eight charges, with six relating to one girl and two to another.

He is accused of four counts of indecent assault against the first alleged victim, who was aged 12 or 13 at the time, between January 1977 and December that year.

Glitter is accused of administering a drug – ‘namely alcohol’ - with the intention to ‘stupefy or overpower’ the girl to enable him to have sex with her between January and May 1977.

He also faces one charge of unlawful intercourse with a girl aged under 13 between the same dates.

The former singer is accused of 
another two counts of indecent assault against a second complainant, who
 was aged 13 or 14 at the time, between October 1979 and December 1980.

Judge Arbuthnot bailed Glitter until a hearing at Southwark Crown Court on July 3.

He was surrounded by photographers as he left following today's hearing, before being driven off in a black taxi.

Glitter was the first suspect to be 
arrested by Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree in 2012, the investigation
 set up after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a prolific paedophile.

Since his arrest, Glitter has kept a low profile at his £1.2million apartment in London’s fashionable Marylebone district.
