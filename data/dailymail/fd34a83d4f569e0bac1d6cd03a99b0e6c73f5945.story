Carers at a nursing home who mocked vulnerable dementia patients and pelted them with beanbags did so for ‘gratuitous sport’ a judge said.

Judge Michael Byrne said ‘weak and inadequate’ management at the  privately run home facilitated the ‘wholly unacceptable’ treatment of eight elderly Alzheimer’s sufferers.

He jailed three members of staff for a total of 17 months.

Last November, Katie Cairns (left), was convicted of
 three charges including stamping on a man’s foot, throwing bean bags at
 another male and mocking another. Carole Moore (right),  the care team leader from 
Lancaster, was found guilty of one count in which she struck a resident 
on the unit for residents with 'challenging behaviour'. Cairns was jailed today for five months; Moore was jailed for four months

The carers slapped and dragged the 
screaming patients, who were all aged between 70 and 85 and unable to 
speak or defend themselves, from their beds and threw beanbags at their 
heads ‘for laughs’ because they were bored.

One
 man also had his foot stamped on and another was nearly tipped out of 
his wheelchair during the assaults, which went on for more than a year.

Preston Crown Court heard that, despite complaints, there was a 
management ‘cover-up’ at Hillcroft Nursing Home, in Lancaster, and the 
abuse was allowed to continue.

It
 was only after a whistleblower repeatedly contacted the Care Quality 
Commission that social services were eventually contacted and police 
launched an investigation.

Gemma Pearson (left) was also convicted of attempting to tip another resident out of his wheelchair. She was given a 12-month community order with supervision and told to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work. Darren Smith, 35, from Lancaster, admitted ahead of the trial eight counts of ill-treatment in which he threw bean bags or ball at eight residents. He was jailed for eight months

All the offences at Hillcroft (above) spanned from May 2010 to September 2011 and related to seven men and one woman, all aged in their 70s or 80s, with the eldest aged 85

Last
 night Michael Rowlinson, the son of one of the victims, said the 
decision to put his father, Norman, a retired chartered surveyor into 
the home in the summer of 2010 was the ‘worst day of his life’.

‘The
 decision to put my dad into care was one we didn’t take lightly,’ he 
said. ‘As a family we were left with feelings of guilt.

The defendants all worked the day 
shift on the Coniston Unit at the home, which housed residents diagnosed
 with dementia and displaying 'challenging behaviour', the court heard.

Kathryn Johnson, prosecuting, told the court the four defendants ill-treated residents in 'varying ways'.

'They mocked them, bullied them and on occasions deliberately assaulted them,' she said.

Miss
 Johnson said bean bags should have been used as part of recreational 
therapy but they were thrown so hard and fast that residents were unable
 to catch them.

'This caused frustration and anger in the residents, whereas the defendants would laugh,' she said.

Smith
 and Moore would say 'they were doing it for their entertainment as they
 were bored' and if residents objected, they 'would be subjected to it 
all the more'.

Evidence was heard that on one occasion Smith was discovered in bed with a resident and another male member of staff.

Pearson was seen to tip a resident out of his wheelchair when he failed to stand up, causing him to stumble.

The court heard that Pearson also took 'great delight' in going behind residents and blowing in their ears.

‘This
 guilt only worsened when we found out my dad had been subjected to 
abuse and humiliation.

'We don’t know how dad feels about it because of 
his illness, but we know he would not have tolerated this type of 
behaviour if he had seen it happen to others.

‘We feel angry that this could have been allowed to happen.

‘The experience has broken down our trust. We will always wish that we could have been able to look after dad at home.’

Chris
 Haywood, 37, whose father, Ken, a former RAF serviceman, had his foot 
stamped on during the attacks, said the carers had been laughing behind 
their backs.

‘Your worst 
nightmare in these scenarios is basically what’s happened,’ Mr Haywood, a
 customer services’ adviser, said.

‘These are people I shared a cup of 
tea with while discussing my dad’s care.

‘Were they laughing at us behind our backs and waiting for us to leave so they could do it again?’

Team
 leader Carol Ann Moore, 54, and nurses Katie Cairns, 27, and Gemma 
Pearson, 28, all denied ill-treatment and neglect, but were found guilty
 following a four-week trial.

Moore, who was convicted of slapping a 
male patient ‘in revenge’ after his wife complained about a lack of 
activities at the home, was jailed for four months.

Cairns,
 who stamped on Mr  Haywood’s foot, threw beanbags at residents and 
taunted an elderly man by pulling loose skin on his neck, was jailed for
 five months.

Pearson, who 
tried to tip a patient out of his wheelchair when he refused to stand 
up, was given a 12-month community order and ordered to carry out 40 
hours of unpaid work.

A fourth carer,  Darren Smith, 35,  who threw 
beanbags at residents, admitted ill-treatment ahead of the trial and was
 jailed for eight months.

Management at the home ruled there was insufficient evidence for a wider investigation and failed to pass on the complaints to social services

Judge
 Byrne told the carers: ‘The offences you committed were carried out as a
 gratuitous sport at the expense of vulnerable victims.

‘Victims
 of dementia are extremely vulnerable and susceptible to others. Their 
quality of daily life is dependent on the help of others.

‘Each
 of these defendants deliberately broke the trust placed in them. Any 
deliberate act of ill treatment is wholly unacceptable.’

All the offences occurred between May 2010 and September 2011.

'Worst day of our lives': Families' anger at relatives' treatment

Relatives of the ill-treated elderly dementia sufferers have spoken of their heartbreak and anger.

One son of a victim chose to enter the witness box to give his statement in person.

Michael Rawlinson said his family’s decision to place his father, Norman, a retired chartered surveyor, into care was the 'worst day of our lives'.

He said that decision was not taken lightly because his father, married for 57 years, had Alzheimer’s and was unable to give his opinion.

He said: 'We had feelings of guilt for not being able to look after him.

'Our feelings of guilt only worsened when we found out that Dad had been subjected to humiliation and ill-treatment by those who were trusted to care for him.

'We feel angry this could have been allowed to happen to Dad and sorry that Mum had to learn about it.”

He said evidence heard at the trial had 'saddened us greatly'.

Mr Rawlinson said a clear signal had to be sent by the courts that such behaviour could not be tolerated.

He asked: 'What sort of human being treats another with such disrepect?'

He added that he thought it was clear that management at Hillcroft had covered up the incidents and that they and the owners had failed to ensure the safety of the residents.

Mr Rawlinson said he did not believe the Care and Quality Commission (CQC) had held Hillcroft to account.

He said he was still awaiting formal apologies from the defendants and Hillcroft’s management and directors.

The prosecutor read out statements from other relatives.

A daughter of one victim said she was 'devastated' when she was informed of the abuse.

'She has felt a huge amount of guilt because she had moved her father to the home because she thought it was the better place to be in,' she said.

Another relative described how she was informed of the abuse against her mother.

'To receive a letter and to be informed that your parent has possibly been physically abused in a place that is thought to be comfortable for them is heartbreaking,' she said.

She said she wanted to know why the defendants had acted like they did and what they would think if their parents were treated in the same manner.

The son of the man whose foot was stamped on also thanked whistleblowers in the case who were 'brave enough' to come forward.

The wife of another victim described feeling that members of staff had been 'laughing at the families behind their backs' and that the carers had abused her trust.

Judge Byrne said three common themes emerged from the statements given by families.

He said: 'In each and every case, the victim’s family trusted the home to look after their relative.

'Secondly, many of the families felt a sense of guilt of having to give up the care of one of their family to be cared for by strangers.

'And thirdly, the anger and resentment at the trust being betrayed.'
