A lawyer who helped Shrien Dewani walk free from charges relating to the honeymoon murder of his bride, has been secured to represent a 20 year old South African who survived an axe massacre of his family.

Henri van Breda was treated for minor injuries following the brutal triple murder of his parents and older brother. His 16 year old sister is fighting for her life with a round the clock police guard.

According to reports, the physics student waited four hours before alerting emergency services to the shocking blood bath at his family's luxury home near Cape Town, a week ago.

Barrister Pieter Botha – whose savage cross-examination style helped dismantle the state's case against bisexual Mr Dewani who was on trial for the contract killing of his Swedish wife, Anni – has consulted with Henri, who is being looked after by relatives who have vowed to 'stand by him no matter what'.

'The family think that it is prudent at this time to appoint an expert legal team and there has been a consultation,' family spokesman Ben Rootman told Mailonline.

Mr Dewani, 34, was freed in December on all charges relating to the fatal shooting of his bride of two weeks during their honeymoon to Cape Town in 2010, after Mr Botha, and a colleague, successfully argued that the case against him should be thrown out.

A close family friend described the van Bredas as 'like a perfect family'

Mr Botha, who has spent more than two decades at the South African bar, has defended some of the country's most high profile cases. He is feared by expert witnesses for his confrontational, flamboyant questioning of witnesses. During Mr Dewani's trial, which followed the businessman's three year battle against extradition to South Africa, Mr Botha forced the state's ballistics expert to concede almost every point of his report to the court.

Police are waiting to question schoolgirl Marli, who is the only other surviving witness to the appalling attack, a week ago, but it will be sometime until she is in a fit state to provide any information. She is being treated for severe head injuries, including a severed jugular vein after undergoing emergency brain surgery. She is now in a 'stable' condition, but can only communicate by blinking.

According to one report in a South African newspaper, a police doctor had found Henri's own minor injuries to have been 'self-inflicted' despite telling police how his family were attacked by 'two or three men' wielding an axe.

Post mortems on the three dead family members – Martin, 54, his wife Teresa, 55 and their son Rudi, 22 – found they had been killed at around 3am, four hours before Henri made a phone call for help.

Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call

In the five-minute phone call from his mobile, Henri appears remarkably calm, but at one point appears to stifle a giggle during the call from the exclusive high-security golf-estate where the family lived in the winelands outside Cape Town.

According to police sources, Henri told investigators that he was in an upstairs bathroom at the wealthy family's home at De Zalze estate, in Stellenbosch in the early hours of last Tuesday morning when intruders attacked his family.

He described how an unknown killer first hacked to death his brother, Rudi, 'with tremendous strength with an axe'.

Survivor: The attackers left Marli (pictured) with a cut throat and 'severe' head injuries on the balcony of her home in Stellenbosch - 50 kilometres east of Cape Town. She has started blinking in reacting to questions from investigators officers

 

According to his account to police, father Martin rushed to defend his older son, but was cut down as by the killer. Mother, Teresa, was the next to be murdered, while Marli somehow survived appalling injuries. Henri said in his interview with investigators that he was 'knocked out cold' and the attacker 'threw the axe at him'.

When he regained consciousness, he phoned police on his mobile, just after 7.30am last Tuesday. According to his phone records, Henri surfed the internet twice before phoning for help.

Reports claim he appeared confused about times and dates, but was calm and composed when recounting events to police, apart from he was asked about his sister when he became distressed.

Tributes: Relatives say Henri was at a memorial service held in Pretoria for his family including brother Rudi (right) last week but was kept away from reporters

Henri was not seen at the memorial service held in Pretoria for his family last week, but relatives insist he had been present, but was kept hidden from reporters. 

The van Breda family had only moved back to South Africa from Australia last year. It was while in the South African capital, that Henri had met his solicitor Lorida van Niekerk, who will be working alongside Mr Botha.
