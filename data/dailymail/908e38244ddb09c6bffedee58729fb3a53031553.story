US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson’s frustration was rendered complete on Sunday night when Billy Horschel produced a brilliant performance to upstage Rory McIlroy and land himself an $11.44 million (£7m) payday.

The 27-year-old American followed up his win in the BMW Championship last week by claiming the Tour Championship from under the nose of the Northern Irishman, which in turn earned him the $10 million (£6.15m) bonus for the FedEx Cup play-off series spanning four tournaments.

Almost $13 million (£8m) earned in eight days then, and his wife is due to give birth to their first child any day. How’s that for a life-changing fortnight?

Horschel shot a final round 68 to win by three shots from fellow American Jim Furyk and McIlroy, with Chris Kirk, Justin Rose and Jason Day a further shot adrift.

Horschel and Kirk finished 1-2 in the FedEx and are just what any Ryder Cup team is looking for, two men in the form of their lives. The problem for Watson, of course, is that neither will be at Gleneagles next week.

McIlroy said on Saturday Watson must be kicking himself at the turn of events last week. He looked like he was about to say a lot more besides when he probably saw headlines appearing before his eyes and stopped himself.

Certainly the play of Horschel and Kirk stood in stark contrast to that of Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson, Watson’s two wild cards who were competing.

Asked about Horschel in particular, McIlroy replied: ‘You know, I’m sure Tom Watson is sitting at home kicking himself at the minute with some of the ... but anyways, he’s playing great. That’s another story.’

The skipper’s discomfort continued right to the end as Horschel pulled off a series of dazzling strokes and holed some nerve-wracking putts for a success he thoroughly deserved. ‘Why didn’t you play like this earlier?’ was the text an exasperated Watson sent him on Friday night. What on earth must he be thinking now?

The key moment came at the 16th. Horschel was just a shot ahead of Furyk and looked likely to drop a stroke but holed a gutsy 20 footer for par. ‘That was the golf tournament, right there,’ said Horschel.

There was a nice scene at the end as McIlroy embraced the winner on the 18th green. They had their differences once at the 2007 Walker Cup but that has long since been resolved and here they showed a mutual respect.

‘I’ve shown I can go toe to toe with the best player in the world and come out on top, and that’s going to be huge for me going forward,’ said Horschel.

McIloy’s bid for his own £11.4 million payday to go with his priceless major championship wins over the summer fizzled out over the first 12 holes.

After playing 25 of his last 27 rounds under par, it looked like 18 holes too far as he made a series of wild errors to fall from contention. He did rally with three birdies in a row from the 15th but was never going to catch Horschel. Still, third place in the FedEx earned him a tidy $2 million bonus to go with all the other riches he has claimed this year.

As for Simpson and Mahan, they finished the week in tied 23rd place in a 29 man field after neither broke par in any round. They’ll certainly be under pressure to deliver at Gleneagles

Meanwhile, at the KLM Open on the European Tour, Paul Casey lived up the old adage of noted golfing author Keith Elliott that players in their thirties who have just fathered a male child are more likely to win by claiming his 13th tour victory - but his first since becoming a parent.

The 37 year old Englishman shot wonderful rounds of 62-66 at the weekend to win by a stroke from fellow countryman Simon Dyson, with two more compatriots rounding out the top four – Andy Sullivan and Eddie Pepperell.

‘First tournament as a dad and first win as a dad,’ said an emotional Casey, whose wife Polyanna gave birth to their son on Sept 1.
