Rape victims were left traumatised after their attackers sent them threatening letters from their prison cells.

Nicola Richardson and Jemma Myhill received ‘hostile’ letters written by their rapists while they were in prison.

Last night the women, who have waived their right to anonymity, said they had been failed by a flawed victim protection system which should have kept them safe.

Miss Myhill, now 19, was raped and sexually abused by her 44-year-old uncle Darren Myhill between the ages of eight and 16.

Her attacker was jailed in March 2013 after admitting 22 charges of rape, indecency with a child, indecent assault and incitement against five children.

Shocking: Nicola Richardson, 34, whose husband Wayne Scott was jailed for 19 years for raping her, together left, and Jemma Myhill, who was raped by her uncle, have been receiving unwanted letters from their attackers

But only a 
few weeks after he was jailed, Miss Myhill, from Newcastle upon Tyne, 
received a hand-written letter from Holme House Prison in 
Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham.

She said: 
‘A few weeks after Darren was sent to prison I was at home when I heard 
the letter box clatter. I walked over to the front door to pick up the 
letters.

‘One of the
 letters was addressed to me and it bared a prison stamp. I ripped open 
the envelope, skimmed over the writing and started to scream. I grabbed 
my phone from my pocket and rang my mam. Darren had sent me a letter 
from prison.

‘He had written to me telling me he knew which pubs I had been in and who I had been with. I felt sick to my stomach.’

Her mother 
Julie Myhill also received a letter from the prisoner, suggesting that 
she had been to blame for her daughter ‘going off the rails’.

She quickly rang the probation service and they promised to step in to stop any more letters being sent to the house.

Mrs Myhill 
said: ‘The prison tried to suggest that the letters might have been 
smuggled out, but they had the prison stamp. We still haven’t received 
any apology from the prison.’

Trauma: Jemma's letters from her abusive uncle said he knew where she had been going after he was jailed

Disgraced: Written on prison paper, her uncle was able to tell her he loved her and that he wanted to kill himself

Jemma's mother Julie, who ensured her daughter's attacker had his sentenced increased, also received letters

Mrs 
Richardson, who also received letters from her attacker, said: ‘I have 
been told by police that prisons have lists of people inmates are not 
allowed to  contact, but there are obviously flaws in the system.

‘I am disgusted that this happened at a time when I was  particularly vulnerable.’

Mrs Richardson was repeatedly raped by her husband Wayne Scott, a policeman, who has since been jailed for 19 years.

Serial child rapist Darren Myhill, 44, persistantly posted letters from prison to one of his victims - his neice'

But he was able to send 34-year-old Mrs Richardson at least three letters during his time in prison.

The first letter was sent from Armley in Leeds where Scott, who has two children with his victim, was being held on remand.

Mrs 
Richardson received it in the summer of last year just a few months 
after Scott was arrested. She said: ‘I had recognised the handwriting on
 the envelope straight away. I felt sick. I couldn’t believe this had 
been allowed to happen.’ Mrs Richardson, also from Stockton-on-Tees, 
passed the letter on to police and assumed that it would be the last 
time she heard from her husband.

But she 
received two more letters while Scott was being held in Leeds and then a
 hostile one from Durham Prison where he was sent after his conviction.

Prisoners have a legal right to send and receive letters in jail but their communications are supposed to be checked.

Any inmates
 wishing to correspond with their victims must apply to the prison 
governor for permission to do so – who should in turn get in touch with 
victim liaison officers before any letters leave the prison.

A Prison 
Service spokesman said: ‘There are very strict rules governing 
correspondence and contact between offenders and their victims.

‘Any breach of these rules is unacceptable and will be dealt with swiftly and robustly.’

But Adam 
Pemberton, assistant chief executive of Victim Support, said: ‘Something
 has gone wrong here – this kind of contact is not supposed to happen.
