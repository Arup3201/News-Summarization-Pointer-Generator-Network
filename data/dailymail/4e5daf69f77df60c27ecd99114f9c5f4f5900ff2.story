Bailed: Heavily pregnant Josie Connors arrives at Luton Magistrates' Court today

A 30-year-old pregnant woman charged with slavery offences was granted bail when she appeared in court today.

Josie Connors made a short appearance at Luton Magistrates' Court charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit offences of holding people in servitude and two counts of requiring people to perform forced labour, Bedfordshire Police said.

She was granted conditional bail by Luton Magistrates to reappear at Luton Crown Court on December 5 along with five men who have also been charged with offences in relation to the Greenacres travellers' site, near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, which was raided by police on September 11.

Yesterday, Johnny Connors, 30, was 
remanded in custody after appearing in front of magistrates charged with
one count of conspiracy to hold someone in servitude and one count of 
conspiracy to require someone to perform forced labour.

Connors is another brother of the three Connor brothers - part of an Irish traveller clan - who appeared in front of magistrates last week.

Last week, brothers James, (Jimmy), 23, Tommy, 27, and 
Patrick Connors, 19, were formally accused 
of torturing, beating, punching and humiliating four homeless men at 
their caravan site home and making them carry out hard 
labour, 'in the place of industrial machines', for no pay.

Their brother-in-law, James (Big Jim) 
Connors, 33, was also in the dock charged with slavery offences and 
remanded to reappear at Luton Crown Court.

He faces three charges of slavery (holding men in 
servitude) and three charges of forced labour (forcing men to carry out 
work without pay), under section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 
2009.

Magistrates were last week told the alleged victims 
were forced to live in cramped conditions with little food or heating 
and required to work digging roads, laying tarmac and paving for six 
days a week for no pay.

When they were not working for money the slavery victims were forced to clean the Connors’ homes.

Twenty-four men were found by police in the raid and taken from the site and into safety.

The raid followed numerous reports that men were being held against their will at the site.

Two
other people, a 61-year-old woman and a 51-year-old man, have also been
arrested after agreeing to go to Luton police station to talk to 
officers.

The woman remains in custody while the man was released on police bail pending medical treatment for an ongoing condition.
