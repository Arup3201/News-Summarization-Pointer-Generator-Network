Halloween is known for its typical American themes of cats, witches and pumpkin lanterns. 

But move further south and the festival of All Hallows' Eve is somewhat less commercial and brings colour and depth to the morbid holiday.

Day Of The Dead (Día de Muertos) originated as an Aztec tradition in Mexico, celebrating the lives of the deceased through preparing sugar skulls, marigolds and  their favourite food and drinks over three days (October 31 - November 2).

These are historically brought to a loved one's  grave, which can be decorated, to pay homage to a deceased relative - a tradition based on Mexico's pre-Hispanic culture.

In modern times the Day Of The Dead's themes are adopted in many countries and cultures and is an increasingly popular fancy dress and party theme in the UK.

The Lady Of The Dead, or La Calavera Nicole (or the Elegant Skeleton), is an early 1900s image by Mexican artist José Guadalupe Posada depicting a female skeleton dressed in an upper class hat. 

She started life as a satirical portrait of Mexicans who hoped to adopt European aristocratic traditions in the pre-revolutionary era, according to the artist. 

Nowadays, she has become known as La Catrina, or Catrina, an icon of Día de Muertos, and one of the most popular ways women dress for the occasion. 

In 2012, Guadalupe Posada's painting celebrated 100 years.

Kate Moss dressed up as a variation of Catrina for Jonathan Ross's famous Halloween party last October, weeks after Sandra Bullock stepped out in a similar, expertly executed outfit.

Pinterest held a Day Of The Dead themed styling event at Mexican eaterie Wahaca, Soho, taking the most pinned looks from the site then teaching pinners how to recreate them.

Femail writer Deni Kirkova got the full makeover and a one-to-one with each beautifying expert. We now bring you the low-down on how to get a gorgeous Catrina-inspired look at home this Halloween.

STEP ONE: HAIR

Victory rolls or indeed almost any voluminous hair style from the 1940s involving curls and pins will work wonder with a marigold headdress and a beautifully made-up face.

I was styled by the wonderful girls from Hoxton hair salon Rockalily. ReeRee talked me through how to recreate victory roll hairstyle at home.

Steps:

1. Curl all your hair, then section a portion of it. For the victory rolls, grab the hair from behind your ear.

2. The victory roll needs a base to sit on, which you can created here with some good back combing. Spray to seal.

3. Roll the hair. You can either use your finger, your thumb, or even just by pinching it into shape. Try and find what works best for you.

4. At this stage you may want to play around with different placement ideas for the roll.

5. Pin the victory roll into place using a pins, using between 2-5 pins per roll.

6. Repeat on the other side! If there's a fringe, you can add another roll at the front - position them wide or high to suit and flatter your face shape.

7. Pin faux marigolds or roses as you please.

If you're planning on taking a food break - now's the time, after the hair but before all the face paint!

We feasted on tortillas with guacamole and refried beans, pork tacos and churros - heavenly

STEP TWO: FACE

The make-up look was created by London Body Painting's Sarah. 

She used water-base face paints with sponges and brushes, choosing a pastel colour theme face for me. It was a soft pretty look quite different from the black and red colour Catrina faces seen so often.

What you'll need:

- Pale foundation or white face paint

- Turquoise face paint or eyeshadow

- Pink blusher

- Black face paint or liquid eyeliner

- Sponge and some makeup brushes

After the base and contouring, draw a circle around each eye in turquoise and fill it in, then add small lines

Steps:

1. Apply white (or mint) base to face leaving the eyes. Sponge on face shaping such as sullen, sculpted cheekbones for a real skull look (even though it's still pretty!)

2. Draw a circle around each eye in turquoise and fill it in

3. Add small dots or lines around the outer circle of the eyes

4. Add a dusting of pink blush on the cheek bones

5. Draw on the lines from each corner of the mouth and add vertical ones

6. Add black tip to nose

The complete look was quite striking,and you can make it even more extravagant with a flower garland

STEP THREE: NAILS   

Nail artist Emily from WAH London did my nails at the event. We did 8 nails in one base plain colour, and the nail on the ring finger of each hand in a Day Of The Dead design. To do all 10 you'd need about a day and infinite patience!

We used seven colours on each skull nail (if you're counting the white base!), eight tiny gold balls, a couple of 3D fimo flowers and 2 gems. 

You can get WAH Nail Art Pens from their website or from Boots, at £7 per colour. You can also get all sorts of nail art tools, fimo pieces (like the little clay flowers used for the skull eyes) and gems from eBay.

Steps:

1. File and buff nails, then apply base coat

2. Paint the nail all white

3. Start with the triangle on the forehead, then the nose, then the teeth: Create a straight line near the edge of the nail, then create the scallopedgnashers

4. Use fimo 3D flowers for the eyes and stick gem in centre (you can get these on eBay!)

5. Finally, be creative! Add beads, swirls, dots and hearts with a nail art pen

6. Seal with top coat 

Cheeky tip: If you have a gel kit, leave the flowers off, apply a coat of clear top gel, pop the flowers and gems on, and cure the nail. This should make it hold for much longer.
