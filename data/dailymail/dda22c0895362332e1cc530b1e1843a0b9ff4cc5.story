Tens of billions of pounds were wiped off shares yesterday as Angela Merkel conceded for the first time that Greece could be forced to quit the euro.

The German chancellor suggested that European support for Greece would ‘end’ unless Athens held to the punishing bail-out terms agreed with Brussels and Berlin.

Her warning came amid mounting speculation that Greece could be forced out of the single currency within weeks – plunging both Athens and the single currency into crisis.

Running out of patience: Angela Merkel in Berlin yesteday

Observers have dubbed the possible 
departure as the ‘Grexit’ and one Greek minister last night warned the 
crisis could result in ‘civil war’, with Kalashnikov-toting gangs 
roaming Athens.

Greek newspaper Imerisia reported 
that the government has just £1.2billion left in its coffers – enough to
 continue for only a few days.

Last night there were also rumours of
 an unofficial ‘grey market’ in the drachma – the old Greek currency – 
springing up in anticipation of the exit.

Mrs Merkel, who will hold talks on 
the crisis with new French president Francois Hollande today, said 
Greece would ‘always’ be a member of the EU.

But she left open the question of 
Greece’s membership of the single currency, saying only that it would be
 ‘better’ if it remained within the ailing single currency.

Her comments came as the mounting 
political turmoil in Greece sent shockwaves through world stock markets.
 Mr Hollande will fly to Berlin today for talks just hours after being 
sworn in.

In London, the FTSE-100 index was 
down by 110 points to its lowest level this year, wiping almost 
£30billion off the value of Britain’s top companies. 

Bank shares took a hammering, with Barclays, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland all down by around 5 per cent.

Markets in the U.S. also fell on the news - the Dow Jones was down 125 points, while the Nasdaq fell 31 points.

The euro fell to its lowest level against the pound for three-and-a-half years.

Today, European markets are currently relatively stable, despite yesterday's cataclysmic events.

The
 FTSE-100 is 0.02 per cent up at 5,466.64; Germany's DAX is 1.26 per 
cent up at 6,453.23; while France's CAC 40 is 0.72 per cent up at 
3,079.96.

John
 Cridland, director general of the CBI, warned that a Greek exit from 
the eurozone ‘would be like an earthquake happening’ for the British 
economy.

George Osborne flew to Brussels last night for crisis talks today with EU finance ministers on the future of the euro.

The Chancellor is expected to warn that Europe’s economy is at risk unless Greece is saved.

There were also fresh concerns about 
Spain after financial markets demanded a punishing 6.2 per cent interest
 rate on government loans – the highest level this year.

The crisis unfolded as political 
leaders in Greece gathered in Athens for another round of talks on 
forming a coalition following this month’s elections.

The talks broke up inconclusively and there will be a further round of negotiations today.

But last night there was widespread 
speculation that Greece would be forced to hold fresh elections next 
month after left-wing parties indicated they would boycott any deal that
 supported the austerity drive agreed with the EU.

Polls suggest that the far-left 
Syriza party, which has said it will not impose cuts demanded by the 
eurozone and IMF, could emerge victorious in a fresh poll. Greece’s 
stock market closed at its lowest level since 1992.

Greek politician Michalis 
Chrysohoidis predicted the country would be plunged into ‘civil war’ if 
it quit the euro and readopted the drachma.

The minister for citizen protection 
in the outgoing government said: ‘If Greece cannot meet its obligations 
and serve its debt the pain will be great.

‘What do we have to lose more than we have lost already? Our freedom.

‘What will prevail are armed gangs 
with Kalashnikovs and which one has the greatest number of Kalashnikovs 
will count ... we will end up in civil war.’

But Manolis Glezos, a Syriza MP and a
 veteran of the Second World War resistance, warned Greeks had had 
enough of cuts imposed on them from outside.

He said: ‘Achtung Frau Merkel. The 
Greek people want to live free and they don’t want to be under a new 
occupation from Germany.’
