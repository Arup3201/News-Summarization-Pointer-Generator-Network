Gilbert the dog now has plenty to be happy about after having life-saving surgery to remove a massive tumor.

The Weimeraner was found abandoned in Arizona, barely able to stand or walk because of the size of the growth on his stomach.

After his rescue, his new owners named him Gilbert Grape because his tumor resembled a huge grape.  

All smiles: Gilbert wears shades and a cone after recovering from surgery, which removed his massive tumor

After charity work by the Tickled Pink Weimaraner Rescue centre raised £4,300, Gilbert underwent surgery.

Now, a year after the 12lb benign tumour was removed, Gilbert is all smiles with his adopted owner Scott Roberts. 

The surgery included blood transfusions and an IV catheter to keep him alive.

To help build up the lost muscle mass, Gilbert underwent months of physical therapy before he was adopted.

Finally, Scott took in the plucky grey dog and has given him a home so he can get on with his life. 

Keri Pink, from the rescue centre said it is a 'mystery' that the dog was able to survive for so long.

She said: 'We were called to the isolation wing of a high-kill shelter and found Gilbert there.

'The tumour was so large he could barely stand under its weight.

'How on earth he had survived for so long is still a mystery to us all.

'He was a real trooper though and after the surgery he recovered really quickly.

'To compensate for the growth's mass, he lost a lot of muscle and it took a while for him to get his strength back.' 

The tumor was so large and heavy, Gilbert was barely able to stand. Now, he is able to move about with ease
