The UCI has confirmed an investigation has taken place over the controversial kit worn by a Colombian women's cycling team over the weekend.

IDRD-Bogota Humana-San Mateo-Solgar caused a furore at the Tour of Tuscany after the team wore a kit with a flesh-coloured section from the stomach to the top of the thighs.

UCI president Brian Cookson appeared to make reference to the incident on Twitter on Sunday when he wrote: 'To the many who have raised the issue of a certain women's team kit, we are on the case. It is unacceptable by any standard of decency.'

And the UCI have now confirmed that an investigation has taken place into the incident and the governing body 'will be sending a letter to the Colombian Federation reminding them of their responsibility regarding article 1.3.046.'

Article 1.3.046 reads: 'Each regional or club team for whom one or more riders take part in an event on the international calendar must, at the start of the year, notify the details of their clothing to their national federation specifying in detail the colours and their arrangement and the main sponsors. The name of the region and/or club may appear, in full or in abbreviated form, on the jersey.'

The UCI statement in full read: 'The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) has investigated the issue of the kits worn by women's club team IDRD-Bogota Humana-San Mateo-Solgar of Colombia, this weekend in Italy, in the Tour of Tuscany, a three-day event registered on the UCI calendar as a 2.2 race.

'The UCI will be sending a letter to the Colombian Federation reminding them of their responsibility regarding article 1.3.046 in the control of regional and club team kits that compete in international events.'
