A water manager was caught urinating into a reservoir that provides water for 2.5million people in San Francisco. 

Martin Sanchez, a maintenance planner at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, is likely to be suspended from his $115,000-a-year post after he was caught relieving himself in the Priest Reservoir in the Sierra foothills.

The utilities commission received an anonymous complaint that Sanchez was seen urinating in the reservoir 'several times' by a number of workers.

Martin Sanchez, who works for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, was seen urinating in a reservoir that supplies water to millions of people who live nearby. He is likely to be suspended 

He is now likely to be suspended for five days without pay, CBS reported. 

Tyrone Jue, spokesman for the utilities commission, said the reservoir - which supplies water to people in the Bay Area - was being drained at the time and people faced no risk. He added that water would have been specifically cleaned anyway, had it been in use.

But, he added: 'The bottom line is — you pee in the wrong place again, and you are toast.' 

The actions of Sanchez on January 6 have been branded 'unacceptable.' 

The reservoir holds 674-million gallons of water which supplies around 2.5million people in the nearby area

Water collected from the 674-million gallon reservoir, located around 150 miles from San Francisco, is usually treated with ultraviolet light and chlorine before it is sent by pipeline to supply customers' homes. 

Last April 38 million gallons of water had to be dumped from a reservoir in Oregon after a 19-year-old urinated in it, and was caught on camera.
