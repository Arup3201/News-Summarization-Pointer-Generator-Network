It is a brutal example nature in action - a hungry lioness charges into a pack of crocodiles, swiping with its claws as the huge reptiles snap back in anger.

Despite being completely outnumbered, the ravenous predator still takes on the crocodile gang in an attempt to force them back from the overturned body of a nearby hippo.

These stunning images, taken in a Kenyan nature reserve, show the moment the animals clash in an attempt to win a meal from the carcass.

Clash: The hungry lioness aims a swipe at one of three crocodile stalking the waters

Scrap: The confrontation took place in the Masi Mara nature reserve in Kenya

The lioness, who hunted with another lion, was seen earlier in the day stalking the corpse on the other side of the river.

The hippo had died the night before, but lay unclaimed on the river bank in the Masi Mara reserve for hours.

But by the time the lioness and her companion, who was not pictured, made it to the body, it had been claimed by the pack of crocodiles.

IT manager and part-time photographer Richard Chew captured the encounter while holidaying in Africa with his wife.

Nose to nose: The animals were fighting over the carcass of a hippo which died the previous day

Mr Chew, from San Francisco, said: 'Two lions spotted the hippo at first but couldn't reach it as they were on the wrong side of the river.

'They were really showing no fear. The river was full of crocodiles who were wanting a piece of the hippo but the lions were putting up a good fight.

'It was amazing to watch the wildlife food chain in action.'
