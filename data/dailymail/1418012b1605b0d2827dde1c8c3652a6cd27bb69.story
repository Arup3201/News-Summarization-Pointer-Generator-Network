The FA will hold talks with England team sponsors Vauxhall to revamp the fans’ man of the match award derailed by online voters for both the San Marino and Estonia games.

England supporters made a mockery of Vauxhall’s fans engagement initiative by making goalkeeper Joe Hart MotM on each occasion despite him rarely touching the ball in either Euro 2016 qualifier.

Fans voted for Hart as their man of the match not once but twice and England could change the system

The FA/Vauxhall view is that a one-off cheeky protest about the San Marino mismatch where 63 per cent of the vote went to Hart was fair enough but not when it was repeated in Tallinn when an 82 per cent majority picked the Manchester City player. 

Vauxhall are keen to keep the fans centrally involved in the vote, but need to work on a safety procedure that guards against ridiculous choices being made in future.

TV rights holders ITV choose the official Vauxhall man of the match award at Wembley and co-commentator Andy Townsend went for Jack Wilshere after the stroll against San Marino.

FIFA’s media team are holding a beauty parade of PR companies in London this week involving Webber Shandwick, Burson-Marsteller, Hill & Knowlton and Bell Pottinger. FIFA say they are looking for an agency to do corporate event and branding work for them. But the four firms also have crisis management departments that could be very useful with FIFA facing the fallout from the Garcia report and tricky World Cups in Russia and Qatar. 

Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal’s wealthy chief executive who earned £2.19million in the last financial year, will face embarrassing questions at the club’s annual meeting on Thursday as to why sub-contracted workers at the Emirates Stadium are paid less than the minimum London living wage of £8.80 per hour. 

Arsenal say none of their direct employees have wages of less than that figure. But there are lower paid cleaners and catering staff who work for Arsenal-contracted companies who are responsible for their hourly wage. But the question submitted to the board says Arsenal’s strong financial resources and long tradition for doing things the right way should mean all personnel working at the club should be paid the London living wage.

The mystery continues of just who leaked to Cricinfo that first doctored draft of a document being prepared for the England and Wales Cricket Board by former FA lawyer Richard Bush of Onside Law to potentially counter Kevin Pietersen’s book claims. Cricinfo hired solicitors DLA Piper to state it wasn’t the ECB or Onside Law that gave them it, but will not reveal the source.

Long-term Lancaster?

Neither the RFU nor Stuart Lancaster’s legal advisors involved in negotiating the terms will divulge whether there is a break clause in the astonishing six-year contracts awarded to him and his coaches. But surely — like in other long-term deals for national team bosses — there are ‘liquidating damages’ clauses inserted allowing both sides to extricate themselves.

The Yorkshire and Humberside fraud forum have picked Elland Road of all places as the venue for their annual conference next month. A spokesman said the location was to do with its size and parking facilities and nothing to do with Leeds owner Massimo Cellino’s travails or former managing director David Haigh having spent nearly five months in a Dubai jail.

The FA’s doomed international committee is so dysfunctional the only member of the 12-strong group in Estonia was Wycombe’s Ivor Beeks. The Football League kicked Beeks, who is now only a vice-president at Wycombe, off the committee in the summer because they wanted to be represented by board members. Yet he has somehow returned as a Premier League representative.

Birmingham City’s Andy Walker was the FA choice from candidates from the Premier League and the Football League to become the senior communications manager liaising between the England team and the media. His social skills were viewed as important after his highly combative predecessor Stuart Mawhinney, now at Sky Sports, fell out with the England press corps in Brazil.
