It is a problem parents face every year - how to get the kids to bed early on New Year's Eve.

Many have tried changing clocks, throwing fake parties and even tuning in to TV stations on the other side of the world.

However, Netflix now has a hi-tech solution- an on demand New Year's Eve show for kids that can be played at any time.

Netflix boasts over 53 million members in nearly 50 countries

Offers more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies

Planning 20 original series in 2015

More than a third of U.S. parents (34%) admitted to starting the party early to fool their kids into thinking it’s midnight, citing their kid’s or their own bedtime as the reason, a recent survey from Wakefield Research on behalf of Netflix.

22% would go as far as to stage a countdown of their own, the team found.

To make the problem easier, Netflix commissioned a special show starring King Julien, star of DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien. 

The animated lemur will host his very own kid-sized countdown “special” on Netflix that families can use to ring in 2015 whenever they choose to celebrate.

The three minutes of high-energy, music-filled fun that lets kids celebrate the New Year no matter the time of day. 

The countdown will be available in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, UK, Ireland, the Nordics, the Netherlands and France beginning on Dec. 29th at Netflix.com/KingJulien. 

Netflix boasts over 53 million members in nearly 50 countries, and offers more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies per month, including original series.

Earlier this month, the company announced it hopes to have up to 20 original series running alongside its other shows and movies.

The announcement was made by chief content officer Theodore Sarandos in a conference in New York.

He was reported as saying, by Seeking Alpha, that Netflix wants to expand its original programming to ‘as many as 20 original series’.

This is apparently a move to try and replicate the success of channels such as HBO.

Mr Sarandos said the idea was to launch an ‘original season of content every two and a half weeks’ to get into a ‘regular drumbeat with consumer expectation.’

Netflix is also planning to release more original movies, which include a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon next year - subtitled ‘The Green Destiny’.

The move follows news earlier in the year that Yahoo is also making its own original TV shows.

The first of these will be comedies titled Other Space and Sin City Saints, and they will be shown on the Yahoo website, mobile app, Apple TV and Roku devices.

The series, which launch in 2016, will be available free to be viewers.

And beginning in the summer of 2015, Yahoo is also planning to stream one live concert every day through a partnership with Live Nation.

The expansion makes Yahoo one of the latest technology companies to mount a challenge to Netflix.

Microsoft, Amazon, Hulu and Wuaki are among the other companies angling for a piece of the growing audience watching video piped over high-speed internet connections.
