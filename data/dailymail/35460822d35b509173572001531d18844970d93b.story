At the start of the season there were question marks over Jack Wilshere and when Roy Hodgson asked him to play slightly deeper in the England midfield people wondered whether he would be up to the mark.

From what we've seen so far, he's making us re-evaluate him as player. Let's be clear that it's very early days and his real tests in what is a very demanding position are yet to come. But from what we've seen so far, he has every right to be encouraged by the way he has adapted to the role.

Wilshere is showing skills and facets of his game which we haven't seen before. It's actually making him a better player. I've always thought that he needed to play the ball earlier and quicker than he sometimes has done with Arsenal; playing in this role, he is forced to do exactly that.

Arsene Wenger has him down as a box-to-box midfielder and we typically think of him bursting down the pitch. But he's looking for the early pass now. He has to look forward quicker, is releasing the ball earlier and is hitting passes over the back of people.

He's now looking for Wayne Rooney and they are developing a bit of a relationship. Rooney now knows if he makes good movement, Jack will pick him out.

I thought Wilshere was England's best player on Saturday, though the real test of whether he is up to playing in that position will be when we are up against better teams and he is playing against a top quality No 10. At the moment, in this Euro 2016 qualifying group, England will enjoy a lot of possession, which means Wilshere gets to see a lot of the ball.

It's an ideal scenario to learn the role. We need to wait to see how he does when we're defending for long periods against top quality teams. Against Portugal, Germany, Spain or Italy we're not going to dominate possession. Then his defensive skills and movement will be tested and that will be a challenge. But for now, I've been very impressed.

Obviously, as a whole, England's performance started slowly and ended well. There was a real lack of movement in the first half and no spark at all. It was all very methodical. England had plenty of ball possession but didn't create nearly enough.

Clearly something would have been said at half-time to change that. Maybe not stern words, but Roy Hodgson and his team got the message across, even if Slovenia scored first through Jordan Henderson's own goal. There was more intensity to England's game throughout the second half.

Rooney was good, if not brilliant, on the occasion of his 100th cap. You couldn't really have asked much more from a captain than the manner in which he took the game to Slovenia in the immediate aftermath of England conceding.

His character was evident as he collected the ball and got into them and then his skill and movement was excellent to win the penalty. Scoring it capped a great day for him.

Nathaniel Clyne did OK but needs to get closer to club form and though Raheem Sterling is not back to his form of last season, he was part of the reason why we got stronger in the game. He was bogged down in the first half but the move to put him out wide right in the second and to stretch the game a little gave us a lot more width and helped simplify his game.

Overall, it's difficult to assess the future using these games as a barometer of England's form.

Tournament football will be very different to the qualification phase and England won't be allowed nearly as much possession.

They will have to use the friendlies much more as a test of how they're improving and perhaps the Scotland game — if we can call any game against Scotland a friendly — is useful in that regard.

Maybe Hodgson will rest a few players, maybe Ross Barkley will get a run but, overall, the game comes at a good time.

Scotland won't want to sit back at home against England as most of their opponents do. The game will have passion, intensity and the defence will be stretched a lot more.

On Saturday evening ended up positively with England on the front foot. But Tuesday night will be a step into the unknown for some of these young players.

Hodgson will learn a little bit more about his team at Celtic Park and perhaps that will begin to give us a real idea as to whether they have moved on from the World Cup.
