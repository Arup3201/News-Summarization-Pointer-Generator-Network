A German man has confessed to strangling his wife and sealing her in a concrete tomb in the family home... because he 'could not bear her nagging any longer'.

Gerd Paulus, 52, told a court in Bonn that he murdered wife Sigrid, 40, as they showered together - in cold water because she said they had to save money - as she moaned at him to get a job.

Speaking soberly and calmly, he told the courtroom: 'I could bear the continuous nagging no longer. No man could. She was violently yelling at me to find a new job. She could win a gold medal for nagging.'

Crime scene: Gerd Paulus, 52, said he murdered wife Sigrid, 40, as they showered together as she moaned at him to get a job before burying her behind a wine rack at their home in Königswinter, western Germany

'At that moment I remember I only wanted peace. I hit her on the head and she began bleeding.  I put my hands around her throat.  I had a kind of a blackout.  When I came to I had a noise in my head. I had strangled her. She had no pulse.'

That was six years ago. He then told the court how he reported her missing to police and burst into tears when reporters visited him at his home in the ritzy Bonn suburb of Konigswinter saying he 'missed' his wife and didn't know where she had gone.

Last September he remarried. The new wife moved into his home, unaware that bride number one, and mother to his two children, was sealed in concrete behind a wine rack in the cellar.

He went on: 'Before my children came home on the day of her death I cleaned away the blood in the bathroom and hid her corpse in the cellar.  I gave the kids money to go to McDonalds.' He then used building materials in the garden to build the concrete tomb.

In December 2012 the daughter of Sigrid contacted a journalist to help her find her missing mother.  The journalist discovered that in all the time she was missing she drew no money from her bank account and never once used her insurance card for medical treatment.

He went to the German show - Aktenzeichen XY - a Crimewatch-style programme - which aired a segment on her.  It sparked a new police probe which saw officers rip up the garden and the cellar....leading to the discovery of the mummified Sigrid.

Salesman Paulus will be sentenced on March 17 and is expected to get life imprisonment.
