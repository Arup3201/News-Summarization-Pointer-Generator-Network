Classic: Maya Angelou's autobiography is being taken off the syllabus by Welsh board WJEC

Maya Angelou’s autobiography has been culled by an exam board as a row over English Literature GCSEs deepened yesterday.

WJEC revealed plans to drop foreign prose from its new qualification, along with AQA, the biggest exam provider in Britain, and OCR.

Pupils will no longer study Angelou’s I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings with WJEC, the Welsh-based examiner, from next year. 

The acclaimed African-American author, poet and civil rights activist died on Wednesday aged 86.

WJEC’s proposed new syllabus removes a section on ‘different cultures prose’ which covered the 1969 autobiography as well as John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men; Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird and Chanda’s Secrets by Canadian Allan Stratton.

However, the American writer is included among a long list of poets pupils should cover to prepare for an ‘unseen poetry’ exam.

The news came as AQA confirmed it was ditching an ‘exploring cultures’ section from its new English Literature GCSE.

This means the loss of texts including Of Mice And Men; To Kill A Mockingbird; Doris Pilkington’s Rabbit-Proof Fence; Lloyd Jones’ Mister Pip and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus. 

OCR, a third exam board, has axed its ‘prose from different cultures’ section.

This also covered Of Mice and Men and To Kill A Mockingbird as well as Amy Tan’ s The Joy Luck Club; Roddy Doyle’s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha and Athol Fugard’s Tsotsi.

The new specifications threaten to undermine Education Secretary Michael Gove’s claims that the government has not put pressure on examiners to ban non-British novels.

More than 55,000 people have signed a petition against his English Literature GCSE reforms.

The Department for Education has insisted that its document about content for the subject, published last year, ‘doesn’t ban any authors, books or genres’. 

New GCSEs must include at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one nineteenth century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and ‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’.

Mr Gove has argued that all exam boards have the freedom to ‘include any number of other texts from which teachers can then choose’.

But an AQA spokeswoman said yesterday: ‘Whilst technically it would not be impossible to add additional texts beyond the essential requirements, to do so would place an unacceptable assessment burden on teachers and students, which we are clearly not prepared to do.’

And Paul Dodd, OCR’s head of GCSE and A-level reform, has personally blamed Mr Gove for the ‘restrictions’, saying that the Education Secretary ‘really dislikes’ Of Mice And Men.

OCR proposed new content features Meera Syal’s Anita and Me; Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go; George Orwell’s Animal Farm, Dennis Kelly’s DNA and J.B.Priestley’s An Inspector Calls.

AQA lists these texts as well as Stephen Kelman’s Pigeon English; William Golding’s Lord of the Flies and AQA Anthology, Telling Tales, under modern prose.

'Everyone will have an opinion about which texts should be studied. We can't please everyone'

- AQA spokesman

In modern drama, pupils will be able to study Alan Bennett’s The History Boys; Willy Russell’s Blood Brothers; Shelagh Delaney’s A Taste of Honey and Simon Stephens’ The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (script).

Under the ‘19th century novel’ teenagers will study texts including Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Sign of Four.

The AQA poetry selection has a strong emphasis on British and Irish writers. It includes Byron, Shelley, Tennyson, Seamus Heaney, Thomas Hardy and Ted Hughes.

AQA’s chief executive, Andrew Hall, said yesterday: ‘We know that everyone will have an opinion about which texts should be studied and that we can’t please everyone.'

On Wednesday, Nobel Prize-winning American writer, Toni Morrison, told the Hay Festival that it was wrong to divide literature into ‘nationalistic categories’. She said Mr Gove would regret the decision.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘In the past, English Literature GCSEs were not rigorous enough and their content was often far too narrow.’

Michael Gove has come under fire for the changes but insists exam boards have the freedom to choose texts

The proposals from AQA, OCR and WJEC have been submitted to Ofqual for accreditation, for first teaching from next year. Edexcel will publish its specifications today.

A DfE spokesman: ‘The new GCSEs in English Literature will be broader and more challenging for pupils than those available at the moment. They will give pupils the chance to study some this country’s fantastic literary heritage, including works by Jane Austen, George Orwell, Kazuo Ishiguro and Meera Syal. 

‘We have not banned any authors, books or genres. The exam boards have decided what literature to include, subject to the minimum requirements we set out. GCSE specifications are only a starting point.’

He added: ‘Our new secondary curriculum also explicitly sets out that children must learn about ‘seminal world literature’ between 11 and 14. American classics are precisely the sorts of books we would expect to be taught at this age.’
