Dramatic CCTV footage has emerged from China of a truck losing control and smashing into crash barriers on both sides of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge in Zhejiang Province on Christmas Eve.

The truck can be seen repeatedly veering left and right before stopping in the middle of the road, blocking the whole lane for almost an hour.

When the video is sped up slightly, the effect of the crash seems almost like a scene from a pinball machine.

The wreckage of the truck after it smashed into both sides of the Chinese bridge

Around a hundred metres of guard rails were damaged but miraculously the truck didn't smash through the side and into the Hangzhou Bay.

According to local reports the accident was caused by a burst front tyre.

The saving grace was that the truck was some way ahead of the following traffic - and with two coaches being behind, the collision could have easily become fatal. 

A flat tyre saw the truck firstly crash into the right-hand side of the bridge, but thankfully didn't exit that way

After coming to a standstill, the driver managed to escape from the truck with minor injuries

Although the cab was smashed the lucky driver only suffered minor injury to his chin, and he was even able to give an interview after.

The Hangzhou Bay Bridge was constructed in 2003 and connects the municipalities of Jiaxing and Ningbo in Zhejiang province.

The Bridge spans 22 miles and carries six lanes of traffic.
