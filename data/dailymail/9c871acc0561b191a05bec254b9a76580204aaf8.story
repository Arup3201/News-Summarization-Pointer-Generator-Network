A motorcyclist journalist claimed he drove at speeds of 160mph during a test drive because his girlfriend had agreed to marry him.

Andrew Stevens, 30, was banned from driving for three months after being filmed by police doing wheelies on his 1,000cc Yamaha and hitting speeds twice the legal limit. 

Today, police released some of the two-and-a-half minute video to highlight the dangers of speeding.

Dangerous: Andrew Stevens reaches speeds of 160mph on his powerful 1,000cc Yamaha bike as he is tailed by an unmarked police officer

Yet road safety campaigners have criticised Stevens' ban as too lenient and say it does not act as a deterrent.

Motorcycle
journalist Stevens, who writes for website Visordown, admitted he 
had made a 'stupid mistake'.

But he claimed to be speeding because he was 
'euphoric' at the time as he had just proposed to his girlfriend 
and she had accepted.

He 
was followed by a police officer on an unmarked bike along Seven Mile 
Lane, near Tonbridge, in Kent, where he twice reached speeds above 
100mph before peaking at 160mph when he drove onto a dual carriageway.

Stevens also performed a wheelie as he overtook a lorry at about 50mph and again as he accelerated towards 100mph.

Sorry: Motorcycle journalist Stevens held back tears as he told court he made a 'stupid mistake' and vowed never to appear before them again

He fought back tears as he told Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court: 'I made a stupid mistake.

'This was going to be the last year I ever had a bike like that. It’s a shame it’s ended this way. You will never see me again.'

Prosecutor James Nichols said: 'The 
defendant took off at 128mph in the 50mph (zone). The road was clear, he
slowed down to just below 100mph when he came to the brow of the hill.

'He got slowed up in traffic. He shot off towards the Hop Farm towards Paddock Wood and got up to a speed of 160mph.'

The
court heard that when Stevens was pulled over by PC Townsend, from
Kent Police Tactical Operations Group, on June 27, he told the officer:
'I am such an idiot. I am a journalist.

'I was doing a test drive. I can't believe I did that.'

However,
during the hearing on October 26 David Barton, defending, tried to 
blame the officer for not pulling Stevens over sooner.

He said: 'He stayed behind him for about two-and-a-half minutes during which time the very high speed was reached.

'One will never know why the officer simply did not stop him for speeding. He could have done.'

He added Stevens was so happy because his girlfriend had agreed to marry him and set their wedding for 2014.

Mr Barton said: 'It is a very powerful machine which he was perfectly capable of driving safely. There is always the potential for something to go wrong.

'He did not know he was being followed by an unmarked police bike.'

Stevens, from Tonbridge, pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.

As well as the ban, he was fined £500, ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

The sentence was met with anger from road safety groups.

Caroline Derrick, chair of safety
campaign group Tunbridge Wells Is Traffic Aware, said: 'Where is the 
deterrent? That is not severe enough, it is like a slap on the wrists, 
‘naughty boy and don’t do it again’.

'It is totally and utterly irresponsible to do those speeds.'

Clare Morrison of national road safety charity Brake added: 'All those found guilty of this offence should experience the full weight of the law.'

Kent Police said the department PC Townsend works for obtain 'virtually a 100 per cent conviction rate' such is the quality of evidence.

Acting Head of Roads Policing, Chief Inspector Paul Sellwood added: 'I would like to reassure all those that use the roads responsibly that our unmarked bikes and

cars are there for their safety, and they have nothing to fear from them.

'If caught committing an offence you risk a fine, driving ban and potentially losing your job or a sentence of imprisonment.

'More than this, think abut the consequences to yourself and your family of being involved in a serious collision. You could kill or maim yourself or someone else.

'All too often we see the devastating effects of careless and dangerous driving or riding on those involved and their families.

'This is why, with our road safety partners, we are determined to make our roads as safe as possible.'
