Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave England hope he could make the World Cup after training in a knee brace on Monday.

The Arsenal winger inflamed ligaments in his right knee during England's 2-2 draw with Ecuador in Miami last week.

Oxlade-Chamberlain emerged halfway through England's training session at the Urca military base and was put through some running exercises by head physio Gary Lewin.

The England midfielder was told he would be out for at least 10 days when he sustained the injury.

England head coach Roy Hodgson has until 24 hours before the opening group game against Italy on Saturday to decide whether to replace Oxlade-Chamberlain if he is deemed unfit for the whole tournament.

Captain Steven Gerrard also trained away from the main two groups on Monday and finished his session early after tightness in his groin.

England were guarded by Brazilian Army personnel as they trained in the shadown of Sugar Loaf mountain.
