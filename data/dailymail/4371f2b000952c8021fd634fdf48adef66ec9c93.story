An inspector from the care watchdog has been arrested on suspicion of faking glowing nursing home reports in exchange for cash.

The 43-year-old woman is being questioned by police over allegations of bribery and money laundering.

She has already been sacked by the Care Quality Commission, which launched its own investigation after being alerted by a whistleblower at a nursing home.

It is understood the inspector, from Northamptonshire, visited a number of privately run care homes and offered to fill out ‘favourable’ inspection reports in exchange for bribes.

Her arrest yesterday morning is yet another blow for the CQC, which has been dogged by accusations it is failing to protect vulnerable patients. 

Only this week it emerged carers at a home rated as ‘excellent’ had repeatedly slapped and manhandled an elderly woman with dementia.

A CQC spokesman said that after it was alerted, the woman was sacked for gross misconduct and the CQC informed City of London Police.

Louise Guss, the CQC’s director of governance and legal services, said: ‘Our inspectors operate to extremely high standards of integrity and professionalism.

‘Unfortunately, in any large workforce there is a risk that a tiny minority may act in a way that betrays the principles of their colleagues and of the organisation as a whole, which is what has happened here. 

A Care Quality Commission spokesman said that after it was alerted, the 43-year-old woman was sacked for gross misconduct and the CQC informed City of London Police

‘Having investigated allegations made to us about this inspector and found these were substantiated, we terminated their employment with immediate effect and referred the matter to the police.

‘This inspector has failed the organisation, failed the providers who rely on us to act fairly  and impartially, and – most importantly – failed in their responsibility to protect people who use these services.

‘CQC operates a zero tolerance policy in regard to fraudulent or dishonest behaviour.’

Detective Inspector James Clancey said: ‘We are working closely with CQC to thoroughly investigate these allegations.

‘We are appealing to anyone who may have information to come forward.’

Earlier this year, the CQC’s chief executive, Cynthia Bower, resigned amid concerns the organisation was failing to adequately inspect care homes and hospitals.

In March, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee accused the organisation of putting its reputation ahead of the safety of patients.

Other reports by MPs have criticised the watchdog for prioritising box-ticking over carrying out spot checks of care homes.

But the CQC claims it has made substantial improvements in recent months and drastically increased the number of inspections.

Yesterday it announced it would be investigating the standards  of care for 250 elderly folk in their own homes.
