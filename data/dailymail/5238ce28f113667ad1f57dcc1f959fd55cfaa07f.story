An arrest warrant has been issued for a real estate heir who admitted killing his neighbor in Texas a decade ago, because he failed to show up for a New York City court appearance.

Robert Durst's lawyer Steven Rabinowitz says his 73-year-old client is in Texas and unable to travel for undisclosed medical reasons.

Durst is facing a trespassing charge following a 2013 arrest at his brother's midtown Manhattan home. He had been told to stay away.

Rabinowitz said he expects the warrant to be dismissed when Durst can return.

Back to court: Robert Durst is pictured leaving a Houston courtroom in August where he faced charges of criminal mischief for urinating on candy at a CVS. It is just his latest brush with the law and now a warrant is out for his arrest

Robert Durst, who was acquitted of the murder in 2003 after claiming self defense, was arrested in July for allegedly urinating over 
$100 worth of candy - Skittles - at the register in a Houston store.

The 71-year-old was supposed to appear in court today after being freed on a $5,000 bond, however he did not show up, and now a warrant has been issued for his arrest.

The bizarre incident unfolded when he walked in to the store to collect a prescription in July.

Accused: Durst allegedly urinated on $100 worth of candy in July after getting in to an argument with staff

'He picked 
up his prescription, and he then exposes himself and pees all over the 
cash register and candy at the register and then walks out and walks 
down the street,' Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva said at the time.

'He wasn't arguing with anybody and he didn't seem agitated. He just peed on the candy. Skittles, I think.'

But
 Durst has been making headlines for years - first over his wife's 
mysterious disappearance and then over the murder of his elderly 
neighbor in 2001. in which he admitted killing his 
neighbor and dumping the remains into Galveston Bay.

He claimed 
self-defense and was acquitted of homicide.

His father, Seymour, was a New York real estate mogul who amassed billions 
of dollars worth of commercial property in Manhattan. Robert, a 
well-connected socialite, worked for his father's Durst 
Organization for years as a developer.

But he was estranged from his 
family around 1994 after being passed over as heir to the company 
leadership in favour of his brother Douglas.

The 
Houston Chronicle reported that in 2006 he finally won a $65 million 
court settlement from his family, restoring a piece of his family 
fortune.

Questions: Durst, with his wife Kathleen Durst, was suspected to be responsible for her 1982 disappearance

Ten years earlier, Durst had gained infamy in New York 
due to the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Kathie, and many believed the real estate scion had something to do with it.

He was questioned in her murder - and in the murder of her friend when the case was re-opened in 2000 - but was never charged.

He has now re-married, KTRK reported, but the identity of his new wife was not released.

Then in September 2001, remnants of the body of Morris 
Black, Durst's next-door neighbor in the boarding house where he was 
living, were found floating in the Galveston Bay in 
Galveston, Texas.

A trail of blood led police back to an apartment being rented by a mute woman,
Dorothy Ciner - who was actually Durst in a dress.

It emerged that Durst had gone into hiding for years, partially to escape the increasing inquiries about the death of his wife.

Killer: Durst is pictured left in a police 
booking photo in 2001 after he was arrested for the murder of neighbor 
Morris Black, right. At the time of the killing, he had been 
cross-dressing to conceal his real identity

Acquitted: He admitted to shooting and dismembering Black but claimed he had acted in self-defense after they argued over a gun. He was acquitted and served a year for tampering with evidence

After
 spending a month on the run, Durst tried to steal a chicken 
salad sandwich and a single a Band-Aid from a supermarket in 
Philadelphia while wearing a blond mustache and was arrested.

Durst
 admitted to shooting Black and dismembering him before dumping the body parts in the Bay.

But he insisted that he had acted in self defense as they struggled over a handgun and he was acquitted.

But
 he was found guilty for tampering with evidence over the disposal of 
the body and was sentenced to five years in prison, but served just one.

Despite his run-ins with the law, he still has access to his $43 million trust fund, which he has used to buy and develop real estate in New York.

The Durst Organization is a billion-dollar real estate company that owns several skyscrapers.

In July, it was reported that Durst sold two Brooklyn buildings for 
$21.15 million, after buying them for $8.65 million in 2011.
