A San Francisco cyclist who allegedly killed a 71-year-old
man but defended his actions on a cycling forum will face felony gross vehicular manslaughter charges, it was ruled on Thursday.

Chris Bucherre, 36, is said to have plowed into Sutchi Hui at
a busy San Francisco intersection shortly before 8:10am on March 29, 2012.

Superior Court Judge Andrew Y.S. Cheng announced that Bucchere should face the felony charge. If found guilty, Bucchere could face a maximum of six years in prison.

Alex Bastian, prosecuting Assistant District Attorney, said 'Court testimony indicated that 
[Bucchere] was going at least 30 mph and that he ran two red lights and a
stop sign prior to going through the intersection where the collision 
occurred.'

As reported by the LA Times, District Attorney George Gascon stated: 'Today the judge reaffirmed our decision to charge this case as a felony.

'I hope this case serves as a reminder to all that there are life-altering consequences to not following the rules of the road,' Gascon added.

A felony charge is rare for a bicycle collision. The Wall Street Journal noted that the district attorney's office wasn't able to find another case of vehicular manslaughter involving a bicycle in recent years in the U.S.

Bucchere's attorney, Ted Cassman, had argued during an earlier hearing that the charge should be reduced to misdemeanor.

Tragic: Chris Bucchere allegedly struck 71-year-old Sutchi Hui, who later died, at a busy San Francisco intersection, and then identified himself as the rider in the crash on an internet forum

Witnesses told 
police that Bucchere might have run a red light before striking the 
elderly man, who tragically died in hospital four days after the 
collision.

The cyclist,
who was also hospitalized for injuries he sustained in the crash, 
apparently posted on the 'Mission Cycling AM Riders' Google group to 
tell his side of the story on the same day.

The 
post, which has since been removed, said: 'The light turned yellow as I 
was approaching the intersection, but I was already way too committed to
stop.

'The
light turned red as I was cruising through the middle of the 
intersection and then, almost instantly, the southern crosswalk on 
Market and Castro filled up with people coming from both directions... 
so, in a nutshell, blammo.'

The
poster, 'Bucchere Chris', who identified himself as the man responsible
for the crash, then continued to recount the final few moments before 
the fatal collision. 

'I
couldn't see a line through the crowd and I couldn't stop, so I laid it
down and just plowed through the crowded crosswalk in the 
least-populated place I could find,' he said.

'I 
don't remember the next five minutes but when I came to, I was in a neck
brace being loaded into an ambulance. I remember seeing a RIVER of 
blood on the asphalt, but it wasn't mine.

'Apparently I hit a 71-year-old
male pedestrian and he ended up in the ICU with pretty serious head 
injuries. I really hope he ends up OK.'

Widowed: Hui's wife Betty, who was a witness to the accident, says she is at a loss without her husband, adding that he was her best friend

But what created the most outrage among internet users was the way the Bucherre ended his post, after detailing the seriousness of the injuries sustained by the man he had hit.

'In closing, I want to dedicate this story to my late helmet. She died in heroic fashion today as my head slammed into the tarmac... may she die knowing that because she committed the ultimate sacrifice, her rider and live and ride on. Can I get an amen? Amen.'

One user, who posted under the name hssrinsf, wrote on website SFist: 'Moron, the guy was 71 years old. Whether it was red, green or yellow, he was going way too fast if he wasn't able to stop in time.'

Another, who posted under the name Richard, said: 'It takes just one f***in jerk like Chris to give a bad name to the countless other bikers whom obey laws and ride safely.'

And one person, who posted under the name MattySF, said: 'Your 
irresponsibility injured (and ultimately killed) a man and you took to 
the internet to tell your story?  Yeah, you deserve jail time jackass.'

Location: The intersection at Castro and Market streets, in San Francisco, where the fatal accident took place

D.A. Spokesman Omid Talai told the San Francisco Chronicle they considered the posts to be the work of Bucchere. 'We've seen it,' said Talai. 'It's troubling.'

Last year Bucherre's attorney, Ted Cassman, released a statement to the San Francisco Chronicle saying his client believes he entered the intersection lawfully.

'Chris is devastated by the accident last Thursday and by the tragic death of Sutchi Hui,' Cassman said.

'Chris believes that he entered the intersection lawfully and that he did everything possible to avoid the accident. His heart goes out to Mr Hui's wife and family for their loss.'

But Hui's wife, Betty, who was with him at the time of the crash, told how she saw her injured husband covered in blood and how she is at a loss without him. 'I heard something ... and I turned around and my husband was [lying] down on the floor,' she told CBS San Francisco.

'He was a wonderful guy, he was not only a husband for me, he was my best friend.'
