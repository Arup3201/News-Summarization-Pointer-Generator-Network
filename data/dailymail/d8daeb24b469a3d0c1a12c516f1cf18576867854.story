Firefighters had to be called to a hospital in China to help doctors free a young girl's tongue that has become stuck in a cup lid.

Doctors had failed to cut the lid open and called in an entire team of firefighters to help cut open the lid.

The six-year-old girl had arrived at the hospital with her parents after getting her tongue stuck in a sippy cup.

Pain: The six-year-old girl arrives at a hospital in Qingdao, northern China's Shandong Province

Help: When doctors tried and failed to cut through the cup lid, firefighters were called in to help free the girl

Operation: When the team of firefighters arrived they spent 20 minutes cutting the lid off the girl's tongue

The unnamed girl had been stuck in the lid for over an hour when she arrived with her family at a hospital in Qingdao, northern China's Shandong Province.

As her circulation was cut off, the tongue swelled up and doctors began cutting into the lid to free her.

However, the medical tools at hand did not work on the slippery lid and the fire services were called.

It took firefighters around 20 minutes to carefully cut through the plastic and free the girl's tongue. 

Freed: The girl is receiving treatment after being stuck in the lid for more than an hour

Recovering: The little girl rests in the arms of a family member after being cut loose 

Big mistake: The lid of the drinking cup after firefighters cut the girl's tongue free
