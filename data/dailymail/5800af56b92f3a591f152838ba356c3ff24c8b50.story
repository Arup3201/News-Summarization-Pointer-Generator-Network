The coalition is overseeing the biggest reduction in Britain’s vast public sector workforce for half a century, and will have slashed one in five jobs by the time austerity is due to come to an end, a report says today.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says employment by the state will fall by 1.1 million, or 19 per cent, by 2018-19 compared with when George Osborne entered the Treasury in 2010.

But in a significant endorsement of the Government’s plan to rebalance the economy in favour of the private sector, it concludes that a ‘buoyant’ jobs market means that thus far firms in in every region have created more positions than public employment has fallen.

The share of the workforce employment by the state is already at its lowest level for at least 40 years, with 5.4 million employees or just under 20 per cent, the IFS says. Further planned cuts will mean the figure falling to just 14.8 per cent, a ‘dramatic change’ in the nature of the UK labour market.

When Labour lost the 2010 general election, the public sector employed about 6.1 million workers, with their pay bill accounting for well over half of day-to-day Government spending.

Critics accuse Gordon Brown of seeking to create a ‘client’ state, with more and more people dependent on the Government for employment or benefits.

Today’s report says if the forecast of a 1.1 million fall in public sector employment by 2018-19 is delivered, it  would dwarf the fall of 350,000 seen in the 1990s and more than undo the increase of over 600,000 seen under Labour during the 2000s.

However, it warns of significant challenges to the Government’s plans – saying savage cutbacks in other areas will be required if it maintains existing protections for the NHS and schools.

Already 57 per cent of public sector workers are employed in these two sectors, up from 42 per cent in 1991.

This proportion could reach over 70 per cent by 2018 if education and health continue to protected from future workforce cuts.

The report says delivering the planned cuts without reducing the numbers working in health and education will be ‘very challenging’.

If there continue to be reductions to the education and NHS workforces between now and 2018, the rest of the government workforce will have to shrink by  40 per cent, from 2.2 to 1.3 million.

Even if the education and the NHS workforces were reduced by 200,000 over the next five years - a fall of six per cent -  the reductions in other areas of general government employment would still need to be about 30 per cent.

The report also says that women now make up two-thirds of the public sector workforce, a proportion which will continue to grow -  mainly since women are more likely than men to work in areas where the budget is being protected from cuts, such as health and education.

It also reveals a dramatic variation in the dependence of different regions and countries of the UK on the public sector for jobs.

If there continue to be reductions to the education and NHS workforces between now and 2018, the rest of the government workforce will have to shrink by  40 per cent, from 2.2 to 1.3 million.

In inner London, 23 per cent of people are employed by the state, compared to 34 per cent in Merseyside and 36 per cent in Tyne and Wear.

The public sector workforce is also still dominant in areas of rural Wales and Scotland, and the smallest in areas of rural England and the M4 corridor.

Jonathan Cribb, research economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: ‘The public sector workforce grew by over 600,000 over the 2000s.

'Even so the scale of the reductions expected over the next few years looks challenging. If delivered, the 1.1 million drop in general government employment… between 2010–11 and 2018–19 would be almost three times larger than the previous drop during the early 1990s.

‘The workforce is a useful prism through which to look at the effects of cutting total spending whilst protecting the NHS and schools budgets from cuts.

'With limited falls in the health and education workforces the number of public sector workers in other areas could fall by 30-40% over the next five years.’
