Pascal Soriot, the boss of AstraZeneca, said yesterday that he was willing to consider further bids from Pfizer despite warning MPs that the 'distracting' takeover bid could cost lives

The boss of AstraZeneca last night admitted he would consider selling out to Pfizer if the price increases – just hours after telling MPs the controversial bid could cost lives by delaying the development of anti-cancer drugs.

Pascal Soriot, who has branded the  US bid a ‘distraction’ and said it would put lives at risk, also claimed the disruption from the potential deal was ‘manageable’.

In an apparent change of tone, he made clear that the AstraZeneca board was willing to consider further bids from its bigger rival.

Mr Soriot said: ‘We will consider offers that are made to us in the context of the value, the price that’s offered and the potential of the terms. But certainly the price is a very important dimension.’

He added: ‘We cannot rule out doing a deal because ultimately we have to make sure we represent the interests of our shareholders, and if the price that is offered reflects the full value of the company, of course we would have to make a positive recommendation.’

Yesterday, Mr Soriot had warned MPs that Pfizer’s bid will cost lives by delaying the development of anti-cancer drugs.

He told the Commons business select committee that the £63billion deal would be a massive ‘distraction’ that would delay work on life-saving drugs.

‘What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed because our companies were involved in saving taxes or saving costs?’ he asked MPs.

The firm’s research chief Mene Pangalos warned the deal would have a potentially ‘devastating’ impact, with wide-ranging implications for jobs, science and the development of life-saving drugs.

Mr Pangalos told the committee that the history of mega-mergers in the drugs industry was that they are ‘very challenging to get through’.

Yesterday Ian Reed, the head of Pfizer, was also questioned by MPs but refused to give guarantees on jobs

If the £63billion takeover of Astrazeneca by Pfizer goes, it will be the largest in British corporate history

He added: ‘There are a lot of job losses, there are changes in projects, changes in strategy, changes  in direction. It takes a long time to get through – it can be devastating.’

In a day of major developments:

Yesterday saw tetchy exchanges with MPs on the select committee, which is led by former librarian Adrian Bailey, but there was no  real interrogation of Pfizer’s plans for AstraZeneca, and Mr Read was able to bat away concerns about  its future.

There are concerns that Pfizer could be using the takeover of AstraZeneca to strip the company of its assets and cut swathes of staff, concerns Mr Read sought to dismiss

Among the assurances Mr Read gave to MPs was that 20 per cent of the company's combined R&D staff would stay in the UK for at least five years after the deal

Mr Read also dismissed their worries about Pfizer’s reputation as an ‘asset-stripper’, saying it was ‘a company of high integrity’.

He also confirmed that jobs would be lost but added: ‘I cannot say how many or where.’

Mr Read insisted that pledges made to ministers – including keeping 20 per cent of the combined firm’s R&D staff in the UK – were ‘legally binding’ and would last for at least five years following the completion of a deal. But MPs raised doubts about weak commitments.

Tory MP Brian Binley dismissed Mr Read’s presentation as ‘a lot of sales talk, but short on facts’.

Labour’s Willie Bain told Mr Read: ‘There are no commitments of any substance being made.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday held a 30-minute meeting with Mr Read, but when he emerged from the talks he called for ministers to intervene.

He said: ‘There are serious concerns about this takeover. There are too many unanswered questions.’

Treasury sources said Chancellor George Osborne had held a 45-minute meeting with Astra boss  Mr Soriot yesterday afternoon.

However, the Institute of Directors cautioned ministers against ‘mounting a British inquisition’ into the deal.

Director general Simon Walker warned of the ‘growing politicisation’ of the deal.
