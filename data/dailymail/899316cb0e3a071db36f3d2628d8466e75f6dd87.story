A council is to be forced to repay thousands of parking fines it handed out over six years after a legal blunder saw around 7,000 tickets declared null and void.

Serious errors were uncovered in Calderdale Council's legal paperwork, meaning it hasn't had the right to enforce fines for on-street parking breaches in Halifax town centre since 2008.

The blunder was uncovered after a parking ticket was successfully challenged by a member of the public, and is expected to cost the council around half a million pounds as thousands motorists claim refunds.

Around 7,000 motorists are thought to be eligible for refunds after a local council in Yorkshire bungled legal paperwork related to parking tickets

All affected parking charges have now been suspended while the council try to obtain an emergency legal order.

The local authority is expected to miss out on around £200,000 in lost revenue while the issue is resolved and will have to hand back at least the same amount for wrongly imposed fines and unnecessarily bought tickets.

The blunder has caused anger amongst local residents, who claim strict parking enforcement in the town centre has hit local businesses.

Andy Thorpe told the Halifax Courier: 'My son was half an hour late back to his car and it was towed away and we had to pay £180 to get it back.

'He's also been done for being 10 or 15 minutes late back and he had to pay, or actually I had to pay because I'm his dad, £30. It is utterly disgusting the price of the charging that they've been doing.'

The council has had to set up a special phone line as residents flood it with calls about refunds for tickets and fines.

Council leader Stephen Baines said: 'The decision was made because it became clear that our traffic regulation orders for these areas cannot be legally enforced.

'There have been some errors in all the background information on these orders - they were small errors, but they were sufficient to make them unenforceable.

'This doesn't affect the car parks, loading bays, double yellow lines or disabled bays, because they're under a different order.

'We are taking steps to make sure all of the parking charges are suspended and no tickets will be issued for these spaces.'

Calderdale Council have been forced to suspend parking restrictions in Halifax town centre after the error, meaning they will miss out on an estimated £200,000 in lost revenue

Council officials are now looking into to whether the issue could affect parking fines and charges in other streets in the area. 

The council will still issue Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) where cars are parked on yellow lines, in loading bays, in disabled bays and in car parks.

There is a fine of £70 for the more serious parking offences like parking on double yellow lines. This is reduced to £35 if paid within 14 days

There is also a fine of £50 for offences like not displaying a parking ticket, which is reduced to £25 if paid within 14 days.

Calderdale Council's Director of Economy and Environment, Ian Gray said: 'Traffic regulation orders are highly technical documents and this issue only came to light after one of our orders was challenged.

'When we checked the details it became clear that there were errors within the orders, which date back to 2008. 

The council is expected to have to re-pay a further £200,000 to drivers who were wrongly given a parking ticket

He added:'When we realised there was a problem we immediately stopped issuing penalty charge notices in the affected areas.

'We are also switching off the parking meters in those streets so that they can no longer accept payments - we expect that this work will be completed by 8 October 2014.'

'The charges for on-street pay and display parking, and for some residents' parking in these areas have now been temporarily suspended.

'As the old order was unenforceable, drivers who have received a PCN after parking in the affected streets will be able to request a refund. We will write directly to all affected residents in Skircoat.

'We are now checking that the TROs which cover other areas of Calderdale are correct.

'We have started to review these but as they are very detailed, complex documents it will take several months for us to complete this assessment. As soon as we have more information we will make this public.' 

What happened? The council lost an appeal against a parking charge notice (PCN) and uncovered a number of errors in the notices for two areas; Skircoat and Halifax town centre.

Who can claim money back? Those who were issued with a PCN or bought a pay and display ticket in one of the affected streets.

What do they have to do? Anyone with a fine will have to provide their registration number and PCN number or evidence of the fine such as a receipt or bank statement. Those who paid for a parking need to provide a valid original pay and display ticket. Photocopies are not being accepted.

How long will it take people to get their money back? The council says it will pay refunds within 90 days of a claim being verified.

How are the council paying for the refunds and lost revenue? Local officials say they will dip into an emergency fund to cover the costs.
