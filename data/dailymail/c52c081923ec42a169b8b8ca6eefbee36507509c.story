This little munchkin has got the moves, the voice and the blonde fringe to boot.

Aged two, she is becoming the ultimate internet sensation after mock-singing Taylor Swift's 'Shake It Off' as it blares on the radio.

Take a look as she wriggles and jiggles while strapped into her car seat and pulls a series of faces that are bound to make you go gooey-eyed. 

As she kicks her legs rhythmically and opens her mouth in time to the music (kind of), it is obvious that the toddler never wants the party to stop. 

She is a star in her own right, closing her eyes to concentrate as she emulates her American idol's sass.

What's more, her pigtails, pink outfit and polka dotted wellington boots just add to the general 'awww' factor of the moment.

It seems 'Shake it off' really is the car jam of the season, with a police officer also rising to stardom after his energetic rendition of the song.

The Dover Police Department in Delaware released the video of the department's officer of 19 years, Jeff Davion on YouTube on Wednesday and it has since earned more than 16 million views. 

A statement from the department read: 'We decided we would share some with you in a new Web series called "DashCam Confessionals". We hope you enjoy this...and Taylor Swift, if you're watching...we're sorry.' 

His version even caught the singer's attention, leading her to Tweet 'LOLOLOLOL THE SASS' after getting her hands on a copy of the priceless clip.

If a big bald cop has managed to get through to the queen of pop, there's no doubt this little lady will charm the socks off of her too.

Belt it! She closes her eyes as she pretends to sing with passion and her dance moves are ridiculously cute
