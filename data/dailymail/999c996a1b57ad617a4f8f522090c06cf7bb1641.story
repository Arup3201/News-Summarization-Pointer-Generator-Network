Clayton Lockett spent forty minutes writhing in agony before dying of a heart attack

A death row inmate spent forty minutes writhing in agony before dying of a heart attack following a new cocktail of drugs administered in a lethal injection on Tuesday night.  

Oklahoma prison officials halted Clayton Lockett's execution after the experimental drug left the man writhing and clenching his teeth on the gurney.

The 38-year-old, who was found guilty of shooting a woman and watching his friends bury her alive, was declared unconscious ten minutes after the first of the state's new three-drug lethal injection combination was administered.

Three minutes later, though, he began breathing heavily, writhing, clenching his teeth and straining to lift his head off the pillow.

It later emerged his vein had ruptured.

The blinds were eventually lowered to prevent those in the viewing gallery from watching what was happening in the death chamber, and the state's top prison official eventually called a halt to the proceedings. 

Lockett died of a heart attack a short time later, the Department of Corrections said. 

Local media present said Mr Lockett sat up and said 'something’s wrong' 13 minutes into the procedure.

'It was a horrible thing to witness. This was totally botched,' said Lockett's attorney, David Autry.

Witness Ziva Branstetter told broadcaster MSNBC Lockett was thrashing about and appeared to be in pain.

'His
 body was sort of bucking. He was clenching his jaw. Several times he 
mumbled phrases that were largely unintelligible,' she said.

A Tulsa World newspaper claimed that Lockett was 'still alive,' and lifted his head as prison officials lowered the blinds.

Tuesday was the first time Oklahoma used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug combination.

Other
 states have used it before; Florida administers 500 milligrams of 
midazolam as part of its three-drug combination. Oklahoma used 100 
milligrams of that drug.

Republican Gov. Mary Fallin ordered stay of execution for Charles Warner who was scheduled to die two hours after Lockett

'They should have anticipated possible problems with an untried execution protocol,' Autry said.

'Obviously
 the whole thing was gummed up and botched from beginning to end. 
Halting the execution obviously did Lockett no good.'

Republican
 Gov. Mary Fallin ordered a 14-day stay of execution for an inmate who 
was scheduled to die two hours after Lockett, Charles Warner.

She
 also ordered the state's Department of Corrections to conduct a 'full 
review of Oklahoma's execution procedures to determine what happened and
 why during this evening's execution.'

Robert
 Patton, the department's director, halted Lockett's execution about 20 
minutes after the first drug was administered.

He later said there had 
been vein failure.

The execution began at 6:23 p.m., when officials began administering the first drug, the sedative midazolam.

A doctor declared Lockett to be unconscious at 6:33 p.m.

Once
 an inmate is declared unconscious, the state's execution protocol calls
 for the second drug, a paralytic, to be administered.

The third drug in the protocol is potassium chloride, which stops the heart.

6:23 p.m. - The injection process begins. Lockett has heavy, slow blinks, laid still

6:29 p.m. - Consistently closed his eyes

6:30 p.m. - First check of consciousness; still conscious

6:33 p.m. - Announced Lockett was officially unconscious

6:34 p.m. - Lockett started to move his mouth

6:36 p.m. - Lockett began convulsing and mumbling

6:37 p.m. - Lockett sat up and said 'something's wrong'

6:39 p.m. - Prison officials lowered the blinds

7:06 p.m. - Lockett dies of massive heart attack

Patton
 said the second and third drugs were being administered when a problem 
was noticed.

He said it's unclear how much of the drugs made it into the
 inmate's system.

Lockett began writhing at 6:36. At 6:39, a doctor lifted the sheet that was covering the inmate to examine the injection site.

'There
 was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having that 
(desired) effect, and the doctor observed the line at that time and 
determined the line had blown,' Patton said at a news conference 
afterward, referring to Lockett's vein rupturing.

After an official lowered the blinds, Patton made a series of phone calls before calling a halt to the execution.

'After
 conferring with the warden, and unknown how much drugs went into him, 
it was my decision at that time to stop the execution,' Patton told 
reporters.

Lockett was declared dead at 7:06 p.m.

Autry,
 Lockett's attorney, was immediately skeptical of the department's 
determination the issue was limited to a problem with Lockett's vein.

'I'm
 not a medical professional, but Mr. Lockett was not someone who had 
compromised veins,' Autry said.

'He was in very good shape. He had large
 arms and very prominent veins.'

Bailey Elise McBride, who reports for the Associated Press in their Oklahoma bureau, tweeted immediately after the botched execution

'After weeks of Oklahoma refusing to 
disclose basic information about the drugs for tonight's lethal 
injection procedures, tonight Clayton Lockett was tortured to death,' 
said Madeline Cohen, an attorney for Warner.

Adam
 Leathers, co-chair of the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death 
Penalty, accused the state of having 'tortured a human being in an 
unconstitutional experimental act of evil,' reported CNN.

In
 Ohio, the January execution of an inmate who made snorting and gasping 
sounds led to a civil rights lawsuit by his family and calls for a 
moratorium.

Nightmare: Patton said the inmate was writhing on the gurney, pictured, and shaking uncontrollably about 13 minutes into the execution

Tuesday was the first time Oklahoma 
used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug 
combination.

Other states have used it before; Florida administers 500 
milligrams of midazolam as part of its three-drug combination. Oklahoma 
used 100 milligrams.

The 
problems with the execution are likely to fuel more debate about the 
ability of states to administer lethal injections that meet the U.S. 
Constitution's requirement they be neither cruel nor unusual punishment.

That question has 
drawn renewed attention from defense attorneys and death penalty 
opponents in recent months, as several states scrambled to find new 
sources of execution drugs because drugmakers that oppose capital 
punishment - many based in Europe - have stopped selling to prisons and 
corrections departments.

Defense
 attorneys have unsuccessfully challenged several states' policies of 
shielding the identities of the new sources of their execution drugs. 
Missouri and Texas, like Oklahoma, have both refused to reveal their 
sources, but both of those states have since successfully carried out 
executions with their new supplies.

The state has stood by the execution but said Monday that it's boosting the dosages of its lethal injection drugs.

A
 four-time felon, Lockett was convicted of shooting 19-year-old 
Stephanie Neiman with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two 
accomplices buried her alive in rural Kay County in 1999 after Neiman 
and a friend arrived at a home the men were robbing.

Warner had been scheduled to be put to death two hours later in the same room and on the same gurney.

The 46-year-old was convicted of raping and killing his roommate's 11-month-old daughter in 1997.

He has maintained his innocence.

Lockett
 and Warner had sued the state for refusing to disclose details about 
the execution drugs, including where Oklahoma obtained them.

The
 case, filed as a civil matter, placed Oklahoma's two highest courts at 
odds and prompted calls for the impeachment of state Supreme Court 
justices after the court last week issued a rare stay of execution.

The
 high court later dissolved its stay and dismissed the inmates' claim 
that they were entitled to know the source of the drugs.

By
 then, Fallin had issued a stay of her own - a one-week delay in 
Lockett's execution that resulted in both men being scheduled to die on 
the same day.

Warner was served a final meal Tuesday of 20 boneless chicken wings, potato wedges, cole slaw, two fruit cocktail cups and a 20-ounce soda.

Lockett's request of steak, shrimp, a large baked potato and a Kentucky Bourbon pecan pie was denied because it exceeded the $15 limit.

He declined a separate offer from the warden for a dinner from Western Sizzlin', prison officials said.

Oklahoma changed its execution protocols twice this year, leaving State officials with five options for lethal injections, including a new three-drug mixture that was used for the first time Tuesday.

Two of the drugs used carry warnings that they can suppress the respiratory system and the third warns that cardiac trouble can occur at high but non-lethal doses, and lists specific steps to take if a medical patient receives too much of the drug but doesn't die.
