Marouane Fellaini insists he never lost the belief that he could cut it at Manchester United and says Louis van Gaal has been 'fantastic' for him.

The Belgian midfielder became synonymous with United's struggles in a disastrous 2013-14 season under David Moyes, who was sacked in April.

At £27.5million, Fellaini was Moyes' only signing in the summer of 2013 but he struggled badly with form and fitness as United could only finish seventh in the Premier League.

This season has seen Fellaini play a starring role under Van Gaal, however, as United have recorded six successive wins to move up to third.

'Some of the newspapers said that Van Gaal didn't want me, but I knew the truth,' the 27-year-old told The Times. 'When he spoke to me he told me that he wanted me to show him that I could play.

'That was it. After that, I showed myself in training and then I started to play.

'The manager did not push me out as some people suggested he would, he has given me a chance to play and important part in his team and he has supported me.

'He has been fantastic for me.

'When I play, he gives me a role and gives me confidence. This has really helped me but I never lost belief that I could be a good player for United.'
