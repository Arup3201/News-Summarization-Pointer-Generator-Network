She's rocked a tuxedo on the red carpet and her best friends dub her a 'complete tomboy' so it made perfect sense for DKNY to tap Cara Delevingne for their menswear campaign.

The supermodel looks stylish in an androgynous suit teamed with her signature sneakers as she poses in the high-fashion shoot alongside male models Ben Nordberg, Jackson Hale and Sang Woo Kim.

Cara Delevingne may have a list of girlfriends that includes Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Suki Waterhouse, Taylor Swift and Georgia-May Jagger but in this new campaign for DKNY she's proving she's just one of the boys.

We love an androgynous suit on a pretty girl and Cara is really showing that a masculine look can be just as sexy as a tight little black dress. And if you ever wondered what to wear with a tailored trouser suit then take a leaf out of the Brit supermodel's style notebook and ditch heels or brogues for a pair of platform trainers.

These sky high sneakers are of course by DKNY and are the perfect foil for an otherwise serious look. And if you fancy giving them a go then click the link (right) to buy an all-black version straight from the DKNY online store now.

You'll be taller with supermodel-esque legs but still be comfortable... really, what's not to love? And they're in the sale so it's a win-win-win situation.

Proving her worth, Cara also lends her good looks to the womenswear campaign.

This isn't Cara's first campaign for the brand. Just last week she was unveiled as the solo star of the DKNY Spring 2015 intimates campaign.

The model and actress, who collaborated with the high-end brand to design a capsule range containing 15 pieces last year, showed off her toned body in the images. 

Talking about her input into her DKNY range, the model told WWD at the time: 'They always encouraged my design input, my personal style and my ideas from the very beginning of our working relationship.

'DKNY is urban and edgy, but, most of all, it's individual. They truly embrace the weirdness in all of us, so you can really be yourself.' 

Cara has been keeping busy and recently attended a string of glitzy showbiz parties over in Los Angeles, where she's been hanging out with her best friend Kendall Jenner.
