England's 1-0 win over Norway might not have been very well-received but Roy Hodgson will hope it has provided a platform for a successful Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

The squad were boarding a train at Watford Junction on Thursday morning, and heading to St George's Park to prepare for a trip to Switzerland on Monday evening and the start of their journey to the European Championship in France.

There weren't many smiles on display on the northbound platform as England's players waited to be taken to Staffordshire.

Half-empty: Only 40,000 people turned up to see England play Norway at Wembley on Wednesday night

Bright spot: A single Wayne Rooney penalty was enough to see off Norway, but England struggled

Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Gary Cahill and James Milner were just some of the stars waiting to board in their training kits.

Hodgson's side beat Norway on Wednesday night at a half-empty Wembley thanks to a Rooney penalty, which was one of just two England shots on target. 

The 40,181 attendance was the lowest Wembley has seen for an England international since it re-opened in 2007.  

England travel to Switzerland on Monday and also face San Marino, Slovenia, Estonia and Lithuania in Group E.

On Tuesday morning they will hope their bid to reach France in two years' time is on track.
