Newcastle United will complete the loan signing of Shakhtar Donetsk striker Facundo Ferreyra early next week but manager Alan Pardew has concerns at the other end of the pitch.

The Magpies were beaten 3-1 by Malaga in Gelsenkirchen on Saturday as an inept first-half defensive display allowed the La Liga side to race into a three-goal lead.

Pardew took responsibility for the loss – blaming himself for naming a young team – but his back four was made up of skipper Fabricio Coloccini, the experienced Steven Taylor, Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa – a £6.7million signing – and highly-rated left-back Massadio Haidara.

And the Newcastle boss said: 'I take full responsibility for that first half. It was perhaps a bit too young, so I blame myself for that defeat.

'I put two young lads up the top and maybe it was too much inexperience to cope with a team like Malaga.

'It was Moussa (Sissoko) and (Remy) Cabella's first game so really I'm kicking myself because I should have had a bit more experience on.'

Sergi Darder blasted the opener from distance on 25 minutes before 19-year-old Samu Castillejo helped himself to a double, the first an unmarked volley from eight yards and the second a stunner from the angle of the area.

Gabriel Obertan fired a consolation but the former Manchester United winger has already been told he can leave the club.

One player definitely coming in is Ferreyra, the 23-year-old Argentinian who will join on a season-long loan having refused to return to Ukraine amid the political unrest and violence in the country.
