Westminster could lose its status as a world heritage site because London's latest skyscrapers are set to ruin the view.

Unesco has been asked by advisors to consider putting the area on its endangered list when its world heritage committee gathers for its annual meeting next week in Cambodia.

Inclusion on the endangered list is the first step towards a place being delisted, which would be highly embarrassing for the UK if it were seen to be neglecting the care of one of its cultural treasures.

Westminster could be placed on the endangered list for world heritage sites if towering developments south of the Thames go ahead, according to Unesco

The development of two glass towers, one hitting 400ft, at Elizabeth House at Waterloo has been singled out for criticism by Unesco, who say it ruins the backdrop of the view from Westminster (artist's impression)

The United Kingdom has 28 Unesco-listed world heritage sites, chosen for their outstanding significance for culture or the natural world. There are only 962 such sites in the world.

The Westminster site includes the Palace of Westminster, home to the House of Commons and the House of Lords, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and Saint Margaret's Church - the parish church of the Commons.

Unesco is concerned about building projects at Waterloo, Nine Elms, Elephant and Castle and Vauxhall in south London ruining the backdrop of the view of Westminster.

The 400ft and 29-storey North tower of the Elizabeth House development across Waterloo Bridge have been singled out for particular criticism by Unesco, with the 173ft South tower standing ten storeys high.

'In some views, part of the development would appear to be visually attached to the north face of the Queen Elizabeth Tower (formerly known as St Stephenâ€™s Tower, which houses Big Ben),' says Unesco in its agenda for next week's meeting.

It repeats concerns from 2006 and 2011 over the lack of a 'buffer zone' preventing building work around the area.

English Heritage has warned that the development would ruin 'views from the Westminster World Heritage Site and 
the proposal would intrude heavily on views of Big Ben, one of London's 
most easily identifiable and much-loved landmarks and a Grade I listed 
building'.

Westminster Abbey, where British monarchs are crowned, is part of the world heritage site

The 15th century Saint Margaret's Church, known as the 'parish church of the Commons', is also part of the under-threat site

Unesco also criticises the Government for not doing enough when it comes to rules and policy to make sure new developments do not ruin the sites.

The meeting agenda recommends that the 
committee 'consider placing the property on the List of World Heritage 
in Danger in 2014, should the foreseen development projects be approved 
as currently planned'.

Earlier this year, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected calls to force work at Elizabeth House to be stopped.

Two years ago the committee considered 
putting the Tower of London on the endangered list because its 'visual 
integrity' was at risk from new buildings in the area.

It asked the 
Government not to approve plans for more construction without 
considering the risk of losing world heritage status.

Elsewhere in the UK, the status of Giant's Causeway in 
Northern Ireland as a place of global cultural or natural importance is 
under threat from the building of a golf course, while a new supermarket
could cost Hayle Harbour in Cornwall its title.
