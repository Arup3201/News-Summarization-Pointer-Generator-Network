Roma manager Rudi Garcia looks like the pressure could be getting to him after mocking photographers in his press conference ahead of hosting Bayern Munich on Tuesday.

The Frenchman took a camera off a photographer to imitate the snapping of cameras, seemingly frustrated with the incessant level of noise whilst attempting to answer questions from journalists.

Garcia then refused to repeat one particular answer as he presumed, in a sarcastic manner, that the reporters could hear him speaking.

The 50-year-old could be feeling the strain as his side host undefeated Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Garcia has become a hit with the Italian media since joining Roma in 2013, especially since he started dating Francesca Brienza who presents on the clubâ€™s in-house TV channel.

Roma, including former Chelsea star Ashley Cole, defeated Chievo 3-0 at the weekend in Serie A to remain second and in touch with Juventus at the top.
