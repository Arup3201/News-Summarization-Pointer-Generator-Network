A Toronto woman who simulated pregnancy to try to smuggle 2 kilograms of cocaine was arrested today at Bogota airport by Colombian police.

Col. Esteban Arias says 28-year-old Tabitha Leah Ritchie was stopped while trying to board an Air Canada flight in Bogota after an inspector noted that her belly was unusually cold and hard.

He says police discovered a false belly made of latex taped to her body and they found 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of cocaine.
