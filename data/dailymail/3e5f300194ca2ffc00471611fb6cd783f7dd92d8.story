Determined: Adam Afriyie with his wife Tracy-Jane

David Cameron must stop pussyfooting around and heed voters fed-up with him on immigration and the EU.

Thursday’s local elections results were disappointing for the Conservative Party. No one can deny that. We lost many hard-working councillors and other parties, including UKIP, made an unsettling number of gains.

The results were also a potential disaster for voters. In my Windsor constituency we have the lowest council tax rate outside of London and some of the best public services.

There is now a danger the council tax freeze by Conservative authorities up and down the country could be reversed by newly elected Labour councillors.

But the electorate have spoken and I want us to listen. As a party, we need to ask ourselves some serious questions: Why did voters in Conservative strongholds feel the party was no longer on their side?

Why did some voters lose faith in the party to deliver a bright and vibrant future for the country?

I have been a grassroots Conservative for more than 25 years. I know what our party stands for. We want smaller government; we want to unleash the transformative power of enterprise; we want simpler, lower taxes and we want to put Britain first in everything it does.

But, right now, our strong and popular message does not seem to be reaching the public – we must start tackling the issues that matter to people.

People no longer believe we have the grit, determination and political will to deal with the problems of immigration and Europe. They feel their country is careering down a slippery slope towards membership of a giant federal Europe – a new nation super-state that they did not agree to join.

They see British legislation replaced by new EU laws, and all they hear is: ‘It’s an EU regulation – we can’t do anything about it.’

Now, if we want to control our borders, we need prior permission from unelected European commissioners.

But getting a grip on immigration is essential if we are going to stand up for the interests of our citizens. High levels of immigration put severe pressure on UK public services and infrastructure, push up the cost of housing and put a strain on the job market.

In my view there are four major groups of immigrants: Illegal, asylum seekers, people working here legally on work visas and students. Of course, tourists regularly visit the UK too.

Illegal immigrants should be deported. Tourists and genuine students should be welcomed with open arms – because every pound they spend in Britain, on our high streets or in our universities, contributes to this country’s long-term prosperity.

Next, we must make sure that people here on working visas are net contributors to Britain – that they are adding to the Treasury and contributing to British public services.

That is why I propose mandatory health insurance for all temporary visitors to this country. It could be paid and processed alongside the  normal visa process.

It would relax financial pressure on the NHS and guarantee continued investment where required to deal with the increased load. If the US and Australia can implement an effective health insurance scheme for visitors, why can’t we?

Next, I propose non-British citizens working in the UK pay a tax supplement of, say, two per cent on top of their base-rate income tax. That would guarantee foreign workers are contributing to the upkeep of the UK – contributing to strong British courts, UK defence and vital national services.

But if these measures are to be effective, they must also apply to EU immigrants. The EU is the burdensome, federal elephant in the room. It would be unfair to UK citizens and other non-EU immigrants who are paying their way, if tens of thousands of annual EU immigrants were given a free ride. So we must reject the idea of pan-European citizenship.

Currently, the UK cannot target measures at other EU citizens because we are all ‘citizens of Europe’.

To have any hope of building a better future for Britain we must restore our status as a sovereign country and renegotiate with the EU. And if that fails, we must remember that withdrawal is a serious option.

I want to see a country at ease with itself – an integrated Britain that welcomes hard-working people from wherever. But we must implement policies that ensure working immigrants are net contributors to British life, the British economy and British culture.
