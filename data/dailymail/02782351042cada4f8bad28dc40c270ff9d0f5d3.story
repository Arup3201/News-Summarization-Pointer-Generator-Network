The First World War would not be fought today, according to Jeremy Paxman, because the younger generation are more concerned with their iPhones than any sense of ‘duty’.

The BBC Newsnight host and historian said modern society is too ‘self-obsessed’ and ‘hedonistic’.

Speaking at a literature festival in Dubai, he said the idea of ‘duty’ had now diminished in favour of ‘personal freedom’, adding: ‘What would [the younger] generation fight for? The right to use your iPhone? What are the great noble causes?’

Jeremy Paxman believes a conflict like the First World War would not happen today because society is too 'self-obsessed' and 'hedonistic'

He added: ‘Ideas of duty, clearly strongly felt by many people, have diminished as the international significance of the country has diminished.

‘We live in such a relativistic society now, and materialist, self-obsessed and hedonistic; it’s hard to imagine circumstances under which people would say that “it is worth it, I am willing to risk my life and well-being for this.”’

Mr Paxman, 63, said he had ‘no doubt whatsoever’ that the war would not be fought today but that in his opinion, ‘some things are worth fighting for.’

Paxman also claims that a conflict like the Great War would not happen because of the persuasive presence of social media, which he claims has changed what people are willing to put up with

'Over the top' during the Battle of the Somme. Paxman believes nothing like this war would ever happen again because the young men and women of today have no motivation to fight

‘We have grown up in an environment in which the greatest premium is put on personal freedom,’ he said.

‘Great value, we are told living in a western democracy, is that you can do as you please.

‘It’s a much more difficult challenge to manage that sort of society than the generation that grew up during the First World War.’

He said today’s influence of social media would also hinder any war effort as it has changed what ‘people are prepared to put up with’, adding: ‘I suspect that there would have been so many tweets...and photos of trench digging that public opinion would have caused an end to the business.

The trench would never be dug.’ He also argued that there was a great misunderstanding in the way the First World War was viewed, partly as a result of war poetry such as that by Wilfred Owen and Seigfried Sassoon.

Jeremy Paxman hopes his new show 'Britain's Great War' will change the perception of how much of an impact the conflict had on the U.K, but says he is naive to think he could do it alone

He told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Forget the poems, forget Oh! What a Lovely War, forget Blackadder. Engage with the lives of those who took part in it and think, “What would I have done?”

‘The events now are so built upon by writers and attitudes and propaganda that the actual events seem submerged.

University Challenge host Mr Paxman is currently presenting the BBC One series Britain’s Great War, and accompaniment to his book Great Britain’s Great War’, which looks at the impact the 1914-1918 conflict had on the country.

Michael Gove started a political row when he argued that contrary to the views of academics, the conflict was a 'just war' to combat aggression by a German elite bent on domination

He said he hopes to be able to change perceptions but admits he would be a ‘fool’ if he thought he could do so alone.

He added: ‘So what I wanted to do was re-engage with the events themselves. How did they seem to people at the time?

He said that a ‘difficulty’ of modern education is that so much of what we know about the Great War is taught only as poetry and not history.

‘I think the reason [poetry] is of interest is that it confirms with your prejudices to see the whole thing as a terrible, pointless sacrifice, sure, and the story it was fought for democracy and so on I don’t think it stacks up.

‘But I think that the idea that the whole thing was a conspiracy to throw away young lives is perpetuated by the poets and actually there is much more to it than that.

In January, Education Secretary Michael Gove started a political row when he said television shows like Blackadder peddled ‘left-wing myths’ that the Great War was a ‘misbegotten shambles’.

He argued that contrary to the views of left-wing academics, the conflict was a ‘just war’ to combat aggression by a German elite bent on domination.

He said: ‘The war was, of course, an unspeakable tragedy, which robbed this nation of our bravest and best.

‘But it’s important that we don’t succumb to some of the myths which have grown up about the conflict in the last 70 or so years.

‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder as a misbegotten shambles - a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite.’
