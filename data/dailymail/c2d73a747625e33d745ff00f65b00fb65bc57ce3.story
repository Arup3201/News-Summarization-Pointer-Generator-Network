Huw Jones, 18, admitted drunkenly urinating on a war memorial in Porthmadog, Wales

A teenager who urinated on a war memorial was told by magistrates that ‘boys your age were being killed’ exactly 100 years ago.

Huw Jones, who was spotted drunkenly relieving himself on the steps of the monument, could now face having to clean it as part of his punishment.

The 18-year-old, who had been drinking heavily after a game of rugby, was given a stern lecture in court on the sacrifices made by his forefathers.

‘This was a disgusting offence on the community and the punishment must reflect that,’ Peter Lunt Williams told Jones when he appeared in court in north Wales on Monday.

‘This is a sensitive time – not only is it Remembrance Sunday at the weekend, but it is 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War when boys your age were being killed and injured in their thousands.

‘Last week we saw soldiers returning from Afghanistan and during that war many soldiers were killed and injured.

‘You should be ashamed of yourself and I am sure the community of Porthmadog are not happy at all. Although we can’t order it, we’d like to see you clean the war memorial.’ 

The memorial, which was erected in 1922, records the names of 156 men and women – several of them teenagers – who lost their lives in two world wars. 

It bears a moving verse by a Welsh poet that translates as: ‘Let there be everlasting memory of their costly brave work, for the freedom of the neighbourhood, the civilisation of the world.’

Police officers found Jones urinating on a wall at the war memorial on October 18, magistrates were told

Jones was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid worker and handed a weekend curfew, but will not be forced to clean the war memorial

Among the names is that of David Morris Williams, who was a 32-year-old cook on a merchant ship sunk by a German U-boat in the Bay of Biscay in April 1917.

Last night his granddaughter, Carol Foster, who lives near Porthmadog, said: ‘I cannot understand the mentality of anyone who desecrates war memorials in this way, and I wonder whether people like this fully understand the significance of war memorials, or even care?

‘I have only recently found out what my grandfather looked like, and also more about how he died during the First World War. The fact that his name is on the Porthmadog memorial means a huge amount to me.’

Diane Williams, prosecuting, told Caernarvon magistrates that PC Kevin Roberts saw Jones urinating on a wall at the top of the memorial steps on the afternoon of October 18.

The jobless joiner admitted outraging public decency and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work, put on a curfew for eight weeks and told to attend an alcohol counselling class.

His solicitor, Carys Parry, said: ‘He had been drinking alcohol and did not think what he was doing. He did not mean to be disrespectful and apologises for what he has done.’ The hearing was adjourned while prosecutors seek a criminal behaviour order requiring him to clean the memorial regularly.

Local poppy seller Ifan Buckley, 83, said: ‘They should have locked him up – or put him in the Army and let them teach him some respect. At 18, he’s old enough to know better.’

A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said: ‘War memorials honour the memory of the British armed forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice and those who defend the freedom we enjoy. They deserve to be treated with the utmost respect.’

The memorial will form the centrepiece of Porthmadog’s Remembrance events this weekend.

In 2009, student Philip Laing was told he had narrowly avoided being jailed after he was pictured urinating over poppy wreaths at a memorial in Sheffield after a drunken night out run by the infamous Carnage organisation.The 19-year-old was instead ordered to carry out community service. 

The minimum age to enlist in the Army during the First World War was 18 but many children lied about their age in order to join the fighting with the result that boys as young as 14 died in combat.

According to one historian, 250,000 signed up for the Army despite being underage and many of them were sent home without seeing action when they were found out.

Recruiting sergeants were paid two shillings and sixpence for everyone who enlisted following the outbreak of war, and with the minimum height being only 5ft 3in it was easy for taller teenagers to lie about their ages. Among those who slipped through the net was Sidney Lewis, who was just five months past his 12th birthday when he enlisted with the East Surrey Regiment in August 1915. He was fighting on the Somme by the age of 13.

The youngest killed in action is believed to be Private John Condon who was also 12 when he lied about his age to recruiters in Waterford, Ireland.

He died two years later in the Second Battle of Ypres and his grave is now among the most visited on the Western Front.

Boys could be sent to sea by the Royal Navy when they were just 16, while the mercantile marine took them from even younger ages, facing the perils of the German U-boat campaign.

The youngest recipient of the Victoria Cross was John Travers Cornwell from East London who was just 16 when he suffered fatal injuries at the Battle of Jutland in July 1916.

The ‘boy first class’ had remained at his post on HMS Chester when it came under heavy shellfire from German cruisers.

Analysis of First World War casualty records from one regiment found one in eight were killed when they were 19 – the most dangerous age – but 4 per cent were 18 or under.
