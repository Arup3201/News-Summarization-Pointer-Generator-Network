Tottenham target Yevhen Konoplykana has revealed his interest in a move to Roma and says that the Serie A side and his club Dnipro have an agreement in place.

The winger, who scored a stunning goal against England at Wembley, is in high demand - with a number of clubs including Liverpool credited with an interest. 

But the Ukraine international insists that despite an agreement between the clubs, talk of an immediate move is premature.

Yevhen Konoplyanka has revealed his interest in move to Roma but insists that he has yet to agree a move 

 The Dnipro star was previously close to a move to Liverpool in the summer but the move fell through

'I know there was talk that there would be a medical soon, but that's not true,' the Ukrainian international told Gazzetta dello Sport.

'I promised the President that I'd stay at Dnipro until the end of my contract. As I understand it, the two clubs have reached an agreement, but not with me.

'That's why the deal hasn't been completed.

'I like Roma though, they're a big European club. I'm convinced that in the next few days my future will be decided.'

The tricky winger scored a stunning goal against England at Wembley back in 2012 

Konoplyanka's deal with the Russian club runs out in the summer and he could wait to make a decision
