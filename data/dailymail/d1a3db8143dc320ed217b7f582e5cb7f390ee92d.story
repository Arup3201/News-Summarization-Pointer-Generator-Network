A 20-year-old from Arizona arrested for running over and killing her boyfriend last month told police she thought her car had hit a pole.

Brittney Nolan is accused of running into Jacob Rice in the early hours of January 25 after the couple had an argument at a party.

A jogger discovered the body of Rice, 20, near a cycle lane of a north Phoenix road the following morning.

Tragic: Brittney Nolan was arrested for hit and run charges over the death of her boyfriend, Jacob Rice

Nolan has admitted that she was driving at the time of the incident but said she didn't realize she had hit anyone.

She pleaded not guilty to leaving the scene of an accident when she appeared in Maricopa County Superior Court on Thursday.

According to court documents seen by AZ Central, Nolan had been trying to use her cellphone to call Mr Rice when she felt her car hit something.

Believing she had struck a pole, Nolan continued to her apartment, where police found her the following day.

Although she showed no sign of impairment when police spoke to her the next day, Nolan allegedly told police she had been drinking during a desert party.Â 

Friends of the couple told Fox8 they had argued at Nolan's apartment and Rice had decided to walk home.

Memorial: Friends left a lasso, photos and candles at the site where Jacob died

Family and friends have created a roadside memorial, leaving a lasso, photos and candles for the 20-year-old, who enjoyed taking part in rodeos.

'He never really took anything for granted. He was always a happy kid. Always happy, always smiling,' Shag Moris told Az Family as he visited the memorial.

Tommy Koeckes added: 'He was a fantastic person and didn't deserve the outcome of his life so far.'
