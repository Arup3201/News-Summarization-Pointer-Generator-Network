Rupert Murdoch was jostled by protesters and criticised by disgruntled shareholders who demanded the mogul and his sons resign from his scandal-hit newspaper empire.

The 80-year-old chairman and CEO of News Corp was condemned for his  handling of the phone hacking scandal.

At the company's annual meeting in Los Angles some of his biggest investors voted against his re-election and that of his sons, James and Lachlan as directors.

More than 100 protesters, one of whom wore a Murdoch mask, gathered 
outside the 20th Century Fox studio lot where the tycoon robustly defended himself.

Inside,
seated in the front row with his sons, he warded 
off allegations that he had poor oversight of the company, sometimes 
cutting off speakers to dispute a fact.

He insisted News Corp's history was the 'stuff of legend,' but shareholders were critical of his £21 million salary ($33million). 

Votes from the shareholders were still being counted but the company said a proposal from the Christian Brothers Investment Services to force the company's chairman to be an independent director had failed.

James Murdoch was likely to receive the biggest vote of no confidence. If the votes go against him, it will cast further doubts on his future at the company.

The youngest Murdoch son is already 
facing questions about evidence he gave to a parliamentary inquiry into 
the News of the World hacking scandal and shareholders at 
Murdoch-controlled BSkyB have called for his resignation.

Those attending included Edward Mason, secretary of the ethical investment advisory group of the Church of England, which owns about $6m worth of News Corp shares.

He said: 'There needs to be decisive action in terms of holding people to account.'

Julie Tanner, assistant director of Christian Brothers Investment Services which represents more than 1,000 Catholic institutions worldwide, was the first at the meeting to question Murdoch's track record.

She said that the 'extraordinary scandals' in the UK required corporate overhaul.

Few held out any hope they could 
overcome Murdoch's control of 40 percent of voting shares through a 
family trust, or the seven per cent stake Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal 
has almost certainly cast in support of him.

Stephen Mayne, an Australian shareholder and long-time critic of Murdoch, said it was an 'extraordinarily paranoid" meeting.

'I think he's losing it, he comes across as a paranoid control freak,' he added.

Something to shout about: Protesters have been a common sight an News Corp functions since the phone hacking scandal broke in July

There has been global outrage over 
the discovery that a private investigator hired by the newspaper had 
hacked into the mobile phone voicemail of 13-year-old murder victim 
Milly Dowler, potentially impeding a police investigation and giving 
false hope to her family.

The phone hacking scandal has forced 
the resignation of two of London's top police officers and ousted top 
executives such as Dow Jones & Co. CEO Les Hinton and former Sun 
Editor Rebekah Brooks.

It also claimed the job of Prime Minister David Cameron's former spin doctor, Andy Coulson, an ex-News of the World editor.

The
company also announced on Friday that it had agreed to pay £2 million 
($3.2 million) to the family of Milly Dowler and £1 million ($1.6 
million) to charities of their choice.

Friday marked the first time Murdoch faced shareholders with small stakes in the company since the scandal broke in July.

Outside the studio lot, some demonstrators carried anti-Murdoch signs, including one that stated 'Fire the Murdoch Mafia'. Another read, 'Rich media equals poor democracy'.

Some of the demonstrators were from an organisation that has been staging rallies recently to demand good jobs.

Tom Watson, a Labour MP in Britain, flew to Los Angeles to make a new allegation about covert surveillance techniques by company employees.

Watson asked Murdoch if he was aware that a person who had left prison was hired by News Corp's British newspaper unit and hacked into the computer of a former army intelligence officer.

He later said the incident happened around 2005 and that evidence of the computer hacking is with London's Metropolitan Police. He said it could lead to the discovery of further victims of computer hacking.

He warned News Corp investors that they were facing 'Mulcaire 2' in the UK as victims of alleged computer hacking took action against its subsidiary News International.

He added: 'You haven't told any of your investors what is to come.

Murdoch said he wasn't aware of the allegation, and board director Viet Dinh said the company would look into it.

Mr Murdoch said: 'I promise you absolutely that we will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this and put it right.'
