A mother who police say is to blame for a crash that killed her daughter, nephew and four other people faces charges after she was pulled alive from the wreckage.

Kathy Douglas, 36, is in serious condition along with her ten-year-old son after the accident, which happened when her SUV crossed into oncoming traffic on a rural Pennslyvania highway and hit a sedan killing its four occupants.Â 

Her daughter Olivia, 12, and her nephew Jarrett Costanzo were killed on impact in the rural north west of the state.

The investigating police officer told Fox News that he believed Douglas was at fault and expects her to face charges.

Ms Douglas is in critical condition at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Hamot in Erie. Her son was also seriously injured but is recovering at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Three of the dead were not wearing seat belts, police said.

Tragic: Kathy Douglas, the driver of the SUV, survived. Her daughter Olivia, 12, was killed and her son, 10, was badly injured

The accident happened about 4.30pm on Saturday on U.S. Route 219 in Allegheny National Forest when Ms Douglas' Jeep Liberty drifted across the center line and slammed into an oncoming Pontiac Bonneville sedan.

All four occupants of the Pontiac were killed on impact. The victims are: driver, Gary Beimel, 62, and passengers David Cuneo, 54, Elaine Beimel, 55, and Florence Donachy, 81. All four were residents of St. Marys, Pennsylvania.

Police do no know what caused Ms Douglas to veer into oncoming traffic on the highway.

Ms Douglas' nephew, Jarrett Costanzo, 6, was also killed

Pennsylvania State Trooper Roger McCloskey, said he believes Douglas was at fault and will face some sort of charges.

'I have no idea yet, but the investigation is continuing,' he said Sunday.

The two dead children from Ms Douglas' SUV were identified as Douglas' 6-year-old nephew, Jarrett Costanzo, and 12-year-old daughter, Olivia Douglas.

Jarrett
 was a student at Kane Area Elementary School, said Sam Cummings, who 
works at the funeral home. The funerals for both children might be held 
together, he said.

Cummings said the injured boy was flown to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

'I think he's doing OK,' Cummings said.

Police
 said Douglas and Gary Beimel were wearing seatbelts, but at least three
 of the deceased - including at least one of the children - were not.

McKean
 County Coroner Michael Cahill said all six were declared dead at the 
scene of the wreck, and all died from blunt force trauma injuries.

Rural: The crash happened on stretch of sparsely-populated highway in the Allegheny National Forest

No autopsies were planned, and Cahill released the remains to funeral homes Sunday.

Arrangements for the four occupants of Beimel's vehicle were being handled by Lynch-Green Funeral Home Inc. in St. Marys, the coroner said. A message left for Lynch-Green was not immediately returned.

Police said both vehicles were severely damaged, and U.S. Route 219 was closed in both directions for more than six hours.
