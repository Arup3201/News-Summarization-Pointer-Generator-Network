As the foreman stood up to return the verdict of the jury, the four siblings squeezed each other’s hands in silence and hung their heads as if in quiet prayer.

But as the jury found Michael Le Vell not guilty of raping a child, the actor’s brother and three sisters who had sat quietly in the public gallery throughout the eight-day trial could not hold back their emotions and cried out with relief.

They screamed ‘Yes’, and sobbed unashamedly as their little brother was cleared of all the charges.

They scrambled from court and ran towards Le Vell, 48, where all three embraced him simultaneously and cried hysterically.

The family were ushered into a consultation room, but the women’s sobs could be heard through the thick wooden door.

Glenis Gill, 60, Susan Westcott, 54, Julie Turner, 51, and Phil Turner, 61, never  wavered in their support for their youngest sibling and had never doubted his innocence.

And yesterday, Le Vell emerged from Manchester Crown Court flanked by the four people who had carried him through the last few months.

Miss Turner had flown from Jordan to be with Le Vell, while his brother, a teacher, had travelled from Perth in Australia.

His eldest sister Linda Simpson passed away from cancer some years ago.

Family support: Le Vell's four older sisters helped look after him when he was a teenager after his mother died

Le Vell’s mother Ellen died from a brain 
tumour when he was 15 and his father Sydney, a lorry driver, succumbed 
to lung cancer when he was 22.

According to his family, it meant his four sisters helped to look after him when he was a teenager.

Actor Nigel Pivaro, who played Terry Duckworth in Coronation Street and is Le Vell’s close friend, said yesterday: ‘He took great comfort from his siblings and that they all believed in him so much and that they were prepared to suffer this ordeal with him.

‘They gave him so much support all the way through and never doubted him.

‘They came from all over the world just to be by his side and show they were with him all the way.’

Le Vell’s aunt spoke of the ‘amazing’ support that he had received from his family.

Sandra Bagshaw-Wainwright, 67, said: ‘We’ve got a really big family and we’ve all been there for him.

‘His sisters have especially been there for him as they’re all really close.

‘None of us believed for a minute that he did it. It’s ridiculous that this was brought against him.’

Le Vell’s aunt Patricia Gallier, 67, said: ‘His three sisters and brother Phil have all been there for him.

Actor Nigel Pivaro, who played Terry Duckworth in the soap, said Le Vell took 'great comfort from his siblings'

‘The sisters have especially been a rock for him throughout his terrible ordeal.

‘But his brother Phil, too, came all the way from Australia for him.

‘He is very close to them all as his parents died so young.

‘He might not have got through them without him.’

After the case, Mrs Westcott, a carer, wiped away tears as she watched her brother give a statement to the Press.

Then the family celebrated the not guilty verdicts with champagne at a nearby hotel.

While the jury deliberated, Mrs Gill had sat nervously outside the court with Mrs Westcott, who lives just a couple of streets away in Oldham.

Mrs Gill, whose daughter Kay McArdle, 34, was also a constant presence during the trial, said: ‘I can’t stand the waiting. I just want it to be over with.’

But after the verdict, the family were happy to smile for the cameras as they drank pints of beer on the terrace of a hotel in the centre of Manchester.

Mrs Gill grinned and pointed to Le Vell, while his brother, other sisters and niece Kay gave the thumbs up and waved.

Commenting on the emotional reaction from Le Vell’s family, Pivaro told the Press afterwards: ‘He was probably calmer than anyone around him.

‘It is a tremendous relief for all his family. Of course, they are incredibly emotional.’
