An Australian man has died while surfing at a popular tourist break off the Indonesian coast at Lombok.

Geoff Moase, 48, was pulled from the water at Sorga Beach in Lombok, east of Bali, on Friday morning after he was spotted floating in the surf by a local fisherman.

Friends of Mr Moase's helped bring him to shore and performed CPR on the 48-year-old who was taken to an Indonesian clinic where he died a short time later.

The Gold Coast surfboard shaper was believed to have been killed by 'a harsh wave,' according to an Indonesian policeman.

'By the time he was pulled from the water, he was already so weak,' West Nusa Tenggara police spokesman Amerun said.

At his Gold Coast workshop, Dovetail Surfboards, Mr Moase crafted unique boards from Australian-grown plantation timbers.

He told the website surfcareers.com prior to his death of the fascination he had with surfing from a young age, describing it as his 'obsession.'

'At least half of it is just being part of a postcard-like scene,' he said.

'Surfing reminds me that I'm lucky to live in a country that's free.'

One of those paying tribute to Mr Moase on Saturday was Burleigh Heads retailer Keith Davis, who saw Mr Moase just before he left for Indonesia.

'Geoff was an inspiring individual who really tried to help people do what they loved doing, and that was surfing,' Mr Davis said.

'He loved helping other people make their surfboards as much as he loved making his own.'

He had been staying in the area for three days, police said.

Meanwhile, on Nusa Lembongan, a small island just off the coast of Bali, the search continues for missing Sunshine Coast man Peter Maynard.

The father-of-three from Noosa was last seen on August 27.

His family, who arrived on the island on Friday, believe he went for a surf on that morning.

Police say the conditions that day were relatively calm.

Mr Moase's death comes after Australian Peter Luke, 27, died after being hit by a huge wave on a remote beach on the island of Sumbawa last month.

Mr Luke, originally from Warrnambool in Victoria, was surfing five-metre waves when his friends lost sight of him, and eventually found his body on a nearby reef.
