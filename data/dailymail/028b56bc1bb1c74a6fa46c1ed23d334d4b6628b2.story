For Serena Williams this victory was a 49-minute stroll that quite probably acted as a timely warm  down from the doubles match she only finished with her sister 15 hours earlier.

The five-time champion swatted aside Chanelle Scheepers, a 30-year-old South African who had only won once at Wimbledon in five attempts, 6-1, 6-1, exhausting about as much energy as she would on the practise grounds of Aorangi.

She and Venus had completed their three-set first-round win at 8.59pm on Wednesday night but opening up on No 1 Court at 1pm was no trouble.

No sweat: Serena Williams celebrates after beating her opponent in just 49 minutes

On the charge: Serena Williams crushed Chanelle Scheepers 6-1, 6-1 on Thursday

No answers: Chanelle Scheepers could not live with the power of Serena Williams

Williams bore her familiar early-round demeanour throughout, the one where it seems as if casting aside lesser players is a minor chore she could do without.

But the 32-year-old brought her game too, slapping a cross-court return with venom to break her opponent’s first service game. There were aces of 112mph and 115mph too.

During her match with Venus she tumbled into the crowd, but there was never going to be any slips here.

‘I was out really late in a super fun doubles match,’ she said. ‘Some wonderful gents caught me as I dove in the crowd. It was so embarrassing I had to laugh about it.’

Alize Cornet is up next in round three. On this form, you suspect there will be little humour for the 25th seed from France.
