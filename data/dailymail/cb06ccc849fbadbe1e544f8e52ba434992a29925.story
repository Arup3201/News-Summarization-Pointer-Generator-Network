Police officers in Ferguson have begun wearing body cameras in an effort to restore trust in the force after the shooting of unarmed teenager Mike Brown.

Officers have been equipped with the cameras after two private companies, Safety Vision and Digital Ally, donated more than 50 of them last week.

Officials say officers first wore the cameras at a protest on Saturday, and captured images of protesters taunting officers.

Civil rights groups have been calling for the introduction of the cameras ever since black teenager Mike Brown was shot by white policeman Darren Wilson on August 9.

After the incident police claimed Brown struggled with Wilson, causing the officer to fire his gun, while witnesses said Brown was in the process of surrendering when he was shot in the head and chest.

The policy of equipping officers with cameras has the support of scores of law enforcement agencies and the American Civil Liberties Union.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the cameras have been well received by officers.

The move is part of a trust-building exercise by Ferguson police as they try to repair their reputation following the shooting of unarmed teenager Mike Brown

'They are really enjoying them,' he said. 'They are trying to get used to using them.'

Safety Vision, one of the companies which donated the cameras, said in a statement it had given the equipment over in the hopes that it could bring transparency to future investigations.

'The city of Ferguson has gone through an unfortunate series of events and Safety Vision body cameras and flashlight DVR will assist in capturing prima facie evidence for investigations involving vandalism, looting, and shots fired,' the statement said.

The death of Mike Brown brought race relations between police and citizens in Ferguson to a head, sparking three weeks of protests that included nightly violence and stores being looted.

Police responded with riot gear and moved in military equipment to try to quell the turmoil.

A St. Louis County grand jury has begun hearing evidence about Brown's killing and the U.S. Justice Department has opened its own investigation.

Meanwhile a Ferguson police officer who caused outrage after pushing a CNN anchor live on air is set to retire on a full pension, it has been reported by MSNBC.

Officer Dan Page drew national media coverage after repeatedly pushing and threatening to arrest CNN reporter Don Lemon during a live broadcast from Ferguson two weeks ago.

A video then emerged of Page speaking at a meeting of a far-right group, calling black people 'little perverts', ranting against Muslims and gays, and branding Barack Obama and illegal immigrant. 

During the hour-long film Page, who was recorded brandishing a bible during a meeting of Oath Keepers, also ranted against women who have abortions and domestic abuse victims.

Page was suspended while authorities investigated, but because he served the force for 35 years he was able to retire on a full pension and benefits.
