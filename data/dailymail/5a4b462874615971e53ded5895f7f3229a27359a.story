Actress Sian Phillips first turned down the role of Oscar Wilde’s imperious Lady Bracknell in The Importance Of Being Earnest 20 years ago because, aged 60 then, she thought she was too old to play the role of a 20-year-old girl’s mother.

Now she has taken on the part at the age of 80 for the latest West End stage production.

Nigel Havers, 62, is playing Algernon Moncrieff, who is meant to be in his late 20s, as is his friend John Worthing, played by 72-year-old Martin Jarvis. Lady Bracknell’s daughter, Gwendolen Fairfax, is played by 62-year-old Cherie Lunghi.

From left, Martin Jarvis, Cherie Lunghi, Nigel Havers and Sian Philips have a combined age of 276, despite this, the cast of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest are wowing audiences in the West End 

Yes, this version of the play — described by Wilde himself as ‘a trivial comedy for serious people’ — is a little different. It has an older cast than you would traditionally see in this comedy of manners. Much older.

The play is one of the most performed in British theatre. But few productions have divided critics like this one. The Mail’s Quentin Letts gave it five stars and said it made him fall in love with the play all over again.

In contrast, another critic found it ‘a third-rate production . . . performed by arthritic actors’. He seemed to take particular objection to Havers’s ‘preposterously abundant hair’.

Well-coiffed Nigel laughs when he thinks about how his hair has the power to offend. And then he shrugs: ‘But the whole thing was my idea, I’m afraid. I thought it was such a brilliant play that it could take doing something different with it. Not everyone agrees, but people hate change don’t they?’

Nigel fell in love with the play 32 years ago when he starred in a Peter Hall production as the charming rotter Algy — a part he feels was made for him — with Martin playing his friend, Jack. It starred Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell and was a huge success at the National Theatre.

Martin Jarvis and Nigel Havers play two friends who are ordinarily in their late 20s or early 30s 

Some of the backstage antics would have added to the acclaim — if the audiences had known about them. Havers suddenly appeared naked in the wings while Jarvis was on stage — causing him to explode with laughter.

Jarvis, in retaliation, put Havers’s dressing room clock forward, and persuaded the staff to panic him into believing he had missed his cue.

Havers and Jarvis have remained close friends and the show helped make both of them household names but they were never asked to work together again. So they decided to make it happen.

‘I saw Martin for breakfast and said: “You know how we always said we would do it again? Well let’s do it now,” recalls Nigel. ‘He said: “That’s ridiculous, we are far too old.” But then we talked about ways of making it work.

‘In my mind, these days if you are 60, it’s a bit like you were 30 a century ago. The way we age has changed. I thought that we could experiment with that and move the goal posts around.’

Martin came up with the idea of ‘framing’ the play within another. So the actors are also playing a group of amateur dramatic buffs called the Bunbury Players who are obsessed with the play. The performance of the show is depicted as their dress rehearsal.

Playwright Simon Brett was brought in to write the ‘play around the play’ and Nigel gave him some hints about what old actors who love performing The Importance Of Being Earnest are like.

‘At the National, after about a month in, I winked at the audience after the first act and it got a huge laugh,’ recalls Nigel. ‘In the interval there was a bang on my dressing room door and it was Peter Hall who said: “I was watching tonight and don’t you dare do that again.”

‘So I said, “I’m so sorry,” and said I wouldn’t. But I carried on doing it, of course. It seemed the right thing to do. So I told Simon and he put it into his bit of the play.’

Then they looked around to see who else would join them: they didn’t have to look far. Martin’s wife, Rosalind Ayres, was brought in to play Miss Prism while Nigel’s long-time collaborator Christine Kavanagh takes the part of the sweet and slightly mad Cecily.

For Gwendolen, Nigel immediately thought of Cherie Lunghi. The two were in the same class at the Arts Educational Theatre School in London, but had never worked together. She says: ‘Nigel and Martin explained their idea and I said, “I have a feeling it will be a terrific adventure” and it has been.

The popular Oscar Wilde play is currently being performed at the Howard Pinter theatre in London 

‘Nigel is young for his age anyway; he has a sense of mischief. If I fluff on stage, he gives me this look as if to say, “Whoops-a-daisy, went wrong there, didn’t you?” which is extremely off-putting.’ Nigel laughs and then winks.

She doesn’t think there is anything wrong with playing an innocent enjoying the first flush of love. ‘When I play Gwendolen, I instantly start to feel and act more girlishly. I’ve told Nigel I would like to do Romeo And Juliet next.’

She wouldn’t be the first older Juliet; Sian Phillips played her some years ago in Juliet And Her Romeo, which was based in an old people’s home.

Sian agreed to play Lady Bracknell earlier this year in Washington DC, believing she could get away with it in America because there the role is often taken by men.

‘Apart from me playing the mother of a girl of 20, the production I did in America was more traditional, but both times the audience reaction has been the same,’ she says. ‘They laugh in the same places and when you reach the big denouement they shriek. It’s not us; it’s the play.’

But there are downsides to being in a play written for people 30 or 40 years younger. ‘It’s very physically demanding,’ admits Martin. He looks at Havers for confirmation. ‘Yes, this is taking it out of me a bit,’ agrees Nigel.

‘And Martin said last night: “Blimey, I feel a bit knackered. Being a 72-year-old playing a 28-year-old is very tiring.” We have to take care of ourselves a bit more than we used to. Normally, I can go all day without breakfast or lunch. I have to have them now, though, because I need all the energy I can muster.’

And then he sits down.
