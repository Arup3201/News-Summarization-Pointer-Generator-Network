Emails from a secret listserv of two former Hillary Clinton aides angling to run her next presidential campaign were published online Friday, creating a yet another media headache for the 2016 frontrunner before she's even announced her candidacy.

Calling themselves the 'mafia,' the list is reportedly run by Democratic operatives Robby Mook and Marlon Marshall, both of whom worked on Clinton's 2008, as a way to stay in touch with former colleagues.

The colorful emails, released today by ABC News, reveal Mook calling on his friends to 'smite Republicans mafia-style' and Marshall encouraging them to 'punish those voters,' in addition to other unflattering statements.

Today ABC News released their colorful emails, sent to a private listserv, after a confidante of the Hillary Clinton alum backstabbed them in an effort to keep them from being chosen to manage Hillary Clinton's possible 2016 presidential campaign

Mook, 34, is a veteran of several high-level campaigns, including John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. In 2008 he managed several state-based operations for Clinton before she dropped out the Democratic primary before running New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's campaign. 

He's since worked as the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and last year he managed Clinton ally Terry McAullife's successful bid for governor of Virginia.

Marshall, on the other hand, when to work for Barack Obama in 2008 after Clinton suspended his campaign, a role he resumed in in 2012, when he served as deputy national field direction of the president's reelection efforts. 

He's also worked in the DCCC in the past and now serves as a special assistant to the president and principal deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement.

In addition to Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman Guy Cecil, Mook and Marshall are considered top candidates to oversee Clinton's 2016 operations, if she runs. 

The best buddies were betrayed  this week by one of their own friends eyeing a job with Clinton in an attempt to hinder the duo's chances of being hired for top jobs with the Democratic star.

According to ABC News, 'the person who provided the emails is, like the vast majority of those on the listserv, supportive of Hillary Clinton, but does not support the idea of Mook or Marshall holding leadership roles in a second presidential bid.' 

While none of the emails are especially damning, they certainly don't paint the two portray the two potential campaign managers in a positive light at times, either, and provide an unnecessary distraction from both their credentials and their candidate's.

As former John McCain adviser John Weaver said on twitter today: 'The infighting to be Hillary's 1st (& 2nd) campaign manager/leader will be more negative than GOP presidential nomination fight.'

Neither Mook nor Marshall responded to ABC News' request for comment. 

In announcing the creation of the so-called 'Mook Mafia' listserv in November 2009, an email that ABC News believes to have been written by Marshall mocks Hillary Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton.

'The Mafia has finally built a bridge to the 21st century,' Marshall fictitiously qoutes Clinton as saying. 'This is even more exciting than walking through the back of the Bellagio.'

In an email sent just a few months later in January of 2010, Marshall wrote: 'F U Republicans. Mafia till I die.'

The same email encourages the 'mafia' clan to get on a phone from home program and make calls for then-Massachusetts Senate candidate Martha Coakley, who was competing against Republican Scott Brown to fill the late Ted Kennedy's seat.

'If you have just a few minutes, hop on that activate and punish those voters!' Marshall wrote.

In 2011, when Marshall was moving to Chicago, Illinois, to take a new position, Mook announced a going away party for him and wrote, 'It's true: Marlon Marshall is leaving our fold. Today is the day the grownassman [sic] grows up and leaves for America's Second City. 

'I know this prodical [sic] son will return to the mafia manger soon enough to smite Republicans mafia-style,' he added.

'If you can't be here in person, join me in spirit by sending your words of love and encouragement to the Most High Grown Ass Reverend Marlon D as he embarks on his pilgrimage. Please believe and obey the beard.'

The most recent emails sent to the group, according to ABC, were last week on Election Day. One, written by Mook, includes a private comment from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

'TEAM! I was just at the DCCC last night for the GOTV [get-out-the-vote] rally, where we were in the middle of GOTV calisthenics when Nancy Pelosi walked in and said we looked like the Village People. Some things you can’t make up,' he said.

The same day Marshall wrote to all their friends on campaigns 'crushing it mafia style and 'busting their tails for all that is right in the world' to tell that their annual reunion would 'be held early next year, January or February, and likely in New York for a weekend.'

The location has led to increased speculation that Hillary Clinton, who lives in New York and would likely base her headquarters in the state, will formally announce her candidacy in the next two months.

Virginia Gov. McAullife, a former Democratic National Committee chairman who served as chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, told U.S. News and World Report on Thursday that he, too, believes Clinton will make an announcement soon, though the Clinton confidante professed ignorance on her intentions.

'She’s got to make that decision, and she’s got to spe, nd the next 60 days making that decision,' McAuliffe said.

'She’s going to make up her own mind,' he said, adding, 'I tell you, I hope she runs. 

The emails shining a light into the minds of Clinton's possible campaign hands came as alumni of the Clinton political operation, donors and friends descended on Little Rock, Arkansas, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Bill Clinton's presidential library.

The three-day gathering began today and features speeches from Hillary and Cheleaa Clinton tomorrow.

It will be followed by a New York meeting of some of Clinton's top donors at the behest of the Ready for Hilary Super PAC that has been organizing support for a Hillary 2016 campaign for the past year and a half, per a report from MSNBC.

Hillary Clinton herself has acknowledged that she is considering another presidential campaign and she will make her decision known sometime next year.

Democrats are becoming more and more anxious for her to go public sooner rather than later, however, so that other Democratic hopefuls can get a jump on fundraising if she does decide to bow out.

A handful of their Republican competitors have been quietly building up their campaign operations for months and could begin officially launching their campaigns any day now.
