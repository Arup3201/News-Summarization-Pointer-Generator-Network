A lucky surfer was spared his life this Christmas season after a deadly great white shark leapt out of the sea right next to him but didn't manage to take a bite.

Photographer Tom Kampas filmed the unidentified surfer at El Porto Beach at around 11 a.m. on December 21 but says he didn't even see the shark's acrobatic jump until he watched the footage at home. 

Surfer AND shark: A shark popped out of the ocean just feet behind a surfer in California earlier this month

In the video, a shark can be seen leaping from a wave behind a surfer who is unaware of the animal’s presence.

'All of a sudden that great white came up from out of the water behind the surfer like a Polaris missile,' said Kampas.

'It all happened so quickly and I don’t think that guy was even aware of it.'

Kampas shared the impressive video with the Shark Research Institute who said that the shark is just a baby but that it is indeed a great white shark.

KTLA reports that there have been several shark siting off South Bay beaches but that few of them were as exciting as the footage captured by Kampas.

According to National Geographic, of the 100-plus annual shark attacks worldwide, one-third to one-half is attributed to the great white sharks.

'They are streamlined, torpedo-shaped swimmers with powerful tails that can propel them through the water at speeds of up to 15 miles (24 kilometres) per hour. They can even leave the water completely, breaching like whales when attacking prey from underneath,' says National Geographic.

The baby great white certainly displayed its masterful swimming skills earlier this month.

There it is!: Can you spot the great white shark leaping out of the ocean like a torpedo?
