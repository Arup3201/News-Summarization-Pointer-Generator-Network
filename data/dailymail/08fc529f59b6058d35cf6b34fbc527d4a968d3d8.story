Liberal MP Wyatt Roy and comedian Josh Thomas have swapped insults in a Twitter stoush about children in detention centres.

Josh Thomas, star of ‘Please Like Me’, took offence to a tweet from Roy about the Liberal party’s treatment of asylum seekers.

The Federal Member for Longman had claimed, ‘1100 deaths at sea, 1400 children in detention. Our policies have saved lives – a fact lost on Labor members.’

The comedian, 27, instigated a fiery feud by quizzing the Liberal MP about the alleged sexual assault of children in Australia's detention centres.

‘Our government didn’t actually rape, kids did it?’ asked Thomas, accompanied by an article about the reported abuse.

Comedian Josh Thomas has found himself in the middle of another heated exchange with a politician, when he took Liberal MP Wyatt Roy to task on the issue of asylum seekers

The Twitter stoush escalated when Josh Thomas referred to allegations that children in detentions centres have been the subject of sexual abuse. Wyatt Roy retaliated with an insult that referred to the title of Thomas' ABC TV show, Please Like Me

Wyatt Roy is the Federal Member for Longman. He had posted a tweet saying the Australian government is now implementing policies that are saving asylum seekers' lives

There were 33 reported cases of sexual abuse involving children in detention centres between January 2013 and March 2014.

Allegations also emerged last month that guards at Nauru detention centre have been sexually assaulting refugees. 

The 27-year-old comedian began the argument by tweeting: ‘You’re being a twerp’, meaning a ‘silly, weak-minded, contemptible person’.

Thomas took the 24-year-old MP to task over the Liberal government’s policies, also asking about cuts to foreign aid and the deportation of gay refugees to Papua New Guinea 'where homosexuality is illegal'.

Josh Thomas' first tweet, igniting the feud, was the simple four word insult: 'You're being a twerp'

Roy and Thomas swapped barbs on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon about the Liberal party's policies 

The Federal member for Longman retaliated, lashing out at the ‘Please Like Me’ star.

‘No wonder you have to ask ppl to like you (sic),’ Wyatt Roy tweeted to Thomas.

‘Is this part of your routine? I wouldn’t open with that in any company.’

The Federal MP’s first tweet was accompanied by a YouTube video of Roy speaking in parliament, accusing the Labor party of being responsible for the death of 1100 asylum seekers at sea.

Thomas pushed the MP to answer questions about the current state of Australia's immigration.

‘If the goal of being cruel to asylum seekers is to deter people from getting on boats then why the secrecy?’ Thomas tweeted to Roy.

‘And why not be crueller? We are a great, rich nation. Kick them in the balls, film it and put it on YouTube.’

Josh Thomas ABC show Please Like Me was nominated for an International Emmy in the comedy category

Roy responded to Thomas, defending the changes the Liberal party have made to their policies.

‘What is kind about ppl drowning & kids in detention (sic)? We can now take more of the world’s vulnerable,’ Roy tweeted.

When Thomas then asked about the rape allegations, Roy lashed out at the comedian.

‘really? Is this where you are going with this conversation. No wonder you have to ask ppl to like you,’ Roy responded, referring to the name of Thomas’ ABC television program, Please Like Me.

Wyatt Roy became the youngest person to ever be elected to Australian parliament in 2010

The Liberal MP told Thomas there are ‘516 fewer children in detention compared to when we came into office,’ standing by his belief that Liberal policies are saving lives.

Josh Thomas continued the debate, discussing the actions of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison.

‘There are less (children in detention) because loads were sent back to danger. It’s not good having @ScottMorrisonMP as your legal guardian,' he tweeted.

Josh Thomas also took a swing at the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison

Earlier this month, Josh Thomas was involved in another heated exchange with a politician whilst appearing on ABC program Q&A.

He criticised north Queensland MP Bob Katter for his refusal to address homosexual issues as a politician.

'You say that it's (mental health issues amongst the gay community) not a priority but you talk about it quite a bit, and when you do talk about it you say awful things,' began Mr Thomas. 'All you need to do (is) say you say you know what, I've said some things in the past, it was a mistake,' said Mr Thomas, telling Mr Katter how to move forward in a more positive manner.

'(You need to say) I understand now, it's (Mr Katter's comments) hurting people's mental health, it's part of the problem, not part of the solution.

'I'm sorry, hooray for homosexuals, here's some glitter.'
