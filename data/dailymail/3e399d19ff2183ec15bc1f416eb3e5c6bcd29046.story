A housewife died cradling her one-month-old baby and three-year-old toddler in her arms after a private jet crashed into three houses in Maryland's Montgomery County on Monday morning.

Montgomery County Fire and Rescue spokesman Pete Piringer says the Embraer EMB-500/Phenom 100 twin-engine jet came down around 10.45 am and exploded in a fireball when it hit the quiet cul-de-sac.

Three people were aboard the jet when it crashed Monday into the home in Gaithersburg, a Washington, D.C., suburb. The two-story, wood-frame home was gutted by the impact of the crash and ensuing blaze.

'We have a lot of work to do, a lot of damage,' said Piringer. 'But we do have one plane confirmed down, into a house.' 

He says crews have the fire under control and are conducting a search and rescue operation to find anyone who was in the three homes.

'The fires are under control. We are still working on a lot of hot spots,' Piringer said to WTOP.Com  

Piringer said that those hurt in the plane crash were in such bad shape that they couldn't be transported for medical attention.

Deceased: Michael K. Rosenberg, who is a CEO of North Carolina company, Health Decisions was onboard the flight.

'No one was transported to a hospital. They were not able to survive the crash,' said Piringer to the Washington Post. 

The most badly affected home was the two-story, wooden frame one which was gutted by the impact of the crash and ensuing blaze. 

The first floor was nearly completely blown out and smoke drifted from a gaping hole in what was left of the collapsing roof. Two adjacent homes also had significant damage, with one of them clearly having caught fire, as well. 

The crash centered around 19733 Drop Forge Lane and Piringer said that the mother and her two children had not been found yet.

The crash happened less than 1 mile from the Montgomery County Airpark. 

A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman says the agency is sending an investigator to the scene. 

Crews had the fire under control within an hour and were searching for anyone who may have been in the homes.

Television news footage of the fiery scene showed one home nearly completely destroyed, with only a car left in the driveway. 

According to ABC7 News, Michael K. Rosenberg, who is a CEO of North Carolina company, Health Decisions was onboard the flight.

Furthermore the pilot was described as 'experienced'.

Witnesses told television news crews that they saw the airplane appear to struggle to maintain its altitude before going into a nosedive and crashing.

Witness Tracey Everett told NBC Washington that she saw the plane in difficulty before it came down.

'You could tell he was struggling with the sticks. He was trying to pull up; he would gain a little elevation and then drop again,' said Everett.

'His wings were wobbling back and forth, very unsteadily.'

Suddenly the aircraft began to roll and came down onto the row of houses.

'...I doubled around, got into the block just before some of the firetrucks got here, and just realized there was nothing I could do,' said Everett.

Immediate reaction: Crews have the fire under control and are conducting a search and rescue operation to find anyone in the homes and plane

Fred Pedreira, 67, who lives near the crash site, said he had just returned home from the grocery store and was parking his car when he saw the jet and immediately knew something was wrong.

'This guy, when I saw him, for a fast jet with the wheels down, I said, 'I think he's coming in too low,'' Pedreira told The Associated Press. 'Then he was 90 degrees — sideways — and then he went belly-up into the house and it was a ball of fire. It was terrible.

'I tell you, I got goosebumps when I saw it. I said, 'My God, those are people in that plane,' Pedreira said. 'I just hope nobody was in that home.'

The jet is registered to Sage Aviation in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

According to the NTSB, there have been 14 plane crashes at Gaitheresburg in 19 years.

Of these, two were deadly and in total, five people died in these crashes.

'We hear planes come through all the time,' said a neighbor named Byron Valencia to NBC Washington.

'...I was actually in the kitchen making formula for my son, and I heard it come through, and that one was significantly louder than the other ones. And at the same time it passed over the house, and I heard a thump.... And then I started hearing sirens.'

'The aircraft was on approach to Runway 14 at the airport when the accident occurred,' said FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac to WJLA.Com.
