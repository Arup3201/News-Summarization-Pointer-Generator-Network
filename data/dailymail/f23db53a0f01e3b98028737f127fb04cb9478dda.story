Brendan Rodgers believes Liverpool's team spirit will remain one of their biggest strengths as he insisted Mamadou Sakho's show of petulance was an isolated incident.

The France defender has not travelled to Basle for the Champions League game but Liverpool manager Rodgers has made it clear that the player remained on Merseyside because of thigh problem sustained in training, not for any disciplinary reasons.

Sakho stormed out of Anfield on Saturday after being omitted from the 18-man squad for the Merseyside derby but Rodgers has moved to draw a line under the issue, explaining that he has spoken to the defender and received an apology.

There have been significant changes at Anfield in recent months but Rodgers does not feel Liverpool's unity has been damaged by all the comings and goings and he maintains togetherness will be key if they are to get a stuttering campaign up-and-running.

'It's not something that we expect from our players,' said Rodgers. 'We have spoken, he knows the situation and he has apologised. We move on. He has been injured in a training session. He has felt something in his thigh, he has had a scan and it will be two to three weeks.

'This is a group that has based its success on being a team and its behaviour within the group. Whatever we have achieved has been down to the team. We are working hard to consistently win games.

'It will take a wee bit of time but it (the reaction of one player) is never something that affects that team. We are working consistently hard to win games. We have not made as good a start as we would have wanted but there is a number of reasons why.

'We are integrating new players to a new culture and we have had injuries to key players. We have a big vision and an idea where we are going. It has been a difficult start but our performance against Everton at the weekend saw the intensity start to return.'

Liverpool, who beat FC Ludogorets 2-1 in their opening Group D game, could take a significant step towards reaching the knockout stages if they were secure victory here tomorrow evening but the task is easier said than done.

Basle have an impressive record on home soil – they beat Chelsea here last season, for example – and in 2002, they knocked Liverpool out of the Champions League when drawing 3-3 in an extraordinary clash, having earlier held them to a 1-1 draw at Anfield.

'This is a football club that has won eight of the last 11 titles,' said Rodgers, who continues to be without Daniel Sturridge. 'They are the force of Swiss football. They produce very good players. They are used to winning.

'They play good football and when they come into this tournament, they come in with confidence. I watched them in the competition last season and they were very unfortunate not to qualify for the knockout phase. They have some very talented players. We know it is going to be a tough game.'

Those sentiments were echoed by Adam Lallana. The England midfielder is starting to find his feet after injury set him back six weeks – he damaged knee ligaments during the club's tour of the United States – and he feels the same is true of Liverpool as a collective.

'We are very aware of what Basle can do,' said Lallana. 'I remember watching them play Chelsea last year. We are aware of them but we are focusing on ourselves. We had a good performance at the weekend and we are going in the right direction.

'I feel more or less there (in terms of fitness) now. I needed a few games to get going. I knew it was going to be tough but I am just delighted to be back playing. Being involved in these competitions is what I have dreamt about as a kid and we have a great chance tomorrow night.'

Meanwhile, Basle head coach Paulo Sousa feels his side will need to be 'perfect' if they are to get back on track after their opening 5-1 hammering at the hands of Real Madrid. He does, though, feel the game in the Bernabeu was not as emphatic a loss as the result suggested.

'If we could achieve more or less the same statistics in the Bernabeu, with 50 per cent possession and 16 shots on goal, we have a great opportunity to win this game,' said Sousa. 

'We need to be at our best to beat a historic club like Liverpool. The fieldwork I have seen tells me we will create lots of difficulties for Rodgers team.'
