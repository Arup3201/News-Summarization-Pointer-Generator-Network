After his requests to meet Pope Francis were snubbed at the last minute, Russel Crowe, who was in Italy anyway, went to try and see him and was snubbed once more.

Before, he looked jovial waiting for the Pope to see if he could get a brief chat in before the Pope disappeared to see his VIP audience.

However, soon Crowe's mood turned sour as the movie star was approached by police at the general audience and told to leave, moments before the Pontiff decided to acknoledge many members of the general audience except for him.

The Pope's meeting with Crowe had been snubbed once before according to Paramount, as the Vatican declared the visit to the Pope's audience by the movie star would be 'too distracting'

Crowe was then ushered away by the police in Rome, told to leave the viewing area where the Pope intended to pass through shortly after

The
Noah star was previously thought to have a reserved place in the VIP section
 of the Pope's general audience so the leader of the Catholic church could give his approval to the £70million film.

But according to film company Paramount the Vatican cancelled, saying Crowe’s appearance would be too disruptive.

Not to be discouraged, Crowe queued up in the general area of the Pope's audience and waited for him to pass through the audience, hoping to have a chat.

However, his hopes were dashed when he was told to leave the audience, right before the Pope sped past, briefly stopping to accept a quick peck on the cheek from a young girl, before heading away.

Nonetheless, the actor was already in 
Rome for the film’s Italian premiere and decided to attend the pontiff's weekly
 address in any case.

Crowe took the unusual step of 
petitioning the Pope on Twitter, sending him at least 
five pleading messages, asking if he would watch the film.

A
 meeting was tentatively scheduled with Paramount vice chairman Rob Moore, 
director Darren Aronofsky and Crowe during today's general 
audience, Variety magazine claimed. 

However, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a meeting between the Pope and the Noah team was ‘never on the cards’.

Rather amusingly, the Pope's apparent

 arrived in the Italian city, Variety said.

Noah is thought to cost in the region of £75million and is due for release in America on March 29

Aronofsky's film, based around the story of Noah’s Ark from The Book Of
 Genesis, has already gained a fair amount of criticism.

Agnostic US TV host Bill Maher slammed the movie for a perceived lack of ‘plausibility.’

'But the thing that’s 
really disturbing about Noah isn’t the silly, it’s that it’s immoral,’ 
he said. 'It’s about a psychotic mass murderer who gets away with it, 
and his name is God.'

Noah
 is also thought to be banned in several countries for depicting 
religious characters, with censorship boards in Bahrain, Qatar and the 
United Arab Emirates informing distributor Paramount that they won’t be 
releasing the film.

Speaking of his latest 
role, the actor recently claimed his depiction of Noah will go against 
the grain of common belief regarding his character.

He
 said: ‘The funny thing with people, they consider Noah to be a 
benevolent figure because he looked after the animals: "Awww, Noah. Noah
 and the animals."

'It's like, are you kidding me.This is the dude that stood by and watched the entire population of the planet perish.

‘He's not benevolent. He's not even nice.

'At
 one point in the story his son says, "I thought you were chosen because
 you were good?" And he goes, "I was chosen because I can get the job 
done, mate".'
