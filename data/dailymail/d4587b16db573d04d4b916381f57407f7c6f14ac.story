These cheeky police officers were caught parking their van on a double yellow line as they made a 99-9 call to buy cooling ice creams.

The duo parked the large liveried vehicle at the side of the road in Oxford to take advantage of a ice-cream van serving 99s - ice creams with chocolate flakes.

While one cop waited in the Thames 
Valley Police van illegally parked on double yellow lines, his woman 
colleague, a brunette in heat-absorbing black uniform hopped out.

Illegal: Thames Valley police officers parked illegally on double Yellow lines in Oxford on South Parks Road

She returned soon after clutching two 99s, complete with sticks of the crumbliest, flakiest chocolate in the world.

Hopping back into the police van, the pair licked their loot before driving off from their illegal parking spot on South Parks Road.

However, the stunt has landed them in trouble.

Thames Valley 
Policeâ€™s Oxford local policing area commander, Superintendent Christian 
Bunt, said the officers faced disciplinary action.

Let me in the van: This officer was spotted attending to a 99-9 emergency for ice cream in Oxford

'This is not the conduct that we expect from our officers,' he said.

'Parking on double yellow lines for anything other than operational purposes is unacceptable.

'The matter has been addressed internally by myself as the local policing area commander and will be dealt with via our internal disciplinary process.'
