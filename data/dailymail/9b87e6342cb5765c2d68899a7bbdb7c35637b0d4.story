Hull boss Steve Bruce is keeping his fingers crossed that his players are ready for their big European adventure.

The Tigers launch their first ever Europa League campaign next Thursday evening when they face either Slovakian side Trencin or FK Vojvodina of Serbia in the third qualifying round, and it is likely to be Trencin who take a 4-0 lead into the second leg of their tie.

Bruce admits it is a challenge to be ready for competitive football in July, and he is hoping fitness level are up to scratch.
