A spectator has been killed during a horror crash at the infamous Nurburgring circuit in Germany after a British racing driver's car flipped over the safety barrier and into the crowd.

Driver Jann Mardenborough was cresting a hill in the northern part of the track when the car flipped upright, travelling 100ft before slamming into a barrier, sending it spinning into the air.

It cleared the 12ft wire mesh surrounding the circuit and landed in the crowd, fatally injuring one spectator, who has yet to be identified.

A spectator was tragically killed at the Nurburgring in Germany today after a British racing driver's car flipped over on the crest of a hill before plouging into a safety barrier 

The racing Nissan travelled 100ft with its nose pointing into the air before hitting a crash barrier, sending it flipping over the protective fencing and into the spectator area 

The Nurburgring is notorious for driver fatalities as most of its corners are blind and there is no run-off area, meaning most cars are only stopped when they crash into something

Following the crash the race was abandoned, and officials are now investigating what caused the car to flip 

Mardenborough is a 23-year-old who is currently competing in the  World Endurance Championship

The Nurburgring is well known for its fatal crashes, with track regulars estimating that anywhere between three and 12 people a year die on the 12.9 mile Nordschleife, or 'Northern Loop' section.

As of 2010 a total of 68 professional drivers had been recorded as killed on the track, with many more dying on popular open days during which members of the public are invited to drive the circuit.

A vast majority of the corners are blind, often involve hills, and have few run-off areas, meaning drivers are usually stopped only when they hit crash barriers.

Part of the track was used to hold Formula 1 races until 1976 when Niki Lauda was left in critical condition following a crash which saw his car burst into flames before being hit by two other drivers. 

The track also has several sections in which spectators are allowed close to the track. Despite this, accidents involving fans are rare, though exact figures are not widely available.

Jann Mardenborough was competing in the VLN1 event  when his Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 flipped up in the air as it crested a rise in the circuit.

A VLN statement read: 'The opening round of the VLN Endurance Championship at the Nurburgring was marred by an accident on Saturday which injured several spectators. 

While there are no official figures on deaths at the Nurburgring, track regulars estimate the between three and 12 people die there every year 

From the time the track opened until 2010, 68 racing drivers have died there during events. Part of the track was used for Formula 1 racing, until Nikki Lauda was nearly killed during a crash there in 1976 

'One of the spectators died, despite the immediate actions of the rescue crew in the medical centre at the circuit. The other injured spectators have been taken to hospital for ongoing medical care.

'The race was stopped to give emergency crew quick access to the circuit, and wasn't restarted.

'The accident occurred in the Flugplatz part of the circuit, with a competitor leaving the circuit for a yet unspecified reason and finishing up behind the safety fencing.

'The VLN and the organisers are deeply saddened by the accident, and their thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims.'

Mardenborough emerged from the car seemingly unscathed, although has since been taken to a local hospital for routine checks following an initial examination at the circuit medical centre.

A statement from Nissan read: 'Today's events have been a tragedy.

'We are all deeply shocked and saddened by these events and our immediate thoughts go to the deceased, those injured and their families and friends.

Following the crash, which left debris scattered throughout the viewing area, Mardenborough was taken to hospital for routine checks, but is believed to be unhurt

'The team is fully co-operating with the race organisers to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into this incident.'

Mardenborough is renowned for his epic rise into motor racing just four years after winning Nissan's 'gamer-to-racer' project.

In 2011, the 23-year-old from Cardiff won the GT Academy, a scheme run by Nissan and Sony that turns armchair gamers into professional racers. 

Over the past few years Mardenborough, son of former professional footballer Steve, who played for Wolves, Coventry, Cardiff and Darlington, has competed in sportscars and single-seaters.

In mid-February, Nissan confirmed Mardenborough would take part in a full season of the World Endurance Championship, which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

The Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 car has a top speed of around 200mph and can go from 0-60mph in under three seconds.

The Nurburgring was also the scene of three-time Formula One world champion Niki Lauda's crash during the 1976 German Grand Prix when his Ferrari burst into flames after hitting a barricade.
