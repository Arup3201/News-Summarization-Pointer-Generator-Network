Into orbit: Music legend Sarah Brightman had hoped to be a space tourist in 2015

Russia may shelve plans to send singer Sarah Brightman into orbit. 

It was announced last year that the 52-year-old soprano would go on a £30 million eight-day mission to the International Space Station.

But yesterday the head of the Russian Space Agency said the planned schedule may change, requiring cosmonauts to spend a month in orbit.

The longer stint would be unsuitable for tourists such as Lord Lloyd-Webber’s ex-wife, who has passed the necessary medical tests.

‘If it’s a monthly shift, then it will be staff cosmonauts performing short-term scientific research,’ said space chief Vladimir Popovkin.

Some officials had complained Brightman’s flight was a publicity stunt.

'It is very likely that the singer 
made an announcement about her possible trip to the International Space 
Station in order to advertise the release of her new album and to stir 
up interest in her world tour planned for next year,' the unnamed source
told Interfax news agency.

The source further claimed it was 
likely on the mission earmarked for Brightman's flight in October 2015 
all three seats would go to professional Russian cosmonauts.

Russian officials had also expressed earlier concerns over her condition by the time of the flight in 2015 or later.

'It is not clear how the upcoming 
three years, one of which the singer will spend in constant travelling 
around the world, will affect her health,' one was quoted as saying.

At the time her trip was announced, the Russian Space Agency had appeared enthusiastic about the planned mission.

The former wife of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber said at the Moscow press conference announcing her flight: 'This 
voyage is a product of a dream, 
my dream. Finally it can be a reality.

'I am more excited about this than
anything I have done in my life to date.'

She ha even raised the possibility she might 'sing a song from space'.

One test involved being put in a 
centrifuge replicating the gravitational force she will face on 
returning to Earth. She was also obliged to sit on ‘a rotating chair 
that makes you sick’.

With Nasa’s space shuttles now 
retired, Russian Soyuz spacecraft are the only vessels currently capable
of carrying people to the International Space Station.

As a result, 
open seats available for tourists have been scarce in recent years.

The most recent tourist on a Soyuz 
was Canadian Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, who paid around 
£21.8million for his trip in 2009.

Brightman, whose 1978 single I Lost 
My Heart To A Starship Trooper reached number six in the UK charts, said
seeing fuzzy TV images of the first ‘bouncing’ human steps on the moon 
in 1969 when she was eight years old inspired her to dream about 
travelling to space.

‘It was something miraculous. For me,
it was an epiphany,’ she said. ‘It seemed so unrealistic and crazy at 
the time but I suddenly saw that it was possible.’
