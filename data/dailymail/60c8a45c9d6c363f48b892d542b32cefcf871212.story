Russia has refused to take part in a public inquiry into the death of poisoned former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko.

The investigative committee of the Russian Federation (ICRF), a law-enforcement agency which answers directly to President Vladimir Putin, has told inquiry chairman Sir Robert Owen it will not be a 'core participant' in the process.

Mr Litvinenko, 43, died in November 2006 after he was poisoned with polonium-210 while drinking tea at a meeting, allegedly with two Russians - former KGB contacts Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun - at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square.

His family believes he was working for MI6 at the time and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin.

Former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun have been identified as the prime suspects in the killing, but both deny any involvement and remain in Russia.

Sir Robert formally opened the inquiry in July after Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina led a successful challenge against holding an inquest into his death.

In a letter read to a directions hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, the ICRF, sometimes dubbed the 'Russian FBI', said it would not take part as it did not agree with powers granted in public inquiries that allow evidence to be held in closed session.

The letter from solicitors Harbottle and Lewis on behalf of the authorities said: 'This is a decision that the ICRF has reached after very careful consideration and with much regret.

'However the ICRF is not willing to participate in a process where it appears that a considerable amount of evidence will be heard in closed session..'

They added the ICRF intended 'no disrespect' towards Sir Robert or the proceedings.

The inquiry will be authorised to examine claims of Russian responsibility for the incident which has been described as 'a miniature nuclear attack on the streets of London'. 

Mrs Litvinenko fought for the probe into her husband's murder after Sir Robert said he could not hold a 'fair and fearless' investigation as part of an inquest, and a public inquiry should take place instead. 

Marina Litvinenko tirelessly fought for the probe into her husband's murder, which resulted in the public inquiry being opened by Sir Robert Owen in July. The Government previously resisted launching an inquiry

The Government had previously resisted launching an inquiry, instead saying it would 'wait and see' what a judge-led inquest found, but the High Court ruled the Home Secretary should reconsider the decision.

Although Mrs Litvinenko and her lawyers will not be able to see secret material, the chairman can take it into account, unlike in an inquest. 

But it is unclear whether the right to broadcast the inquiry live will be granted by Sir Robert. 

Alex Bailin, QC, who represents eleven media organisations at the inquiry including the BBC, ITN and BSkyB, said broadcasting the inquiry would give the public 'faith' in the hearing.

'The media's only agenda is its sincere desire that the inquiry is as transparent and accessible as possible,' he said.

'The Secretary of State says there is no good reason for broadcasting any part of this inquiry, even the opening and closing submissions... also there is no good reason for broadcasting the evidence of witnesses.

'We say as a bald assertion that is untenable. There is worldwide interest in this case, a man was murdered on the streets of London by radioactive poisoning.'

Counsel for the inquiry, representatives from the Home Office, and the Met police oppose live coverage.

Richard Horwell, QC, for the Met police said: 'The public interest is best served by a public inquiry which encourages witnesses to come forwards which encourages witnesses to assist and which encourages and permits witnesses to give evidence without unnecessary pressure, alarm, intimidation or strain.

'It is the quality of the evidence which is paramount, not the broadcasting of it throughout the world.' 

Mrs Litvinenko attended today's proceedings which also touched the topic of special advocates for closed sessions.

Sir Robert will announce his decisions on broadcasting and special advocates at a future date.

The chairman said the substantive hearings would start on January 27 and an additional preparatory hearing would be held on October 16.

Sir Robert previously said that alleged Russian state responsibility in the 43-year-old's death was of 'central importance to my investigation'.

However, Britain's responsibility for protecting the former KGB officer will not be investigated as part of the inquiry as there is no evidence to suggest any failings on the state's part.
