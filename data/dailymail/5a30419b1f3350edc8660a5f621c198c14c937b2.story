A sophisticated spy who was accused of 
living the high life off the U.S. Government's dime with a bevy of mistresses, luxurious real estate holdings and a high profile social life has died at the age of 84.

Edwin P. Wilson, a former CIA operative who was branded a traitor and convicted of shipping arms to Libya but whose conviction was later overturned after he served 22 years in prison, passed away on September 10 in Seattle from complications from a heart 
valve replacement surgery.

Wilson spent his career at the agency setting up front companies abroad
 for the CIA and posing as a rich American businessman - which allowed him to socialize among the glitterati in addition to amassing real estate holdings across the U.S. and Europe in addition 
to a villa in Tripoli, Libya and houses in Lebanon and Mexico.

Traitor: Ex-CIA agent Edwin Wilson (center, leaving federal court on Jan. 22, 1983) was branded a traitor and convicted of shipping arms to Libya but the conviction was later overturned

The intelligence officer, who was married, flaunted his jet setting lifestyle and even entertained a mistress, who he dubbed his 'Wonder Woman,' gifting her with posh cadeaux like mink coats and fine jewelry.

His lifestyle came under scrutiny but he allegedly was able to stave off inquiries from the IRS by couching his earnings as a matter of national security.

But the good life came to an end when he was convicted in 
1983 for shipping 20 tons of C-4 plastic explosives to Libya in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and for other crimes, including attempted murder and criminal solicitation.

Clearing his name: After his release from prison in 2003, Edwin Wilson worked to prove his innocence

At trial, he said he did it to ingratiate himself with the Libyan government at the CIA's request.

Wilson was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the crimes.

A federal judge threw out his conviction
 in 2003, saying the government failed to correct information about 
Wilson's service to the CIA that it admitted internally was false.

He served 22 years in prison until he
 was released in 2004. He then moved to Edmonds, Washington, north of 
Seattle, to live with his brother.

While in prison, he sought to prove his innocence by using the Freedom of Information Act to request government documents.

Even after he was released, the man once described as a 'death merchant' and 'terrorist' worked to clear his name.

'I can't think of one thing I did that I have any guilt about,' Wilson told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in a 2006 interview.

'I didn't hurt anybody. I didn't get anyone killed.'

Wilson
 filed a civil lawsuit against seven former federal prosecutors and a 
former executive director of the CIA, but a judge in Houston dismissed 
the case in 2007.

Wilson was born May 3, 1928, to a 
farming family in Nampa, Idaho. He worked as a merchant seaman, and 
earned a psychology degree from the University of Portland in 1953.

He joined the Marines and fought in the last days of the Korean War, according to his death notice. He went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1955 after being discharged from the Marines.

After leaving the CIA in 1971, he made millions in the arms trade and bought a sprawling farm in a tony county of Northern Virginia, where he entertained generals, CIA officials and congressmen, according to a 2004 Washington Post article.

'I had a couple of villas that were very, very nice,' he told the Washington Post at the time. 'I had Pakistani houseboys and I had Libyans working for me, typing up proposals in Arabic.'

In 1982, he was lured out of hiding in Libya and brought to New York for arrest.

A federal court in Virginia convicted him of exporting firearms to Libya without permission and sentenced him to 10 years.

He was convicted in Texas in 1983, receiving a 17-year sentence for similar crimes.

A New York court sentenced him to 25 years, to run consecutively with the Texas and Virginia sentences, for attempted murder, criminal solicitation and other charges involving claims that Wilson conspired behind bars to have witnesses and prosecutors killed.
