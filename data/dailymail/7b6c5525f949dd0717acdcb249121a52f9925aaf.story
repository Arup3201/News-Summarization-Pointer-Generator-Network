A British holidaymaker died after swimming off a Dominican Republic beach in the early hours of Saturday morning, local media reports.

Sian Louise Marshall-Plewes reportedly drowned at 4am as she 'cavorted' with her 20-year-old lover Jose Manuel Cordero close to the popular Sosua Beach.

She became separated from her boyfriend after being hit by a 'strong wave', inhaled water and then passed out.

Civil Defence volunteers later discovered her dead body elsewhere on the beach.

Ms Marshall-Plewes had been staying at an apartment in Calle Llibre for one week and was due to fly back to the UK on Sunday.
