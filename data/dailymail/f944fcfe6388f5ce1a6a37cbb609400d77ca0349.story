Manchester City will offer Martin Demichelis a new deal to stay at the Etihad for another season.

Demichelis has established himself as a key defender despite a difficult start in England after moving from Atletico Madrid.

The Argentine is out of contract next summer but looks set to agree a 12-month extension.

Demichelis, 33, was restored to the City line-up in place of Eliaquim Mangala for Tuesday’s Champions League draw with Roma, but Manuel Pellegrini claims Mangala was not dropped for giving away two goals at Hull.

‘We bought Mangala for an important amount of money because we thought that we needed a centre back, but I’m very happy with the performance of Martin and Vincent Kompany also,’ he said.

Meanwhile, City’s game at CSKA Moscow on October 21 will be held behind closed doors after UEFA reinforced a supporter ban on the Russians.
