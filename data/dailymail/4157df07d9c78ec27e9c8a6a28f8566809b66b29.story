Jamie Carragher has hailed Arsenal's disciplined display during Sunday's 2-0 win against Manchester City.

Santi Cazorla scored one and set up the other for Olivier Giroud as the Gunners stunned the champions at the Etihad.

Arsene Wenger set Arsenal up to frustrate the home side, and the move paid dividends as the north Londoners returned to London with the three points.

And former Liverpool defender Carragher has praised the Frenchman for adapting his gung-ho approach.

He told Monday Night Football:  'I was shocked Arsene Wenger went with those tactics.They were more disciplined and a compact unit.

'They stopped David Silva and City's other creative players. There was nowhere  to go and no space to get into the pockets.

'Arsenal got men behind the ball. Aaron Ramsey was going out to engage and Cazorla stopped the ball going into attacking players. They sat deeper with [Francis] Coquelin behind the midfield.'
