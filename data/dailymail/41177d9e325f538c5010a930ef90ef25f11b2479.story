Sachin Tendulkar has revealed his ‘shock’ and ‘humiliation’ at being accused of ball tampering on the 2001 tour to South Africa and that he was so upset that he considered leaving the tour.

‘I had a very difficult time when referee Mike Denness alleged that I had been involved in ball tampering. I was shocked because I had always played cricket with integrity and honesty and would never do such a thing,’ he says in his autobiography, Playing It My Way, out on November 6.

The celebrated Indian batsman, who scored almost 16,000 Test runs in an international career which ran from 1989 until he retired at the end of last year, says that all he did was to use his thumb to clean off the grass that was stuck on the seam. He insists that he never tampered with the ball.

‘None of the umpires had lodged a formal complaint against me and it was humiliating to be labelled a cheat,’ he adds.

‘I wasn’t prepared to let it pass. I informed Mike Denness that I would complain about the allegation and would not keep quiet about it.

‘I was prepared to abandon the tour if need be but wasn’t ready to be labelled a cheat. It was about honour and there was no way I would allow a match referee to cast aspersions on my credibility.

‘Mike Denness’s decisions had led to a crisis that had ended up dividing the cricket world down the middle. It was an avoidable incident and one that left everyone bitter in the end.’

Mumbai-born Tendulkar, 41, also reveals that it was his great love of tennis, particularly watching John McEnroe, which got him started in sport, before a cricket bat replaced his racket and an incredible international career was born. He says he had even considered life as a tennis player.

He also claims that there may have been divine intervention in the 1986–87 season, when he scored his first hundred.

He was on 94 runs at the close of play and nervous about reaching his first ton the following day.

‘Sensing my anxiety, my father took me to a Ganapati temple in Bandra to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha and only then did I leave for Shivaji Park.

‘On my way I visited another Ganapati temple, the one I regularly visited before games. There was a water tap inside the temple premises and I regularly used to drink from it before I went to the ground.

‘I did the same that day and in the very first over hit two boundaries to reach my hundred.

‘It was a deeply satisfying moment.’
