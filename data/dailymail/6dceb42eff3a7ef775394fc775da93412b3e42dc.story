'Mother's worst nightmare': Daphne McKinley, whose racing driver son Sean Edwards died in a crash on the final corner of a test session in Australia

The British racing driver son of Formula 1 star Guy Edwards died in a crash on the final corner while giving a lesson on a track, his mother revealed today.

Daphne McKinley believes the car her son Sean Edwards was travelling in careered off the track because the throttle became jammed.

She also told how she begged him not to travel to Australia for the lesson.

Mr Edwards was a passenger in a Porsche when it hit a wall at Queensland Raceway in Willowbank, west of Brisbane, yesterday morning.

The 26-year-old starred in Rush as his 
father, Guy Edwards, who famously pulled Niki Lauda from the wreckage of
his burning Ferrari following the Austrian's crash at the Nurburgring 
in 1976.

Ms McKinley told The Evening 
Standard: 'It was just such a shock to have it happen in that way. I 
believe it was the last corner of the track and the session.

'I
said to him just a few days before "why are you going to Australia to 
do a lesson? You are winning the championship. You don’t need to go".

'It’s
a mother’s worst nightmare. It’s what you never want to happen, for 
your children to die before you. The loss to us is unfathomable.'

The
car shot across up to 100m of gravel, ploughed through two layers of 
tyres and hit a concrete wall before bursting into flames.

The
driver of the Porsche, a 20-year-old man from Brisbane, was pulled from
the burning wreckage and is in intensive care with life-threatening 
injuries.

In love: Mr Edwards with his girlfriend Laura Mitendorfer, whose Twitter posting suggested they may have been getting engaged

Lifelong passion: Mr Edwards started racing at a go-kart track in Battersea from the age of three

Rising star: Mr Edwards racing at Silverstone at the age of 17

Ms McKinley, who 
owns a property developers in Knightsbridge, said witnesses had seen the
brake lights working, which has led her to believe it was the throttle 
that became stuck.

There were no passenger controls on the vehicle.

Mr Edwards began learning his trade at the age of three at an indoor go-karting track in Battersea.

He
later threw all his energy into the sport after finding it hard to 
study due to his dyslexia and an attention deficit disorder.

He started his racing career back 
in 2003 in Formula Ford, going on to compete in Formula Renault UK, 
British GT, the FIA GT3 Championship - which he won in 2006 - before 
embarking on his Porsche Supercup career from 2008.

Sean Edwards died instantly in a crash during a private test this morning. He played his father, F1 driver Guy Edwards in Rush, and is pictured wearing his father's suit and helmet and next to his original car

Rescue: Local emergency services spent two hours extracting the driver - a 20-year-old man from Brisbane - from the burning wreckage, but Mr Edwards is thought to have died instantly  

Tragic: The incident occurred on Champions Way just after 11:30am local time

He is currently leading this 
year's Porsche Supercup standings, a series which supports Formula One 
at a number of grands prix, with a double header looming in Abu Dhabi 
next month to conclude the campaign.

His Twitter page suggests he became engaged in the summer - 
Laura posted a photo of a diamond ring on the social networking site 
next to the words: 'Thank you #diamonds #areagirls #bestfriend.'

Only a few days ago, she tweeted Mr Edwards asking if he missed being at home.

In
his last post on Twitter he said: 'Time to hit Queensland Raceway 
today, should be fun, hope there aren't too many kangaroos like at 
Bathurst!' - a reference to Australia's premier endurance auto racing 
event last weekend.

Earlier this month Mr Edwards wrote on his Twitter page next to this photo: 'Saw @rushthemovie last night, really great movie well done @RealRonHoward you did an amazing job. Dad says the same!'

Yesterday,
Inspector Dave Preston, from Queensland Police, said it had been a 
difficult operation to get Mr Edwards and the driver out of the smashed 
up super-car.

He told 
local media: 'The fire and rescue had to do extensive work in relation 
to extracting and opening the vehicle up sufficiently to remove him, he 
was trapped for some time.

'When I last went down there and he was being removed he [the driver] was awake and aware of what was going on around him.

British
former Formula One driver David Coulthard has expressed his condolences
over the crash on Twitter writing: 'Shocking news about Sean Edwards 
passing, top man and super talented racer, condolences to his nearest 
and dearest.'

Horror smash: The 26-year-old was in the passenger seat when the Porsche 966 crashed at Willowbank's Queensland Raceway, just west of Brisbane

Celebrations: Sean Edwards at the Porsche Supercup earlier this year

Success: Mr Edwards had enjoyed a successful season, featuring victories in the Nurburgring and Dubai 24 Hours

Three-times Le Mans 24 Hours winner Allan McNish said: 'I knew his father initially from his sponsorship days, so I have followed Sean's career a wee bit closer than you would normally do.

'The tragedy of it is he was leading 
the Supercup championship after such strong performances through the 
middle of the year. It looked like he was going to win.

'Also,
having won the Nurburgring 24 Hours this year (with Mercedes), I would 
say this was probably his strongest year in racing.'

The Motor Sports Association (MSA) said today it is 'shocked and saddened' by the death of Mr Edwards.

A statement said: 'Sean was a hugely promising young racer who came through the junior formulas in Britain, before making a career in international sportscar racing.

'He is leading the 2013 Porsche Supercup championship and had won both the N|rburgring and Dubai 24 Hours this year.

'The MSA extends its deepest sympathies to Sean's family, friends and fans at this difficult time.'

Hartmut Kristen, Head of Motorsport at Porsche, said news of the accident 'has sparked immense regret at Porsche.'

(Edwards) has for many years been one of the most popular and successful pilots in the Porsche one-make race series,' Ms Kristen said. '

Our thoughts are with his family and we want to express our deepest condolences to his relatives.'
