A Nigerian drug mule has died in a Spanish airport after cocaine bags inside his body split open - because airport staff refused to touch him fearing he had Ebola.

The man collapsed in the customs area of the Madrid-Barajas airport outside the capital after arriving on a flight from Istanbul.

Upon hearing that the man was from Nigeria, staff were too afraid to approach the man and left him in shivers on the airport floor.

The man, who had landed on a flight from Istanbul on October 18, died 90 minutes later from a massive drugs overdose, Spain's El Mundo newspaper said.

It added: 'A civil guard officer initially positioned the man on his side and identified him from personal documents.

'When it was clear he was a Nigerian, no one dared touch him.

'Medical staff decided immediately that there was a risk that this could be a case of Ebola.'

The man was left shivering on the airport floor after the bags burst inside him and it took an hour before it could be established that the man was dying (stock image)

It later transpired that the man was suffering the effects of a cocaine overdose after several bags of the drug burst in his stomach.

A passenger accompanying the Nigerian later told police that he had flown from Madrid to Istanbul on October 14 and had not been to Nigeria for four years.

Ebola has killed 4,877 people in the past six weeks, almost all of whom were infected with the virus in West Africa.
