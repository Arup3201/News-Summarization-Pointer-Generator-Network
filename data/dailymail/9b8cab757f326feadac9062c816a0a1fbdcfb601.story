She's one of the world's biggest supermodels, known for her striking looks and her love of pulling silly faces. 

But if Cara Delevingne isn't careful she might have some competition on her hands, in the shape of her  14-year-old doppelganger Olivia Herdt.

The teen from Uruguay has accumulated a 7,500-strong following on Instagram thanks to the fact that she looks uncannily like Miss Delevingne.

In this picture Cara's face is on the left whilst Olivia's face is on the right, and it is clear to see the girl from Uruguay bears a striking resemblance to the model 

In fact, she seems to have the 22-year-old's facial movements down pat. Olivia regularly posts photographs of herself crossing her eyes, just like Cara.

And, in a picture in which her face has been Photoshopped with Cara's, their similarities are even more obvious.

The fan captioned the split of their faces: 'I wish cara could follow me or like my pic. If you think that i look a little like her pls tag her its really important for me because she is my idol. Thanks.'

Olivia's followers can see the resemblance too and they regularly post comments on her pictures remarking on her likeness to Cara.

One user said: 'OMG YOU ARE CARA, gorgeous tho,' while another posted, 'can't believe how much you look like cara, wow! so beautiful x'

Olivia even has bushy eyebrows - a look Cara has made particularly popular over the last couple of years. 

In many of her pictures Olivia pulls funny faces just like Cara, here the two look remarkably similar (Cara is on the left, Olivia on the right)

The supermodel is yet to comment on her 'twin' but Olivia, who seems to be a big fan of the model, regularly posts saying that she hopes she will notice her. 

Along with her strong brows, pale blue eyes and similar nose and face shape, Olivia has an uncanny ability to copy Cara's signature silly photo faces.

Cara loves to make her eyes pop, stick her tongue out or mug for the camera on social media.

Now her South American lookalike has mastered the exact expression and has filled her Instagram feed with a mixture of Cara pics and her own impression of the model's face.

Just like Cara Olivia has strong cheek bones and striking blue eyes 

But Cara is not the only one with a looky-likey fan. Taylor Swift posted a picture of a fan named Morgan Jensen to her Tumblr earlier this week commenting on how she looked just like her.

Taylor captioned the picture: 'Lol I thought that was me.' 

Morgan is a model and graphic designer from Flagstaff, Arizona,who regularly gets mistaken for the singer.

Something which she sometimes capitalises on, as she has been previously spotted pretending to be her outside her concerts. 

In fact, she once commanded a two-hour long queue of fans all of whom thought she was the Shake It Off singer. 

Morgan said of Taylor finding her picture: 'When I saw [Taylor] had re-blogged [shared] it I screamed and threw my phone and for the next six hours after that I was an ugly mess.

'Taylor is everything and the fact that she saw my face and thought it looked like hers - I died!'
