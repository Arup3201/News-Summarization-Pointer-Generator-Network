Clowning around in a harlequin costume, a young Bob Monkhouse casts a sideways glance, barely disturbing his brylcreemed hair.

This rare photo is just one in a collection of more than 100 unseen black and white pictures of TV stars from the 1950s heyday at the BBC which have emerged.

They were taken by photographer Kenneth Clayton who was employed by the corporation to photograph programmes because there was no facility to record them.

He kept his favourite snaps back and, after he died, his family found a whole box of pictures.

Personalities in the images also include comedian Tommy Trinder and actress-panellist Katie Boyle, and
others whose stars have faded.

They bring to life shows that have been long forgotten and plays and productions that were broadcast live.

And the equipment cameramen did use to film would have been expensive to operate, so no extra resources could be spared for archiving purposes.

One image - believed to be from the programme The Floor Is Yours from 1953 - shows a panel discussion between parish councillor Evelyn Gibbs, freelance broadcaster Sam Pollock and economist Ronald Brech.

The photographer’s son, Daniel Clayton, who is selling the photos, can’t identify all the personalities and would like help.

He said: 'In the early 50s, my father was employed by the BBC to go and take photographs of programmes and plays.

'The BBC had no way of recording them and this was the next best thing, so at least they had some record.

'My father would go and take pictures of the programmes being made and some from behind the scenes.

'After he died in 2000, we found a whole box of them and while there are some people we recognise, it would be great to find out who all the others are.

'I don’t think these have been seen and if the BBC has copies, they might well have thrown them out.'

He said: 'Whilst these are clearly of TV programmes from before my time, they are a fascinating slice of early and perhaps lost TV history.

'A lot of TV history was wiped so it could be that these photos are the only ones out there.'

The photos are expected to sell for several hundreds of pounds at the auction on Thursday.

A life in pictures: Kenneth Clayton

Kenneth Laurie Clayton was born in 1922 and was a well-known photographer based in London.

His
first job was as a messenger boy for Fox Photos, the famous press 
agency in Fleet Street for whom his brother, Bertram, worked.

He was called up to the RAF in 1940 - and in 1945 bought a 5X4 Speed Graphic for £90 from an American airman returning home.

Kenneth Clayton was commissioned by artist Margaret Lindsay Williams to take a series of images for the Royal family. He is seen above with Princess Anne and Prince Charles. He even held the little Princess's hand - a move which could have flouted royal protocol

It was always his proud boast that he was the first photographer in Fleet Street to have such a camera.

In 1945, he and his brother went into partnership and started Feature Press Photo Agency, covering press, commercial and all other aspects of photography.

The siblings won their 
contract with the BBC in the early 1950s to photograph live productions on a regular basis.

Following their success there, the Claytons took over Wedlake 
Studio, a turn-of-the-century studio in Forest Gate, where they 
were still taking pictures on 12 x 10 plate cameras and using magnesium 
powder for their flash guns.

One of Kenneth Clayton's proudest moments came when he was commissioned by artist Margaret Lindsay 
Williams to take a series of images which she could use as the basis for
her first official portrait of Elizabeth II.

It
is not known exactly when the session took place, but it is understood 
that Mr Clayton was one of the first members of the public allowed into 
Buckingham Palace during the official period of mourning for King George
VI, who died on February 6, 1952.
