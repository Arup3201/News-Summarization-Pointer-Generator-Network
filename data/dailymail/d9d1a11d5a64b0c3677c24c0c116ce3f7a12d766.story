The Miami Dolphins touched down at Gatwick airport on Friday ahead of Sunday's Wembley showdown against Oakland Raiders in the first of three games in the capital this season.

Having arrived in England, the Dolphins planned to practice on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, the Raiders arrived on Monday and have been getting over the jet lag by getting into their usual practice routine.

As if a flight across the Atlantic Ocean to play a regular-season game wasn't distracting enough, the Miami Dolphins don't even seem to know who will be their starting quarterback.

Miami coach Joe Philbin has been asked repeatedly if quarterback Ryan Tannehill will start the game, but he has been noncommittal. However, ask Tannehill himself and you'll at least you get an answer.

'I'm taking the first snap of the game and playing the game,' Tannehill said. 'I'm prepared to my fullest and go out and try to put this team in a position to win games. Nothing has changed in my preparation or how I'm approaching this game.' 

Although the two teams have been an ocean apart all week, the Miami quarterback controversy is not lost on the Raiders defence.

'I don't want to get into what the quarterback is doing.' Raiders cornerback Carlos Rogers said on Thursday. 'They say he's still the starting quarterback of that team, so obviously it's not a backup that they trust, and he's going to be out there.' 

Ryan Tannehill is preparing for the game as usual but it is unknown whether the quarterback will start for Miami Dolphins against Oakland Raiders

With everyone trying to pretend this is just a normal week of practice, perhaps the best plan of action for the Oakland Raiders is to embrace the abnormality of being in London, and hope something positive happens.

The Raiders opened the season with three straight losses, including a 16-9 setback against the New England Patriots last weekend. Their next chance for a win will come against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday at Wembley Stadium in the NFL's first of three regular-season games in the British capital. 

'It's crazy,' said Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, a rookie who has started all three games of his professional career. 'I texted my wife this morning and she was still on Tuesday. I was texting her goodnight and she said good morning. It was weird.

'As the days have gone, it's gotten progressively better. The faster I can get into the right time zone, which is here, the better it will feel.'

The Dolphins chose to delay their arrival until Friday, giving the Raiders more time to get acclimated to the time difference and get their sleep patterns in order. 

Miami are playing in London for the second time since the NFL started staging regular-season games in Britain, losing 13-10 to New York Giants back in 2007, while the Raiders are in England for the first time.

Both teams will have a bye week after Sunday's game. 

Carr admits the time difference is 'crazy' but is hopeful of getting into the right time zone before Sunday
