A ferocious drive by Jose Maria Gimenez set Atletico Madrid on their way to a 2-0 victory at Elche that moved them into second place in La Liga on Saturday.

Diego Simeone's side are better known for their aerial threat at set-plays but they showed versatility to work a short corner to centre back Gimenez on the edge of the area and he lashed into the net after 15 minutes.

It was a solid display from Atletico, whose La Liga match last weekend against Deportivo La Coruna was overshadowed by the death of a fan in apparently organised fighting near their Calderon stadium.

Leaders Real Madrid aim for a record-equaling 18th straight win in all competitions later on Saturday against Celta Vigo that would put them on 36 points from 14 games.
