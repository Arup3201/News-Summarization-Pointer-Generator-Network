A Fox & Friends host today offered a message following a sickening video of ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice punching his fiancée in an elevator: 'Take the stairs.'

The throwaway comment was made on Monday by host Brian Kilmeade following a brief discussion about the tape where the NFL running back was caught on surveillance camera knocking his partner unconscious.

Kilmeade quipped: 'I think the message is take the stairs.'

Playing for laughs: The throwaway comment was made on Monday afternoon by host Brian Kilmead

The remark led to giggles from his co-hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman before Doocy added: 'The message is when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera' before smoothly segueing into a new report. 

The presenter's remarks led to outrage online. News and politics editor at Global Grind, Christina Coleman, tweeted today: 'Why am I not surprised? This is how Fox News handled #RayRice video.'

Dan Murphy posted: 'If there's a more ghastly assemblage of callous mouthbreathers than Fox and Friends on TV I don't want to know.' 

Al Jazeera anchor Richelle Carey simply dubbed Kilmeade's remark as 'moronic'.

The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's $40 million contract on Monday in the wake of the release of the  tape showing Rice punch his then fiancée Janay Palmer unconscious in an Atlantic City elevator in February.

Minutes later, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice from the league indefinitely and said he would have to apply for reinstatement.

'I think the message is take the stairs': Journalist and stand-up comedian Brian Kilmeade made the remark on Monday's edition of Fox & Friends about ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice's brutal attack on his fiancée in an elevator 

The announcements follow hours of intense pressure on the Ravens and the NFL to give Rice a more appropriate punishment for brutally beating his now wife.

NFL officials had sparked shock and outrage in July when they handed him just a two-game suspension and a $500,000 fine.

On Monday, TMZ released previously unseen footage filmed by a security camera inside an elevator at the Revel Hotel and Casino, the video showed the couple – who married a month later – engaged in a heated exchange as they enter the lift.

Once inside Rice can clearly be seen to slap his girlfriend, before she hits him and the 5-foot, 8-inch, 220-pound athlete then punches her with such force that he knocks her off her feet. 

Janay then smashes her head on the elevator hand rail and falls unconscious to the floor. 

A Fox spokesperson told MailOnline today that Mr Kilmeade's remarks will be addressed on the show on Tuesday. 

In addition to his successful career in journalism at Fox, Kilmeade has been a stand-up comedian for ten years, according to his online bio. 

Ex Ravens player Ray Rice drew further criticism during a press conference with his wife in May, where she apologized, but he didn't say sorry to her for punching her in the face
