Jailed: Jack Craig Gray, from Shildon, County Durham, has been sentenced to seven years in prison after carrying out the brutal 'contract kicking'

A baby-faced teenager has been jailed for seven years after carrying out a brutal 'contract kicking' on a blind man over an alleged debt of just £80.

Jack Craig Gray, 18, was 'put up' to the beating by older companions, who promised to pay him £150, a court heard.

He attacked the vulnerable man in an alleyway - repeatedly punching and kicking him until he lost consciousness.

The 30-year-old victim, who is registered blind, was forced to undergo protracted facial surgery and is still receiving hospital treatment four months after the attack in Shildon, County Durham.

Gray and his unnamed victim, who did not know each other, had been at a mutual friend’s house on June 3, Durham Crown Court heard.

Christine Egerton, prosecuting, said the man had left the house after fearing he would be attacked over a debt of £80.

However, he was followed and cornered in an alleyway by Gray, who was joined by a second person.

'The defendant put his hands on his chest and mentioned the £80 he owed, before punching him around four times about the face with a clenched fist,' she said. 

'He fell forwards bleeding and was then repeatedly kicked, although the other person present may have also been involved.'

The victim, who later regained consciousness, managed to walk home and call an ambulance.

He suffered several fractures to his facial and nasal bones, as well numerous swellings and bruises.

Miss Egerton said: 'He was already registered blind due to poor vision in both eyes, but it was feared he may not recover sight in his right eye which is now much worse, although it is hoped his nose can be rebuilt.

Sentence: The 18-year-old, who admitted grievous bodily harm with intent at a previous hearing, was also ordered to pay a statutory surcharge of £150 at Durham Crown Court (pictured)

'He has now moved back in with his mother and is fearful being out on his own.

'He spoke of having done nothing at all to encourage this and was at a loss as to why the person attacked him.'

Gray, from Shildon, initially denied responsibility, but was picked him out at a video identity parade. The other assailant has not been identified.

John Turner, defending, said: 'Gray tells me he was directed by someone a lot older and more sophisticated to go and speak to this man about the debt.

'He accepted throwing three to four punches and a kick when he went to ground, but he then moved away and the other man may have then continued the assault.

'My client is almost being cast as an enforcer for a local gang. He denies that.

'He says he did this with the expectation he would receive payment. A figure of £150 was mentioned, but, as it happens, he received nothing.'

Sentencing Gray to seven years' detention in a young offenders’ institution, Recorder Ben Nolan said: 'This might be described as a "contract kicking" to enforce a debt.

'It matters not that others, older, may have been behind this.

'The fact is you took part in what was a serious plan to enforce this debt by violence, with grave consequences for the victim.'

Gray, who admitted grievous bodily harm with intent at a previous hearing, was ordered to pay a statutory surcharge of £150.
