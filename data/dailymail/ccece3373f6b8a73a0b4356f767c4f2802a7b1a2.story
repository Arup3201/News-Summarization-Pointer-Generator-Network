With their historic mansions and quaint tea shops - National Trust venues seem like the perfect family day out.

But the charity has its eye on a rather different audience - as it prepares to host burlesque nights in stately homes.

In a bid to attract younger visitors two racy performances featuring cocktails and scantily-clad dancers will be held, after last year saw a four per cent decline in visitors across the country.

The trust will seek to change perceptions to give off a less ‘buttoned-up’ impression to younger audiences.

To reassure members concerned about the trust sexing up its image, a spokesman said performances would be ‘tasteful’ with dancers ‘showing off their corsets, feathers and pearls’.

Organiser Shelley Barns told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It is a family event, so the burlesque dancers will be quite tame.

‘It is supposed to be a bit light-hearted. They won’t be getting completely naked, let’s put it that way. This is the ﬁrst time they have performed anywhere like this.’

Felicity Boucher, a visitor services ofﬁcer for the trust, said: ‘We’ve never tried anything like this before but with the backdrop of the house and garden it seemed like the perfect setting for an evening of cocktails and nostalgic appeal.’

The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes.

One of the reasons for the turn to burlesque nights is the fact that there was a four per cent decline in the number of visitors to National Trust properties across the country last year

Performers will include Kitty’s Dolls Burlesque and singer Lola Lamour, with adult tickets costing £18.50.

The second will be at at Trelissick Garden Cornwall, featuring The Slinky Minkys whose dancers include Babalicious, Miss Pip Tease and Miss Guilty Pleasure.

Last year it was reported the organisation - of which Prince Charles is president — was launching an X-rated digital guide to London’s red-light district.

It was a far cry from the Trust’s mantra ‘to preserve and protect historic places and spaces’.

Former Tory Prisons Minister Ann Widdecombe, said she was appalled by the charitable body’s attempt to update its image.

She said: ‘I fail to understand how getting young people to listen to these stories of Soho relates in any way to the important and historic work of the National Trust.’

‘In fact if this is the National Trust’s idea of attracting new members, I suggest they go for a brisk walk in the countryside to clear their brains and recover their senses.’

The National Trust events may raise an eyebrow among some traditional members who have previously also voiced concerns over the organisation’s so-called ‘Disneyfication’ drive.

This is where the organisation  has attempted to make its properties more appealing to younger visitors with innovations such as guides dressed in period costumes and interactive displays.
