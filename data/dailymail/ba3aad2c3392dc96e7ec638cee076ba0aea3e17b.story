'The never before offered full 39th floor is the most expensive rental property in Manhattan - and arguably the world,' says a press release from TOWN Fifth Avenue who rented the property.

The Wall Street Journal spoke with listing agents Therese Bateman and Andres Perea-Garzon of TOWN Fifth Avenue who said that the space which went on the market at the end of October was leased for full asking price and that the less expensive space was rented at close to the asking price.

Luxury: The rental has six bedrooms including a spacious Presidential Suite fit for a king 

Ms. Bateman said that the distinguished renter will have the space through the end of December.

The luxurious space is on the 39th floor of the hotel and is 4,786 square feet.

The ample suite has six bedrooms and six and 1/2 bathrooms including a Presidential Suite.

The guest unit rented is the Getty Suite which is a 1,015-square-foot apartment on the 10th floor that has a 920-square-foot terrace 'for an extended family-entourage situation,' said Ms. Bateman.

The guest will be spared no amenities and will have access to a chauffeur-driven Jaguar, a concierge service, and language specific butler.

'We’re delighted that our launching of this luxury portfolio has generated such an immediate response,' Bateman said in the press release. 

Perea-Garzon agreed, saying 'We have received strong interest from both the international and the domestic markets.'  

The MailOnline spoke with a resident at The Pierre who said that the more expensive rental belonged to a couple but that the husband of the woman who lived there passed away recently.

The previous tenant, whose name has not been revealed, is said to have moved to a smaller luxurious unit on the 24th floor.

The properties are part of The Pierre Hotel Residences portfolio of ten Grand Suites that were launched by TOWN Fifth Avenue on October 30, 2014 and range in price from $75,000 to $500,000 per month.

Which view is better?: The view of Manhattan from The Pierre is a special treat but a view of the apartment's interior is equally awe inspiring
