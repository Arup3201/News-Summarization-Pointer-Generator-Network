Lingering suspicion directed at the captain of missing flight MH370 has today lifted, as FBI investigators reveal they found 'nothing sinister' on his home-built flight simulator.

Officials in Kuala Lumpur declared that Malysian police and the FBI's technical experts have found nothing to suggest Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was planning to hijack the flight after closelyÂ  examining his flight simulator.

Police who raided the 53-year-old's house in a wealthy part of Kuala Lumpur seized the simulator, taking it apart piece by piece, to examine its hard drive for clues.

Suspicious: The captain of the missing airline MH370, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, has been dubbed the 'chief suspect' in Malaysia's official police investigation into the incident

The criminal inquiry cleared all the  intelligence checks completed for all the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur. The only individual arousing suspicion was Captian Shah

The probe revealed that logs had been deleted on February 3.

It meant records of what Captain Shah had been up to on the simulator prior to that date had been erased.

Experts who have anaylsed the programme, successfully extracting vital flight and technique records, are said to have found nothing to raise suspicion.

'As far as I know, there is nothing sinister on the simulator but of course that will have to be confirmed by the chief of police,' Mr Hussein Hishammuddin, Malaysia's Defence Minister and acting Minister of Transport, said in Kuala Lumpur today.

He made the dramatic revelation at a briefing after meeting relatives of the Boeing 777's passengers, most of whom were Chinese.

Until the revelation, suspicion had lingered over the pilot. Had he practiced landing on a remote airfield where he intended to take MH370? Had he tried sending a make-believe aircraft on a crazy joy ride, taking it up to 45,000ft and then putting it into a plunge?

Those were the questions that many were asking about his activities on the simulator, but the FBI has concluded he was up to nothing suspicious.

The lessening of the pilot's complicity in the fate of the aircraft is now expected to focus on the jet experiencing a major catastrophic event which forced Captain Zaharie and his 27-year-old co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid to turn it around from its Kuala Lumpur-Beijing route and head west to the nearest airfield.

However, some experts believe that smoke, depressurisation or some other disaster had rendered the pilots incapable of controlling the aircraft and auto-pilot had taken it out into the Indian Ocean.

Mr Hishammuddin said police would clarify the results of the examination of the simulator very soon, as investigations continue with international agencies into all aspects of the aircraft's disappearance.
