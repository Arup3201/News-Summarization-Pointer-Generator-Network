Anti-smoking campaigner Duncan Bannatyne was among those targetted for abuse online

Pro-tobacco activists have been accused of harassing and threatening to kill health experts and anti-smoking campaigners -  as the government considers banning branding on cigarette packets.

The number of online attacks and hate campaigns has risen sharply, since the coalition began consulting experts about plain containers.

Some websites have even called on followers to 'shoot' anti-smoking campaigners, listing businessman and Dragon's Den star Duncan Bannatyne among a list of targets.

Mr Bannatyne, a former smoker, was named in an blog in March, alongside staff of Action and Smoking and Health (ASH) and Cancer Research UK.

The article on freedom-2-choose.blogspot.co.uk also revealed the address of Ash's offices in London, Cardiff and Edinburgh, prompting staff to contact the police.It

It said: 'Snipers could soon snuff out 
prohibitionists ... It is time the humble smoker fought back against 
this intolerable persecution, for persecution is exactly what it is.'

The website - which isn't connected to the campaign group Freedom2Choose - has since removed the article, claiming it was intended to be satirical.

But those in favour of harsher regulation on tobacco products say it's not an isolated incident.

Bath University has been forced to increase security for its tobacco control research group after staff began receiving threatening phone calls and emails.

Group director Anna Gilmore says she received seven calls a day for two months after publishing an article about the illegal trade in smokeless tobacco.

Conflict: The government is considering banning all branding on cigarette packets - angering smokers

Mrs Gilmore told The Guardian: 'The ones I answered were intimidatory; the tone was aggressive. Many of my team felt threatened and worried by this.'

'We've had abuse before, over the debate about banning smoking in public places, and I get some of this every time I publish a paper, but it's increasing...This is part of a deliberate attempt to misinform the public and politicians, denigrate our research and to harass, denigrate and undermine us as researchers.'

When Stirling University's Linda Bauld published the paper that led to the Government consultation on plain packaging - she was bombarded with abuse.

A pro-smoking blogger calling himself Frank Davis told her: 'You should start worrying when bricks start getting thrown through your window or messages daubed on your door.'

He added that she should emigrate so she would be elsewhere 'when your old university department gets torched and your old colleagues are strung up from lamp-posts.'

And said of Ash director Deborah Arnott: 'I'd have had a hard time preventing 
myself from strangling Arnott on the spot and on camera, or bludgeoning 
her to death with a microphone stand.'

Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams, chair of Westminster's all party parliamentary group on smoking and health, has also been subjected to online abuse since he spoke out in favour of plain cigarette packs.

Simon Clark, director of Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking (Forest), has distanced the group from the online abuse.

He said smokers had felt disenfranchised since the UK-wide ban on smoking in public places, but condemned the threats of violence.
