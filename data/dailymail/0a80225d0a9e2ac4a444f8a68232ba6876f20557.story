An auction into Marussia's remaining assets has been cancelled with the team understood to be involved in advanced talks with a potential buyer.

Birmingham-based GA European Valuations (GAEV) conducted one auction in mid-December when minor items such as steering wheels, manufacturing and office equipment and drivers' race suits were sold.

That followed the team falling into administration in October with debts of around £60million, resulting in them missing the final three grands prix of last season.

Marussia driver Max Chilton looks on from a Silverstone test last season, with the team now subject to last-minute takeover talks which could see them line up on the 2015 F1 grid

However, work has been ongoing behind the scenes in a bid to get the team on the grid for this season, albeit with a deadline of Wednesday fast approaching.

That is when GAEV was scheduled to sell off last season's race cars, along with all components, spares and race-day equipment, along with the team's cars that took part in the GP3 series.

That would have signalled the end of the team - provisionally listed under their old name of Manor on the FIA's entry list for 2015 - as a going concern.

Marussia missed the last three races of the season after going into administration, with Chilton driving down the pitlane in Sochi during their last appearance at the Russian Grand Prix in October

The Russian Grand Prix featured just Chilton driving for Marussia, with his team-mate Jules Bianchi left in hospital having suffered a serious accident at the previous race in Japan

GAEV has now confirmed that auction is to no longer take place, with no new date rescheduled, and with a spokesperson refusing to confirm a reason as to why the auction has been cancelled.

It is understood sporting director Graeme Lowdon and team principal John Booth are conducting last-ditch negotiations to save Manor.

One of the few positives is that 40million US dollars (£26million) in prize money awaits should the team compete again after its 10th-place finish in the 2014 constructors' championship.
