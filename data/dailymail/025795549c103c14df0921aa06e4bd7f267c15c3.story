Two parents forced to rent out their home while their nine-year-old son underwent a kidney transplant have been left living in a caravan after their tenant refused to move out.

Luis Goncalves, nine, had life-saving surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital after his father Ed, 45, donated his organ.

The family rented out their £150,000 home in Gosport, Hampshire, and moved to Tottenham, north London, while the boy underwent treatment.

Life saver: Luis' father Ed, 45, donated a kidney to his son who underwent surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital

Home: The Goncalves' property in Gosport, Hampshire, which their tenant has so far refused to leave

But now the family have moved out of London and have been unable to get their terraced home back.

Tenant Dawn Clark, 33, who lives in the property with her three children, owes £2,919 in rent on the two-bedroom home and has defied an order to leave.

She was supposed to move out of the property earlier this month but has stayed put.

The father
and son, Luis' twin brother Joe and their mother Siobhan have been forced to live in a 
caravan as they fight a court bid to evict Ms Clark.

Surgeons at Great Ormond Street are 
concerned Luis - who's suffering some kidney rejection after his operation - is not back home.

The family spent four months living in Tottenham and three months in hospital accommodation before they were forced to move to the caravan park in Selsey, Hampshire.

Twins Luis and Joe are 'devastated' 
that they can't go home, Mr Goncalves said. Joe has written a passionate
begging letter to the tenants in his home.

It
reads: 'Please let Luis go home. He has spent a long time in the 
hospital. It's no fun having lots of needles. I've been worried about 
Dad and that he might get hurt.

'I want us to play with our friends. I want us to play in our garden with our guinea pig. It's our house, it's where we belong.'

Mr
Goncalves said: 'Luis is shocked and really quite angry, he's upset, 
and his brother Joe, is a very sensitive soul, he's a very caring boy.

'Joe's tried very hard to look after me after my operation, he was helping me carry things and open doors.

'The last year has been a nightmare for him, watching what his brother has been through.

'The whole thing about finally being able to nail this and going home has been as big for him as it has his brother.'

Mr Goncalves is a communications director at an environmental charity while his wife is a full-time carer for their son.

In January an order was issued against Ms Clark and a man called Michael Yates.

Mr Goncalves took the matter to court and won a possession order last month.

Ms
Clark and her partner paid a deposit and two weeks rent upfront when 
they started renting the property last November. Mr Goncalves said this 
is the only money they ever saw from them.

Home: The family were renting a property in Tottenham, north London, but have now moved back to the south coast and have been forced to stay in this caravan

Mr Clark and Mr Yates are £2,919 behind on the rent which is £800 per month and the bill is increasing by £26.30 per day.

Mr Yates is the father of Ms Clark's three children and no longer lives at the property. However, he is named on the tenancy agreement so is liable to pay the outstanding rent.

Mr Yates said: 'It's an all-round bad situation for everybody. We're doing what we can.'

'Obviously I want the family to get housed as well but financially it's just not easy.'

Ms Clark refused to comment.
