Looking unhappily dishevelled in the rain as he dutifully watched a border collie demonstrating its skill rounding up chickens, Prince Charles’s thoughts are bound to have strayed — if only for a moment — to the sanctuary of the white cottage where he and Camilla have been staying all this week on their annual summer trip to Wales.

Imagine his pleasure as the royal rump sank thankfully that evening into the deep cushioning of the stripy sofas.

From there he could admire the Welsh weavings on the walls while dinner was being set under the vaulted ceiling of the dining hall with its medieval-style wrought-iron chandeliers and stone fireplace that even features his own heraldic badge above it — the Prince of Wales’s feathers.

The 100-year-old cottage is Charles’s royal bolt-hole nestling close to the Black Mountains in the Carmarthenshire village of Myddfai, and is called Llwynywermod House.

One who knew the 192-acre estate with its three cottages before the Duchy of Cornwall bought it in 2006, remembers its ‘tasteless’ salmon pink walls and brown velour sofas.

So different now, with its colour scheme of duck-egg blue — Camilla’s choice, it has been murmured.

Well, not quite. Like the Duchy of Cornwall’s 21 holiday-let cottages in the Scilly Isles, Cornwall and Wales, this one (which cannot be rented, incidentally) is the work of the only interior designer on whom the Duchy ever calls, Camilla’s younger sister Annabel Elliot.

Until the former Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles married the Prince of Wales at Windsor in 2005, the Duchy’s commissions to her little sister were... zero.

Together at last: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall finally married in 2005

Soon after Camilla became HRH the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchy decided to go into the holiday cottage-letting business, the first commissions were on their way to Annabel.

One long-time family friend spikily described the work put her way as ‘just a few crumbs from her big sister’s table’. But this week, amid renewed assorted cries of cronyism and nepotism, it emerged that the crumbs have grown into a loaf.

Indeed, in the past eight years, Annabel Elliot has received almost £1.2 million from the 700-year-old Duchy for ‘interior design services’.

In the past two years alone, ‘fees and commission’ have amounted to some £210,000 — not bad with the country going through lean times. Her earnings from this source remain a substantial part of the recent income of Annabel Elliot Ltd, which for some years has been run from a small industrial unit near Salisbury, Wiltshire, rented from the council for £350 a month.

Because it is classed as a small business it is not required to submit full profit-loss accounts. But publicly available figures show that, just before the Duchy work began, her company’s liabilities exceeded assets by £54,000. Figures for the last financial year show assets of £227,000.

Let us be clear about one thing: Annabel Elliot is known to be good at her work. She says she always tries to mirror the taste of her clients. That duck-egg blue in Charles’s Welsh cottage is the basis of the theme because it happens to be Camilla’s favourite colour.

But while Britain has many talented interior designers, Annabel is the only one mentioned in the accounts of the Duchy, which funds Charles’s multi-million pound lifestyle and last year paid him some £19 million. So why do no other interior designers get a look in?

The Duchy’s answer comes directly from the Prince’s spokesperson at Clarence House, and is crystal clear: ‘The Prince is very happy with Mrs Elliot’s work — she’s very experienced and does a good job. And as we have said many times before, the Duchy does not have to put the work out to tender because it is a private estate.’

Which is the sound of a door slamming shut on the hopes of others.

Could the reason be that he is indebted, in a way that he could never adequately repay, to his sister-in-law Annabel for her help during his most difficult years while he was still married to Diana.

The two sisters have always been incredibly close, as was obvious as they sat together the other day in the royal box at Wimbledon.

Theirs is the easy intimacy of sisters who know each other’s secrets. Certainly, there is practically nothing that Annabel — 18 months younger, and always seen as the prettier and brainier of the two — does not know about the tumultuous years of her sister’s infamous affair with Charles.

She was hostess, chauffeur, confidante — ‘the third person in the romance,’ was the wry observation of a close family friend.

Among their wider circle, however, it is generally accepted that, more than anyone else, Annabel found herself ‘sucked into the drama of her sister’s affair’ and, in many ways, found herself sharing the burden with her.

One family friend feels she ‘sometimes rather resented it as she had her own life to lead, but did it anyway as that’s what sisters are for’. Both sisters married within a year of each other — Annabel at 23 in 1972 to businessman Simon Elliot (her only ‘real’ boyfriend), son of an RAF Air Chief Marshal, Camilla at 25 (after a brief affair with Prince Charles) to dashing Guards officer Andrew Parker Bowles.

In those later, endless years when Camilla and Charles were secret lovers, it was Annabel and Simon’s country home, where they still live, in the Dorset village of Stourpaine that became the Prince and Mrs Parker Bowles’s favourite meeting place for discreet weekends.

Commissions: Annabel is the only interior designer that the Duchy of Cornwall uses and has been rewarded handsomely for her role

Thus Annabel was drawn into Camilla’s drama. She became the sister that Camilla simply couldn’t do without.

It was at Annabel’s own 40th birthday party, held in the Ham Common home of her friend Lady Annabel Goldsmith, that Princess Diana angrily confronted Camilla about her relationship with Charles.

Again, Annabel was at the wheel of the car in December 1992 that whisked Camilla away and out of public view as Prime Minister John Major was announcing in the House of Commons the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales.

Most significantly of all, Charles used the occasion of Annabel’s 50th birthday party at the Ritz Hotel in 1999 — just over a year after Diana’s death — to publicly formalise the relationship with Camilla that everyone knew about, by posing for pictures on the steps of the hotel.

After this, Camilla’s enduring gratitude is only natural. ‘She will do anything she can for Annabel,’ says one of their circle. ‘And Charles will do anything to keep Camilla happy.’

One way of keeping her happy was to ask Annabel and Simon to join them on their honeymoon at Balmoral. On their wedding night the staff set the honeymoon table for four. In fact, the Prince’s gratitude to Annabel is as considerable as Camilla’s. For all his many self-regarding faults, he never forgets people who do him a good turn.

For her part, Annabel, 64, while publicly discreet, can be rather grand in private. ‘She’s terribly prone to mention “my sister the Duchess” or “my royal sister”,’ reports one significant member of their circle. ‘It’s quite amusing.’

Not so amusing is the unease among royal courtiers. For the Duchy’s exclusive patronage of Camilla’s sister is yet another awkward and potential damaging issue on top of those already building up over Charles’s stewardship of the Duchy.

He has approved feasibility studies to build large housing estates on some of the country’s most cherished pastures despite intoning on television his familiar mantra about protecting the countryside.

And renewed efforts are being made by MPs to change the way he pays tax on his Duchy income.Ironically, all this has come about when the royals are going through their most popular and relaxed period for many years.

‘He could easily have ended the cronyism issue by asking other designers to submit ideas for the revamped cottages,’ says one close figure. ‘But he won’t. Yes, he’s grateful to Annabel, but he’s stubborn as well.’
