A father who stabbed his wife and two sons in their beds before starting a fire and embracing their bodies as he choked to death had been deeply affected by the loss of a baby four years earlier, an inquest heard today.

Richard Smith stabbed wife Clair in the chest and strangled her with a neck scarf. He then stabbed nine-year-old Ben and one-year-old Aaron at their home in Pudsey, Leeds, in December last year.

He placed their bodies on the marital bed, blocked the doors and windows and set fire to the mattress before lying down with them to die, Leeds Coroner’s Court heard.

Tragedy: Richard Smith (pictured) killed his wife Clair, also pictured here with 
Ben, nine, and Aaron, one, 
in December last year. An inquest heard how he had been deeply affected by the death of a baby four years ago 

Clair Smith, 36, was found cradling the ashes of baby Jake who died fours years earlier in December 2007 alongside her two sons, both wearing their pyjamas.

The inquest heard that she 
died from the stab wound to the chest and compression of the neck and 
Aaron died from a stab wound to the neck. Both were dead before the fire
started.

Ben had been stabbed three times, in 
the chest, neck and arm, but the wounds were not fatal. He died from 
inhaling smoke and fire gases and suffocation.

Scene: Mr Smith placed his family's bodies on the marital 
bed. He blocked the doors and windows and set fire to the mattress before 
lying down with them to die, Leeds Coroner’s Court heard

Investigation: A forensics officer prepares to enter the house in the aftermath of the tragedy

Dr Brian Rodgers, a pathologist who 
conducted post-mortem examinations on the family, said the suffocation 
could have been caused by a hand being placed over Ben’s nose and mouth 
or because his face was pressed tightly into his father’s chest as they 
lay on the bed.

Mr Smith, 37, a quantity estimator, 
died from smoke and fire gas inhalation but had also stabbed himself in 
the neck in an unsuccessful attempt to take his own life.

Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor, 
of West Yorkshire Police, told the inquest: 'Clair was in the position 
you would imagine was natural to sleep in, Ben was laid across his mum, 
Aaron between them and Richard embracing all three.'

Mr Taylor continued: 'Four years ago, 
almost to that day, they lost a baby Jake. The box containing baby 
Jake’s ashes was found in the crook of Clair’s arm.'

Mr Taylor said the couple would take days off work each year around the anniversary of Jake’s death.

Sealed off: Emergency workers in protective clothing prepare to enter 
the house. Officers initially thought the family might 
have died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning

Under watch: An officer guards the property in the aftermath of the grim discovery

Forensic teams are seen working at the house following the tragedy in December last year

Tributes: The bouquets were laid outside the house which was cordoned off with police tape. The note on flowers is from friends Sara and Dean Turnbull

Coroner David Hinchliff said: 'That’s something that obviously deeply affected them.'

Mr Hinchliff recorded verdicts of unlawful killing on Mrs Smith, Ben and Aaron and said Mr Smith took his own life.

The bodies were discovered at a property near the centre of Pudsey on the outskirts of Leeds

He said: 'It would appear Richard has 
undergone some aberration, some problem, affecting his mental health 
which caused him to take the action he has.'

Mr Hinchliff added: 'It was a concerted act of destruction of his family and his own self-destruction.'

He continued: 'It is my view that, 
having been the perpetrator of all that had happened and being faced 
with the enormity of whatever was preying on his mind at the time and 
causing an aberration of this immensity, he has taken his own life.'

The family were found at the three-bedroom detached house in Sheridan Way on the evening of Sunday December 11.

Speaking after the inquest, Detective Superintendent Taylor 
said they had attended a social event at a local cricket club two days 
previously, on the Friday evening.

He believed they died a short time later as Ben had not opened his advent calendar on the Saturday morning.

Detective Superintendent Taylor described Mr Smith as 'obsessive' and said he had been receiving treatment for depression for around two years.

He said something may have happened to cause Mr Smith's actions which would not necessarily have affected other people.

He added that the anniversary of baby Jake's death was also likely to have been a contributory factor.

Detective Superintendent Taylor praised the families of Mr and Mrs Smith for their dignity.

Ben was pictured in his local paper a few weeks before this death dressed up in a Pudsey Bear outift as part of a charity day at Greenside Primary School in Pudsey, West Yorks
