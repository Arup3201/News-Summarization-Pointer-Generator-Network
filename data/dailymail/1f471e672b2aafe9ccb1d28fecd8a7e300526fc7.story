The British woman gunned down by her gardener in Turkey had just ended their six-year affair.

After Anne Bury was shot dead by jilted lover Velli Acar  following her 56th birthday party, he handed himself in, shaking and reeking of alcohol, saying: ‘I’ve killed my wife, shot her mother and her son.’

Miss Bury’s only child Alex, 24, and mother Cecilia, 87, survived.

Yesterday, one of Acar’s friends told how he arrived at his house after the shooting on Monday,  begging to be taken to the police.

Businessman Ozay Akdogen, who has known Acar, 46, for 20 years, said he was besotted with Miss Bury, from Swainby, North Yorkshire, who worked as a risk manager for a Gulf oil company, but she had ended their relationship after he racked up debts of £100,000.

He said: ‘Velli was in a state of shock. He said, “I killed my love and now I am finished, take me to the police now.’”

Locals in the resort of Dalyan yesterday said Miss Bury and Acar had been together since she bought a plot of land to build her dream home there.

She would split her time between Dalyan and her job which regularly took her to the Gulf.

Faruk Ozlap, 57, a retired teacher, said: ‘About six years ago Anne came here and met Velli. They built her villa together, he helped her with it all and they started a relationship.

'He was a very poor guy from a poor village and she was his meal ticket.’

Neighbours said it was well-known that Acar had got into debt and had been forced to sell a boat Miss Bury had bought for him.

Mr Akdogen, who lives opposite Miss Bury’s villa, said: ‘Anne would come here three or four times a year and every time she would always be with Velli.

'They were in love, no doubt about it. When Anne used to work abroad in Dubai and Qatar, Velli would get me to write her little notes and text messages because his English was not so good.

'But they had problems in the relationship, she told him it was over and it was too much for him.’

Mr Ozlap said: ‘Velli had lost everything. The woman he loved, his home and his job. He had nothing left to lose and now he will never be released from prison.’

No doubt: Acar's best friend Ozay Akdogan (left) said the couple were definitely in love. Alex Bury (right) remains in hospital recovering from a gunshot wound

Wounded: Alex Bury, 23, was rushed to hospital following the incident. His grandmother also needed treatment

He said Miss Bury had phoned the police three days before the killing because Acar was ‘bothering her’.

Last night it emerged that Acar was previously married to another British woman, named locally as Ruth McGarry.

The relationship is believed to have ended when the gardener began seeing Miss Bury.

Miss McGarry, 59, from Malton, North Yorkshire, is understood to still be living in Turkey, but her family said she did not want to talk about what had happened.

Miss Bury’s son Alex, who works in medical research, remains in hospital after being shot in the leg. 

Her mother, who suffered minor wounds, is being comforted by her sons Jerome, 52, and John, 59, who flew out to Turkey from their homes in Stockton, near Middlesbrough.

One of the brothers yesterday denied that his sister was romantically linked to Acra, adding: ‘It’s completely untrue. That is not the case.’

Acar’s parents last night said that Miss Bury and their son ‘lived like man and wife’ despite not being married. They said Miss Bury’s family did not know of their relationship.
