Team news

Daniel Sturridge is still unavailable for selection, this time with a calf injury he sustained in training before he had returned to action from a previous thigh problem.

And given the woeful form of striker Mario Balotelli, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is under pressure to look at other options up front. Raheem Sterling could play in a more advanced role or Fabio Borini or Rickie Lambert could play.

Alberto Moreno should come back in for Jose Enrique at left back, but Mamadou Sakho is still missing from the squad through injury. 

Rodgers also has a decision to make over who starts at right back with Javier Manquillo pushing Glen Johnson for a starting spot.

For Real Madrid, both forward Gareth Bale and defender Sergio Ramos miss out for Carlo Ancelotti's team. Isco is expected to replace the Welshman in the Spaniard's forward line, while Rafael Varane should come in for Ramos.  

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Manquillo, Skrtel, Lovren, Johnson, Moreno, Gerrard, Can, Henderson, Lallana, Sterling, Balotelli, Markovic, Jones, Toure, Enrique, Rossiter, Coutinho, Lambert, Borini.

Liverpool have won all three meetings against Los Blancos, keeping three clean sheets in the process.

The Reds are the only team with a 100% win rate against Real Madrid in the Champions League.

Real Madrid have failed to find the net against just two sides in the Champions League: Arsenal and Liverpool.

In the only game between these two sides played in Liverpool, the Reds won 4-0: that was also the last clash between these two European giants.

Los Merengues have faced English opposition 30 times so far in Europe (W11, D9, L10).

Liverpool have met Spanish sides 32 times in Europe, winning 14 of those games (D10, L8).

Liverpool’s last home defeat in European competition came in October 2012 (2-3 v Udinese); Since then, they have registered three wins and a draw at Anfield.

Real Madrid have found the net in 40 of their last 41 European games (112 goals in total, 2.73 per game on average).

Real have lost only one of their last seven away games in Europe (W5 D1).

If Cristiano Ronaldo scores two goals against Liverpool, he will join Raul as the Champions League joint top-scorer on 71 goals.

Ronaldo has scored more goals away from home than at home in the Champions League so far (35 away, 32 home, two neutral).

Ronaldo failed to score in five visits to Anfield as a Manchester United player, but did score in his final two appearances against Liverpool (both at Old Trafford).

Mario Balotelli has been the victim of the most fouls won in this season’s Champions League, 12.
