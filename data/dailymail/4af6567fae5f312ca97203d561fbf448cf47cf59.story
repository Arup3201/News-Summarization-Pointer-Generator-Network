Real Madrid are hoping that a win against Levante on Sunday night will help them make peace with their fans, who have turned on the team after a recent poor run of form.

Carlo Ancelotti's men have come under fierce criticism after squandering their lead at the top of La Liga, with Marca's front page on Sunday referring to the situation as a 'pressure cooker'.

Levante are the visitors to the Bernabeu, in what AS have described as a 'trial run' for next week's El Clasico. The match at the Nou Camp on March 22 will go a long way to deciding this season's La Liga champions, and Ancelotti will be desperate to reclaim Madrid's spot at the top of the table.

The front page of Marca leads with the headline, 'Pressure Cooker' ahead of Real Madrid's game on Sunday

There will be changes in the starting line-up for the Levante clash, the Spanish papers claim, with Keylor Navas expected to get the nod ahead of Iker Casillas. The Spanish veteran made a number of high-profile mistakes against Schalke in the Champions League last week.

Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric are also expected to start, in order to get themselves ready for El Clasico.

Marca carry a quote from Madrid boss Ancelotti, who has stated that his team are 'hurt, but won't let our heads drop'. 

Barcelona continued their good form on Saturday, comfortably beating Eibar 2-0. The win means that they have extended their lead at the top to four points - and it is up to Madrid to close the gap with victory on Sunday.

In Italy, Juventus won 1-0 against Palermo, and are now gearing up for their Champions League game midweek

Mundo Deportivo's front page hails the 'solid leaders', who came through the game ahead of a decisive week against Manchester City and then Real Madrid.

They write that Lionel Messi was once again decisive, scoring both of his side's goals, one from the penalty spot and the other a 'great header'.

Messi has taken his tally to 32 league goals for the season, overtaking rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the process.

In Italy, much of the focus is on Juventus ahead of their Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund.

Massimiliano Allegri's side beat Palermo 1-0 to 'send a message to Borussia', who they beat 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 game a fortnight ago.

Elsewhere, Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini has labelled Yaya Toure his 'son', noting: 'With him, what an Inter!'

There has been much speculation over the Ivorian's future at Manchester City, and Mancini has been honest in admitting his interest in the midfielder.
