Infatuation: Sophia Loren and Cary Grant in The Pride And The Passion, the film they were making when Grant made his first attempt to woo the Italian star

Sophia Loren's memoirs will reveal in excruciating detail how Hollywood idol Cary Grant twice tried to convince her to become his lover.

For the 300-page Yesterday, Today And Tomorrow - My Life, the Italian screen legend, who turned 80 last month, has fished out old pictures, letters and notes detailing their encounters.

It includes details of how Grant suggested they should pray to make the right decision as he tried his utmost to seduce her while they worked together on a film set.

The pair became infatuated in 1956 when she was only 22 and already romantically linked to her future husband, the film producer Carlo Ponti.

Grant was 52 and on his third marriage, but he nevertheless asked the young star to marry him while they were filming The Pride And The Passion, a Napoleonic-era adventure romance based on a novel by CS Forester.

'Forgive me, dear girl,' reads one letter reproduced as a photograph in Loren's book. 'I press you too much. Pray - and so will I - until next week. Goodbye Sophia. Cary.'

Prayer was a word that appeared repeatedly in notes from Grant, who died in 1986.

Another reads: 'You'll be in my prayers. If you think and pray with me, for the same thing and purpose, all will be right and life will be good'.

Loren was born Sofia Scicolone in Rome on September 20, 1934, the daughter of a frustrated actress whose lover had refused to marry her.

She grew up in Pozzuoli, a poor town near Naples, and remembered begging for food from U.S. soldiers during World War Two. She was so thin her nickname was stuzzicadenti (toothpick).

Her mother took her to Rome, where she earned a small income for both of them by modelling for pulp magazines and winning prizes in beauty contests.

At one contest in the early 1950s she was spotted by Carlo Ponti, who secured her first roles. Although he was 22 years older than her, three years later he had left his wife and they were married - a union that lasted for five decades until Ponti's death in 2007.

'I had to make a choice': Loren with her husband Carlo Ponti, who she chose over Grant 

Loren said of her decision to stay with Ponti despite the attentions of Grant, then a Hollywood heavyweight: ‘You know, I had to make a choice, Carlo was Italian; he belonged to my world.

‘I know it was the right thing to do, for me.

‘At the time I didn’t have any regrets, I was in love with my husband. I was very affectionate with Cary, but I was 23 years old.

‘I couldn’t make up my mind to marry a giant from another country and leave Carlo. I didn’t feel like making the big step.’

In the interview with Vanity Fair Loren admitted she craved ‘a legitimate husband, children, a family like anybody else’.

Loren with Grant Washington, DC, in 1957: The rejctions didn't stop Grant taking another punt at the Italian

But the initial rejection didn't stop Grant making another punt at the Italian bombshell two years later, on the set of the romantic comedy Houseboat, set in Washington and based on an idea by Grant's wife Betsy Drake.

Drake had been expected to star in the film herself but her marriage with Grant was on the rocks, leading producers to replace her with Loren. Director Melville Shavelson later complained that the simmering sexual tension between Grant and Loren made the movie difficult to make.

The story seems to contradict persistent rumours since Grant's death that he was in fact gay.

Loren's book reads like a who's who of world cinema in the past 60 years as it chronicles the life of an illegitimate southern Italian street urchin who became one of the world's most glamorous film stars.

Its title comes from the 1963 three-part comedy anthology directed by cinema great Vittorio De Sica in which she played three different roles. The 'tomorrow' part appears to be her way of saying her career is not over. Her last film - an adaption of Jean Cocteau's The Human Voice - was released this year.

Each time Loren marks a major milestone it is almost a national event in Italy, in part a bittersweet reminder that the boom times she epitomised at the height of her fame are gone.

One television channel has been running only Loren films all week as a tribute to the woman who won two Oscars, first in 1961 for her tragic portrayal of a war-time mother in De Sica's neo-realistic classic 'La Ciociara' (Two Women).

Photo exhibitions and roundtables are being held about the extraordinary rise to planetary stardom of a poor teenager discovered by a film producer who later married her and made her what one critic called Italy's greatest export after pasta.

But, as the book shows, behind the mesmerising olive green eyes and silken cappuccino skin of her youth was a will of steel and an exceptional talent.

Such has been her unfading allure that one Roman Catholic cardinal quipped several years ago that while cloning was ethically wrong, an exception might be made for Loren.

In the book she describes her relations with several leading men aside from Grant, and reveals how she cut off an advance by Brando when they were filming 1967's 'A Countess from Hong Kong'.

'All of a sudden he put his hands on me. I turned in all tranquillity and blew his face, like a cat stroked the wrong way and said, 'Don't you ever dare to do that again. Never again!',' she writes. 'As I pulverised him with my eyes he seemed small, defenceless, almost a victim of his own notoriety. He never did it again but it was very difficult working with him after that.'

She also describes the 17 days she spent in jail in Italy in 1982 as part of a plea bargain over a failure to file an income tax return. At the time she blamed her accountant.

The book is published by Rizzoli in Italy and is due to be published in English in the United States in December by Atria Books, a division of Simon and Schuster.
