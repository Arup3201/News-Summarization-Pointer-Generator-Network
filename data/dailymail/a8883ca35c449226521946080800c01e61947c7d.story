At first glance it looks as if David Beckham might be stepping out of retirement with Arsenal - but Gunners fans can relax in the knowledge that Becks isn't their first summer signing; it's just Aaron Ramsey going through his pre season paces.

Arsenal's player of the year is back in training at London Colney sporting a style that Beckham would be proud of - given that it makes him look just like the former England captain with his slick haircut and designer stubble.

And Beckham - like Ramsey - has spent time on the training fields of Arsenal's base, both as an England player and when he needed to keep his fitness up during breaks in the MLS season while he was with LA Galaxy.

Just like Beckham, Ramsey is becoming one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and will hope he can push on this season if, like Arsenal, he gets a little bit luckier with injuries.

The FA Cup winners have a thread-bare squad putting in the hours at their North London base, with the likes of Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil still at the World Cup while Joel Campbell, Olivier Giroud and others are still enjoying an extended break after their tournament exertions.

But Ramsey still has some friends to hang around with - those that did not qualify, or were not selected for the World Cup are back at home with him, including Wojciech Szcezesny, Kieran Gibbs, Mikel Arteta and Yaya Sanogo.
