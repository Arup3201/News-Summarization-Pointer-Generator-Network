A 7ft young man struck with a rare illness which meant he never stopped growing has died of a massive heart attack despite his mother's desperate attempts to save his life.

Robert Smith was a prisoner in his home in the months before his death, bound the same condition thought to have afflicted Joseph Merrick, famously dubbed the Elephant Man in the late 19th century.

The 24-year-old was diagnosed with proteus syndrome, a rare illness which causes the abnormal growth of a person's bones, skin and head.

Robert passed away at his home in Walsoken, near Wisbech in Cambridgeshire despite his mother Rita's frantic attempts to save her only son.

Robert defied the medical odds 
stacked against him. His mother was warned he would not live 
beyond a month when he was born four weeks early.

Mrs Smith, 66, said: 'I can’t believe he has gone. Robert suffered a cardiac arrest and he just couldn’t breathe.

'I was on my own with him at the time - and I’m absolutely devastated. I don’t know what I’ll do without him.'

Robert, grew to weigh 19 stone, had size 16 feet and a 40-inch inside leg.

Standing at more than 7ft, he was one of the tallest men in the UK.

He suffered sight and hearing problems, and underwent a staggering 74 operations in his life time.

The 24-year-old also suffered gigantism, which meant he never stopped growing and also suffered hydrocephalus - a build-up of fluid on the brain - and epilepsy.

Three years ago he suffered meningitis, which left him unconscious for seven weeks and unable to walk.

In the three years since the illness struck, Robert had only ventured out of his home four times, at 19 stone he was too heavy for his mother to push in his wheelchair.

'Robert had not been able to walk since 
suffering from meningitis three years ago, when he was unconscious for 
seven weeks,' said Mrs Smith.

Robert, pictured at nine years old, suffered from proteus syndrome, which meant his bones never stopped growing. In the last months of his life he became a prisoner in his own home, having outgrown his wheelchair

Proteus syndrome, thought to affect only a few hundred people worldwide, results in bone overgrowth.

The word 'Proteus' comes from the name of the ancient Greek god of change.

This overgrowth is usually asymmetrical, so corresponding body parts are not affected in the same way.

Robert, for example, has 21 more bones in his hand than he should - and, as a result, suffers a great deal of pain.

More men are affected than women and the cause is unknown.

The syndrome became more widely known when it was determined that Joseph Merrick (the patient depicted in the play and film 'The Elephant Man') had severe Proteus syndrome rather than Neurofibromatosis, as had been suggested previously.

Last November friends and family launched a campaign to buy Robert a motorised wheelchair.

Within weeks more than £10,000 was donated by people from across the country, touched by the 24-year-old's plight.

Mrs Smith, her son’s main carer, said at the time: 'I am so grateful to the organisers of Robert Smith Fundraising.

'It has restored my faith in people.'

During
 the course of his operations, Robert had a titanium plate fitted in his
 head to make room for three shunts to drain the fluid accumulating on 
his brain.

He was born a 
month prematurely at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, 
Norfolk. It was immediately clear the newborn was seriously ill.

'Robert
 was born by Caesarean section and doctors said he would only live for a
 month,' said Mrs Smith.

He was being treated at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, for hydrocephalus when he started fitting.

Robert's mother Rita, 66, his main carer, said: 'I can¿t believe he has gone. I was on my own with him at the time - and I¿m absolutely devastated. I don¿t know what I¿ll do without him'

By the age of two the toddler had eight shunts draining fluid from his brain.

He had a titanium plate inserted into his head and was diagnosed with proteus syndrome at 16 years old.

At
 the time of his death Robert had been looking forward to his first trip
 out in his new motorised wheelchair, with his sister Marie Louise.

His mother, who suffers osteoporosis, arthritis, high cholesterol and a high blood pressure, said: 'Robert
 couldn’t wait to go to our local Asda store in Wisbech to buy DVDs and 
CDs and chocolate caramel sweets.

'It’s been tough but I wouldn’t change Robert for the world as he was such a gentle giant and very loving.'

The
 dedicated mother-of-two turned her living room into a bedroom for her 
son, and slept in the same room catching what sleep she could in a 
recliner chair.

Her only brief respite came when a carer sat with her son for three hours each week.

overgrowth. This overgrowth is usually asymmetrical, so corresponding body parts are not affected in the same way.

Robert, for example, had 21 more bones in his hand than he should - and, as a result, suffered a great deal of pain.
