Police have taken to social media to remind school students to think twice before playing a prank on their teachers, after one student was charged with assault.

A student, 14, at Melville high school, south of Perth was suspended, charged and given a juvenile caution after he put a laxative in a teacher's drink last month.

When alerted to the act, the school decided to report the situation to police and the teenager was then interviewed by Police.

'Putting a substance into someone's food or drink could result in dire consequences,' said senior sargeant Craig Collins

The Palmyra police took to twitter and said, 'if you're unhappy with your test marks don't put a laxative in your teachers drink #chargedwithassault #newsheriffintown'.

Senior Sergeant Craig Collins from WA police told Fairfax Media while some considered the incident as a 'joke' , offenders faced serious consequences.

'Putting a substance into someone's food or drink could result in dire consequences,' he said. 

Melville senior high school Principal Phillip White said the school took the incident very seriously and acknowledged what was thought to be a 'joke' was not humorous and could of had serious consequences.

'He's been suspended and given a written apology to the teacher,' he said.

'The student was genuinely apologetic and realised the seriousness of the incident, his letter was very eloquent and heartfelt.'

Principal White says the school does not condone this type of behaviour and said the student is 'very immature' and has learnt from his mistake.

'It's totally unacceptable and it hasn't been taken as a trivial incident,' he said.

'The teacher has dealt with this in a mature fashion and has been professional.'

'They have accepted the students apology and I am proud of the way they have reacted.'

Mr White says it's a learning experience for all students, that what they think may be a 'joke' can have consequences and is adamant the school will deal with any fallout.

'Kids make mistakes, we're teaching good behaviour. We are trying to move on'

'We will handle the consequences because as it gains more media attention there could be the potential of bullying for the student.'
