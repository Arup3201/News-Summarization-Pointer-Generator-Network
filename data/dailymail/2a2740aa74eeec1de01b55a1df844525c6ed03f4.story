Veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini has told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ after being told he will not face sexual assault charges.

The 65-year-old was arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree last October following allegations of sexual abuse.

After almost a year the Crown Prosecution Service yesterday confirmed that they will not be taking any further action against the openly gay DJ.

The radio DJ denied allegations of historic sexual offences when he was arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives last year 

But at the same time the CPS revealed for the first time that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15.

No mention of alleged paedophilia had been made public before. Gambaccini previously compared his situation to the deep injustice inflicted on impoverished black Americans in Alabama in the 1930s.

Last night after learning he could not face charges, he said: ‘Since I was falsely accused last year, the Scottsboro Boys have received posthumous pardons and I have been completely cleared. These are results.

The presenter joined the BBC in 1973 as a reporter for a music show. He is pictured with Noel Edmonds as he celebrates his last ever breakfast show with, from left to right, Peter Powell,  paedophile Jimmy Savile, Dave Lee Travis, Noel Edmonds, Simon Bates, David 'Kid' Jenson and Tony Blackburn 

‘There may be members of the Press who will ask me to give interviews or make provocative statements. I will politely decline.

‘To discuss horror in this way is to trivialise it. I will never trivialise the 12 months of trauma to which I have been unjustly subjected. I would like to thank my friends, my lawyers and the people of this country for their support during the past year.

‘Wherever I have gone, I have been stopped in the street by members of the public offering encouragement. I am very grateful. I’ll be back at work soon Thank you.’

The CPS said that it had already informed the complainants there would be no charges, but it would write to them in more detail, and would offer a meeting should they want the failure to charge discussed further.

The CPS statement has added fuel to controversy over the wide-ranging Operation Yewtree inquiry, launched in the wake of the late Jimmy Savile being unmasked as a prolific paedophile. Other celebrities including comedians Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck have had their names dragged through the mud after Yewtree investigated them over decades-old allegations.

In July, Stephen Fry blasted Yewtree for gaining convictions for less than half the suspects. Last night Conservative MP Nigel Evans – who resigned as House of Commons deputy speaker before being cleared of sex assault charges in court in April – called for suspects to be guaranteed anonymity unless charged.

Gambaccini’s solicitor Kate Goold complained that the US-born DJ, who lives in London, had fully cooperated throughout his ordeal but his bail was repeatedly extended with little explanation.

She added: ‘We are delighted with the outcome but deeply concerned at the length of time it took to resolve this investigation. Paul made his innocence clear at the outset and questions remain as to why this investigation took so long.’

Last night, the CPS insisted its mention of the age of the boys at the time of the alleged offences, and its public explanation of how it would discuss the lack of charges with them, were all ‘in accordance with guidelines’.

Dubbed the Professor of Pop for his encyclopedic knowledge of music, Paul Gambaccini had been a BBC radio DJ for 16 years when he was arrested last year. 

The 65-year-old, who is openly gay, was born in New York. 

He gained citizenship to the UK in 2005 despite starting with with the Corporation in 1973 as a reporter on John Steel's Radio 1 show, Rockspeak. 

He read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. 

Despite his success, Mr Gambaccini said he was victim to homophobic treatment within the BBC where his personnel file was reportedly marked with a Christmas tree as he was 'camp as Christmas'. 

He entered into a civil partnership with model Christopher Sherwood in 2012. 

Following an ITV documentary in 2012 which exposed the depraved paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, Gambaccini publicly condemned the Jim'll Fix It star, describing him as 'an enigma'. 

'He was not all good, he was not all bad, he was an enigma.,' he said on Daybreak. 

'You just didn't mess with Jim. 

'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops and you just let him have his turf. 

'And none of us were interested in going there.

'At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be. He had his own life,' he said on live television. 

He added he had been waiting for 30 years for the public to be made aware Savile's abuse. 

'I’ve been waiting for this to come out for 30 years, but then he did raise millions for charity.

'This comes out when he’s dead because he had an imperial personality in showbiz, and I’m not talking about personal life.'

'Once he was phoned and he said, "Well, you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville Hospital.

"Do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?" And they backed down.'
