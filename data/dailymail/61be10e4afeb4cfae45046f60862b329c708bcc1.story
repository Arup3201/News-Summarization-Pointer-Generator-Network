Erich Nowsch, the suspect in the 'road rage' slaying of mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, was high on marijuana while police questioned him following his arrest - and detectives knew it, his defense lawyers said today.

Nowsch, 19, had smoked pot before surrendering himself in the midst of a standoff with Las Vegas police, according to his attorney Augustus Claus.

Claus said he plans to argue in court that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial.

It's not clear what Nowsch told detectives after his arrest. 

 Erich Nowsch's defense lawyers claim that police knew the 19-year-old was high during questioning 

His attorney Augustus Claus claims that police 'watched' Nowsch smoke pot before he surrendered during a standoff with police (pictured) at his Las Vegas home 

 Claus said it could now be argued that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial

'People tend to say things that aren't entirely credible when they're under the influence,' he told the Associated Press.

Claus said 'not only' did the police let Nowsch smoke, they 'watched him do it' as they tried 'to talk him down' during a standoff that involved a helicopter and a SWAT team. 

The allegation was just the latest in a string of turns that has plagued what was initially thought to be a 'road rage' murder. 

Yesterday local resident Robert Selig said Meyers, 44, was killed in a 'drug deal gone bad'. 

'The son and mother left the Meyers residence looking for Eric on a drug deal gone bad,' he said. 'That's the word on the street. A prescription drug deal gone bad.' 

Selig said he believes Meyers went to the park to pick up pharmaceutical pills 'like Xanax' from Erich. 

'The kid sold it right there at that concrete table, day in day out,' he said. 

The Meyers family initially claimed that Meyers had gotten into an argument with Nowsch while giving her daughter a driving lesson on the night of the February 12 shooting. 

They said Nowsch followed them home and shot at them. 

It has since emerged that Meyers went home and recruited her son Brandon, who brought his handgun, to help her look for Nowsch after the late-night altercation.

Meyers was shot in the head and died after two days on life-support.

Claus said he believes Nowsch will be able to claim self-defense because Brandon Meyers was armed. 

Nowsch appeared in court in Las Vegas on Monday to be arraigned. His preliminary hearing was set for March 10.

Sitting on the public benches was Tammy's widower, Robert Meyers, who stared intently at Nowsch throughout the five-minute hearing. 

As he left court he told MailOnline: 'I'll be here every court date. You'll see me here at every hearing. 

'That's what Tammy would want.' 

Outside the hearing district attorney Steven B Wolfson told Daily Mail Online: 'There's been some speculation about drugs and drug use - but that's not the heart of the case. 

'The center focus of this case is the interaction between adults which occurred one night - that's the focus. Somebody lost their life and it was stupid.' 

Last week it was revealed that the Meyers family actually knew Nowsch. 

Daily Mail Online has learned Nowsch is believed to have been affiliated with a gang called Alpha Block. In a number of his Instagram pictures, he appears to be smoking marijuana

Nowsch told friends he had been involved in a shooting  and had fired 22 shots at a single location, according to a police report 

Mrs Meyers husband Robert, who claims police told him to keep his family's relationship with the suspect a secret, described how his wife had consoled Nowsch, would tell him to pull his pants up around the neighborhood and tried to teach him how to be a man. 

Mr Meyers told reporters outside his home on Thursday: 'We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before. He knew where I lived.'

'We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends.' 

It is rumored that Nowsch has been affiliated with a gang called Alpha Block. 

Nowsch posted a picture of him lighting up and taking a hit from a bong on Instagram

Local resident Colorado Wright, who knew both the Meyers' three sons as well as Nowsch, said the latter was known for being mixed up in drugs - including 'weed, meth probably, molly, ecstasy'. 

'He was always dealing drugs,' Wright said. 'He had a moped at one time and he would go up and down the streets in this neighborhood selling to everybody.' 

'He'd be walking down the street yelling out "I got weed" so loud and brazen about it'. 

'Most definitely he'd have been under the influence of drugs on the night of the shooting'. 

Last week it was revealed that the Meyers family actually knew Nowsch.  Mr Meyers told reporters outside his home on Thursday: 'We know this boy. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad' 

Meyers was taken off life support after she failed to recover from the injuries she sustained in the incident 

Daily Mail Online spoke to one person who has known Nowsch for a number of years – who asked not to be named – and he said three years ago Nowsch only had one tattoo and was always getting picked on by bigger kids.

The source explained: 'Baby G, everybody called him that because he was so small. He's 19 but looks 14. He had to take pills just to grow.

'Everyone kept on robbing him and robbing him. I think he got a gun because he was getting robbed.'

According to the Associated Press, police said Nowsch showed his friends a .45-caliber handgun after the shooting and bragged that he had 'got those kids' who were after him. 

Nowsch then claimed he fired several shots during the first altercation and 22 shots in the cul-de-sac where Meyers was killed, according to a police report. 

He has been charged with murder, attempted murder and discharge of a gun within a vehicle. 

Las Vegas police are still searching for a second suspect they believe was Nowsch's accomplice.   

February 13 - Las Vegas police reveal a mother-of-four is shot during an alleged road rage incident. She was later identified as Tammy Meyers. She was teaching her 15-year-old daughter Kristal to drive at the time.

February 15 - Her devastated husband, Robert Meyers, vows to find whoever did this to his wife. He turned off her life support after she failed to recover from her injuries sustained in the incident on Valentine's Day.

February 16 -  CCTV of the incident is released by police as they hunt for the alleged killer and his accomplice. Police also disclose a sketch of the suspect and say he is 6ft, mid 20s and 180lbs.

February 18 - Questions are raised over whether Nowsch acted in self-defense amid claims Mrs Meyers drove back to her home, dropped her daughter off, grabbed her son Brandon and hunted down the car in question. In response, Mr Meyers insists his son is a hero and not a vigilante.

February 19 - Following a tense stand-off with police Eric Nowsch is arrested. Mr Meyers claims he knew the suspect and said he knew the kid was bad. After the incident he claimed he wasn't aware who shot his wife. Added that his wife consoled the youngsters for hours and tried to teach him how to be a man.
