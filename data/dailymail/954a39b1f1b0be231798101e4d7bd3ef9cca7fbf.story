Police are hunting a thug who gunned down a pet cat in the street and left it with such severe injuries that its front leg had to be amputated.

The brute shot eight-year-old Toby with an air rifle from a range of up to 50 feet while he was hunting field mice in farmland near his home in Cheshire.

Despite his wounds, the whimpering moggie managed to limp back home and was later found covered with blood in his owner’s back garden.

Xrays revealed a pellet from the rifle had shattered a bone in Toby’s front left leg and, despite the intervention of a vet, the leg could not be saved and the animal had to have 14 stitches.

Today Toby’s owner Georgina Hoult, 26, of Mobberley, near Knutsford, Cheshire, said she was 'heartbroken for him.'

'Toby is such an active little thing and this is going to diminish what he’s able to do,' she said.

'It was just so shocking to see Toby like that.

'Everyone who has seen him has burst into tears.

'It’s such a tragedy he had to go through this and I’m angry that someone’s been so callous and cruel to do this to him.

Violence: Miss Hoult said that whoever shot her pet is 'callous and cruel'

'Whoever has done it can have no education about how to use that kind of weapon.

'Possibly they have done [this] for some kind of sick thrill.

'This person who did this is probably the type who play on video games and when they shoot things the targets get back up. They don’t realise that in real life it’s very different.'The incident is believed to have occurred on September 6 after Toby went out roaming in the neighbourhood.

He failed to return that evening and the truth emerged the following morning, when he was found hurt in Miss Hoult's garden.

At first she thought Toby had been hit by a car.

'I scooped him up and noticed his leg was really rigid,' she said.

'I rushed him to the vet and they found a big hole in the leg.

'The vet did everything he could but there was nothing he could do about Toby’s leg.

'He’s recovering at home now but is very groggy.

'He seems to be adapting to it well though. He’s wobbling around on his three legs.

'He’s a very good-natured thing, very happy and enjoying cuddles from everyone.'

But Miss Hoult said that every time she opens the door for the other cats Toby wobbles over and sits by the door mournfully because he cannot go out too.

'I think he was shot in a local field and he managed to hobble home. The injury is quite horrific. From the wound it looks like he was shot from about 50 feet away.

'He’s a big white fluffy thing. I can’t comprehend the mentality where someone would want to shoot a cat.'

Miss Hoult's mother Pauline Hoult, 59, a child care worker, said it is upsetting to watch Toby try to negotiate the stairs on his three remaining legs.

Games: The Hoults have put some of the blame for the incident on the growing popularity of violent video games amongst young people. The injury has badly affected Toby's mobility

'The worse thing is that we have spoken to a gun club who said that Toby was shot from 50 feet away so they would have known exactly what they were doing,' she said.

'I can’t think of anybody that could be this heartless. The law on air rifles is ridiculous.

'I never realised, but if they are misused then the law is the same as if you are using a real gun.

'However they are bringing the age down to be able to use them to 15 which is ridiculous. People don’t realise how dangerous they can be.'

Mrs Hoult placed some of the blame on the growing popularity of violent computer games among the young.

'The first thing you learn with guns is to never point it at anything living,' she said.

'They are all acting it out in their [computer] games but they have never seen the result of what guns can do.

'Toby is lucky that he managed to get home, otherwise he would have bled to death.

'These thugs don’t think of anybody else but themselves.'

Sgt Andy Miller of Cheshire Police said: 'We will not tolerate animal cruelty of any kind.

'We will be investigating this matter, and appeal to anyone with any information about the incident to come forward.'
