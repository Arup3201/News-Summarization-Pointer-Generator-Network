The victims of a horrific crash in Lodi, California, Tuesday evening have been identified as a father and his three children between the ages of 4 and 11, as well as a pregnant woman.

The multicar smash-up that happened just after 5.20pm at a busy intersection took the lives of Irving Miranda, 11; his 5-year-old brother Jose; their 4-year-old sister Stephanie, and the siblings' father, 30-year-old Luis Miranda.

Also killed in the crash was 31-year-old Vivian Rodriguez and her unborn baby.

Lodi Unified Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education Catherine Pennington told Lodi News said that Irving Miranda attended Lodi Middle School, where he distinguished himself as a good student and an all-around well-liked boy.

Stephanie was enrolled in a kindergarten program in Heritage Primary Elementary School, where her brother Jose was a first-grader.

The siblings and their father are survived by 9-year-old Eden Miranda.

Police say an SUV driver reportedly 
drove through the intersection of Ham and Vine streets while on his cell 
phone and caused a five-car collision, leaving up to a dozen people 
injured.  

A makeshift memorial had sprung up on the site of the crash, with sobbing relatives, friends and strangers leaving flowers, notes and stuffed animals in honor of the victims, News 10 reported.

Neighbors reported running from their
 homes after hearing the collision and seeing bodies - including those 
of children - in the road as emergency personnel arrived.

Five
 vehicles were involved in the crash, which eye-witnesses said was 
caused when a driver in an SUV raced through the intersection at speeds 
as high as 90mph while on his phone.

But authorities said they are still investigating whether cellphone use, alcohol or drugs were involved.

Several people were 
transported by air or ambulance to area hospitals, including St. 
Joseph’s Hospital in Stockton and UC Davis Medical Center.

Lodi Police Detective Eric Bradley told the Sentinel that three of the injured were in surgery late on Tuesday night but that their conditions were unknown.

Bradley added that the ages of those injured and the extent of their wounds was not yet known.

David Durand with the American 
Medical Response confirmed to the paper that
 there were children involved in the crash and that they had been ejected 
from a vehicle during impact.

Three vehicles were crushed together in the crash, and a pickup truck was bent so that it formed a 'V' 
around the hood of another truck, the Lodi News Sentinel reported.

Shattered glass and metal shards ripped from the vehicles had been strewn across the road and emergency responders put powder on the street to absorb oil, gasoline 
and blood.

Josh Ramos told News10 that he lives 
just doors from the crash site and said that when he walked to the street, he saw bodies everywhere and people in shock.

'People running around children outside crying people caring for them,' Ramos said.

Another eyewitness said she saw a little red shoe on the ground - which 'just broke my heart'.

A major accident investigation team is now analyzing the scene to determine where and how the crash occurred.

Lodi, a city of more than 60,000 people, is about 35 miles south of Sacramento.
