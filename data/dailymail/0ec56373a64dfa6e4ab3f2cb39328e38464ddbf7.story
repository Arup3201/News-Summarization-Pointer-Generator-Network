A pulsar moving at five million miles per hour has delivered the longest jet of high energy particles astronomers have ever seen.  

The jet trail stretches 37 light years, or 218 trillion miles long - ten times as long as the distance between our sun and its nearest star.

Pulsars are rotating neutron stars formed when the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life.

Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory has seen a fast-moving pulsar escaping from a supernova remnant while spewing out a record-breaking jet - the longest of any object in the Milky Way (seen here in the bottom right)

This pulsar, known as IGR J11014-6103, and its peculiar behaviour can likely be traced back to its birth in the collapse and subsequent explosion of a massive star.

The pulsar is located about 60 light-years away from the centre of the supernova remnant SNR MSH 11-61A in the constellation of Carina.

Spotted by Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory, its speed is between 2.5 million and 5 million mph, making it one of the fastest pulsars ever observed.

‘We've never seen an object that moves this fast and also produces a jet,’ said Lucia Pavan of the University of Geneva in Switzerland.

The jet here is seen with X-rays from Chandra. This pulsar - a spinning neutron star - is moving between 2.5 million and 5 million miles per hour

When the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the 
end of its life, protons and electrons are scrunched together,
 leaving behind a neutron star.

Neutron stars can fit roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city-sized 
sphere perhaps 12 miles across. Matter is packed so 
tightly that a sugar-cube-sized amount of material would weigh more than
 1 billion tonnes.

Most known neutron stars belong to a subclass known as pulsars. These relatively young objects rotate extremely rapidly, with some spinning faster than a kitchen blender. They beam radio waves in narrow cones, which periodically sweep across Earth.

‘By comparison, this jet is almost 10 times longer than the distance between the sun and our nearest star.’

As well as its impressive span, it has a distinct corkscrew pattern that suggests the pulsar is wobbling like a spinning top.

The pulsar's jet and the pulsar wind nebula are nearly perpendicular to one another, which is baffling scientists.

‘We can see this pulsar is moving directly away from the centre of the supernova remnant based on the shape and direction of the pulsar wind nebula,’ said co-author Pol Bordas, from the University of Tuebingen in Germany.

‘The question is, why is the jet pointing off in this other direction?’

Usually, the spin axis and jets of a pulsar point in the same direction as they are moving, but IGR J11014-6103's spin axis and direction of motion are almost at right angles.

‘With the pulsar moving one way and the jet going another, this gives us clues that exotic physics can occur when some stars collapse,’ said co-author Gerd Puehlhofer also of the University of Tuebingen.

One possibility requires an extremely fast rotation speed for the iron core of the star that exploded. A problem with this scenario is that such fast speeds are not commonly expected to be achievable.

The supernova remnant that gave birth to IGR J11014-6013 is elongated from top-right to bottom-left in the image roughly in line with the jet's direction.

The strange movements and huge jet could be explained if its parent star's iron core had an extremely fast rotation speed.

However, Nasa said that such fast speeds were not commonly thought to be achievable
