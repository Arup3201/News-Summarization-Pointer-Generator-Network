Tragic: Closer magazine editor Annabel Vered's (pictured) daughter Tess Burstein, 6, was killed at a Father¿s Day barbecue in the Hamptons when she ran out into the road

The daughter of a top magazine editor died in harrowing circumstances at a Father's Day barbecue in the Hamptons after she was hit by a car in front of her parents.

Tess Burstein, 6, whose mother is Closer magazine editor Annabel Vered, 43, was at a party for her investment banker father Josef Burstein when she ran in front of car in Water Mill trying to get to a friend.

The young girl was struck by the Toyota Prius driven by her 76-year-old neighbor and witnesses described the horrific wailing of her parents as they tried to save her on Sunday.

'I was in my back yard, and I heard the parents screaming, ‘No! No! Oh, my god! Oh, my God!’’ neighbor, Susan Infantino, 66, told The New York Post.

They were blood-curdling screams you 
know could only come from a parent. … I yelled over, ‘What happened What
 happened?’ And she said, ‘My daughter just got hit by a car!'

Tess's uncle, Amit Burstein said that his brother, Joef, 46, was completely devastated.

'She
 was an amazing girl, a very beautiful girl, very happy, very smart,’ 
Amit added of Tess. 'It’s a shock for everyone, a big, big loss.’

The family were hosting a barbecue at their summer getaway with other families when the accident happened.

The driver of the Prius, Maurice Wittenberg was driving towards the front yard of the Water Mill property with another car driving towards them.

Witnesses said this confused Tess, who didn't see the other car through her blind spot

'I think she waited until the larger car passed, not seeing the car coming in the opposite direction, and it hit her,’ Infantino said to The New York Post.

Treatment: Tessa was transported to Southampton Hospital and then to Stony Brook University Hospital where she was treated for critical injuries before her death just after 4pm

'I swerved left, but I couldn’t really avoid her. My car hit her, and she went flying and ended up in the middle of the road,’ said Wittenberg, a retired chemist to The New York Post.

'I feel it wasn’t my fault, but it’s still a terrible thing to know you’ve killed an innocent little child. It was the worst day of my life.'

His wife said that she wishes they had spent 10 more seconds in the supermarket - and this would never have happened.

A nurse rushed to help little Tess, but she died in hospital hours later.

Tess has a nine-year-old brother and a four-year-old sister who wanted to know if Wittenber was going to be given a ticket.

That sad question aside, there is no suggestion that Wittenberg was driving negligently or outside the law.
