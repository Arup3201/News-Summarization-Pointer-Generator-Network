A curious crab has been discovered off the coast of the UK that has mysteriously grown an extra pincer.

John Martin, skipper of Tizzard Lee-On, found the edible crab while fishing near Newquay in Cornwall and noticed the crustacean had three pincers on its right claw.

He has since donated it to the resort’s Blue Reef Aquarium where experts admit they don't know how or why the 7-inch crab developed the extra hook.

The edible crab, also known as the brown crab, is the largest species commonly found around the British Isles.

It has characteristic large black tipped claws and a ‘pie-crust’ edge to the shell which makes it easily identifiable.

Males can weigh up to three kilograms.

The
crabs are generally nocturnal, scavenging and foraging for food under 
the cover of darkness and adults are found as deep as 100m under water.

Tests have shown that edible crabs’ 
claws have the crushing strength of over 90lb per square inch - an 
average person’s hand is only capable of squashing 25lb per square inch.

If a crab loses a claw, they can re-grow it during a number of molts, which is when a crab sheds its exoskeleton for a new one, but it can grow back smaller or weaker than the original.

Jenni Smith from the aquarium said: 'It’s relatively unusual to come across crustaceans with extra claws.

'No-one really knows why this sometimes happens, it could be due to environmental factors or be a genetic mutation.

'Crabs, like other crustaceans, are capable of re-growing limbs and claws if they lose or damage them in a fight.

'Perhaps this particular crab’s ability to re-generate lost limbs has got confused and, rather than replacing a missing set of claws, it’s actually ended up growing an extra pair instead.'

Edible crabs also use their claws for fighting with other crabs, which often results in one or the other losing them.

If a crab loses a claw, they can regrow it during a number of molts, which is when a crab sheds its exoskeleton for a new one, but it can grow back smaller or weaker than the original.

A molt can last from between four and eight weeks, making the crab vulnerable to threats during this time.

Smith added: 'Although the extra claws look impressive they can’t actually function so he’s no more dangerous to handle than any other crab.'
