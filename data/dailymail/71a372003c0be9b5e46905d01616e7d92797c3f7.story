The House pushed through a $1.1 trillion bill financing the government through September after President Barack Obama phoned Democratic lawmakers and urged them to back the measure on Thursday.

The House approved the measure late Thursday by 219-206, hours before a midnight deadline to avoid a government shutdown. Although it must also pass the Senate and be signed into law, the White House has already agreed to support the bill.

After the measure passed in a narrow vote, House Speaker John Boehner said with relief: 'Thank you and Merry Christmas.'

President Barack Obama will sign the spending legislation offered up by House leadership if it passes Congress, the White House said today, in a blow to Democrats trying to bring the bill down

House Democrats had lined up on Thursday to blast the massive spending bill that keeps the government open through the end of the current fiscal year, with just hours left to prevent a shutdown. 

Liberals lambasted two provisions of the massive 1,600 page joint continuing resolution and omnibus bill - being referred to as the CRomnibus in Washington - that provided sweeteners for Wall Street and the wealthy and threatened to yank their support from final passage of the bill in a Thursday afternoon vote.  

Their last-minute push to block the legislation received a punch to the gut on Thursday afternoon when the White House came out in favor of the compromise package, but with just a few hours left to go, the president's team still hadn't wooed enough lawmakers, creating an opening for legislators unhappy with the final version of the bill.

Throughout the first part of Thursday Democrats took to the House floor to voice their displeasure with a section that would weaken restrictions on financial derivatives and another that would increase the amount of money that individuals can donate to political parties ten-fold.

Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes described the first as a 'Wall Street giveaway' and the second as way to allow Wall Street to flood the political system with more money. 

Referring to the way the bill was released late Tuesday evening just before Midnight, Sarbanes said, 'These two provisions bumped into each other somewhere in the middle of the night, in the corridors of Capitol Hill, up here. 

'They bumped into each other, or maybe they were introduced and one of them said I'll be the quid, and the other one said I'll be the quo,' he said.

'I don't know which is which, but I know this is a quid pro qou, and it's the kind of quid pro qou that is corrupting the machinery of our government and is offensive to the American people.'

Continuing, Sarbanes, said. 'We need to get rid of the quid, we need to eliminate the qou, from this bill, bring it back in a way that we can actually support it. That's what we need to do for the American people.'

Earlier, Michigan Democrat Dan Kildee said he shared a Republican colleague's concern that voting the bill down would lead to a shutdown, as the continuing resolution the government is currently operating off of will sunset at Midnight.  

'The question we need to ask ourselves in this body,' he said, 'is at what price do we keep government open?'

Kildee said there's a lot of good in the legislation before the House. 

But 'the notion that a price has to be paid in order to keep government open and that price is to grant greater power to the wealthiest Americans to have more influence over our political process is just too much for me to take,' he said.

A flabbergasted Kildee said he couldn't believe that of all the problems the House could use this opportunity to solve, such as increased funding for infrastructure or leveling the playing fielding for the less fortunate, it 'is deciding that the one thing we have to do is to make sure that the wealthiest Americans can now spend 10x more money on the political process than they did last year.' 

'Seriously? This is a problem that we have to solve in order to keep government open? I just can't imagine,' he said. 'I just can't imagine that this is the price we have to pay.'

Even as Democrats were threatening to shred the delicately crafted bipartisan bill, House Speaker John Boehner was telling reporters that he expected the bill to pass with votes from both Republicans and Democrats.

'It's a good bill, and I think it reflects the people's priorities,' he said at a Capitol Hill press conference on Thursday morning, later pointing out, 'Listen, if we don't get finished today, we're gonna be here until Christmas!'

The House is scheduled to recess on Friday until early January, but a failure to pass a new continuing resolution would force Congress into staying through the weekend and potentially next week.

Opposing sides: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi encouraged Democrats to vote down the bill - despite the president asking them to support it - while House Speaker John Boehner urged his colleagues to vote for it, lest they have to remain in Washington through the holiday season

Just minutes after Boehner's press conference a procedural vote allowing the bill to come to a full vote barely passed 214 - 212, as a group of conservative members held out their yes votes over fury that the bill did not include language prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security from implementing Obama's immigration orders.

A vote on the final bill was to come later on Thursday, and was expected before close of business. Yet the House still hadn't voted as of early evening as the White House scrambled to whip votes.

Just as liberals and conservatives thought they may have won a second chance at debating the appropriations legislation, the White House threw it's support behind the package as is on Thursday afternoon.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at his daily briefing that Obama backs the compromise proposal and would sign it if it came to his desk.

Earnest said Obama was particularly pleased that that the bill included $5.4 billion to fight the spread of Ebola and 'substantial funding at Obama’s request' for the fight against ISIS.

He said Obama was also happy to learn that the continuing resolution and omnibus bill appropriated $750M for early childhood education and an 'appropriate level of funding' for climate change measures.

In terms of what the bill does not do, he said it doesn't include major Wall Street reforms that Republicans have tried to slap onto spending legislation in the past as well as riders that would 'gut' the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation, Obamacare and the president's immigration actions.

Earnest said Democrats 'should vote their conscience' while making it clear that the president believes the compromise bill is the best option.

Meanwhile, House Minority Leader continued to encourage her caucus not to vote for the bill, sending them all a letter making it crystal clear what she expected of them.

'It is clear from this recess on the floor that the Republicans don't have enough votes to pass the CRomnibus. This increases our leverage to get two offensive provisions of the bill removed: the bank bailout and big money for campaigns provision,' she said.

'However you decide to vote in the end, I thank those who continue to give us leverage to improve the bill.'
