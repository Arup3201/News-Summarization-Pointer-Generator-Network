Hillary Rodham Clinton was inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame on Monday and stressed the importance of women in forming long-lasting peace in Ireland.

The former secretary of state and likely Democratic presidential contender - who is part English, Welsh and Scottish, but not Irish - addressed a luncheon in New York  and said personal relations are crucial in establishing agreements that last.

On the eve of St. Patrick's Day, Irish America magazine praised Clinton for her work on the Irish peace process.

She spoke about her experience meeting women in Northern Ireland and made the case that their involvement was crucial to cementing lasting peace in the region, along with the Good Friday agreement.

She described sitting at a table in Belfast with women from both sides of the conflict and watching as they discovered how much they shared, over cups of tea.

'You cannot bring peace and security to people just by signing an agreement,' she said. 'In fact, most peace agreements don't last.' 

'You cannot bring peace and security to people just by signing an agreement,' Clinton said at the ceremony, citing a time when she was having tea in Belfast with women from both sides of the conflict, who had more in common than they realized

She said that when 'the work of peace permeates down to the kitchen table, to the backyard, to the neighborhood, around cups of tea, there's a much greater chance the agreement will hold.'

Clinton did not address the controversy surrounding her use of private email during her time as secretary of state at the event. 

Previous inductees of the hall of fame include former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and media personalities Bill O'Reilly and Chris Matthews.
