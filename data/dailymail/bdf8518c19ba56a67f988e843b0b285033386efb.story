Christopher turner lived in a £1,000-a-month flat under a mile from where he was caught begging

A beggar who claimed to be homeless 
while living off benefits in a £1,000-a-month flat in a wealthy suburb 
has been convicted of fraud.

With his faithful dog by his side, Christopher Turner, 51, was a fixture outside a branch of the HSBC bank for five years.

He
 used a selection of scrappy, handwritten cardboard signs, some 
illustrated with a crucifix or a star of David, bearing 
sympathy-inducing pleas such as: ‘Homeless – could you please help – I 
would be very grateful - thank you, God bless’.

But
 in reality, the donations he received of up to £80 a day only went to 
supplement a string of benefits, including housing assistance.

Locals
 said Turner considered masquerading as a homeless beggar to be his ‘9-5
 job’.

He would then go home to his flat one mile away in a leafy road 
in upmarket Surbiton, South West London, where rents cost around £1,000 a
 month for a similar-sized home.

He was arrested in October and charged with begging and fraud, which he admitted at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court.

Sergeant
 Dave Williams, from Kingston police, said: ‘This man has a home. He 
receives housing and other financial assistance to support his living.

‘There
 are genuine homeless people sleeping rough.’

Residents took to the 
online forum Surbition.com to applaud Turner’s conviction.

One
 wrote: ‘The most hilarious incident I have seen was when he was having 
an argument with what appeared to be a girlfriend when he said, “You can
 stop complaining, I am the one who has to go out to work all day!”.’

Another
 said: ‘This guy has a flat in Surb and is definitely not homeless! A 
lady I know offered to re-home the dog but he refused as uses it to beg.
 He def has money. Feel sorry for the dog.

‘He
 probably makes more money than some of the idiots who donate to him, 
but that doesn’t stop them doing it. It never fails to surprise me how 
many people give money to people like this.’

A
 third local wrote: ‘He’s got a cozy flat, a girlfriend and lives on 
benefits which he tops up with about £80 he makes every day doing his 
9-5 outside the bank with his begging bowl. It’s about time he was 
rumbled.’

Fraud: Turner used several different handwritten signs in an effort to provoke sympathy from passers-by while begging, included some with Christian crosses and one with a Jewish-style Star of David

Warm and dry: But he would then go home to his flat in this block one mile away in a leafy road in upmarket Surbiton, South West London, where rents cost around £1,000 a month for a similar-sized home

Even the police 
commented on social media, with Kingston police tweeting: ‘Chris Turner 
convicted of begging & fraud. Regularly begs with signs saying he’s 
homeless when he’s not!’

But residents appear to have known for years he was a fake.

He
 was outed as a fraud three years ago on Surbiton.com, after he was 
caught stashing his begging signs before heading off home. One user 
wrote: ‘The lowlife who sits out side HSBC is NOT homeless.

‘He
 begs for money and then proceeds to the Londis shop to buy super 
strength beer (often shouting and swearing). He even borrows the dog 
from his female sidekick to get extra sympathy.’

Turner must pay £113 in fines and costs, which will be deducted from his benefits, after pleading guilty to begging and fraud.
