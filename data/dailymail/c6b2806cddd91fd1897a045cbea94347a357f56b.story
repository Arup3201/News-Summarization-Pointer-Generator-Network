Fresh doubts were voiced last night about Britain’s proposed new high-speed rail line amid warnings that it will not succeed in regenerating the North.

A damning report raises fears that promises by David Cameron and other Ministers that High Speed 2 will deliver essential economic benefits are ‘a myth’.

It even warns that areas around proposed HS2 stations would be simply ‘Potemkin villages’ - fake regeneration created ‘for political reasons’ using large taxpayer subsidies.

The claims - by respected free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs - come after it emerged that new Treasury Minister Andrea Leadsom had called the economic case for HS2 ‘questionable’.

More than 20 Tory MPs are set to rebel this week in Commons votes intended to pave the way for the controversial £50 billion project. HS2 is scheduled to provide a 225mph link between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds by 2030.

Chancellor George Osborne has called the line an ‘engine for growth’ for the North and the Midlands, while the Prime Minister has said the 330-mile network will transform the nation’s ‘economic geography’.

But the think tank report – to be published tomorrow – concludes that there is little evidence for the promised major economic benefits.

The report, entitled ‘Failure to Transform: High-Speed Rail and the Regeneration Myth’, said similar boasts were made for Britain’s first high-speed line – HS1 in Kent, which cost an estimated £11billion at today’s prices.

Dissent: New Treasury Minister Andrea Leadsom has vowed to fight HS2

According to the report, the line failed to revive the East Kent economy and some parts of the region have similar rates of unemployment to depressed industrial cities in the North.

The think tank also cast wider doubt on the benefits of faster rail links by citing the case of Doncaster in South Yorkshire.

It argues that Doncaster had ‘enjoyed a fast rail link’ to London for several decades, with its first 125mph ‘High Speed Train’ service introduced in the late 1970s and electrification of the route completed in 1991.

Despite that, the town was ranked 42nd worst out of 318 English boroughs in the 2010 Index of Multiple Deprivation.

‘Clearly, a fast rail link to London has not transformed Doncaster,’ the report concludes.

It also suggests that any boost to specific areas from having a new HS2 station would be limited. ‘The areas around the HS2 stations will of course be redeveloped if the scheme goes ahead.

‘But these new districts will most likely be “Potemkin villages” – examples of fake regeneration built for political reasons using large taxpayer subsidies and appropriating property from existing owners.’

The criticisms will be seized on by opponents of HS2 who claim the massive expense and upheaval is not justified.

Just this weekend it emerged that before she was made a Treasury Minister earlier this month, Northamptonshire MP Mrs Leadsom vowed to fight the project - which passes through her constituency - claiming its economic case was ‘questionable and rapidly deteriorating’.

Last night, Government sources were unable to say whether Mrs Leadsom would be taking part in this week’s Commons votes.

But the Department for Transport dismissed the think tank report as ‘bizarre’ and insisted the line would provide a ‘huge economic boost’.

A source said: ‘The idea that HS1 hasn’t brought significant benefits is just wrong.

‘Just look at the regeneration around King’s Cross or ask the people of Ashford [the site of a HS1 international station].

‘And the idea that better transport connections don’t help places to grow and prosper is plain bizarre.

‘HS2 will create 100,000 jobs and provide a huge economic boost to the North and Midlands, which is why city leaders across these regions support it.’

Last year, HS2 Ltd, the publicly owned company overseeing the project, published a major study by consultant KPMG claiming the line could boost the UK economy by as much as £15 billion a year.

But last night, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who is set  to rebel against HS2 in the  votes this week, said: ‘This new report confirms what we know – HS2 will not solve the North/South divide.’
