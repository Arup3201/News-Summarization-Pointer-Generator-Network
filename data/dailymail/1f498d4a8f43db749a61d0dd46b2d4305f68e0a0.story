A couple has won the right to use the trademark Golden Balls for their company after a six-year legal battle that went to the European Court of Justice.

Businessman Gus Bodur, 50, and his wife Inez, 49, have been forced to shell out more than £100,000 in legal fees since the FIFA Ballon d'Or - a globally recognised accolade given to the world's best footballer - claimed the name of their sportswear shop was a copyright infringement.

The prize has been given annually since 2010, when France Football's Ballon d'Or and the men's FIFA World Player of the Year award merged, and has been won by Barcelona's Lionel Messi every year since.

Family business: Inez and Gus Bodur with Golden Balls products in 2009 outside their West Hampstead store before they were forced to close in 2010

The Bodurs, from Cricklewood in 
north-west London, were forced to close their store in West Hapstead, 
north London, in 2010 after the expense of the case - and the sleepless 
nights - became too much for the small business to cope with.

But they say they are delighted with the ruling from Europe's highest court, which will allow them to trade again under their original name.

Mrs Bodur said: 'After the hearing, we were crying, laughing and jumping around.

'We have been waiting so long for this day and we felt so relieved that the judges were saying what we have been saying since day one - that there was no similarity.'

Mr Bodur said: 'We are still in shock.
We thought all along that we were right but these large corporations 
have so much money, you don't know.'

The
couple, who have two children, have been selling their sportswear since
2001, when they obtained the trademark for Golden Balls.

Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow was spotted out in Covent Garden in 2002 wearing one of their T-shirts as business boomed.

When Victoria Beckham revealed her nickname for her husband David was 'Golden Balls', they wrote to the Beckhams to check there were no legal issues, and had no problems.

But when they licensed the name to entertainment company Endemol to use for a game show hosted by TV comedian Jasper Carrott in 2007, they were contacted by organisers of the Ballon d'Or - French for 'Ball of Gold'.

The show was shelved as award organisers Intra-presse accused the Bodurs of infringing copyright.

The two entrepreneurs claimed victory in the European trademark disputes court in 2010.

But an appeal granted some rights back to the organisers, who merged with FIFA that same year.

The defiant Bodurs, however, vowed to take the case all the way to the Court of Justice, bankrolling their fight with money from their licensing deal with Endemol.

Mrs Bodur said: 'The next stage is to get our legal fees paid and to get compensation for the loss of business and for what our family has gone through in the last six years.'

The couple, who have been receiving some royalties from the online version of the TV show Golden Balls, now hope a new series will be launched.

They say they have plans to open a new sports cafe selling Golden Balls merchandise.
