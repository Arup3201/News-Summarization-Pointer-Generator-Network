Jose Mourinho has invited Frank Lampard to return to Chelsea as his assistant manager after admitting that letting the midfielder go was one of the most difficult acts of his career.

The Chelsea boss praised Lampard in the highest terms, saying he was the best all-round midfield player of the past decade. He also insisted the 35-year-old’s move away from Stamford Bridge this summer is merely a ‘little break’,  not the end of his career there.

Mourinho hinted that Ashley Cole’s time at the club may not be over, revealing he has yet to talk to the left back about his future.

Job for life: Frank Lampard can return to Chelsea any time he wants, says Jose Mourinho

Top dog: Mourinho also described Lampard as the most complete all-round midfielder of the past decade

Cole, 33, is also out of contract but 
no official announcement has been made following the player’s comment on
 Twitter last month that he was ‘weighing up his options’ and ‘sadly it 
does not look like Chelsea will be one of them’.

Lampard,
 meanwhile, is considering a move to Major League Soccer in the States 
after leaving as Chelsea’s all-time record goal-scorer with 11 major 
honours, including three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the 
Champions League and Europa League.

Mourinho
 said: ‘You can’t imagine how difficult it was. I think only Frank knows
 that, but at the same time I can feel some happiness about the process 
because, for sure, he comes back to Chelsea.

‘For
 sure. Everybody wants it. Mr Abramovich — the No 1, the most important 
person — wants Frank to be back very much, I want him to be back and the
 staff want him back, so he comes back for sure.

‘He
 can come back the way he wants. Mr Abramovich has left  the door 
completely open for him on the understanding Frank  can do anything he 
wants at this club. To repeat Mr Abramovich’s words, “He can come back 
the way he wants”.

‘He can 
be a coach, he can start at the academy, he can start being my assistant
 at the same time because he is doing his coaching badges, or he can 
start in a different role.

‘It’s not the end of Frank Lampard’s career in Chelsea. It’s just a little break.

‘He will be back, hopefully for many, many years, because he’s one of the most important players in the history of Chelsea.’

Lampard’s
 former manager acknowledged the midfielder’s determination to continue 
playing for two or three more years, but said a footballer of his 
calibre needs to compete in a league where he is the ‘top man’.

Lampard
 completed only 11 Barclays Premier League matches last  season and 
Mourinho revealed he had advised him to give up international football 
after this World Cup, having already won 104 caps.

‘The
 World Cup is the perfect way for somebody with more than 100 caps to 
finish his career in the national team,’ said Mourinho.

‘I told him, 
“Don’t go more than the World Cup. The World Cup is the right moment to 
finish”. He accepts that. To finish around 110 caps is a crazy number 
for an outfield player. He’s not a goalkeeper that plays till 40 years 
of age.

‘He’s a man to play
 a major role in a team, not like what happened in the last year. I 
think for him, for his mentality, for his personality, it’s better to 
get a club and probably a competition where he is really the top man.

‘Lampard is a No 6, a No 10 and he wears the No 8, because he is the six and the 10 and he becomes the eight.

‘For
 me, he is the best No 8 I have managed, for sure, and I don’t see a 
better No 8 in the last decade. He was the best for 10 years. I don’t 
see another one.’

Cole 
retired from international football after being left out of Roy 
Hodgson’s squad for Brazil, but Mourinho said the defender was still in 
the ‘perfect condition’.

The
 left back started only five Premier League matches in 2014 after losing
 his place to Cesar Azpilicueta following a rib injury last autumn, but 
Mourinho said he pushed Cole towards the end of the campaign in the hope
 he would be selected for the World Cup.
