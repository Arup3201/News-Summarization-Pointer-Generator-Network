A 73-year-old former BBC producer arrested as part of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse investigation was this afternoon released on bail.

Wilfred De'Ath, a producer for Savile on BBC radio shoe Teen Scene, was arrested at a Cambridge property at 7.15am and taken into custody.

He was the third suspect to be arrested on suspicion of sexual offences after former pop star Gary Glitter, 68, and comic Freddie Starr, 69.

Released on bail: Wilfred De'Ath, a producer for Savile on BBC radio shoe Teen Scene, was arrested at a Cambridge property at 7.15am and taken into custody

De'Ath was arrested under Operation 
Yewtree - the Metropolitan Police investigation into alleged offending 
by the former disc jockey and 'others'.

Scotland Yard said the man, who was named by local sources rather than police, was bailed to a date in December pending further inquiries.

Neighbours told the Daily Telegraph that police removed items in black bags from Mr De'ath's one-bedroom flat in a housing association block.

Local resident Sue Hall told the newspaper: 'I saw two marked police cars when I got up - one over the road and the other at the back of the flats.

'When I went out, there were four officers,' the 63-year-old added. 'We are a very quiet community here because all the residents are getting on a bit.'

Another resident said it appeared Mr 
De'Ath was dressed normally in a jacket and trousers as he got into the 
back of an unmarked police car.

Glitter, whose real name 
is Paul Gadd, was arrested first and questioned at a London 
police station after being detained at his home in the capital.

Starr was arrested next. He was 
arrested twice and released on bail for a second time earlier this month
as part of the Savile abuse inquiry.

He has consistently denied any involvement in the alleged abuse.

Last month he branded Savile 'despicable' and 'disgusting', and urged police to interview him so he could clear his name.

Savile, who died last year at the age 
of 84, is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific 
abusers, with hundreds of possible victims.

Scotland Yard is leading a national 
investigation into the television and radio star's activities and 
pursuing hundreds of lines of inquiry.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
