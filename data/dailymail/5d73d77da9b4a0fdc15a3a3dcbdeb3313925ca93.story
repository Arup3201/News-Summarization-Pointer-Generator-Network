Diego Costa has flown to Belgrade to see 'miracle doctor' Marijana Kovacevic in a desperate attempt to be fit for the biggest match of his career.

The Serb uses placenta to help players recover quickly from muscle injuries and on Saturday Costa wants to play for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in the Champions League final.

The striker has been diagnosed with a grade one hamstring tear, sustained against Barcelona last weekend in La Liga.

That sort of injury usually keeps players out of action for around 15 days, which would rule him out of the showpiece event in Lisbon if the treatment does not work.

Costa will rejoin the Atletico squad on Wednesday after flying back from Serbia.

Kovacevic has treated several Premier League stars before, including then-Arsenal striker Robin van Persie and Chelsea's Frank Lampard.

Yossi Benayoun, while at Liverpool, was privy to her treatment and gave the doctor a glowing endorsement. 

'There were no animal parts used and no injections,' he said.

'The doctor has treated a lot of players and seems to be held in very high regard.

'She explained everything to me beforehand and told me she would be using fluid from a placenta that had come from a woman.

'Nothing went into the muscle itself. It was just a case of massaging the liquid on to the skin around the affected area.

'It meant I was able to play again within a fortnight and help the team at an important time.'

His manager at the time, Rafa Benitez 
said: 'She is a doctor with a degree in pharmacology and is really good 
with muscle injuries.

Explanation: QPR midfielder Yossi Benayoun spoke highly of the controversial treatment

'If a
 player is supposed to be out for four weeks and he is back available 
within two or three days, and everything is clear, they are natural 
products, then why not? It's curative.

'It's not trying to improve the performance of the player, it's trying to cure him.

'We had some players that were injured, and with natural products and treatments they are available, and that's surely a positive.'

Chelsea, who are trying to buy Costa from Atletico, will be wary of whether he is played through injury in the Champions League and the subsequent World Cup.

The gaffer: Diego Simeone is desperate for his star man to be able to take on Real Madrid

Both Andriy Shevchenko and Fernando Torres arrived at the club after being played while suffering from different complaints.

Diego Simeone has played Costa even when not fully fit on a couple of occasions during Atletico's run to the Spanish league title.

Both times he has been substituted early in the next match, with the gamble not paying off.

Atletico midfielder Arda Turan is also racing against time to be fit for the final. He trained on Tuesday, although not with the other players.
