It's usually the length of a skirt that puts schoolgirls at odds with teachers over uniform policy.

But the headmistress at one primary school has issued a fashion clampdown – on frilly socks.

Elaborate ‘princess socks’, decorated with frills, bows and ribbons, are considered a ‘trip hazard’.

Any pupil who flouts the rules will be told to replace them with another pair from Primark.

A playground craze has seen pupils wearing increasingly elaborate 'princess' socks decorated with frills, bows and ribbons. But they have been banned at Kingsholm Primary School, in Gloucester

Headmistress Jan Buckland turned against the flowery footwear after a pupil fell over - and sent a letter home to the parents of the 438 pupils, citing health and safety fears. She imposed a blanket ban on frills larger than 3cm

The ban at Kingsholm Primary School in 
Gloucester came after one girl suffered a fall which was judged – in a 
health and safety assessment form – to have been caused by the garments.

Parent Tracy Rudge, 42, started the playground craze by making them for
her six-year-old daughter Lily-Jo.

They proved so popular she made hundreds of pairs for her daughter’s classmates, which she sells for £2.50 a pair.

The cleaner has now accused school officials of going ‘health and safety mad’.

‘My daughter could fall and break her arm doing PE, but she’s not allowed to wear frilly socks?

‘It’s a joke – shoelaces are a million times more dangerous than the socks,’ she said.

'The parents of more than 400 pupils were told that frills larger than 
3cm (1.1ins) were banned following an incident in the playground.

However, mother-of-three Mrs Rudge says the fall was not caused by the 
socks – and many parents are defying the ban.

Any child found now breaching the order will be forced to change into a 
plain pair bought from Primark, and parents given a ‘reminder’ letter.

Headmistress Jan Buckland said it was clear the items were a ‘trip 
hazard’.

‘The governing body and I decided that a ban was appropriate 
because the frill had been trailing on the floor,’ she said.

‘If parents are defiant, the kids will have to change out of them  if they arrive in the building wearing them.’

The school refused to answer questions about what would happen to the children if they continued to flout the ban.
