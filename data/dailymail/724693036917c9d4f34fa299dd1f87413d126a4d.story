Design duo Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker  exhibited an affinity towards the dark side at their AW15 show on Friday night. 

The relentlessly alluring theme of Gothic romanticism seeped throughout the collection - named Persephone - thanks to delicate fabrics and feminine details nostalgic of the Victorian age.

Frills were rife, dominating the collars or lining the dress, and even made their mark on footwear. 

PPQ's Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parke did Gothic romanticism with a feminine collection nostalgic of the Victorian age

High-collared translucent silk shirts with dramatic frills echoed the romantic theme, and a long draping fur-lined coat lingered more towards 1940s wartime fashion. 

Silk blouses and sheer fabrics flowed down the runway, followed by luxurious felt wool coats that embraced winter’s charm and highlighted the feminine silhouette.

Delicate fabrics , ruffles, frills and feminine details nostalgic of the Victorian age dominated the catwalk 

Other pieces were modernised in their shapes and short cuts, plunging necklines and sheer fabrics added a touch of sensuality, whilst remaining within the realms of romantic traditionalism.

The decadent, sculpted shapes of certain dresses were reminiscent of ballet costume pieces, depicting a softer grace in their simplicity and restraint, whilst still keeping  the Gothic stance intact. 

The result? Dresses that were unapologetically haunting.

The collection was a surprising shift from PPQ's previous collections thanks to its dominating Gothic romantic form. But judging by the audience, who wholeheartedly lapped it up in all its dark beauty, it was a well-received one.
