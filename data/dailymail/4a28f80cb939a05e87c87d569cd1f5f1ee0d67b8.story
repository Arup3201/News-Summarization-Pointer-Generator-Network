This was the scene at a Cornish beauty spot this morning after walkers discovered a 20ft long whale washed up on a beach.

The decomposed carcass of the huge mammal was found at the popular holiday destination of Pentewan Sands near Mevagissey in Cornwall.

Stunned dog walkers could be seen stopping to take pictures of what is believed to be a dead juvenile Minke whale.

Although it was in an advanced state of decay, it was a rare opportunity to witness the size of the seagoing giants up close.

A spokesman from Falmouth Coastguard said it was alerted to the discovery about 3pm today.

Their colleagues at Mevagissey dispatched a team to the beach this afternoon to take measurements and a report is due to be sent to the Receiver of Wreck.

The spokesman said it was the responsibility of the owner of the beach to dispose of the carcass, adding that it was not yet clear what kind of whale had been washed up. 

Although it is relatively rare for them to be washed up on British beaches, Cornwall is no stranger to whale sightings.

A steady stream of onlookers arrived at the beach today to catch a glimpse of the giant 20ft whale

Two years ago, a full size adult Fin whale weighing 65 tonnes washed up alive just along the coast at Carlyon Bay.

Sadly however, despite the efforts of volunteers the mammal had to be humanely destroyed.

According to the whaledolphintrust.co.uk, Minke are the smallest of the baleen whales found in UK waters, measuring between seven and ten metres when fully grown.

They can be found in seas across the Northern hemisphere, except in the Arctic Ocean, and are often seen off the coasts of Ireland and Scotland.
