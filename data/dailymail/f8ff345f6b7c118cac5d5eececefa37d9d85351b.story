Some scientists suspect that speaking and making tools share the same neurological pathways, because our ancestors learned both skills at the same time.

To test this theory modern man will be taught to make Stone Age hand axes, which were developed 500,000 years ago.

It aims to investigate the role of stone tools in human brain evolution, especially the key areas of the brain related to language.

Archaeologists at Emory University in Georgia, Atlanta will train 20 people for 100 hours each so they can learn the art of knapping. This technique was used in the Stone Age to craft tools like hand axes (shown). It was used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago and involves stroking a piece of flint with a quartzite ‘hammerstone’

Knapping was used by our ancestors and involves striking a piece of flint with a quartzite 'hammerstone' to break and shape flint.

Dr Dietrich Stout, who is leading the experiment, will use MRI scans to monitor the link between tool making and language.

He believes that our brain approaches physical tasks, such as making a tool, in the same way it approaches language, reports Wired.

Participants in the study will undergo an MRI scan when they listen to a story to show how language activates their brains.

They will then have more MRI scans while they are learning knapping to see whether the process of tool making - bashing one rock against another to create the desired shape - activates the same areas of the brain as forming sentences.

It is hard for scientists to say precisely when humans started making tools because the more primitive remains look like a natural object rather than a human artefact.

The oldest-known instruments are the Oldowan stone tools from Ethiopia, which date back about 2.6 million years.

The Acheulean tool technology period - up to 1.76 million years ago - featured large stone hand axes made from flint and quartzite.

Towards the end of this period, the tools became more refined and then followed the so-called Levallois technique, which saw the creation of scrapers, slicers, needled and flattened needles.

About 50,000 years ago more refined and specialised flint tools were made and used by Neanderthals and it is believed it was at this stage tools were constructed out of bone.

As human culture advanced, artefacts such as fish hooks, buttons and bone needles were used. 

Dr Dietrich Stout (pictured), who is leading the experiment, will use MRI scans to monitor the link between tool making and language. He thinks similar areas of the brain may be responsible for both. His team are looking for volunteers to take part in the study

The Acheulean tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - featured large stone hand axes (stock image shown) made from flint and quartzite. However, it is hard to know precisely when humans started making tools in history

The experts will also run a battery of other tests to investigate the effect, such as eye tracking, memory tests and video analysis of the act of tool making.

Participants will range in age from 18 to 50 years old and must be right-handed, with no history of neurological illness - or of making Stone Age tools.

'We need novices who will really commit to learning this prehistoric craft,' Dr Stout said in a blog post from Emory University, where people can sign up for the study.

They say the ideal candidates need to be 'curious about who we are as humans and where we came from.'

It is apparently the first neuroscientific study of real-world craft skill acquisition over time, according to Dr Stout.

Last month Tel-Aviv based designers re-imagined the tool from 1.4 million years ago. The Man Made project used 3D scanning and printing to create different handles and grips. Pictured is one of the designs, a hand-held grip that could be placed in the palm of either the left or right hand to modify a classic hand axe
