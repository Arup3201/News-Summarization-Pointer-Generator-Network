Sportsmail columnist MARTIN KEOWN answered YOUR questions after another interesting week of Champions League football, including Arsenal's disappointing 3-1 defeat at home to Monaco on Wednesday night.

The former Gunners and England defender analysed the tie at the Emirates Stadium, with subjects ranging from Per Mertesacker's abject performance and Arsene Wenger's tactics to whether Olivier Giroud is lacking quality in the big games.

Also on the agenda was the small matter of the Capital One Cup final this weekend as Chelsea play Tottenham at Wembley, as well as the quality of English football.

There’s no conspiracy, Charlie - no way! It’s all propaganda from Jose Mourinho.

It was a big statement for him to go on Sky - a company he doesn’t have the best of relationships with - and say they, and referees, don’t give him a fair deal.

I think it’s disrespectful to the Premier League and everything it stands for. Fair competition is the basis of every good competition – if you win the Premier League, you deserve to.

But if you question it, like Mourinho is doing, you question the integrity of the game. And that is wrong.

I’m not fooled by his charm and magnetism, but people seem scared to speak out against him. Perhaps they don’t want to get involved in a slanging match, but he needs to be pulled up about this.

Look at Ronald Koeman after Southampton’s loss to Liverpool on Sunday. He could have completely gone off on one about the penalties they should have been awarded, or that Simon Mignolet should have been sent off. But he didn’t. There was no mention of campaigns or conspiracies by him.

People know that players get tired over busy periods, but what about the referees?

Players are supported after a match, people at the club will tell where they went wrong and help to prepare them for the next match. But a referee is his own entity and has to pick up pieces in isolation.

It must affect their confidence after a bad game. They need help and support the same way players do.

What else is difficult for a referee is that he has no idea of the feeling of being wronged like players do. It’s so frustrating when you try to plead with the referee, but it seeps into your performance. You feel like you’ve been sinned.

It used to wind me up when we played Manchester United and referees would call the players by their first names. But the second I was in trouble it was, ‘Keown, get over here!’.

It was a terrible tackle and I would expect Matic to be angry. As I'm sure you would.

I think you have to allow someone the emotion to react, to a certain extent, but it has cost him a place in Sunday’s cup final.

It seems unfair, as he could've had leg broken. But he has to know that you can’t do that. He should have just laid on the pitch.

Players go down with far less these days, and it looked to me like he had the right to be rolling around on the floor for the next ten minutes.

I don’t think I would've reacted the same as Matic, I would have stayed on the floor, pointing at my leg in exasperated fashion, hoping the officials would sort out the situation.

One time when we played Chelsea, Nigel Spackman punched me on the back of the head so hard I felt his knuckles. My first thought was to clump him back, but I quickly changed my mind and went down and he was sent off. There’s an automatic process that kicks in to stop you punching someone on the pitch.

Unfortunately for me, Dennis Wise was on hand to walk all over the top of me while I was on the floor, until Steve Bould dragged him off, that is.

I think Chelsea will win it, JJ. Tottenham’s 5-3 win at White Hart Lane this season was astonishing, but when you get to a final it’s different. It’s where the inexperience of the likes of Kane, Ryan Mason and Eric Dier may be a problem.

There’s know-how in Chelsea team. They know how to to dictate the pace of the game and play it at their own pace.

Tottenham will be confident after their victory on New Year's Day, but this is not at home - it’s at Wembley.

They’ll have to put the pressure and fanfare of the final to one side and concentrate on the game. Chelsea have done all this before.

Cahill has only had one or two bad games this season, including the one you mention, Ken, but has found himself out of the team. Jose Mourinho often looks for blame and has clearly identified Cahill as culpable in certain matches.

Zouma is developing nicely, but in the long term I would think he will partner Cahill, not John Terry.

At the moment, Mourinho is showing that Terry will stay in the team regardless, but it might be different next year.  Maybe Mourinho is testing Cahill - seeing how he responds to falling down the pecking order.

Zouma definitely looks like he has the potential to be top class. When he hones in on an opposition player he can make it very difficult for them. When Chelsea played Everton he dealt with Romelu Lukaku comfortably, and he’s one of the quickest and strongest strikers in the league.

I've always been a keen admirer of Kompany, Daisy. But he needs to wait for the game to come to him and not go flying in. He went flying in too often against Barcelona on Tuesday when he would have been better off keeping the shape of the defence in tact.

I think he might have come back from injury before he was ready to. He’s a big man who needs to be a 100 per cent fit to carry that huge frame around.

He’s a very important player for them, but he’s often guilty of wanting to do everyone else’s job – it’s part of his nature.

Playing centre half is about being in the right place at right time. If you rush out of position you can leave big spaces in behind for attackers to move into.

He would have been embarrassed by what happened, Ashley. He carries the flag for France around Europe. Since he left, France have won the World Cup and the European Championship. The French are very proud of him.

Last night could be a defining moment. They dominated possession but got thumped. I think he might rethink his tactics. He sees everything and is a quick learner.

He has to decide whether it’s more important to win or play attractive football. Last night he didn’t underestimate Monaco but overestimated his own team.

It looked like he was trying too hard. He was playing against a French team, and it felt like he  wanted to show how far he’d come.

He’s got to get over what happened last night. When people say we we had lots of strong characters in our Arsenal team, that’s because we had all had nightmare games somewhere along the line.

His goals have been vital to Arsenal, as you mention, but he has to believe he’s good enough. There’s the option of Danny Welbeck in the middle, but there’s lots of work to do there as well.

I think he does too much work for the team tracking back. He needs to work on his runs, so he can occupy both centre halves when receiving the ball. Wenger must decide who’s in the middle sooner rather than later.

I wouldn't write Arsenal off, James. When you look at number of chances they had last night, they're still in it. Though Monaco might just have too much for them.

I was very impressed with their defenders – they all looked efficient, strong and good on the break.

If Arsenal do win it’d be Wenger’s finest hour. He’ll be relishing that he’ll get another chance to face them, rubbing hands together.

He’s a proud Frenchman returning home, but it’s not a trip for nostalgia -  there’s a job to do. He’s a very determined person, and two early goals would turn the tie on its head.

Well, James, Wenger had a nightmare - he knew it would happen, which makes it worse. He understood them well enough, but they still got beaten.

The midfield was packed with imagination and ability, but not enough defensive quality.  Francis Coquelin was charging about on his own, trying to do it all.

Arsenal didn’t have balance. It was like there was a magnet down the centre of the pitch, and all their players were drawn towards it.

Arsenal have to learn to play with their heads. They’re either too slow or too manic.

I think he’s under pressure. Gabriel is there, ready to play, and it looks as if Calum Chambers will become a centre half, rather than a right back.

If things don’t go well, it looks like Wenger has the necessary players to replace him, unlike in the past. You only get so long under Wenger to stake a claim. He always invests time on each player, but he may want to invest time in someone else now.

Look what happened with Thomas Vermaelen – it’s debatable whether Mertesacker is better.

I think Wenger still believes in him, he feels he gives organisation to the defence. But it’s a balancing act with his lack of mobility.
