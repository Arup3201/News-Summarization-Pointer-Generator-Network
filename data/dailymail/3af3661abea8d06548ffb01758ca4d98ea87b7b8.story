A college student is still missing after he vanished in the middle of the night while on a surfing trip with friends.

Scott Fippinger, 20, of San Diego, California, was at a campsite near campsite near Rosarito Beach in Mexico, just south of the American border, when he got up and left the tent at around 3:30a.m. last Wednesday morning.

That is the last time anyone saw the young man.

Now, Scott's father, Eric Fippinger, is revealing that he and his wife believe their son likely fell to his death off one of the steep cliffs in the area.

'We are assuming that he went over the cliff, into the ocean and got swept out by the tide,' Eric told U-T San Diego. 

A friend says he saw Scott's light go on when he left the tent, and assumed the young man was going to the bathroom.

The following day his phone and a piece of clothing possibly from his pajamas was found in the area between the tent and a nearby cliff.

There were unusually high winds that evening, and dirt on the side of the cliff seemed to show an impact spot the next day.

High tide happened at 3:38am that morning as well, meaning Scott's body, had he fallen, would have quickly been taken out to sea.

Now, his parents are just holding out hope that they can find their son's body.

'We are basically using all the resources we can and relying heavily on all the fishermen and local population to keep an eye out,' said Eric.

A former pilot, Eric has now begun searching for his son from an aircraft.
