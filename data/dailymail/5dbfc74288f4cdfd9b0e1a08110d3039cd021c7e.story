A heavily pregnant woman who was twice sent home from hospital and told to take painkillers died just weeks after giving birth to her baby girl.

Barbara Makovecz, 44, from Manchester, went to North Manchester General Hospital complaining of back pain and difficulty breathing when she was 37 weeks pregnant.

Her husband, Carl, 49, insists he told doctors she had already survived breast cancer, and begged them to carry out blood tests and scans, he says his wife was sent home and told to take painkillers.

Barbara Makovecz, 44, died eight weeks after giving birth to Bethany. She visited North Manchester General Hospital when she was heavily pregnant and started suffering back pain but was sent away with painkillers

Nine days later, she suffered a severe brain seizure and was rushed to Saint Mary’s Hospital in Manchester city centre.

Her baby, Bethany Grace, was delivered by emergency Caesarean - and it was only then doctors discovered she had cancer.

Mrs Makovecz, also mother to Liam, 19, Jack, eight, and Samuel, three, went on to have further seizures, causing her to lose her memory and be unable to care for new daughter.

Doctors discovered tumours in her brain and major organs and when radiation therapy was unsuccessful, told devastated husband that there was nothing they could do.

Mrs Makovecz, a Post Office worker, died just eight weeks after giving birth in September last year.

Mrs Makovecz was given radiotherapy but it was not successful and she died in a hospice. Mr Makovecz has had to give up his job to care for the couple's children. He is pictured with Bethany, Jack (left) and Sam (right)

Her family have made a formal 
complaint to North Manchester General Hospital - but say a year on they 
are still waiting for answers. Mr Makovecz is also taking legal advice. 

Mrs Makovecz first went to North Manchester General on July 3 last year and returned again the following day.

But both times medics sent her home with painkillers, believing the back pain was due to a strain caused by coughing.

Her husband, who has given up his job in manufacturing to care for the couple’s young children, said: ‘During the pregnancy Barbara had been looking radiant and beautiful. But then around 35 weeks she started getting back pain.

After Bethany was delivered, Mrs Makovecz was diagnosed with tumours in her brain and other major organs

‘I took her to North Manchester General 
and both times explained she had had cancer before. The pain had got so 
bad she was in agony, but doctors just told us to go home and take 
painkillers.

Then she had a brain seizure at home and the doctors at St Mary’s said the only way to save the baby was with an emergency caesarean.

‘Straight after the birth both seemed fine but then Barbara had two more seizures and after an MRI scan they discovered the tumours.

‘I was heartbroken, but begged doctors not to give up on her because I hadn’t.

‘After
radiation therapy at The Christie she came home and I looked after her 
and the children, but doctors told us she didn’t have long to live. So 
we had Bethany Grace christened at the chapel in The Christie and 
Barbara died 11 days later in a hospice.

‘I had been taking the baby to visit her but she wasn’t strong enough to do things like change her, and she didn’t know who I was before she died.

‘It was the hardest thing ever. It’s been nearly a year now and it’s been a battle with North Manchester General to get answers.

‘If she had been diagnosed earlier she might not have had the seizures and lost her memory. I just want the hospital to learn from what happened so another family don’t go through what we have.’

It is understood bosses from Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs North Manchester General, have met Barbara’s family this week to discuss the complaint.

Dr Jimmy Stuart, clinical director 
for A&E at The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'This is a 
sad and indeed tragic case and our sympathies go out to Mr Makovecz and 
his family.

'Mrs 
Makovecz presented to A&E at North Manchester General Hospital on 
two occasions in July 2012 with back pain coming on after coughing 
whilst 37 weeks pregnant.

Mr Makovecz said: 'I was heartbroken when the doctors told us the cancer had returned, but I begged them not to give up on her because I hadn't'

'Mrs Makovecz was seen by two doctors who both inquired about the patient’s past medical history and there was no note of a past history of breast cancer made by either doctor.

'The patient was given appropriate pain relieving medication and discharged. There is no note of Mr or Mrs Makovecz requesting blood tests or scans.

'Mrs Makovecz unfortunately presented nine days later having had a seizure which was initially thought to be due to a complication of her pregnancy but turned out to be due to metastases on her brain. She died some weeks later.

'Mr Makovecz first complained to the trust in February 2013 and the Trust has met with him on three occasions.

'Our clinical director for A&E met with him within five days of the Trust receiving his complaint and there have been two further meetings with Mr Makovecz. We have been very open in our dealings with Mr Makovecz and a thorough investigation has been carried out.'
