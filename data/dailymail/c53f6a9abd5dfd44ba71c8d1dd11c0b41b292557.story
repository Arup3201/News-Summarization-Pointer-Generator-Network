A cast of Napoleon Bonaparte's death mask has sold for almost £170,000 at auction after spending years stored in a family attic.

The mask was made for a British chaplain shortly after the French emperor’s death on the South Atlantic island of St Helena in 1821, where he was exiled.

The rare find went under the hammer at Bonhams Book, Map and Manuscript sale in Knightsbridge, central London, yesterday and sold for £169,250 - well above its estimate of £40,000 to £60,000.

Under the hammer: The mask (cast, pictured left) was made for a British chaplain shortly after French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's (right) death on the South Atlantic island of St Helena in 1821, where he was exiled

Known as the 'Boys cast', it was made for the Reverend Richard Boys, senior chaplain of St Helena, two days after Napoleon's death - and when the Emperor's body was beginning to decompose.

It was sold by Andrew Boys, a direct descendent of the original owner's brother, who was left it in a family member's will. After years of being stored in the attic of his home, Mr Boys decided to sell it.

The cast is classed as the most significant example of its kind remaining in private hands. All but one of the other examples are in national collections in France.

Andrew Boys said for years he did not know what to do the cast, adding: ‘At a family funeral I was rather surprised and taken aback, to hear that I had been left this mask.

‘After a while I realised its 
significance but I was not sure what to do with it beyond ensuring its 
safety.  To date it has been confined to an attic but I most definitely 
did not want this to happen for another generation.

‘I came to the conclusion that the 
best thing to do was to offer it for sale in the hope that, as a result,
 it was something more people would then be able to see and enjoy’.

After
 Napoleon's death, there was a protracted wrangle over whether his 
physician, Francesco Antommarchi, or the British doctor, Francis Burton,
 should make a death mask.

Practical difficulties also meant this was not done until two days after the former Emperor had died.

The mask was given to Rev Boys by the 
portrait painter, J.W. Rubidge, who helped Mr Antommarchi to make the 
mask. Rev Boys received it before Napoleon's entourage left the island.

Napoleon Bonaparte, who was exiled to Elba, Italy, after defeat in 1814, escaped and returned to France before being beaten again at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and imprisoned by the British on St Helena.

He was supported by South America, which was backed by him when it was trying to gain independence from Spain, and had ambitions of a new empire in Mexico or Venezuela.

But Napoleon was one on the most closely guarded prisoners of all time, with a strong Royal Navy squadron of 11 ships patrolling the South Atlantic island where he was kept 1,200 miles from the nearest land.

Plots to rescue him included those using yachts, steamboats and balloons - and one was said to have even involved a submarine.

The escape plans were hatched despite Napoleon being confined to an astonishingly secure prison for the era, which was guarded by 2,800 men and 500 cannon on its handful of possible landing ports.

He spent six years on the heavily-guarded island, in the refurbished Longwood mansion, where visitors were thoroughly questioned and searched, before dying in May 1821, apparently of cancer.

It is inscribed 'Rev Mr Boys' on the inside of the cast - and comes with a note by Boys, reading: ‘This Cast was taken from the Face of Napoleon Buonaparte as he lay dead at Longwood St. Helena 7th May 1821 which I do hereby certify/ R. Boys M.A. Sen.r Chaplain/ By Rubidge.’

Revd Boys is recorded as having played chess with Napoleon and is said to have brought several mementos of the Frenchman with him on his return to England eight years later. He was a strict moralist who made himself unpopular by preaching sermons against the loose living of senior members of the British garrison.

As a result he was said to have been viewed as something of a liability by the British authorities and well-regarded by the French contingent on the Island. This may explain why he managed to get hold of such an intimate memento of the Emperor as this impression of his death mask.

Bonhams spokesman Matthew Haley said: ‘This mask is a fascinating reflection on the nature of power and its projection.

‘By the time the cast for the mask was made Napoleon's body had begun to decompose in the fierce heat and, as was noted at the time, his features had changed quite markedly.

‘The very last image we have of Napoleon, therefore, is more that of a saint than the man of action and resolution carefully engineered in the portraits painted during his lifetime.'

Bonhams consultant Felix Pryor added: ‘Before the invention of photography, taking a cast from a person's face was the one way of producing what may be described as an objective likeness. These masks were most often taken after death.

'In this they became part of the funerary rites of the dead, the royal dead especially - royal death masks can be traced back to at least the time of Tutankhamun.

‘The present death mask of Napoleon can be seen as standing at the end of this long tradition - the world's first photograph was to be taken only five years later’.
