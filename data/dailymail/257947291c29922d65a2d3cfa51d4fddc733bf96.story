The number of children in Britain who have been snatched has increased with almost 900 youngsters taken by strangers or their parents in the last year, a new report reveals.

Figures gathered by police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the charity Parents and Abducted Children Together (Pact) show that child kidnappings have increased by almost a fifth.

During 2013-14, kidnappings and abductions of children under 18 rose by 13 per cent since the previous year.

Five-year-old April Jones, who was abducted after being seen getting into a car near her home in Wales in October 2012. Mark Bridger, 46, was later found guilty of abduction and murder 

Kidnappings alone, which are defined as using force or fraud to remove a child, increased at a faster rate, rising by 18 per cent over the same period.

Most abductions, 401 out of 559, were carried out by people other than the children's parents, while 321 were kidnapped.

The number of children being abducted by parents was 158, up by six per cent on the previous year.

And the charity believe the increase in numbers since 2012-13 could be down to a different attitude in recording such crimes in the light of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal.

Pact's director of research Geoff Newiss said: 'I would imagine that (Rotherham) is something to do with it.

'I wouldn't be surprised if forces are more sensitive now to the need to record what comes their way.' 

The highest rate of child abduction and kidnap was in Northern Ireland, with 11.6 offences per 100,00 children in the last year.

Meanwhile the lowest was in Wales where there were 4.5 offences per 100,000 children.

The largest forces such as the Metropolitan Police recorded the highest number of cases, while kidnapping and abduction offences in Lancashire doubled and there were also significant increases in Kent, North Yorkshire and Northumbria.

Mr Newiss added: 'Our analysis shows quite alarming rises in child abduction and kidnapping over the last two years.

'However, it's difficult to say whether this is a consequence of victims being more likely to report crime, changes in the way police record it, or a genuine increase in offending.

'It is important to stress that child abduction or kidnapping is relatively rare. 

'However, we know that many incidents go unreported to, or unrecorded by, the police.'

While Susannah Drury, Director of Policy for Missing People, said: 'The report has uncovered worrying increases in child abductions and kidnapping offences - highlighting the importance of a quick and effective national response to these crimes. '

The Association of Chief Police Officers say there has been a significant increase in the recording of these kinds of crimes due to a 'considerable focus' on improving crime-recording practices.
