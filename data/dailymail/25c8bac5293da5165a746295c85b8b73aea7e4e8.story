Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has admitted becoming a more 'autocratic' manager because of the club's Champions League campaign.

Rodgers and Liverpool face a make-or-break encounter with Basle on Tuesday, which echoes their famous 2004/05 win against Olympiakos which took the club through to the knockout stages and on the road to later glory in Istanbul.

The congested fixture list caused by Liverpool's European games has prevented Rodgers from properly bedding in his nine new summer signings and forced him to change approach after a 3-1 defeat against Crystal Palace on November 22 left the club in 12th place.

Brendan Rodgers says he has had to be more 'autotratic' this season as Liverpool manager

Real Madrid are winners and Liverpool must beat Basel to take second spot.

For the following match in Ludogorets, which Liverpool drew 2-2 to set up the showdown with Basle, Rodgers returned to basics by leaving out new signings Emre Can, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Lazar Markovic, and says he's been far more direct with instructions to his players.

'I have had a lot less time on the training field this year. The problem I have had personally is you can’t try things, you can’t coach,' said Rodgers.

'That is alright if I'd had two years working with the same group and only added a couple of new players. But I've had nine new players and no coaching time.

'When I first came to Liverpool, I put my principles in place; this is the way I work.

'Once I was bedded in and people understood, I became a little more democratic, more educational. But after Palace, I’m thinking “Right, I need to become autocratic again.”

'I've provided even more clarity, been more concise in the ways of working.

'Ultimately, it’s about winning and after Crystal Palace I needed to look because we were nowhere near our level our standard. So I had to find the solution to win games.'

Liverpool have lost three of their five Champions League group games so far – two of them to holders Real Madrid – but will progress into the last-16 if they beat Basle by a scoreline that will give them a better head-to-head record than the Swiss side, won their first game 1-0.

The situation is strikingly similar to the Olympiakos game which took place exactly 10 years ago on Monday and has gone down in Anfield folklore.

Liverpool needed to score three goals to progress after Brazilian legend Rivaldo had given the Greek side a half-time lead.

But roared on by The Kop, unsung heroes Florent Sinama-Pongolle and Neil Mellor scored for Liverpool before Steve Gerrard scored a stunning “winner” after 86 minutes.

Five months later, Liverpool were winning the trophy itself for the fifth time after an incredible comeback against AC Milan and Rodgers hopes the remarkable season can be an omen.

'It is a tough competition. But as we have seen over the years, it is not always the best team that can go on and do well in it,' said Rodgers.

'Our only concentration is to get out of the group. If we can do that, we will be better later on.

'We know what happened against Olympiakos. They went on and won it that year, having just about qualified. I am really looking forward to the atmosphere on Tuesday night.'
