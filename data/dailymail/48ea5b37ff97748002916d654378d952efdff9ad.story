It was a lap of honour with a difference.

But when Natasha Baker took a ride around Greenwich Park on her personalised mobility scooter today, the cheers from the crowd confirmed that she had made sporting history.

The dressage rider had just broken a Paralympic record to win gold for Great Britain in the Grade II freestyle class on her horse Cabral.

It was the 22-year-old's second gold medal - and second Paralympic record - in only 48 hours.

Baker, who suffers from an inflammation of the spine, won an individual championship title for ParalympicsGB two days ago.

Today's
success was the British para-equestrian team's seventh medal of the 
Games, which leaves them needing three more from four remaining events 
to equal their record haul at Beijing in 2008.

Reflecting on her double success, Baker said: 'It feels amazing.

'I never imagined that at my first Games in London I would go home with two gold medals.

'It's incredible. I don't know what to say to be honest, and that doesn't happen a lot.

'Cabral is just a star. I couldn't have asked for any more from him. Today's test was the best of all three we have done here.'

Baker revealed that her routine in the event - during which horses move in time to music - had not gone entirely to plan.

'I was so far behind my music at one point that I had to completely improvise with my whole trot,' she said.

'The canter was spot-on until I did my change in the middle, but I think it actually looked quite artistically good.

'There was no need to panic. If I panic, Cabral panics.'

One thing that did not change, however, was Baker's recently acquired Paralympics superstition - a McDonalds takeaway the night before she competes.

'I have loads of superstitions,' she added. 'I had a McDonalds on opening ceremony night, which was a bit cheeky, and it was before my first day of competing.

'It went so well on the first day that I have had one each other night before I competed, and it was the same meal each time - chicken mayo.'

Baker, from Uxbridge, West London, will be honoured with a special stamp to mark her second win in the Paralympic Games.

It is the first time that a set of stamps has been issued to celebrate Paralympic gold medallists from the host country.

The
stamps will go on sale at more than 500 post offices around the UK 
tomorrow. Uxbridge residents will be able to buy them at the post office
in nearby Hayes.

Baker is the third member of ParalympicsGB to appear on two gold medal stamps.

The
others are cyclist Sarah Storey, who won gold in the women's C4/5 500m 
time-trial and 3km individual pursuit, and horse rider Sophie 
Christiansen, who triumphed in the single Grade 1A and team dressage events.

Dressage
rider Charlotte Dujardin, who won two gold medals for Team GB at the 
Olympics, led the tributes to Baker after her second victory.

'What
an amazing result! I hope she enjoys every minute of it,' Dujardin 
said. 'She is such a fantastic rider, and I admire her for what she can 
do.

'She certainly doesn't let her disability stand in her way.

'It is brilliant. My tummy felt like it did when I won. I am so excited for her.'

Record-breaker: Baker competes in the event on her horse Cabral. She was awarded a Paralympic high score of 82.800%
