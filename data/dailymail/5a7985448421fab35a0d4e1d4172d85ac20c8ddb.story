Hillary Clinton has revealed the U.S. has 'serious concerns' about how Russia's parliamentary elections were run - after European monitors revealed the vote was heavily stacked in favour of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's party.

The U.S. Secretary of State launched the attack following reports the poll was marked 'by the convergence of the state and Putin's United Russia party' - and amid allegations of ballot box stuffing.

She said, during an Afghanistan summit in Bonn, Germany, that her opinion mattered less than that of Russian voters, whom she said deserved the right to know their votes were fairly cast and counted.

But she added: 'Russian voters deserve a full investigation of all credible reports of electoral fraud and manipulation and we hope in particular that then Russian authorities will take action on reports that come forward.

'The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. That means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.'

And she said Washington was also concerned that internal Russian election monitors were harassed, including by cyber attacks on their web sites.

Preliminary results released this morning show the man who has steadily tightened his grip on the nation for nearly 12 years had suffered a humiliating setback.

Putin's party has seen its majority in Russia's parliament weaken sharply - despite European monitors also highlighting limited political competition and a lack of fairness.

And they said it was tainted by frequent procedural violations and instances of apparent manipulations, including serious indications of ballot box stuffing.

'To me, this election was like a game in which only some players are allowed to compete,' head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe Heidi Tagliavini said.

United Russia is still expected to retain its majority in the lower house and Putin is all but certain to win next March's presidential election, but yesterday's vote has badly dented his carefully groomed image.

Russia results

It reflected a strong public frustration with the lack of political competition, ubiquitous official corruption and the gap between rich and poor, which will pose a growing challenge to Putin's power.

With about 96 per cent of precincts counted, United Russia was leading with 49.5 per cent of the vote, Central Election Commission chief Vladimir Churov said.

He predicted that it will get 238 of the Duma's 450 seats, a sharp drop compared to the previous vote that landed the party a two-thirds majority in the State Duma, allowing it to change the constitution.

Critics said that even that United Russia performance is strongly inflated, pointing at numerous reports of ballot-stuffing and other violations.

The nation's only independent election 
watchdog has been subjected to a massive official intimidation campaign 
in the week before the vote and saw its website blocked by what it 
described as a massive cyber attack it blamed on authorities.

United
Russia has been seen increasingly as the party of corrupt officials, 
and its description as a 'party of crooks and thieves' has stuck, 
flashing up as the first suggestion on Russia's top web search engine.

Putin
sought to stem a quick decline in United Russia's popularity by trying 
to expand its support base with a so-called Popular Front, an umbrella 
group for unions, professional associations, veteran groups and others.

But
the effort has brought no visible result, and Putin last month received
a stinging blow to his own ego when he was met with catcalls after a 
mixed martial arts fight at a Moscow arena.

Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov said after the vote that Putin's 'honeymoon' with the nation was over.

'He needs to hold an honest 
presidential election and allow opposition candidates to register for 
the race, if he doesn't want to be booed from Kamchatka to Kaliningrad,'
Nemtsov said on Ekho Moskvy radio.

Seeing
the declining fortunes of his party, Putin named his handpicked 
successor as president, Dmitry Medvedev, to lead United Russia's list.

The
vote will further weaken positions of Medvedev, whom Putin promised to 
name prime minister after the presidential vote, a move that has fuelled 
public irritation.

Putting a positive spin on the 
disappointing returns, Putin said late Sunday that 'we can ensure the 
stable development of the country with this result.'

But he appeared glum when speaking to supporters at United Russia headquarters and limited his remarks to a terse statement.

The
Communist Party appeared to benefit most from the protest vote, with 
exit polls and the early returns predicting it would get nearly 20 per 
cent, up from less than 12 per cent four years ago.

The socialist Just Russia and the 
Liberal Democratic Party led by mercurial nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky are also expected to increase their representation in the 
Duma.

Just 20 years ago, they seemed consigned to the dustbin of history - but Russia's communists are enjoying a new found resurgence.

Students, intellectuals, and even some businessmen voted for the Community Party (CPRF) in a bid to wound Vladimir Putin's United Russia.

The party, which to some may still evoke memories of elderly poor left behind a New Russia of glitzy indulgence, doubled its vote to about 20 per cent.

For many Russians disillusioned by rampant corruption and a widening gap between rich and poor, the communists represented the only credible opposition.

Through all the turmoil of the early 1990s when the Soviet Union collapsed, the party kept a strong national organisation based on regions and workplace.

With access to official media limited for the opposition, it has had a huge advantage.     

'The Communists are the only real party out there,' said one Western banker in Moscow.

'United Russia is a joke, Just Russia is a joke and the LDPR is a joke and many people know it. So they vote communist because they realize it is a real vote for the opposition and against United Russia. This is as ironic as you get.'

Perceptions among some Russians that the nationalist LDPR party and Just Russia are in the Kremlin's pocket and will vote with United Russia in parliament also helped the communists.

Despite that, Putin should still have no problem getting his laws rubber-stamped.

Even
the Communists have posed only token opposition in the outgoing Duma, 
and the two other parties have consistently voted with United Russia.

About 60 per cent of Russia's 110 million registered voters cast ballots, down from 64 percent four years ago.

Only
seven parties were allowed to field candidates for parliament this 
year, while the most vocal opposition groups were barred.

Several parties complained Sunday of extensive election violations aimed at boosting United Russia's results.

Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov 
said his party monitors thwarted an attempt to stuff a ballot box at a 
Moscow polling station where they found 300 ballots already in the box 
before the start of the vote and pointed at numerous other incidents of 
ballot-stuffing.

Russia's
only independent election monitoring group, Golos, which is funded by 
U.S. and European grants, has come under heavy official pressure in the 
past week after Putin accused Western governments of trying to influence
the election and likened recipients of Western aid to Judas.

Golos
website was incapacitated by hackers on Sunday, but it was still able 
to field more than 2,000 observers, and they reported numerous 
violations, director Liliya Shibanova said.

She
said many of the violations involved absentee ballots, including 
so-called 'cruise' or 'carousel' voting where people with the ballots 
are bussed to multiple polling stations.

Many people complained that they were forced to get absentee ballots and hand them over to their bosses.

Social
media were flooded with messages reporting violations. Many people 
reported seeing buses deliver groups of people to polling stations, with
some of the buses carrying young men who looked like football fans.
