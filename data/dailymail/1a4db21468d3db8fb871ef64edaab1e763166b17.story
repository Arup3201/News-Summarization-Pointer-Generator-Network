Queens Park Rangers have unveiled the release of their new home, away and third kits ahead of the 2014-15 Premier League campaign.

Manufactured by Nike, Rangers' trio Joey Barton, Nedum Onuoha and Charlie Austin were the three players selected to model the new strips alongside goalkeeper Rob Green at an event in London.

The Loftus Road outfit secured promotion back to England's top flight courtesy of Bobby Zamora's dramatic injury time winner against Derby County in their Championship play-off final on Saturday.

New look: Queens Park Rangers have unveiled their new kits for next season manufactured by Nike

Jumping for joy: The home kit features the classic royal blue and white-hooped design on the jersey

Heyday: QPR's away kit pays homage to the club's sixties and seventies look with it's red and black design

The 1-0 Wembley win means Harry Redknapp's side will showcase their new look against the likes of champions Manchester City, Liverpool and local rivals Chelsea.

Modelled by Barton, who Redknapp believes has what it takes to succeed as future manager, the home kit features the classic royal blue and white-hooped design on the jersey, along with all-white shorts and socks.

Queens Park's away kit pays homage to the club's sixties and seventies look with a bold red and black striped design accompanied by black shorts and socks.

The elegant and modern third kit comes in an all-white design, harping back to the kit worn in by the R's League Cup triumph of 1967.

QPR's five-year partnership with the American manufacturers will see Nike provide apparel, training kit and equipment for the R’s until at least May 2019.

Speaking exclusively to www.qpr.co.uk, QPR CEO, Philip Beard, commented: 'We’re proud not only to be making our return to the Premier League, but also to be associated with the leading global brand in football.'

'We look forward to enjoying a long and successful partnership with Nike.'
