He's a billionaire mining baron with designs on the Australian premiership, and businessman Clive Palmer showed he is willing to do anything to win the young vote - even twerking.

While most would-be Prime Ministers try and assert their policies and attempt to emulate the manner of a great world leaders, eccentric Palmer United Party Mr Palmer, 59, looked more like politics' answer to Miley Cyrus during a radio interview.

The mogul treated Sydney radio hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O to his own unique rendition of the suggestive dance made famous by The Climb singer when he appeared on their 2Day FM show.

Despite warning the hosts that he wouldn't be able to 'get down too low', larger than life Mr Palmer was happy to perform the dance once it was demonstrated to him by Mr Sandilands.

Egged on by the hosts, Mr Palmer grinned as he hung on to the studio desk, crouched down, gyrated his hips and shook his derriere.

As he returned to his feet, Mr Palmer joked: 'If you can't twerk, you can't be Prime Minister.'

The dance style, known as twerking, requires a lot of rump shaking and squatting, and was made famous after a video of American singer Miss Cyrus performing the move during a radio interview earlier this year went viral.

Would-be Prime Minister Mr Palmer is well-known for his flamboyant nature.

Earlier this year, he revealed that he has contracted a Chinese firm to build an exact replica of the ill-fated Titanic, which sunk in April 1912 killing around 1,500 passengers and crew.

Like the original vessel, the Titanic II will have nine decks, 840 rooms and retain its first, second and third class divisions.

The 270metre-long, 40,000 tonne ship will sail its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York - the same intended route of the the original - in 2016, according to Mr Palmer.

He also made headlines earlier this year when he ordered more than 100 mechanical dinosaurs for his Palmer Coolum Resort on Australia's Sunshine Coast, in a bid to recreate his own version of Jurassic Park.

The owner of Mineralogy, BRW magazine reported he was Australia's fifth-richest person last year with an estimated fortune of more than AUS$5billion (Â£3.2billion).

Mr Palmer is not the only Australian MP to mix politics and popular culture.

Earlier this year, Kevin Rudd, Tony Abbott and Christine Milne appeared in a music video for indie punk band Super Best Friends.
