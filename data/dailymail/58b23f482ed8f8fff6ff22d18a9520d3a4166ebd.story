Barack Obama offered more support for global financial system protesters after a weekend of demonstrations across the world.

Speaking at the dedication of a new memorial to Martin Luther King on National Mall, Washington, the U.S. President called on protesters not to 'demonise' Wall Street workers.

He said: 'Dr King would want us to challenge the excesses of Wall Street without demonising those who work there.'

It comes after several hundred protesters were arrested in at least seven U.S. cities over the weekend supporting the growing Occupy Wall Street movement.

The arrests were largely peaceful, but were made after demonstrators refused to obey police orders to leave public areas.

They included 175 people detained at a park in Chicago, as well as at protests in Washington DC; New York; Fairbanks, Alaska; Bulington, Vermont; Rapid City, South Dakota, Tucson, Arizona, Phoenix and Cheyenne, Wyoming.

In Rome, the protests turned violent after rioter hijacked a peaceful gathering and smashed windows, tore up pavements and torched vehicles.

An estimated $1.4million of damage was caused to the Italian capital.

The Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives, Eric Cantor, originally compared the protests to 'angry mobs'.

But he told Fox News yesterday that Republicans agreed there was 'too much' income disparity in the U.S.

'More important than my use of the word [mobs] is that there is a growing frustration out there across the country and it is warranted,' he said.

'Too many people are out of work.'

Among those arrested in Washington DC was civil rights activist and Princeton University professor Cornel West, who was detained on the steps of the Supreme Court protesting about corporate influence in politics.

In Canada, demonstrators gathered from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Vancouver, British Columbia, with hundreds protesting in the heart of Toronto's financial district.

Mr Obama is expected to use public anger at Wall Street excess to turn up the heat on congressional Republicans as he tries to gain support for his stalled jobs bill.

He will head to North Carolina and Virginia over the next three days - both vital to his 2012 reelection chances - in visits aimed at winning passage for parts of the $447billion jobs plan.

Spokesman Josh Earnest said: 'The president will continue to acknowledge the frustration that he himself shares about the need for Washington to do more to support our economic recovery and to ensure that the interest of the 99 per cent of Americans is well-represented.'

Mr Obama's strategy is to force Republicans to give ground or be painted as obstructionists more interested in shielding 'millionaires and billionaires' - the '1 per cent' used by the protesters - from paying their fair share of tax.
