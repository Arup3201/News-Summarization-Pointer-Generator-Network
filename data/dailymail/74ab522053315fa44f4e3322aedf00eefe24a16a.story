Pippa wore £124.99 Superdry beige coat to visit sister Kate in hospital yesterday

Tulisa, Nicole Scherzinger and David Beckham also fans

Ever since she stepped out in the figure hugging white bridesmaid's dress and showcased her phenomenal derriere at the Royal Wedding, Pippa Middleton has become somewhat of a style icon.

Since her royal debut, she has topped best dressed lists worldwide and was even given a nod in TIME's top 100 most influential people.

But despite having millionaire parents 
and royal relations, just like the Duchess of Cambridge, Pippa is a champion of the high street as proven by her recent outfit choice whilst visiting her sister in hospital.

Royal seal of approval: Pippa Middleton wore her beige Superdry coat whilst visiting her sister Kate in hospital yesterday

Pippa was spotted in a beige, belted Superdry coat during her visit to the hospital with brother James yesterday afternoon.

Fashion fans were so desperate to emulate her style that the £124.99 classic mac went on to sell out online overnight.

And it seems that Pippa isn't the brand's only famous fan. Both Tulisa and Nicole Scherzinger gave the brand some X Factor when they stepped out in it in recent weeks and even boy band Union J looked dapper in Superdry suits on the show.

Tulisa, known for her urban style, was spotted in a classic white Superdry hoody while glamorous Nicole opted for a checked skirt by the brand.

Fashion savvy pregnant Fearne Cotton is also a huge fan and wrapped up warm in their tassel cardigan whilst out and about in London, an item also favoured by The Only Way is Essex's Lydia Bright.

Pippa's beige coat is still available in stores and a black version online.

When David Beckham stepped out in a Brad
 leather jacket by Superdry, it sold 70,000 from 2007 to mid-2009, becoming a 
best-seller for the company.

Although Pippa's beige mac is no longer listed on Superdry's website, a similar 
version - the vintage city mac- is priced at £139.99.

And it isn't the first time that Pippa has sported the brand, she wore a pair of their vibrant pink jeans back in January which she teamed with ankle boots, checked shirt and classic black blazer.

Flew off the online rails: While Pippa's coat is sold out on the website, a black version retails for £139.99

Superdry is owned by SuperGroup which was established by Julian Dunkerton as 'Cult Clothing' in Cheltenham back in 1985.

Superdry's distinctive designs, which combine Americana with 
Japanese-style graphics and British tailored fits, have led some to 
believe we're a Japanese clothing label.

But although the Superdry 
graphics may look Japanese, the label's origins are very much 
home-grown.

The first Superdry store opened in Covent Garden in London in 2004.

The business enetered the London Stock Exchange in 2010 and owner Dunkerton was featured on the Sunday Times Rich List in 2012, said to be worth an estimated £180m.

2012 wasn't a good year for the brand, which issued profit warnings with store opening under review in February.

Winter warmers: The cold weather has boosted Superdry sales

However, the recent cold snap has boosted 
sales of hoodies, jackets and warm winter clothing at rapidly expanding 
fashion chain SuperGroup.

Chief executive
 Julian Dunkerton credited the weather and benefits of a new team, who 
had just ‘bedded in’, for the 3.9 per cent rise in underlying sales for 
the 26 weeks to October 28.

The entrepreneurial boss sounded a 
cautious note about future trading saying: ‘Whilst mindful of a 
competitive Christmas trading season ahead, the group is on track to 
deliver a profit figure in-line with market expectations for the full 
year.

Whilst I am pleased with the progress that the new team is making 
there remains much to do.’
