Former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover feared Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. so much he sent the civil rights leader an anonymous letter urging him to commit suicide, it has emerged.

A new book has chronicled how the FBI under Hoover classified King as 'the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country' and went to extreme lengths - including breaking in and bugging his home, office and hotel rooms - to destroy him and his work to bring about racial equality.

After delivering his 'I Have A Dream Speech' at the 1963 March on Washington, the government's interest in the leader intensified and Hoover allocated significant resources to monitoring King's movements and eavesdropping on his conversations, according to 'The Burglary: the Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret FBI.'

The FBI was apparently looking for a communist party connection - which is how they got permission from Attorney General Robert Kennedy - however the only information they garnered was about the reverend’s extramarital affairs.

When Hoover learned King would be the recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, he stepped up his attack, instructing his agents to send King an anonymous note in which they threatened to divulge details about his affairs if he didn't take his own life.

'King, look into your heart. You know you are a complete fraud and a great liability to all of us Negroes,' the nasty note read.

'You are no clergyman and you know it. I repeat you are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that. You could not believe in God... Clearly you don't believe in any personal moral principles.'

It then went on: 'King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is.... You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation.'

The agents told him he had just 34 days in which to 'do it.'

In the book, journalist and author Betty Medsger details Hoover's intense loathing of King and his overzealous violation of the reverend’s privacy.

'Hoover's attitude toward King can be described as a nearly savage hatred... The plot involved office break-ins, use of informers, mail opening, wiretapping, and bugging of King's office, home, and hotel rooms,' she writes.

This almost fanatical obsession with King is disclosed in tens of thousands of FBI memos from the 1960s. The Bureau itself said the investigation was 'aimed at neutralizing King as an effective Negro leader.'

Not only was the leader tracked incessantly but his associates were watched closely also.

But Hoover's particular contempt for King is also clear in the memos the FBI boss kept in his personal files.

According to CNN, he would scrawl things like 'this is disgusting' and 'astounding' across the bottom of positive news stories about King's success.
