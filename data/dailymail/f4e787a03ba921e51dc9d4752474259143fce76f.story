Two thieves were caught red-handed when a schoolgirl called police from under a bed when they broke into her home.

Marcus Speirs, 32, and Richard Ansah, 29, broke in to the home in Erdington, Birmingham, by breaking down a back door. They then began searching the property for valuables.

But the burglars hadn't realised a 13-year-old girl and her brother, nine, had run upstairs and grabbed a phone.

The quick-thinking teenager, who was alone in the house with her younger brother, hid under a bed and dialled 999 before Speirs spotted the siblings. When he did he threatened them with a garden hoe.

Police officers arrived at the family home within four minutes of the emergency call and arrested the pair.

Speirs, from Hockley, Birmingham, was charged with aggravated burglary whilst Ansah, from Sutton Coldfield, West Mids., was charged with burglary.

The pair were sentenced to nine years and four years in prison respectively at Birmingham Crown Court on December 20 after admitting the charges.

Speaking after the hearing, West Midlands Police Detective Sergeant Mark Langley, said: 'The young girl showed extreme courage and, crucially, had the awareness to grab a phone and take cover whilst dialling 999.

'She remained calm throughout what was undoubtedly a terrifying incident and was able to clearly and accurately relay details to a police call handler.

'The girl's textbook actions meant we were able to get officers to the scene within four minutes and catch both men in the act.

'These are two dangerous offenders - men who put young children through a shocking ordeal - and they have rightly been handed lengthy terms behind bars.'

Case: The duo were jailed at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) for a total of 13 years for the crime

The two thieves - one of whom was armed with a metal bar - broke into the address just before 6.30pm on May 7 last year.

The court heard Speirs was the main aggressor who snatched the phone from the 13-year-old girl and threatened her with the garden hoe.

He was later found with the handset when searched in police custody.

Det Sgt Langley, added: 'The evidence against both men was overwhelming and they pleaded guilty at an early stage.

'It meant neither child needed to give evidence - but had they been required to we have special measures in place to assist vulnerable witnesses when giving evidence and officers on hand to guide them through the process.'
