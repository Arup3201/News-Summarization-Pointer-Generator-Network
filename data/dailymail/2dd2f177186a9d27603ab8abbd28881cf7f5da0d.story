Arsenal’s Champions League play off first leg against Besiktas will be refereed by a Serbian official accused of showing bias at the World Cup.

Milorad Mazic takes charge of the Gunners’ tough trip to Istanbul – and fans will be worried about the his ability to take charge of a game in such an intense and high pressure atmosphere after taking flak from two international managers at this summer’s tournament in Brazil.

Portugal coach Paulo Bento said that Mazic ‘showed bias’ in his side’s 4-0 defeat by Germany and Iran’s Carlos Queiroz judged the referee to not to be of the right ‘level’ to match the occasion in their 1-0 loss to Argentina.

Mazic was subsequently demoted to be a fourth official for the remainder of the tournament – but is back in action for Arsenal trip to take on Besiktas at the 76,000-seater Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul on Tuesday.

‘In these 90 minutes, we competed to honour the game,’ Queiroz said after the Iran-Argentina tie. ‘But the referee was not on the same level. I’m sorry to say that.

‘There’s nothing that can explain (why) this Serbian referee (did) not give the penalty. How can this guy sleep tonight, or for the rest of his life?’

Bento was also unhappy with Mazic’s ability. ‘There were two occasions when the referee showed bias, first with the penalty and then with the sending off,’ he said.

Mazic was also in charge of Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last season. He has been a FIFA referee since 2009 and has been quoted as having the motto: ‘You can’t please everyone.’

The intimidating atmosphere in istanbul will be nothing new for Mazic, however, who is used to taking charge of the highly-charged Belgrade derby between Red Star and Partizan back in Serbia.
