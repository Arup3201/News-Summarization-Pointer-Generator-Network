Gary Neville believes the stage is set for Eden Hazard to become a 'true world class player' as the winger looks to propel Chelsea to the Premier League title.

Hazard scoring his first goal of the season against Leicester on Saturday and has looked lively during Chelsea's opening two games.

The 23-year-old was Chelsea's top scorer last season with 17 goals in all competitions and Neville believes no is the time for Hazard to step up a gear.

In the groove: The 23-year-old fires Chelsea into a 2-0 lead against Leicester on Saturday

Speaking on Sky Sports Monday Night Football, Neville said: 'We've always demanded more from Hazard, we always feel like there's another level for him to go up. 

'This could be the season for Hazard, where he becomes a true world class player. Where he takes the stage every week and consistently dominates.'

The arrival of £32million striker Diego Costa looks to have taken a weight of Hazard's shoulders with two goals in as many games for Chelsea so far this season.

Ready: Speaking on Sky Sports Monday Night Football, Neville claimed 'this could be the season for Hazard' 

Jose Mourinho often had to rely on the magic of Hazard last season as a strikeforce of Fernando Torres, Samuel Eto'o and Demba Ba failed to produce.

Former Manchester United defender Neville claimed that Costa looks to be just what the Blues needed for a successful Premier League campaign. 

Neville added: 'He's (Costa) doing exactly what you thought he would, scoring ugly goals, important goals, one that put his team in front.'
