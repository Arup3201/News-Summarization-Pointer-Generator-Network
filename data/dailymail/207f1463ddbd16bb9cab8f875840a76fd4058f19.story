David Beckham has thrown his backing behind under-pressure Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti ahead of a crucial El Clasico against Barcelona, listing the Italian coach as one of the best bosses he has played under.

Real go into Sunday's showdown a point behind their fierce rivals from Catalonia, and talk has even surfaced that Ancelotti could lose his job should they fall further behind in the title race.

A difficult year for the European champions saw them surrender the title lead to Barcelona and then struggle to make it through to the Champions League quarter-finals with a tight win over Schalke.

The Real boss goes into Sunday's El Clasico a point behind Barcelona and his position has been questioned

But despite their struggles, former Real midfielder Beckham believes Ancelotti remains the right man for the job after leading Los Blancos to their 10th Champions League win just 10 months ago.

'Is he the right man for the job? For me he is,' Beckham told AS. 'Because he knows how to get respect out of the players, he knows how to get the best out of the players – and the players respect him, as does everybody in the football world.

Beckham labelled Ancelotti as one of the best managers he has worked under after their time at PSG

Ancelotti and Beckham had previously paired up during the England midfielder's loan spell with AC Milan

'I love Carlo, he's one of the best people I've ever spent time with, one of the best managers I've ever been managed by. He's a manager who has humility, he has so much passion for the game, he's a winner, he's always been successful wherever he has gone and for me, he's not just one of the nicest people in the world but also one of the best managers I have ever played under.

'To see the success he has already had at Real Madrid for me is incredible and not surprising. I look at him as a person and as a manager – as a person, you can't get any better and as a manager, the same. He's one of the best.'

Ancelotti lifts the European Cup at the end of last season, but Real have struggled to match expectations
