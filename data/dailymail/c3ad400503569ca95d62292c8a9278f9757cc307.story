At  the end the scoreboard said the difference was only three points. In reality, the gulf in class between these two teams was seismic.

England huffed, puffed and attempted to blow down the New Zealand wall but ultimately the world champions had too much nous, too much power and too much quality.

And in Richie McCaw they had one of the greatest players ever to have picked up a rugby ball. The 33-year-old open side won his head-to-head with England captain Chris Robshaw by a distance and showed yet again the value of having a genuine scavenging No 7 in the pack.

England simply had no answer.

In truth, New Zealand could have won this game by 15 points as they dominated the second half after England had given the record 82,223 crowd hope with a high-octane display to lead 14-11 at the break.

But, with McCaw — one of three New Zealand try scorers — playing so low to the ground he was practically in it, the All Blacks won the all-important breakdown battle and with it the match.

Once or twice the All Black skipper, winning his 135th cap, fell foul of referee Nigel Owens. But more often than not his hands did enough to slow down England’s ball or turn it over.

One piece of second-half larceny following a charge by Billy Vunipola enabled fly half Aaron Cruden to scuttle up-field before punting the ball away for a gain of fully 80 metres.

Even with hooker Dane Coles in the sin bin following a petulant kick at opposite man Dylan Hartley, the All Blacks continued to play with calm authority. Almost every decision they took in the second half proved correct.

By contrast, England kicked poorly and failed to gain the territory they craved. With the industrious Kyle Eastmond at inside centre, England lacked a second kicking option alongside Owen Farrell.

Well as Eastmond played in marshalling the hulking Sonny Bill Williams, England will surely consider playing Farrell at 12 alongside George Ford next week against South Africa.

Coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘The weather turned and New Zealand maximised that opportunity well. When the hooker was in the sin bin they managed that opportunity well, too.

‘We couldn’t get enough territory in the second half to get close. But we don’t think we’re too far away.

‘We had New Zealand on the ropes but we didn’t finish them off.’

England will put a brave face on this. They have to because they still have three QBE internationals to play this autumn.

But there will be serious concern about their continued failure to put chances away, despite Jonny May’s wonderful early try, which will live long in the memory.

The Gloucester winger, without a try in his previous seven internationals, received a wonderfully weighted pass from the excellent Brad Barritt and glided past Conrad Smith with astonishing ease before taking the outside line after being offered it by Israel Dagg.

The try, finished from 40 metres, provided hope for a repeat of the stunning triumph over the same opponents two years ago.

But it was not to be. The All Blacks have lost only twice since lifting the Webb Ellis trophy three years ago and dug deep as England blew two gilt-edged chances.

First, May gathered a bouncing ball superbly but failed to spot Owen Farrell on his outside as Dagg made a desperate last-gasp tackle before Mike Brown — normally so reliable — dropped a dipping Eastmond pass with the line at his mercy.

England failed to stick the knife in when they had the chance.

With almost their first foray into England’s half, the visitors crossed when fly half Aaron Cruden touched down. The crowd were incensed that referee Nigel Owens, who endured one of his poorest internationals, declined to go to the Television Match Official. Replays suggested Cruden may have been inches short.

‘We went to the TMO quite a lot of times but not on that occasion, which we probably need to have a chat about at some point,’ said Lancaster.

‘But we’ll focus on our own performance. It was disappointing not to finish off one or two chances.’

The inconsistency in referring to the TMO certainly irritated Lancaster’s opposite number Steve Hansen. He was left fuming at the decision to refer Charlie Faumuina’s 72nd-minute try as replacement fly half Beauden Barrett was lining up the conversion following replays on the big screens.

‘The television producers are starting to have an influence on the game,’ said Hansen.

‘If something goes wrong we see a replay 10 times when the referee, touch judge or TMO hasn’t seen it. It’s not in the spirit of the game. The producers are starting to annoy me.’

England began this game with seven injured British Lions missing and fans have every right to ask serious questions about why a showpiece occasion such as this should be devalued by their absence.

There is a lot of talk about the demands put on England players but not enough action to provide adequate rest periods.

It would be churlish to ignore the positives, however. Dave Attwood — playing because of injury to Joe Launchbury — was outstanding in the second row. New cap George Kruis also impressed after replacing Courtney Lawes when he suffered a nasty head injury 23 minutes into the game.

Fijian-born soldier Semesa Rokoduguni barely put a foot wrong out on the right wing on an occasion charged with pageantry a day before Remembrance Sunday. It was just a shame he didn’t see the ball enough as possession dried up and the rain came down in the second half.

The diminutive Eastmond marshalled Sonny Bill Williams well, while Brad Barritt was almost faultless.

But ultimately, with 11 games left before next year’s World Cup, there appears to be an inescapable gulf in class that looks increasingly hard to bridge.

England have much to ponder.
