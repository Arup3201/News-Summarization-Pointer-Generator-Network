It won't turn brown or shed its needles and you don't have to water it.

But at nearly 30-foot, there are few people who could house this Christmas tree made entirely from Lego.

The plastic evergreen, which contains 350,000 Lego bricks, sprung up in Manchester's Trafford Centre at the beginning of the month.

And you thought your tree was big! A Christmas tree made entirely from Lego bricks has sprouted in Manchester's Trafford Centre

Hard work: Around 350,000 Lego bricks went into the tree's construction

Its 108 branches are adorned with 450
 Lego baubles and twinkling fairy lights. Visitors could also view to a
 Lego Harry Potter figure, who appeared to be guarding the tree.

While this tree seems impressive, it pails in comparison to Lego's offering last Christmas.

In 2011, the toy company constructed a
 40ft-high Christmas tree made from 600,000 Lego bricks at St Pancras 
International in London. It had 172 branches and more than 1,000 
baubles.

Impracticable: At nearly 30 foot, there are few people who could actually house the Christmas tree - they may have to make do with a Lego bauble

Bonus brick: Visitors to the Trafford Centre could also see a Lego Harry Potter (bottom right) who appeared to be guarding the tree
