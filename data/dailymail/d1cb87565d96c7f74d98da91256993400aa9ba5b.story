After a difficult few weeks of infighting, scandals and gaffes, Nigel Farage could be forgiven for seeking a little divine intervention. 

But as the Ukip leader walked through central London this morning he seemed unimpressed by an appearance by Jesus - or at least a very good look-a-like.

To make matters worse, the bizarre stunt happened hours before the party suspended Ukip candidate Winston McKenzie, who this week compared Mr Farage to Christ.

After a difficult few weeks of infighting, scandals and gaffes, Nigel Farage could be forgiven for seeking a little divine intervention

Ukip has had a torrid few weeks, dogged by in-fighting over candidate selection and gaffes by Mr Farage which have seen his personal ratings plummet to a record low.

He failed to see the funny side when confronted by Kevin Lee Light, aka Jesus of Hollywood. 

Mr Farage took a phone call and walked away with aides, after being grilled on live radio about whether a run of bad headlines had lead to a slump in his personal ratings. 

The professional Jesus impersonator, who arrived in the UK from LA this week, appeared in the background of photos in central London.

Winston McKenzie, the party's Commonwealth spokesman, has been stripped of the local role while an investigation is carried out

A senior Ukip figure has been suspended as chairman of the Lambeth and North Croydon branch, the party has confirmed.

Winston McKenzie, the party's Commonwealth spokesman, has been stripped of the local role while an investigation is carried out, a spokesman said.

The former boxer this week compared party leader Nigel Farage to Jesus. 

'Jesus was one man, we're his army. Farage is one man, and we're his army and that's what it's all about,' he said.

'Everywhere he goes, it doesn't matter what he says or does - he gets away with it.'

Ukip declined to say what the investigation will look into but the suspension comes after a letter of no confidence in Mr McKenzie was backed by a number of members, according to the Croydon Advertiser.

A Ukip spokesman said: 'The Lambeth and North Croydon branch of Ukip has been suspended, along with its officers, pending the outcome of an internal inquiry into its activities.

'Winston McKenzie remains our PPC.'

Light has been signed by PR agency Mother to come to Britain, after becoming a minor celebrity in the US. 

Sasha Markova from Mother said: 'We told him who Farage was and he really didn't like it.'

She said every year ad agencies compete to produce the best festive stunt. 'For us, there was something amazing about literally going back to the original idea - just seeing the immediacy of a powerful symbol sent out into the streets and how people are reacting to it.' 

It comes just days after one Ukip candidate compared Mr Farage to Jesus.  

Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie, who is a former professional boxer and has previously courted controversy with remarks about gay adoption, said the party leader can 'do no wrong'.

'Jesus was one man, we're his army. Farage is one man, and we're his army and that's what it's all about,' he said.

'Everywhere he goes, it doesn't matter what he says or does - he gets away with it.'

But it might take some help from the real son of God to turn around Mr Farage's run of bad luck. 

Ukip's general secretary Roger Bird was suspended last week over allegations of behaving inappropriately towards candidate Natasha Bolter, including taking her for dinner and buying her a dress.

She had been a front runner for the seat of South Basildon and East Thurrock, but after pulling out of the race, Kerry Smith was selected.

Mr Smith was then forced to quit this week, after the emergence of taped phone calls in which he mocked a 'f***ing disgusting old poofter' who belongs to a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning group.

Mr Smith also joked about 'shooting peasants', mocked Ukip activist Lucy Bostick for printing 'boring c**p' on her leaflets, and referred to a woman with a Chinese name as a 'Chinky bird'. 

Mr Farage courted controversy last month when he waded into the row over breastfeeding in public, after a mother at the London hotel Claridge's was asked to cover her baby's head with a napkin.

He suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so.

And he was mocked after suggesting traffic jams on the M4 were caused by immigrants.  

A new IpsosMori survey puts net satisfaction with Mr Farage's performance as Ukip leader at its lowest ever level at -20. Only 33 per cent are satisfied and 53 per cent dissatisfied.

This is down from a net score of -6 last month, and down sharply on positive ratings of 11 seen in May last year.

Today Mr Farage questioned the credibility of IpsosMori, adding: 'I know that personal ratings are a fickle thing, and this is a very, very volatile time that we are in.'

However, he conceded: 'We've had a difficult couple of weeks.'

The bizarre confrontation in central London comes just days after one Ukip candidate compared Mr Farage to Jesus.

Taking questions on LBC radio, Mr Farage also insisted he was only joking when he blamed immigrants for a traffic jam on the M4.

The Ukip leader was mocked this month for the bizarre excuse for turning up late to an event where party members had been charged £25 to meet him.

He complained at the time: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.'

But today he denied believing immigration policy affected his traffic flows: 'It was a joke, I've learned something. Never joke. 

'There's no point is there? Nobody has a sense of humour any more so there is no point doing that.'

Sex education policy confusion

Dec 3: Nigel Farge: 'I've never advocated that policy. If somebody in Ukip in the past did, well, so be it, but I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.'  The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.'

Ostentatious breastfeeding 

Dec 5: Nigel Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' 

Immigrants causing traffic jams

Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here... What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.'

General secretary sex scandal 

Dec 8: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter. He claims they slept together, she denies it. Doubts later emerge about her CV, with Oxford denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications  

Rate an immigrant game

Dec 13: A Ukip game asks supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. 

Weeding out the lunatics

Dec 14: Ukip candidates chief David Soutter: 'Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.' 

Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments 

Dec 15: Kerry Smith forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters', joking about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'.
