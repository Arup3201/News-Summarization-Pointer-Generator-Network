More than a third of councils will be putting their tax bills up next week in defiance of calls by the Government for a continued freeze.

In total, 124 councils are increasing their bills – some by nearly 4 per cent.

Many households will be forced to pay up to £50 more on their annual bills, despite the Prime Minister’s insistence that they should not go up.

Government figures show how bills have risen more slowly since the general election, which ministers say amounts to a 9.7 per cent real terms cut

Councils must call a local referendum 
to get the approval of voters if they want to put bills up by more than 2
per cent, under rules set by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.

But the 22 councils that have imposed 
rises greater than 2 per cent have dodged the rules by loading costs on 
to unelected quangos that can set their portion of the tax bill without 
having to face voters.

As a result, these councils do not need to hold a referendum.

In Greater Manchester, for example, 
the waste disposal board has put its council tax demand up by nearly 20 
per cent and the transport authority by nearly 6 per cent.

This means Manchester council has put 
its bills up by 3.9 per cent, nearly double the official cap, and an 
increased burden of more than £50 for a band D council tax payer.

In other areas, fire or police 
authority bills have gone up steeply and led to 2 per cent-plus rises in
council tax bills. This means that across areas including Manchester, 
West Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire and Berkshire, householders will face 
rises of more than £30 and in some cases more than £50 on the benchmark 
band D bills.

Many parish councils, which are also exempt from the 2 per cent rule, have raised their council tax demands.

Yesterday, the Communities Department 
revealed that 41 per cent of billing authorities, including fire and 
police authorities and  council quangos, have ignored the call for a 
freeze.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles offered councils financial help if they froze bills, but only two thirds took it up

The average increase was 0.8 per cent, with an average band D bill coming in at £1,456, compared with £1,444 last year.

Across all council tax bands from A to H, the average household bill will be £1,045.

The increase is the biggest in the 
three years since the Coalition took power. Council tax for 2011-12, its
first year in charge, was frozen across the country. Last year the 
average rise was 0.3 per cent.

But councils have been resisting  
pressure to keep the tax down. They do not like the reward offered by 
the Treasury for freezing it – a one-off grant worth 1 per cent of 
council tax – because it means council tax rises in future years will be
worth less.

Any council which puts up the tax this year will have a higher base on which to impose rises next year.

Yesterday, ministers tried to direct attention to the majority of councils that have frozen the tax.

They claimed that after taking 
inflation into account, the average council tax bill has gone down  in 
real terms by 9.7 per cent since the election of the Coalition in spring
2010.

Mr Pickles said the Government had 
‘worked to freeze council tax for three years, helping hard-working 
families and pensioners with their cost of living’.

But Matthew Sinclair, of the 
TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Rises in council tax are the last thing 
families need after the last decade of hikes in a tax that hits those on
low and moderate incomes the hardest.

‘At a time when household budgets are 
being squeezed by stagnant wages and rising prices, councils have a duty
to ease the burden they place on residents.’

Hilary Benn, Labour’s Communities 
spokesman, said: ‘It is astonishing that Eric Pickles is trying to claim
a success when over two million people on the very lowest incomes will 
see their council tax rise next month.’
