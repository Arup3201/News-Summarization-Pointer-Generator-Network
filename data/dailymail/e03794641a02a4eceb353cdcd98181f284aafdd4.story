Fracking is unlikely to cause cancer - but more research is needed into its long-term effects, a health watchdog has warned.

Public Health England (PHE) has criticised a US study which claimed that residents living within half a mile of a site were slightly more likely to get cancer.

Scientists in Colorado used a computer model to predict that there would be an extra ten cases of cancer for those living within half a mile radius of a fracking drilling well. 

Health watchdog Public Health England has dismissed claims that fracking causes cancer. More than 1,000 protestors set up camp this summer outside an 'exploratory' site in Balcombe, West Sussex (pictured)

However the PHE - which is charged with protecting public health - believes the research may well be flawed and its findings simply down to chance.

It also dismissed the idea that people living near the sites will develop breathing difficulties and other medical problems, saying they ‘know enough’ to allay fears for now - although they admitted that very little research has been carried out into potential harms of the process.

Protest: Feelings have run high over the prospect of fracking in Britain. The process, 'hydraulic fracturing', involves pumping water underground at high pressure to crack shale rock and release gas

Dr John Harrison, director of PHE’s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, insisted that as long as fracking was carried out properly, the potential risks to public health would be ‘low’.

He said: ‘The currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to emissions that are associated with shale gas extraction process are low if the operations are properly run and regulated.’

However he conceded that research into the long-term health implications had been ‘limited’ – and said they would need to continue to monitor evidence as it emerged.

Professor John Newton, PHE’s chief knowledge officer, said: ‘This is by no means the end of the process.

‘We want to continue to collect the evidence and we want to continue to review the data.

‘We know enough about the process to provide this reassurance now.

‘But we should definitely collect the exposure information.

‘We need to understand what the emissions are in detail, so that is the primary thing.

‘However on the whole, the results are reassuring. We do not expect any adverse health effects.’

The Government believes that extracting shale gas by drilling thousands of feet underground could supply our future energy needs and drive down bills.

Environmental campaigners say it can cause small earth tremors as well as water contamination and air pollution – which could have long-term health implications.

More than 1,000 protesters staged a sit-in during the summer near Balcombe, West Sussex, when energy firm Cuadrilla began an ‘exploratory’ drilling operation.

The company was trying to find out how much gas was stored within the rocks and assess whether it can be easily extracted.

Another 40 sites across the UK – including areas in Manchester and Lancashire – have now been lined-up by the Government as places that could be suitable for fracking.

The Prime Minister recently urged the public to get behind the controversial technique.

But Leila Deen, energy campaigner at Greenpeace, said: ‘This report is a timely reminder of the risks inherent in fracking, and the potential long-term health impacts from industrial activity, traffic and the process of firing cocktails of chemicals into the ground in a densely populated country.

‘The Government has so far responded to these risks by cutting the budget of the environmental  regulator and effectively allowing companies to mark their own homework when it comes to monitoring.’
