Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar has warned on Facebook that the Islamic state will hold its position in Iraq and Syria 'by victory or martyrdom'.

This comes as ASIO director-general David Irvine said he is seriously considering lifting the terrorism threat alert level in Australia because of the number of people returning from fighting in Iraq and Syria.

Security agencies were aware of more than 20 people in Australia who had fought in the Middle East and posed a threat to national security, he told the ABC on Tuesday.

Elomar said: 'Islamic State still holds its position either by victory or martyrdom'  

This comes as Elomar, a former boxer from western Sydney who left to fight in Syria late last year, dismissed US military operations in Iraq and Syria.

When asked about media reports that Islamic State fighters are trying to return to their home countries, Elomar told News Corp: 'Maybe it's true, maybe it's propaganda. But Islamic State still holds its position either by victory or martyrdom. Besides, what can a bunch of planes do?'

Elomar, using the Facebook pseudonym 'Al Australi Abu Hafs', also claimed that American air strikes only 'hit civilians, not the Mujahideen'.

He then began referencing Chapter 9 of the Quran, which contains the 'Verse of the Sword' passage terrorists often cite to justify jihad.

'And when the forbidden months have passed, kill the idolaters wherever you find them and take them prisoners, and beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they repent and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, then leave their way free. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful,' the verse reads.

This comes as ASIO chief Irvine warned that the terrorism threat to Australia was now 'a very elevated level of medium'.

'I'm certainly contemplating very seriously the notion of lifting it higher because of the numbers of people that we are having to be concerned about here in Australia,' he said.

The 'medium' threat rating means a terrorist attack could occur in Australia and the 'high' level is used when government and agencies believe an attack is likely.

Australia's four-level alert system goes to extreme, when an attack is imminent or has occurred.

In announcing plans to strengthen anti-terrorism laws in August, Prime Minister Tony Abbott stressed the terrorist threat to Australia had not changed.

Australia has been at the 'medium' alert level since the four-tier system was introduced in 2003.

Mr Irvine retires at the end of this week.

He hands Australia's top security job to Duncan Lewis, a diplomat, former government national security adviser, defence department secretary and special forces soldier.

Mr Irvine said Australia had been named as a target for several years in publications from al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations.

'We are certainly aware of people wanting to conduct terrorist attacks in the West and in Australia,' he said.

'Whether it's a little bit more or a little bit less than 2001, I think we are facing a persistent threat.'
