Computer games might be more realistic than ever before with budgets and special effects compatible to blockbuster movies, but children and teenagers of the 80s and 90s still have a soft spot for the Super Mario Bros.

Now they can re-live their childhood as a 1980s version of the popular game is available to play online for free.

The website, fullscreenmario.com, created by Josh Goldberg, lets users worth through levels as well as skip to favourites, as well as build their own levels from scratch.

The website allows individuals to make their own levels using the classic blocks, green pipes and scenery. Here, Mail Online has had a quick go at laying out the beginning of a level. While it is easy to place objects, it is harder to imagine how to create a really great level that is difficult but not impossible to play!

'Full Screen Mario' allows gamers to play the original Mario Bros. in HTML 5, which works best using the Chrome browser, according to the website.

Fans can systematically work their way through the game, much like they would have done years ago on a Game Boy or NES, or skip to a specific level that they were perhaps unable to reach when they were younger - which means no using up hard-earned lives battling villains at the end of a collection of levels.

But best of all for Nintendo fans who thought they could come up with the ultimate level, the website allows individuals to make their own using the classic blocks, green pipes and scenery such as the distinctive bushes and bubbly clouds.

Super Mario Bros was first released in 1985 in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in Europe in 1987. The game has been highly influential and popularised the side-scrolling genre seen in many platform games. These are more modern versions of Mario and Luigi

Gamers can add characters, including 'koopa troupers' and mushrooms and save their levels as text files on their computer.

Now that the old game is easily accessible again it is available to a new younger audience, although it may not prove popular to generations that have grown up with 3D graphics.

It was the best-selling game of all time for around three decades, before Nintendo's Wii Sports took the title. But the game has been ported to almost every one of Nintendo's major gaming consoles, demonstrating its enduring appeal.

In the game, the player takes the role of the main protagonist, Mario, while his younger brother luigi can be controlled by a second player in the game's multi player mode.

The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowserâ€²s forces and save Princess Toadstool.

The player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level.
