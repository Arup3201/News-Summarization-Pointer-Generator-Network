A father and son targeted in a bungled police sting into stolen scrap metal have been cleared after a two-year legal battle which is thought to have cost the taxpayer more than £300,000.

David Day, 36, and his father Terrence, 61, were arrested and kept in police cells for eight hours after officers posing as scrap metal thieves tried to sell them what appeared to be stolen railway cable.

Although they refused to buy the items, the two undercover detectives are thought to visited their scrapyard 12 times to push the sale of what appeared to be stolen scrap metal.

Both men, who run Greengate Metals in Middleton, Greater Manchester, and colleague Billy Dillon, 57, were later charged with attempting to handle stolen goods, and encouraging the act of the stripping of railways cable. 

If convicted, they could have faced up to five years in jail.

But after a trial at Bolton Crown Court, all three men were acquitted of wrongdoing after it emerged the officers were working from an inaccurate edict from British Telecom and Railtrack - which wrongly claimed that certain cable offered on the open market must be stolen.

The sting occurred in 2012 during an operation against various scrap metal dealers in the area - and 17 suspects were arrested in total.  

Last month, three other scrap dealers targeted in the same police operation were cleared after a judge accused the undercover officers of 'wearing down' their suspects into accepting what appeared to appeared to be stolen cable.

David, from Blackley, Manchester said: 'The last two years have been hell. It's tarnished our name. None of us have ever been in trouble. 

David, pictured at the scrapyard, said they initially refused to buy the railway cable but agreed to buy copper wire when the undercover officers returned a week later

'Being in the dock was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. We knew we had not done anything wrong but we didn't know how the jury were thinking. 

'Before our arrest we had about 150 visits from police over the space of two years.

'Every time they came to the yard they always went around and never found anything yet despite us getting visits once or twice a week, they've always been treated with respect.' 

He explained the first time the officers tried to sell them railway cable, they had refused - only for them to return two days later. 

A week later, the officers returned with copper wire and the Days agreed to buy with the belief it was legitimately sourced and IDs were taken.. In October 2012 around 60 officers swooped on the scrapyard.

Mr Day added: 'Being kept in police cells for eight hours was the worst experience. The business had to be put on hold and my wife and kids became nervous wrecks. My wife was ringing me up in tears when she saw police vans. 

'There were times when we were considering selling up, my dad retiring.' 

'It's been a waste of taxpayers money. I've been told that each day we were in court it was costing £20,000 and we were in court for 18 full days.' 

He added that he had also spent £10,000 installing CCTV in the scrapyard. 

The sting affected trade at the scrapyard. David said: 'There were times when we were considering selling up'

David added the lengthy legal battle, which is thought to have cost more than £300,000, was a 'waste of money'

Mr Day's lawyer Sean Reilly said BT and Railtrack's error was a major flaw in the investigation.

He said: 'BT and Railtrack had told the police, erroneously, that certain specification cable was only manufactured for their industry, and that it does not exist on the open market, that this cable can only be owned by BT and Rail track. 

'This was wrong. Companies that manufacture cable are happy to sell their cable to whoever will buy it, after all they are in business to make profit and the more they sell the more profit they make. 

'Companies that buy from the manufacturers also sell off cuts on to the open market.' 

A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We are aware that a judge has raised concerns about a policing tactic used in an operation to target metal theft dealers suspected of handling stolen metal. 

'Following the judge's comments, the Crown Prosecution Service is reviewing other upcoming cases involved in this operation. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'
