Leicester Tigers have signed New Zealand legend Brad Thorn on a season-long deal.

The 39-year-old World Cup winner is expected to arrive at Welford Road in September and will provide cover for Australia-bound Steve Mafi.

Thorn has been capped 59 times by the All Blacks and will join an already strong second-row contingent that includes Ed Slater, Louis Deacon, Graham Kitchener and Geoff Parling.

'Brad Thorn will arrive in the next month or so and will be available to play for us by the end of September,' said Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill.

'He is 39 years old but he wants to play for another season. I had a long discussion with him about what he wants to do and he wants to play in the Aviva Premiership. 

'He wants to come here and test himself. That says a lot about him at this stage in his career, after all he has achieved, and the circumstances have created an opportunity for him here.

'We look forward to seeing him and bringing that experience into the squad.'

Thorn recently played for Dunedin-based Highlanders and also enjoyed a successful stint at Leinster.
