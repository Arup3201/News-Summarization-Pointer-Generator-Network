Fernando Alonso will go to Cambridge University on Sunday for medical tests as part of a three-part process that will determine whether he can return to Formula One in next weekend’s Malaysian Grand Prix.

The Spaniard missed the opening race of the season in Melbourne last week after suffering concussion in an unexplained testing accident in Barcelona.

Although Alonso has since posted Twitter messages declaring himself fit and ready, the FIA have appointed three Cambridge doctors to test him. If he passes these tests, he will travel to Kuala Lumpur for two further sets of analysis.

One will be carried out by the FIA’s medical delegate, Jean-Charles Piette, who will require Alonso to do a 45-minute computer test to assess his reaction times. His score will be compared with his previous results on the same test.

The local doctor at the Sepang International Circuit will also examine Alonso.

The belts-and-braces approach shows the concern among the Formula One community about how Alonso, 33, came to lose control of his McLaren last month. Technical problems have been ruled out by the team, who cited high winds as a cause.

The nagging fear remains that Alonso had an underlying medical complaint that meant he lost consciousness before he veered off track – a possibility that needs to be ruled out before he can compete again.
