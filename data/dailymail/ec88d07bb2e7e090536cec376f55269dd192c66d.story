Clayton Lockett was killed in a botched execution in April this year

It was the horrific execution which  opponents thought would spell the end to capital punishments across three conservative states in the U.S. 

As Clayton Lockett lay writhing under the influence of the lethal drugs, the execution turned into such a 'bloody mess' that the state tried to stop it before it was over.

But despite the harrowing scenes of the botched execution in Oklahoma - and other troubling ones this year across Ohio and Arizona - there appears to have been no change of heart in the feeling towards capital punishment in the three states.

Although Gov. Mary Fallin suspended further executions while Lockett's death and Oklahoma's methods were reviewed, the state is scheduled to resume killing inmates in mid-January. 

It came after officials hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the media, in which they gave a tour of the renovated execution unit at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, just six months after Lockett's death. 

Rather than sparking debate over capital punishment, the issues have actually led the states to explore new, old and more efficient ways of killing, including gassing inmates.

Lydia Polley, a longtime member of the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, said:

'I think we had a little flash of hope that it would help our cause, but all it did was generate a lot of conversation about it. It just led to people thinking of better ways to kill them.'

In Oklahoma, which is deeply conservative, Lockett's execution did little or nothing to dampen support for the death penalty.

The state has killed more inmates than any other state except Texas since the 1976 reinstatement of the death penalty.

In October, six months after Lockett's death, the execution unit was given a $104,000 overhaul. It now stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the shabby, 106-year-old facility.

Even after the upgrades, Oklahoma's Republican-led House conducted a study on the use of nitrogen gas to execute inmates.

It is expected to consider a piece of legislation early next year that would make Oklahoma the first state to adopt hypoxia by gas — the forced deprivation of oxygen — as a legal execution method.

Other conservative states also are exploring alternatives to lethal injection because of the problems securing the drugs.

U.S. states have had to buy made-to-order execution drugs from compounding pharmacies in recent years because the pharmaceutical companies they used to buy their drugs from refuse to sell them for use in lethal injections.

Tennessee passed a law this year to reinstate the electric chair if it can't get lethal injection drugs and Utah is considering bringing back the firing squad.

Oklahoma has executed 194 inmates since achieving statehood in 1907, including one by hanging, 82 by electrocution and 111 by lethal injection, according to state prison records.

But the use of the death penalty was common in the territory long before that.

U.S. District Judge Isaac Parker, who operated out of nearby Fort Smith, earned a reputation as the 'Hanging Judge' of the old West and presided over certain crimes committed in Indian territory.

'To me it's a reflection of our frontier culture,' said Oklahoma historian Bob Blackburn. 'Violence is a part of frontier culture, and vigilante justice has always been a strong element of our history.'

Ralph Shortey, a Republican state senator from Oklahoma City who is pushing for Oklahoma to adopt alternative execution methods to lethal injection, estimates that 90 percent of his constituents strongly support the death penalty, despite what happened to Lockett.

'The average Oklahoman is saying he got exactly what he deserves,' Shortey said. 'A lot of people think they should suffer even more than they do. They think the lethal injection is too easy for them.'

Oklahoma prison officials say they've secured the drugs they need to execute the next four inmates — the first is scheduled for Jan. 15 — unless a federal appeals court stands in their way.

The inmates are trying to stop their executions, arguing that the state would essentially be experimenting on them by injecting them with unproven and untested drugs, as well as violating the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

Richard Dieter is the director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based advocacy group that opposes capital punishment. 

He said: 'Just because you say you've renovated the execution chamber, doesn't mean a judge will be satisfied that you've identified the problems and have a strong guarantee they won't happen again.

'They may be optimistic about being able to go forward, but I think there are still a lot of questions out there.'
