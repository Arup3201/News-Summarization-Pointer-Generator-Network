Storm clouds are gathering at the summit of women's tennis as a feud between Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams looks set to run into the opening week of Wimbledon.

Williams arrived at the tennis tournament with her French coach turned boyfriend as Sharapova began her campaign, taking on France's Kristina Mladenovic in the second match on Centre Court.

The blonde Russian has been incensed by comments from world number one Williams that appeared in an American magazine.

Status: Mouratoglou and Williams have not spoken about the nature of their relationship, and there has been no confirmation that his marriage has ended

In a Rolling Stone feature, in which the
magazine's reporter had remarkable access to Williams, the 31-year-old 
was quoted as taking a swipe at a rival player during a phone 
conversation with sister Venus.Sharapova believes she was the target of Williams, as the article's author speculated.

In the article, Williams said of the 
unnamed player: 'She begins every interview with 'I'm so happy. I'm so 
lucky' - it's so boring. She's still not going to be invited to the cool
parties. And, hey, if she wants to be with the guy with a black heart, 
go for it.'

The latter reference has been widely 
taken to be aimed at Grigor Dimitrov, the Bulgarian player who is dating
Sharapova and had previously been close to Williams.

Sharapova shot back with a barb at 
Williams on Saturday, hinting at disapproval of the American's own 
relationship with French coach Patrick Mouratoglou.

'If she wants to talk about something
personal, maybe she should talk about her relationship and her 
boyfriend that was married and is getting a divorce and has kids,' 
Sharapova said.

Mouratoglou and Williams have not 
spoken about the nature of their relationship, and there has been no 
confirmation that his marriage has ended.

Yesterday, when Mouratoglou's name 
was brought up in Williams' pre-tournament press conference, she said: 
'I've always kept my personal and professional life very private. I'm 
going to continue to do that.'

Williams would have been taken by 
surprise by Sharapova's remarks on Saturday, having believed she put a 
cap on any ill-feeling when the pair spoke on Thursday at the WTA Tour's
pre-Wimbledon party in Kensington.

'I made it a point to reach out to Maria,' Williams said.

'I personally talked to Maria at the 
player party. I said, 'Look, I want to personally apologise to you if 
you are offended by being brought into my situation. I want to take this
moment to just pour myself, be open, say I'm very sorry for this whole 
situation'.

'We always have great conversations, so I believe that she definitely did accept it.'

Williams added: 'I know she also said
that I should definitely focus on the tennis here, and I feel like that
is another thing I can definitely take her advice on.'

Williams is clearly affronted that a 
conversation with Venus, that she believed would remain private, has 
reached the public domain.

But she said: 'I've been in the 
business for a little over 20 years, so I should definitely, definitely 
know better. I should know better to always have my guard up.'

Sharapova also spoke out against the controversial comments Williams made to Rolling Stone  earlier this month seemingly defending the boys who raped a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville, Ohio.

'I just think she should be talking 
about her accomplishments, her achievements, rather than everything else
that's just getting attention and controversy,' Sharapova said at the press conference.

She added, 'Nobody really cares about what I have 
to say, my opinions. If I speak to my friends, that's one thing. But I 
don't go out and try to create things that shouldn't be really talked 
about.'

In the article 16-time grand slam winner Williams says the perpetrators of the crime 'did something stupid,' and asks, 'Do you think it was fair, what they got?'

She adds, 'I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk like that, your parents should teach you: Don't take drinks from other people.'

After the interview in Rolling Stone, Williams apologized to the family of the rape victim.

'We just read Serena's updated comments and we're proud of her for correcting and clarifying her prior statements,' the family said, according to a statement issued on their behalf by attorney Bob Fitzsimmons.

'We are sure Serena has and will continue to use her God-given talents to advance women's equality and send the message that rape is never acceptable under any circumstance. '

'We are fans of Serena and will continue rooting for many more championships but more importantly watching her advance the cause of rape victims who are never to blame.'

Williams starts her campaign tomorrow against 92nd-ranked Mandy Minella from Luxembourg.
