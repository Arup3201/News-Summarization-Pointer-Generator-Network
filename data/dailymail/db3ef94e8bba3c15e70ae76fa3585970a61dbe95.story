MPs have been accused of increasing their family income by hiring relatives and giving them pay rises.

New figures show the bill for family members on the public payroll has soared by 50 per cent since the general election to hit almost £3.8million.

Several Cabinet ministers are among almost 170 MPs who declare that they have a relative on their staff, with their wages funded by the taxpayer.

New figures reveal a sharp increase in the cost of MPs' employing relatives, up from £2.4million in 2010-11 to almost £3.8million in 2013-14

In the wake of the MPs' expenses scandal, Parliament's standards watchdog called for a ban on politicians hiring loved ones to work in their office in the constituency or in the Commons.

But MPs attacked the 'incendiary' plan and threatened to get around the ban with a 'wife swap' arrangement, with spouses switching to work for backbenchers.

When the new expenses regime was introduced in 2010, MPs were allowed to hire one relative, with the details declared on a register.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which is now responsible for policing MPs' claims, has revealed a sharp increase in the practice.

In 2010 there were 137 MPs employing family members but the figure soared to 167 last year.

The total pay bill has rocketed from £24million in 2010-11 to almost £3.8million in 2013-14.

It means that the average salary paid to family members has risen by a third, from just over £17,101 to just over £22,400.

Sir Alistair Graham, a former chairman of the parliamentary standards committee, told the Sunday Times: 'It is just a handy way of boosting their income really isn't it? A 50% increase — they have had a good pay rise.

'Given that it is family members — in most cases spouses — in effect it is boosting family income and MPs are in reality effectively giving themselves an increase by increasing the pay of the family member who is working for them.

'It highlights really that given these people do not go through a competitive recruitment process, the present system is not really very acceptable.'

Sir Alistair did not call for a ban, but said there must be more scrutiny of the money being paid out.

Senior MPs who pay relatives include Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, whose wife Lynne earns up to £44,999, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon who pays his wife Wendy up to £19,999 and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's wife Susan earns up to £39,999.

Ipsa does not publish exact pay details, but gives salary bands in £5,000. Records show two Tory MPs pay their wives the most.

Peter Bone's wife Jeannette receives between £45,000 and £49,999 a year for working as her husband's office manager.

Christopher Chope's wife Christine is in in the same salary bracket.

Labour frontbencher Hilary Benn pays his wife Sally up to £24,999. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint pays her husband Phil Cole as her senior parliamentary assistant on up to £39,999.

Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher's wife Joanna earns up to £34,999 after moving up three pay bands when she became his office manager.

Ipsa said: 'We have introduced a number of restrictions and safeguards to regulate MPs employing family members or other connected parties.

'And, crucially, we think the public should know about these arrangements — which is why we publish all the details including the name, job title and salary range of all connected parties employed by MPs.'
