Jailed: Jordan Flattery went on the run after stabbing a father of two to death at a house party

A teenager who stabbed a disabled man to death following a row at a party has been jailed for 10 years for manslaughter.

Jordan Flattery, 19, knifed Graham Snowden, a father of two who was partially blind and had mobility problems after being seriously injured in a car crash.

The killing happened while the pair were at a house party in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, in January.

Mr Snowden, 36, had tried to get up from a sofa but was pushed back by Flattery.

The two men were asked to leave the house, but Flattery stabbed Mr Snowden as they were in the hallway.

Flattery was arrested two days later after going on the run.

Flattery, of Hitchin, was sentenced yesterday after being convicted last month.

He had been charged with murder, but a jury found him guilty of manslaughter after a trial at Croydon Crown Court.

After the sentencing hearing, Mr Snowden's family said in a statement that their 'world ended' when he 'had his life cruelly taken from him'.

They said: 'The court has sentenced Jordan Flattery to 10 years in custody after he was found guilty of the manslaughter of Graham, but it is us, Graham's family, who continue to serve a life sentence, as no sentence passed today can ever bring him back.

'Graham was a fighter, he survived a horrific car accident eight years ago which sadly took the life of his friend and colleague, and left Graham fighting for his own.

'He sustained life changing injuries in the collision which left him with limited sight and mobility problems.

'Cruelly taken': Relatives of manslaughter victim Graham Snowden said he so much to live for

'He fought for an hour to stay alive the night he suffered that fatal stab wound inflicted on him by Jordan Flattery and we know he did not want to leave this world as he had so much to live for.'

Detective Inspector Neil Langford, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'Firstly, our thoughts remain with the family of Graham Snowden who have shown incredible bravery throughout this process.

'Our thoughts remain with them through what continues to be an extremely difficult time for them.

'The actions of Jordan Flattery on January 8th were cowardly - he took a man's life and then fled from the scene.

'He deliberately carried a knife on him prior to this incident and this should act as a warning to those who commit such an offence, that you will be caught and dealt with.

'The sentence passed on him cannot bring Graham back but I hope it offers some closure to his family, who continue to live with the legacy the actions of Flattery have left behind from that night.'
