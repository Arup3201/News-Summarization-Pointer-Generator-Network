A television news program unwittingly had a hardcore porn film playing in the background during its live broadcast in Sweden.

The anchor was halfway through the broadcast on Sweden’s main commercial television channel TV4 earlier today, when an adult movie began playing behind her.

Viewers were shocked to see the hardcore porn clip on one of the monitors during a segment about the political climate in war-torn Syria.

The adult film was playing for ten minutes before management was alerted and it was turned off.

‘I thought I was mistaken, but it soon became pretty clear when I saw how they moved’, one viewer told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.

‘You could clearly see what was happening. It makes you wonder why they didn’t spot it sooner.’

TV4, whose parent company also owns several movie channels showing adult films at night, says the television screens in the newsroom are connected to the company computers.

Interesting news: It was during a phone interview with the television channel's Russia correspondent regarding the Syrian president that the clip began playing behind the anchor

‘No one was sitting there watching the film,’ says Andreas Haglind, managing editor, TV4News.

‘It is likely that a downloading process was in progress on one of the servers in the building and the film began playing by mistake.

‘We turned it off as soon as possible. This shouldn’t have to happen and it won’t happen again.’
