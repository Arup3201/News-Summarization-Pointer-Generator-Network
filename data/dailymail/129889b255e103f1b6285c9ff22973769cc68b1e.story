Mystery: French Alps murder victim Saad al-Hilli was pictured smiling just 33 minutes before he was gunned down

The British family who died in a hail of bullets in the Alps was pictured ‘smiling and relaxed’ just 33 minutes before they were found dead.

The time sequence was revealed six weeks after the Al-Hillis, from Claygate, Surrey, were killed on September 5 close to Lake Annecy, in France.

French investigators have a picture taken by the family in the village of Arnand, near to the murder site, at 3.15pm that day.

Eric Maillaud, the town’s prosecutor, said it could be a vital insight into how and why they came to die on September 5.

Engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf, were all found dead in the family BMW.

All died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire which also killed 45-year-old cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a French father-of-three who was hit by at least five bullets.

The Al-Hilli’s four-year-old daughter, Zeena, survived the attack unscathed after hiding under her mother’s corpse, while her sister, Zainab, seven, was badly injured.

Mr Maillaud said that a few minutes before their car had pulled up outside a house in the nearby village of Arnand, where they posed for the pictures.

Images retrieved in the BMW show ‘a real family photograph’, said Mr Maillaud. ‘Both women were smiling and did not seem worried. This suggests that everyone was relaxed at the time.’

But it is the timing of the pictures which is of particular interest to Mr Maillaud and two investigating French judges working with British detectives.

Brett Martin, a 53-year-old Englishman who used to be in the RAF, was the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle.

He has described how he gave first aid to Zainab, who had been shot in the shoulder and beaten savagely around the head.

Mr Martin said he also checked the pulse of Mr Mollier, turned off the BMW’s engine, and carried out a number of other tasks before realising his mobile phone did not have a signal.

He then cycled down the hill, away from the crime scene, and finally made a call to the emergency services logged at 15.48.

This would have meant a window of far less than 33 minutes for the killer – or killers – to end the lives of four people, attack a child, and disappear without trace through one of the most popular tourist regions in eastern France.

Detectives have been showing the photographs to villagers in the area but have refused to release them to the general public because, said one police officer, they are considered ‘morbid’.

It follows criticism that they are making little progress in the investigation, after only opening a witness hotline last week, and interviewing a relatively small 650 people on an investigation spanning at least six countries.

Not a single suspect has been found in all that time, with sightings of potential killers few and far between.

Mr Maillaud today renewed his appeal for the driver of a green 4x4 vehicle seen speeding towards the scene by Mr Martin to come forward, suggesting the car might have belonged to the national forestry office, the ONF. But Mr Maillaid added: ‘It’s a theory but there is no certainty.’

The prosecutor said that there was particular interest in a bank account in the nearby Swiss city of Geneva in Mr Al-Hilli’s name.

Believed to contain around three-quarters-of-a-million pounds, it is thought to be linked to a family will which Mr Al-Hilli and his brother, Zaid, were arguing about.

As well as the family feud, Mr Maillaud said the enquiry was concentrating on Mr Al-Hilli’s work on satellite systems, and his past life in Iraq, where he was born.
