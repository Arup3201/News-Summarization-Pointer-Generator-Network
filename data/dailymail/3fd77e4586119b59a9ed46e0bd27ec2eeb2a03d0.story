Jeff Hunter's body was discovered in the luxury unit he rented in Miraflores, Lima

The death of an Australian mining executive who was found dead in his apartment in Peru surrounded by drugs is now the subject of a murder investigation.

Jeff Hunter's body was discovered in the luxury unit he rented in Miraflores, Lima, with a plastic bag on his head, after he had spent the night with three women.

Two women and one man have been arrested but have yet to be formally charged.

By law, police have 15 days to investigate. During this time, they keep all suspects in a holding cell until the charges are formalised in front of a judge by the prosecution.

Initial reports from local media said police had ruled the 54-year-old's death a suicide after finding no signs of violence on his body. It is believed he died of asphyxia.

But Daily Mail Australia understands that local homicide police are conducting the investigation.

Mr Hunter's body was discovered by his housekeeper who knocked on the door with no answer and then called a locksmith.

His safe was reportedly found open with his laptop and mobile phone missing.

Mr Hunter lived in a high-class neighbourhood overlooking the ocean.

A doorman in the building, who did not wish to be named, told Daily Mail Australia: 'When they opened the door, something very personal was discovered.

'If I had to say I am surprised this happened to him, I would be lying and you'd be terribly disappointed to hear something that is contrary to what you want to believe.'

Mr Hunter was working in Lima as health and safety manager at Peruvian mining company STRACON GyM

Mr Hunter was working in Lima as health and safety manager at Peruvian mining company STRACON GyM.

He worked at a mine in Mt Carlton, Queensland, in 2012 and had previously lived in Charters Towers, near Townsville.

Over the past decade he also worked for companies in China, Ghana, Laos and Jamaica.

His sister Wendy Hunter-Carter, who lives in Townsville along with Mr Hunter's mother and daughter, posted about his death on social media, the Townsville Bulletin reported.

'To let you all know that Jeff Hunter has sadly passed away September, 2014,' she wrote.

'Much loved husband, father, son, brother and uncle.'

It is expected that his body will be flown back to Australia.

STRACON GyM released a statement following his death: 'The company has been in contact with Jeff's family in Australia and the Australian Embassy here in Lima, to ensure appropriate steps are taken and support provided to Jeff's family. Our thoughts are with Jeff's family and friends at this sad time.'

Mr Hunter's former colleagues told the Bulletin he left Australia in 'mysterious circumstances' in 2012 claiming he was being followed by the Japanese mafia.
