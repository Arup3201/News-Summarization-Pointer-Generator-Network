Roberto Di Matteo has been unveiled as the manager of Schalke after appearing at a Veltins Arena press conference.

The Bundesliga strugglers named the former Chelsea boss as their new manager on Tuesday having sacked Jens Keller following a torrid start to the season.

The Italian, who won the Champions League as boss with the Blues in 2012, has been without a club since being sacked by the Premier League club in November of the same year.

Speaking on his appointment, Di Matteo confirmed that former Crystal Palace player and Italy team-mate Attilio Lombardo will be among his assistants as he targets a Champions League finish for his new side.

Lombardo is joined by goalkeeper coach Massimo Battara, with the duo formerly part of Roberto Mancini's back room staff at Manchester City.

'Attilio Lombardo is new assistant coach alongside Sven Pretty,' Di Matteo said. 'He brings a wealth of international experience as a player and as a coach. 

'For the goalkeeper training Massimo Battara will be responsible. He also has a lot of experience in different leagues, as Lombardo was active in Italy and England.

'Both speak no German, but it will learn very quickly. Until then, the communication in English will work, because I do not see any problems.

'We want to qualify again for the Champions League. This objective of the association is released before the season, and that's my claim.'

Di Matteo also admitted he was looking forward to the challenge of turning around the German club, while pointing to former Chelsea boss Ruud Gullit as one of his managerial influences.

'At Chelsea I worked with Ruud Gullit. From him I learned the Dutch mentality. I think you take from each coach, under which you have played something with.

'I have watched intensely the performances of Schalke. We have a good team, a team with a lot of potential going forward. But defensively it is a problem, which is certainly also due to some players that were injured or still are. We need time and patience to improve. In football there are no miracles.

'Which system I choose is always dependent on the players that are available. I want to let my team act flexibly. Recently I have set up both in the 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3. The defence, and by that I mean not just the back four must be stable.

'It is important that the balance between defensive and offensive is right. Individually, each player must make a contribution so that the team is successful. The team as a whole one. My goal is to get from each player the maximum.

'I am a trainer who communicates a lot with his players. Since I was for many years a professional, I know how players tick, what motivates them, how to deal with them. Each individual has a different mentality.

I love working with young players. Especially, of course, when they come from the club's youth system. If a player is talented, I am the first giving him a chance to prove themselves.

Di Matteo refused to comment on the Champions League group stage meeting with former club Chelsea later in the year, saying he preferred to take each match game-by-game.

Di Matteo, who was replaced at Stamford Bridge by Rafa Benitez, was still being paid £130,000-a-week by the Blues until June 2014, but has signed a three-year deal with the Royal Blues in Germany.

The 44-year-old's new side face Chelsea in the Champions League group stage in Gelsenkirchen on November 25. 

The Bundesliga club announced Keller's dismissal on Twitter on Tuesday after a disappointing start to the season that has seen Schalke pick up only eight points in seven league games.

The team lost 2-1 to Hoffenheim on Saturday and has also been knocked out of the German Cup by third-division Dynamo Dresden.

Keller was appointed Schalke's coach in December 2012 but faced constant speculation over his position.
