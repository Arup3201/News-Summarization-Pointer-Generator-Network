Manchester City and Newcastle United's players are to be treated with a warm-weather trip to the Middle East next week but Burnley's Sean Dyche has very different ideas for his squad.

Manuel Pellegrini's side will be leaving the grey skies of Manchester for the soaring heat of Abu Dhabi, after their clash with Arsenal on Sunday.

During their stay in their owners homeland, they will take on German side Hamburg on Wednesday in a friendly at the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium before heading back home to take on Championship high-flyers Middlesbrough in the FA Cup Fourth Round.

Sean Dyche, however, joked about his Burnley side heading to Scarborough for their mid-season break 

Managerless Newcastle will be embarking on a trip to the nearby United Arab Emirates, 24 hours after their home match to high-flying Southampton.

The club insist that the trip would have happened regardless of them being in the FA Cup or not, and fans will be hoping there won't be of three years ago, when the players were pictured partying while in Tenerife.

However, Dyche has other ideas for his players and admits that he might treat them to a get-away in Scarborough.

Unbeaten in their three previous Premier League games, the Clarets will be hoping to keep themselves out of the bottom three with a result against a revived Crystal Palace.
