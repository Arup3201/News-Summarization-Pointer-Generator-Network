The lack of border checks on private planes landing in Britain may be allowing organised crime bosses to fly in and out of Britain with impunity, MPs warned last night.

The chairman of an influential committee in Parliament warned that the failure of border officials to conduct passport and other checks on small aircraft could be ‘letting billionaire gangsters off the hook’.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge made her warning in a damning report about failures at the Border Force - a Home Office agency tasked with protecting Britain’s borders.

Warning: Margaret Hodge, Labour Party Member of Parliament and chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee. A Damning report about failures at the Border Force has been released

The Public Accounts Committee’s report into Border Force found staff shortages meant freight coming in to the country’s sea and air ports went unchecked - potentially allowing in illicit goods and illegal immigrants.

It also warned:

:: A major IT system, the Warnings Index, used to stop terrorists and criminals from getting in to Britain is ‘at risk of collapse’.

:: Staff had been fired, paid off lump sums in redundancy and then re-hired when crisis hit.

:: Nearly forty per cent of passengers are not screened in advance of landing

Mrs Hodge said Border Force was unable to meet and check up to 90,000 private planes and private boats arriving in the UK each year - leaving the UK border ‘vulnerable’.

Known as ‘general aviation’ this sector has long been a concern as a possible route into Britain for drugs, illegal migrants and organised criminals.

The report found huge gaps in the data the agency receives on people landing private planes or boats in Britain.

The report said: ‘The information the Border Force receives on incoming private planes and boats is notably poor, and there is concern that those able to access private planes and boats can evade border checks.

‘The intelligence alerts to frontline Border Force staff on potential threats are of limited utility as they are generated from cross-checking data on legacy systems not designed for this purpose.’

Border Force was hived off as a separate agency 18 months ago after it emerged passengers were being waved through without proper checks to keep airport delays to a minimum.

But the report warned there was ‘little evidence’ since then of progress in tackling existing problems.

MPs also criticised the agency for ‘too readily’ using national security as an excuse for not providing information to the committee or the National Audit Office.

It found the agency had cut staff numbers by 500 between 2010 and last year but then increased front line numbers by 400 when new checks were imposed.

‘Paying out redundancy and then rehiring staff is bad value for money and demonstrates poor planning’, the report said.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘The Border Force prioritised passenger checks on arrival at the expense of other duties and weakened the security of our borders.

‘The force neglected to examine freight for illicit goods, neglected to check lorries in Calais for concealed illegal entrants, and failed to check passengers coming into Britain on private planes or boats, potentially letting billionaire gangsters off the hook.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Border Force was split from the UK Border Agency last year to create a separate command with a clear security and law enforcement ethos.

‘It is making significant improvements in its performance - excessive queues at airports are gone and security strengthened. This extends to both passengers and goods and is underpinned, for the first time, by a clear Operating Mandate set by ministers.

‘It will take time to transform Border Force and fix all the problems we inherited but I am confident that we are making the right changes. None of the issues raised in this report come as a surprise and they are already being actively addressed.’
