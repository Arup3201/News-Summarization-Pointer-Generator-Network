The face of numerous advertising campaigns, front covers pages and editorials, she is considered one of the most renowned supermodels of  today, recently gracing the cover of the September issue - regarded as the most prestigious of the year - of British Vogue.

At just 29, Daria Werbowy's professional career has led to international acclaim and appearances on the world’s most exclusive catwalks.

Now Werbowy, who is of Polish origin but moved to Canada at the age of three, has been announced as the main face of Mango this season.

In this behind the scenes peak at Daria's new Mango campaign, the Canadian model looks fresh faced and relaxed in a thin white sleeveless shirt

And the model has big shoes to fill, taking over from fellow supermodel Miranda Kerr.

The
Australian beauty, 30, who has been the face of the brand for the past
year, with previous famous faces that have represented the fashion 
house including Penélope Cruz, Karolina Kurkova, Naomi Campbell, Eva 
Herzigova, Claudia Schiffer, and Christy Turlington.

It's been a tough few weeks for Kerr, 30, who announced her separation from Orlando Bloom less than a month ago.

Although the full campaign starring Miranda's successor has yet to be released, the behind-the-scenes snap of Daria posing for the latest Mango campaign, shows the model posing by a pier, with her hair swept across her face.

The sleeveless white linen shirt she wears gives fans of the Spanish brand a sneak peak of Mango’s new season collection. 

Despite acknowledging on several occasions that the world of modelling was not her first career choice, her feline eyes and sculptured physique have attracted the attention of big fashion houses every season.

In an article in Interview magazine, Daria admitted she is still bemused by her success.

'Sometimes I am still surprised that I'm a model and that people think I'm good-looking,' she says. I've gone through a lot of different phases on what I do and why I do it - morally and ethically... I just had to learn to look at it as a job, as opposed to identifying myself as a model and thinking of myself as a part of this industry.'

The Austrailian beauty has been the face of the brand for the past year

Miranda Kerr was the star of Mango's AW campaign last year, but will now be replaced with Daria

According to Ninona Vila, MNG by Mango’s PR Manager: 'As part of our policy of collaborating with celebrities from the world of fashion, Mango has decided to collaborate with one of top fashion models of the moment.

'In choosing a model of the stature of Daria Werbowy, our aim is not only to highlight our brand values, but also the importance of the quality and design of the garments in the new collection.'

Daria will model the new collection which includes flowing silhouettes, hippie-inspired embroidery and tribal looks, combined with tassels and metallic fittings.
