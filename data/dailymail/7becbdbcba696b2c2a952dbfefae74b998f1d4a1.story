Mariah Yeater has claimed Justin Bieber had told her it was his first time when they had a seedy liaison backstage at one of his concerts.

Yeater, 20, who alleges that Bieber is the father of her baby, said the 17-year-old singer had told her he was a virgin before hastily removing her clothes in a bathroom.

Californian Yeater also claims that her sexual encounter with Bieber was 'brief, lasting 
only approximately 30 seconds'.

Here is the first photo of the Californian woman who has alleged was secretly fathered by the pop world's biggest teen idol, Justin Bieber

Yeater reportedly 
claimed in court papers that she had sex after the singer’s October 25, 
2010, concert at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles.

In an affidavit, she allegedly said a 
security guard working for Bieber approached her and ‘asked if I wanted 
to meet Justin Bieber’ before shepherding her backstage.

‘After waiting for a short period of 
time with several young women, Justin Bieber appeared and engaged me in 
conversation,’ Miss Yeater reportedly says.

‘Immediately, it was obvious that we 
were mutually attracted to one another, and we began to kiss. Shortly 
thereafter, Justin Bieber suggested that I go with him to a private 
place where we could  be alone.

‘I agreed…and on the walk to a private area, he told me he wanted to make love to me and this was going to be his first time.’

She said he led her to a bathroom 
where ‘immediately his personality changed drastically’.

She allegedly 
claimed: ‘He began touching me ... at the time I asked him to put a 
condom on for protection, but he insisted that he did not want to.’

Yeater now wants the 17-year-old to 
take a paternity test to ‘scientifically confirm’ he is the father of 
her three-month-old son, according to Star magazine in the U.S.

In court papers filed on Monday, she is also demanding Bieber 'provide adequate support for  my baby'.

A spokesman for Bieber denied the 'malicious' allegations while the star himself dismissed them as 'gossip'.

'I’m gonna focus on the positives...the music,' he tweeted yesterday.

Yeater claims she was 19 when she was 
seduced by the Canadian, who is currently dating Selena Gomez, 19, best 
known for her role on the Disney show Wizards of Waverly Place.

Bieber has publicly blasted casual sex
in the past, saying: ‘I don’t think you should have sex with anyone 
unless you love them.’

In a bizarre twist, however, Miss 
Yeater may be the one who is in trouble because Bieber was 16 at the 
time of the alleged incident.

Focusing on music: The 17-year-old teen idol took to his Twitter page today telling fans that he was choosing to ignore the rumours and rather concentrate on his music

Under California law, the legal age of 
consent is 18 and police are required to launch a rape inquiry into any 
claims of illicit sex. 

The baby – Tristyn Anthony Markhouse Yeater – was born on July 6.

Meanwhile, Yeater's grandfather Eddie Markhouse has come forward to insist his granddaughter is telling the truth.

He
told Radaronline.com: 'I don't know the whole story. But, from what I 
understood, she met him at a concert and he sent two security guards 
down off of the stage to bring her backstage to meet him.

'She's basically an honest good person. She's got a big heart. She's a good kid and she loves this baby.'

Bieber has sold millions of records 
around the world after first being discovered in 2008 when a talent 
manager spotted his videos on YouTube.

His debut album My World went platinum.

What will Selena say? Justin has been dating his girlfriend for the past ten months

Out and about: Selena Gomez also stepped out tonight despite the rumours and attended a charity event in L.A.

Bieber was raised by his mother, 
Pattie as a devout Christian and says he talks to Jesus and 'he’s the 
reason I’m here'. He is said to pray before concerts.

Bieber has been dating girlfriend Selena Gomez since the end of last year but 
the couple waited until the Oscars in March to make their first public 
debut together.

Last month when the couple were both 
in Winnipeg and they spent an amorous evening watching the basketball  
together and were seen smooching from a private box.

They also adopted a dog together, whom they have named Baylor, from an
animal rescue centre in Winnipeg on October 14.

Bieber continued his professional duties last night in the wake of the claims with a performance on Dancing With The Stars.

Gomez also stepped out with a red carpet appearance at a charity event in Los Angeles.
