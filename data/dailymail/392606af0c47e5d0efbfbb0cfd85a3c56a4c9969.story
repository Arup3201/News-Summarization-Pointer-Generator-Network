When mortgage banker Geoff Black is not stuck in the office, he is taking photos of his adorable twin girls. 

The proud father from Sacramento, U.S. picked up his first camera, a Nikon 90, when his daughters were born fours years ago and he has not stopped snapping them ever since. 

Fourteen cameras later and a lot of film, Mr Black has produced an intimate set of photographs showing his children blossoming from babies into beautiful young girls.

The pictures have been posted to photo sharing site Flickr which he calls 'The Ladies - Life with Identical Girls.'

Speaking to My Modern Met, Mr Black said: 'I shoot for myself and for my family, to chronicle their lives.

'At first I was just trying to take pretty pictures of my kids. Then I learned a lot more about photography, I want to show their characters within the reality of our daily lives without it being mundane.' 

Mr Black decided to buy a camera after friends kept sending him pictures of their children on their mobile phones.

His favourite photo is one taken moments after the girls were born who are being cradled with their mother which is says represents love, relief and success. 

He describes Jamisen, or Baby A, as stubborn and bossy at times but sensitive who looks after her sister who was born one minute after her. 

Jacksen, or Baby B, is helpful and a listener whereas her sister has a mischievous side and will want to 're-write the rules'.
