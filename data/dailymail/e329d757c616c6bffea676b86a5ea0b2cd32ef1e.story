A French company has created dozens of vibrant iron gravestones with custom-made images emblazoned across them in a bid to add some colour and individuality to the country's graveyards.

Funeral Concept began producing the unusual gravestones in September 2012 and have since created about 100 unique designs.

The creations vary and can be anything from a cheeky message reading 'Thanks for not peeing on my grave' to a bright pink creation emblazoned with lips, make-up and hearts.

Founder Freddy Pineau said he came up with the idea after realising many of the traditional gravestones formed a 'gloomy selection.'

He said that after buying a laser cutter at the company where he worked he felt compelled to create his own 
painted steel models, which he then showed to professionals.

'The 
enthusiastic response to my models confirmed that there was a real void 
to be filled,' he told Vice magazine.

Joy: Mr Pineau said that although his company's designs are sometimes met with surprise by gravestones managers they are usually 'happy that we bring a bit of joy to a place that is in dire need of it'

He explained that his designers try not to refuse any special request as 'legally only city officials can judge whether the artwork is offensive, even if it's on a gravestone'

Mr Pineau the project he is most proud of is the grave the company created for Serge Danot, creator of Pollux and the Magic Roundabout.

'It really helped the company take off, because pictures of it circulated very rapidly across France.'
