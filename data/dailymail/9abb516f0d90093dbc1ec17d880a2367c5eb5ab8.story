A fog rolled out across Sydney at dawn break this morning which prompted locals to capture the atmospheric shots and share the images on social media.

The first day of spring has cleared to be a typically crisp and sunny day for the beginning of the blooming season but not before the misty blanket covered the city's famous skyline on Monday.

The Opera House was barely visible across the foggy harbour while Sydney Harbour bridge was poking out through the morning haze.

One image shows a thick fog stretching across the horizon behind a ferry in the harbour.

Bureau of Meterology's meteorologist Sarah Chadwick said Sydney airport experienced more of a mist than a fog with visibility reducing to 8,000 metres.

The airport was predicted on average to only have a fog in the area no more than twice this month.

An airport spokeswoman said there was low visibility between 4.55am and 6.45am on Monday but the airport did not close.

'Sydney airport has made a multi-million dollar investment to be upgraded from a category 1 to a category 2, so the majority of planes can operate as normal during fog,' she said.

However, some domestic airlines decided to cancel or delay flights.

Richmond in Sydney's north-west suffered from the most fog which came through at about 12.50am and didn't clear until 8.30 this morning with visibility below 1,000 metres.

The suburb was expected on average to experience as many as six foggy periods this month.

Ms Chadwick said fog was caused from clear skies overnight allowing the surface temperatures to cool down for the fog droplets to form.

'The air needs to be a little bit moist rather than dry conditions,' she said. 'When the temperature cools down to what we call the fog point it then condenses into liquid form instead of being clear invisible gas form to become clouds.'

This comes just three days after a thick blanket of heavy fog created travel chaos for people heading into Melbourne Airport.

Visibility was reduced to about 150 metres at the airport and across the city.

Photos of the city show its skyscrapers barely visible and the wings of planes just poking through the fog at the airport.

Bouts of the fog had been causing trouble in Victoria's capital city over the past couple of weeks.

Melbourne Airport spokeswoman Anna Gillett said the fog had forced some international flights to divert to other cities and some incoming domestic flights had been delayed but, at this stage, departures were not badly affected.

'We're advising people to jump on to their airline's website and check for updates to their schedules but at this stage come to the airport as normal,' Ms Gillett said.

Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Terry Ryan said the fog should begin to lift later on Friday morning.

Bemused: 'Melbourne covered in fog for the third morning in a row, starting to feel like Gotham City,' Kieran Jones said on Twitter on Friday

'It should begin to lift at the airport around 10-ish but generally it will take a while to clear from the city area and the suburbs because it takes a while for the sun to heat things up,' he said.

The fog should clear Melbourne by lunchtime, he said.

Mr Ryan said a slow moving weather pattern with a high pressure ridge over Victoria and light winds had caused this week's foggy conditions.

'It's a very unusual weather pattern for this time of year,' he said.

'A pattern like this is normally associated with autumn.'

Melbourne is expecting a sunny top of 18C on Friday, with sunshine and temperatures into the low 20C range over the weekend ahead of showers and a cooler change on Monday.
