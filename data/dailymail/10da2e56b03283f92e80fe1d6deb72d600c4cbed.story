Is this the most impressive cable car ride in the world? Pictured: Huashan Cableway in Shaanxi, China

Huashan Cableway (Shaanxi, China)

One of the most dangerous mountains in China, the five sacred peaks of Mount Huashan offer even the most experienced climbers a serious challenge.

To reach the north peak summit, adventurers must trek 5,300ft at nearly vertical angles, while the west peak towers 6,700ft in the sky. Lucky for those who don't want to endure the climb, cable cars have been installed to shuttle visitors to both peaks while providing breath-taking views.

Grindelwald-Mannlichen Gondola Cableway (Switzerland)

Originally developed to help Swiss Alps skiers reach the 7,700ft Mannlichen summit, the gondola cableway now shuttles up to 900 passengers per hour from Grindelwald year-round.

The entire track measures 3.5 miles and offers stunning sky-high views of the Bernese Oberland region - no matter the season. Round-trip journeys start at €26 (or about £20).

In the Swiss Alps, visitors can take in the snow-covered mountains on the Grindelwald-Mannlichen Cableway

Table Mountain Aerial Cableway is one of South Africa's most popular tourist attractions

Table Mountain Aerial Cableway (Cape Town, South Africa) 

One of South Africa's most popular tourist attractions, the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway has shuttled more than 23 million visitors since its opening in 1928.

At its top point, the Table Mountain plateau (3,500ft), visitors are privy to spectacular views of Cape Town and Table Bay. Best of all? During the ascent and descent, the cable cars rotate 360 degrees, providing a truly panoramic experience.

This cable car ride - high above Rio - is divided into two different stages. The first 720ft from Praia Vermelha (Red Beach) to Morro da Urca (Urca Hill) and the second up to Sugarloaf Mountain is an additional 1,300ft.

Look down on the city's famous beaches and rock climbers attempting to ascend Sugarloaf and other nearby mountains.

The Ngong Ping Cable Cars have a special Crystal Cabin glass-bottom gondola for adventurous riders

Ngong Ping Cable Car (Lantau Island, Hong Kong)

This gorgeous four-mile ropeway is the first of its kind in Hong Kong. Passengers will cross the Tung Chung Bay before heading towards North Lantau during their 25-minute ride, with views of the South China Sea in the distance.

For the more adventurous travellers, try the one-of-a-kind Crystal Cabin with a glass bottom for a true bird's eye view.

The longest and highest cable car in the world, Teleferico de Merida, closed in 2008 but is set to reopen

Teleferico de Merida/Mukumbari (Merida, Venezuela)

The world's longest and highest cable car - it runs eight miles in four stages, reaching 15,600ft in altitude - offers spectacular views of the snow-capped Andean peaks.

Although it was closed in 2008 for re-construction efforts, it's due for a 2014 re-opening, complete with a new name, 'Mukumbari,' which means 'the place where the sun is born'.

From Banff, Alberta, to Queenstown, New Zealand, these cable car rides offer passengers stunning vistas

The Banff Gondola (Banff, Canada)

The Banff Gondola offers gorgeous views of six nearby mountain ranges, the Bow Valley and the picturesque town below.

The eight-minute ride takes visitors 7,500ft to the top of Sulphur Mountain, where they can enjoy lunch or dinner in the sky, or visit the weather station, which is a short walk away from the mountain-top station.

Skyline Queenstown (Queenstown, New Zealand) 

The steepest cable car lift in the Southern Hemisphere, the Skyline Queenstown is specially-designed for adrenaline junkies. First, enjoy the views 1,500ft above Lake Wakatipu on the way to Bob's Peak, where the first-ever gondola-assisted bike park is located.

There are over 24 mountain biking trails at Queenstown Bike Park.

The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in California is the world's largest rotating aerial tramway

Palm Springs Aerial Tramway (Palm Springs, California) 

Scale the cliffs of Chino Canyon in the world's largest rotating aerial tramway.

The 10-minute ride takes travellers from the Valley Station to the end-point Mountain Station, at an elevation of about 8,500ft.

Skiers and snowboarders in particular enjoy the Gulmarg-to-Kongdoori ropeway

Gulmarg Gondola (Jammu and Kashmir, India) 

This two-stage ropeway ferries travellers to and from Kongdoori Mountain, which has an elevation of almost 14,000ft. Asia's longest cable car project is an especially great attraction for skiers and snowboarders, as the Kongdoori Valley station offers fantastic powdery snow.

But it's the optional second-leg of the journey that takes visitors above the clouds to the top of the Afarwat Mountains.
