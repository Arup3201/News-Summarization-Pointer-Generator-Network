A woman suffocated her elderly mother in a suspected mercy killing before stabbing herself to death, it emerged today.

Kathleen Sawyer, 64, and her frail mum Irene, 95, were found dead in their terraced house in Kings Heath, Birmingham, on February 11.

Police initially treated the deaths as 'unexplained' but a post mortem has now confirmed Irene died as a result of suffocation, and that Kathleen was killed by blood loss from a chest injury.

West Midlands Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths and the matter has now been referred to the coroner.

It had been feared the pair, who were found in the living room of the home they shared, had died after breathing in fumes from the gas fire.

'Doting' daughter Kathleen was a full-time carer to her mother, who had experienced a sharp decline in health in the 12 months before her death.

An inquest will now be held to probe the possibility that Kathleen killed her mother out of mercy before taking her own life.

Speaking after their deaths, Irene’s sister-in-law Hilda Goodwin, 84, said Irene, who worked in a curtain shop until she retired, could no longer get upstairs and slept in a bed in the living room.

Hilda said: 'Irene’s legs had gone so she slept downstairs in the living room and Kathleen would usually go up to bed after making sure her mum was warm and had enough blankets.

'Kathleen doted on her mum completely, she never went out apart from to get groceries. Kathleen lived in that house all her life - 64 years.

'She only had one job her whole life, working for social security and she went about as high as she could go in that job.

'It’s strange that they died as they lived - together.'

'They died as they lived': The mother and daughter were found in the living room of their home in Kings Heath, Birmingham, on February 11

Detective Inspector Pete Dunn, of West Midlands Police, said at the time of the deaths: 'Neighbours contacted police out of concern that neither woman had been seen for some time.

'They could see the fire was on through the window but weren’t getting an answer at the door.'

Neighbour Janet Wheatley, 69, said her daughter raised the alarm after they hadn’t seen the pair for four days.

She said: 'They kept themselves to themselves mostly, Irene had been very ill so she mostly stayed in the house. You’d sometimes see Kath push her out in a wheelchair but only to go to the park or something like that.'

Mrs Wheatley said she had gone round to the house three times after her husband noticed uncollected milk bottles piling up outside.

'I went around there three times, I was banging away on the window, lifting the letterbox up, calling Kath’s name, thinking they’d answer but they didn’t,' she said.

'My daughter came round and called the police at about half past six.'

Officers found the pair in the living room of their £140,000 terraced house in Balaclava Road.

Mrs Wheatley told of her shock at the deaths of her neighbours.

'They were nice people, Kath was a very caring girl, a lovely person really,' she said.

'I used to see her leaving for work and she’d just be walking up the street looking back and waving goodbye to her mum.'

She added that Kathleen Sawyer, who had never married, was an only child and her father Frank died around 30 years ago from a stroke.
