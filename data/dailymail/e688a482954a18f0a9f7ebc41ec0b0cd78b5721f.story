Britain is handing out £600,000 every week in child benefits to European immigrants whose children live abroad.

The most recent figures show that 20,400 families received payments for a total of 34,268 children, setting back taxpayers £31million a year – or some £600,000 every week.

A detailed breakdown of the figures revealed that nearly two-thirds of the children are in Poland, with payments for 22,093 youngsters going to the eastern European country.

Of the rest, 1,231 families in Ireland get cash for 2,505 children, while 1,215 families in Lithuania, 797 in Latvia and 789 in France also benefit.

Children living abroad receive the same amount of money as those in the UK – even if they have never set foot here – despite the cost of living being much lower in many other countries.

Migrants working here claim the UK money rather than use equivalent schemes at home as the handouts are much more generous.

Parents receive £20.50 a week for their first child and £13.55 for any further children in Britain.

By contrast, the Polish government pays out £13.60 a week for children under five, £18.20 for children aged 5-18 and £19.60 for those aged 18-24 in education.

The figures were uncovered by Labour – who accused David Cameron of ‘giving up’ on reform to EU benefit rules and attacking the payment of child benefit abroad as ‘unfair and not affordable’.

Labour’s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves raised the issue with French government ministers in Paris this week. She said: ‘David Cameron’s government seems to have given up any effort to end the scandal of millions of pounds of child benefit being sent abroad every year.

‘Rather than admitting defeat the Prime Minister should be ordering his ministers to work with governments across the European Union to bear down on this abuse of our benefits system.

‘People who work hard and pay in to the social security system are right to be angry when they see child benefit being sent abroad.

‘It’s unfair and it’s not affordable. That’s why I have raised this important issue with French government ministers this week. If the Tory-led government continues to fail to act over millions in child benefit being sent abroad each year, a Labour government will.’

Miss Reeves will also meet a series of ministers from other EU countries to argue for an end to what she called ‘abuse’ of the child benefit system

Miss Reeves will also meet a series of ministers from other EU countries to argue for an end to what she called ‘abuse’ of the child benefit system.

Earlier this year David Cameron admitted changes to the rules will have to wait until after the 2015 election. He said: ‘Today if you travel and work from another European country into Britain, you can then claim child benefit and other benefits for your family back at home even though actually they’re not living in the UK and going to UK schools and all the rest of it.

‘And under the current rules, it seems extremely difficult, if not impossible, to change that.

‘Now I haven’t met anybody who thinks this is sensible … so that is again a really big change.’

However, when in opposition, the Tories pledged to change the rules so the controversial payments would cease. The party’s then Treasury spokesman Philip Hammond said: ‘It beggars belief that Gordon Brown is continuing to send millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to children who don’t even live in this country.’

The number of families claiming benefits for children living abroad has fallen slightly in the past two years by 3,682.

But recent changes to child benefit rules mean that families in Britain where one parent earns more than £60,000 a year do not receive any child benefit, and the money is cut on a sliding scale for those earning between £50,000 and £60,000.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘As the Prime Minister has made clear, we need to change the rules around paying child benefit in respect of children who live in other European countries. 

'We need a change of EU law to do this, which is why the Government is pursuing renegotiation of the relevant EU rules with our European counterparts.’
