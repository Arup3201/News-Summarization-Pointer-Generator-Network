A middle school principal has been charged with sexually abusing a male student over a period of three years starting when he was 13 years old.

Greg Tibbetts - who has been the principal of Vicksburg Middle School for the last nine years - was charged with second-degree criminal sexual conduct and several offenses related to using a computer to possess or distribute sexually abusive material.

Vicksburg Superintendent Charles Glaes told the Kalamazoo Gazette that the boy was a 13-year-old student at Tibbetts' school when the alleged abuse began in 2010. It allegedly continued until earlier this year when he was 16. Tibbetts, 42, was placed on leave in late September.

The boy is now a student at Vicksburg High School now, Glaes said.

Tibbetts is facing one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct, five counts of using a computer with child sexually abusive material, five counts of possessing child sexually abusive material, one count of using a computer to solicit another to commit distribution of child sexually abusive material, and a count of exhibiting sexually abusive material to a minor.

Glaes  told Michigan Live that the investigation took him and other Vicksburg officials  by total shock.

'Greg has been a very trusted and very capable administrator,' he said. 'When we were first notified by law enforcement about this, I said that if there was anyone who was the least likely candidate for something like this, it was Greg Tibbetts. But these are terribly serious charges.'

A letter was sent on Monday to parents with children in Vicksburg Community Schools telling them counselors would be available for any students affected 'to deal with concerns and emotional issues students might have regarding the investigation'.
