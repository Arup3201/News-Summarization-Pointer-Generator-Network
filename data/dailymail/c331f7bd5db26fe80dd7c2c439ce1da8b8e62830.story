Playing tricks on your senses can have some interesting effects, especially when you suffer from motion sickness.

For this poor chap, known as Jacob, fooling his brain into thinking he was on a roller coaster almost made him vomit.

Wearing a visor so all he can see is the virtual ride and listening to the sound of the clunking tracks, it only takes the first 'climb' on the ride before he begins to look uncomfortable.

Scroll down for video...

As the visuals on the computer screen show the virtual ride approaches its first 'drop', the man tenses up in anticipation

A friend comes in close behind in case he falls from losing his balance

'Did I mention I really don't like roller coasters?' he says as the visuals show the carriage climbing.

As we see the virtual ride approaches its first 'drop', the man tenses up in 
anticipation, and a friend comes in close behind in case he falls.

He then screams, clearly in absolute terror.

His friend, who is filming the whole 
experience, laughs uncontrollably as the virtual roller coaster ride 
sends his friend stumbling backwards.

At one point his knees appear to go and he almost falls to the floor, but is caught by someone stood behind him.

He then falls backwards screaming and is fortunately caught by a friend

Clearly in absolute terror by the whole experience he yells and holds his head, while stumbling

'No, no, no!' he shouts.

Notes and comments on the hilarious 
clip, posted on Youtube.com, reveal the boys are from Mississippi, U.S.,
and were trying out a demo made by a forum member on MTBS3D.

The publisher, 'ibarakiprefecture', says: 'This is not a fake reaction.'

He went on: 'He was drunk, and he 
always acts crazy like this. We were at a fighting game tournament and 
he was drunk and hype. I recorded a bunch of people that day.

'I did this
for fun , because it's interesting to watch different people's 
reactions'

At one point his knees buckle beneath him and he collapses to the ground, clasping his hand over his mouth

Viewers can watch what Jacob's brain thinks he is experiencing on the computer screen.

The publisher goes on to explain that 
not everyone has reacted in the same way; the most extreme reactions are
from those who suffer from motion sickness.

The virtual roller coaster experience 
is less than two minutes long, but Jacob couldn't wait to tear the visor
and ear phones off him.

After screaming and collapsing to the 
floor, he yells: 'Get this off me, get this off me, get this off me,' 
and appears to be retching.

He storms out of the area, saying: 'I'm done'.

Unable to stand up, he shouts for help, yelling, 'Get this off me!'Â 

Traumatised Jacob sits on the floor trying to gain some composure and balance, before storming out
