A top salesman at Lacoste's flagship New York store has claimed that he was fired for posting a picture of his paycheck on Instagram.

Wade Groom, from Brooklyn, New York, told Gothamist that he was merely 'expressing his frustration' with the expensive cost of living in New York, not with Lacoste in particular, when he shared a zoomed-out image of his pay slip.

'I was making as much as $1,500 a week selling shirts, but I'm not able to give my kids a better life, even if I'm working my butt off,' he told the newspaper, explaining that he made $15 an hour and received a three per cent commission during his three months on the job.

Dismissed: Wade Groom, from Brooklyn, New York, has claimed that he was fired from his position as a salesman at Lacoste for posting a picture of his paycheck on Instagram

The post: Just two weeks after his Instagram post, the HR manager informed him that the company was firing him because the image infringed on their confidentiality agreement

According to documents provided to MailOnline by Mr Groom, he was the top salesman at the store, having sold $39,315 worth of merchandise in his most profitable week on the job.

Still, despite his success as a 
'helluva salesman', he found that his wages were not enough to support 
his ex-wife and four-year-old twins in the expensive city of New York.

Just two weeks after he posted the 
image of his paycheck, the HR manager at Lacoste informed him that the 
company was firing him because the photo infringed on 
their confidentiality agreement.

Mr Groom has pointed out that the photo is so zoomed-out that it is impossible to discern the numbers on his paycheck.

Top salesman: One of the documents states that he made $130,449 for Lacoste in June, which was a whopping 92per cent above his sales goal for the month

He also insists Lacoste got the wrong end of the stick when they took his post to be a jab at the company.

'I was happy with my job,' he insisted to Gothamist, adding: '[The photo] had nothing to do with how much money I was making.'

Indeed,
 he explained to Metro that it was 'more sort of an artistic and personal 
statement, like I'm working my ass off and it's only enough to pay for 
my shitty, third-world studio apartment.'

Mr Groom says his job loss has put him in a difficult financial situation, one which he feels was avoidable.

'A stern warning would have been more appropriate,' he told Gothamist.

A spokesperson for Lacoste did not return requests for a comment.
