It wasn't the bridal march she may have had in mind.

Staring back at the camera with a look of resignation, bogus bride Helena Puchalska is frogmarched out of a register office in handcuffs.

Polish Puchalska, 20, arrived for the sham ceremony with Asif Ali, a 31-year-old Pakistani graduate whom she barely knew, in a tight white dress wrapped in a fur coat.

The happiest day of their lives: Polish 'bride' Helena Puchalska and her Pakistani husband-to-be Asif Ali are marched away from their wedding ceremony in handcuffs

Jailed: Puchalska (left) was sentenced to 15 months in prison, while Ali (right) was given two years

But the couple found officers from the UK Border Agency ready to arrest them after being tipped off by a suspicious registrar.

Officers discovered Ali had arrived in
Britain four years earlier to study on a legitimate visa at a London 
university. But the visa had expired.

Northampton Crown Court heard how he 
offered money, believed to be £2,500, to EU citizen Puchalska if she 
married him, which would have allowed him to remain in the UK.

Puchalska, a warehouse worker, was 
jailed for 15 months while Ali, described as the driving force behind 
the deception, was jailed for two years after they admitted conspiring 
to breach immigration laws with their sham wedding.

Sentencing the pair, Judge Richard Bray said the bogus ceremony struck at the 'sanctity of marriage'.

He said: 'You were caught undergoing a sham marriage for the purposes of immigration.

'This
is a serious offence, not only because it breaches our immigration laws
but because of the aggravating feature that it strikes at the sanctity 
of marriage.

Sham: Officers from the UK Border Agency arrested the couple at Northampton Guildhall just as they were about to go through with the ceremony

'Such offences
are still prevalent today as anyone who reads the newspapers knows. 
Sentences of some length are needed for such blatant and cynical 
offending.

'You, Ali, were 
the instigator and had most to gain. You are intelligent and knew 
perfectly well what you were doing. You, Puchalska, went along with this
enterprise for money.'

They claimed to have met in a 
nightclub last March. Ali said they toasted their engagement with vodka –
in honour of Puchalska's Polish heritage.

In December the couple met the 
registrar at Northampton Guildhall  – where they would be arrested the 
next week – to plan the ceremony. The official became suspicious  when 
Ali could not spell his bride-to-be's name and did not know her home 
town.

The only thing he could tell the 
official about his bride's homeland was that it was cold, had forests 
and that soup and ham dominated the national diet.

Joe Spicer, prosecuting, said: 'There was a ceremony planning meeting on December 19 at which the registrar became concerned this wedding did not appear to be genuine.

'She noticed Ali was answering all the questions and the bride appeared to be entirely disinterested in what was to take place. There was also no intimacy or contact between them.'

After the hearing, a UK Border Agency spokesman said: 'As they pleaded guilty, the notes were not subject to handwriting analysis so we cannot say they were definitively written by Ali but it's true to say they were found in the boot of his car.'

Inspector Andy Radcliffe, of the UK Border Agency's Criminal and Financial Investigations team, added: 'This was a marriage of convenience - convenient for Puchalska because it would have lined her pockets and convenient for Ali because it was a means to UK residency.'
