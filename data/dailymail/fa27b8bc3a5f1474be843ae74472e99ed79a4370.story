Britain's first gay weddings will take place on March 29 next year, ministers announced yesterday.

The date is several months earlier than expected - and led to warnings that it could reopen deep Tory divisions over gay marriage in the run-up to next year’s European parliament elections.

But the decision to fast-track the first ceremonies threatens to reopen the controversy over the issue in Tory ranks in the run-up to critical European and local elections in May.

The gay marriage legislation prompted a huge Tory rebellion earlier this year and is blamed by some for accelerating the decline in the party’s membership.
