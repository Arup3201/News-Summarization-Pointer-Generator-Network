Silvio Berlusconi waved and smiled after finishing his first day of community service at a Catholic hospice as a part of a one-year sentence for tax fraud.

His demeanour was in stark contrast to his sombre and silent arrival hours earlier at the Sacra Famiglia centre outside Milan where he is being forced to work on the Alzheimer's ward.

Dressed casually in a jacket but no tie, the former prime minister made no comment as he left his black sedan before being whisked inside accompanied by an administrator.

Just after entering the building, a lone protester from the Cub union yelled that the tycoon should be entering the nearby San Vittore prison instead of performing community service.

Proud of his day's work: Disgraced former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi waves to media after finishing his first day of community service at an Italian hospice

Relaxed: Berlusconi smiles as he gets into a waiting car outside the Sacra Famiglia centre where he is being forced to volunteer on the Alzheimer's ward

Pleased: The former three-time premier is driven off in a black sedan at the end of his community service

Berlusconi, 77, was ordered to perform
 four hours of community service a week for a year after his four-year 
sentence was reduced to one by a general amnesty.

Ignoring
 around 200 Italian and foreign journalists, the billionaire left 
bodyguards outside as he entered the Sacra Famiglia centre, a sprawling 
structure caring for the elderly and mentally ill.

'I
 think all this media attention is excessive, given that he's not coming
 here because he wants to help those suffering from Alzheimer's disease -
 he's here because he was forced to come,' said a volunteer at the 
centre who only gave his name as Mario.

Berlusconi
 has promised surprises during his service - and told private radio on 
Thursday that he has been studying the latest treatments for Alzheimer's
 disease 'to give nurses a way to be able to do more.'

Sombre: Dressed casually in a jacket but no tie, the former prime minister made no comment as he left his black sedan and was escorted inside the Alzheimer's ward of the Sacra Famiglia centre

Engaging: Berlusconi has promised surprises during his service - and said he has been studying the latest treatments for Alzheimer's disease 'to give nurses a way to be able to do more'

Still, Sacra Famiglia's director has 
said his integration into the routine will be much more gradual than 
Berlusconi may imagine, with a period of observation and acclimation 
with the needs of Alzheimer's patients for the initial sessions.

He
 arrives after breakfast during a period of recreation, where caregivers
 assist in activities that can include playing music for the patients.

Lunch follows, but it is unlikely Berlusconi will help feed patients, at least at first.

Then there is a period of rest, during which many patients return to their rooms.

The
 obligation to do community service does not bar Berlusconi, who was 
expelled from Italy's Senate after the conviction, from campaigning for 
his Forza Italia party ahead of European Parliament elections this 
month.

Compassion required: Berlusconi will start after breakfast during a period of recreation, where caregivers assist in activities that can include playing music for the patients

Period of acclimatisation: It is not thought that Berlusconi will help feed the patients, at least not at first

Going it alone: Ignoring around 200 Italian and foreign journalists, the billionaire left bodyguards outside as he entered the Sacra Famiglia centre, a sprawling structure caring for the elderly and mentally ill

Opinion polls suggest Forza Italia 
could command just short of 20 per cent of the vote, making it Italy's 
third largest party after the centre-left Democratic Party led by Prime 
Minister Matteo Renzi and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.

Sabatina
 Carlone, a Berlusconi supporter who came with her husband and 18-month 
nephew in a show of support said: 'We came because we are in love with 
him as a leader.

'This is not justice, it's a mockery. The president (of Italy) should have pardoned him.'

Anger: Just after he was whisked inside, a lone protester from the Cub union yelled that the tycoon should be entering the nearby San Vittore prison instead of performing community service
