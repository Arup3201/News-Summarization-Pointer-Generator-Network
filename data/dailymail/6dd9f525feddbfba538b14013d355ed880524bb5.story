The BBC have decided to put Match of the Day's old London set up for sale and could raise around £10,000 from the auction which will take place in November.

Match of the Day's 70-ft long former backdrop, which was used on the show from 2007 to 2011 before the programme was relocated to Salford, will be among a set of BBC items sold by auctioneers Peaker Pattinson. 

Host Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and former pundit Alan Hansen are just some of the high-profile names who used to sit on MotD's famous sofas on Saturday nights to provide a highlights show of the weekend's Premier League fixtures.

The BBC, including Match of the Day, moved their media base from London to Salford in 2011

Lineker, speaking to The Sun on Sunday, joked that Hansen or Robbie Savage could be in the market for the BBC set.

'Maybe Alan Shearer or Robbie Savage will have a bid or even Mr Hansen if he's feeling nostalgic,' said Lineker.

'Either way this is a chance to get your hands on a little, or rather big, piece of BBC history.'
