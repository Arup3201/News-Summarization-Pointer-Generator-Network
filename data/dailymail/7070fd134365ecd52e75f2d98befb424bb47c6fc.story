The jurors in a Polo millionaire's retrial for DUI manslaughter will not see the two cars at the center of the crash that killed a 23-year-old student, it was today revealed.

John Goodman, 50, was sentenced to 16 years in prison in May 2012 after being convicted of killing Scott Wilson in a drunken hit-and-run in Wellington, Florida, in February 2010.

But a retrial is currently underway after the tycoon's initial conviction was thrown out when a mistrial was declared because of juror misconduct.

Alleged manslaughter: John Goodman (left), 50, was sentenced to 16 years in prison in May 2012 after being convicted of killing student Scott Wilson (right) in a drunken hit-and-run in Wellington, Florida, in 2010

Wrecked: But a retrial is currently underway after the tycoon's initial conviction was thrown out. In the retrial, the jurors will not see the $200,000 Bentley (pictured) that Goodman was driving at the time of the crash

In the case, the new jury will not be shown the $200,000 Bentley that Goodman was driving when he allegedly ran a stop sign and smashed into Mr Wilson's car at speed, sending it into a canal.

They will also not see the Hyundai that the engineering graduate was travelling in when he plummeted into the water and drowned, according to ABC.

This is because officials ordered the release of the two vehicles after Goodman, the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach, was convicted in his first trial. The cars were crushed.

'His car was a crucial piece of evidence in the first case,' said ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams.

'This is a much better case for the defense this time around.' 

Earlier this week, Palm Beach Homicide Detective Troy Snelgrove told the new jury that Goodman appeared inebriated with watery eyes and slurred speech in the hours after the fatal crash.

At the time, the millionaire's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 percent, more than twice the legal driving limit, and he smelt strongly of the substance, he said.

Meanwhile, a local bartender testified that Goodman bought 18 drinks before the crash, including tequila shots and a vodka drink, but said he shared them between friends.

Tragic: Goodman said he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the University of Central Florida graduate (pictured with his mother), who was driving home to Wellington to visit his family at the time

Evidence presented in court showed that the mogul's bill at the venue came to around $272.

However, Goodman's lawyers claimed that he was not driving while drunk, but instead had a drink following the incident to calm his nerves.

During his testimony, Snelgrove also told the court that investigators had recreated the impact of the crash, which saw the 3,600lb Bentley slam into Mr Wilson's much lighter car at 63mph.

If Goodman is convicted again of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide, he faces 16 years in prison

'The vehicle was registered in Texas, which means it had a front license plate on it,' he said, according to Local10.com.

'When the Bentley came through the intersection and struck the Hyundai, it actually left the imprint of the numbers on the license plate on the front wheel.' 

Speaking in the first trial, Goodman claimed his brakes had malfunctioned before the crash. 'I began to apply my brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used to,' he said.

He added that he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the University of Central Florida graduate, who was driving home to Wellington to visit his family at the time.

He told the court that if he had known, he 'would have done whatever I could have done to help'.

In a stunning move in March 2012, Goodman tried to adopt his girlfriend Heather Hutchins, 44, which would have entitled her to a large amount of his children's $300million trust fund.

The adoption papers stated that Ms Hutchins, who has been dating the millionaire since 2009, was entitled to at least a third of his trust, according to the Palm Beach Post.

At the time, Wilsons' attorney, Scott Smith, said Goodman was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets.

A Miami appeals court later ruled that the businessman could not adopt Ms Hutchins.

Goodman's appeal for a retrial was granted after juror Dennis DeMartin, 69, was found guilty of misconduct after not disclosing his ex-wife's DUI during jury selection.

Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts a range of A-list celebrities

'A juror who deceives to get on a jury in a high profile case for his own profit is a trial lawyer's worst nightmare,' Goodman's attorney Roy Black wrote in a statement at the time. 

The new jury was selected in Tampa and brought to West Palm Beach because of the publicity that the high-profile trial attracted initially. Jurors are being kept away in a hotel. 

If Goodman is convicted again of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide, he faces 16 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
