Tragic: Paul Franklin Dart, pictured right with friends, was trying to calm down the gunman when he was shot in the head

The murder case where a homeowner allegedly shot an Army vet dead after he caught the man's relative urinating on his property has now turned into a legal battle over land rights.

James Crocker had grown weary of the partying canoeists and rafters who encroached on his neatly kept property along Missouri's Meramec River.

When he caught Paul Dart Jr. as he was about to relieve himself on a gravel bar by his yard last month, a nasty confrontation ensued that ended with one person dead and Crocker accused of killing him.

The case against Crocker is the latest to put a spotlight on 'castle doctrine' laws, which allow the use of deadly force to protect property.

Missouri is among at least 30 states that have enacted the statutes, which supporters say protect gun rights but others insist promote vigilantism.

Prosecutors interpreted the actions differently, as witnesses who testified at a hearing this month said Crocker was angry and raging, shooting into the crowd of people, narrowly missing two others before killing 48-year-old Paul Dart Jr. of Robertsville.

Crocker, 59, has been charged with second degree murder.

Crocker lives in a small white frame home on a shaded gravel road about eight miles west of Steelville, the self-proclaimed floating capital of the world.

Tens of thousands of people come to the region every year to raft, canoe or kayak down the Meramec and nearby rivers.

Drinking is sometimes part of the outings, resulting in bawdy behavior that doesn't sit well with owners of land that touches the river.

Many have complained for years about loud parties, trash left behind and crude behavior.

On July 20, Dart, a carpenter, and around four dozen other members of an extended family gathered at a campground for their annual float trip along the Meramec.

A few hours into the trip, Robert and Regina Burgess stopped their canoe on a gravel bar.

Robert, who had drunk about three beers, decided to relieve himself, he testified at the preliminary hearing.

Crocker confronted Burgess and other members of the party. When happened then is in dispute, and will be a crucial part of the case.

Burgess said it was only after Dart was shot that members of the party picked up rocks to defend themselves against Crocker, who was armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol.

'I'm standing there unarmed and the guy's got a gun,' Burgess said.

Crocker didn't testify at the hearing, but his attorney gave a different account.

In
 an interview with The Associated Press, Crocker's attorney Michael Bert
 said Crocker politely asked the float trip party to leave.

'The response he got was angry and profane,' Bert said.

Whether
 or not the floaters were on Crocker's property may be an issue in the 
case since Missouri law isn't clear on where private property along a 
waterway begins.

Some experts say it starts at the vegetation line; others say property rights extend to the center of a river or stream.

Missouri's
 castle doctrine statute, enacted in 2007, gives residents a legal right
 to defend themselves and their property against intruders.

Supporters
 of such laws cite a number of cases in which homeowners were able to 
fend off burglars or other criminals without fear of prosecution.

But
 Florida's law gained notoriety after a neighborhood watch activist, 
George Zimmerman, fatally shot teen Trayvon Martin, and was acquitted of
 criminal charges.

The laws in Missouri are extremely vague about property rights along streams and rivers and who can legally access them
