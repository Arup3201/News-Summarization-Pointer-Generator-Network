New York Giant's wide receiver Odell Beckham Jnr. has been hitting the headlines again as he played a part in inciting a mass brawl when his side met the St. Louis Rams on Sunday night.  

A particularly feisty affair, things finally hit boiling point in the second quarter when St. Louis linebacker Alec Ogletree made a rather over-zealous out of bounds tackle on New York's Beckham Jnr. 

In an act of retaliation, the Giants man lashed out at Ogletree with a swiping kick to the legs.

What followed was a hostile sideline fracas, leading to four ejections from the Edward Jones Dome pitch.

Giants wide receiver Preston Parker was given his marching orders for throwing a punch during the melee.

Also on the list of dismissals were Parker's team-mates Johnathan Hankins and Damontre Moore and Rams tackle William Hayes.
