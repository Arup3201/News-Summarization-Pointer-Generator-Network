Waiting times for A&E patients are at their highest point for nearly a decade, a report has warned.

The NHS is under ‘severe strain’ triggered by the crisis in out-of-hours care and casualty departments, according to the influential King’s Fund.

More than 300,000 patients waited for four hours or longer during the first three months of this year – nearly 6 per cent of all patients.

That figure is the highest since 2004 and breaches the Government’s target which states that no more than 5 per cent of patients should be kept waiting more than four hours.

The latest disastrous milestone is further evidence that many A&E departments are struggling to cope with a surge in patient numbers.

Chaos in out-of-hours care and the botched launch of the Government’s 111 non-emergency number have been accused of pushing many hospitals to breaking point, with senior A&E doctors warning they can no longer guarantee safe care for patients.

John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, said emergency care acts as a barometer for the NHS

Other figures show how the crisis in emergency care is having a knock-on effect through the NHS.

The number of cancelled operations has reached a nine-year high, with almost 20,000 planned operations scrapped at the last minute in the first three months of the year – none of them for clinical reasons.

Urgent operations have also been hit – with twice as many cancellations in April 2013 as the same month last year – as over-stretched A&E units admit rising numbers of patients to hospital.

But they are filling beds that would otherwise have been used for surgical patients, forcing surgeons to cancel operations.

The monitoring report from The King’s Fund, a health policy think-tank, showed between January and March 5.9 per cent of patients (313,000 people) waited for four hours or longer in A&E.

It is an increase of more than a third on the previous three months, and of nearly 40 per cent since the same quarter the previous year.

It is barely two years since the Prime Minister pledged to keep A&E waiting times low in June 2011.

John Appleby, chief economist at the King’s Fund, said: ‘Emergency care acts as a barometer for the NHS.

The worryingly high number of patients waiting longer than four hours in the last quarter of 2012-13 is a clear warning sign that the health system is under severe strain.

‘The pressures in emergency care will not be relieved by focusing on a single aspect of the problem  in isolation – it requires a co- ordinated response across the whole health system.’

The King’s Fund also found a rise of 7 per cent in patients waiting more than four hours before being admitted to hospital from A&E, the highest level since 2004.

There has also been a rise in ambulances queuing to get patients into A&E. Although waiting times appear to have declined slightly since April, the King’s Fund is warning that similar pressures next winter could spark a renewed crisis.

The Government has set up an urgent care review under Sir Bruce Keogh and is ‘freeing up’ money to improve A&E services. A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The most recent statistics show that for the fifth week in a row we are meeting the A&E four-hour target.’
