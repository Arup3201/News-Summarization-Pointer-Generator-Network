Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe. 

Starting in Spain, their publications focus on the national team's 4-0 win against Luxembourg in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday.

Goals from David Silva, Paco Alcacer, Diego Costa and Juan Bernat mean Vicente Del Bosque's side sit second in Group C - three points behind Slovakia.

AS leads with the headline 'At last!' in recognition of Costa's strike -  his first for Spain since making his international debut. 

Pressure on the 26-year-old to break his goalscoring duck had been mounting and the paper adds that Costa has taken the weight off his shoulders with that effort. 

Elsewhere, Real Madrid summer signing Toni Kroos has hailed team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo as the best player in the world at present. 

Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, who Kroos also describes as 'very good-looking', has been in sparkling form for Real this season scoring 17 goals in 11 appearances in all competitions so far.

Over in Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport leads with an exclusive interview with AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi who promises that the club will return to its former glory days soon.

The 78-year-old also reveals that the club bought Mario Balotelli against his advice in January 2013 for £19million from Manchester City.

Additionally the fallout of Juventus' controversial 3-2 victory against Roma in Serie A before the international break, continues to rumble on with Gianluigi Buffon blasting Francesco Totti.

In Corriere dello Sport, Buffon accuses the Roma captain for having sour grapes after his side's defeat in Turin and that his persistent grumbles over the result are damaging football.

Finally in France, L'Equipe lavish praise on defender Raphael Varane after his performance in their friendly against Portugal on Saturday with the headline 'Gifted'.

The 21-year-old enjoyed a fine outing in the heart of the France defence, keeping club team-mate Ronaldo at bay, as the Euro 2016 hosts won 2-1.
