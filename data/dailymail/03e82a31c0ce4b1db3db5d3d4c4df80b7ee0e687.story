Ukraine's acting interior minister has disbanded a brutal riot police unit that many accuse of attacking protesters.

Arsen Avakov wrote on his Facebook page that he has signed a decree to disband the force known as Berkut.

Anti-government protesters have blamed Berkut for violent attacks against peaceful demonstrators which left more than 80 people dead in just a few days.

Arsen Avakov has disbanded a riot police force accused of killing and beating protesters during Ukraine's uprising. Last night people lit candles and laid flowers to remember the dead

Yesterday in the city of Lviv members of the same unit were forced to knee on a stage and beg for forgiveness

The news comes just a day after members of the same unit were forced to kneel on a stage in front of protesters and beg for forgiveness in the city of Lviv.

The riot police in Ukraine fell to their knees to ask for forgiveness for their colleagues who shot and beat protesters in the recent Kiev massacre.

'I am asking you to forgive us,' said an
 officer who stood in front of other men. In memory of those who were 
killed, we want to kneel down.'

The officers were greeted with chants of
 'Shame!' and 'Tribunal' but they stressed they had not killed or beaten
 people themselves.

The officers told locals that they did not beat protesters, during a rally in central Lviv

It was also revealed that some Berkut riot police personnel have disappeared along with weapons.

Mr Avakov said the officers were alarmed at the prospect of an investigation into their conduct on Independence Square when dozens of protesters were killed last week.Â 

Following the bloody clashes between 
police and protesters, president Viktor Yanukovych fled the capital Kiev
 and an interim government has now been established.

Mr Avakov said: 'We have difficulties with the Berkut units which have been left without leadership.

'Their leadership have fled, that is why today's check up has shown that 35 persons are not at their subunit's base. This is a problem.'

In contrast, returning Berkut police in Odessa and Crimea have been cheered by crowds waving Russian flags, highlighting the deep divisions in the country.

Many of them carried batons and wore masks.

In Odessa, the commander of the Berkut battalion came to the crowd and shook people's hands. He asked the crowd to remain peaceful and keep public order.
