A Sydney mother who alleges she was assaulted in last month's counter-terrorism raids said she is 'shell-shocked' weeks after the incident.

The woman's south-western Sydney home were among many searched by NSW and Federal police in the nation's largest ever counter-terrorism raids on September 18.

The mother, who refuses to be identified, will this week launch a lawsuit alleging her family were unfairly targeted and faced brutal police conduct in the raids.

According to a Fairfax Media report, the family will allege that a mother-of-two was assaulted by police when their home was raided on September 18 and was unable to cover herself.  

Two teenage boys, aged 15 and 14, were handcuffed, the report said.  

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, family lawyer Zali Burrows said: 'The mother is shell-shocked and instructs that she is afraid to be uncovered and fears being humiliated and seen naked again. 

'She hates her bedroom, refuses to go bed until very late at night and resorts to sleeping in her niqab. 

'She is a virtual prisoner in the niqab (a form of Islamic dress) as her home is no longer her sanctuary.'  

No one at the home, understood to be in Sydney's south-west, was detained or charged.  

Fairfax quoted her eldest son saying: 'Every time I go to bed I'm afraid that I will wake up at 4.30am with police over my head and handcuffs on my hands.'

Ms Burrows said further details about the incident will be available when a statement of claim is lodged in the NSW Supreme Court later this week.  

Only one person, Omarjan Azari, 22, was charged with terrorism offences following the country's biggest counter-terrorism raids ever, which involved more than 800 police officers in NSW alone.

Police raided properties in Beecroft, Bellavista, Guildford, Merrylands, Northmead, Wentworthville, Marsfield, Westmead, Castle Hill, Revesby, Bass Hill and Regents Park. 

On Thursday, September 18, a series of pre-dawn raids were carried out in what was later declared Australia's largest ever counter-terrorism operation.
