A Mickey Mouse loving couple visited a total of three Disney theme parks in one day, taking them on an incredible whistle stop tour of the globe.

Michael, 49, and Diane Greening, 51, from San Diego, spent 28 hours travelling  7,900-miles to Tokyo, California and Orlando. 

Beginning at 9.50am in Tokyo Disneyland, the pair, who celebrate their wedding anniversary at the theme park every year, managed a quick snap in front of Sleeping Beauty castle, then boarded a 10-hour flight to Los Angeles.

They had struggled to decide between visiting Tokyo Disneyland and Walt Disney World, in Florida, so they chose to do both - stopping at Disneyland, in California, in between.

The mission could only be accomplished on days when the Magic Kingdom in Orlando was open until midnight.

And even though they arrived in Florida an hour later than expected, the Greenings reached Disneyland just after noon, posed for a picture and raced to Orange County's John Wayne Airport.

But tension mounted when they missed their flight to Florida and the pair thought they'd never make it in time to see all three parks. 

Thankfully they were ushered onto the next available flight and made it to Disney World, Florida at 11.40pm - just twenty minutes before their deadline.

'Exhausted': Michael Greening tweeted about the adventure, telling friends it was 'fun but really insane'

Despite the travel time being 28 hours - Tokyo is 14 hours behind Florida, which meant that technically, they visited all three parks in a day.

'The best thing was doing it with my wife and best friend,' Michael Greening wrote on Twitter. 'Having her by my side for the whole thing made it special.' 

'It's completely insane, and that's why we did it,' Michael told the New York Daily News.
