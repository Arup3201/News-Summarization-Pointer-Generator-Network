An expansive replica of the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave is scheduled to open to the public next month in France.

The original Chauvet Cave is famous for its 36,000-year-old art, which dates back to prehistoric times and is believed to be the oldest in the world.

In order to recreate the cave and its drawings with accuracy, 3-D modelling was used and some 6,000 digital images were overlapped in developing sketches.

In total, £45million ($67million) has been spent to create the replica cave complex, which is situated inside a larger educational exhibition.

Located one and a half miles from the original caves, construction began on the project in 2012 and is finally expected to be completed by April.

The Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave, discovered in 1994, is the length of two-and-a-half football fields and covers 68,000 square feet.

Its five enormous chambers are not replicated to exact original proportions, but greater focus is given to highlighting the cave's impressive prehistoric art.

The original cave, with its drawings of mammoths and footprints, was inscribed on Unesco's World Heritage list in 2010

The cave, with its drawings of mammoths, human footprints and other carvings, was inscribed on Unesco's World Heritage list several years ago.

According to the UN cultural agency, the decorated caves contain some of the best preserved figurative drawings in the world.

Experts have found more than 1,000 images on the walls of the cave, which is also known as the Grotte Chauvet-Pont d'Arc, after being discovered by researcher Jean-Marie Chauvet in the Ardeche region.

The original cave has five enormous chambers, but the replica focuses more on highlighting the cave's prehistoric art

In 2011, the caves became the subject of a 3D documentary by German filmmaker, Werner Herzog, called Cave of Forgotten Dreams

The drawings are especially interesting because they suggest that the tribes who came from Africa to Europe may have brought language

Researchers discovered 26 signs, drawn in the same style, which appear again and again across the cave's interiors

Experts believe that such repetitive signs are actually an early attempt at communicating through writing

In 2011, the caves became the subject of a 3D documentary by German filmmaker, Werner Herzog, called Cave of Forgotten Dreams.

The drawings suggest that tribes who came to Europe from Africa could have actually brought 'language' with them.

Twenty-six signs, drawn in the same style, appeared again and again, which led researchers to believe that they may have discovered some of the very first attempts to communicate through writing.
