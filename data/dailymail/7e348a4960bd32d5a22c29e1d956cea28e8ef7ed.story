It's that special skill all mothers have and none would want to throw away - the ability to embarrass their children in front of their friends.

And it turns out elephants are no different.

This female Asian elephant wrapped her trunk around her calf and planted what looked to be a big kiss right on its head.

The mother and her child were snapped tangled in each other's trunks sharing a cuddle at an elephant orphanage in Pinnawela, Sri Lanka, proving that even elephants enjoy nothing more than a loving snuggle.

Loving: The tender moments of affections were caught at an elephant orphanage in Pinnawela, Sri Lanka

It was captured by Ukranian amateur photographer Koziuk Vladimir, 39, who managed to catch the embrace by chance.

The artist headed off to Sri Lanka on a family holiday but couldn't resist the opportunity to get his Canon EOS-1Ds mark III camera out and capture the cuddle.

After the embrace, the duo took off and joined the rest of the herd to cool off in the river.

The amateur photographer took to photography when he was just 10 years old but has never come across anything like this before.

Friendships: Elephants are able to maintain strong friendships even with those they have not seen in a year or more

He said: 'It was amazing to be able to witness this moment because until I visited the centre I've never seen anything so dramatic between animals.

'The orphanage centre must be doing really great work because all the elephants seemed happy.

'In the time I spent there I managed to watch lots of elephants cuddle up to each other which is such a special sight.

'It was a privilege to visit the orphanage because they take care of lots of injured elephants.

'It's reassuring to know that the injured animals get a safe place to live where they're properly cared for instead of being in the wild where they may come under threat.
