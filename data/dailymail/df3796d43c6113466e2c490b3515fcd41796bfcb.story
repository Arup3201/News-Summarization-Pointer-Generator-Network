From deadly flu viruses to a car crash, some of its lead characters have met grisly ends.

So Downton Abbey’s cast must have been relieved to learn they will all survive the next series.

After viewers complained about the ITV drama’s high body count, scriptwriter Julian Fellowes decided not to kill off any major characters in the fifth series, which begins this autumn.

Actress Lesley Nicol, 61, who stars as Mrs Patmore the cook, said there had been a particularly ‘big fuss’ about the death in a car crash of Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens, in the 2012 Christmas special.

She added: ‘There aren’t any plans for any big characters to die this year.

‘I think it would be very unwise to do any more deaths because the viewers don’t like them.’

In 2012, some viewers complained Downton had ruined their Christmas after Mr Crawley, played by Dan Stevens – was killed in a shock car crash.

In the next series heiress Lady Sybil - played by Jessica Brown-Findlay – passed away in a fit of convulsions during childbirth as her family wept by her bedside.

Previous episodes have seen young fiancée Lavinia Swire succumb to a deadly flu virus, footman William Mason die in the Battle of the Somme, valet Mr Green die in mysterious circumstances on a London street and Turkish diplomat Kemal Pamuk suffer a fatal heart attack.

Another shocking plotline, showing the rape of ladies maid Anna Bates last year, prompted more than 400 complaints and was criticised by rape campaigners.

But Miss Nicol has reassured fans that even its oldest character, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by 79-year-old Maggie Smith, will survive the fifth series.

She said: Dame Maggie is in it a lot this year. Don’t worry, she’s in it plenty.’

Filming on the next series is expected to finish in August before it screens in the autumn.

However, Miss Nicol warned the series will not continue forever.

She said: ‘I don’t know how long it will last. I know it won’t go on years and years. Julian wants to do other things and he will also want to go out on a high, as we all do.’

Series producer Liz Trubridge has said she is ‘very conscious’ of the effect the slew of deaths has had on viewers but insisted Mr Crawley’s untimely end was unavoidable as Mr Stevens wanted to leave the show.

Lord Fellowes joked he even needed to be protected against furious fans after the traumatic episode. He said: ‘I was afraid to go out without bodyguards.

'I was very interested by that. People don’t understand that we’re not in control of that kind of stuff, if an actor wants to leave the show. We did get an absolute barrage of criticism for that.

‘It’s calmed down a bit now, actually, but I don’t know. What I’m always rather touched by is the way these people become real to the audience.’
