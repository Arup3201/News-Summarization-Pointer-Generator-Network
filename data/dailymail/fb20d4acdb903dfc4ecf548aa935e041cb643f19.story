TLC's My Strange Addiction returns to screens this evening, this time offering a unique insight into the lives of two British woman, one  who is addicted to eating bricks another who is obsessed with Pamela Anderson, and an American who is married to a carnival ride 

Since the age of 17, Patrice, who is now 29, has consumed more than half a ton of bricks, having first been introduced to the bizarre snack idea by her grandmother. 

'I started eating brick in my late teens,' the Londoner explains in the show. 'I got the idea to do it from my grandma who told me that my auntie and uncle, when they were kids, used to dig the wall and taste it.

'I just can't stop': Patrice, 29, has been eating brick since the age of 17

True romance: Linda, 56, has been married to Bruce - a carnival ride - for the past three years

Carolyn, 29, is obsessed with Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and makes a living impersonating her

'One day I ended up trying it myself - and I couldn't really stop.'

Patrice has not gone one single day in the past 12 years without consuming brick, and has even chewed a two-foot hole in her bedroom in order to feed her addiction. 

'You can just hear her going into town going crunch, crunch, crunch,' her husband Calvin reveals. 'You get this cringe feeling when you hear it. 

'But obviously to Patrice, it's heaven.' 

Her addiction is now so severe that Patrice likens herself to a drug addict; not a minute goes by when she is not thinking about where she can find her next fix, a problem which she believes is made even worse by the wide range of brick structures that surround her home in London.

'London is full of brick,' she says. 'The Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, the roads. Brick is everywhere. I'm having this constant reminder of brick, brick, brick. 

Obsessed: Patrice's addiction has become so severe that she is unable to go even a day without eating brick - and she regularly tears holes in her walls in order to feed her addiction

Family affair: The Londoner was first inspired to eat bricks after her grandmother revealed that her aunt and uncle had tried it as children

'It's always at the back of my mind, I've always got to have it, I've always got to go and get it. 

'When I eat brick, it's like a drug to a drug addict. You feel good for a while - until you need it again.' 

But while Patrice's bizarre addiction has not prevented her from enjoying a relatively normal life, including what seems to be a close bond with her husband, her Strange Addiction co-star Linda hasn't managed to balance her own obsession in quite the same way. 

The 56-year-old is an object-sexual, meaning that she has romantic feelings towards inanimate objects.

Linda has been married to 'Bruce', a 70-ton carnival ride, for the past three years, and has previously enjoyed relationships with both a locomotive and an airplane. 

'Some women like tall men, some women like men with a colorful personality, he's got all of that,' she explains,

'To me, Bruce is just amazing when he stands up and is spread out.'

Must be love: Linda stores Bruce in a trailer in her garden, and frequently spends the night in there herself

Dinner for two: The pair often share candlelit dinners together in their trailer

Linda stores Bruce on her property; his main structure, which she enjoys climbing, is kept outside, while the cars that form the rest of the ride are stored in a trailer. 

'I love being in here,' she says of the trailer, which also contains a bunk bed where Linda sleeps when she wants to spend the night with Bruce.

'I usually set up a table and have a candlelight dinner. It's really nice being in here with him. 

'And I can have more closer moments with him than with the main load outside and all my neighbors staring in the yard. You do want that closed doors scene.'

But she insists that sexuality is not the basis for her relationship with Bruce, but rather her intimate and romantic feelings towards the metal structure. 

'It's the feeling in my heart, it's a love affair between flesh and steel,' she explains. 'We're just an old couple. We're a sweet old couple.' 

Carolyn, 29 from Liverpool has spent $40,000 on procedures to look more like her idol Pamela Anderson

During the episode producers fly Carolyn to LA to visit the beach where Baywatch was filmed

While Linda is hopelessly devoted to her fairground ride, another Strange Addiction star has found her self utterly devoted to one blonde actress.

Carolyn, 29, from Liverpool, is a British Pamela Anderson impersonator, dubbing herself the 'Scouse Pammie' and her obsession with the star has reached striking levels.

In the program, Carolyn reveals that over the years has spent $40,000 on procedures including Botox, a boob job, chemical peels, lip injections, lip tattooing and hair extensions, to make herself look more like her idol and a further $160,000 on clothes, a process she calls: 'The manifestation of my Pammification.'

During the program Carolyn meets Baywatch star Alexandra Paul who compliments her on her boob job

As well as cosmetic surgery Carolyn has changed her name to Anderson, a process she calls Pammification

Carolyn, who has even changed her surname to Anderson, and makes a living as a Pam impersonator but had always dreamed of going to Hollywood. 

The episode sees the producers of My Strange Addiction arrange for the mega fan to fly to Los Angeles to live out her life as the Baywatch star.

While there, the 29-year-old dons a red bathing suit and run along the beach where Baywatch was filmed She also meets Baywatch star Alexandra Paul for lunch who admitted it was 'odd' to meet someone who impersonated a friend.

Despite her first doubts about Carolyn, Alexandra complements her on her boob job and then refers her to a casting agent. 

Carolyn went in for an open audition but the casting agent struggled with her Scouse accent and her 'Scouse Pammie' alter ego and told her she might have a chance as an actress if she was just herself.

But Carolyn told the cameras: 'Scouse Pammie is who I am, if I stop being Scouse Pammie part of me would die. I will never stop tweaking myself, I will never stop enhancing or improving myself.'
