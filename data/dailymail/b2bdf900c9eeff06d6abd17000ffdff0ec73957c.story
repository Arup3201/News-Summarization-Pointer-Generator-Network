She's previously been named the Sexiest Woman Alive by Men’s Health magazine, FITNESS magazine hailed her 'most wanted body' of the year and leading plastic surgeons say that more patients demand her look over any other celebrity but even Jennifer Aniston isn't comfortable in her own skin.

The 45-year-old is reportedly so paranoid about sagging skin around her arms that she is considering having brachioplasty - or 'batwing surgery' as it is dubbed in Tinseltown.

A source told Grazia's Joe Stone: 'Jen seems really bothered about the folds of skin around her armpits. She's put on a bit of weight for her latest role in Cake and apparently feels self-conscious wearing sleeveless tops.'

Insecure: Jennifer Aniston is reportedly so paranoid about sagging skin around her arms that she is considering having brachioplasty, a procedure which removes 'bingo wings'

Unlike Kim Kardashian and Simon Cowell, who have openly admitted to having treatments such as vampire facelifts, Botox and sheep placenta facials, Jennifer is reportedly so paranoid about getting caught out, she sneaks off for consultations in the middle of the night.

The source added: 'She'll have the operation at 4am to avoid photographers, which is her usual tactic.'

Speaking about the £5,000 treatment, Dr. Yannis Alexandrides, MD of 111 Harley Street, who offers a similar procedure, said: 'A brachioplasty procedure targets the upper arm, an area more commonly known as "bingo wings".

'Despite a regimented fitness regime and healthy diet, it’s not unusual to develop excess skin and fatty tissue on the upper arms as with age, and in some cases rapid weight loss, skin loses vital elasticity that keeps the arms taut and toned.

Excess skin can potentially be pulled up and tucked into the armpit with an axillary brachioplasty or mini arm tuck

'There are two types of brachioplasty procedures that can be performed, and this depends upon the amount excess skin and concentration of fat.

If excess hanging skin is located and limited to within a couple of inches from the armpit, then this excess skin can potentially be pulled up and tucked into the armpit with an axillary brachioplasty or mini arm tuck.

'For patients who have excess skin that extends from the armpit to the elbow, the best option is to completely remove the excess arm fat and skin.'

And it isn't just her arms that Jennifer is paranoid about.

When she shot to fame as Rachel Green in hit sitcom Friends, the defining hairstyle of the Nineties was born.

Hard to tame: The 45-year-old, pictured right as Rachel Green in Friends, may have the most famous locks in the world but she maintains that her hair is exceptionally difficult to manage

Aniston's
 locks - which quickly became known as 'The Rachel' - were the envy of 
women worldwide and one of the most popular hairstyle requests of all 
time but she doesn't even like her own locks and finds them hard to manage.

Speaking to The Metro, she said: 'The thing that makes me chuckle is when I hear that my hair is so this, or so that.

'My hair is always at odds with a brush and a hairdryer. To get my hair straight can be a struggle.'

Jennifer is reportedly a huge fan of the
Honestly Healthy Alkaline Programme, which involves eating

Jennifer is reportedly a huge fan of the Honestly Healthy Alkaline Programme and does lots of yoga

predominantly alkaline foods in an effort to keep the body’s pH between 
7.35 and 7.45. The regime is supposed to heal a variety of ailments in 
addition to aiding weight loss.

Jennifer, 44, is the latest star to try the diet, other fans include 
Gwyneth Paltrow, Victoria Beckham and Kirsten 
Dunst.

The ultra-strict regime warns against
‘acid-forming’ foods such as starchy grains, vegetables such as 
pasta, wheat and beans, all dairy products, meat, fish and shellfish. Also banned are tea, coffee, sugar, fizzy drinks including soda and tonic water, and of course, alcohol.

The star is also said to be an ardent fan of a £5 'wonder' smoothie - and drinks nothing else on one day every week, usually a Saturday.

A
source told Grazia: 'The drink is made up of fresh, organic vegetables.
Beetroot, cucumbers, spinach, garlic, carrots, celery and kale.'

As
 for exercise, Jennifer is said to have been working with yoga teacher 
and 'wellness advisor' Mandy Ingber for three to four days a week since 
2005.

The duo use a combination of yoga, spinning, and toners to get in shape.

'Part
 of why Jennifer looks so awesome is her balance. She's a balance of 
having strength, being toned, and being lean - beautiful but natural,' 
Ingber told InStyle.

'She
 works hard, but you also see her taking care of herself. She's a career
 woman and a relationship person. We should have balance in all aspects 
of our lives! Always address all aspects of who you are.'

And
 what about that glowing skin? Grazia have reported that the actress is 
hooked on 'baby face drips', a drip that pumps her with anti-ageing 
ingredients at West Hollywood clinic once a week.
