A woman claims she saw Gary Glitter - seen on Jim'll Fix It in 1991 - having sex with an underage girl in host Jimmy Savile's dressing room

Gary Glitter raped a girl of 13 in Sir Jimmy Savile’s BBC dressing room, it was claimed last night.

The attack in the 1970s allegedly took place as Savile was himself groping a 14-year-old in the same room.

A third star – a household-name entertainer who still performs – was also abusing a schoolgirl, according to the claims.

They were made by Karin Ward, a former pupil of the Surrey school where Savile is accused of preying on under-age girls.

She waived her anonymity to tell an ITV documentary screened last night how the Jim’ll Fix It star was in cahoots with pop paedophile Glitter.

Her devastating story was aired as:

Mrs Ward said her abuse happened when, aged 14, she and two fellow pupils of Duncroft boarding school for ‘intelligent, emotionally disturbed girls’ in Surrey were invited to London by Savile.

She told ITV News the three vulnerable girls were taken to Savile’s dressing room at BBC Television Centre. She recalled: ‘I saw Gary Glitter have sex with a girl in Jimmy Savile’s dressing room...in that little alcove bit. I didn’t see it completely but that’s what was going on and nobody batted an eyelid.

‘Jimmy Savile had a [14-year-old] girl on his lap and he had his hand up her skirt. The girl Gary Glitter was having sex with also came from Duncroft. I think she might have been not quite 14.’

She said the third star – a well-known entertainer  – tried to grope her. ‘It frightened me and freaked me out,’ said Mrs Ward.

‘He humiliated me in front of everyone in the dressing room by saying something really unkind about my lack of breasts.’

Her testimony comes after more than ten other women stepped forward earlier in the week to allege the Top of the Pops presenter abused them when they were children. Savile, who died aged 84 last October, was never charged even though at least five police forces have been investigating claims against him.

Yesterday Glitter – real name Paul Gadd – said ‘go away’ when asked about the allegations at his flat in Central London. Asked if ‘had sex with a girl’ in Savile’s dressing room, he said: ‘Absolutely no. Thank you and goodbye.’

At the home of the third star, there was no answer yesterday, but he fiercely denied Mrs Ward’s claims via his agent.

Glitter was jailed for four months in 1999 for downloading images of children being abused. In 2008 he was jailed in Vietnam for assaulting two girls aged ten and 11.

Savile later defended him by saying Glitter just watched a few ‘dodgy films’ for his ‘own gratification’.

The BBC has been forced to launch an inquiry in conjunction with police into Savile’s alleged four-decade reign of abuse.

     A memorial outside the former home of 
Jimmy Savile was yesterday attacked by vandals who scrawled 'paedophile'
 and 'rapist' across the golden plaque.

Residents
 of Wessex Court in Scarborough threatened to pull down the 'bling' 
plaque themselves to stop the building being targeted.

One said: 'Some people wanted to take a sledge hammer to it when all this blew up.'

The Scarborough Civic Society plaque records in gold lettering that Savile 'entertainer and philanthropist' lived here.

He is said to have exploited his BBC fame to molest and rape children as young as nine, confident that his star status at the corporation made him ‘untouchable’.

A Newsnight report into Savile’s alleged crimes was controversially shelved, and last night Mrs Ward – who initially gave her story of abuse to BBC reporters – said she was appalled at the way she was treated, being informed by a brief text message that the programme was not going ahead.

She said the corporation should have at least ‘gone to the police’ with the information, although it is understood she herself had not reported it either.

Last night a Newsnight spokesman said: ‘We believed the allegation being made about Mr Glitter was already known to the police.

‘We are sorry for any disappointment felt by Karin and other contributors by not broadcasting their stories. Ultimately the BBC decided it could not reach the standard of proof required for our investigation so the film was not finished and not broadcast. For example, we could not identify or trace Gary Glitter’s alleged victim.’

Yesterday it was claimed Savile molested girls as young as nine during charity visits to the Haut de la Garenne children’s home in Jersey where abuse was rife during the 1970s and 1980s.

A woman who used to live in the home and was 11 at the time told how the star abused her and her nine-year-old sister in 1971. She said: ‘When I reported the abuse, it was brushed it under the carpet.’
