Culture Secretary Maria Miller apologised to the Commons in a 30-second statement

Culture Secretary Maria Miller today delivered a blunt, 30-second apology after being ordered to repay £5,800 in expenses.

An investigation by the Commons standards 
watchdog found she had overclaimed on mortgage bills in 2008-09, and the money must be returned.

The watchdog spent almost 18 months investigating her use of the 
taxpayer-funded second home allowance and accused her of not cooperating with its questions.

David Cameron insisted Mrs Miller has his 'very strong and very warm support' amid suggestions from some Tory MPs that she is being given an ‘easy 
ride’ because of the shortage of women in the Cabinet.

In her short statement to the Commons at Midday, Mrs Miller stressed the allegation that the taxpayer funded her parents' living costs had been 'dismissed'.

But she added: 'The committee did recommend that I apologise to the House for my attitude to the commissioner's inquiry and I of course unreservedly apologise.

'I fully accept the recommendations of the committee and thank them for bringing this matter to an end.'

She is the first serving Cabinet minister to have to apology to Parliament over expenses.

But Mr Cameron insisted she would remain in government. The PM said: 'Maria Miller is doing an excellent job as Culture Secretary and will continue to do that.

'If we look at this report, yes, of course these issues do matter but she was cleared of the original allegation made against her.

'An over-payment was found which she is going to pay back and she'll make a full apology and I think people should leave it at that.'

Over-claiming: Culture secretary Maria Miller is expected to be cleared on the charge of abusing allowances to help fund a second property in Wimbledon, south west London, which she bought for £234,000 in 1995

One
 long-serving MP said: ‘No. 10 is so obsessed with the idea it has a 
“women problem” that it stuffs the front bench at Prime Minister’s 
Questions with women ministers, however junior, week after week. So 
Cameron won’t be prepared to lose Maria Miller.’

Mrs
 Miller has been cleared on the central charge 
of abusing Commons allowances to help fund a second property in 
Wimbledon, south west London, where her elderly parents were living.

But
 she has been told to repay £5,800 in excess claims for mortgage costs in 2008-09 that
 emerged during the course of the investigation by the Commons standards
 committee.

A well-placed 
source yesterday said the sum relates to the fact that Mrs Miller simply
 ‘forgot to make the right adjustments’ in her mortgage claims when 
interest rates fell.

Censure: Taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage. In all she claimed £90,000 over four years for the property which was near her parents' home

More 
damagingly, Mrs Miller was also criticsed for a failure to cooperate with the inquiry.

Kathryn Hudson, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, said: 'Throughout my inquiry it has been difficult to establish information and evidence to the standard of proof which I would have wished.

'It has also been difficult to find evidence to corroborate information provided by Mrs Miller.

'Many of her responses to my questions have been very general and required repeated probing.'

Basingstoke MP Mrs Miller, a former advertising 
executive, made claims totalling £90,718 on the Wimbledon property 
between 2005 and 2009, but stopped after the MPs’ expenses scandal 
broke.

New rules banning 
parents sharing a property funded by the taxpayer were introduced that 
year after Labour’s Tony McNulty resigned as a minister over  the 
matter.

Mrs Miller has previously struggled to explain why she suddenly 
stopped claiming on the Wimbledon property as the expenses controversy 
erupted.

But she insists the 
claims were ‘entirely above board’ and that they had been ‘audited twice
 independently’.

She has also denied using her position overseeing the 
Leveson reforms of the Press to warn off a newspaper that was 
investigating her expenses.

She
 said she complained because her disabled father was ‘doorstepped’ by a 
journalist, but denied that she linked her complaint to the setting up 
of a new independent press regulator.

An
 ally of Mrs Miller said yesterday: ‘The central allegation that was 
made by a Labour MP and the commissioner has been investigating we 
expect it to be dismissed.

The
 suggestion that Mrs Miller is being treated with kid gloves by Downing 
Street because of her sex is ‘ridiculous and untrue’, the ally added.

Another Conservative MP said the Prime Minister would be ‘loath’ to get 
rid of her, especially if the complaint came from Labour.

A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron still had confidence in the Culture Secretary.

Maria Miller's rented cottage in Hampshire

Maria Miller made more than £1.2million on the London home she shared with her parents after it was sold on Valentine’s Day for £1.47million.

The Culture Secretary bought the Wimbledon property with her solicitor husband Iain for just £234,000 in 1995 – while she still worked as an executive for London agency Grey Advertising.

Taxpayers have been billed for the interest on the mortgage for four years from 2005 – the year the mother of three became MP for Basingstoke – because Mrs Miller designated it as her second home.

But because her family lived there, questions were raised over whether the Wimbledon property was genuinely a second home – and not the rented cottage in her Hampshire constituency that she had designated as her main residence.

Mrs Miller was appointed Culture Secretary and minister for women and equality in a 2012 Cabinet reshuffle.

The 50-year-old’s clients during her spell in advertising included Mars and she also worked for PR company Rowland, which was owned by Saatchi & Saatchi.
