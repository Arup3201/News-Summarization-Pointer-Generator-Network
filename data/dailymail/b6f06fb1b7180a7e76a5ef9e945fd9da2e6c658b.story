David Moyes' failure to deliver Champions League football at Manchester United has directly benefited their rivals City, who as a result have jumped into the advantageous pot two.

United, AC Milan and Inter will all have no involvement next season, which sees City rise to the second group of seeds. 

The Italian giants and United all boast 
higher UEFA coefficients than City, meaning Manuel Pellegrini's side - as well as Andre Villas-Boas' Zenit - move up a pot by virtue of the big three's absence, noticeably enhancing their chances.

All smiles! Manchester City will be in pot two for next season's Champions League group stage draw

Cheers! City were aided after Manchester United's disastrous campaign under ex-boss David Moyes

Pot one: Porto*

Pot two: MANCHESTER CITY

Pot three: CSKA Moscow

Pot four: Anderlecht

Pot one: Real Madrid

Pot two: MANCHESTER CITY

Pot three: Ajax

Pot four: Roma

* assumes that team progresses through qualification stages

They reached the last-16 of the competition after coming behind Bayern Munich from the third pot last year.

Their
 initial seeding meant the potential of topping the group was slim from 
the off, in turn seeing City knocked out by Barcelona after 
finishing second in the first stage.

The Premier League champions will now forgo tricky assignments against one of Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Dortmund, Schalke, Shakhtar Donetsk, FC Basle and Zenit.

Although pot three's quality is strong, it means - in theory at least - that only one side stand in their way of finishing first in a group.

Liverpool, meanwhile, find themselves in pot three after tumbling down to 32nd in UEFA's coefficient rankings through a lack of European football in the 2013-14 season.

It represents a tricky return to the continent's premier competition for the Reds - back after a five-year absence - who will definitely face one of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Porto or Benfica in the group stage.

First time for everything: Manchester City managed to finish second in their group last season

We're in! Liverpool, thanks in part to Luis Suarez, will again compete in the continent's premier competition 

Pot one: Porto

Pot two: Zenit*

Pot three: LIVERPOOL

Pot four: Anderlecht

Pot one: Real Madrid

Pot two: Dortmund

Pot three: LIVERPOOL

Pot four: Roma

Doesn't look too bad: Jose Mourinho's Chelsea will again be in pot one when the draw takes place

Arsenal and Chelsea appear safe as houses in pot one - providing Arsene Wenger's side can maneuver their way through a two-legged play-off in August.

If they can, it'll be the Gunners' 17th consecutive season in the hat - a record only matched by Real Madrid.

No English sides can face each other in a group, although there is the possibility of facing Neil Lennon's Celtic, who would be in pot four alongside the likes of Anderlecht, Roma and Monaco.

Pot one: ARSENAL/CHELSEA

Pot two: FC Basle

Pot three: CSKA Moscow

Pot four: Anderlecht

Pot one: ARSENAL/CHELSEA

Pot two: Dortmund

Pot three: Ajax

Pot four: Roma

Easy street: FA Cup winners Arsenal should qualify for their 17th consecutive season in the Champions League

Should make it: Neil Lennon's Celtic need to qualify but if they do will be in pot four
