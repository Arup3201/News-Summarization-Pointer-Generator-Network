Tesco is launching its own diet service with guidance on how to achieve weight loss goals and a new range of calorie controlled meals.

The scheme will put the supermarket head to head with the likes of Weight Watchers and Slimming World, which dominate the weight loss market and have even been accepted into the NHS.

Shoppers can put their height and weight into Tesco’s Health and Wellbeing website and will then be offered guidance, fitness advice and a personally tailored eating plan.

Slimming: Tesco has launched a range of low-calorie products that combine to create slimming meal plans

Central to the regime is the launch of a range of calorie controlled products under a new brand called ‘my fit lifestyle’.

The products fit under one of five colour coded headings ranging from 100 to 500 calories, which can be combined to create a daily menu.

The range, which is launching initially in London, builds on a new and emerging trend in the US for personalised eating plans and puts together menu suggestions that will add up to less than 2,000 calories a day.

Breakfast might be a ‘Greek style yoghurt with granola, pear, apple, berries’ plus a ‘roasted snack mix’ and a ‘grape, blueberry and pomegranate fruit pot’. Together these add up 398 calories.

Lunch could be a ‘superfood salad with pineapple, kiwi and blueberry seed boost’ paired with a pack of ‘smoked paprika and cream cheese popcorn’, which adds up to 608 calories.

Dinner could be what it calls a ‘Mediterranean graze box’, which includes baked falafels, super food salad, chilli spiced broccoli and edamame beans with yogurt dip, plus as roasted snack mix – at 594 calories.

Range: The line, called 'my fit lifestyle', features granola for breakfast and quinoa (pictured) for dinner

Colour code: Customers can organise their meal plans on the website using colour codes

There is also room for a snack of a ‘quinoa, Edamame & Black Rice Salad Shot’, which comes in at 382 calories. Together this meal plan would come in at 1,982 calories.

The chain will create my fit lifestyle zones both in its stores and on the firm’s Tesco.com website, to help customers put together their personal plans. They will be also able to count their calories on Tesco’s Health and Wellbeing website and app.

To mark the launch of the new range, 
Tesco is offering a Ride ‘n’ Dine restaurant-on-wheels pre-booked taxi 
service in London, which will run for five days and deliver products 
from the new range to home or work.

Trend: The line, which customers can have delivered to their home or work, builds on a trend in the US for personalised meal plans

Tesco is keen to change its images away from a soulless retail juggernaut to a company that is a friend to customers and can offer solutions to real life problems.

Jill Easterbrook, the chain’s chief customer officer, said: ‘We know that our customers are looking for us to help them lead healthier lives.

'They’ve told us that the pressures of the day make sticking to a healthy eating regime can be really difficult.

‘As a working mum of three I know just how busy life can get. That’s why we’re launching my fit lifestyle, so you can mix and match freshly prepared meals to suit your own personal plan.

‘Taken together with our wider programme to help improve health and wellbeing, including our recent decision to withdraw confectionery from all checkouts, and the billions of calories we have removed from our soft drinks, sandwiches and ready meal ranges, my fit lifestyle is another sign of our commitment to help shoppers live more healthily.  

‘By combining fresh, healthy, delicious meals with a personal eating plan, we can support our customers and help them achieve to their health and well-being goals.’

Karen Tonks, in-house nutritionist at Tesco, said: ‘Each of the meals provide two of your five a day, so whether you are aiming for short term weight loss goals or a long term lifestyle change, the my fit lifestyle range, Tesco health and wellbeing website and app are there to guide and support customers.

‘It’s flexible too, so you can follow a complete meal plan or just balance out an indulgent weekend. The range has enough variety to deliver all the nutrients you need for a healthy lifestyle.’

As part of the initiative, Tesco will offer customers free tours with nutritionists in 19 of its larger Extra stores.
