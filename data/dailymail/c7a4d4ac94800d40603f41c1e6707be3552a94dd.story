Getting caught anywhere remotely close to the site of a natural disaster would be a nightmare for most people.

But getting up close and personal with mother nature at her destructive worst is a dream for one avid photographer.

Martin Rietze has spent the last decade travelling the length and breadth of the earth to take these incredible pictures of some of the world's fiercest volcanoes violently erupting.

Fireworks: Sakurajima Volcano captured by Martin Rietze in January this year. He has spent a decade travelling the globe trying to snap the most dramatic pictures of violent volcanic eruptions

Violent: The Sakurajima Volcano in Japan, pictured here, is a notoriously unpredictable volcano. One of his pictures of the volcano was a Nasa picture of the day earlier this year

Stormy: Scientists are uncertain as to why lightning occurs during some eruptions. One theory is that it is caused by charge-inducing collisions in volcanic dust

Daredevil: Martin Rietze pictured taking photographs at Krakatoa volcano, Indonesia

The 49-year-old has risked life and 
limb to get as close as he can to erupting volcanoes in places like 
Chile, Tanzania, Italy, Iceland and Antarctica.

He
 takes time out of his day job as an engineer to travel thousands of 
miles at the drop of a hat and has got so close to the action that he 
has burnt his skin with hot lava in the past and even passed out because
 of their poisonous gases.

Mr
 Rietze said: 'One has to know when it is safe to come near and when it 
is a matter of survival to stay away, sometimes many miles away.'

A
 great deal of planning goes into Mr Rietze's expeditions. He tries to 
catch volcanoes when they are their highest levels of activity, but 
calculating the ups and downs of the eruptions can take days to 
complete.

Feeling hot: Streaks of lava are pictured on Mount Nyiragongo, Congo. It last seriously erupted in 2002 though it is still active

Nature's show: The avid photographer captured this stunning image of lava spewing from the Stromboli Volcano, in Italy

Dangerous: A river of lava flows down the Ol Doinyo Lengai, in Tanzania. To capture distant volcanoes, Martin needs to set aside two weeks

Live wire: Lava spills from the top of mount Stromboli in Italy. The volcano has been in almost continuous eruption for the last 2,000 years

Incredible: This impressive shot of Stromboli looks more like a firework than an act of nature

Hot stuff: A lava pool bubbles over violently at Mount Etna in Sicily. Martin's fascination with volcanoes began when he saw Etna erupt as a child

Bright: An amazing image of the Sakurajima Volcano, in Japan. He tries to catch volcanoes when they are their highest levels of activity, but calculating the ups and downs of the eruptions can take days to complete

He has to put aside a fortnight if he hopes to get some good shots of volcanoes further afield.

The German photographer said each volcano requires a different approach.

He
 gives active stratovolcanos a wider berth as they can throw out lava 
bombs that travel several miles and create pyroclastic flows.

These
 flows are currents of hot gas and rock that reach temperatures of 
1,000C and travel up to 500MPH. Such a deadly surge destroyed Pompeii in
 79AD.

Globe-trotter: Streams of lava are pictured pouring out of the Stromboli volcano. Martin has trekked to volcanoes all around the world including ones in Chile, Tanzania, Italy, Iceland, and Antarctica

Drama: The Eyjafjallajkull volcano, in Iceland, pictured erupting in 2010, when it caused travel chaos with flights grounded by a resultant giant ash cloud

Eruption: This picture of the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano, in Tanzania, looks almost like a work of art rather than a dramatic picture of a volcanic eruption

Fiery: Smoke billows from boiling hot lava at the top of Mount Nyiragongo, Congo

Natural light: A stunning picture of Iceland's  Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano erupting at dusk back in 2010

However, 'red 
volcanoes' create meandering lava flows and pyrotechnic displays that 
can be viewed from relatively nearby. The magma wells up to form new 
land in the sea, such as Kilauea on Hawaii.

His fascination with volcanoes began as a young boy when he witnessed Mount Etna erupt in Sicily.

'I feel like I'm watching Earth's natural fireworks,' he said.

Active: A plume of smoke billows from the Sakurajima volcano in Japan which has been erupting almost constantly since 1955

Beautiful: This photo from December 2009, shows a glowing lava pond inside the summit crater of the Villarica volcano in Southern Chile. The full moon can be seen behind in the early morning dawn

Cautious: The 49-year-old photographer says that each volcano requires a different approach with some of the more violent eruptions needing a wider berth than some others

Patience: Martin Rietze pictured waiting at a safe vantage point for some action at Santiaguito Volcano in Guatemala

Protection: Martin often has to wear a gas mask and protective clothing at the site of a volcano and has been burnt by hot lava and passed out due to the gasses in the past
