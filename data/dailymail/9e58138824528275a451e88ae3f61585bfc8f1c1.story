A woman in Florida has received a $25,000 settlement after a police officer forced her to lift her shirt and shake out her bra during a routine traffic stop.

Zoe Brugger, 29, was pulled over by Lakeland police officer Dustin Fetz on May 21 for a broken headlight.

Silent video taken from the patrol car shows a humiliated Brugger being forced to shake out her bra multiple times in a search for drugs. None were found.

Zoe Brugger, 29, has received a $25,000 settlement from the city of Lakeland, Florida, after a police officer forced her to lift her shirt and shake out her bra during a routine traffic stop

The video went viral and sparked national outrage. Despite search tactics that the State's Attorney called 'highly questionable' and 'demeaning,' a Lakeland police investigation found that Fetz hadn't violated the department's strip-search policy.

He served just a one-day suspension for not having his microphone on.

The $25,000 was approved by city officials July 1 and a check was issued to Brugger on July 7, reports The Ledger Lakeland.

The dashcam video shows Miss Brugger, who had given birth to a
 baby boy just days earlier, crying as she lifts her shirt.

Pulled over: Lakeland Police Officer Dustin Fetz pulled over Zoe Brugger for a broken headlight, and was convinced that she was hiding drugs - which prompted the strange search

Contraband: After being pulled over for a broken headlight in Lakeland, Florida, Zoe Brugger had to shake out her bra twice while the police officer searched for drugs - an action that State Attorney Jerry Hill called 'highly questionable' and 'demeaning'

Officers found no evidence of 
drugs or any other illegal substances when they pulled her and 
boyfriend Larry Fields over for having only one working 
headlight.

Brugger told ABC Action News that Fetz 'made me go through the whole humiliating ordeal with shaking my bra out, right there in the middle of this parking lot on Beacon Road.'

When no drugs appeared, Fetz 'told me that he was taking me to Bartow jail for driving on a suspended license and that they had an x-ray machine there and they were definitely going to find what I had hidden inside of me,' Brugger said. 

Brugger was driving on an invalid license, which was enough reason to arrest her. But Fetz didn't. Instead he asked to search the vehicle, and when the couple relented, he searched it anyway.

Another office who showed up as backup considered the search improper. 

Shake down: Officer Fetz didn't find any drugs on Brugger, or in the car

Fetz broke another rule during the stop by leaving the audio off in the dash camera. If the audio had been turned on, 'there would be little to no speculation as to what occurred during that traffic stop,' said State Attorney Investigator Mike Brown.

At the end of the stop, Fetz told Brugger 'I'm done scaring you, and now you can do home,' she told The News Herald. After the incident, she filed a complaint and notified the State Attorney's Office.

State Attorney Jerry Hill called for an investigation and wrote a critical letter to the Lakeland Police Department saying that the search was 'highly questionable' and not only 'demeaning' but 'ineffective and possibly dangerous.'

He cited the fact that, if Brugger had been concealing a weapon, asking her to shake out her bra would have just given her access to that weapon.

Fetz, on the other hand, told investigators that the search method 'is a known technique that is used by some LPD officers though he can't recall formally being trained to use it.

'Looking back on the incident (Fetz) recognizes that he was overzealous in his attempt to locate illegal drugs or contraband in the car,' Brown said.
