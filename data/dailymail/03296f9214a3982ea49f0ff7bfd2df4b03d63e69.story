Jack Wilshere rarely shirks a tackle. Just ask Paul Scholes or Daniel Agger or Wilshere’s doctor.

He knows only one way, it is in his nature and that is not about to change, even if his stomach lurched and he feared for his World Cup dream when he picked up his phone in March and saw messages backing up from the medical experts.

The injury had not seemed too serious at the time. There was no great pain, he played on for 40 minutes and there was nothing alarming on the post-match scans, but there was a threat of deja vu in the air.

Three years ago, Wilshere hobbled out of Wembley after an England game with a sore ankle and did not play another competitive match for 17 months.

This time, he feared a place in England’s World Cup squad might be in jeopardy when a closer  inspection found a crunching challenge with Agger during an international friendly against  Denmark had caused a hairline fracture in his left foot.

‘The tackle was probably 70-30 in his favour, but I still went into it,’ said Wilshere. ‘That’s me. I can’t change that because it’s a big part of my game. The manager at  Arsenal has always said to me it’s important not to lose that bite.

‘When I first did it, I thought, “Oh no”, but then as I walked off it felt easier and I carried on. After the game, I had a scan straight away and it didn’t show anything. I had to go to someone who specialises in reading scans to see it.

‘Next day, I woke up and had about six missed calls from the doctor, so I went to see the specialist who looked after my right ankle and he said it would take six weeks.

‘It took a few days to get my head round it. I’ve been in that  position before, so I know what it takes — a lot of work in the gym, on the bike, to keep up fitness levels.’

Wilshere returned as a sub at Norwich on Sunday in Arsenal’s final game of the Barclays Premier League season. He is now in contention for Saturday’s FA Cup final against Hull City and made the cut for Roy Hodgson’s 23-man England World Cup squad.

If anyone deserves a break, it is the 22-year-old midfielder earmarked by former England boss Fabio Capello and international skipper Steven Gerrard as a future captain of his country.

‘There’s a few ahead of me,’ said Wilshere. ‘There’s Rooney and Joe Hart. They’re where I want to be. They’ve got experience and won all those caps. People say this is  Gerrard’s last World Cup, am I going to be England’s next captain? No, I’m not.

‘First, I’d like to be captain of my club. The most important thing for me is to get those caps, have a full season without any injuries and just prove myself.’

Without question, injuries have slowed Wilshere. He has won 15 England caps since Capello handed him a debut four years ago but progress has been so painful at times that some have wondered if the young midfielder will ever be the player he promised to be as a teenager.

Scholes touched this issue while working as a TV pundit for the Manchester derby. The former England midfielder  said Wilshere had not improved in five years — a harsh assessment which stunned the Arsenal player.

‘It was out of the blue,’ said Wilshere. ‘He was having a go at Arsenal, and I was wondering if he was going to come for me. If it had come from a rubbish player I could say, “What are you talking about?” but it came from Paul Scholes. For me, he’s the best English midfielder of all time.’

Just as he proved unable to resist the tackle with Agger, he went after Scholes.

‘Go easy on him,’ said England coach Gary Neville as he passed Wilshere a phone number for his former Manchester United team-mate.

‘I wanted to get to the bottom of it,’ said Wilshere. ‘I just wanted to hear what he thinks. I respect him so much. We had quite a good chat. He’s entitled to his opinion. He explained it a bit better and told me what I should work on.

‘He was right in a certain way. I can’t keep saying I’ve been injured a lot. There comes a time when you stop being a kid and I think that’s what he’s referring to. This season I’ve improved a lot, scored a few more; got a few more assists.

‘It’s those stats that  matter. That’s what I have to build on.’

The other angle of that Scholes critique was aimed at the lack of leadership in Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal. Again, it is a moot point for Wilshere as the FA Cup final approaches and Arsenal seek to end nine years without a trophy.

‘I’m young but I’ve been around the first team for a while,’ said Wilshere. ‘I’d like to think of myself as a leader and I like to think the manager thinks of me as a leader.

‘We’ve been here before in the Carling Cup (losing 2-1 to Birmingham City in the 2011 final). No disrespect to the Carling Cup, but this is bigger.

‘You remember the FA Cup finals. It’s right that we go on and win this. We don’t have to prove we have leaders to win this. We just have to win it.’
