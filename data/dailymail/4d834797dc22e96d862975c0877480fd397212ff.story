A Massachusetts woman who made violent threats against Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey in what prosecutors called a 'persistent and malevolent' cyberstalking campaign has been sentenced to more than four years in prison.

A federal judge in Boston also ordered Linda Louise Culkin, of Quincy, to pay Spacey $124,000 in restitution for the actor's bodyguards.

The 55-year-old Culkin has been jailed since January 2012, meaning she has about 18 months left to serve.  

He can rest easy now: Kevin Spacey's female cyberstalker Linda Culkin, 55, was sentenced to more than four years in prison after she pleaded guilty to sending the actor letters filled with violent threats

She pleaded guilty in November to charges including mailing communications threatening to blow up, torture, shoot and disembowel Spacey, and sending false information regarding explosives. 

Spacey was not in court for Wednesday's sentencing. He said in an impact statement it was 'difficult to measure the degree of terror' he felt.

On her part, Culkin apologized and blamed her actions on mental illness.

In May, Kevin Spacey wrote a letter to a federal judge asking to imprison Linda Culkin.

Spacey, 55, revealed that Culkin caused him 'eminent fear,' and asked that she remain in custody and 'undertake intense psychiatric treatment'.

Culkin's lawyer in court documents said there was 'no evidence' her client intended to carry out any threats

Prosecutors said Culkin mailed menacing letters to the Academy Award winner and his business associates, including bomb threats sent to his Los Angeles office in 2009.

The card was traced to Culkin's home, where feds found 'a picture of K.S. with his eyes blacked out and mouth scribbled out, his name written repeatedly in the margin' the Boston Herald reported.

Other evidence concerning Spacey was found under rugs and inside the furniture, including in the 55-year-old woman's cat furniture.

Disturbing tweets included a warning 'that the person would put a bullet in K.S.’s brain and then commit suicide' and one that 'K.S. would be disemboweled', according to an affidavit.

Authorities also seized multiple copies of a page titled 'Killing Kevin Spacey’ with various messages, among them one that read: 'the only way this is gonna be over is when these lads out him 6 foot under.'

The stalker's husband, Edward Culkin, had written to the judge saying that his wife suffered from depression as the result of a violent rape and should not be jailed.

Speaking in court during her sentencing, Mrs Culkin said that she did not mean to be so ‘vindictive.’ However, she declined to shed light on the source of her apparent animosity towards Spacey, the Boston Herald reported. .

‘I was overzealous. I cop to that. I fully apologize to him,’ she said. ‘I didn’t mean it to be so harsh.’
