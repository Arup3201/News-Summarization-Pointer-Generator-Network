Ban: Muslim teachers in the devoutly catholic Philippines have been ordered to take off their veils in the classroom

Women teachers have been 'strongly suggested' to remove their veils when teaching in the classroom in the majority Catholic country of the Philippines.

It is the latest twist in the ongoing controversy over the wearing of the religious garment, that sparked a riot in the French capital Paris on Friday.

An order was sent out by the Filipino Government yesterday instructing females who teach Arabic language and Islamic values to take off the religious niqab, which covers all of the face except the eyes.

The Government believes this will lead to better relationships between teachers and pupils.

Education secretary Armin Luistro said it was part of reforms designed to make schools more sensitive to religion.

The ruling does not apply to the hijab - garments that cover the head only.

Muslim schoolgirls will still be allowed to wear the veil in schools as well as 'appropriate clothing' in gym class.

But while female Muslim schoolteachers can wear the veil outside class, they have been told to remove the veil during lessons so they can interact better with students.

The order stated: 'Once the teacher is in the classroom, she is requested to remove the veil.'

It added the move would help aid 'proper identification of the teachers by their pupils, thus promoting better teacher-pupil relationship'.

It would also help the teaching of languages, where 'lip formation' plays a role in pronouncing certain letters.

The Government’s Office of Muslim Affairs said it agreed with the education department’s measures, although it had not yet received a copy of the order.

Roque Morales, an adviser to the office, claimed that while he did not know how many Muslim Filipinas were working as teachers, the practice of wearing veils, such as hijabs and niqabs, was widespread in the southern Philippines.

He said: 'You would almost see it everywhere.'

So far there have not been any complaints from Muslim teachers, he added.

The office said that Muslims make up about 15 per cent of the Philippine population, mostly based in the southern regions, which they consider their ancestral home.

The hijab and niqab - a religious garment worn by some Muslim women to cover their whole face - continue to divide cultures around the world.

Two years ago, France banned the niqab and the burqa from being worn anywhere in public in a move that sparked protests among Muslims.

On Friday rioting broke out in the Paris suburb of Trappes after police carried out identity checks on a Muslim woman who was wearing a full face veil, according to the Guardian.

Her husband was arrested and taken into custody amid allegations he had assaulted one of the officers involved.

Hundreds of people took to the streets, hurling stones and paving slabs and setting fire to cars, bins and bus shelters, demanding his release.

Riot police tackled them with tear gas. The police station was said to have been under siege for about an hour.

A second night of rioting followed on Saturday, when violence threatened to spread to nearby towns.

The Collective Against Islamophobia in France released a statement 
complaining of heavy handed policing.

In 2004 France introduced a law banning state employees from wearing prominent religious symbols, such as Christian crosses and Jewish skullcaps, as well as Muslim veils.

Current France President Francois Hollande now wants a new law that could extend this into the private sector.
