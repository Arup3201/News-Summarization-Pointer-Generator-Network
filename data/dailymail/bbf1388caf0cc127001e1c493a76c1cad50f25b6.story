Thirteen people have been killed in violent clashes between riot police and Islamist protestors in Egypt today after the Muslim Brotherhood renewed calls to support the country's former president.

Heavily populated residential areas across the country were struck by violence as rocks, tear gas and Molotov cocktails were hurled back and forth between police forces and demonstrators.

Cairo, Giza, Ismailia and Alexandria were among the worst affected, where security forces launched water cannons on the protesting crowds.

Tension between government forces and the Muslim Brotherhood has been rife since the removal of the Islamist president in July

In the Cairo district of Nasr City, riot police in bulletproof vests fired teargas at protesters throwing fireworks and stones.

The Health Ministry said five people were killed in different districts in Cairo, with a source confirming they died from bullet wounds.

One of the five was a man who was shot dead by the protesters after he yelled insults at Brotherhood demonstrators marching near his house.

A male protester and a woman were shot dead in the coastal city of Alexandria, medical and security sources said though it was not clear whether the woman was a protester or not.

Two were shot dead by police in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia after a march set off from a mosque after midday prayers while three more, including a student, were shot in the head and chest in Fayoum, Reuters reports.

A Brotherhood-led alliance claimed the 
death toll had reached 19 on a social media website, though this figure 
has not been confirmed.

More than 58 people are thought to have been injured in the conflict.

Those in support of the country's ousted former president, Mohammed Morsi, set fire to cars and threw fireworks at officials who were clad in protective clothing.

More than 100 Brotherhood protestors were arrested carrying homemade grenades and Molotov cocktails according to a statement released by the Interior Ministry.

Today's violence is the latest outburst since the Islamist leader was ousted by a military coup on July 3.

Thirteen people have been confirmed dead and at least 52 people injured according to figures revealed by the Health Ministry

The Muslim Brotherhood is the country's most organised political group, but has seen supporter numbers dwindle since in recent months after the military-backed interim government launched a severe crackdown on protest.

Hundreds of Brotherhood members have been killed and thousands arrested since the crackdown this summer.

The government last week ordered the seizure of hundreds assets belonging to non-governmental groups who they suspected were linked to the Muslin organisation.

The Brotherhood has changed tactics in response, relying on more female and student supporters to lead protests ahead of key events.

The second stage of the former president's trial over the killing of protesters will take place on January 8.

A referendum over a new, more secular referendum is due to take place on January 14 and 15. 

The draft charter is an amended version 
of the 2012 constitution drawn up by an Islamist-dominated panel under 
Morsi, which was suspended during the coup.

The Brotherhood has been labelled as a terrorist organisation in recent weeks, and has been accused of having ties to a well known al-Qaeda inspired group called the Champions of Jerusalem.

The group has claimed responsibility for many attacks including a deadly December 24 bombing of a security headquarters in a Nile Delta city.

A referendum over a new, more secular leaning constitution is due to be held in Egypt later this month

Minister for Religious Endowments Mohammed Mokhtar Gomaa today warned against supporting calls by protesters to stop paying utility bills to oppose the government, in reference to a Brotherhood-led campaign. 

'Those aiming to topple the state are enemies to God and the Prophet' he said at the Al-Hussein mosque in downtown Cairo. 

Three explosions today struck a military and police convoy in the northern Sinai Peninsula, wounding four soldiers. 

The explosions, one of which was from a roadside bomb, hit near the town of Sheikh Zuweid, close to the border with the Gaza Strip, said an anonymous security official.
