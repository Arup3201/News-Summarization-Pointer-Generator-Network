Wembley play-off hero Bobby Zamora has agreed a new one-year deal to stay at QPR.

The 33-year-old striker will sign a new one-year contract at Loftus Road and play a part in their forthcoming Premier League season under Harry Redknapp.

It was Zamora's winning goal against Derby in May which secured Rangers' promotion which could be worth around £134million for the club.

£134million goal: Zamora scored the winner at Wembley against Derby to send QPR up

Zamora's signature will be a relief to Redknapp who lost 11 players in the summer either out of contract or loaners returning to their parent clubs.

He has also become frustrated that the club have failed to sign off a deal for former England defender Rio Ferdinand with owner Tony Fernandes wanting younger signings.

QPR still have an interest in signing Spurs midfielder Lewis Holtby who was on loan at Fulham last season.
