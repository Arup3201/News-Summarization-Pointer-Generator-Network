A British skier has fallen hundreds of metres to his death in the French Alps.

The man in his mid-30s was descending the north face of the Tour Ronde in the French Alps when it's thought he lost one of his ski's and slid down a 'couloir' - a narrow gully with a steep gradient.

He was skiing down Mont Blanc - near Chamonix - with four of his friends, who immediately alerted the rescue services after the accident. Unfortunately, he had died instantly.

A police spokesman said: 'He was with friends. He fell in a couloir and fell and slid a total of about 400 metres, not vertical.

'An investigation into the accident is underway.'

He added: 'The conditions are dangerous. People must pay attention to the weather bulletins and the conditions.'

The man's body was retrieved by helicopter. The four other skiers made their own way back to Chamonix.

La Tour Ronde, located on the French-Italian border between the Col Du Geant and Mont Maudit, rises to a height of 3,792 metres.

The north face is considered a difficult and dangerous descent reserved for highly experienced mountaineers.

It has been a deadly season in the Alps. Also on Friday a 46-year-old French woman was killed in an avalanche in Valloire in the Savoie region.

While in Austria, a doctor from Northern Ireland was killed in a skiing accident last week. And Dr Siobhan O'Connor, an experienced skier in her 50's, crashed while skiing down a steep section of the mountain.

On January 5, two young US ski team hopefuls were killed in the Austrian Alps. Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, were caught in an avalanche.

At least 10 more people have been killed this season in the Alps in avalanches and other accidents.
