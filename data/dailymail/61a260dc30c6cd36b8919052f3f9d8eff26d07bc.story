A Chinese motorist paid a hefty price for lane-cutting after the driver he overtook slammed the accelerator - and ended up on the other car's bonnet. 

The accident, caught on the dashboard camera of a third vehicle, in Chengdu City, capital of south-west China's Sichuan Province, left both cars needing to be towed to a garage.   

The video, which was posted online, shows the moment Fai Chu, 28, driving a silver Audi, cut in front of businessman Kang Niu - forcing him to brake suddenly.

Dash-cam footage captured the moment a Chinese driver was forced to brake after a silver Audi cut in front

But the driver of the black Nissan Teana Kang Niu  took offence at the lane-cutting and put his foot down

After briefly braking, Mr Kang, 39, who was driving a black Nissan Teana, took offence at Mr Fai's actions - and decided it was his right of way and put his foot down, causing a pile-up.

But, instead of bashing the silver Audi into its own lane, the incident left the black Nissan on top of the Audi's bonnet, leaving both cars were stranded.

Another motorist Cong Chuang, said the men then got out of their cars and blocked traffic as they argued.

The 27-year-old said: 'They could have tried to sort it out themselves but instead they got out of their cars and started shouting at each other, and arguing for several minutes blocking the traffic for everybody.'

Police arrived a short while later and  arrested both drivers.
