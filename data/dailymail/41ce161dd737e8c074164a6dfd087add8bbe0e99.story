The Marquess of Northampton married Tracy Goodman last year (pictured) after five failed marriages 

When the Marquess of Northampton, one of Britain’s wealthiest aristocrats, divorced his fifth wife, his friends worried that he would never be truly happy again.

And they were understandably concerned to learn that, despite the deep acrimony of the split and a vast £17 million settlement, the 68-year-old Marquess was now contemplating going down the aisle for an astonishing sixth time – to marry a glamorous blonde psychotherapist and yoga teacher who is 18 years his junior.

Now, one year on from their wedding at Chelsea Register Office, Tracy Goodman has decided to speak about her dramatic change of fortune, which has taken her from life as a state-school educated career woman with a flat just off London’s Chiswick High Road to a new world as a Marchioness and chatelaine of not one but two stately homes, including the magnificent 84-room Compton Wynyates, a Tudor mansion in Warwickshire.

And, while she won’t discuss the details of any professional help she may have given her new husband, who is known as Spenny, it is clear, say his friends, that he is happier than he has been for years.

‘When I look through my bedroom window and I’m in a castle and see the gorgeous view, moat and 17th Century windmill, I have to pinch myself. It feels like a dream,’ says Tracy. 

‘But meeting and marrying Spenny was completely natural. Finding love like that was all about timing – it came right for both of us.

‘I still see all my old friends and they assure me I haven’t let my marriage into the aristocracy go to my head. I haven’t changed and I don’t intend to.’

The collapse of the Marquess’s fifth marriage to Pamela, his wife of 23 years, had been all the more distressing because it emerged that she had been conducting an affair with one of his closest friends, pharmaceutical tycoon Dr Dan Stoicescu.

Like his new wife, Pamela Haworth had come from humble origins, the daughter of a toolmaker from Accrington, Lancashire. The Marquess had often described her as the love of his life but last year he divorced her on grounds of adultery.

Yet romance returned to his life just months later, when the daughter from his fourth marriage, Lady Louisa, introduced him to Tracy on a visit to California.

The Marchioness, who speaks with a soft Devon burr, is originally from Plymouth, where a youthful passion for surfing and international travel led her into a career as an air stewardess with British Airways.

While at BA, she took degrees in psychotherapy and trained as a yoga teacher, rising to become manager and clinical supervisor of the airline’s in-house counselling service Crewcare. She later went on to work at the celebrity rehab clinic The Priory, where she specialised in eating disorders and sex addiction.

She also studied at the famous Meadows clinic in Arizona – whose clients have included celebrities such as Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, Kate Moss and Ronnie Wood – and now works at The Recovery Centre in Belgravia.

‘I specialise in relationship difficulties, depression and anxiety. I like to be able to help others – but most people seem to like referring to me being a sex therapist!’ she smiles.

‘It does feel weird to have such a grand title but I don’t go around wearing a tiara,’ she laughs, speaking at a cocktail party she hosted in aid of International Animal Rescue charity at a London private members’ club.

‘Being a Marchioness is still very new – we recently celebrated our first wedding anniversary. It’s something to adjust to. Spenny has such presence, especially with the locals in the countryside in Warwickshire. I’m adapting to the role.’

Spenny, whose real name is Spencer Compton, is sometimes known as the ‘Mystic Marquess’ because of his fascination with Freemasonry and ancient mysticism.

Wives numbers one and two: The Marquess was married to Henriette Bentinck, the daughter of the late Dutch ambassador Baron Adolph Bentinck from 1967-1973 (left). The year after his first divorce, he wed Annette Smallwood (right)

In 1977, Rosie Dawson-Damer became his third wife but the pair divorced in 1983. She is reported to have received a settlement and a trust fund for their daughter in the proceedings 

The new couple now divide their time between Grade I listed Compton Wynyates and their other stately pile, Castle Ashby in Northamptonshire, which is currently home to his 41-year-old son and heir Daniel, Earl Compton, and his villa on the island of Tenerife. They also spend a good deal of time in America.

Tracy will shortly celebrate her 50th birthday on a trip to Arizona with her husband, who has a fortune estimated at £120 million.

‘When we were first married, all that people seemed to concentrate on was his marriage scandal and saying I was a sex therapist, but there’s a lot more to my practice than that,’ she says.

‘Although I’ve scaled down my psychotherapy work because I need to travel with Spenny, I’m determined to continue in practice because I value my independence,’ she explains.

She does admit, however, that she doesn’t use her grand title in her professional life. ‘I don’t particularly want everybody to know who I married because I was concerned it might affect my relationship with them,’ she explains.

She has also become stepmother to the Marquess’s four children (by wives one, three and four) and five grandchildren and latest in a succession of Marchionesses.

Lord Northampton’s first marriage in 1967 was to Henriette Bentinck, daughter of the late Dutch ambassador Baron Adolph Bentinck. 

The couple had two children but divorced in 1973. It is said that Henriette received a six-figure settlement, but that she was so financially unaware, she lodged it in her current account. 

Fritzi (Ellen) Erhardt, the ex-wife of Viscount Cowdray (left) became the Marques's fourth wife in 1985. The pair were married for three years before he met Pamela Haworth (right) who he was to be married to the longest 

She died in 2010. In 1974, Spenny married Annette Smallwood, the secretary of KIDS, a charity for deprived children, which he had set up. They divorced three years later in 1977.

The woman who was to become his third wife – Rosie Dawson-Damer – was named in the divorce petition, and he married her the same year. In 1983, however, Lord Northampton was back in the divorce courts. ‘He gave me a settlement and a trust fund for our daughter,’ Rosie revealed at the time.

Then came Fritzi (Ellen) Erhardt, the ex-wife of Viscount Cowdray, whom he married in 1985. The couple had split once even before they wed and finally divorced in 1988.

Lawyers said she could have claimed millions but it was reported at the time that she had accepted a settlement of about £300,000. It was, however, the Marquess’s acrimonious fifth marriage – and divorce – that attracted the greatest scandal.

‘She is the centre of my life. I call her “stregissima” – great white witch,’ he said delightedly when he married Pamela Haworth in December 1990 at a Stratford-Upon-Avon register office.

He was Pamela’s third husband.

The couple's lengthy marriage ended after the Marquess discovered her affair with a family friend 

The marriage was by some distance his most successful. But in 2006, they met Romanian-born Dr Stoicescu at a Freemasonry convention in Cyprus. Dr Stoicescu calls himself a ‘transhumanist’ and has a deep-seated interest in immortality and anti-ageing therapies. He has his own fortune estimated at £180 million.

The divorced scientist and entrepreneur became a firm family friend, paying for both the Marquess and Pamela to undergo a £220,000 human genome mapping process – which can reveal genetic diseases – at a US clinic.

Stoicescu also lavished gifts on Pamela, including a Cartier necklace with matching earrings. And by 2009 she had begun working for him, telling her husband that she had been made president of one of his biopharmaceutical companies, a role that meant she made frequent trips to America.

Though the Marquess had become suspicious of how close Stoicescu was becoming to his wife, it was not until he was handed tapes of conversations between Pamela and her 87-year-old father, which confirmed the affair – and became the subject of a potentially costly legal wrangle – that he had evidence which led him to file divorce proceedings in 2010.

The tapes had been made by Suzanne Shipwright, a 62-year-old former beautician who has lived with Pamela’s father Jim for the past few decades, since his divorce from her mother Martina. Suzanne is said to have had a troubled relationship with Pamela.

It prompted the Marquess to throw her out of Compton Wynyates and sparked a bitter court battle which lasted more than two years.

Pamela’s divorce settlement is believed to have cost him in the region of £17 million. This includes a £4 million apartment in Pimlico as well as cash and possessions worth about £13 million.

Despite his five divorces, Lord Northampton still has a sizeable £120 million fortune – including the stately homes and a hoard of Roman treasure worth £100 million, but so contentious it cannot be sold.

Pamela has had further difficulties since then.

Last June she was served with an eviction notice by Dr Stoicescu demanding she leave his spectacular £8 million mansion in San Diego, California, where she had been living since her divorce.

He, meanwhile, had engaged on an affair of his own – later marrying his new mistress, 50-year-old Maria Torres from the Dominican Republic.

Tracy, however, is undeterred by all the fuss. ‘It took me a long time to find the right man – I had a few long- term boyfriends before, but no children,’ she explains.

She may be a Marchioness, but she remains as practical and down-to-earth as ever. ‘I’m still the same old me – Tracy, without an E,’ she says.

 

Lady Northampton was interviewed at the Rescue Me fundraiser for International Animal Rescue which is particularly campaigning to save orang-utans in Borneo and to stop illegal birdhunting in Malta.
