Two sisters helped themselves to jewellery worth £500 - seconds after a bungled armed robbery at a pawnbrokers.

Masked raiders fled empty-handed after they smashed holes in the glass counter with a sledgehammer.

Sisters Eva Bandova, 55, and Sona Horvathova, 45, who were shopping in the store, waited for them to leave - then reached through the holes and snatched rings.

But their 'stupid' theft was captured on CCTV.

It shows the pair cowering in fear - and then just seconds later selecting the rings and calmly walking out.

The robbers - wearing crash helmets, masks and gloves - have never been caught. But scheming Bandova and Horvathova were arrested within days, because staff at the shop had their personal details.

The Czech-born sisters, who live together on Crescent Road, Cheetham Hill, both admitted theft.

The sisters helped themselves to £500 worth of jewellery from the store

They had just completed a silver transaction at H&T pawnbrokers on Cheetham Hill Road in Manchester when the robbers burst inside in January.

Bandova, described as a regular customer, is seen on the floor in terror.

Horvathova ran out as the robbers smashed the counter.

John Werhun, prosecuting at Manchester magistrates court, said staff activated a panic alarm and fled to a back room as the sledgehammer was being used to smash the display cases.

He said: 'For whatever reason the robbers decide that enough is enough and leave the store. Despite their efforts, they do not manage to leave with anything.

'It is unambiguous. Both ladies reach a hand into the holes in the counter. Quite why they decided to jump onto the bandwagon I do not know.

'Within a short time , they have seen an
opportunity and hatched this plan between them. It is a fluke. They 
obviously do not realise that the CCTV was running. It was a very easy 
matter for the staff to give their details to the police and they were 
arrested.'

The stolen rings have never been recovered.

Suzanne Ludlow, representing Bandova, said the incident displayed a 'lack of judgement and a lapse of control'. She said: 'They were unaware of the CCTV in the shop. Miss Bandova, on sight of her sister placing her hand in one of the cabinets, duly does the same. It was clearly a spur of the moment decision and something which Miss Bandova deeply regrets.'

Robert Stewart, for Horvathova, said the case was "the most opportunistic theft" he has dealt with.

He added: 'It can only be described as a moment of stupidity. They were victims who became offenders.'

Bandova was sentenced to a nine-week curfew order, meaning she must stay at home between 7pm and 7am each day.

The order will be monitored by an electronic ankle tag. She was also ordered to pay £100 costs and £250 compensation.

Horvathova will be sentenced on May 29 after pre-sentence reports are drawn up.
