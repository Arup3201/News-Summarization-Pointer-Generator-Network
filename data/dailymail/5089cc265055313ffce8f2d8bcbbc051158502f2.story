A British mother is desperate to get her daughter back after she was snatched in Egypt by her father for a second time.

Leila Sabra fought an eight-month battle for custody of five-year-old daughter A'ishah after she was taken in 2009.

The 35-year-old, from Whitefield, Greater Manchester, moved to Cairo and was reunited with the youngster after her father Saber Mesbah Sabra was arrested.

But Mrs Sabra says he failed to return A'ishah after an access visit three months ago.

She has now returned to the UK in a bid to get help from the Government after living in Cairo since 2009.

A'ishah is thought to be at her father's home in the mountain village of Khafr-el-Sheikh.

Mrs Sabra told the Manchester Evening News that the 'chaos' in Egypt following revolution had prevented her getting support from the country's police and courts.

She said: 'I cannot believe this has happened again, I am terrified something will happen to A'ishah as Egypt is not a safe place at the moment.'

Mrs Sabra added that she'd spoken to her daughter on the phone and she was 'unhappy and crying'.

She had met her former husband when she went to the country on holiday in 2005.

They married months later and the family lived in Egypt, where Mr Sabra ran a quad biking company.

The two moved to Whitefield when Mrs Sabra began to suffer from medical problems while pregnant. A'ishah was born at St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester and the family moved back to Egypt soon after.

But the relationship broke down and Mrs Sabra returned to England, agreeing that their daughter would visit once a year.

A'ishah was first snatched by her father in May 2009 during a supervised visit to the east coast city of Hurghada.

The two-year-old was snatched from a cafe, bundled into the back of a car and driven away.

Leila searched Egypt for her daughter and the two were reunited after Leila was awarded custody by the Egyptian courts in January 2010.

A'ishah's father was arrested by Egyptian police but was later released.

A Foreign Office spokesperson said they were aware of the case and were providing consular assistance.
