An electrician who was so overweight his company had to buy him a specially reinforced van has been crowned the 'Greatest Loser 2013' after shedding more than half his bodyweight.

Dean Worrall, 36, lost 16st 13.5 lbs after he was made redundant and had feared he wouldn't get another job due to his 33st bulk.

After making dramatic changes to his diet, he now weighs 16st 4lbs and has whittled down hisÂ  waistline from 68 inches to just 40 inches in less than two years - and has finally got his career back on track.

Half the man he was: Dean Worrall has lost 16st 13.5 lbs in less than two years

But in 2009, after years of living on fried food and calorie-laden tubs of ice cream, Dean was so overweight he was unable to perform basic tasks at work including climbing ladders and squeezing into small spaces.

Dean, who was crowned Slimming World's Greatest Loser after losing more weight than any other member this year, said: 'My weight impacted on every aspect of my work to the point where, if I'm honest, I struggled to do my job properly.

'When I needed a new van there were only a few models I could have because I couldn't fit into the front seats of most of them.

'When I went on a job I had to bring a mate or an apprentice because I couldn't fit in certain spaces, and I couldn't go up into lofts in case I came through the ceiling.

But worse was to come.

'When I was made redundant I wondered who would ever want to hire a 33 stone electrician,' he revealed.

Career back on track: Dean was worried he wouldn't get another job because of his large size

'Every time I walked into a room for an interview I had to ask for a bigger chair or one without arms because they didn't fit me. That was almost like a cross in the box against me before I'd even started.'

Dean, who is single, said he hit rock bottom in August 2010 after 18 months out of work. It was during an interview during which he had to ask for a wider chair that he finally realised he had to lose weight.

'I knew losing weight would be the best way to increase my chances of finding work again,' he explained.

Dean's weight problems began as a child but trouble really started after he left aged 16 and began to enjoy the freedom earning money and being able to drive brought him.

He explained: 'The combination of available funds, the freedom that having a car gave me and long hours working and at college meant that I was living on fast food on the move and before I knew it my weight was out of control.

'My biggest vice was takeaway pizza with extra bacon and cheese - I knew I could order it at work and it would be there by the time I got home.'

Accolade: Dean has been crowned Slimming World's Greatest Loser 2013

Before losing weight, he'd tuck into a full English breakfast or sausage and egg McMuffins, followed by a lunch of pie and chips, while dinner consisted of chicken nuggets or pizza with extra bacon and cheese and chips with a tub of Haagen Dazs ice cream for dessert.

If he felt peckish between meals, Dean opted for a bar of chocolate or bag of crisps to satisfy his hunger.

However, after switching to porridge or yoghurt for breakfast, tuna with couscous and grilled veg for lunch and healthy roasted chicken and veg for dessert Dean noticed the weight melt away.

A visit to his GP brought a referral to a slimming group, and Dean, who chose a Slimming World group with a male leader, was surprised and pleased to see several other men in the group, and soon began losing weight.

He found work through an agency just a week after joining and has been busy ever since, while the weight-loss has transformed his working day.

He said: 'I'm loving life again and would recommend anyone who's thinking about trying to lose weight, whether it's just a stone or two or a lot like me , just to go for it.

'I'd never have believed I'd be here less than three years later and half the man I was with a whole new life to look forward to, but it's true.'
