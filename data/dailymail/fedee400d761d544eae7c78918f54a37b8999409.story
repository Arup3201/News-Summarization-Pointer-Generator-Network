The boyfriend of a Bollywood actress 
who was found dead at her home in Mumbai has been arrested on suspicion 
of abetting her suicide.

Jiah Khan, 25, was last week found hanged by her mother at their apartment in the Indian city. Police said no suicide note was found.

Suraj Pancholi, 21, the son of famous Bollywood actors Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab, was arrested late yesterday. He had been Khan's boyfriend for about a year and was the last person to see her alive.

The arrest comes two days after Jiah's mother and sister found a six-page letter, supposedly written by Jiah before her death, blaming her boyfriend for ruining her life, cheating on her and forcing her to abort their child.

Officer D Deokar said Suraj Pancholi, confirmed that Khan committed suicide at her home in Mumbai last week.

Khan began her career in the 2007 
Hindi film Nishabd, in which she portrayed a teenager in love with her 
best friend's father, played by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan.

She also performed with other top stars, including Aamir Khan and Akshay Kumar.

The mother and sister of the actress are said to have gone out and she was alone at the apartment when the incident happened.

They found her hanged when they returned home.

Miss Khan reportedly wanted to pursue a career in interior design when her acting career failed to meet its early potential.

Fellow Bollywood stars and fans of the actress took to Twitter to express their shock at her death.

Ram Gopal Varma, who directed her debut film Nishabd, said that she had been 'very depressed' about her career.[

The
25-year-old actress made her Bollywood debut in 2007, playing the 
18-year-old female lead opposite one of India's leading actors, Amitabh 
Bachchan, in a film loosely based on Vladimir Nabokov's classic novel 
Lolita.

Filmmaker Varma 
wrote on Twitter: 'Never ever seen a debutant actress with more spunk 
and more spirit than Jiah when I was directing her in Nishabd.

'I don't know the reason what led to 
this but Jiah was very depressed about her career and scared for her 
future,' he said in another tweet.

He added: 'The last time I met her Jiah told me that everyone around her makes her feel like a failure.'

Khan, whose real name was Nafisa Khan, was born in New York and grew up in Chelsea, London.

She returned to New York at the age of 17 to study acting, according to her website.

Nishabd received mixed reviews and did
not do well at the Bollywood box office but Khan went on to play 
supporting roles in two blockbusters, the psychological thriller Ghajini
in 2008 and the comedy Housefull, her last role, in 2010.

Amitabh Bachchan tweeted his shock at the death of the actress.

He said: 'WHAT ...!!! Jiah Khan? What has happened? Is this correct? Unbelievable!!!'

choreographer
Farah Khan tweeted: 'Can't register that Jiah is no more... Worked with
her in Housefull and she was so beautiful and such a good soul. Too 
young to go Jiah.'

Bollywood
actor Shahid Kapoor tweeted: 'Shocked n saddened to hear about jiah 
khan ... Very disturbing ... RIP ....may her soul rest in peace.'

According to Miss Khan's website, she was to play a part in a forthcoming Hollywood production.

As well as her Bollywood acting, she had appeared in an advert for animal campaign group PETA.

She was the daughter of Ali Rivzi Khan, an Indian-American actress who found fame in the 1980s.

A six-page letter found in Jiah Khan's bedroom has come as a shocking revelation for her family and fans. The 25-year-old actress, who came across as a bubbly woman, was actually traumatised and lovelorn. Excerpts from the letter are below:

'I don't know how to say this to you but I might as well now as I have nothing to lose. I've already lost everything. If you're reading this I might have already left or about to leave. I am broken inside. You may not have known this but you affected me deeply to a point where I lost myself in loving you. Yet you tortured me every day.

These days I see no light I wake up not wanting to wake up. There was a time I saw my life with you, a future with you. But you shattered my dreams. I feel dead inside. I've never given so much of myself to someone or cared so much. You returned my love with cheating and lies.

It didn't matter how many gifts I gave you or how beautiful I looked for you. I was scared of getting pregnant but I gave myself completely.

When I first met you I was driven, ambitious and disciplined. Then I fell for you, a love I thought would bring out the best in me. I don't know why destiny brought us together.

After all the pain, the rape, the abuse, the torture I have seen previously I didn't deserve this. I didn't see any love or commitment from you. I just became increasingly scared that you would hurt me mentally or physically.

Your life was about partying and women. Mine was you and my work. If I stay here I will crave you and miss you.

So, I am kissing my 10-year career and dreams goodbye. I never went with anyone else. I am a loyal person. No other woman will give you as much as I did or love you as much as I did. I can write that in my blood...

You never even met my sister. I bought your sister presents... You never appreciated my love, kicked me in the face... The Goa trip was my birthday present but even after you cheated I still spent on you.

I aborted our baby when it hurt me deeply... I wish you had loved me like I loved you... I leave this place with nothing but broken dreams and empty promises. All I want now is to go to sleep and never wake up again...'
