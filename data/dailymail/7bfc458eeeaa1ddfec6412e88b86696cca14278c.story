Last week Sony transformed London’s OXO Tower to look like a PlayStation controller and not to be outdone, today Microsoft has gone one better.

The Washington-based firm has taken over the whole of London’s Leicester Square and renamed the landmark Xbox One Square.

A giant Xbox stage has been built for the first ever live concert in the square, signs have been replaced and people have dressed up as game characters to celebrate the midnight launch of Microsoft's new Xbox One console.

Crowds: Thousands of gamers are expected to queue in tonight¿s rain to buy the follow-up to 2005¿s Microsoft Xbox 360

Publicity stunt: Even the street signs in Leicester Square were replaced for the launch

The console costs £429.99 and comes with a redesigned, advanced Kinect motion sensor.

The Xbox One plays games, videos and is called an ‘entertainment device’ rather than a gaming console.

Its built-in apps include Skype, Netflix, Wuaki, TED and more.

The Kinect 2's new cameras and sensors are so sensitive that they can 
pick up a user’s heart rate from minute changes in the colour of their 
skin.

Users can also build up a 3D scan of their face, which is then used to create a personal avatar or games warrior.

Other
 improvements to the Kinect sensor include being able to tell which 
muscles are in use while the player uses an app, and
 determine how much force is being applied.

Thousands of gamers have queued in the rain to buy the follow-up to 2005’s Microsoft Xbox 360.

And now the patient gamers were rewarded for their waiting.

Charlie Pulbrook is the first person in the UK to buy the new Xbox One, while 34-year-old Gareth Owen from Cessnock in Glasgow was the first person in his city receive the new console.

Around the world people have queued up to get their hands on the latest Xbox, with actors wearing costumes from games to promote the sale.

But the privilege of having the latest update on the games market comes at a price.

The console costs £429.99 and comes with a redesigned, advanced Kinect motion sensor. 

A number of fans, VIPs and journalists were given tickets to the launch event in Leicester Square and a number surprise celebrity guests are expected. 

There will be similar events taking place in New York and Los Angeles featuring music from Deadmau5 and rapper Macklemore.

The console goes on sale at 500 shops across the country, including 300 Game stores which will open at midnight especially for the launch.

Queues began forming at 7.30am outside Game’s Xbox store in Shoreditch, east London, and other similar queues were spotted at the Westfield Stratford store.

Tesco will 
sell the consoles on a first-come first-served basis at more than 100
 of its Extra stores from midnight.

However, not everyone will be able to get their hands on the must-have gadget.

Amazon announced earlier this month 
that pre-orders up to 13 November would not arrive before Christmas and 
retailers are warning there will be a shortage.

The
 Xbox One is going head-to-head with Sony’s new PlayStation 4, which 
goes on sale in the UK next week at £349.99 - £80 cheaper than its 
rival.

The Xbox One plays games, videos and is called an ‘entertainment device’ rather than a gaming console.

While the new Kinect has had a number of upgrades. Its new cameras and sensors are so sensitive that they can pick up a user’s heart rate from minute changes in the colour of their skin.

Users can also build up a 3D scan of their face, which is then used to create a personal avatar or games warrior.

The console is the first new Xbox to launch in eight years, while Sony has not updated its PlayStation since 2007.

Phil Harrison, a corporate vice president at Microsoft, said: ‘We’re proud and excited that Xbox One is going to be the biggest launch in Xbox history.

‘Xbox One is a complete, all-in-one 
system which has the best games, the best online service in Xbox Live, 
the best entertainment experiences and is built for the future.

'Pre-orders from fans across the UK are at unprecedented levels.’

Tesco's Home Entertainment Manager, Stephen Owusu, said: ‘The launch of the 
Xbox One is a massive event for millions of gamers around the world and 
the console is sure to top many Christmas present lists this year.

‘The
 last Xbox console – the Xbox 360 – was launched eight years ago so 
there has been a lot of expectation and talk from gamers about this 
latest version.

'If the U.S. launch is anything to go by these will fly 
off the shelves.’

Microsoft's next-generation Kinect sensor is able to detect and monitor a person's heart rate from around four feet away - without touching them. As blood passes through a person's body, the skin changes colour ever so slightly. The camera can recognise these changes to establish how fast the blood is pumping
