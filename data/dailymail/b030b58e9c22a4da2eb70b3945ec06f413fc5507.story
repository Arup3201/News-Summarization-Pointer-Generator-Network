Newcastle's Premier League clash with Leicester was delayed by an hour because of a safety issue with the new giant screen at St James' Park.

The Magpies only installed the monitor above the Leazes End this week and it was making its debut against the Foxes.

But dressing panels surrounding the screen came loose amid high winds on Tyneside and referee Martin Atkinson advised that fans were not allowed into the ground.

The new scoreboard at St James' Park, hanging above a section of the stand,reportedly came loose, causing concerns regarding safety

As the wind picked up around the ground, staff were forced to investigate whether the screen was safe

An initial club statement read: ‘Newcastle United can confirm that there is currently a short delay in opening the turnstiles for today's game whilst an issue with the new screen is being addressed.’

This was followed by second statement, which read: 'An engineer is on site and will make a full appraisal at approximately 3pm. 

'Further information will be available as soon as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience caused. 

The fears  led to the game being delayed by an hour and no fans of either team were let into the stadium until after three o'clock

'We will bring you updates including any information on turnstiles and a revised kick-off time as soon as we can. Thank you for your patience.'

The club eventually announced that the game would kick-off at four o'clock.

The club then apologised for the inconvenience caused to supporters, saying: 'We wish to apologise once again to everyone who suffered inconvenience as a result of this issue today and wish to place on record our particular thanks to all supporters at St James’ Park for their patience.' 

It has been quite a week for Atkinson, who abandoned the European Championships qualifier between Serbia and Albania in Belgrade after a drone carrying an Albanian flag – including the disputed region of Kosovo – landed in the stadium, triggering fighting between players and fans.

Newcastle United Football Club would like to offer sincere apologies to everyone affected by the delay to kick-off of today’s Barclays Premier League fixture with Leicester City at St. James’ Park.

Turnstiles were closed until 3:15pm whilst loose dressing panels surrounding the newly-installed LED screen in the Leazes Stand were assessed and made secure by engineers. Kick-off was subsequently rescheduled to 4:00pm.

Before turnstiles were opened, an issue was identified with the dressing panels and in order to give the Club the opportunity to rectify the situation, the decision was taken to keep the turnstiles closed. Supporter safety was of paramount importance and the Club felt that this action was necessary as a precaution.

The Club wishes to make very clear that the issues we experienced were not to do with the screen itself. Although the screen carries the ‘adi.tv’ branding the dressing panels were not installed by ADI nor a company sub-contracted by ADI.

We wish to apologise once again to everyone who suffered inconvenience as a result of this issue today and wish to place on record our particular thanks to all supporters at St James’ Park for their patience.
