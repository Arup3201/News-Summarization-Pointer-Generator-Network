Scott Brown plans to speak with Gary Mackay-Steven before he joins Celtic – to ensure the Dundee United man knows exactly what he’s getting himself into.

The Tannadice winger will move to Parkhead on a Bosman in the summer, with the outside chance of the move being advanced to this month if Celtic pay out around £200,000.

After coming up against the 24-year-old on club business and seeing him step up to become a full Scotland international, Brown believes the player has the mental strength to go with the skill required to cut it at a bigger club.

And, depending upon when the move is imminent, Brown intends to sit his future team-mate down to lay bare the realities of being a Celtic player.

‘I’ll speak to him before he turns up,’ Brown revealed. ‘I’ve met him a few times in Edinburgh because he stays there as well. He stays about five minutes up the road from me, so hopefully he can be my driver.

‘Coming to a club as big as Celtic, it takes everyone six months to understand the fan-base.

‘Even when it comes to going out to a restaurant in Glasgow, you find half the people love you and the other half hate you. It’s a big thing for newcomers to come in and accept this Rangers and Celtic divide - but I’m sure he’ll flourish.’

Brown was non-committal when asked if he’d prefer to see Mackay-Steven in Glasgow sooner rather than later.

‘That’s between the clubs, really. It would be great if he came but, if not, it’ll be great to see him at the end of the season.’

While Mackay-Steven’s arrival is now only a matter of time, Kris Commons’ immediate future is no clearer.

The 31-year-old threw his boots to the visiting fans at Hamilton on Saturday, giving rise to the conclusion he was bidding farewell after four years in Glasgow.

Ronny Deila has reiterated his belief that a long-term deal could yet be agreed - and Brown also hopes a compromise can be struck.

‘Anything can happen,’ he said. ‘Of course, we’d love him to stay but it’s between the gaffer, Peter (Lawwell) and Kris. If it doesn’t work, everyone at the club will be gutted to see him go. He’s a good character and a good guy around the changing room. He scores goals from nothing, so we’d be gutted to see him go but it’s up to him. There’s nothing anyone else can do.

‘He scored 30 goals last season and it is hard for anyone to score 30 goals in this league. He’s going to be a miss if he does go, but fingers’ crossed.’

Celtic can reclaim top place in the Premiership on Tuesday with a win against Motherwell.

Brown is expecting to have to deal with the challenge of Aberdeen at the top of the table for some time yet

However, Brown, feels the challenge of Aberdeen is something Celtic should expect to live with over the course of the next four months.

‘You’ve got to think that. But they are four points behind us if we win both games in hand, halfway through January. It’s a great challenge from them. Hamilton and Dundee United have been doing really well as well, but we haven’t heard too much about them, it’s all been about Aberdeen.’

Meanwhile, Leeds manager Neil Redfearn is interested in signing Anthony Stokes – despite the Elland Road club currently being subject to a transfer embargo.

Redfearn could yet take the Irishman to Yorkshire in the summer once the penalty the FA imposed for breaches of Financial Fair Play is lifted.
