Natalie Wood's death certificate has 
been changed to reflect some of the uncertainties surrounding the Hollywood actress' death more than 30 years ago.

The document was amended earlier 
this month and shifts Wood's death from an accidental drowning in the Pacific Ocean off Southern California to 
'drowning and other undetermined factors'.

The amended document also now 
states that the circumstances of how Wood ended up in the waters off 
Catalina Island in November 1981 are 'not clearly established'.

Actress Natalie Wood and actor Robert Wagner pose at the Dorchester Hotel in London, in 1972. Authorities amended Wood's death certificate on August 1 to reflect some of the lingering questions about how the actress died

The changes occurred nine months 
after sheriff's homicide investigators renewed their inquiry into Wood's
death shortly before its 30th anniversary.

Chief of Detectives William 
McSweeney said the decision to amend the death certificate was 
ultimately made by the coroner's office, which has been instructed by 
detectives not to discuss the case. 'I would just say undetermined is 
descriptive,' he said.

McSweeney said detectives still have work to do on the case, but that doesn't necessarily mean that a major shift is coming.

'We don't close these cases,' he 
said. 'These cases have active periods and more passive periods. We're 
moving toward the end of an active period.'

The changes to the death 
certificate were approved by Los Angeles County Chief Medical Examiner 
Dr Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran in late June, but they were not formally
recorded until August 1. The certificate wasn't made public until just 
recently.

Conflicting versions of what 
happened on the yacht shared by Wood, her actor-husband Robert Wagner 
and their friend, actor Christopher Walken, have contributed to the 
mystery of how the actress died on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981.

Natalie Wood's original death certificate was changed to alteri her cause of death to 'drowning and other undetermined factors' and adding the statement 'Circumstances not clearly established' to how Wood ended up in the water

Authorities have said Wagner is not a suspect in his wife's death. Investigators re-opened the case 
last November but have released few details about its progress.

They 
traveled to Hawaii to inspect the Splendour, the yacht the trio was 
aboard on the night of Wood's disappearance.

The renewed inquiry came after the
boat's captain, Dennis Davern, told 48 Hours Mystery and the Today 
show that he heard Wagner and Wood arguing the night of her 
disappearance and believed Wagner was to blame for her death.

Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that
he and Walken argued that night. He wrote that Walken went to bed and 
he stayed up for a while, but when he went to bed, he noticed that his 
wife and a dinghy attached to the yacht were missing.

Wagner has said through a 
spokesman that he expects the sheriff's department to conduct a fair 
investigation. An email seeking comment Tuesday was not returned.

Wood was nominated for three 
Academy Awards during her lifetime. Her death stunned the world and has 
remained one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries.

The original 
detective on the case, Wagner, Walken and until recently, the coroner's 
office, have all said they considered her death an accident.
