Liverpool are on the brink of landing one of their top summer targets after agreeing a £25million deal with Southampton for Adam Lallana.

The England international has had his heart set on a move to Merseyside since the end of last season and his wish looks set to come true now that he is on his way to Liverpool's Melwood training base to undergo a medical.

Liverpool's
 opening offer of £20million was rejected last month and they 
subsequently returned with an improved bid of £25million but were left 
wondering whether Southampton - who are due to give Bournemouth 25 per 
cent of any fee they will receive - would accept a valuation they 
had no intention of raising.

Talk
 of Lallana's future was put on hold while England's World Cup campaign 
was ongoing but the situation has accelerated since England's squad 
returned from Brazil and it could be that Lallana is a Liverpool player 
before Friday is out. If that is the case, he would join his former Saints
 team-mate Rickie Lambert at Anfield.

Liverpool's
 aim is to get their transfer business concluded swiftly and aside from 
Lambert and Lallana, they have added Germany Under-21 international Emre
 Can to the squad that finished runners-up in the Barclays Premier 
League.

That
 is unlikely to be Liverpool's last business. They want a left-back, with 
Sevilla's Alberto Moreno a target but negotiations have gone quiet for 
him. Bayern Munich's Xherdan Shaqiri is also on Liverpool's wanted list 
while the club are hopeful of beating Tottenham to Belgium 
international Divock Orgigi, too. If they can conclude a deal for the 
Lille forward, they would loan him back to the French club next season.
