Miss America has suggested officials at a Pennsylvania high school reconsider their decision to suspend a student for approaching her at a school assembly and asking her to be his prom date, the beauty queen said on Saturday.

The disciplinary action taken by school administrators in York against the 18-year-old senior made national headlines, and generated sympathy for the young man on social media.

'I was flattered by the gesture although I am unfortunately 
unable to attend due to my travel schedule. I later learned of the 
disciplinary action taken and reached out to the school in hopes that 
they will reconsider their decision,' she wrote.

Miss America said she was flattered by the gesture but just didn't have time in her schedule to make it to the prom

Miss America, Nina Davuluri, was at a high school in York, Pennsylvania when she got asked to the prom by a senior, who was then suspended for  three days for asking her the question

'Meeting and interacting with students across the country has 
been an important and rewarding part of my year as Miss America,' she added. 'I 
always encourage students to follow their dreams through education, and 
I'm inspired daily by the enthusiasm and aspirations of the bright young
 adults I have the pleasure of meeting through my travels.'

A
 video of Central York High School senior Patrick Farves approaching 
2014 Miss America Nina Davuluri on Thursday at a school assembly was 
posted on a local newspaper's website.

It shows 
Farves walking up to Davuluri bearing a plastic flower and ask her to 
his prom, as the crowd of students erupts in laughter and cheers.

Farves said he didn't consider his proposal rejected since he never got a direct answer

Administrators
 had heard rumors Farves was planning to make the bold gesture of 
approaching Davuluri and warned him not to do so, Farves said in a phone
 interview on Saturday.

'By that time, my mind was already set,' he said. 'I was already in the zone.'

Farves
 was given a three-day in-school suspension, which requires him to sit 
in a classroom and work alone.

He said he now feels bad his stunt 
overshadowed efforts by Davuluri - the first-ever Indian-American Miss 
America pageant winner - to promote diversity.

'She
 was trying to get across a very strong message - about how it's not 
about your beliefs or the color of your skin, but who you are,' he said.

Although he was warned not to by a staff member, Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America out to the prom during an appearance she made at the school, earning Farves a three-day suspension.

Farves,
 who said his mother is white and his father is black, also said he 
regretted his action because school officials worked hard to organize 
the event.

While
 he has scores of new Twitter followers and Facebook friend requests, 
Farves said he remains without a date for his school's May 10 prom.

School officials issued a statement on Central York High's Facebook page, defending the decision to suspend Farves.

'It
 is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone - even 
Miss America - to a school dance,' the statement said. 'However, it is 
our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate 
those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure 
those rules are followed within our schools.'

A
 school spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment
 on Davuluri's statement.

The high school senior student was 
suspended Thursday when he asked Miss America, Nina Davuluri, out to the
 prom when she made an appearance at the school.

Davuluri
 was at Central York High School in York, just south of the state 
capital, Harrisburg, Thursday when Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss 
America to prom during a question and answer session.

'At that point in time, it was 10 minutes before the presentation, and I was pretty much set to do it,' he said. 'I was a little pressured. Everybody expected me to do it. I'm the kind of person who, if someone says I won't do something, I'll prove people wrong. I will.'

The school, facing criticism from some who thought the administration went to far, responded on Friday afternoon.

'It is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone â€” even Miss America â€” to a school dance,' the statement from the Central York School District reads in part.

'However, it is our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure those rules are followed within our schools. This practice is not uncommon and happens every day, multiple times a day, in schools, businesses and homes across America.'

The school district also took offense to the media's reporting of the incident, saying, 'it's as shame that the media wants to frame this story to sell papers and make headlines using a distortion of what actually occurred.'

Many students, however, think the administration overreacted, and took to social media to express their feeling, using the hashtag #freepatty on Twitter.

'True diversity is when you don't punish someone for being a little bit different" @CYStudentUnion tweeted.
