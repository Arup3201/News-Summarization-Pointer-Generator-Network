Being pistol-whipped during an April robbery may have actually saved the life of Arizona man Jerimiah Willey.

After Willey suffered the beating during a robbery, a CT scan of his head revealed a massive and possibly fatal brain tumor.

Willey, a Phoenix Circle K manager, recounted the terrifying experience in an interview with Cnn affiliate KTVK.

Doctors discovered a massive tumor in Jerimiah Willey's brain after he was pistol-whipped during a robbery

'He hit me in the head twice. 
... and then throughout the whole thing, he was nudging me with the 
gun,' Willey said.

The resulting injury required eight staples, and the life-saving scan.

'They
 said that had this not been found and soon around the time that it was 
found, that he probably just would have gone to sleep one night and not 
been able to wake up,' said wife Alisha Willey.

He is now recovering from the first of what will likely be three brain surgeries.

'It's
 our understanding, that because of the size, we believe there's going 
to be two more surgeries,' said mother-in-law Rose Gould.

He is also undergoing therapy having been left with slurred speech and slight hearing loss.

A fund has been established to help pay the family's medical bills.

'It's
 hard to be thankful to somebody who was so violent,' said Alisha Willey. 'I'm just very blessed that my husband is still alive and that it 
wasn't over that morning.'
