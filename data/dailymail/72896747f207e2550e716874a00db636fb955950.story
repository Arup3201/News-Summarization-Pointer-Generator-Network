Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has resigned

Lebanon edged closer to a state of civil war today when President Michel Suleiman formally accepted the resignation of the prime minister, who stepped down blaming government infighting during a time of rising sectarian tensions. 

Prime Minister Najib Mikati submitted his
written resignation to the president after announcing he was stepping 
down the day before, taking the nation by surprise. Suleiman asked that 
his government assume a caretaking role while a new government is being 
formed.

Najib Mikati was seen by many Lebanese
as a diplomatic peace broker between the political parties, if not a 
‘sell-out’ moderate by his own Sunni group.

The Harvard-educated 
billionaire worked with Hezbollah and regularly came under fire to 
resign from the Sunni-led opposition since October of last year, when a 
security chief and nine others were killed by a car bomb in Beirut.

His resignation throws Lebanon into
uncertainty, following recent weeks of numerous car bombs, 
kidnappings and regular shoot outs between confessional groups, and threatens to leave a void in the state's highest ranks amid sporadic violence enflamed by the war in neighbouring Syria.

The atmosphere in Beirut is tense, with four tanks being moved to the Sunni heartland in 
Beirut  on Friday night just an hour before the 
resignation was announced.

They were later removed but few are able to talk of ‘inevitable’ war in a country once called the Switzerland of the Middle East.

Many fear that
the political vacuum will be replaced with wide scale sectarian murders
as Lebanon struggles to retain, officially, its ‘neutral’ stance to 
Syria’s bloodshed – a theatre of sorts which Mikati represented and 
upheld to the end.

Some believe his resignation was the result of pressure from US diplomats who have made it clear that the only way to secure peace for the country is to get Hezbollah out of the Lebanese government.

Lebanese media speculated that his decision to step down was based on ‘insinuations’ from the US and its allies to clear the way for an anti-Hezbollah majority, but Mikati in his speech denied the allegations, stressing that it was a ‘personal choice without any intervention from anyone.’ 

Soha Yazbeck, a Shia office worker, 
said: ‘This is a game which all the political groups have agreed to 
beforehand so he can be elected again as Prime minister after the 
elections. The Lebanese people expected this and resignation was his 
only option to come back’.

His resignation, some argue, could affirm that elections, in June, will take place.

Mikati
stepping down opens the way for what is expected to be prolonged 
political horse trading as parliamentary blocs try to build a majority 
coalition to choose a new prime minister.

Mikati
added after his meeting with Lebanon's president: ‘I hope that this 
resignation will provide an opening in the existing deadlock and pave 
the way for a (political) solution.'

Mikati
has been prime minister since June 2011, heading a government dominated
by the Shiite militant group Hezbollah and its allies, many of whom 
have a close relationship with Syria.

This has sparked clashes in Lebanon as many believe that Hezbollah provides the Assad regime with 
fighters who move across the border and fight Lebanese Sunnis who side with the rebels there.

The government's
main rivals is a western-backed coalition headed by former Prime 
Minister Saad al-Hariri, son of Rafik Hariri, who was also Prime 
Minister and was killed in a truck bombing in 2005.

The 57-year-old's resignation came against a backdrop of his continued battle with Hezbollah as he failed to convince the Shia militant group to keep a Sunni security chief in office and create an electoral body to oversee parliamentary elections in June.

He stepped down on Friday in protest of the parliament's inability to agree on a law to govern elections set for later this year, as well as the refusal by Hezbollah and its allies in the cabinet to extend the tenure of the country's police chief, Maj. Gen. Ashraf Rifi, who at 58 is about to hit the mandatory retirement age for his rank.

Rifi, like Mikati, is a Sunni Muslim who is considered a foe by Hezbollah.

In his speech Friday, Mikati said that if Rifi is not allowed to stay on, his departure would send the police department into ‘a vacuum.’

Underpinning the political crisis are Lebanon’s sectarian politics and the fact that the country's two largest political blocs support opposite sides in Syria's civil war.

Lebanon and Syria share a complex network of political and sectarian ties, and many fear that violence in Syria will soon spread to Lebanon.

There were signs of rising tensions before the resignation.

Gunmen who support and oppose Syrian President Bashar Assad clashed Friday in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, leaving six people dead and more than 20 wounded, according to the state-run National News Agency.

Clashes between the Sunni neighborhood of Bab Tabbaneh, which supports Syria's rebels, and the adjacent Alawite neighborhood of Jabal Mohsen, which supports Assad, have broken out repeatedly in recent months. Assad is Alawite, a Shiite offshoot sect.

Also in Tripoli, the Lebanese army said a soldier was killed and several others wounded during an army raid to capture several gunmen.

Former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, a close political ally of former Sunni PM, Saad Hariri who has frequently called for Mikati to step down, said his resignation ‘opens the possibility of fresh dialogue’ between Lebanon's political camps.

Public opinion today in Beirut was varied. Elie, 41, unemployed argued that ‘some sort of dialogue should start between [the two main political coalitions] otherwise, clashes will intensify up North and spread and no one will be able to stop it sliding into civil war’.

Elie, who didn’t wish to be identified, added that Mikati’s resignation ‘will be seen as a significant victory for Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US who want Hezbollah out of office’.
