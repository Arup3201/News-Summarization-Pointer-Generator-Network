This is the terrifying moment a man came within inches of death after crossing the tracks just one second before a 1,000-tonne freight train thunders past.

Shocking CCTV footage shows the reckless man risking his life by casually climbing over a closed barrier before strolling across two sets of tracks.

As he reaches the other side he is seen swinging one leg over the barrier just one second before the huge train hurtles past at around 40mph.

Dicing with death: CCTV still capturing the terrifying moment a man came within inches of death after crossing the tracks - just one second before a 1,000-tonne freight train thunders past

Cameras captured the incident at 3.34am on December 14 last year at a notorious level-crossing in the centre of Lincoln.

The footage was released today after plans to install a footbridge over the High Street crossing were unveiled.

Phil Verster, route managing director for Network Rail said: 'This individual had a very lucky escape and these images reinforce the need for us to take action at both level crossing sites in the city.

'We are acutely aware of this need and continue to seek the best possible solution for the High Street level crossing.'

Local dog walkers revealed the area is regularly used as a short-cut by people.

IT engineer Darren Ward, 45, from Lincoln, said: 'It's absolute madness.

Near miss: The man can be seen hooking his leg over the barrier

Clear: The train speeds away through the crossing just as the man clears the other side

'Because the freight trains take a while to clear the tracks, some people chance it by hopping over the barrier and running over the tracks.

'It is lunacy if you think that these huge trains go past at around 40mph and take a minute to go past.

Is it really worth risking your life to save a minute of time?'
