When Darlene Yasick's husband Gene died in 1989 aged 48, the family was at a loss over what had claimed him so suddenly.

Only years later did they learn he was killed by a rare and deadly genetic disease called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - and that it was only just beginning to devastate the family.

In 2006, Darlene's son Steve died aged 40 and in 2010, it claimed another son, 42-year-old Tom.

Still the disease continued to ravage her family - claiming the life of her son Michel, 49, this spring. And then on Saturday her grandson - Michael's son - Christoper passed away, aged just 25.

Heartbroken: Darlene Yasick has lost her husband, three sons and grandson to the same genetic disease

Loss: In 2006, her son Steve, 40, died followed by Tom, 42, in 2010. A third son Michel, 49, died in Spring

The family, who live in Chicago, Illinois and Wyoming, Michigan, have just learned that Darlene's six-year-old grandson also has the condition.

Speaking with WoodTV from her Michigan home, Darlene said it is like 'a nightmare and you can't wake up from it.'

All of the men suffered from the most severe form of the disorder, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which can cause the walls of the blood vessels or intestines to rupture.

The condition - for which there is no cure - can also weaken the heart's largest artery, the aorta, as well as the arteries to the kidneys and spleen.

Sudden: When her husband Gene, pictured, died in the 80s the family were not aware of the disease

Sufferers of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome have faulty collagen - which usually acts as a glue in the body - in their connective tissues. It means that EDS weakens the bonds that hold organs, vessels and arteries together.

There are six different kinds of EDS. All five of Yasick's family members who died had the Vascular Type, which is the most serious form.

It can lead to the sudden rupturing of arteries or organs as the result of even minor trauma.

There is no cure for the condition.

According to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation, the vascular form of EDS affects about one in every 250,000 people.

It is thought many more die from the disease but many victims don't know they had it. It is genetic and if you have it, there is a 50 per cent chance your children do too.

The disease affects connective tissues
such as the skin, joints and blood vessel walls and its cause is 
genetic; if you have it, there is a 50 per cent chance your children 
will have it too.

'There is no treatment,' Darlene told WoodTV. 'There is no therapy. Right now, there is nothing if you have it you have it.

'For us, it's like, what's the end? It just keeps happening and happening until there is no one left for it to happen to.'

Despite the family's struggles, she said she is proud of the men in her family and the legacy they have all left behind.

'There
is no way that I could have been prouder of them,' she said.

'Even 
though they were not here as long as we would have like them, they've 
left us with so much in memory and faith and the things they have 
accomplished.'

The family is still struggling with Christopher's death at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago on Saturday.

Fears: Darlene, pictured with Mike, said she does not know how long they will continue to lose loved ones

They
remembered him as a promising photographer who achieved a civil 
engineering degree from the University of Texas before working towards a 
structural engineering Master's degree at the University of Illinois.

His devastated grandmother is trying to stay strong during this tough time.

'If you don't have hope, then there is nothing,' she said.
