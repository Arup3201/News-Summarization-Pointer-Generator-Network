A Mississippi mother was stunned when she learned she was expecting triplets.

But the ultimate shock came when her doctor delivered four healthy babies -- identical quadruplets -- instead of three.

Kimberly Fugate had just delivered identical triplets by cesarean section when the doctor told her, 'There are more feet' and then went on to deliver a bonus baby girl.

Slim chances: The likelihood of giving birth to quadruplets, like the Fugate girls, pictured, are 1 in 729,000, but the chance of having identical babies is 'almost incalculable' -  around 13 million to 1

Mississippi woman, Kimberly Fugate, who was expecting triplets got a shock when she ended up delivering four healthy baby girls last week

Cute: When Fugate, 42, went into labor at the  University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) on February 8, she had delivered three healthy babies as expected.  But then, her doctor looked at her and said, 'More feet.'

Rare: Fugate¿s ¿surprise¿ baby wasn¿t the only thing that made her case so unusual. Fugate said her quadruplets were all identical

The baby girls ¿ Kenleigh, Kristen, Kaleigh and Kelsey ¿ were born premature at 28 weeks and will remain in the hospital until May

Mom: Kimberly Fugate, who already had one 10-year-old daughter, wasn¿t planning to have any more children

Incredibly, the fourth baby had managed to hide during the numerous ultrasounds Fugate, 42, underwent during her pregnancy.

The four girls were born February 8 at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. They were almost 13 weeks premature but are all doing well in the neonatal intensive care unit at the hospital.

Fugate's husband, Craig, had no idea there was a fourth baby until he went to visit his wife in the recovery room following the birth.

Upsizing: Fugate's husband, Craig, right, had no idea there was a fourth baby until he went to visit his wife in the recovery room following the birth. The couple also has a 10-year-old daughter, left

That's when she held up her arm and showed him four plastic identification bracelets then asked him to count, she told The Clarion-Ledger newspaper.

UMMC's director of maternal-fetal medicine Dr James Bofill said he's never seen anything like this in his 27-year career.

'I was very embarrassed, obviously,' he said. 'The news was sent to me by one of my fellows. I thought she was kidding.'

The likelihood of giving birth to quadruplets is 1 in 729,000, but the chance of having identical babies is 'almost incalculable' --  around 13 million to 1.

No more: Mrs Fugate told the Clarion-Ledger she considers the quadruple birth 'a blessing.' However, she said she doesn't plan on having any more children

Four for the price of three: Fugate's husband, Craig, had no idea there was a fourth baby until she showed him the four ID bracelets on her wrist

The Fugates, who also have a 10-year-old daughter, Katelyn, named the babies Kenleigh Rosa, Kristen Sue, Kayleigh Pearl and Kelsey Roxanne.

The premature quadruplets are expected to stay in hospital until May.

In the meantime, the family has much to organize back at home in Fayess, south Mississippi.

Mrs Fugate told the Clarion-Ledger she considers the quadruple birth 'a blessing.'

However, she said she doesn't plan on having any more children.

'This. Is. It,' she said.
