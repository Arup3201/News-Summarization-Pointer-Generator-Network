A little girl has been banned from running around with her friends because a bang to her body could kill her.

Simply by tripping and falling to the floor, Lauren Cooper could trigger a huge cyst around her neck to balloon, putting pressure on her internal organs and blocking her airway.

The eight-year-old was born with a cystic hygroma - a huge cyst on the side of her face, neck and chest.

Lauren Cooper, eight, was born with a cystic hygroma - a huge cyst on the side of her face, neck and chest. It was so big that it forced her tongue out of her mouth

The cyst was so big that it took up the space where her tongue should be, meaning that it could not fit inside her mouth.

Although the growth was removed when Lauren was a baby, part of the cyst remains and can balloon and become infected if it is aggravated.

Lauren’s mother, Sara Cooper, 40, said: ‘If Lauren has a knock or bang, it can cause swelling which may block her airway.

‘Anything where she might get hit or fall over she can’t do so she cannot play sports and has to constantly be aware of things around her.

‘Even eating peppers or chillies can trigger an attack and it causes her immense pain.’

A cystic hygroma is a collection of fluid-filled sacs, known as cysts, that result from a malformation in the lymphatic system.

Every time Lauren's cyst is aggravated, her parents have to take her to hospital for a scan and it can take her up to eight weeks to recover. She is pictured during treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital

A cystic hygroma is a collection of fluid-filled sacs, known as cysts, that result from a malformation in the lymphatic system.

The lumps can develop anywhere in the body but are most commonly found in the neck and armpits.

They form when the lymph vessels fail to develop properly during the first few weeks of pregnancy.

The cysts are particularly problematic if they fill with fluid, or if they become infected.

They are often surgically removed but can come back after treatment.

Lauren was just 18-months-old when 
she underwent major surgery to remove the enormous cyst, which stretched
from her cheekbone down to her chest.

The operation involved making an incision right around her neck before pulling the skin back.

Lauren (pictured with her mother, Sara Cooper) had most of the cyst removed when she was a baby but some still remains and can cause problems

Her father, Steven Cooper, 42, said: ‘It was a very tough time for us.

‘One of the main risks of the operation was paralysis but there was never really an option.

Lauren (pictured with her sister, Jessica, six) had to have further surgery to have her tongue reconstructed because it was still too swollen to fit inside her mouth properly

‘The cyst affected everything and it was very uncomfortable for her.

‘It leaked fluid and blood through the night and her dressings would constantly need to be changed.’

After regular treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, Lauren was finally allowed back home to Bolton, Greater Manchester.

Lauren now faces a daily battle to fight the condition, in the hope that further cysts won't develop

However, her tongue was so swollen that she could not keep it in her mouth and so she required a further operation to reconstruct it.

Her mother said: ‘If she has a bang or gets an infection and we suspect she has a relapse, we have to take her into hospital and wait for a scan.

‘It can take her around eight weeks to recover, and we have to keep going back to monitor her.’
