A well-to-do New York heroin addict who, with his then-pregnant trust-fund-baby girlfriend, was caught with a cache of weapons and bomb-making equipment in December will serve a reduced seven-year prison sentence as part of a plea deal.

Aaron Greene, 32, pleaded guilty to a single charge of attempted felony weapons possession in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday and his disappointed parents attended the hearing.

The 32-year-old had faced 10 years behind bars after police found terrorist handbooks, two shotguns, 60 shotgun shells, knives and seven grams of the explosive HMTD in the apartment he shared with girlfriend Morgan Gliedman.

But he agreed to the plea deal, shaving three years off his sentence although the agreement also includes five years of supervised probation.

Guilty: Aaron Greene, 32, pictured here in January, pleaded guilty to a single charge of attempted felony weapons possession in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday

Gliedman, who later had a baby girl, Melody Sunshine, is still awaiting trial.

'Our client wished to accept responsibility for his conduct and put this unfortunate chapter behind him,' defense lawyer Isabelle Kirshner told The New York Post of Greene, who will be formally sentenced on September 4.

The questionable couple were arrested in December for allegedly keeping explosives in their Greenwich Village apartment and plotting to blow up the arch in nearby Washington Square Park.

Friends allegedly told police that Greene had previously tested explosives in the Manhattan public park.

The friends report that Greene was seen sprinkling powder on the ground before throwing rocks at it to see if it would explode is in keeping with police theories that the couple were stocking up on highly unstable explosives in order to stage an attack.

The New York Times reported in January that police interviewed Daniel Whittaker, a friend of Greene's who lives in upstate New York.

Mr Whittaker, who is a corrections officer, was questioned because Greene told investigators he had given some weapons to 'a friend in law enforcement'.

The main focus of the investigation, however, has been the apartment Greene and Gliedman lived in while she was pregnant with their child. Gliedman, 27, went into labor during her arrest and because she stopped doing heroin during her pregnancy, the child was born drug free.

Inside the apartment, officers found 
seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the 
substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings.

Target: Greene was allegedly seen sprinkling powder around the arch in Washington Square and watching it explode

Dangerous: The NYPD bomb squad was called in to remove the explosive that was discovered in the couple Greenwich Village apartment

The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive.

Police
also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a $1,000 Ruger over-under hunting 
shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a 
replica of an M203 grenade launcher.

Several disturbing items were seized, 
including: 'The Terroristâ€™s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and 
Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself 
Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby 
traps and explosives.

Officers
were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and 
Greene in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to 
their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported.

'Junkies': Morgan Gliedman, 27, and Aaron 
Greene, 31, are both admitted heroin addicts - even though Gliedman was 
heavily pregnant when the explosives were found at their apartment, 
police say

The
apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street is near the apartment where
two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb 
for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970.

Greene
and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources said at the time. They said the pair were just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' 
according to the Daily Beast.

Friends revealed to the New York Post
that Gliedman, a former student of New York prep school Dalton, was on a
safe track to success until she met Greene, who has a series of felony 
weapons charges to his name.

She went to New York University and then attended the Art Institute of Chicago for a masters in Creative Writing.

'She
comes from a great family, raised on Park Avenue, went to a great 
school, but then this guy introduced her to drugs,' a friend told the 
Post.

They added that Gliedman stopped doing heroin when she learned she was pregnant, and the baby was born drug-free.

The newborn, named Melody Sunshine, is now being cared for by
Gliedman's mother, Susyn Schops Gliedman, a broker, and father, Dr. 
Paul Gliedman, head of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Brooklyn.

'She wants to get clean. She wants to address this legal issue. She wants to raise her daughter,' said celebrity bail bondsman Ira Judelson, who posted Gliedman's bail, in January.

Following
the arrest, it emerged that the 27-year-old was already a suspect in a 
robbery - and already on probation for drug possession.

real estate agent

On February 17, Gliedman met a man at
Johnny's Bar in the Village and went to his Midtown apartment where she
allegedly took off with a backpack containing his laptop, cellphone, 
wallet and credit cards, which she used to make purchases.

Five days after the robbery, on 
February 22, she and her Harvard-graduate boyfriend, Greene, were 
arrested for possession drugs and found with a .223-caliber rifle.

The
couple were spotted with another woman in a car and Greene was seen 
injecting heroin while one of the women snorted the drug, a criminal 
complaint said.

Police 
officers found empty heroin bags on the floor, marijuana and a digital 
scale with heroin residue in one of the women's handbags, according to 
The Post, and Greene admitted to having a gun.

He was sentenced to five months in 
jail. Greene's
father is the head of a top art restoration firm.
