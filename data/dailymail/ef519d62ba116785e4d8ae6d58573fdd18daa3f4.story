Parts of storm-battered Britain have suffered the greatest loss of trees in a generation, the National Trust has said.

The worst-hit areas have suffered up to 15 storms over the last three months, losing thousands of trees that have stood for decades.

This winter has been the wettest for 250 years, with a relentless series of vicious storms sweeping in from the Atlantic.

Winds of up to 40mph have blasted the nation’s coastlines since December, tearing across the country and creating untold devastation.

The greatest losses have been among ancient oak, ash and beech trees, experts said, with damage to some woodlands the greatest since the Great Storm of 1987.

But given the extent of the wild weather, which hit the western half of England, Wales and Northern Ireland particularly badly, losses could have been worse, the National Trust said.

The charity has surveyed more than 50 of its sites, with many gardeners, rangers and foresters saying that the losses of trees has been the greatest since 1987.

Killerton Estate in Devon suffered some of the biggest losses, with more than 500 trees blown over, including 20 that were significant to the estate’s landscaping.

Specimen trees have been badly damaged or blown over in gardens and parks, particularly in south-west England and Wales, but gardens outside the west have also suffered, with Tatton Park near Manchester, Nymans in Sussex and Scotney Castle in Kent all affected.

Stourhead in Wiltshire lost 400 trees, including a 250-year-old oak planted by the man who created the landscaped garden.

Historically important trees have been lost, including a rare black walnut at Hatfield Forest, which was the largest in Essex.

Matthew Oates, the trust’s nature and wildlife specialist, described the lost ancient trees as ‘nature’s cathedrals’.

One of the reasons for the extensive damage was the heavy rain which accompanied the storms, he said, creating waterlogged ground and increasing the chance they would be toppled.

Mr Oates said: ‘Too many old beech, oak and ash trees have been lost. These are important habitats, for bats, beetles, flies and fungi, though a whole series of species colonise and utilise them once they fall, and drive the rotting down process.

‘People love and need trees, and the loss of specimen trees in gardens and parks, and of ancient beeches and oaks in the woods and wider countryside, hurts us all and damages much wildlife.

‘We value and venerate these old sentinels and need to become increasingly aware of the power of the weather.

‘Increased storminess, and increased extreme weather events generally, are likely to stress trees further, especially veteran trees. We will have to think carefully about where we establish trees and what species we plant.’

The Woodland Trust, which looks after 1,000 woodland sites across the country, echoed the National Trust’s comments.

A spokesman said staff are still assessing the extent of the devastation. He added: ‘We are still finding damage but at we’ve spent about £200,000 on clearing up our sites.’
