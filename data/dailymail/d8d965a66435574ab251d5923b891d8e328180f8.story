Hundreds gathered in the capital of Afghanistan today to attend the burial of a 27-year-old woman who was murdered by an angry mob for allegedly burning a copy of the Koran.

Farkhunda was beaten to death and her body set on fire by a large group of men outside a mosque in central Kabul on Thursday, in full view of several policemen.

As her coffin was carried through the crowd by family members and women's rights activists, Afghanistan's top criminal investigator claimed Farkhunda had been wrongly accused.

A leading investigator has today said that there is no evidence to support the claims that the 27-year-old Islamic studies teacher had burned the Koran

Mobile phone footage from the incident this week shows the all-male mob attacking Farkhunda in broad daylight, beating her to death with sticks and bricks before being set on fire.

'Last night I went through all documents and evidence once again, but I couldn't find any evidence to say Farkhunda burnt the Holy Koran,' General Mohammad Zahir told reporters at her funeral.

'Farkhunda was totally innocent.'

General Zahir promised to 'punish all those involved', adding that 13 people, including eight police officers, had already been arrested.

Members of Farkhunda's family has today denied reports that she was mentally ill, claiming this was a made-up defence to protect her reputation.

Her father said the 27-year-old worked as an Islamic studies teacher studies and could recite the Koran by heart. He insisted she was not involved in burning the Muslim holy book.

'Farkhunda was a deeply religious girl. She used to recite the holy Koran and pray five times a day,' her brother Najeebullah Malikzada said today.

Farkhunda's funeral was attended by dozens of women's rights activists, several of whom also helped carry her coffin, demanding justice for the young teacher.

'This is a crime against this family, a crime against a sister and a crime against humanity,' said Bari Salam, a human rights activist.

'All those involved and all those who supported her killing should be brought to justice,' he said. 

President Ashraf Ghani condemned the killing as 'heinous' and ordered a commission to investigate the incident.

He said police, who play a crucial part in the war against Taliban insurgents, were not well-trained to contain such incidents.

The mob could be seen stamping on the woman while some stamped on her repeatedly and battered her body with pieces of wood and bricks

'Almost 90 per cent of the duties of the police today are focused on fighting, which is not their constitutional role, it is not their legal role,' Ghani told reporters on Saturday.

'Focusing on civilian capabilities, on enforcement of the rule of law, is key to us.'

In a statement on Sunday, the interior ministry said 13 police officers were suspended, including the police chief responsible for the area.

Police separately said they arrested 21 people, including eight policemen.

'I will question the police... we have started our inquiry,' General Zahir Zahir, head of criminal investigation at the interior ministry, said today.

'Even If I get killed, I won't let any of her perpetrators get away with it,' he added.
