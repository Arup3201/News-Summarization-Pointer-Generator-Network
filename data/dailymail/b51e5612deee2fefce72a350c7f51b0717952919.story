Tory grandee Nicholas Soames last night refused to apologise for launching a four-letter tirade of abuse at rebel Conservative MP Adam Afriyie in the Commons Tea Room.

Shocked fellow MPs looked on as Mr Soames, grandson of wartime leader Winston Churchill, tore into Windsor MP Mr Afriyie over his plan to force David Cameron to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU before the next Election.

Mr Soames told Eurosceptic  Mr Afriyie: ‘You are a chateau bottled nuclear powered ****. You are totally f***ing disloyal, a f***ing disgrace to your party, your fellow MPs, your Prime Minister and your country.’

Tea room row: Shocked fellow MP's looked on as the grandson of Winston Churchill launched a foul mouthed tirade at Windsor MP Adam Afriyie

Mr Afriyie hit back: ‘If you want to have a serious discussion, Nicholas, then I am prepared to do so. But this  is not the way to go about it.’

Tory whip Amber Rudd tried to stop the row last Tuesday afternoon, saying: ‘This is not doing any good for anyone.’

But Mr Soames refused to be silenced and told Mr Afriyie: ‘This  is nothing more than a grotesque f***ing vanity project to promote your absurd f***ing campaign to become party leader. You aren’t up to it, man!’

The clash between pro-European  Old Etonian Mr Soames and Mr Afriyie, brought up by a single mother on a council estate in South London, shocked onlookers. ‘You could hear the shouting and swearing from one end of the tea room to the other,’ said one.

Mr Soames’s colourful ‘chateau’ phrase is believed to have originated in Anthony Powell’s series of novels  A Dance To The Music Of Time. In the final book, Hearing Secret Harmonies, the character Widmerpool is described as a ‘chateau-bottled s**t’.

Not backing down: Eurosceptic Mr Afriyie has made it clear he will not be cowed by Mr Soames and said he woukld not be bullied into submission

Mr Soames told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘Yes, I was very robust in what I said to him, and yes, I did swear, but I have no regrets. I feel very angry about what Afriyie has done. He has made no secret of the fact that he is running a putative leadership campaign against the PM. Hardly a single MP supports him. 

‘The Tory Party was totally united at
 its party conference a few weeks ago. But within days Afriyie tried to 
blow that unity sky-high with his nonsense referendum idea. What really 
worries me is all the hard-working Conservative MPs who could lose their
 seats as a result of his ludicrous and deeply irresponsible antics.’

One
 Tory MP who witnessed the exchange said: ‘Nick’s barrack room language 
was over the top but the vast majority of us agree with him. Adam is 
being totally reckless and is in danger of becoming a pariah among his 
colleagues. It is totally impractical to have a referendum next year.’

But
 a defiant Mr Afriyie made it clear last night he would not be cowed by 
Mr Soames. He refused to comment on the blow-up but criticised the 
‘vicious backlash’ against him and said he would not be ‘bullied’ into 
backing down.

He claimed he had widespread 
public support for his demand for an EU referendum in 2014, not in 2017,
 as promised by Mr Cameron if he wins the next Election.

Self-made millionaire Mr Afriyie is determined to force MPs to vote on the issue on November 8, less than three weeks away. ‘I have received hundreds of supportive letters and emails from people across the country,’ he said. ‘Their message is clear: fight on.

‘As an MP it is my job to suggest changes to legislation and it is important nobody is bullied out of doing so.’

The attacks on him showed the ‘political establishment’ did not want ordinary voters to have a say on whether Britain should stay in the EU.
