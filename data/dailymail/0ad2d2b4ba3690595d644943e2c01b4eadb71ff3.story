They are probably not top of most people’s must-have list, but gifts on sale this year include empty boxes and rhinoceros dung.

Waitrose is selling the empty wooden crates, priced at £10 and £15, for shoppers to fill with food, drink and other items to create a gift tailored to a friend or relative.

It says the boxes come with a gift label and ‘plenty of wood wool stuffing to nestle the goodies into’, adding: ‘They make useful storage boxes after Christmas too.’

And for the keen gardener who already has all the tools they need, the Natural History Museum has an offering that will certainly stand out on Christmas Day.

Their ‘rhino poo in a box’ gift set promises to be the ‘ideal environment’ to cultivate the seeds of a banana plant (included), which you can then transfer out into your garden.

It is collected from rhinos living in British zoos and specially treated to kill germs and bad odours.

And at just £5 it’s the perfect treat for your not so favourite relative - even if they don’t have a garden.

Guinevere Short, retail operations manager at the Natural History Museum, said many of their bestselling gifts appealed to the ‘silliness’ of British present giving.

She said: ‘I can say the rhino poo in a box is one of our most popular stocking fillers without a doubt.

‘We also do elephant poo and also reindeer poo which you can grow roses in - that is particularly popular this time of year.

‘I think gifts like that appeal to the British love of scatological humour and silliness, everyone seems to think it is funny.

‘We have definitely made a conscious decision to broaden our efforts especially with regard to adult gifts which previously were quite neglected.

‘We realised we were very lucky here to have the whole of the natural world as our mood board so we have been really capitalising on that to great effect.

‘Now we have dinosaur baubles for the Christmas tree, bone shaped Jenga sets and even an anatomically correct heart pendant.’

Other museums and galleries have widened their giftshop ranges this festive season to appeal to shoppers bored of the high street.

Unusual items on offer include an Elizabeth I wine glass lampshade, £7 from the National Portrait Gallery, which transforms a wine glass into a tealight holder.

While the Natural History museum is selling a felt elephant head, £75, as a friendlier alternative to the more traditional stag’s antlers.

And for the person who really does have everything, the V&A has a blue crystaled spot LED lightbulb in its half-price pre-Christmas sale for £87.50.
