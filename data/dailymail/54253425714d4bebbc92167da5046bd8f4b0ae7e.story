Nearly half of Britons think at least one anti-Semitic view presented to them was 'definitely or probably true', a survey has revealed.

One in eight said they thought Jews talked about the Holocaust to get sympathy, the poll found.

One in four believed Jewish people 'chase money more than others', while one in six felt Jews thought they were better than other people and had too much power in the media.

Jewish organisations in Britain have called for a zero tolerance approach to anti-semitism

The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism (CAA), which commissioned the YouGov study, said the findings were a 'shocking wake-up call' and warned that anti-Semitism would grow unless it was met by 'zero tolerance'. The group said the survey also revealed that people who said they would vote Ukip in the General Election 'consistently believed more anti-Semitic statements to be true', by an average margin of nine per cent.

Some 269,000 Jewish people live in Britain, or 0.4 per cent of the population, according to the CAA.

Last year saw the most anti-Semitic incidents recorded by police since records began 30 years ago, the campaign said.

Chairman Gideon Falter said: 'The results of our survey are a shocking wake-up call straight after the atrocities in Paris. Britain is at a tipping point.'

The survey found that one in four Britons think Jewish people chase money more than others while one in six claimed that Jews thought they were better than others and had too much power in the media.

One in ten said Jews were not has honest in business and one in five said they questioned their loyalty to Britain due to their connection with Israel. Ten percent of those questioned would not be happy if a relative married a Jew.   

In a separate survey carried out by the CAA, more than half of British Jews feared they had no future in the UK and a quarter said they have considered leaving the country in the last two years.

The poll of 2,230 British Jews found 56 per cent felt that anti-Semitism now echoes the 1930s, while 58 per cent believed Jews may have no long-term future in Europe.

Some 45 per cent felt their family was threatened by Islamist extremism, while 63 per cent thought authorities let too much anti-Semitism go unpunished.

Mr Falter added: 'Britain is at a tipping point. Unless anti-Semitism is met with zero tolerance, it will grow and British Jews will increasingly question their place in their own country. Britain's Jews must be shown that they are not alone.'

Communities secretary Eric Pickles said British society would be diminished without Jewish people 

Jonathan Sacerdoti, who is also from the campaign, said: 'Jewish people have contributed to almost every part of British life, yet rising anti-Semitism here and across Europe means that now more than ever Jews are afraid. Some are even reconsidering their future here.

'British values of tolerance and pluralism must be upheld, so that minority groups like Jews feel comfortable and protected.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'Jews are an important part of the British community, and we would be diminished without them.

'Anyone who peddles anti-Semitic views is attacking Britain and British values.

'This Government has done much to enhance Britain's status as a safe, tolerant place for Jewish people but we are not complacent. We remain committed to tackling it wherever and whenever it occurs and continue to take a zero-tolerance approach.

'Those who commit hate crimes will be punished with the full force of the law.'

A Jewish mother who moved to the UK a decade ago said she no longer discusses her religion with new people she meets amid fears about a rise in anti-Semitism.

Mother-of-three Aurelie, who is originally from France, arrived in Britain with her husband and said anti-Semitism is so widespread in her homeland that the family has decided not to move back.

'I know I will never go back to France,' the 37-year-old said.

'You've seen the news last week. That's how my country is getting, worse and worse.'

Aurelie, who did not wish to give her surname, said her mother is a teacher and 'she gets bullied (about her religion) in the school, by the children. It's a primary school.'

She added: 'When people ask about my background I don't say I'm French-Jewish any more. I just say I'm French.'

Last month, Aurelie made the decision to cover up the Jewish school uniforms worn by her two older children - aged seven and 10 - and has gently asked them not to volunteer information about their religion to other youngsters.

For now, she says, she is happy living in London and proud to call herself British.

'But if there is an attack on Jewish people here in the future we'd consider moving to America,' she added.

Aurelie hopes local authorities will do more to make British Jews feel safe.

'That's what they didn't do in France,' she said.

'The only way to keep the Jewish community here is to make them feel safe and make them feel they can be themselves.'
