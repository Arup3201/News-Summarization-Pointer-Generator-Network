Families where both parents work will be given £1,200 a year per child from 2015 to help with nursery fees, the Government confirmed in the Budget.

But the policy has been called 'nanny subsidies for the well-heeled' as mothers who choose to stay at home to look after their children will receive nothing.

The childcare tax break is only for parents who both go out to work and earn a joint income of up to £300,000.

Blow to middle class mothers: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne delivering his Budget to the House of Commons

Working parents will be able to claim back 20 per cent of their nursery, childminder or nanny costs up to a total of £1,200 per child.

Many middle-class single-earner families on £50,000 have already had their child benefit taken away.

Describing
the scheme as 'a slap in the face for two million stay at home mothers'
Lynne Burnham of the campaign group Mothers at Home Matter said it was 
'completely incongruous' to offer tax breaks to working families on 
nearly £300,000 while taking child benefit from single-earner families 
on just £50,000.

Others 
expressed frustration that the Government had failed to introduce a 
married couples' tax break – something which was promised in the 
Conservative manifesto.

Ministers said they hoped the new scheme would encourage low and middle income earners to work full-time.

They claimed many women are put off going back to work after having children because of the costs of childcare.

But
campaigners have described the scheme as 'a slap in the face' for stay 
at home mothers. The new childcare subsidies have also come under fire 
for delaying assistance until autumn 2015.

George
Osborne insisted the policy would help 2.5 million families, including 
those whose employers are not part of the existing childcare voucher 
scheme.

New parents Paul Stokes and his wife Carmen have welcomed the new child care tax break.

The benefit, worth £1,200 per child per year, will enable Mrs Stokes to return to work full-time rather than part-time.

Mrs Stokes is currently on maternity leave after having Brooke, who is four months old, but she is keen to get back to her job.

The 34-year-old works as a manager  of a community safety team for Suffolk Council and earns £46,000 a year.

Her husband also earns £46,000 a year as a service manager of a sports department for Suffolk Council.

Although the couple normally earn a combined income of nearly £100,000 a year, they are still entitled to receive child benefit of £81 a month.

And now with the added benefit of  subsidised childcare, the couple will be even better off.

Mr Stokes says: 'One of our biggest worries is childcare so any relief is great.

'Carmen is currently on maternity leave, but is supposed to be going back to full-time work in November, which means she would have taken a year off if we can afford it.'

Mr Stokes says that if the £1,200 a year tax break had been introduced sooner than the proposed 2015 date, his wife probably would have returned to work sooner.

Instead she will spend the next few months being a full-time mother to her young son.

Mr Stokes said he thought the new scheme would probably encourage some people to not take their full maternity allowance on a lower pay.

He also said it will help his wife work full-time in two years time when Brooke is two-and-a-half and the scheme is introduced.

He added: 'The extra money means the difference between going back part-time and going back full-time.

'It would take the pressure off for us.'

As public sector workers, both Mr Stokes and his wife have had a pay freeze for the last two years which is to be extended for another two years.

The couple have savings in ISAs with Chelsea Financial Services.

'To the working parents struggling with the costs of childcare and the mother wondering whether it makes financial sense to get a job, we offer this: tax free childcare,' Mr Osborne said.

But others pointed out that those with children older than five,  or families with stay-at-home parents, usually mothers - will miss out, meaning 860,000 families with children will not benefit.

Earlier this week a government briefing document, claiming that mothers who stayed at home did not need as much financial support as those who work, was published on the Treasury's website.

The document, which was later removed,
fuelled claims that the new childcare scheme is discriminating against 
the traditional family.

To lift Britain out of the economic mire, the Chancellor's 2013 Budget unveiled measures aimed at restoring the ‘Aspiration Nation’ of the Tory 1980s. They included:

The most eye-catching measure was the ‘help to buy’ scheme for those struggling to find mortgage deposits. It will mean £3.5billion becoming available for shared equity loans worth 20 per cent of the value of a new build house worth up to £600,000.

Other measures included a new flat-rate state pension worth £144 a week and a £72,000 cap on elderly care bills.

Automatic pay rises for public sector workers paid simply for time served will be scrapped, with only the armed forces exempted. Public sector workers will also have to pay more in national insurance contributions.

Simon Bower and his wife Caroline, from Sheffield, with their two children

Simon Bower believes he and his wife Caroline, a stay at home mother-of-two, have been penalised for having 'traditional Tory values'.

They lost out on around £2,000 a year in child benefit because Mr Bower's business was bringing him in over £50,000 a year.

Now they have now been left empty-handed, while parents who both go out to work are handed tax breaks worth up to £1,200 a year towards the cost of their childcare. 

Mr Bower, 43, who owns a coffee roasters called Pollards in Sheffield, said: 'Last year we lost child benefit and we didn't mind as we believed we are all in this together.

'But now I'm on £50,000 as the sole earner and my family get nothing back from the Government, unlike two people earning who would be thousands of pounds better off. Osborne said this is a

Budget for hard workers. But a stay at home mum, who I believe is doing the most important job, presumably is not classed as a hard worker.

'It would seem we are no longer in it together.'

Mrs Bower, 39, gave up her job as an assistant head teacher to look after their two children, Emily, six, and two-year-old Naomi, full-time.

Yesterday the Centre for Policy Studies, the think tank started by Iain Duncan Smith, criticised the Government for  undermining the traditional family by restricting help to dual income households.

Spokesman Kathy Gyngell said: 'Introducing a transferable tax allowance would have gone some way to rectifying the state's punitive treatment of marriage and one-earner families.

'But channelling the hard earned taxes of one-earner families into nanny subsidies for the well-heeled, politicians and their working wives that represent the Coalition have made matters profoundly worse.'

Dan Boucher, from the social charity CARE, said the Government's help to two-income families 'will simply exacerbate the unfairness already experienced by single-earner households within the tax system'.

He added: 'For one-earner households earning just over the average wage it is even more  critical that the Government honours its commitment to  support them through transferable allowances, as promised in the Coalition Agreement.'

Tory MP Nick de Bois said: 'I can see why families with one parent who stays at home doing a really important job would be disappointed, but I hope they will take some comfort from other measures in the Budget to help hard-working parents.'

He added: 'I hope with the remaining two Budgets in this parliament we get to see a return to the tax system supporting transferable allowances between married couples.'

Nick Pearce, director of the centre-right IPPR think tank said: 'The new tax relief scheme will also be broadly regressive, giving more to families on higher incomes than those lower down the income distribution.

'It will leave the distribution of government funding for childcare with a U-shape: households on low incomes will qualify for tax credits and the better-off will qualify for tax reliefs, with less going to families in the middle.'

As part of the reforms, the  Government is phasing out the current childcare voucher scheme, which offers tax breaks for working parents to help with the costs of after-school care for the under-15s.
