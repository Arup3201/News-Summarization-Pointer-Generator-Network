A row between the Labour party and the White House has escalated after Harriet Harman accused Barack Obama of 'not really knowing what is going on'.

Labour is furious at the US President's endorsement of David Cameron and the Tory economic election strategy less than four months before the election.

Launching her second attack on Mr Obama, Labour's deputy leader insisted he had been wrong to suggest that Britain 'must be doing something right' after strong economic growth.

Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted the US President had been wrong to suggest that Britain 'must be doing something right' after strong economic growth

Mr Cameron flew to Washington last week for a two-day visit, his last as Prime Minister before the election.

The President hailed the British Prime Minister as a 'great friend' and said the US and UK economies were 'standing out' on the world stage.

The remarks caused dismay in Labour ranks, who have traditionally had closer ties with the Democrats.

Mr Obama was asked whether Britain should 'stick to the plan' and if Mr Cameron is 'right' over his plans for the economy.

The President replied: 'I would note that Great Britain and the United States are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems. So we must be doing something right.'

On Sunday Ms Harman said Mr Obama had been 'wrong' not to reflect on the impact of crash on personal incomes.

Last night she went further, and took a highly unusual swipe at the US President, traditionally seen as Britain's closest ally.

Ms Harman told LBC Radio: 'If he was saying David Cameron has run the economy in a good way, the impact it will have is most people will feel that Obama does not really know what is going on in this country, and doesn't know that although the figures might show there has been an economic recovery, most people don't feel better off.

'For Obama to say David Cameron is right and everything is fine, I think people will just disagree with President Obama, and think of their own experience. People know their pay have stagnated, and costs have gone up.

'Whatever Cameron or Obama say, the Tories have not run the economy well, and people have lost out, unless you are the very top and have had an absolute bonanza.'

Privately senior Labour figures are dismayed at the backing from the US, especially after Ed Miliband hired a senior Obama aide to advise his election campaign.

Many in the Labour party had hoped the appointment of Obama election guru David Axelrod would help to secure support from the White House.

'I'm not quite sure why we're paying Axelrod £300,000,' one Labour frontbencher told the Sunday Times. 'We should ask for our money back.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband had hoped that a visit to the White House last year, and a meeting with President Obama, would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for Mr Cameron ahead of the election

The Obama endorsement of Mr Cameron came after it emerged the US President refers to the Prime Minister privately as his 'bro'.

At a press conference on Friday, the President 'Let me put this speculation to rest: put simply, David is a great friend. He is one of my closest and most trusted partners in the world.

'On many of the challenges we face... we see the world the same way.

'Great Britain is our indispensable partner - and David personally an outstanding partner.'

Mr Miliband had hoped that a visit to the White House last year, and a meeting with President Obama, would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for Mr Cameron ahead of the election.
