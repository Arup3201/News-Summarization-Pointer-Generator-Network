Baby Caralyn will never get to meet her mother, but the actions of the Iowa woman's best friend will leave the little girl in no doubt as to how much she was loved and wanted.

When gym instructor Laura Yoho was told she had brain cancer, the 30-year-old and her husband, Nate, were determined to still have a family together.

The couple had just got engaged at the end of 2010, when Laura was diagnosed with having brain tumors after she passed out at the gym.

Laura had eggs frozen before starting treatment and, when the couple decided they were ready for a baby, her best friend Kara Stetson offered to act as a surrogate.

Tragically, Laura died just four months before her daughter was born, but the actions of Kara means that Laura's family and friends have something positive to hold on to as they remember her.

'It's such an amazing gift. There are no words that could possibly recreate what she's done for myself and my family,' Nate said.

Kara said: 'I just felt so happy that there was 
something I could do for her family and his family, and selfishly for 
me, to keep a part of Laura alive on this Earth.'

'Laura and I are very close so I think it came easy to both of us, the idea,' she added.

After Caralyn's birth Des Moines Register reporter Daniel Finney wrote an open letter to the baby,  telling her about her mother and how Kara helped bring her into the world.

Gift: Best friend Kara Stetson offered to carry Laura and Nate's baby

It starts: 'You’re barely a month old now, too young to read this letter. But one day soon, someone will show you this, and maybe it will help you understand the wonderful confluence of love and hope that brought you into this world.'

In the open letter to Caralyn, the baby girl is told how her parents met and fell in love, about their wedding day, and also the moment they discovered Laura had cancer.

Laura first learned that she had brain tumors after passing out at a gym in 2010, a few weeks after the couple got engaged.

Originally doctors thought she had suffered a stroke, but as the symptoms persisted the couple sought a second opinion.

Despite her illness, Laura continued with her active life and never stopped to fell sorry for herself.

When she and Nate decided to try for a baby, her best friend Kara didn't think twice about offering to carry it for them.

Kara is quoted in the letter as saying: 'It’s hard to explain what having a best friend like Laura for 24 years meant to me. We were different enough and alike enough to get along perfectly. We never argued. We never got sick of one another. We were like sisters, soul mates and a best friend all rolled into one.'

The letter recalled the lighter moments of the surrogacy experience, telling Caralyn that Kara's children would get mixed up with the story, telling friends their mom was having another man's baby, which led to 'some fast explaining'.

Making it clear that Laura was fighting to keep the disease at bay so she could meet her daughter, the letter recalls the moment Laura died, peacefully, shortly after having her baby shower.

Fighter: Laura found out she had brain tumors after passing out at the gym

Hope: A brain scan from December last year showed the tumors, shown as a white mass, had reduced from the previous scan, far right

Memories: Laura and Nate on their wedding day. Despite undergoing several operations Laura still looked radiant and was determined not to let the disease hold her back

'Everyone was so sad. Your mom was 
gone,' he wrote. 'But there was hope. You were coming. Your dad 
anticipated your arrival every day. He grieved for his lost love, but he
 prepared for his new one - you - just as hard.'

After Caralyn was born, Nate and his baby stayed with Kara's family for a few days as he settled into his role as a dad.

'Caralyn's birth was certainly up and 
down,' he told the Des Moines Register. 'I wish my wife was here but the joy of having [Caralyn] here, I
 know she wouldn't want me to be sad.'

He will make sure Laura remains a big part of their lives, and has plenty of photos of videos of the couple, including a reenactment of the moment he proposed to Laura.

While still grieving for his wife, who died on July 23, Nate is also able to look to the future thanks to baby Caralyn, who was born on November 26.

'Part of it's having a little bit of my wife back ... I can see her when my daughter smiles,' he said.
