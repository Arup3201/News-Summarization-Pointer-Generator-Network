For Heather Watson, the strain of bearing British hopes at Wimbledon manifests itself in strange ways. On Tuesday it was a case of lockjaw.

Nerves meant the resurgent British No 1 was so uptight she was not just Sleepless in SW19, which is normal for her, but also incapable of opening her mouth ahead of her first round.

Happily the anxiety evaporated once she walked on court to meet Croatia’s highly rated Ajla Tomljanovic, and she was able to avoid the possibility of a Tuesday wipeout for the host nation with an ultimately comfortable 6-3, 6-2 victory.

The overmatched Dan Smethurst and 
Samantha Murray were never likely to register a tick on the credit 
ledger for GB but the 22-year-old Channel Islander was burdened with 
expectation, especially in the absence of Laura Robson.

‘I
 was a bit nervous and struggled to eat before I went on, actually my 
jaw was locking and I couldn’t even bite through my banana,’  said a 
beaming Watson after her match.

‘It’s
 just tension, I always get nervous but sometimes more than others and 
that’s never happened before. I didn’t sleep that great last night, I 
woke up at 4am, and I was ready to go. I did actually manage to get back
 to sleep for a bit. The sleeping thing is normal, more since I have 
been ill (with the glandular fever that helped wreck last season for 
her). So it’s usually just that and struggling to eat.’

The
 slump of 2013 means she has almost no points to defend between now and 
the end of the year, so with the way she is playing there can be every 
expectation that Watson will soon break back into the top 50.

That
 process would be accelerated if she could somehow defeat ninth seed 
German Angelique  Kerber tomorrow. Watson’s mantra is that anyone can 
beat anyone in women’s tennis right now, so that outcome is just about 
possible.

Next round here I come: Watson has been in fine form in recent weeks, and faces Kerber next

Fair game: Watson and Tomiljanovic shake hands at the end of the match

You know you will 
get nothing less than wholehearted fight from the newly attacking 
version of Watson, and that showed through in her ability to fend off 
break points that her opponent, ranked eight places higher at 52, 
created in the first set.

That
 extra edge is partly a product of her tennis upbringing being outside 
the norm, having taken herself off to Nick Bollettieri’s tennis academy 
in Florida at the age of 12. It is notable that the three British 
survivors into the  second round have all largely done their own thing 
in their development. Naomi Broady has long been an outsider from any 
centralised system and Andy Murray has rarely ever been a part of it — 
who knows, the Lawn Tennis Association might just discern a message in 
there somewhere.

The LTA did
 provide financial support, it should be said, but after Watson helped 
spare the organisation’s blushes by winning, she extolled the virtues of
 branching out on her own.

‘I
 couldn’t stay in Guernsey and when I went to visit Bollettieri I knew 
it was the place for me,’ she said. ‘One of the reasons was that the 
weather was very good and also it was so competitive. But the weather 
plays a big part.’

Interestingly,
 Watson revealed that she has never been asked by the powers that be 
about why the Florida experience has been so beneficial.

Tough: Maria Sharapova blew Samantha Murray away on Tuesday

194: Marcel Granollers beat Nicolas Mahut in four sets over 194 minutes — the longest match.

7: Jelena Jankovic is highest seed to go out

22: Victor Estrella Burgos’ Wimbledon debut lasted 22 minutes as he was forced to retire

18: Serena Williams hopes to win an 18th Grand Slam

71: Naomi Broady will earn £71,000 if she beats Caroline Wozniacki

63: Venus Williams is playing in her 63rd Grand Slam event

50: Feliciano Lopez is the fourth man in history to compete in 50 consecutive Grand Slams

22: Agnieszka Radwanska has won her last 22 first-round matches at Grand Slams

One
 trusts that this might happen with the arrival of veteran coaching guru
 Bob Brett at the LTA as head of player development. A key appointment 
of Canadian chief executive Michael Downey, the Australian speaks with a
 velvet voice but wields a well- disguised iron fist. There could be no 
complaining about the efforts put in by Samantha Murray and Smethurst, 
two grafters whose struggles around the bleaker outposts of the circuit 
were rewarded with the financial bonanza of the £27,000 minimum in 
prize-money that comes with a wildcard.

Not
 only are there such luxuries as chauffeur-driven transport at events 
like Wimbledon, their financial reward exceeds the total pot on offer at
 some of the tournaments in which they play.

The
 closest Murray has ever got to Court No 1 has been purely as a fan, or 
as a temporary employee of the All England Club seven years ago when she
 worked in the office handing out accreditation badges.

Now
 she was out there against the unforgiving figure of tournament 
second-favourite Maria Sharapova whom, after a few close early games, 
she managed to detain for 58 minutes before succumbing 6-1, 6-0.

Too big: Similarly, Daniel Smethurst couldn't quite match up to American John Isner

At
 the start of May it was the proud boast of Smethurst, a 23-year-old 
from Manchester, that he had won more professional matches in 2014 than 
any other player, even if they came very much on the lower tiers.

His
 reward on his Grand Slam debut was to face the gargantuan serve of 6ft 
9in American No 1 John Isner,  something he described as ‘ridiculous, he
 looks so casual it’s hard to tell what he is planning to do with it’.

Smethurst
 added: ‘I didn’t realise the crowd would get into it so much. I was 
overwhelmed by that.  I’ve never had a crowd backing me like that 
before. That was a great experience. Maybe I was a bit  too intense in 
the first set, that’s something I need to learn in best of five 
matches.’

He handled the 
occasion well early on and created three break points at 3-3. The third 
was saved with a 134mph ace which, as Nicolas Mahut — Isner’s opponent 
in the 70-68 marathon in 2010 — could tell him, is just how it goes 
sometimes.

Watson could yet 
be joined by another Brit in the second round after Tara Moore levelled 
late in the evening to finish at 4-6, 7-6 against the beaten 2010 
finalist Vera Zvonareva.

The
 talented but under-achieving British No 6, faced with a player who has 
won only one match this year due to persistent shoulder injuries, fought
 back from 3-1 in the tiebreak to take it into a deciding set on Wednesday.
