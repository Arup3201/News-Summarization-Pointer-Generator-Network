Leicester earned the win they desperately needed on Friday night to avert an early-season crisis but their injury epidemic has claimed another England casualty, with Tom Croft ruled out for six weeks.

One step forward, one step back. No sooner had the Tigers ended a run of three consecutive defeats than they were forced to confirm that their England flanker had a knee operation on Thursday and will miss the autumn internationals.

Leicester director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, revealed: ‘Crofty’s had a screw taken out of his knee that was irritating the joint. He’s probably six weeks away from playing. It is disappointing for him and us.’

Croft has long been blighted by injuries. The Lion missed almost the whole of last season after suffering serious knee damage. He was side-lined for half of the previous campaign after major neck surgery. Short bursts of activity are being interrupted by long spells of recuperation. It is a worrying pattern for the 28-year-old.

Leicester already had a long injury list, so the loss of another key man is the last thing Cockerill needed. For England, Croft becomes the latest absentee up front, joining the likes of Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero, Tom Youngs, Geoff Parling and Tom Johnson.

This injury bulletin overshadowed a vital win for the embattled Tigers. It wasn’t pretty or emphatic, but the result was all that mattered. They had circled the wagons in the run-up to this match, amid tough questions about Cockerill’s regime, and the siege mentality produced the desired outcome. They tightened their game to suit the grim conditions and a dominant pack saw them through.

Blaine Scully’s early try set the nervous home side on their way and the boot of Owen Williams, though erratic at times, contributed the other 17 points. Freddie Burns’ tactical kicking turned the screw on Quins, Mathew Tait excelled at full back and the Tigers were particularly well served by several forwards, led by man of the match Graham Kitchener, Jamie Gibson and Fraser Balmain.

The immediate upshot is that Leicester — who came in on the back of defeats to Bath, London Irish and Gloucester — climbed three places to seventh in the table and avoided a first four-game losing run for a decade. Yet, this meant more than just four league points. There was palpable relief at Welford Road as the Tigers did enough to stop the rot and, potentially, generate vital confidence ahead of next week’s start of the new European Champions Cup.

Cockerill said: ‘I’m happy for the players and for the club as a whole. We’ve stuck together and this relieves the pressure a bit. But it’s not all fixed yet; it’s just one game. Hopefully, we have come through the other side, but we’ll see in the next few weeks.’

Leicester went ahead with a fourth-minute try, courtesy of a slick counter-attack. Ben Youngs and Manu Tuilagi combined to send Gibson clear out wide and the flanker drew the last defender before releasing Scully to scorch clear and round to the posts. Williams and Nick Evans engaged in a kicking duel for the bulk of a disjointed game until Quins rallied with a late try. Nine minutes from time, the visitors sent a penalty to the left corner, won the lineout, drove repeatedly infield and Karl Dickson stepped through a gap to score.

Evans converted and that was enough to snatch a bonus point. Quins boss Conor O’Shea said: ‘We got stuck in the middle of the pitch and they won the kicking contest. We didn’t play in the right areas of the pitch and our lineout didn’t function.’
