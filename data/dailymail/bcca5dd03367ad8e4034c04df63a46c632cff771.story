Nine South African police officers charged with murdering a Mozambican taxi driver who was dragged from a police vehicle were denied bail yesterday.

Most of the suspects kept their heads bowed as they were photographed in the dock at Benoni Magistrates' Court, east of Johannesburg.

They are accused of killing taxi driver Mido Macia, 27, who died after he was tied to a police van and dragged through the street last month.

All nine suspects were denied bail at Benoni Magistrates' Court on Tuesday

Shocking video footage captured the 
moment he was handcuffed to the van after he allegedly blocked the road 
and resisted arrest.

He was found dead two hours later in a police cell in Daveyton.

Mr Macia's death sparked anger and protests across South Africa and Mozambique.

Magistrate Sam Makamu said yesterday it was not in the interests of justice to grant the officers bail.

On Monday, prosecutor December Mthimunye said Mr Macia died from lack of oxygen and suffered head lacerations.

He said the driver died of hypoxia, 
had haemorrhaging in his right lung and tissue around his heart, 
suffered bruises to his genitals and also forearm injuries, suggesting 
he was fending off blows, according to the South African Press 
Association (Sapa). Â 

Defence lawyer Lokhimbar Dikatope said
Mr Macia had been involved in a road accident days before his 
death in which several children were killed.

He said a case of culpable homicide had been opened against him.

Mr Dikatope added that each of the 
suspects were the main breadwinners for their families and had served in
the police force with distinction.

Magistrate Mr Makamu said he was 
concerned the police would be released into an 'unfavourable' climate if
they were granted bail, Sapa reported.

He said the suspects may try to speak to witnesses and said they must stay in prison until at least the next hearing.

Crowds of protestors had gathered outside the courthouse calling for the suspects to be remanded in custody.

Moses Dlamini, spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Directorate, said the next hearing for the police is April 12.

On Saturday, Mr Macia was buried in Mozambique before a crowd that included his distraught wife and parents.

'Our feeling is very deep. We hope he rests in peace,' Mr Macia's Xinguinhane Vuma said at his funeral.

The scandal is the latest to undermine confidence in South Africa's police, heaping yet more shame on a
force that opened fire on striking workers at the Marikana platinum 
mine in August last year, killing 34 people.

Friends described Mr Macia as a humble man and spoke of the profound shock his death has caused in the community of Matola Rio where his father is a local leader.

Around 2,000 people attended the funeral.
