England's Fran Halsall claimed Glasgow gold with victory in the 50 metres freestyle at the Tollcross Swimming Centre on Saturday night.

The 24-year-old raced to victory in a Commonwealth Games record of 23.96 seconds to edge out Australia's Cate Campbell by 0.04secs.

It was England's third gold medal in the pool after the successes of Ben Proud and Chris Walker-Hebborn.

Shocked relief: Fran Halsall carried on her strong form from the qualifiers to win another English gold

Halsall, who won silver in the event in Delhi, said she always believed such a time was in her.

'That was the target all year. I knew I was ready to swim it which made me more nervous,' she said.

'It made me feel a little bit sick before I started because I wanted to get the results which I knew I could do and perform in a big final against some amazingly talented girls.

'In the last five metres I was thinking, "No way am I winning this, I need to get my hand on the wall". I am really happy and quite emotional.'

Halsall's team-mate Amy Smith came home eighth, with Scotland's Sian Harkin one place better off.
