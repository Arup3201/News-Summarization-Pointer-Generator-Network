'The Hunt is Over!'

So reads a wooden sign visible in an Oregon couple's engagement photo. A woman smiles with a firearm -- as her 'captured' fiance dangles trapped and upside-down.

The photo of bride Stevie Beard and groom Brady Hogevoll is now being widely circulated online - and took some careful planning to even make happen, Buzzfeed News reported.

Joshua Rainey, who captured the photograph, told the website 'I shot the photo on a property owned by Brady's parents. They have over 150 acres along the Siletz River [in Oregon]. The whole family is very into elk hunting and even hosts Make-A-Wish elk hunts on occasion. 

Bagged: Stevie Beard is set to marry her fiance Brady Hogevoll in September. The couple's engagement photo has been widely circulated online 

Long time coming? The couple has known each other since the age of nine and went out further down the road

'Stevie and Brady came up with the idea and surprised me with it during engagement photos. We worked together to figure out how the image should look and set it up quickly before sunset.

'It was rather tough to get the shot though, since Brady could only be upside down for a few minutes. Brady tied his own knots and got himself hooked up to the tractor and then his dad lifted him up slowly.'

The Oregonian reported that Beard saw other hunting-related engagement snaps and wanted the couple to try a new spin. She is a dental hygienist and Hogevoll is a tugboat captain, according to the newspaper.

In an interview with the news outlet, Beard said 'So I told Brady, "What if we did one, and we hung you from the tractor?" And he looked at me and was like, "Well, by my ankles?"'

The Oregonian reported Hogevoll tested knots ahead of the engagement photo shoot, and Beard's father created the sign. Beard passed the photo along to the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the newspaper reported.

On the foundation's Facebook page, over 163,000 Facebook users have already 'liked' the photo, and over 30,000 have shared it online.

According to The Oregonian, the couple has known each other since the age of nine. 

'Hunting is just a small part of our lives. It just happened to go viral,' Beard told the newspaper.

She also said of seeing the photo everywhere 'At first, it's really shocking. You don't ever expect for your face or your picture to go all over the country.'

Beard and Hogevoll are planning to marry September 5 this year.
