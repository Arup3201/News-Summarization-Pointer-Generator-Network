A NSW physiotherapist already facing trial for raping a patient was sensationally re-arrested while on bail after two more alleged victims contacted police.

The two alleged victims claim they were indecently assaulted during physiotherapy appointments with Mr Youngjin Jung at a Central Coast clinic.

The 34-year-old healthcare worker's re-arrest came the day after he'd been released on bail to await trial for the rape and indecent assault of a 57-year-old patient at the Ocean Beach Road Physiotherapy clinic at Umina Beach on June 7.

Two women contacted police following Youngjin Jung's arrest on Friday to allege they too had been indecently assaulted during appointments on the NSW Central Coast

A NSW police spokesperson said: 'About 11.30am on Saturday 7 June 2014, a 57-year-old woman attended a physiotherapy clinic on Ocean Beach Road at Umina Beach for treatment.

'Police will allege during a massage, the woman was sexually and indecently assaulted.

'Police from Brisbane Water Local Area Command were notified and commenced an investigation into the incident.'

The two new alleged victims, aged 47 and 52, contacted police following Youngjin Jung's arrest on Friday.

The physiotherapist was out on bail and was set to appear at Woy Woy Local Court on 17 June 2014 when the new allegations were made.

However, he was re-arrested at his Ourimbah home at about 7.30pm on Saturday and charged with four additional counts of indecent assault.

He spent the night behind bars and appeared at Gosford Bail Court on Sunday.

He was charged with four counts of assault with acts of indecency and granted strict conditional bail.

Inquiries are continuing and police are urging anyone with information to come forward.
