Couple: Alan Whicker in 1999 with his long-term partner Valerie Kleeman, 24 years his junior

He had an unparalleled career in broadcasting, in which he exquisitely exposed the foibles of the  rich, the famous and the infamous, but Alan Whicker guarded his own personal life with an obsessive dedication.

Assisted by his long-term partner Valerie Kleeman, 24 years his junior, the charismatic Alan hid himself away for the last two years of his life at his mansion in Jersey, while his health deteriorated, declining inducements to journey to London or indulge his passion for travel.

And now it transpires that the globe-trotting documentary-maker took a secret to his grave — his real age.

The much-parodied TV star knocked off four years, making him 87, as is recorded in his Who’s Who entry and given by the BBC in the announcement of his death last week. But, in fact, Whicker died of pneumonia aged 91.

Some might consider the debonair gent a tad mischievous to tell a white lie about how old he was, not least because one of his best-known TV exposés was his despatch decades ago about how the LA set were resorting to plastic surgery — in order to look younger.

Whicker, I can reveal, was born on August 2, 1921, in Cairo, where his father was a serving Army officer.

But when the Whicker’s World presenter was first asked by Who’s Who for his personal details, he gave his birthdate as August 2, 1925.

Of course, Whicker is not the first celebrity to disguise their age. Joan Collins omits her 1933 birth year in Who’s Who after 2009 (she turned 80 this May).

Says a colleague: ‘I once saw Alan’s birth certificate and can confirm he was 91.’

Disguising his age: Whicker (pictured with Kleeman in this undated photograph) gave his birthdate as August 2, 1925 when first asked by Who's Who for his personal details

As an apparent ladies’ man, Whicker was happy to portray himself as younger than he really was.

When asked which six objects he would take with him to a desert island, he replied: ‘Two blondes, two brunettes and two redheads.’

In reality, however, he spent the last 44 years of his life devoted to Valerie, whom he met in 1969.

They moved to Jersey in 1972 and she took the photographs for his travel books and produced his later documentaries.

When Sir Trevor Nunn arrived at the Henley Festival to catch a glimpse of The Beach Boys creaking around the stage, he found his entrance blocked by a clipboard jobsworth.

Having failed to recognise the famous beardy, he told theatre director Nunn that he would not be allowed in.

‘There was quite a kerfuffle until someone realised who he was,’ says a fellow music lover.

Can you imagine Sir Trevor’s erstwhile consort, fiesty Italian firecracker Nancy Dell’Olio, putting up with such insolence?

Atty turns the petrolheads

Striking sight: Atty (Alexandra) Gordon-Lennox, 29, was sporting a dramatically half-shaved head

Among the beautiful classic motor cars which pitched up for the annual Festival Of Speed yesterday, there was an even more striking sight on the lawn of Lord March’s Goodwood estate in Sussex.

His elder daughter, Atty (Alexandra) Gordon-Lennox, 29, who is based in San Francisco where she is studying psychology, had returned home sporting a dramatically half-shaved head.

As she mingled with guests including Sir Jackie Stewart and Sir Terence Conran at the Cartier champagne reception, she tells me: ‘The new hair was just a crazy day. I got bored of my long hair and one of my friends did it for me and it was  just for fun.

‘It is a ridiculous hairstyle, but I like it. I like just having a bit of a play and not taking things too seriously.’

However, her motoring-loving father is not so enthusiastic. Atty admits: ‘I’m not sure Dad likes it.

‘He’s very sweet and is always very kind about whatever hairstyle I come home with — but I think he prefers me looking more feminine.’

Of her new life across the pond, she adds: ‘I have an American boyfriend called Sean.

‘I haven’t been out with many Englishmen because I have been travelling and haven’t lived in Britain since I was 23. I am a free spirit.

Despite attending one of the best behavioural clinics in the world, Antony Worrall Thompson still has no idea what prompted his shoplifting spree.

Nineteen months after he was caught stealing wine, onions and coleslaw from his local Tesco, the chef says that even after having counselling here and attending the ‘very expensive’ Cottonwood Clinic in Arizona, he still doesn’t know why he did it.

Psychiatrists, he says, tried to make a connection between his five instances of theft and his being abused as a child — but he isn’t convinced.

‘I did wrong and I don’t know why I did it,’ says Antony. ‘It was a  mini breakdown, there’s no doubt about that.’

Antony, 62, compares his behaviour with the time Hugh Grant got caught with Los Angeles prostitute Divine Brown. ‘He can get any woman in the world that he wants. And what does he do? He wants to be caught.’

It’s not unusual when a son declines to follow in father’s footsteps for Papa to be a bit disappointed.

But not in the case of former F1 world champion Damon Hill, who has welcomed his 22-year-old son Josh’s decision to give up motor-racing after seven years — and become a rock drummer in a band.

‘I hate this idea that children are horses and they have to be bred into a particular thing,’ Damon tells me.

‘Josh was born into a big motor-racing family and I think there was always going to be a question over whether it was his calling.

‘He felt it was something he was expected to do, but he has to love what he does. That’s the important thing.’

However, Damon adds: ‘It’s the end of a phase, really, for us as far as the Hill racing dynasty goes.’

Mick’s crimper to wash and go

Married: Lee Stafford is whisking his bride of six months, glamour model Jessica-Jane Clement, to New York

Who will tend the unkempt locks of Sir Mick Jagger while his crimper Lee Stafford is in America? 

Lee is whisking his bride of six months, glamour model Jessica-Jane Clement, to New York because she wants to re-invent herself as a proper actress.

‘Jessica has been accepted on a method acting course in Manhattan and I’ve got important business in America,’ asserts Lee grandly at a bash at Covent Garden’s Film Museum.

Lee, 46, whose clients include the Countess of Mornington (aka make-up artist Jemma Kidd), wed 28-year-old reality TV star Jessica at the Duke of Rutland’s Belvoir Castle.

Sir Mick won’t miss his stylist for long: the couple will return to Lee’s Soho apartment, which is being refurbished for married life.

‘We want children,’ he explains.

PS What portly character is staying at the world’s toughest fat farm — only to put on weight?

Wobble forward showbiz agent Jonathan Shalit, whose clients include Myleene Klass and Kelly Brook. Shalit booked into the £1,500-a-night Austrian clinic Viva Mayr last week, together with his wife, fashion designer Katrina Sedley.

Apparently, Katrina  has been trying to get him to lose weight ever since their marriage three years ago — to little avail.

After just a couple of days at the spa, Jonathan texts me in desperation: ‘They have poked and prodded me, served me stale bread for which I have paid a fortune. They have given me infusions, mineral analysis and electrolysis — and I have put on 1.5kg!’

Adds Jonathan: ‘But I am £10,000 lighter.’
