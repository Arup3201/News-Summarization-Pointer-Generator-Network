Changing jobs too often can be bad for your career, a survey suggests.

It found that workers who have five or more posts over a decade are less appealing to potential employers.

Nine in ten bosses said they were likely to drop an applicant from consideration if they thought the individual had moved around too much during their working life.

Recruitment firm Robert Half interviewed 200 bosses about whether a large number of job changes would make them suspect a candidate might lack staying power.

Thirty-six per cent of the executives admitted they were ‘very likely’ to look badly on an applicant they considered a ‘job hopper’ and 53 per cent said they were ‘somewhat likely’ to do the same.

The remainder did not care about the number of jobs held.

‘The job market has rebounded in recent years, and employers understand that job candidates may have had short stints in some positions,’ said Phil Sheridan of Robert Half.

‘However, businesses look for people who will be committed to the organisation, can contribute to the company, and help it reach its short and long-term goals.

The survey found that 90 per cent of bosses were put off by applicants who have moved jobs too often (file picture of models above)

‘Too much voluntary job hopping can be a red flag.’

Research by the company puts the ideal stay in a job as six years, but this was from a worker’s point of view, not that of a potential employer.

Mr Sheridan added: ‘While there is no optimal time to stay in a job, the secret is to show progression.

‘This can come in the form of promotion and/or additional work responsibility and often takes four or more years to attain, on average.’
