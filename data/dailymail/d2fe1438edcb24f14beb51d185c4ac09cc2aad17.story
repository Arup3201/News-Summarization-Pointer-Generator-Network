Manchester City will take on Real Madrid in the Champions League after they were drawn together in Group D.

The two giants of European football will go head to head in the group stages, which kick off next month. They will also take on Ajax and Borussia Dortmund in a difficult group.

Chelsea, who won the tournament in May, face a tough test after being drawn in the same group as Italian giants Juventus, plus Shakhtar Donetsk and Nordsjaelland.

Manchester United will be happy to go up against Braga, Galatasaray and Cluj, while Arsenal will be confident of progressing from a group with Schalke, Olympiakos and Montpellier.

Celtic, however, face daunting matches against Spanish giants Barcelona, as well as games against Spartak Moscow and Benfica.

City, who look certain to strengthen before the transfer window closes on Friday night, will come up against a Real Madrid side who beat Barcelona over two legs in the Spanish Super Cup.

Jose Mourinho's side have not been particularly active in the transfer market but have added Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric to an already exciting side. He joins the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria in the Spanish capital.

Ronaldo admitted that Group D was the toughest: 'It is the most difficult group in my opinion and I think that's the same for most people,' he said.'But we are champions of Spain and we are ready to compete with everybody.'

Borussia Dortmund meanwhile have won the Bundesliga title two years running and also won the German Cup last season. They also boast some formidable attacking options with Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze in the side.

The current Ajax side may lack the class of the teams from the 90s but Frank de Boer has made an impressive start to his managerial career and the Dutch club should not be treated lightly.

Arsenal may well view their group as lacking a giant but full of tricky fixtures.

Schalke boast the attacking options of Swiss star Tranquillo Barnetta and Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar while a trip to Greece to face Olympiakos is never one to take lightly.

Arsene Wenger's men will have to find a way past former Manchester United keeper Roy Carroll who joined the Greek side in January. Rounding off the group are French champions Montpellier who won their first top flight title last season.

Reigning champions Chelsea will be confident of qualifying for the knockout stages and their toughest test looks set to come from Juventus. The Italian champions returned to the top of the tree in Serie A last season but it is a long time since they tasted success on the European front. Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba could feature in the matches between the sides.

Shakhtar Donetsk look set to hold on to star player Willian who has attracted interest from Tottenham over the summer. The Ukrainian side will be a tough nut to crack at home but are unlikely to pose much of a danger at Stamford Bridge.

The final side, Nordsjaelland, won their first Danish title last season and the minnows will do well to take anything from the Blues. They will however feature Andreas Laudrup, the son of Swansea manager Michael.

Former Blues assistant Ray Wilkins expects the Londoners to top the group despite the difficulty of travelling to Shakhtar and Italian champions Juventus.

'You'd expect them to go through, probably as top of the group,' he said.

'Shakhtar is a difficult game. It's a great stadium there but it's a lot of travelling and you don't want to be doing too much of that and Juventus is a classic game.

'They were undefeated last year, they have their own ground now, which is very compact.

'That will be a very difficult game but Chelsea have a fantastic squad now.'

Finally, Manchester United will once again be considered to have been handed a straightforward draw but Sir Alex Ferguson's men failed to qualify from a similarly 'easy' group last season.

United will take on Portuguese side Braga for he first time in their history and will visit the three-sided ground carved into a quarry.

Turkish side Galatasaray will provide their familiar formidable welcome and boast several former Premier League players in their ranks. Johan Elmander (Bolton), Emmanuel Eboue (Arsenal) and former Liverpool players Milan Baros and Albert Riera are set to feature.

Romanian champions Cluj won their third title of the decade last season and will face English competition for the second time having played Chelsea in the 2008/09 season when they held the Stamford Bridge side to a draw in Romania.

Ferguson has warned United not to make any 'stupid errors' in the Champions League.

'We have the experience of playing against Galatasaray in the past and we will always remember the "Welcome to Hell" banners,' he told the club's official website. So it's always a difficult type of match.

'We have drawn Portuguese clubs a number of times over the past few years - the likes of Benfica, Sporting [Lisbon] and Porto - so we have the experience of playing in Portugal on many occasions.

'Braga are one of the improving teams in that country.

'Obviously, we've never played Cluj before but, after the experience of last year, we don't want to make any stupid errors this time. We will play our strongest team to make sure we get through.'

Meanwhile, Manager Neil Lennon declared himself delighted after Celtic were drawn against Barcelona, Benfica and Spartak Moscow in the Champions League.

'It is fantastic to be involved with the draw, very exciting and to be in a group with Barcelona - tough but real glamour games for the club - and the other two are huge clubs in their respective countries.

'We have familiar with all three clubs, we have recent history against all three of those teams.

'I remember under Gordon (Strachan) we played Barcelona and Benfica and we knocked out Moscow in a play-off.

'It's a tough, tough group but all the teams play football so it should be attractive to watch.

'Let's not get carried away, let's see what fixtures are coming up.

'We are in it, it is fantastic to be here and we are going to make the most of it and enjoy it.'
