Teachers at a college are holding emergency classes over Easter after students due to sit A-levels in a few weeks were taught the wrong syllabus.

The health and social care course was taught at Solihull Sixth Form College in the West Midlands from September to 36 students whose university places depend on their grade.

College bosses have apologised and written to the universities explaining the students are not to blame. 

The mishap, which was announced via a letter to parents, has outraged the families involved.

One mother, who did not wish to be named, said: 'This is a serious error and now they are expecting students to go into college to learn this extra work.

'Some students have booked to go away for Easter.

'They are asking students to forget everything they have learned for the past six months and learn something completely new.

'One student apparently ran out of the class in tears when they were told about this. This is their futures we are talking about.

'There is not enough time to learn a completely new unit of work.'

College principal Paul Ashdown said: 'The college takes full responsibility for this mistake and is very sorry for any stress caused to students.

'We have written to all the students affected to apologise and reassure them that we will be working extremely hard to put this right.

'There is time to correct this and our health and social care teachers will be working over the Easter break to ensure students can catch up on the outstanding work.

'As well as delivering this additional teaching, we will also be contacting the universities that all the students affected have offers with.

The college apologised for the blunder and reassured affected students

'We think student success will not be affected, but we will be alerting universities nonetheless to ensure this is taken into account.

'Our focus is to ensure no student is penalised as a result of what has happened.'

In the letter to parents, assistant principal Elizabeth Baker said: 'I am extremely sorry to inform you that a serious error has been made by our health and social care team.

'In their efforts to make a more rounded programme, the team chose a set of units which do not fit the examination board's regulations for this qualification and without remedial action none of the students will achieve their A level in health and social care.

'In order to complete the course, students need to complete a new unit.

'We are looking to use as much time as we can before the end of this term but will be seeking to use some time in the Easter holiday.

'We are also aware that many students have university places which are dependent on them achieving their predicted grades both from this qualification and others that they are studying alongside.

'We will write to the universities to explain the error that we have made and ask for them to take into consideration the upheaval and extra work needed to remedy the situation in the light of actual results achieved.'

The mix-up follows controversy at the college in January, where it emerged mock exam candidates had been banned from going to the toilet alone amid fears they would use mobile phones to search for answers.

Mr Ashdown admitted that decision was extreme but said it was made after students were caught cheating with phones during toilet breaks in last year's exams.

The college caters for 2,140 students aged 16-18. It received a 'good' rating at its last Ofsted inspection in 2013.
