Left to babysit: Thomas Durkin is standing trial after baby John-Jay Connor died from swelling on the brain and extensive internal bleeding

A man left to babysit his new girlfriend’s nine-month-old baby allegedly shook the boy to death.

Thomas Durkin, 24, is standing trial for manslaughter after baby John-Jay Connor, known as JJ, died because of injuries caused by ‘deliberate and violent shaking,’ Plymouth Crown Court heard today.

JJ’s mother Andrea Glover, 26, waved goodbye to her ‘giggling’ baby as she left him with Durkin for a few hours on June 14 last year.

The woman from Exeter, Devon returned home to discover that JJ had been rushed to hospital suffering from a swollen brain and extensive internal bleeding. He later died of his injuries and experts who examined him say they could not have been the result of an accident.

Durkin, of Plymouth, Devon, claims he picked the baby up and put him on his chest and when he fell asleep, JJ fell to the floor. He denied harming the baby and insisted what happened was a ‘complete accident’.

Prosecutor Martin Meeke told the court: ‘This defendant killed a baby who was just nine-months-old.

‘We say he did that by deliberately shaking that child violently, or it may have been a violent shake and throwing down onto a soft surface such as a sofa or a mattress.

‘As a result of this conduct the child died. It was not an accidental fall or gentle or more rigorous shaking that killed JJ but deliberate and violent shaking in which it must have been obvious that shaking would cause some injury, even if he would not have supposed that it would cause death.’

The court was told Durkin moved in with JJ and his mother at the end of March 2011 after she split with the child’s father, John Joseph Connor, 27.

Miss Glover left JJ at home when she went out in her car at 11:45am with her other son, Keaton, 3.

At 1:05pm Durkin rang 999 to report that JJ had somehow ‘fallen off his chest’ while he slept in a chair and was ‘barely responsive’.

Appearing for the prosecution, Miss Glover told the court: ‘I had got up and fed both of the kids and Tom was having a lay in.

‘At about 11am I woke Tom up and asked him if he would help me to take some stuff out of the car.

‘He said to me don’t worry about doing that and that he would look after JJ and I should go with Keaton.

‘Just before I left JJ he was giggling 
and kicking his feet and Tom had taken him out of his bouncer and he was
waving at me and Keaton from the window.’

The court heard that when Miss Glover returned, she was told by a neighbour JJ had been taken to hospital.

Mr Meeke said: ‘He says that JJ was in the rocker and apparently smiled at him, so he took the child out of the rocker and put him on his chest.

‘He told police and doctors that they both fell asleep and he woke up suddenly to find that JJ was on the floor, his eyes were half open and he was making a gargling noise but not moving.

‘He then said JJ was vomiting and he picked him up, he pinched his fingers and lightly slapped his face to get a reaction, then he shook him gently.

‘After this did not work he splashed him with bath water before calling 999.’

The jury was played a harrowing recording of the 999 call made by Durkin on the day JJ died.

They heard Durkin trying to perform CPR with the advice of the operator, before remarking: ‘He’s got bubbles coming out of his mouth.

‘It is coming out of his nose too, he is looking straight at me - he is looking as if he’s not even alive.’

During the 20 minute call, he was heard saying ‘oh my God,’ and pleading with the baby, saying ‘come on, come on boy, come on boy,’ and ‘come on JJ’.

He also told the operator JJ simply ‘fell off of him while he was asleep’.

Durkin then panicked, saying: ‘He’s going cold now, seriously, what should I do with him now?

‘He’s gone floppy and he’s cold, seriously, I think he might die, I think he’s going to die.’

Joanna Brown, the first paramedic on the scene, told the court how Durkin showed her how he shook little JJ.

She said: ‘The one thing I remember is the fact that he said he had shaken the baby to try and wake him up.

‘I remember him saying he may have been asleep with the baby and his arm fell away and the baby fell down.

‘We were in the car and he put both hands in front of him and said he shook the baby to try and wake him up.’

Referring to her statement she said: ‘I’ve described the action as not vigorous but enough to make the baby’s head go back and forward.’

After paramedics raced to the scene, JJ was airlifted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

The court heard how pathologists found no evidence that JJ died of natural causes as he was found to have haemorrhaged retinas and brain damage.

Police arrested Durkin and took him in for questioning but he stood by his account of what happened.

Durkin denies manslaughter. The trial continues.
