Manchester City's new £28million striker Wilfried Bony is set to make his debut for the champions against Newcastle United during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

The former Swansea hitman returned from the Africa Cup of Nations a winner after helping Ivory Coast win the tournament in Equatorial Guinea courtesy of a penalty shoot-out against Ghana almost two weeks ago.

No player scored more Premier League goals than Bony during 2014 after he netted 20 times for Garry Monk's side and Manuel Pellegrini has hinted he is ready to throw him straight into the action - but how will the 26-year-old fit into the City side?

Manuel Pellegrini described new signing Bony as the perfect signing for Manchester City 

Bony's inclusion from the start would mean a change in both personnel and system to the Manchester City side that beat Stoke 4-1 at the Britannia in their last Premier League outing.

Pellegrini set his team up in a 4-4-1-1 formation with Sergio Aguero operating as a loan striker and playmaker David Silva taking up his preferred position just off the front man.

Brazilian duo Fernando and Fernandinho added steel and energy in the middle of midfield, while Samir Nasri and James Milner provided the width for the visitors.

Should Bony come into the side it would almost certainly be to play alongside Aguero after the Argentina international returned to form with a brace against Mark Hughes' side last week.

‘I think he has all the conditions to be an important player because we try always to play with two strikers,' Pellegrini said of Bony at a press conference on Friday. 'He is the perfect player for our squad.

'He knows the Premier League, he knows our team so I think it will be easy for him to settle in in a good way.' 

If Pellegrini, who is certain to have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona too, is to accommodate Bony from the start against Newcastle, the Chilean manager will increase City's goal threat but ultimately weaken the defensive solidity of his side by switching to a 4-4-2.

In Aguero and Bony, however, Pellegrini has at his disposal the most potent attacking duo in the Premier League and it is hard to see past the pair forming the basis of City's strike force for the remainder of the campaign.

There is also the small matter of shoehorning Bony's compatriot Yaya Toure back into the side. In a flat midfield four the 31-year-old will be tasked with performing a deeper role alongside either Fernando or Fernandinho.

Toure has been at his most explosive best for City when he has played a more advanced and, before departing for Equatorial Guinea, he had netted six Premier League goals in his last eight games.

The midfielder is capable of performing a more defensive role, as he did at Barcelona and during the recent Africa Cup of Nations, though it wouldn't be unfair to describe Toure's performance in the tournament as underwhelming at best.

James Milner, who was superb in the victory against Stoke, will miss the game against John Carver's side  on Saturday and is also a doubt for Tuesday's Barcelona clash with Nasri and Silva likely to play as inverted wide men on Saturday.

To get the best out of Bony Manchester City will have to provide the striker with service from the wide areas meaning the full backs will be tasked with offering a threat down the flanks.

How Manuel Pellegrini could set up his side against Barcelona in the Champions League

With the Barcelona match on the horizon Pellegrini has the option of resting first choice full back pairing of Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy against Newcastle and could bring Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolorov into the side to face Newcastle.

For the first leg against Luis Enrique's side Pellegrini is unlikely to retain the 4-4-2 formation and could revert to the more defensively-minded 4-4-1-1 with Bony dropping out of the side.

Pellegrini could recall the pairing of Fernandinho and Fernando in the middle of midfield to combat the possession-based game of the La Liga side, and the 61-year-old will be desperate for Milner to shake off his knee complaint in time to play.

Should the England international fail to recover Jesus Navas' pace could be used as a weapon to hit Barcelona on the counter-attack, while Toure will miss the game through suspension meaning Silva should return to the number 10 role.
